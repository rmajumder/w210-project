  "<p>Ordinary words struggle to convey the human consequences of child abuse, and committee-speak is even less likely to do justice to its victims. The home secretary headed for the Commons to announce the seventh and eighth <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20190426\" title=\"\">institutional inquiries</a> launched since the <a href=\"http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/193179-the-other-side-of-jimmy-savile-is-revealed-on-stv-tonight/\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile paedophilia allegations</a> came to light \u2013 these concerned abuse in care homes in north Wales, and the possible inadequacy of an earlier <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4003097\" title=\"\">report</a> into this. Listening to the bickering about the scope, powers and terms of reference, it was hard to recall that the issue here was real individual men violating individual children for their own ends.</p> <p>Counterintuitive as it may be, however, this is a problem that can only be tackled by addressing institutions and culture. After all, witch-hunts against individual paedophiles have been tried in the past. The News of the World's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/846832.stm\" title=\"\">name and shame campaign</a> came and went in 2000, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/901723.stm\" title=\"\">causing chaos</a> without preventing or even exposing the sort of abuse that is currently coming to light. For the reality is that a great deal of the damage is and always has been done behind institutional walls. Eileen Fairweather explains on our comment pages how in care homes these walls are built up out of deference to abusers and disbelief of their wards. From boarding schools to the Catholic church and now the BBC, there are signs of the same story playing out \u2013 the powerful closing ranks, and the powerless keeping quiet or speaking out without being heard.</p> <p>The institutional questions that demand a response range from the specific \u2013 who on Earth handed <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2216489/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-set-Broadmoor-keys-How-sick-star-access-mentally-ill-patients.html\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile Broadmoor's keys</a>? \u2013 to more diffuse concerns. The weekend remarks by the retired head of the Duncroft approved school for troubled girls, in which she dismissed former pupils' claims about Savile as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/03/jimmy-savile-accusers-money-headteacher\" title=\"\">wild allegations by well-known delinquents</a>\", tell you everything you need to know about the culture of contempt towards vulnerable youngsters among certain professionals who were supposedly looking after them. Another problem is the traditional presumption, rooted in two centuries of English common law, that child witnesses could not be trusted. This was <a href=\"http://www.afccontario.ca/Bala%20et%20al%20on%20Childrens%20Competency.pdf\" title=\"\">overturned by statute in 1988</a>, but perhaps it took longer for the culture of the courtroom to change.</p> <p>The reported dismissal of abuse claims now back in the spotlight by Sir Ronald Waterhouse, the judge who led the original north Wales inquiry, as \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9653254/Senior-Tories-accused-over-child-abuse.html\" title=\"\">embarking on the realm of fantasy</a>\" could become a totem of that traditional disbelief. That, however, very much depends on the facts that get upturned \u2013 facts that Twittering accusers will not be patient for. That is a pity. Truth will not be advanced, nor children protected, by jettisoning the old presumption against the accuser with a new presumption of guilt for the accused.</p>",
  "<p>Florida voters once again endured hours-long lines to cast ballots in parts of the state as what may prove to be a record turnout and lengthy forms made slow going of the election, as did machine failures and some electors walking off with the pens.</p> <p>The extreme length of some queues \u2013 most were up to a two-hour wait but a few ran much longer \u2013 drew protests from the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP). It said voters were waiting five hours to cast ballots at the Jesse J McCrary Jr elementary school in a largely African American area of Miami.</p> <p>\"It deters folks who, if they have a busy schedule, can't afford to stand in line for hours,\" said Derek Turner, the communications director of the NAACP. \"But we're seeing a lot of determination from voters. They are sticking it out in the lines.\"</p> <p>Voters at the the South Kendall Community church in Miami also reported waiting more than five hours. Some said there were fewer voting machines than in previous elections. The Miami Herald that some people were giving up waiting because they had jobs to get to.</p> <p>Students voting at the University of South Florida in Tampa waited nearly two hours in part because many had to re-register their addresses to be able to cast their ballot in the district.</p> <p>But delays were far shorter at other polling stations in the Tampa area which has often been the key to winning Florida in presidential elections.</p> <p>Florida's secretary of state, Ken Detzner, foresaw a record turnout for the election.</p> <p>\"I don't have any projections to make except that we'll probably have a record setting year in terms of turnout,\" he said.</p> <p>But the queues in Florida may yet be the basis of a court battle if the state proves decisive in the outcome of the election. Democrats have already filed a lawsuit over the long wait people were forced to endure during early voting over the past week which put down a marker for potential future court action.</p> <p>Long lines were also reported in parts of Ohio, which may yet prove to be the most crucial of swing states. But queues were common across the country as people turned out in large numbers for what has been billed by some as the most important election in more than a generation.</p> <p>Poll watchers are giving Florida special scrutiny because of its part in the 2000 presidential election fiasco that put George W Bush in the White House. Some reported problems that could also contribute to legal action if the result in the state is as close as in 2000, when it came down to just 537 votes.</p> <p>Democratic congresswoman Kathy Castor said she visited at least 10 polling stations in her Tampa area district and that while the lines to vote were short some people were being turned away by officials because the address in the election register did not match their ID.</p> <p>\"What concerns me is that people can change their addresses without having to leave. But people are leaving without voting. We've taken this up with the supervisory folk,\" she said.</p> <p>Castor said she had seen \"a few dozen cases\" of the problem.</p> <p>Independent poll watchers from a group called Election Protection said there was also an issue with voters being removed from the electoral roll without their knowledge because they did not cast a ballot in the last presidential election. They identified more than a dozen people at two Tampa election stations, at Fair Oaks Park and C Blythe Andrews Jr public library, alone.</p> <p>Another group, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that some voters who showed up at Tampa polling places were directed to another precinct. The committee blamed election officials, saying they gave wrong information to voters. Some then voted by provisional ballot but it's not clear if they will be counted.</p> <p>The failure of electronic ballot scanners in various parts of Florida led to votes being set aside for counting after the polls close at 7pm.</p> <p>Independent watchdogs reported a problem with names missing from the voters' roll in Philadelphia which they attributed to a failure to update the lists with people who registered recently.</p> <p>Separately, a judge in Philadelphia ordered that Republican poll watchers be allowed into voting stations after it was reported they were barred from some locations by Democrats.</p> <p>There were reports of election day glitches \u2013 faulty voting machines, absentee poll workers and long lines \u2013 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where turnout was also high.</p> <p>The city put out an urgent call for more poll workers after some did not turn up for their shifts.</p>",

Who will robocall what lie, what machine will break, <strong>who will <em>steal the election</em></strong> in any of the few remaining battleground states? One YouTube of a voting machine not registering someone's Obama vote, and everyone's on edge all day.</p> <p>In Fairfax, Virginia, the largest county in the state that sits along the red-blue line dividing \"Old Virginia\" \u2013 Southern, white \u2013 from \"New Virginia\" \u2013 young people, professionals, yuppies, minorities, and other non-Real Americans \u2013 the elementary schools that serve as polling stations are enveloped in surveillance. What if there's some kind of organized racket or voting machine issue that screws up the tally in one of the most important counties in the country? It would only be surprising if someone didn't give it a shot.</p> <p>So that's why outside of Mosby Woods School in the residential town of Vienna, Virginia, the end of the DC Metro's Orange subway line, we weren't the only ones waiting to badger voters as they tried to perform their civic duty in peace and quiet.</p> <p>Three Republican party volunteers greeted all incoming voters with sample-ballots. Voters were then handed off to an Asian-American voters' activist, who ensured that members of this large international community in Fairfax had everything in order and understood where they needed to go.</p> <p>Two poll watchers, at the door, and more along the way, through the long line that was about to get much longer as the workday ended.</p> <p>And then, when they exited, two other Asian-American voters' activists offering surveys in at least Chinese and Korean \u2013 one voter requested Tibetan \u2013 followed by a voting machine monitor to keep track of malfunctions, and lastly, a Guardian reporter asking them personal questions about their politics, for publication.</p> <p>We chose to visit Mosby Woods after reading an early-day blurb about a voting machine failure there. Was this a scandalous failure, designed to suppress the Asian-American vote which went 62% nationally for President Obama in 2008? Was someone <em>stealing the election at this very elementary school?</em></p> <p>Nope. The voting machine monitor explained that the thing just had a glitch, or stalled for a minute. It slowed down the process, briefly, but the flow of voters resumed shortly afterwards. Not a big deal, at all.</p> <p>Now where's the fun in that, when every glitch reported across the country doesn't turn out to be a breathtaking scandal?</p> <p><em>Jim Newell</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T22:43:43.528Z\">at 10.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50999062b579f74bac764bba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T22:34:10.699Z\">10.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What happened to the supposed falloff in <strong>voter enthusiasm</strong> from 2008?

There were 4 older ladies running the show and 3 voting booths that are similar to a science fair project in how they fold up. They had an oval VOTE logo on top center and a cartridge slot on the left that the volunteers used to start your ballot.</p> <p>I initially selected Obama but Romney was highlighted. I assumed it was being picky so I deselected Romney and tried Obama again, this time more carefully, and still got Romney. Being a software developer, I immediately went into troubleshoot mode. I first thought the calibration was off and tried selecting Jill Stein to actually highlight Obama. Nope. Jill Stein was selected just fine. Next I deselected her and started at the top of Romney's name and started tapping very closely together to find the 'active areas'. From the top of Romney's button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside Obama's name was all active for Romney. From the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the Obama button (basically a small white sliver) is what let me choose Obama. Stein's button was fine. All other buttons worked fine.</p> <p>I asked the voters on either side of me if they had any problems and they reported they did not. I then called over a volunteer to have a look at it. She him hawed for a bit then calmly said \"It's nothing to worry about, everything will be OK.\" and went back to what she was doing.

For every inch above normal rainfall, overall turnout drops by a little less than 1%, but Democratic turnout drops by 2.5%. Every inch above average snowfall decreases turnout by 0.5%. Since the water equivalent of 10 inches of snow usually equals an inch of rain, it's more likely snow will effect an election. [...]</p> <p>Florida is the one state where rain could change have more an impact. There will be showers in the northern half of the state including the key I-4 corridor. Even so, the race would have to be about a point to a point and a half tighter than polling average for the weather to have an effect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Harry takes a more in-depth look at the forecasts for different parts of 10 swing states <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/06/election-day-weather-forecast-florida\">here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509927dab579f74bac764b8d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T15:08:10.246Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>The Guardian's Ed Pilkington is in <strong>Cheviot, Ohio</strong>, a suburb of Cincinnati in Hamilton county in the south-west of the state:</em></p> <p>Carol Ann McIlmurray, 56, is precisely the kind of person Romney needs to attract in large numbers here today.

Most residents of the White Mountain village then were railroad workers who had to be on the job during normal polling hours.

But others were allowed to stand, including the cutting of the number of days for early voting which contributed to the huge queues that meant some people <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/05/campaigns-legal-battles-swing-states\">waited more than eight hours to cast a ballot</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Republicans say the new measures were necessary to combat fraud. But as the American Civil Liberties Union has noted, more people are attacked by sharks in Florida than convicted of election fraud.&#xa0;That has helped fire up some of the president's supporters who see Florida's Republican party machinations as trampling on their democratic rights.&#xa0;</p> <p>But many Republicans who declined to vote for John McCain four years ago because he was not conservative enough, care less about the candidate they will be supporting this time than the opportunity to get rid of Obama.

What happens here today could well determine the outcome of the whole presidential race: Mitt Romney really needs to win this state if he is to have a chance of unseating Barack Obama from the White House.</p> <p>I'm going to spend today on a triangular journey through the electoral landscape of one large section of the state to sample its diversity of political complexion. There's going to be a lot of driving involved across Ohio's monotonously flat plains, but I'll be counting on country music and the rants of Rush Limbaugh on talk radio to keep me going.</p> <p>First stop is a suburb of Cincinnati, one of Romney's most crucial target areas and where Obama campaigned Sunday (see picture below). This area is traditionally very conservative, the heartland of Ohio's God-fearing, straight-living south-western people. But in 2008 Obama became only the second Democratic presidential candidate to win in Hamilton county in which Cincinnati is situated since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.</p> <p>After that, it's a two-hour drive due north to Greenville, a country town in the rural west of Ohio. This is pure Republican country, dependable and unwavering. McCain swept Darke county in which Greenville is located by a resounding 68% to Obama's 30%.</p> <p>The outcome here is not in doubt \u2013 for such a deep red county to turn blue would require a magician to pour some potent liberal potion into the local drinking water. But it will be interesting to see how dyed-in-the-wool conservatives are feeling about Romney's prospects, and the future of the country if he loses tonight.</p> <p>Then I will cut across country due east to the state capital, Columbus. The city is very mixed politically. It has a buzzing university scene as home to Ohio state university, which lends it a lot of Democratic-voting young people. In 2008 Obama won Franklin county around Columbus handsomely, by 59% to McCain's 40%.</p> <p>But the city also acts as the state's main financial centre and has a deep conservative tradition. I'll go to a polling station in a northern suburb, where political opinion is very mixed to take soundings there about which way the wind is blowing.</p> <p><em>Ed Pilkington in Cincinnati</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1468dee4-e522-4638-9e06-3a9ee2c297c8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352207674001/4de6e7c6-bc92-4f8a-9331-b0ecbfa5555b-460.jpeg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama greets supporters as he arrives at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 4 November, 2012.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama greets supporters as he arrives at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sunday.

About 100 million Americans are going to enter a booth or lean over a machine and vote today (<a href=\"http://elections.gmu.edu/early_vote_2012.html\">nearly 32 million</a> have voted already). With any luck we'll know who the winner is sometime tonight.</p> <p>Every presidential election is significant. That's true of this one, only more so. The candidates have described sharply contrasting plans to strengthen the economy, secure the nation and attack the debt. They are beholden to constituencies with radically different visions of what an ideal American society would look like, what rights it would guarantee and what laws it would enforce. Apart from the alma mater they share, the candidates differ in their life stories and as men, in their casts of mind, in their approaches to problems and to people. Both are outsiders, in their ways. After today's election, the story of each man will be rewritten for good. As will the country's.</p> <p><strong>Our correspondents are on the ground in eight battleground states to cover the action at the polls.</strong> We'll be talking to voters all day long to find out how they cast their ballots and why.

  "<p>With fingers crossed and mounting trepidation, same-sex marriage advocates are allowing themselves to hope that voters in a US state will finally endorse their cause after a history of false dawns and disappointments.</p> <p>Twenty-eight times referendums on same-sex marriage have been on the election ballot in US states. And 28 times, voters have either rejected the idea, overturned legislation allowing it, or approved amendments to state constitutions defining marriage as being between a man and a woman.</p> <p>This time hopes are high. Not only has there been a shift in social attitudes, according to national opinion polls, but the end of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy barring gays and lesbians from the US military, public support for marriage equality from the White House and high-profile judicial decisions overturning same-sex marriage bars on human rights grounds have raised expectations that voters may be catching up.</p> <p>And this time the referendums are taking place on more favourable grounds. Votes for or against same-sex marriage \u2013 in one form or another \u2013 are on the ballot in four states: Minnesota, Maine, Maryland and Washington. All four are among the more liberal of the blue states: all are reliably Democratic states in presidential voting.</p> <p>Yet of the four states, only tiny Maine, in America's north-east corner, is close to being a sure bet. In the other three, hopes for more victories are on hold, in some cases after last-minute ad blitzes caused polls to swing back.</p> <p>A few weeks ago in Maryland, polls were showing a solid majority backing Question 6 on the state ballot. But as <a href=\" http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-ballot-poll-20121027,0,2408785.story\">the Baltimore Sun reports</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>A month ago, the same-sex marriage question was ahead by 10 percentage points \u2013 49% to 39% \u2013 in an earlier Sun poll. The contest is now a dead heat in part because some African Americans who supported the measure or were undecided are now saying no.</p> <p>The numbers have moved amid television and radio commercials from the Maryland Marriage Alliance, which opposes same-sex marriage, and stepped-up efforts by pastors preaching against Question 6.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-maryland-statewide-likely-voter-poll-20121028,0,4340314.graphic\">latest polling in Maryland</a> had support for same-sex marriage trailing by 46% to 47%.</p> <p>In Minnesota, the battle is over a proposal to amend the state constitution banning gay marriage. But despite what the Twin Cities' Pioneer Press described as \"Minnesota's angriest electoral fight in memory,\" the <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/11/obama-up-8-in-minnesota-amendments-trail-for-passage.html#more\">last poll</a> showed a majority likely to shoot down a proposal to amend the state constitution so that \"only a union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage\".</p> <p>Yet<a href=\"http://www.twincities.com/ci_21938435/minnesota-gay-marriage-photo-id-amendments-focus-ballot\"> the Pioneer Press noted</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The marriage amendment mobilized thousands of volunteers and attracted $16m in campaign contributions, drawing far more passion than the state's presidential or Senate contests.</p> </blockquote> <p>In Washington state, Referendum 74 asks voters to either approve or reject the state's new law legalizing same-sex marriage, passed earlier this year. The most recent poll by a local TV channel <a href=\" http://www.king5.com/news/up-front/polls/KING-5-Poll-Governors-race-a-dead-heat-176770651.html\">King 5 </a>found:</p> <blockquote> <p>The poll also shows that the race over Referendum 74 has tightened. The referendum on same-sex marriage has 52% approving with 43% saying they'll reject. With ballot measures, undecided votes often lean \"no\" toward the end, and the latest King 5 poll finds 5 percent saying they're not sure. Two weeks ago, the King 5 poll had the measure leading at 54% to 41%.</p> </blockquote> <p>In Maine, where the polling in favour of gay marriage is 52% to 45%, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/11/obama-king-gay-marriage-favored-in-maine.html#more\">pollsters PPP noted</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>What we've found historically with these gay marriage ballot measures though is that undecided voters tend to end up voting anti-gay so if I had to guess this is something more like a 52/48 advantage and at that point it can go either way \u2013 this is likely to be a pretty close vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>But some in Maine recall that voters in the state launched a successful petition to overturn the state legislature's previous attempt to recognise same-sex marriage, winning the resulting referendum by 53% to 47%. That was just three years ago, in 2009.</p>",
  "<p>Staying grounded has never been a problem for Andy Murray. But, if he needed reminding of life's tougher terrain on the eve of his match against Novak Djokovic in this most glamorous of tennis tournaments, a brief chat with a stranger might have done the trick.</p> <p>\"I spent a bit of time with a guy called Jason Arday a couple of days ago,\" the new US Open champion said, before getting ready for his eighth match this year against the newly installed world No1, in the second round of the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.</p> <p>\"He is an epileptic who ran 30 marathons in 35 days. He told me that on the 20th day he fell \u2013 he had a fit, a seizure \u2013 and had a hairline fracture in his leg, but he continued. He had asked to meet me, and that was pretty cool, speaking to someone like that.</p> <p>\"He obviously loves tennis, watched the US Open. He said he was a big tennis fan and he went back on the ATP boat [from Greenwich to the team hotel] with us as well. [Juan-Mart\u00edn] del Potro was there and the Bryan brothers and stuff. So he was pretty pumped.\"</p> <p>Arday, who carried the Olympic torch through Merton, is as remarkable in his own way as Murray is on a tennis court. He could not speak until he was 11, nor read and write until he was 17. Working as a volunteer in a homeless shelter at Christmas nine years ago, he was inspired to raise money for the Shooting Star Children's Hospice.</p> <p>After seeing the comedian Eddie Izzard run 50 consecutive marathons, Arday dedicated his life to raising money for charity by the uncomplicated device of running and hopes to hit \u00a3250,000 by the time he is 50.</p> <p>As for taking care of business, Murray has an excellent chance against Djokovic. Although it took the Scot three sets to beat Tomas Berdych while Djokovic beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in two, the Serb was less impressive against the fitful Frenchman, their respective flashes of genius all that lit up the arena. The key, as ever, will be how effectively each player serves on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"I have saved a lot of break points this year,\" Murray said. \"He obviously served very well on the break points but that is something a lot of the top players do \u2013 they focus themselves well and find either a big serve or the right shots to play at the crucial moments. That can be the difference in the big matches.\"</p>",
  "<p>We are counting them out and counting them in, as the BBC man Brian Hanrahan said during the Falklands conflict. We are doing much the same as senior officials move the chairs around at the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. A very strange process it is too. There are interviews this week, but already we know that two commissioners, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/01/black-muslim-members-equalities-commission-roles\" title=\"\">\u2022 Simon Woolley and Lady Meral Hussein-Ece</a>, have been judged surplus to future requirements by the new commission chair, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/18/lady-oneill-equality-commission-chair\" title=\"\">Lady O'Neill</a>. Woolley is, at present, the only black commissioner; Hussein-Ece the only Muslim. Both were only recently told how highly regarded they were. Both were encouraged by the government to reapply. But if they are puzzled, they are not alone. For we learn of a third commissioner who won't return. <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/about-us/the-commissioners/michael-smith/\" title=\"\">Mike Smith</a> chaired the commission's statutory disability committee, played a key role on the regulatory committee and led the highly acclaimed formal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/sep/12/disabled-people-face-abuse-routinely\" title=\"\">inquiry into disability-related harassment</a>. Like Woolley and Hussein-Ece, he was the recipient of a glowing assessment and was invited to reapply. Like them, he wasn't accorded the benefit of an interview. Like them he learned his fate from a head hunter's automated email. \"I naturally am disappointed at not being reappointed for a further term,\" he said. The way this is being handled must disappoint everybody. Straight out of the human resources handbook, 1986.</p> <p>\u2022 Big love in south London meanwhile between George Galloway and Lee Jasper, the controversial former race and policing adviser to Ken Livingstone. Jasper is running in the Croydon byelection under Galloway's Respect banner. And it just shows how time can heal. Or how agendas can coincide. For back in 2004, they were hardly comrades. Jasper ran Livingstone's anti-racism festival, called Respect. Galloway pitched up with his new party, decided the name Respect was rather nifty and ran off with it. Your thing is a \"mere pop concert\", he told an aggrieved Livingstone. There were threats of legal action, but nothing came of it. Galloway registered his party and Jasper's Respect festival was renamed Rise. Galloway was triumphant. \"We get to play Aretha Franklin all day long,\" he said.</p> <p>\u2022 Since the fall of Gaddafi, Britain has tried to assist Libya's return to democratic government. Thus relations between its nascent political class and our own are cordial. But for how long? For the government of Libya has a relatively new recruit, <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/cases/samialsaadi/history/\" title=\"\">Sami al-Saadi</a>. He's the minister for martyrs, responsible for the welfare of dependents of people who died during the revolution. And when he's not busy being minister for martyrs, al-Saadi has more personal things to do. As one of the Libyan dissidents rendered to Tripoli by MI6 and Gaddafi's henchmen, he's suing the former home secretary Jack Straw, as well as MI6 and the foreign office. Advice to Straw and Q and any of the other shadowy types that may be in his sights: steer clear of Libyan airspace.</p> <p>\u2022 Though investigations and departures go on at News International, just occasionally someone achieves the distinction of departing unaccompanied by police or lawyers, untroubled by suspicion or rancour. This week hacks in the north gathered to applaud reporter <a href=\"http://journalisted.com/alastair-taylor?allarticles=yes\" title=\"\">Alastair Taylor</a>. Taylor clocked up 33 years, covering the biggest stories, but for all his experience he still fell into the trap of seeking to assess his success via Google. \"I looked to see what stories I did over the decades which had got the most hits,\" he said. \"Was it the Ripper, the Shannon Matthews case or another high-profile crime story? No, it was about <a href=\"http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/145635/Mans-sex-with-goat.html?print=yes\" title=\"\">a Hull man having sex with a goat</a> as passing train passengers looked on horrified.\" The sublime, the ridiculous. All in a day's work.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, many a reader gets in touch to ask: is it true, as you asserted yesterday, that Denis MacShane was sacked from the BBC in the 70s for calling Reginald Maudling a cook? The answer is no. The now disgraced MP lost his job after implying that the former Tory chancellor was a crook. There is a difference. It isn't yet defamatory to compare an honourable member with the likes of Gordon Ramsay. But case law is developing all the time.</p>",
  "<p>On the nauseating political doublespeak scale, David Cameron's claim to \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/05/david-cameron-arms-sales-gulf\" title=\"\">support the Arab spring</a>\" on a trip to sell weapons to Gulf dictators this week hit a new low. No stern demands for free elections from the autocrats of Arabia \u2013 or calls for respect for human rights routinely dished out even to major powers like Russia and China.</p> <p>As the kings and emirs crack down on democratic protest, the prime minister assured them of his \"respect and friendship\". Different countries, he explained soothingly in Abu Dhabi, needed \"different paths, different timetables\" on the road to reform: countries that were western allies, spent billions on British arms and sat on some of the world's largest oil reserves in particular, he might have added by way of explanation.</p> <p>Cameron went to the Gulf as a salesman for BAE Systems \u2013 the private arms corporation that makes Typhoon jets \u2013 drumming up business from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman, as well as <a href=\"smoothing\" title=\"\">smoothing ruffled</a> feathers over British and European parliamentary criticism of their human rights records on behalf of BP and other companies.</p> <p>No wonder the prime minister restricted media coverage of the jaunt. But, following hard on the heels of a similar trip by the <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/News/world/Frances+Hollande+discusses+Syria+Iran/-/1068/1611680/-/xsdoy1z/-/index.html\" title=\"\">French president</a>, the western message to the monarchies was clear enough: Arab revolution or not, it's business as usual with Gulf despots.</p> <p>The spread of protest across the Arab world has given these visits added urgency. A year ago, in the wake of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, it seemed the Gulf regimes and their western backers had headed off revolt by crushing it in Bahrain, buying it off in Saudi Arabia, and attempting to hijack it in Libya and then Syria \u2013 while successfully playing the anti-Shia sectarian card.</p> <p>But popular unrest has now reached the shores of the Gulf. In Kuwait, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/02/kuwait-protests-arab-spring\" title=\"\">tens of thousands of demonstrators</a>, including Islamists, liberals and nationalists, have faced barrages of teargas and stun grenades as they protest against a rigged election law, while all gatherings of more than 20 have been banned.</p> <p>After 18 months of violent suppression of the opposition in Bahrain, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/bahrain-military-equipment-uk\" title=\"\">armed by Britain</a> and America, the regime has outlawed all anti-government demonstrations. In western-embraced Saudi Arabia, protests have been brutally repressed, as thousands are held without charge or proper trial.</p> <p>Meanwhile, scores have been<a href=\"http://www.echr.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> jailed in the UAE</a> for campaigning for democratic reform, and in Britain's favourite Arab police state of Jordan, protests have mushroomed against a Kuwaiti-style electoral stitchup. London, Paris and Washington all express concern \u2013 but arm and back the autocrats.</p> <p>Cameron insists they <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9655254/David-Cameron-defends-legitimate-arms-deals-during-Gulf-states-tour.html\" title=\"\">need weapons to defend themselves</a>. When it comes to the small arms and equipment Britain and the US supply to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other Gulf states, he must mean from their own people. But if he's talking about fighter jets, they're not really about defence at all.</p> <p>This is effectively a mafia-style protection racket, in which Gulf regimes use oil wealth their families have commandeered to buy equipment from western firms they will never use. The companies pay huge kickbacks to the relevant princelings, while a revolving door of political corruption provides lucrative employment for former defence ministers, officials and generals with the arms corporations they secured contracts for in office.</p> <p>Naturally, western leaders and Arab autocrats claim the Gulf states are threatened by Iran. In reality, that would only be a risk if the US or Israel attacked Iran \u2013 and in that case, it would be the US and its allies, not the regimes' forces, that would be defending them. Hypocrisy doesn't begin to describe this relationship, which has long embedded corruption in <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/06/arms-bosses-plot-1996-archive\" title=\"\">a web of political, commercial and intelli gence links</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/16/bae.immigrationpolicy?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">heart of British public life</a>.</p> <p>But support for the Gulf dictatorships \u2013 colonial-era feudal confections built on heavily exploited foreign workforces \u2013 is central to western control of the Middle East and its energy resources. That's why the US has major military bases in Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, Oman and Bahrain.</p> <p>The danger now is of escalating military buildup against Iran and intervention in the popular upheavals that have been unleashed across the region. Both the US and Britain have sent troops to Jordan in recent months to bolster the tottering regime and increase leverage in the Syrian civil war. Cameron held talks with emirates leaders this week about setting up a permanent British military airbase in the UAE.</p> <p>The prime minister defended arms sales to dictators on the basis of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/05/david-cameron-gulf-arms-trip\" title=\"\">300,000 jobs in Britain's \"defence industries\"</a>. Those numbers are inflated and in any case heavily reliant on <a href=\"http://www.caat.org.uk/issues/bae/wasted-skills.php\" title=\"\">government subsidy</a>. But there's also no doubt that British manufacturing is over-dependent on the arms industry and some of that support could usefully be diverted to, say, renewable technologies.</p> <p>But even if morality and corruption are dismissed as side issues, the likelihood is that, sooner or later, these autocrats will fall \u2013 as did the Shah's regime in Iran, on which so many British and US arms contracts depended at the time. Without western support, they would have certainly been toppled already. As Rached Ghannouchi, the Tunisian leader whose democratic Islamist movement was swept to power in elections last year, predicted: \"<a href=\"http://www.tunisia-live.net/2011/12/22/washington-institute-for-near-east-policy-releases-recording-of-rachid-ghannouchi/\" title=\"\">Next year it will be the turn of monarchies</a>.\" When that happens, the western world risks a new backlash from its leaders' corrupt folly.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",
  "<p>In a scene from the new Denzel Washington film Flight, his character Whip Whitaker cracks open a can of Budweiser while behind the wheel of an aloft passenger jet. </p> <p>The can of Bud may or may not have helped Whitaker miraculously land the plane safely after it suffers a mechanical failure, but Budweiser maker Anheuser-Busch has <a href=\"http://www.wtsp.com/news/article/281263/10/Budweiser-asks-Paramount-to-cut-beer-logo-from-picture\">asked the film's distributor Paramount Pictures</a> to obscure or remove the Budweiser logo from the film. </p> <p>Flight premiered Friday and Anheuser-Busch said the film didn't ask for permission to use Budweiser in the film, though it's not really protected by trademark law.</p> <p>The alcoholic Whitaker also drinks vodka often in the film though his tastes stretch across several brands, including Stolichnaya. The vodka's distributor said they didn't license the brand for the film and wouldn't have given permission to include it in the film if they had been consulted. </p> <p>Product placement can be insultingly overt in some films, but with instances like Flight, it can have the opposite effect of promoting a product.

  "<p>Britain's biggest arms companies collaborated secretly with ministers, Whitehall officials and the CIA to find a way of 'stifling' the Saudi opposition leader, Mohammed al-Mas'ari, according to a confidential report by the chief executive of the defence firm, Vickers, which has been leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>The internal Vickers memorandum, written by Sir Colin Chandler - formerly head of arms exports at the Ministry of Defence - provides an extraordinary insight into the relationship between government and the defence industry and their common determination to neutralise the threat to multi-billion pound contracts posed by the presence of Saudi dissidents in London.</p> <p>The memo, dated last September 6, reveals that Britain passed to Saudi Arabia secret intelligence on Saddam Hussein to appease Saudi anger over Mr Mas'ari's activities in London. The document also refers to 'direct Saudi intervention' against the prominent Saudi dissident, now threatened with deportation to Dominica, and attempts to 'stifle him personally'.</p> <p>In a three-page note to David Hastie - Vickers's international relations director and another former MoD official - Sir Colin describes a discussion with Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace, who reported anxiety in the CIA 'and their counterparts in this country' about the impact of Mr Mas'ari's campaign against the Saudi royal family and the presence of Western troops in the kingdom.</p> <p>Yesterday Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, declared that the rights of political refugees had to be weighed against British economic interests. Speaking in Delhi, he said not to have taken action against Mr Mas'ari would have been detrimental to Britain and would have cost jobs.</p> <p>As well as the exchanges with Mr Evans and Mike Rouse of British Aerospace, the Vickers memo refers to contacts with Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, over the Mas'ari case. Based on the al-Yamamah deal signed by Margaret Thatcher in the mid-1980s, all three firms depend on huge Saudi deals or hope to secure them soon.</p> <p>Vickers, British Aerospace, GKN and VSEL are negotiating aeronautical or defence sales worth pounds 3 billion.</p> <p>Highlighting the symbiotic relationship between the arms firms and various branches of government, the Vickers memo records Sir Colin and BAe's chief executive proposing jointly that the Government try to 'offset some of the Saudi criticism of us' by inviting President Saddam's son-in-law - who defected to Jordan last August - to Britain and then 'feeding some of the intelligence back to the kingdom'.</p> <p>Sir Colin was later telephoned by Andrew Green - recently appointed ambassador to Saudi Arabia - who told him that a British debriefing had already taken place in Amman and 'material had been passed to both King Fahd and the Saudi foreign minister'. This had 'earned us many plaudits'.</p> <p>It emerged last night that Mr Green has been a non-executive director of Vickers since April 1994. He joined the company in a Whitehall scheme designed to improve links with industry, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said.</p> <p>She added: 'There's no conflict of interest. It's a very logical choice that Mr Green should be appointed ambassador to Riyadh and advise Vickers.</p> <p>'Vickers is a company that is interested in that part of the world. That does not suggest anything improper.'</p> <p>The Vickers memo shows the British arms manufacturers are closely involved in Saudi palace intrigue, backing Prince Sultan, who Sir Colin makes clear is regarded as crucial to their contracts.</p> <p>Sir Colin records a 'general feeling' in intelligence and business circles that 'direct Saudi intervention' against Mr Mas'ari 'could be difficult because he is, as you probably know, the son of a leading cleric' in the kingdom.</p> <p>Last night Vickers refused to comment on the contents of Sir Colin's memorandum. A Foreign Office spokesman said it could make no comment 'on what appears to be leaked information'.</p> <h2>The Vickers memorandum, written by Sir Colin Chandler </h2> <p>To: Mr J. D. Hastie</p> <p>From: Sir Colin Chandler</p> <p>cc: Mr J. A. Crowther</p> <p>Float</p> <p>David,</p> <p>MOHAMMED AL-MAS'ARI</p> <p>Bearing in mind the importance of Saudi Arabia to British Aerospace, I had a word with Dick Evans on the telephone about this dissident, on 31st August. What Dick told me was rather interesting, and shed some new light on facets of this problem that perhaps we had not known before.</p> <p>It appears that King Fahd had for a time not been altogether unhappy about the activities of al-Mas'ari (spelt Al-Misari thoughout the memorandum). Most of the dissidents' attacks have been directed at Prince Sultan and, as you know, the relationship between the two brothers is not always a happy one. The king has therefore enjoyed a certain amount of schadenfreude at his brother's discomfort. But even the king recognises that this cannot go on much longer, particularly because the content of recent messages from al-Mas'ari has become much more serious.</p> <p>Apparently, some of the recent messages directed at the religious community have attempted to incite the mullahs to criticise the royal family, even to suggest that they should stir up the people of Saudi Arabia against the family, ie. try to provoke them into a coup. That particular aspect has, of course, got King Fahd worried. In addition, other members of the family have been annoyed that the king has taken no action to date and has appeared disinterested. In any event, and despite the king's apparent disdain, we all recognise the importance of Prince Sultan in the defence deal and the actions that have been taken by British Aerospace have been mainly to try and calm the local situation by playing down the importance of our al-Mas'ari.</p> <p>Another more disturbing turn recently has been that the dissidents' messages have also tried to stir the local populace and religious community against expatriates working in the kingdom. These have been mainly directed at the Americans but more recently have also been directed at the British. This starts to bring al-Mas'ari's activities into an area where some action might be taken. This is because these recent activities could be tantamount to inciting a form of terrorism and certainly the US authorities, and in particular the CIA, have become much more interested and, according to Dick, are in some dialogue with their counterparts in this country. As you can imagine Evans said that he was in close contact with his 'friend' in the United States on this subject.</p> <p>There was a general feeling that al-Mas'ari will win his appeal when it comes up in February or so next year and, in any event, direct Saudi intervention against him could be difficult because he is, as you probably know, the son of a leading cleric in the kingdom.</p> <p>Turning to a point which I had never heard before, the taking of action against him actually sending messages is currently virtually impossible because he is accessing the internet, occasionally through the United States, but also through other countries. There is, as yet, no international law which can deal with messages sent on the internet because it is almost impossible to trace the country of origin. Dick went on to add that Mick Rouse and BAe security people were constantly examining the problem to see if solutions could be found.</p> <p>He liked my suggestion that HMG might try to offset some of the Saudi criticism of us by inviting Saddam Hussein's son-in-law to visit the UK for an intelligence debrief and then feeding some of that intelligence back to the kingdom. Dick said he would join in supporting it with the Foreign Office.</p> <p>Andrew Green subsequently telephoned to say that British debriefing had been carried out in Amman and material had been passed to both King Fahd and the Saudi foreign minister. This had earned us many plaudits.</p> <p>Incidentally, Andrew's appointment as HMA Riyadh is not yet official. The Queen has not formally approved it and the Saudis have yet to give 'agreement'. If, as expected, the approvals are obtained, he would take up the post in March 1996.</p> <p>Since I dictated this note I had a conversation with Sir David Lees on this subject and another one with Mike Rouse. David Lees is of the mind to write to Michael Heseltine, just as I did. He also suggested that he, Dick Evans and I meet to discuss the subject which I am very happy to go along with.</p> <p>Mike Rouse took a more relaxed attitude about the activities of al-Mas'ari, saying that in his view some of Mas'ari's outbursts were becoming so outrageous that even the Saudis were not taking him very seriously. We all recognise that Prince Sultan may choose to take a different view completely but in Mike's view we should not do much now to let Mas'ari feel that he is important. It is something of a question of giving him enough rope . . . etc. In any event, Mike added, there are plenty of other people in Mas'ari's organisation who would soon take his place should an attempt be made to stifle him personally.</p> <p>I told Mike about the suggestion from David Lees about a meeting, he thought that was a good idea and will prepare a brief for Dick ready for that event.</p> <p>Colin</p>",
  "<p>The veteran firearms officer who shot and killed Azelle Rodney in April 2005 denied that he was \"trigger happy\" after it emerged he had shot two men dead in the 1980s and injured two others while on duty.</p> <p>Amid angry scenes at an inquiry into the death of Rodney the officer, known only as E7, said claims a gun had been planted in Rodney's car were outrageous. But he accepted that forensic evidence contradicted a key part of his justification for firing shots at a man he killed.</p> <p>Rodney was struck by six bullets, fired by E7, after a car he was travelling in was forced by police to stop in Edgware, north London. Officers had intelligence that Rodney was part of a gang on its way, possibly armed with automatic weapons, to attack and rip off a rival drugs gang. Weapons were recovered from the vehicle.</p> <p>Officers in unmarked cars followed the Volkswagen Golf Rodney, 24, and two others were in, before deciding to force it to stop. E7 was in a car that pulled up alongside the VW Golf with Mr Rodney sat in the back seat. E7 said Rodney's movements and body language, including ducking down and coming back up again, left him convinced he had to open fire.</p> <p>He told the inquiry he believed Rodney had ducked down to grab a weapon. The officer said he could not wait or shout a warning because the weapon he feared the suspect may have could fire 18 shots in a second: \"In half a second he could have nine rounds in the air.\"</p> <p>E7's first shot to strike Rodney, in the arm, was not fatal. He said he continued to fire, as the suspect remained upright and there was no obvious sign the shot had had any effect. But under questioning from Leslie Thomas for Rodney's family, E7 accepted forensic evidence that the suspect was falling when shot again. Video of the shooting shows E7 firing eight shots in just over a second. Two missed, one almost hitting another officer.</p> <p>E7 said he accepted he had to justify in law every shot he fired. Pressed on why he continued to fire, E7 said the suspect posed a threat because he was still upright.</p> <p>Thomas said forensic evidence showed the shot had been fired at a downwards angle, meaning E7's account was not correct: \"He could not have been upright when you fired shot number two.\"</p> <p>E7 said his \"perception\" was that Rodney was upright and added: \"I am prepared to accept, in the light of the forensics, he was falling into my shots.\" That second shot to strike the suspect was in the back, the third and fourth to the right ear region. The final two shots were to the top of Rodney's head.</p> <p>E7 denied firing indiscriminately. In an interview with the Independent Police Complaints Commission he refused to answer 149 questions, but denied at the inquiry believing he was above the law.</p> <p>E7 described as \"outrageous\" and \"insulting\" claims that E7's colleagues had planted a gun when it turned out the officers belief that Rodney had been holding a gun was mistaken.</p> <p>Thomas said: \"We say that the gun that was found subsequently on the back seat of the car was put there, removed from one of the bags in the car, it was not next to Mr Rodney.\"</p> <p>\"No sir it's not true,\" E7 replied.</p> <p>E7 said he opened fire fearing the suspect had a machine gun capable of firing one thousand rounds a minute and that the lives of his fellow officers were in danger.</p> <p>The mother of the dead man, Susan Alexander, interrupted E7's evidence. As the officer detailed the shooting he stopped and appeared to need to compose himself and Alexander called out: \"How many lies are you going to tell?\" She then left the inquiry chamber.</p> <p>E7 was inches from Rodney when he opened fire: \"His posture was one of someone preparing to fire a weapon,\" the officer said.</p> <p>E7 said he did not see a weapon in Rodney's hands before opening fire but still believes he had one.</p> <p>The inquiry heard that E7 had over two decades' experience as a firearms expert receiving commendations for his bravery, but he had been recommended for disciplinary action once for leaving his vehicle while on duty and arrested after a drunken fracas in a central London nightclub. He was not charged. In the 1980s he had shot two men dead in an operation and had wounded two other suspects.</p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>I have yet to understand the fascination of the Guardian with the minutiae of US presidential elections. Obama was elected as the candidate of change. He promised to get rid of Guant\u00e1namo, introduce a comprehensive national health service, and establish a new relationship in the Middle East and in America's informal empire. Instead Guant\u00e1namo and the dark prisons still function, healthcare is still under the control of the same companies, relationships with the Gulf autocracies are unchanged, along with support for Israel's every move, and drone wars that are an affront to international law are bringing terror to Pakistan and the Horn of Africa. Time was when, at least domestically, there was some major difference of principle between the two major US parties, be it the question of civil rights (Kennedy v Nixon) or the Big Society (Johnson v Goldwater). Elections in which, whoever wins, nothing is guaranteed to change are the ultimate in capitalist democracy. We are fast moving to a similar situation in Britain.

I still don't know who the candidates are, although I rang the helpline at least three weeks ago asking for details. I was invited to do this by an \"information\" leaflet posted to me. It did say I will have a first and second choice. No mention, though, of how the voting system works. What if there are more than two candidates? And what exactly is it all for anyway? The county police authorities, made up of elected local authority members, are being disbanded. Their job was to monitor the local police force, set the budget and, if necessary, sack the chief constable. In the future, elected local authority members will sit on a \"police and crime panel\" to monitor the new commissioner. If the panel doesn't like what the commissioner does, it will have a veto, including of his or her choice of a chief constable. So what's the point of having a commissioner, who will take a high salary, no doubt with expenses. What was that about fooling the people\u2026<br><strong>Penny Young</strong><br><em>South Lopham, Norfolk</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008John Harris mentions that in order to cut costs in the forthcoming police elections, the Conservatives who dreamt this up decided there would be no free mailshots for candidates. As a result, most people are barely aware that anything is happening. Not so in Cheshire. There are five candidates standing, including an independent, all having had to put up a \u00a35,000 deposit. However, Stephen Mosley, MP for Chester, has used his position, which allows him to have a column in the local free newspaper, to name, support and extol the virtues of the Conservative party candidate. So much for democracy and fairness between candidates.<br><strong>Phil Tate</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Please, John Harris, don't spoil your vote in the police commissioner election. In Avon and Somerset, there is a real danger that a dangerous candidate could be elected. The Conservative Ken Maddock was until recently leader of Somerset county council, where he pursued an ideologically driven policy of cuts and outsourcing. His administration's brutal plans for our libraries had national attention, but there has been much more on the same lines. Maddock's election material may be bland. But his underlying beliefs are sincere and we could expect cuts and privatisation in the police service if he were to win. We're told the turnout will be low, so every vote will count.

They may not be taking the election seriously in his neck of the woods, but in my area the candidates have been on television and had debates around West Yorkshire. I have helped deliver several thousand leaflets to homes in Bradford East to support the Labour candidate, who happens to be a serving councillor in Castleford, as well as being the current chair of the West Yorkshire Police Authority. Who could have more legitimacy than that?</p> <p>The Labour party does not agree with police commissioners, but it had to put up a candidate when the legislation passed through parliament. I believe that every election gives voters the opportunity to voice their opinions of the current administration, and the election of Labour police commissioners would send a message loud and clear to this useless coalition. To deliberately spoil your ballot paper is vainglorious and arrogant; it achieves nothing. The Guardian did not back the Labour party at the last election and look what we ended up with.

The coalition's enthusiasm for police commissioners is nothing to do with local democracy or public involvement but, once again, the golden rules of the market, ideology and \"follow the money\". Commissioners will control police budgets to enable them to force through \"modernisation\" of the police service and the handover of police tasks to the private sector for profit \"to reduce costs\". Just think of the potential&#xa0;revenues from traffic policing alone \u2013 profits backed by the force of law. Another splendid example of the needs of society and citizens being ignored to promote ideology and profits, disguised as progress.<br><strong>Peter North</strong><br><em>Brinton, Norfolk</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Thanks to John Harris. His article confirms our decision to spoil our ballot papers because of a lack of clear argument of why the existing police authorities are ineffective and incapable of being reformed and justify replacement by what is likely to become a political office.

  "<p>Argentina is braced for a wave of protests against the government of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, amid growing disquiet over a faltering economy and efforts to clamp down on the media.</p> <p>Activists hope to rally thousands of people on Thursday for a string of demonstrations against a proposed constitutional reform that would allow Fern\u00e1ndez to seek a third term in 2015, and a move to break up the country's main media group.</p> <p>In the five years since Fern\u00e1ndez succeeded her husband N\u00e9stor Kirchner in office, Argentina has grown increasingly polarised between those who argue the president's reforms will create a more egalitarian society, and opponents who accuse her creeping authoritarianism.</p> <p>\"A wide gulf has opened,\" said Jorge Lanata, the chain-smoking journalist whose weekly satirical TV show Periodismo Para Todos (Journalism For All) has helped shift the balance of public opinion.</p> <p>\"On one side you have the government and its supporters who are convinced they are carrying out a revolution \u2013 and it's logical that you shouldn't respect freedom of the press or the constitution if you're engaged in a revolution,\" said Lanata. \"On the other are the people who defend democracy, who are horrified at seeing freedom of the press and the Constitution attacked.\"</p> <p>With Fern\u00e1ndez's political rivals in disarray, the role of the opposition has been taken up by journalists such as Lanata and internet-based activists, such as</p> <p>Mariana Torres, a 41-year-old divorced mother of three who runs one of the main <a href=\"http://facebook.com/pages/EL-ANTI-K/156333624406111\" title=\"\">Facebook pages</a> behind the anti-government protests. \"I started navigating the internet looking for a job when my marriage broke up,\" she says. \"That's when I discovered the Facebook pages that criticize the government.\"</p> <p>Torres's Facebook group and others like it helped muster thousands of saucepan-banging protesters who took to the streets on 13 September after the government's ban on buying dollars \u2013 a move that sparked fury in a nation where US banknotes have long been a safeguard against the fluctuating exchange rates.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez's supporters say the protests are the result of a far-right conspiracy, a charge denied by Torres's fellow Facebook administrator, Marcelo Mor\u00e1n. Although there are a large number of similar anonymously-run pages, Torres and Mor\u00e1n stand out because they have decided to show their faces.</p> <p>\"We do not represent any political party,\" he said. \"On the contrary, we are just as worried about the opposition politicians.\"</p> <p>Lanata admits his programme, which combines hard-hitting reports on corruption with comedy sketches featuring mocking Fern\u00e1ndez and Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has been a catalyst for dissent. \"In my first programme I said I hoped we could learn to lose our fear, and that seems to have happened: people are now willing to speak out against this government.\"</p> <p>But to the president's supporters Lanata represents the kind of corporate media whose power President Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner has vowed to rein in.</p> <p>\"There is a sector that historically and since the beginning of this government has opposed projects of social inclusion, justice and distribution,\" said the cabinet chief, Juan Manuel Abal Medina after a nationwide rally against constitutional reform in September.</p> <p>\"Those sectors in the past resorted to coup d'\u00e9tats, today they resort to the big media. They are privileged classes who seek to keep their privileges.\"</p> <p>Lanata's show is broadcast on Channel 13, part of the country's largest media conglomerate, which also publishes Argentina's largest newspaper, Clar\u00edn. The group is widely perceived to be the target of a new media law which comes into effect on 7 December, forcing it to sell off its non-print holdings including the largest cable and internet operator in Argentina \u2013 and its main income earner, and possibly the Channel 13.</p> <p>The slogan \"Clar\u00edn Lies\" is printed on banners hanging from government buildings and was emblazoned on the T-shirt of during last year's election campaign.</p> <p>At Clar\u00edn itself the atmosphere is tense. \"We don't know exactly what will happen,\" says managing editor Ricardo Kirschbaum. \"There are rumours the government plans to take over Cablevision that day, which undoubtedly would affect us at the newspaper.\"</p>",

A ballot is the nearest a secular society gets to a sacred ritual, the voting booth its altar. Don't knock it. We may need it one day.</p> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, revealed on the radio today the ideological hole at the centre of her brain. She <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/06/police-commissioner-elections-turnout\" title=\"\">argued the virtue of elected police commissioners</a> from the example of Boris Johnson, mayor of London. Johnson has been a poor so-called \"commissioner\", leaving Britain's most flatulent gendarmerie inefficient and unreformed. But he is a public figure with a democratic base strong enough <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/03/boris.london\" title=\"\">to sack his police chief</a>, Sir Ian Blair, in 2008.</p> <p>What May did not point out is that Johnson was not an elected police commissioner but an elected mayor. He has a deeper mandate than any of next week's commissioners. This year he enjoyed a plausible turnout of 38%, while they will be lucky to hit double figures. Last year the Tories allowed big cities to vote on whether they too wanted an elected mayor. Most said no. But why was the same option not offered for police commissioners? Why should this one service have direct democracy rammed down the public throat and not the rest?</p> <p>No Tory to whom I have put this question can answer it. They mutter about David Cameron's localism being two committees short of a council, nothing joined up, no coherence. But there is talk that Cameron may indeed force municipalities to do what they declined to do last year, and have mayoral elections after all. If this is so, and if the government ordains that elected mayors are their own police commissioners, what is the point of next week's elections? This looks to be another constitutional omnishambles.</p> <p>The truth is that Westminster's politicians are hopeless at updating democracy. They have no clue. We have already had the failure of House of Lords reform, the failure to change constituencies and the imbalance of MPs between England and the devolved assemblies. There have been two messes over \"functional\" democracy. The attempt to make regional offices answer to regional assemblies collapsed under John Prescott's abortive \"Your region, your choice\" initiative. Electors in the north-east voted it down by 78% to 22% in 2004.</p> <p>Then we had the much-vaunted NHS foundation elections, initiated by Alan Milburn in 2002, under his patronising \"<a href=\"http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/earned-autonomy-moves-nhs-away-from-whitehall/27308.article\" title=\"\">earned autonomy</a>\". Millions were spent on ignored ballots which degenerated into absurdity. Constituencies were divided between local, occupational and \"rest of England\". Almost no one voted and the foundations morphed into 141 boards with only \"registered trust members\" voting. They are de facto private associations, not necessarily the worse for that, but hardly accountable democracy.</p> <p>Most social associations tend to boast features that are mildly democratic, if little more than \"stakeholder consultation\". This applies not just to hospitals but to charities, schools, corporations, even universities. They are Edmund Burke's little platoons. Their vigour contrasts with Cameron's \"big society\", the operational word being big, and therefore empty of meaning.</p> <p>Attempts to reform British democracy, central and local, have failed because they are rarely sincere. Democracies with \"layered\" constitutions, such as France, Germany and the US, delegate not just power but electoral accountability. They trust local people to make their own decisions about who should govern them, and they accept the consequences, postcode lotteries and all.</p> <p>Westminster hates anything that costs it control. In recent history only two reforms have done so: devolution to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the direct election of a handful of city mayors. Credit goes to Tony Blair for both, though he privately regretted devolution to Scotland. The essence of both reforms was parliament's shifting of a critical mass of power, first over a range of local services and second of at least some true electoral accountability.</p> <p>No critical mass of power is being transferred next week. Directly elected mayors have not taken off in Britain, partly because they were given little responsibility, partly because most people seem relatively content with their local government. Where they are not content, as in Bristol and Doncaster, they have opted for an elected mayor.</p> <p>The same applies with the police. The people of England and Wales cannot know the character or competence of the candidates. Except with plebiscites, as over capital punishment or drug laws, voters choosing individuals must rely on party affiliation. They default to party allegiance, in effect handing power of choice to whoever nominates their candidate.</p> <p>This is not valueless. It is just a matter of trust. Nothing is more senseless than to complain that the commissioners will bring \"politics\" into policing. What is the point of them if not? Policing is crippled by national politics already. If&#xa0;it&#xa0;must have politics, let it be local. This argument reflects a strange political psychosis in Britain, a mistrust of the mechanisms of democracy. Whatever the reason \u2013 crooked MPs, bureaucratic councils, low-turnout elections \u2013 it is dangerous.</p> <p>I have no trouble with ramming politics down people's throats, in \"forcing the people to be free\", including making the vote as compulsory as jury service. The police need democratic oversight. They are one of the most closed, complex and costly of local services. It is right that they be brought closer to their frontline clients, operating priorities and all. What is not right is that such direct accountability is not extended to other local services such as education, childcare, planning or transport: in other words under an all-purposes mayor or county governor.</p> <p>Most grownup democracies regard such leadership as most accountable where it is embodied in one person, rather than expressed through the cabalism of party groups and shifting coalitions. Johnson and his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, have proved this in London. I know of few Londoners who would revert to the days of the London County Council or Greater London Council. Sooner or later elected mayors will come. The coalition should move swiftly to make them universal throughout local government \u2013 rendering the new commissioners obsolete.</p> <p>Meanwhile, vote. If we fail to use whatever ballots the Westminster elite from time to time permits, it may one day conclude that we don't need them at all.</p>",
  "<p>The 2012 campaign began before the campaign of 2008 had finished. In February of that year, while Barack Obama was still locked in an epic struggle for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romney summoned his closest allies to a Boston office to work out why his effort to be the Republicans' standard-bearer of 2008 had failed so badly. He handed out a memo he had written about himself, detailing his strengths and weaknesses, assessing his own defeated candidacy as if it were one of the businesses he once assessed as a hotshot management consultant. This was no mere exercise in navel-gazing. Romney was determined to learn the lessons of defeat in 2008 in order to win in 2012.</p> <p>Thus began a long march that ended today. The visible miles came last winter, when Romney trudged through the pig farms of Iowa and the snows of New Hampshire in his search for the Republican nomination. But that followed an invisible primary, an endless round of closed-door fundraisers to fill up a war-chest he hoped would scare off the most fearsome potential rivals.</p> <p>Whether money was the explanation or not, Romney was indeed rewarded by the decision of several big-beast Republicans not to challenge him for the nomination. The New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Indiana's Mitch Daniels and others, including Sarah Palin, skipped the race, leaving the path open for Romney.</p> <p>When ambitious politicians duck a presidential contest, that's usually because they suspect the incumbent will be too hard to dislodge. In the summer of 2011, that looked like the smart decision. For Obama had just done what George W Bush had failed to do: he had removed \u2013 killed \u2013 Osama bin Laden. Many Republicans concluded that, given the US economy was bound to at least slightly improve by November 2012, the scalp of Bin Laden made the president tough to beat.</p> <p>The course for Romney ran anything but smooth. Instead of warming to the former Massachusetts governor as the obvious choice \u2013 a successful businessman who looked like Hollywood's idea of a president \u2013 Republican primary voters seemed ready to fall in love with almost anyone but him. The field of rivals included outlandish characters who seemed absurd to outsiders: pizza magnate Herman Cain, evolution-denying congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, Texas governor Rick Perry, who could not remember which three government departments he planned to shut down. Former McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt said: \"The Republican primary resembled a reality-TV show. All these guys might as well have been living in a tree house with Simon Cowell.\"</p> <p>And yet each of those candidates enjoyed a moment in the sun, a surge in support that made them \u2013 rather than Romney \u2013 the frontrunner. It was as if Republicans were desperate to find someone else to nominate. Accordingly, former senator Rick Santorum and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich won enough states between them to ensure the primary race dragged on.</p> <p>That long, bruising primary battle cost Romney dear, and not just financially (it forced him to spend money defeating his fellow Republicans rather than saving it for the fight against Obama). The greater cost was political.</p> <p>It exposed the future Republican nominee to sustained attack from his own side. The notion of Romney as a ruthless plutocrat, coldly laying off American workers, did not come from the Democrat attack machine. Romney was not seen as embodying the 1% because of the Occupy movement. Rather, that portrait was drawn by Gingrich, who aired an extended commercial, \"When Mitt Romney came to Town\", that tore apart Romney's tenure at the helm of the private equity firm Bain &amp; Co. It depicted him as a corporate raider, willing to shutter factories and shatter working lives if it made him richer. That critique lingered all year, eagerly picked up and advanced by the Democrats. But it originated with the Republicans.</p> <p>Still, the damage of the primaries went deeper. To push aside Santorum, Bachmann and the others, Romney was obliged to adopt positions that would endear him to the Republican faithful \u2013 but which stored up trouble for later. So Romney reversed his previous support for abortion rights and gun control, called on undocumented migrants to \"self-deport\" and rebranded himself from a Massachusetts moderate, who as governor had passed healthcare reform, into the \"severe conservative\" who now promised to repeal \"Obamacare\".</p> <p>Those reverses left him doubly wounded. For one thing, he could now be slammed as a serial flip-flopper, just another politician who believed in nothing and would say whatever it took to be elected. For another, he had been boxed into a series of positions bound to alienate core blocs of the electorate that had long been tough for Republicans to reach \u2013 the young, Latinos and suburban women among them.</p> <p>Sure enough, through the summer months he was on the receiving end of an air assault from Obama, in the form of saturation TV ads in key states, which portrayed Romney as part boardroom vulture, part unprincipled phoney. Obama, who had faced no primary challenge of his own, had the money to do it \u2013 defining Romney before he had a chance to define himself.</p> <p>Yet Romney could not just blame Obama. Much of his trouble was of his own making. He helped colour in the cartoon of himself as an out-of-touch one percenter when he boasted that his wife had \"a couple of Cadillacs\" or when his tax returns \u2013 showing that he paid a meagre 14% \u2013 had to be dragged out of him. In July, he botched an overseas tour meant to boost his credentials as a potential world leader by offending America's most easily pleased ally, Britain, when he suggested the London Olympics could be a flop and by travelling to Jerusalem to offer his view that cultural inferiority might be the cause of Palestinian suffering.</p> <p>What should have been a moment to relaunch his candidacy and make Americans look at him anew \u2013 his party convention in Tampa in August \u2013 also had little effect. His speech was overshadowed by a moment of Dadaist theatre, as Clint Eastwood harangued an empty chair standing in for an imaginary Obama. Romney was on his way to becoming a joke figure.</p> <p>In September, he went from being ridiculed to being hated. A leaked video showed him addressing fellow millionaires at a fundraising event in May, where an unplugged Romney candidly wrote off 47% of the electorate as parasites, non-taxpaying dependents who would never vote Republican because they would not \"take responsibility for their own lives\". Even many on his own side believed it was an act of self-destruction so complete that no candidate could possibly survive it.</p> <p>But Romney had one more chance. The first TV debate in Denver on 3 October was, for many Americans, the first time they had paid close attention to the election. What they saw was an incumbent president who looked exhausted, listless and disengaged. With his head down, his answers sluggish, it seemed he either was too tired to be president or no longer really wanted the job.</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, was spirited and energetic. Above all, he came across as a human being rather than the caricature of Obama propaganda: all he had to do was not seem like a rapacious capitalist bloodsucker and, in an instant, he had broken the core message of the Obama campaign. The immediate bounce that Romney enjoyed in the polls suggested that a small chunk of the electorate, disenchanted with the president, had been waiting to see if the Republican was a plausible replacement. In Denver Romney crossed that threshold.</p> <p>That change revealed what had always been the structural reality of this race. By rights, it should always have been close. Here was an incumbent president who had struggled to lift his approval rating above 50%, who had seen the number of Americans saying the US was on the \"wrong track\" become a majority and, most crucially, had watched as the unemployment rate had remained stuck at 8% for almost his entire presidency, shifting below that figure only a matter of weeks ago. The last president to be re-elected with a jobless percentage that high was Franklin Roosevelt in 1940, in what were rather different circumstances.</p> <p>So the election should never have been a cakewalk for Obama. That it had seemed that way, until Denver, attested to the deeply flawed candidacy of Romney. By raising his game at that first debate, he restored politics to something like normal service.</p> <p>Obama conceded that he had messed up, joked that he had been napping in the first encounter and sharpened up for the next two, where he remained clear, focused and unafraid to confront his opponent: in Denver he had failed even to mention Romney's 47% remark. Now he made it his closing argument.</p> <p>But October was a tough month for the president. He was hobbled by accusations that he had bungled or even deceived the public over the September killing of four US diplomats in Benghazi, an issue unlikely to go away. Still the end of the month brought some unlikely and helpful allies.</p> <p>The first was a former nemesis, Bill Clinton, who in 2008 had dismissed Obama's presidential bid as a \"fairytale\". In the campaign's closing days, Obama let the man they call the big dog run \u2013 as the country's most beloved Democrat grew hoarse making the case for his successor. Obama didn't just exploit Clinton's ability to connect to the white, male blue-collar Americans who remain beyond the current president's reach \u2013 he all but ran on Clinton's record, arguing that \"We know my plan works because we've tried it,\" referring to Clinton's success in the 1990s.</p> <p>The second ally was a genuine surprise. Some pollsters doubt that Superstorm Sandy really made a big difference for Obama, noting that Romney's surge, \"Mittmentum\", had already stalled before the weather changed. But few deny that Obama benefited from the chance to be seen doing the job of president, while Romney was sidelined, and profited especially from the bearhug he received from the Republicans' rising star, Chris Christie. His gushing praise for Obama, and refusal to campaign at Romney's side in Pennsylvania, was precious validation for the president \u2013 and it came at just the right time.</p> <p>And so the two men duelled to the very last, Romney making two campaign convention-breaking stops on election day itself. The campaign had finished, but the politics is anything but over.</p>",

  "<p>An EU watchdog has failed to give the union's budget a clean bill of health, finding that almost 4% of allocated funds were wasted last year.</p> <p>A fortnight before what is shaping up to be one of the most bad-tempered summits in years, with David Cameron being denounced in Brussels for taking an \"extreme\" position on budget negotiations, the European court of auditors criticised the administration of the budget for the 18th year in a row.</p> <p>V\u00edtor Caldeira, president of the court of auditors, which examines the EU books every year, said the message was \"consistent with previous years, but this year it matters more than ever\". He added: \"With Europe's public finances under severe pressure, there remains scope to spend EU money more efficiently and in a better-targeted manner.\"</p> <p>The court found \"an estimated error rate\" of 3.9% was found in payments from the \u20ac130bn budget to the 27 member states in 2011, slightly up from the waste identified for the previous year.</p> <p>The overall criticism of the administration of the budget was in line with the verdict delivered annually for many years, in what has become a Brussels ritual.</p> <p>But with positions hardening over a mega-bout of haggling over the new trillion-euro budget for the seven-year period from 2014-2020, the timing of Tuesday's verdict was sensitive.</p> <p>The British government embraced the auditors' verdict in an attempt to bolster its hardline stance ahead of the summit, arguing that the report was highly damaging to the \"credibility\" of how the EU budget was run.</p> <p>\"For the 18th consecutive year, the European court of auditors has not been able to give a positive statement of assurance, which seriously undermines the credibility of the EU's financial management,\" said a government spokesman.</p> <p>\"At a time when public spending is tight across Europe, we all need to have confidence that EU spending is being implemented as effectively as possible \u2026 the government will continue to press for urgent improvements to the way EU spending is managed.\"</p> <p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, reportedly angered by Cameron's stance on the seven-year budget, is to go to Downing Street on Wednesday evening to try to talk the prime minister into showing some flexibility at the summit in a fortnight.</p> <p>Cameron's position \u2013 insisting on retaining the full UK rebate while demanding a freeze on the seven-year kitty at last year's levels and threatening to wield a veto to get his way \u2013 ran into even greater problems last week when Labour joined Tory rebels in the House of Commons and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/cameron-commons-defeat-eu-budget\" title=\"\">defeated the government by calling for even deeper cuts</a> in EU spending.</p> <p>Diplomats in Brussels involved in the manoeuvring before the summit expect the scheduled two days to run into at least three days and nights, with the odds against securing an agreement, meaning that the leaders will have to return to the fraught topic early next year.</p> <p>Apart from Britain, Denmark and France have also been talking of vetoing a deal unless their priorities are met, while Hungary, which would be one of the big losers under plans by the bigger, richer countries to chop more than \u20ac100bn off the total proposed by the European commission, could also balk.</p> <p>While the commission administers the budget, most payments are made to member states which then oversee the use of the money. Caldeira reserved his main criticism not for Brussels, but for the national governments.</p> <p>\"We found the member states are not doing their job as fully as they should.

  "<p>Editors are concerned about the idea of a statute. Lord Justice Leveson has not reported yet, but from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/leveson-inquiry-prejudging-the-judge\" title=\"\">the Guardian</a> to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9637499/Statute-of-any-kind-spells-the-end-of-a-free-press.html\" title=\"\">the Telegraph</a> by way of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2223348/Britains-vibrant-Press-curbed-says-Boris-Top-Tories-warn-PM-state-regulation.html\" title=\"\">the Mail</a> there is concern he may propose a regulator for the press that is backed by legislation. This, it is argued, would by its very nature be bad for press freedom.</p> <p>Why? There is the Rubicon argument: we may adopt an innocent-looking law now, but who is to say that in future less tolerant rulers won't exploit it to gag the press? And there is the licensing argument: if a statute made newspapers participate in a regulatory system, that would amount to licensing of the press, something not seen in centuries. Neither argument survives much scrutiny.</p> <p>Let's say we had a law creating a regulator, at arm's length from government and the industry, able to conduct investigations and impose fines. Would that in itself deal a blow to press freedom?</p> <p>It is hard to see how. For a start, the industry can't object to regulation on principle because it has been insisting for 20 years that it had an effective regulator in the Press Complaints Commission (though it didn't). Second, there are decent arguments to suggest that statute is the best way to ensure a regulator has teeth and can be effective.</p> <p>Let's say next that 15 years from now we have an authoritarian government, seeking to control the press. Our regulator, under statute, is independent, so it has protection. For it to cease to be independent the statute would have to be changed through new legislation.</p> <p>In other words, a future government seeking censorship powers would be in the same position with or without a regulation law: it would need to get a bill through parliament. And it's worth remembering that if we end up with an authoritarian government our problem will be precisely that: an authoritarian government. Whether there is a regulation law it might want to tinker with will be way down the scale of worries.</p> <p>What if the new, post-Leveson law included a clause requiring all the big newspaper publishers (those with revenues exceeding, say, \u00a350m) to participate in the new regulatory regime? Would that amount to licensing?</p> <p>It is certainly a cherished principle that anyone can publish a newspaper if they can afford to, and that anyone who can find a place to publish may be a journalist. A requirement for large corporations to participate in an independent regulator is hardly in conflict with that. Indeed, in many industries participation in regulation is taken for granted as being for the public good. Nor would it be the first time that newspaper publishers were bound by statute: they must register with the tax authorities (newspapers are exempt from VAT); they can be sued for libel; they can be prosecuted for contempt of court or for breaking the Data Protection Act. They don't opt out of these laws and they shouldn't be able to opt out of independent regulation.</p> <p>But this is a perverse way of looking at things. The Rubicon and licensing arguments summon up unlikely and almost abstract hypotheses when we have before us a real, enduring press crisis that has been poisoning public life.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry\" title=\"\">Leveson inquiry</a> heard of industrial-scale privacy intrusion, serial libel, relentless dishonesty and unethical conduct, some of it reaching into our politics and policing. Many vulnerable people have been harmed, from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/17/hillsborough-families-seek-new-inquest\" title=\"\">Hillsborough families</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/04/milly-dowler-voicemail-hacked-news-of-world\" title=\"\">Dowlers</a>, and it happened because rich, powerful newspapers have been unaccountable.</p> <p>We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle this and it can be done without impinging on press freedom. The judge's terms of reference actually require him to ensure his recommendations support press freedom, and at his hearings no voice was raised for state control of the press. It would be astonishing if he made a recommendation that impinged on the ability of journalists to report matters of public interest, however unwelcome to government and vested interests.</p> <p>Our judges, appointed under statute, remain independent. Broadcast journalism, regulated under statute, is both trusted by the public and, in the case of the BBC, routinely hated by government. The National Union of Journalists believes that independent, accountable regulation will require statute. Polls show that three-quarters of the population feels the same way \u2013 because, it is plain, they believe nothing less will make a difference. If the judge recommends it, let it happen.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Harrison Birtwistle, composer</strong></h2> <p>I judge a lot of music by asking: \"Would I like to have written it?\" And with my favourite Carter pieces, I certainly would. I love the Double Concerto for piano, harpsichord and two chamber orchestras. There's nothing like it in music: the concept, the way it makes time and rhythm move, the instrumentation \u2013 that bloody harpsichord! Whether it's playable or not, I'm not sure, because it's so difficult. Along with Pierre Boulez's Le Marteau Sans Ma\u00eetre, the Double Concerto is one of the unique signposts of the 20th century.</p> <p>For me, Carter is a symbol of what it means to be a committed artist. He made no compromises, no concessions to public taste. Although he took on the accoutrements of European new music and of serialism, his was a true American voice, much like that of his contemporaries, John Cage and Morton Feldman. They were all uniquely American, rather like the abstract expressionist painters.</p> <p>I last saw him at the Aldeburgh festival in 2009, when I wrote my music-theatre piece The Corridor. He&#xa0;had a new piece, too, and came to my concert. I remember we went to a restaurant with a lot of people, and everyone had to leave for a concert. He&#xa0;said, \"Can't we just stay here?\", which I thought was rather sweet. I&#xa0;said I would stay with him, but then, like a couple of reluctant schoolboys, we had to go to this concert. Neither of us had a piece in it, and I'd gladly have sat with him. I'm sorry about that&#xa0;moment.</p> <h2><strong>John Tavener, composer</strong></h2> <p>Carter transformed all notions of modernism by writing music that seemed to erupt from his very being. He was, for me, the greatest American composer that has ever lived. I have always held him in awe, but only recently, since I was seriously ill, have I come to understand his real stature. I think he did something no other modernist has ever achieved. He, in the last 10 years of his life, seemed to rid modernism of all its angst, creating sparkling edifices of joy and beauty, like the Flute Concerto and Dialogues for Piano and Chamber Orchestra. From a composer's point of view, he was an absolute master \u2013 and he did it better than any of us.</p> <h2><strong>Daniel Barenboim, conductor</strong></h2> <p>I have loved Elliott Carter's music for many years. Last month, I recorded his cello concerto, and I was speaking to him only last Saturday. For me, he was the most important American composer of his time. His music was not complicated, but it was complex. I&#xa0;think its outstanding quality was that it always seemed to be in good humour. If Haydn had lived in the 21st century, he would have probably have composed like this.</p> <p>When you get to be 103, modernism is a very wide concept. In some aspects he was ahead of his times, but then some of his music doesn't sound like music of the future \u2013 but it is unmistakable and I simply love it. The problem with listening to music today is that there's so much of it everywhere. We've got used to hearing music without actually listening to it. Carter's is to be listened to.</p> <p>He had the most extraordinary memory. He remembered what happened last week, last year, and 90 years ago. In fact, when he was in his 90s, I performed his music in Chicago. He told me about his first visit to Berlin when he was 14, in 1922. He said he'd heard the last concerts conducted by&#xa0;Arthur Nikisch at the Berlin Philharmonic before Furtw\u00e4ngler took over \u2013 and he told me what he'd heard! I must say, I was a little suspicious and had the concert programmes checked. He was absolutely right.</p> <p><em>This is an edited transcript of an interview for Radio 3's In Tune.</em></p> <h2><strong>Alisa Weilerstein, cellist</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1stGn4NA-tU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1stGn4NA-tU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1stGn4NA-tU&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">I met him</a> on an incredibly hot day in New York last summer. He was affable and kind, and was using a giant magnifying glass to look at a score. When I asked if I could play a passage of his cello concerto, he said: \"Of course, but I don't hear so well.\" He lasted about seven seconds before he stopped me with incredibly detailed observations about my playing. He told me things about the work I'd never heard before, saying he'd wanted to make use of the cello's incredible expressive possibilities. \"I wanted it to sing,\" he said.</p> <p>In the fourth movement, he wanted my playing to be more expressive, which is something I'm rarely told. Usually people tell me to calm down! He composed every day, too. Even on that day, when it was over 40 degrees, he'd got up that morning to write.</p> <h2><strong>Oliver Knussen, composer</strong></h2> <p>The journey from a first glimpse of Carter, then 60, at a rehearsal for an early performance of the Piano Concerto in Chicago (I was too shy to say hello), to the experience of conducting it in his presence at the Barbican nearly 40 years later encloses a multitude of memories both personal - of Elliott and his devotion to his amazing and inimitable wife Helen, their kindness to my family and to me - and musical. I hope I have at least partly paid back, by playing and recording his music, what I took from him in order to make my own. To have been in on the conception and the first complete performances of the Symphonia, one of the true monuments of the fin-de-20th-si\u00e8cle, was one of the great honours of my life.</p> <h2><strong>George Benjamin, composer</strong></h2> <p>His angle on the world was original,&#xa0;bold and compelling. In&#xa0;his&#xa0;works, opposites combine and&#xa0;collide; the multiplicity of human experience is represented in music that's volatile, and full of ambiguity and contradiction. But it also abounds in a teeming sense of invention, bubbling with fantasy, while his sense of narrative structure \u2013 influenced as much by contemporary literature and cinema as music \u2013 was extraordinarily audacious and potent.</p> <p>These attributes are typified in his Concerto for Orchestra, premiered by the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein in 1970; one of the great orchestral works of recent decades, its exuberance and dramatic energy are uniquely thrilling. An extraordinary performance of this work, given by the London Sinfonietta under Oliver Knussen over 20 years ago, remains emblazoned on my memory.</p> <p>His individual style \u2013 which took an arduous and lonely struggle to come into focus \u2013 owed as much to the European postwar avant garde as it did to the American modernist tradition, though it is utterly and fundamentally the vision of an American. I first met him as a teenager, in the late 1970s, and remained in contact till recently. Courteous and warm, his exceptional intellect was balanced by an endearing, even impish, sense of humour. He shared an exceptionally happy married life, living for more than six decades with his wife, Helen, who seemed \u2013 on the surface \u2013 a somewhat waspish presence, though below was a heart of gold. Carter was a visionary and powerfully independent figure on the international music scene figure, and he will be deeply missed.</p> <h2><strong>Colin Currie, percussionist</strong></h2> <p>A few years ago, I asked Carter to write a work for solo piano, solo percussion and chamber orchestra. I'd noticed he'd always written inventively for percussion and had really been pushing the envelope. I thought that having those two sonorities \u2013 piano and percussion \u2013 in conversation would appeal to him.</p> <p>We had a meeting at his New York apartment, and he was brimming with curiosity about the idea. At first, I'd receive emails with, say, marimba phrases to check. Then he realised everything he was doing was working and he stopped checking in. His imagination was utterly undimmed, even in these last few years.</p> <p>The work was premiered as Conversations for Piano, Percussion and Chamber Ensemble at Aldeburgh in 2011. Having heard how good it sounded, Carter added two further movements, and it became the Double Concerto for percussion and piano. It was one of his very last large-scale works. We were lucky enough to premiere it to him in person in June in New York last year, with the New York Philharmonic. Afterwards, he wrote to me \u2013 a typically generous gesture \u2013 to say how much he'd enjoyed it, and that the piece worked better than he could have imagined.</p> <h2><strong>Paul Griffiths, librettist</strong></h2> <p>The boy who went to concerts with Charles Ives and heard the works of Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Debussy when they were new, has gone. A huge slab of musical time slides into the past. This was a composer whose music, through nine decades, exuded his personal qualities of respect for the past, allied with zest for the present. He was courteous and humorous, with an intelligent, well-stocked mind and a democratic spirit. His music may challenge by its complexity, but it will also charm with its beautifully turned lines, its conversations, its fine colours, its wit.</p> <p>Carter made history more than 60 years ago with a string quartet that treats the four instruments as individuals with their own states of mind, their own ways of moving, their own purposes \u2013 as characters in a drama. Half a century later, he decided he wanted to make his characters speak \u2013 or, rather, sing. He wanted to make an opera. It was my privilege to work with him on What Next?, and to discover a little of what made him tick creatively (most often at several different speeds simultaneously). At heart, perhaps, it was one simple notion: \"I want to have fun!\" That way he could be sure his listeners, in storms of brilliant detail, would, too.</p> <h2><strong>Nick Daniel, oboist</strong></h2> <p>It's a shock to the solar plexus to lose him. I played his Oboe Concerto many times, and he once remarked to me: \"I used to ask for it to be more controlled, more grey-coloured, but now I want it to just sing.\" This singing quality came out as he got older. His music isn't melodic in a conventional way, though, but in a way that uniquely fits the instruments or voice he's writing for.</p> <p>His is the kind of music that, at first,&#xa0;you think: \"How on earth am I going to do this?\" Some pieces remain difficult, but they become part of your blood, your DNA. He was absolutely delightful to work with \u2013 I don't know anyone who had a bad experience. Although he was tough, he was incredibly clear, always wanting his music to flow. He didn't want it to get stuck or feel sentimental.</p> <p>My fondest memory was playing his Oboe Quartet at Aldeburgh. He'd flown over, aged 101. The first half of the concert was before lunch, then there was a break to eat, and he decided to have oysters. So we had an extra long interval while we waited for him to finish his lunch. At the end, he stood up, and walked \u2013 unaided \u2013 from the back to the front of the church to thank us. I'll never forget it. He was glowing.</p> <h2><strong>Nic Hodges, pianist</strong></h2> <p>Like many people, I had begun to think that Elliott was immortal - or at least that he had somehow managed to cheat death especially since he carried on clocking up birthdays since his 100th. But reality has finally caught up with him. I was very lucky that I first met Elliott at a time and in a context when he was at ease. It was in 2000, just after the New York premiere of his opera, What Next?. By that time, he had already lived so long that he was free to do what he wanted muscially. He didn't need to prove anything to himself any more. The joie de vivre of his later pieces, their crystalline expressivity - like the piano concerto, Dialogues, that he wrote for me - is something that he earned through his understanding of his material, of his music. In the 50s and 60s, there was a major piece only every five years or so, because had to recreate his musical universe in each piece. That hard work in those decades gave him the technical freedom and fluency of his last decades.<br> The picture that was painted of him as being forbidding or irascible is not something that I ever saw. I will think of him with huge fondness, as someone who was very kind to me, who was always interested in me, my family, and my life. Sometimes, in later years, he would be tired and wouldn't seem so sharp, and then I 'd see him again and he would be sharper than I was. I loved our discussions: he told me how he page-turned for Bart\u00f3k, and that what Bart\u00f3k played bore very little relationship to what was on the page. Elliott was living history. And you know, the very last discussion we had was about the depiction of sex on stage!</p> <h2><strong>Paul Mealor, composer</strong></h2> <p>The world has lost one of its greatest original thinkers and most individual artistic voices. For me, the genius of Carter is most fully revealed in his string quartets - each one a study in clarity of both harmonic expression rhythmical invention. A truly remarkable composer. One of a kind. His insight into the human condition, through his music, will be deeply missed.</p> <h2><strong>Richard Rodney Bennett composer</strong></h2> <p>One can't imagine 20th century music without Elliott Carter.</p> <h2><strong>Roger Wright, controller BBC Radio 3/Director of the Proms</strong></h2> <p>He was a towering musical figure who leaves a powerful legacy through his own works and his significant influence on other composers. Radio 3 and the BBC Proms are proud to have commissioned his work, and Radio 3 will be marking his contribution to music this week.</p> <h2><strong>Pierre-Laurent Aimard, artistic director, Aldeburgh Festival</strong></h2> <p>Elliott Carter left us as we always knew him \u2013 peacefully and discreetly. We will always remember his smile, his joie de vivre and his sense of humour. He was and will remain a composer of fantasy and structure, reflective yet alive, always reinventing and yet true to himself. By turns lyrical, dramatic, complex, amusing and poetic, this grand master of polyphony understood the challenges of his time and entertained us with great intelligence.</p> <h2><strong>David Robertson, conductor</strong></h2> <p>I'd conducted his Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano in Paris back in 1992. He'd heard about it from New York, so I got up my courage to call him, and left him a message. He called back one evening. He said \"Hello this is Elliott Carter\" and I said \"oh my god I'm just brushing my teeth!\" and he said, quick as a flash, \"Well, wash your mouth out.\" That combination of a quick mind and a great sense of humour was something he revealed time and time again. Whenever I worked on his music I was always amazed at how much it parallels the way thought works in one's brain. Writers such as James Joyce or Virginia Woolf get close to it, but even the medium of print slows down the way ideas ricochet around your mind. Carter's music is full of life-like scenes. Lines criss-cross and come together again. It feels like what happens in your brain when you are thinking. His music has this quicksilver nature of being able to inhabit lots of different emotions one after the other.</p> <p>When you had a conversation with him, one of the things that struck you was that he had an incredibly good short-term memory - in terms of picking up things in the conversation earlier - but he also had an amazing long-term memory. I've often wondered if his unique creative longevity was partly due to this really fine combination of those two kinds of memories. Composers need both, and he kept his luminous musical intelligence right up to the end.</p> <p>I last saw him when he was made a Commadeur of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur back in September. He had prepared a speech but was so overcome by the honour that he suddenly just improvised a whole different, new speech in French, which was only one of many languages he spoke. His creativity was very inspiring. He didn't let himself be bound by anything. He showed composers the means of expressing themselves without ever being dogmatic. He never followed a system or a school, composing was more about exploring the possibilities of taking music anywhere you want it to go. He thought in a language of sound that was entirely his and entirely eloquent, and, aside from his music, that achievement is his legacy to us all.</p>",
  "<p>I am sitting at a bare table in a room with grey walls. Beyond is a large, gloomy office filled with desks and office clutter. Outside, the weak Danish sunshine struggles against the beginnings of relentless rain.</p> <p>The door bangs firmly shut, a recording device clunks into life and Copenhagen's most famous detective begins her interrogation \u2013 only this time Sarah Lund is answering the questions. Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l, the actor who plays her, sits on the wrong side of the table, a gregarious, engaging presence, and contemplates Lund's final exit from this police station.</p> <p>Filming on the third and last series of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/18/the-killing-series-three-review\" title=\"\">The Killing</a> finished a couple of days ago, and tomorrow the room in which we now sit will be pulled down, along with the rest of the set, with its familiar corridors and haphazard filing. (I have to clear a chair of police files to sit down.)</p> <p>Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l is finding this difficult to come to terms with. Admirers of the crime drama \u2013 which came to BBC4 early in 2011, with little fanfare, and then crept up the ratings to become a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/mar/04/the-killing-bbc-danish-crime-thriller?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">massive hit</a> \u2013 may also struggle to let go of Lund. She is a somewhat unlikely hero: uncommunicative, occasionally bungling, neglectful of close relationships and family life. But the detective's unshakeable commitment to finding Nanna Birk Larsen's killer over that first 20-hour season was matched only by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/nov/18/the-killing-2-sofie-grabol\" title=\"\">the fans' growing fervour for Lund</a> herself.</p> <p>And while plot is inevitably central to a drama that focuses relentlessly on a single crime, it has been Lund's gradual decline \u2013 personal and professional \u2013 that has made The Killing so gripping; even allowing for a second series that sometimes stretched the limits of plausibility. Lund will not be returning after this outing, Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l promises. \"I think there's a great beauty in ending a story,\" she says. \"It is finished now. I&#xa0;didn't have that feeling at the end of season two. This time, I feel there's definitely not going to be a fourth.\"</p> <p>She is clearly finding it difficult to say goodbye, and for a moment struggles to control her emotions. \"I feel like I've just stepped off a carousel, but the ground is still moving \u2013 so I'm not that formulated about how I feel,\" she says, tears threatening to spill down her cheeks. \"But the last day of shooting was much more emotional than I thought it would be; it was very intense. I had three big scenes, and it was like being in this hurricane. I said goodbye to everyone, went out into the parking lot, got in my car, slammed the door and then just totally broke down.\"</p> <p>Across the police station, in another dark, spare office, writer S\u00f8ren Sveistrup is also beginning to contemplate life without Lund \u2013 although, with episodes yet to edit, he has put such thoughts on hold for now. \"If you ask me around Christmas, I probably won't answer the phone, and will be crying,\" he admits, cheerfully. \"So it will be tough, but it has been my own decision to stop while the party is going.\"</p> <p>Sveistrup will not be talked into reconsidering: the drama was conceived as a trilogy, and has now <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNzhxoDl07k\" title=\"\">reached its conclusion</a>. There is more to this than the pressures of plotting and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/03/the-killing-sarah-lund\" title=\"\">strain of spending eight years on a project</a> (The Killing first aired in Denmark in early 2007, but was longer in the making). \"I&#xa0;want the last chapter to be as good as the others,\" he says. \"There's a lot of bad stuff on television, and I didn't want to become one of the shows that are not working.\"</p> <p>While never \"not working\", it's true that many British viewers found The Killing's second series less convincing than the first. In part, that may have been to do with expectation levels; perhaps Sarah Lund's jumper bobbing around Afghanistan was a leap too far. For the detective's final adventure, Sveistrup is returning to familiar themes: a mix of crime, politics and, crucially, family. At a preview screening, the scenes of police creeping intently through woodland closely echo that initial season.</p> <p>Sveistrup acknowledges that there was a necessary move back to basics after series two, but says that this wasn't a definite decision on his part \u2013 rather that he was conscious of repeating himself with the second series. \"This time I felt freer. It's been longer since I did the first series and I thought I could do whatever I wanted.\"</p> <p>The Killing is intensely personal for Sveistrup, who in person is easy-going and relaxed, but says he is working out his own neuroses with every episode. \"The Killing is always about loss. You can lose everything that has a value for you \u2013 your soul, really, if you compromise yourself. That's my own nightmare: just to wake up one day and discover it's all gone.\"</p> <p>Poor Lund, of course, has had to live out these nightmares. The Killing's strength is that the detective carries the weight of her experiences with her; in the new series, she is beginning to distance herself from work, attempting to have a private life, and is reticent about being drawn into a chase. In the opening episode, we see her preparing a dinner to be eaten from plates, rather than straight from the pan \u2013 a big shift. Lund is so reluctant to go into the field she has even taken to wearing heels. Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l reflects on these changes in her character. \"If you lose everything you invest, can you just put everything on the table again the next time? Like most of us when we get older, we tend to think, 'Let somebody else save the world.'\"</p> <p>Even for Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l, Lund remains a mystery. \"What amazes me is I've not lost interest after seven years, which is more than you can say about most marriages,\" she says. \"There's so much we don't know about her. In that sense, she isn't really mine \u2013 I don't know more about her than you do.\"</p> <p>The international success of the series has brought inevitable pressures. As Sveistrup was sitting down to write the final 10-part series, Britain was just getting around to awarding its first a Bafta. \"I couldn't make any decisions and I couldn't write, because I thought everybody would kill me if I got it wrong,\" he says. \"Then somebody said, 'And action!' and I thought 'OK, I've definitely got to hurry now!' And then I stopped thinking after that, and it was just my gut feeling. But of course, when you try to end the whole story, you feel a pressure: you want to make the best of it, and you'd hate the audience to be disappointed.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398926043\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/11/6/1352221881519/Sofie-Gr-b-l-as-Sarah-Lun-010.jpg\" alt=\"Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l as Sarah Lund\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Lund, in her new on-duty knitwear </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"At the start of the series I felt a bit, I&#xa0;won't say nervous, but tense,\" says Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l. \"It's special \u2013 it's not just like slipping into the old jumper and there it is.\" Speaking of <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-11-18/the-killing-knit-your-own-sarah-lund-jumper\" title=\"\">jumpers</a>, yes: there is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/sep/17/sarah-lund-jumper-final-killing\" title=\"\">new one</a> \u2013 navy with a white pattern. In the style of series two, we also get a pre-jumper jumper (main picture, with chevrons), which she wears before being lured back into detecting. Both times, Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l laughs, she and the producers tried to leave the detective's Faroese knitwear behind, but ended up putting Lund back in it.</p> <p>Nikolaj Lie Kaas, who takes on the hazardous role of Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l's new sidekick, tells me a funny story about his first day on set. \"I wondered if it was actually a parody \u2013 are we doing a spoof? Everyone was talking about 'the jumper' that hadn't arrived from the Faroe islands, and they were waiting for a plane, coming with it on it. Everything was chaos! I said, 'If I was to make fun of this series, this is the situation I would choose.'\"</p> <p>The actor is fun to be with: glamorous, charming, easy \u2013 all the things that Lund is not. But Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l also displays her character's single-mindedness when it comes to work: \"Our biggest fear has been to get into a routine. You don't want that. We're very ambitious about keeping ourselves creatively awake and not just reproducing ourselves. And that is the challenge when you're dealing with a project that you know so well. To keep it evolving and alive.\"Already, Scandinavian television has served up its Lund 2.0, in the shape of the socially awkward <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/may/12/bridge-sofia-helin-saga-interview\" title=\"\">Saga Nor\u00e9n</a>, one half of the Swedish/Danish crime partnership in the much-admired The Bridge. But The Killing team are largely diplomatic when quizzed about the similarities: Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l says she hasn't seen The Bridge; Sveistrup says the comparison is an honour. But the show's producer, Piv Bernth (now also head of drama at DR, the broadcaster that makes the show), takes a different tack. The immediate future isn't about more Sarah Lunds, she says: it's about her male equivalents. With Copenhagen on the map for TV (much to Bernth's delight: she trained in London with a director who always introduced her as&#xa0;\"from somewhere in fucking Scandinavia\"), this seems a distinctly egalitarian, Danish approach.</p> <p>\"I think maybe the time has come,\" Bernth says. \"We're trying to develop stories about male characters \u2013 what happened to the guys while women were out doing all these things, saving the world? They went back home and took care of all the kids and stuff, but what happened then?\" Danish TV has already explored some of this tension, in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/jan/14/borgen-danish-tv-thrillers\" title=\"\">Borgen</a>.</p> <p>In the meantime, Lund must step out once more. And while Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l's goodbye has been emotional, she admits she's glad in some ways. \"I&#xa0;feel&#xa0;a bit like it's a divorce, in the sense that it's a mix between great pain and great relief. It's the right decision to end it \u2013 you grieve, but you're also ready to move on.\"</p> <p>\u2022 The Killing III begins on 17 November on BBC4.</p>",
  "<p>It's finally here. Election day. By the end of the night, we'll most likely know who'll be running the country for the next four years. In the blue corner, Barack Obama, rapidly graying but game for another term. In the red corner, Mitt Romney, graying at the temples like a model in a Just For Men commercial and grabbing, desperately, at the job he's been interviewing for for the better part of a decade.</p> <p>Red or blue, regardless of who wins today, one thing is certain: it will take years of work to remedy the harm that has been done to reproductive freedom in the last two years. It will take more than the four years that President Obama would win; and should Romney win, it will take even longer.</p> <p>\"This is not the 1950s,\" <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/08/obama-campaign-airs-planned-parenthood-ad-this-is-131093.html\">argues one Obama ad</a>, warning about the Romney-Ryan positions on abortion, contraception, and Planned Parenthood. The reality is that, in many parts of the country, that time travel has already occurred, and without their help. In large swaths of the United States, abortion has become inaccessible to many women: too expensive, too time-consuming, too intimidating, too <em>hard</em> to access. </p> <p>A second term for Obama would, of course, be far better for American women than would a President Romney and Vice-President Ryan. Romney, after all, has pledged to cut all federal funding to Planned Parenthood on day one of his presidency. And Ryan, who has been far more consistent in his anti-choice policies, favours a national version of the controversial mandatory transvaginal ultrasound law currently in effect in Texas. The official GOP stance on abortion \u2013 the one in its party platform \u2013 is that all abortions should be illegal, with no exceptions in the case of rape. It also declares that constitutional rights ought to be granted at the moment of conception, taking a cue from the too-extreme-for-Mississippi law that would have banned the pill, the IUD, and in vitro fertilisation.</p> <p>A vote for Obama and the Democrats is a vote against that regressive platform and those \"pro-life\" policies that would let women die rather than allow them abortions. But an Obama win alone won't undo the stunning shifts that have occurred in both law and culture in the last few years. In 2011, state legislators proposed 1,100 reproductive rights-related measures, almost all of them aimed at restricting those rights. That was an increase from 2010's 950 measures. Last year, states enacted a record number of abortion restrictions, as <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2012/01/05/endofyear.html\">the vertiginous line on this graph demonstrates</a>.</p> <p>In addition to legislative changes, the last two years have seen a shift in the national discourse around reproductive rights, in which positions that were once considered extreme \u2013 removing rape and incest exceptions from abortion bans \u2013 became mainstream Republican positions. In the space of just a few years, America has become a country in which an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/31/planned-parenthood-bullying-cancer-charity\">organization dedicated to defeating breast cancer pulls funding</a> from clinics that provide breast cancer screenings in addition to abortions and STI tests, and where politicians with presidential aspirations discuss whether or not the birth control pill should be banned.</p> <p>To those unfamiliar with these issues, it may seem as though the right's fixation on rape, the pill, and ultrasounds has sprung out of nowhere. The truth is far more sobering. A generation ago, when my mother was a vocal young feminist, the pro-choice movement made slow advances towards decriminalising contraception and abortion \u2013 advances that culminated, of course, in the success of arguing a case before the US supreme court and securing 1973's historic Wade v Roe ruling. Similarly, the right's desire to throw up as many obstacles to abortion as possible \u2013 mandatory ultrasounds, waiting periods, higher costs, the impossible-to-meet requirements for clinics <a href=\"http://reproductiverights.org/en/project/targeted-regulation-of-abortion-providers-trap\">known as Trap laws</a> \u2013 has been brewing for some time. Nor did the desire to target hitherto uncontroversial forms of contraception like the pill and the IUD spring fully-formed into existence in 2011. Of course, it was largely thanks to GOP electoral victories, fueled by Tea Party enthusiasm and extremism, that those plans were finally turned into policy.</p> <p>Electoral advantages and groundwork aside, it's my belief that the misogynistic hostility towards women's bodily autonomy, the desire to turn back the clock on gender equality, is part of a reaction to the election of the nation's first African-American president. The sense that America has rolled dangerously far down an undesirable road has not only brought out the hideous racism that until now had mostly lain dormant and covert, but has also fed a desire to undo what the left sees as progress toward gender equality and what conservatives view as the dismantling of everything they hold dear. The re-election of President Obama will, in all likelihood, serve to deepen that sentiment on the right.</p> <p>This is not to argue against re-electing Obama: when you're pissing off America's racists and misogynists, it means you're doing something right. It is simply to warn that a win for Obama will mean a continuation, and even a worsening, of the cultural and legislative trends we've witnessed in the last few years.</p> <p>Regaining the ground lost, and bringing the national discourse back to where it was before this madness began, will take an enormous amount of hard work. It will also take time \u2013 far longer than the four years Obama would have in office. Yes, rights can be stripped away in one or two congressional sessions, but restoring them, and crawling out of this horrendous cultural quagmire, will take many more than that.</p> <p>A victory for Obama will shield America from a president and vice-president who will are eager to appoint anti-Roe justices, and who will be delighted to see abortion and contraception made inaccessible to even more American women.

  "<p>The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has ridden into the storm surrounding end-of-life care like a knight in shining armour. He wants a revamp of the NHS constitution to <a href=\"http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/at-a-glance/main-section/relatives-get-right-to-be-informed-of-pathway-to-death-decision-1-5093270\" title=\"\">defend patients from their doctors</a>, forcing the medical profession to speak to relatives before implementing the Liverpool Care Pathway (the LCP), which is widely used as a treatment tool in the last hours of the life of a dying patient. Hailed as a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2227089/Victory-care-pathway-families-Minister-pledges-new-law-patients-end-life-regime-consulting-relatives.html\" title=\"\">\"victory for families\"</a> by the Daily Mail, the changes will no doubt win some political points. But overall they are about as useful as offering a hedgehog a protective coat of spikes \u2013 it promises nothing that patients do not already have.</p> <p>Hunt's determination that patients' families should have a right to be involved in the care of their relatives is already <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/media/livacuk/mcpcil/migrated-files/liverpool-care-pathway/updatedlcppdfs/LCP_V12_Core_Documentation_FINAL_%28Example%29.pdf\" title=\"\">enshrined within the LCP</a> \u2013 excluding families is anathema to its very ethos. If this is not sufficient protection for patients (and I agree it may not be), then the General Medical Council document <a href=\"http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/relationships_with_patients_people.asp\" title=\"\">Duties of a Doctor</a> certainly does not lack teeth, and makes clear a doctor's obligations to families. Moreover, where a patient lacks capacity there is the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/protecting-the-vulnerable/mca/opg-603-0409.pdf\" title=\"\">Medical Capacity Act</a>, which again lays out the duty to involve families. The Mail states that, under the changes, doctors will be \"legally obliged to seek patients' consent before placing them on the LCP\", but this is meaningless: they are already obliged to seek consent for every treatment they instigate.</p> <p>As a GP, I have closely followed the sustained attack on the LCP \u2013 initially with horror, then with deep sadness and distress. It has been like watching the humiliation of an old friend. This is not because of some blind loyalty to the LCP itself, or an inability to accept that doctors can be criticised, but because, like the vast majority of healthcare professionals involved in end-of-life care, it is something I am deeply passionate about.</p> <p>Ensuring that those at the end of their life achieve a good death is one of the greatest challenges in medicine. Many times when I have driven to the house of a dying patient, or even more so to the children's hospice, every bone in my body has wanted to turn around and go home. It would be easier \u2013 the conversations and decisions you have to make are difficult and emotionally draining \u2013 but they are one of the most rewarding things I do.</p> <p>The LCP is not a ghoulish \"death pathway\" with sinister undertones, but a compassionate, carefully written document which helps doctors, patients and their families to make the right decisions near the end of life. It ensures that nothing is forgotten \u2013 like pressure areas, mouth care or the spiritual needs of the patient \u2013 and it encourages regular review. It is not an exact science, and clearly there have been serious problems in some cases. I am as disturbed as anybody when I hear that families have felt excluded from conversations concerning their loved ones. However, the sustained media campaign against the LCP has accused it of crimes it just has not committed.</p> <p>Time and again the charge is made that the LCP has been instigated <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2225080/District-nurse-90-year-old-father-Liverpool-Care-Pathway-home--consulting-family.html\" title=\"\">without the involvement of families</a>. But enshrined within the very fabric of the LCP is the involvement of relatives. Where relatives have felt excluded, we need to ask why doctors were not using the LCP properly, not to attack the pathway itself. Another common accusation is that families have to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2223836/I-survived-death-pathway-Patricia-82-given-days-live-family-defied-doctors-gave-water-straw--shes-planning-world-cruise.html\" title=\"\">\"defy doctors\"</a> by giving their relatives a drink \u2013 and yet the LCP states that patients will \"be supported to eat and drink for as long as possible\". Artificial fluid and food via drips or a naso-gastric tube may be appropriately stopped, but we need to challenge the impression that end-of-life care in any way involves stopping a conscious patient from eating or drinking. Where this has happened it is not the LCP as I know it.</p> <p>The gravest charge of all against the LCP, that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2161869/Top-doctors-chilling-claim-The-NHS-kills-130-000-elderly-patients-year.html\" title=\"\">\"NHS doctors are prematurely ending the lives of thousands of elderly hospital patients because they are difficult to manage or to free up beds\"</a>, is the most distressing, as it is a charge against every hospital doctor involved in end-of-life care, and its sinister overtones profoundly undermine the doctor-patient relationship at a time when patients are at their most vulnerable.</p> <p>The defendant in this alleged crime is \"NHS doctors\", which is sufficiently vague as to make it impossible to counter. When doctors do try to rally some defence, they are <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2225009/The-medical-professions-lethal-arrogance-Liverpool-Care-Pathway.html\" title=\"\">accused of arrogance</a>. Indeed, on hearing that I was writing this article, one colleague told me I was \"brave\" (I think he meant \"foolish\"). I cannot stop the Daily Mail writing 21 negative articles about the LCP in the month of October without a single column giving a differing view, nor can I prevent the Daily Telegraph from throwing its broadsheet might behind this powerfully destructive campaign, but I can stand up for what I believe in \u2013 which is the very best, person-centred palliative care.</p> <p>For what would critics like doctors to do instead? Insist that every patient be forced to continue with all active treatment until the bitter end? Refuse to stop blood tests, drips and needles in a patient who clearly has only hours to live? Decline the opportunity to receive treatment to relieve suffering in a patient dying in pain and distress in case they get sued? Well, I already know that neither of the newspapers behind the campaign want that. The hypocrisy of their campaign is illustrated by this interesting detail: during the height of their attack on the LCP in October, and without making any reference to it, both <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2223353/Give-dying-pain-relief-says-Prue-Leith-witnessing-brothers-agonising-days.html\" title=\"\">the Mail</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9633356/Prue-Leith-asks-Why-did-my-brother-die-in-agony.html\" title=\"\">the Telegraph</a> published the story of Prue Leith. She related the tragic story of her brother's painful death and how he endured agony because doctors were (wrongly, in my opinion) reluctant to prescribe sufficient painkillers. Leith was rightly angered by the way her brother died, and argued eloquently that: \"There should be a hospital protocol that if the patient and the next of kin want to end the misery, and two doctors agree the patient will be dead in a month anyway, they can increase the dose of drugs to the level sufficient to alleviate the pain, even at the risk of death.\"</p> <p>A protocol to alleviate suffering for dying patients? Now there's a good thought! Come to think of it, I think the Marie Curie Institute might have had that idea already \u2013 it's called the Liverpool Care Pathway.</p>",

  "<p>France's president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, sought to shrug off his business-bashing reputation on Tuesday with a \u20ac20bn-a-year (\u00a316bn) package of tax credits and other pro-industry measures.</p> <p>The prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, surprised many by announcing that the government would accept much of the recommendations of a report by Louis Gallois, the former EADS boss, on making the French economy more competitive.</p> <p>\"France is not condemned to the spiral of decline. But we need a jolt at a national level to regain control of our destiny,\" Ayrault said. \"This is about giving our companies room to manoeuvre.\"</p> <p>Firms will be offered tax credits worth up to \u20ac10bn next year, rising to \u20ac20bn by 2015, to be financed by an increase in VAT and \u20ac10bn in public spending cuts, as yet unspecified. That was less than the \u20ac30bn-a-year cut in payroll taxes that Gallois demanded, but far more than many analysts expected. The rebates will be proportionate to the size of a company's payroll, up to a maximum of two-and-a-half times the minimum wage, in an attempt to support jobs.</p> <p>Amid rising concern about France's global competitiveness, Hollande is keen to show that despite implementing a 75% top rate of income tax on the super-rich, he is on the side of business. Fabrice Montagne, of Barclays, said the announcement would \"improve sentiment vis-a-vis the government's economic policy, which will be welcomed by the president as approval rates are at significantly low levels\".</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund said in its annual report on the French economy, published on Monday, that without radical reform France could slip behind Spain and Italy, which have been hobbled by lack of competitiveness against the mighty German economy.</p> <p>The government's proposals, which will have to be passed by parliament before it can be implemented, also include support for training and small business, and investment in innovation.</p>",
  "<p>What can be wrong, in this internet age of harsh and ready opinion, with venting one's view of the world in 140 characters online? When footballer Ched Evans was convicted of raping a 19-year-old earlier this year a motley bunch of supporters \u2013 a teenage cousin, some drunken fans and even an unrelated biology teacher \u2013 shared their opinion that a woman too drunk to give consent but was raped anyway was a \"money-grabbing slut\" and a \"dirty slapper\". Apparently, they didn't even know that in shaming and, specifically, naming her, they were breaking the law.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-20214014\" title=\"\">After pleading guilty nine people must each pay \u00a3624 to the victim</a> \u2013 a total of \u00a35,616, which awards her less than a pound for each of the 6,000 times her name was dragged through the mud on Twitter. And who said the internet was free? In passing his verdict, judge Andrew Shaw said: \"For reasons that I had thought were within the common knowledge of most intelligent people in this country we offer further protection for the victims of rape by prohibiting the publication of their names and personal details.\"</p> <p>This case, in which a woman who teaches teenagers the facts of life can retweet the name of a rape victim unknowingly, suggests that the lifelong anonymity awarded to rape victims by the sexual offences amendment of 1992 is not \"common knowledge\" at all.</p> <p>And the speed and ease with which a young woman could be victimised virtually, as well as physically, raises more questions about anonymity itself \u2013 all at a time when rape crisis helplines are reporting a 20% increase in calls from victims of historic as well as current abuse, traumatised by the daily dose of horrors about Jimmy Savile.</p> <p>There are two main arguments about anonymity when applied to sexual offences that are increasingly entering the public debate. The first is that it's not really possible to protect or prosecute it in our wired world, nor is it feasible to expect authorities with limited resources to police the internet; the second that it is an outdated notion anyway, and that it is a freedom of speech issue to deny anyone the right to criticise or demean another person. Witness Naomi Wolf calling for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/05/julian-assange-sex-crimes-anonymity\" title=\"\">the women who have accused Julian Assange to be named</a>: he's famous, so why shouldn't they be, seems to be the argument. It isn't a huge leap from this to those who question why Evans is damned as a rapist (although currently appealing against his six-year sentence) while a woman too drunk to give consent remains anonymous.</p> <p>These are new and complicated issues, but that is no excuse for the surprising amount of wrongheadedness they have prompted. And this isn't just an argument down the pub \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/20/women-against-rape-anonymity-defendants\" title=\"\">the government itself tried to extend anonymity to the accused in sexual offence cases</a> and has shown no desire to do anything about how authorities could go about policing the internet. Fortunately, Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, <a href=\"http://blog.cps.gov.uk/2012/09/dpp-statement-on-tom-daley-case-and-social-media-prosecutions.html\" title=\"\">believes this is possible</a> and recently issued guidelines on prosecuting offences online, hoping to bring about a step change in the perception that <a href=\"http://blog.cps.gov.uk/2012/10/points-for-discussion-for-social-media-roundtables.html\" title=\"\">online bullying or victimisation isn't really bullying at all</a>.</p> <p>As for anonymity, there are specific reasons why it is awarded to sexual offence victims, and why it should be protected. Almost 90% of people who experience a serious sexual offence <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110220105210/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb0209.pdf\" title=\"\">don't report it to the police</a>. These statistics are from the British Crime Survey, which doesn't even count those without an address (the homeless, or those in mental health institutions, for instance). Victims fail to report for many reasons \u2013 but chief among them, according to many working at the front line in rape crisis centres, is the sense of shame and violation and the fear of stigma that will attach itself even if they have done no wrong. Rosa Knight, helpline co-ordinator at Rape Crisis, says: \"The main reason women don't go to the police is the shame. Anonymity when they do is absolutely crucial.\"</p> <p>Given the low rates of conviction in a world where his word against hers is usually all a jury has to go on, the hand towel of dignity awarded by anonymity should not be allowed to be thrown away by the combination of celebrity and technology. There is a misconception that women use the protection to falsely report rape, but <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/http:/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf\" title=\"\">the widest study </a> found that just 8% of reported rapes are classified by police as false accusations and this percentage is more than halved when classifications deemed uncertain, primarily because they are not based on an admission by the complainant or strong evidential grounds, are not included.</p> <p>It's time the outrage provoked by the Savile scandal changed the way our media understands and reports sexual abuse. Perhaps the way that the Daily Mail splashed on the \"\u00a3624 insult to a rape victim\" is a sign of changing times. The web has brought welcome light to much of our daily lives. But let's not hide behind the argument that anonymity is just not possible on the web. Let's embrace the few times we as a civilised society decide that it does some good.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 December 2012 to clarify statistics on false accusations of rape.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is owed hundreds of millions of pounds of unpaid debt on loans to autocratic governments in Argentina, Indonesia, Iraq and Zimbabwe for UK weapons and equipment that were used against civilians, an analysis of figures released by the government show.</p> <p>Britain lent Indonesia more than \u00a3630m to pay for British arms provided to General Suharto at a time when he was repressing protests. Some of the weapons, including armoured cars and jet aircraft were used in the 1990s against civilians in what is now East Timor, the former foreign secretary, Robin Cook, admitted at the time.</p> <p>Up to \u00a350m was lent to the Argentinian junta to buy British arms before the invasion of the Falklands in 1982. They included two Type 42 destroyers, two Lynx helicopters, and 22 Sea Dart missiles, according to documents in the National Archives discovered by the Jubilee Debt Campaign (JDC), which is calling for an end to what it calls \"unjust poor country debts\". One of the Lynx was the first Argentine aircraft to land on the Falklands after the invasion.</p> <p>The government lent \u00a312m for the export of Land Rovers to President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. The vehicles were supplied after he promised they would be used \"with due respect for human rights\". He said he would not use them for riot control, but Amnesty International said vehicles were used to crush demonstrations.</p> <p>Some \u00a3100m of unpaid loans were originally provided to Egypt under the former president Hosni Mubarak to buy British weapons; \u00a35.5m of unpaid loans were provided to Saddam Hussein's Iraq then engaged in a war of attrition against Iran.</p> <p>A proportion of the loans to Indonesia have recently been settled, though the country still owes \u00a3400m, most of which comprises debts for the purchase of British weapons, according to official figures.</p> <p>Tim Jones, policy officer at JDC told the Guardian on Tuesday: \"For years the UK government has claimed it is not possible to find out where debts come from. The figures released today show this was a lie. They reveal a history of horrendous loans to dictators such as General Mubarak, General Suharto and Saddam Hussein for military equipment. People in these countries should not have to pay these unjust debts.\"</p> <p>The UK government is demanding Egyptian people pay the debt inherited from General Mubarak and \u00a314m will be paid this year, according to the JDC.</p> <p>The figures are included in a <a href=\"http://www.ukexportfinance.gov.uk/publications/plans-and-reports/sovereign-debt-data\" title=\"\">report on sovereign debt data</a> by UK Export Finance, part of the Department for Business.

Imagine what Jon Stewart could have done about the issue of Scottish independence or Saturday Night Live could have done about the \"cash for access\" scandal or what Trey Parker and Matt Stone could have done with the Jimmy Savile story.\" </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19193358\" title=\"\">JeremyinOz heartily agrees:</a></p> <blockquote> \"When people compare British comedy favourably with American comedy (something that is getting harder and harder to do) they forget about the cartoon: South Park; the Family Guy stable and Matt Groening's work, which are consistently better and more biting than anything on British TV.

What do we have now in the way of standup on TV that makes you think? Stewart Lee buried on late-night BBC2 \u2026\" </blockquote> <p>Is anyone prepared to leap to the defence of UK comedy?</p>",
  "<p>Like her husband, Michelle Obama must wait until the results are in to find out whether she has another four years in Washington or gets to leave the White House and reclaim her life.</p> <p>It's hard to say which option she'd prefer because if the last four years have been tough for Barack Obama, they haven't exactly been a cakewalk for the first lady. But whatever the outcome of today's election the next four years will be easier for her. In either case they could be very different.</p> <p>Michelle Obama has never hidden her ambivalence about moving from Chicago to Washington. Even in this year's speech to the DNC she brought it up.</p> <p>\"Our life before moving to Washington was filled with simple joys,\" she said. \"Saturdays at soccer games, Sundays at grandma's house, and a date night for Barack and me with either dinner or a movie because as an exhausted mom, I couldn't stay awake for both. \u2026 And the truth is, I loved the life we had built for our girls.\"</p> <p>The daughters of the self-described mom-in-chief are older now \u2013 one of them is in high school. They are more independent. They need her less. She has more time to do what she wants. And because this would be her husband's last term in the White House, she could push the boundaries of the role of first lady if she so chose.</p> <p>Win or lose she has more options. Here are some for her to consider.</p> <h2>If Barack Obama wins</h2> <p><strong>She could change her issues.</strong> In her husband's first term, her first focus was on military families, but combat forces are already home from Iraq and are due to be out of Afghanistan within the next two years. While she can remain involved in the lives of military families and the problems they face post combat, this doesn't need to be a priority. Nor does obesity, which was a safe option for a first lady who didn't want to make waves. She can remain concerned with it, but as her heart never seemed to be in it, she should put it on the back burner (no pun intended).</p> <p><strong>She should be more vocal on behalf of women. </strong>As a lawyer, and a woman of eloquence she would be an antidote to the grey-haired men of the Republican party. She could become first lady in more than just name. If she speaks out on subjects like pay equity, childcare, even contraception people will listen. She has the power and the spotlight to make a real difference for women in and out of the workforce. An added bonus is, that if she did, it would add considerably to her husband's legacy.</p> <p><strong>She should position herself for a career after the White House. </strong>She will have four years to consider and prepare for whatever it is she wants to do next. By the time the Obamas leave Washington Malia will be headed to college and Sasha will be in high school. Michelle Obama could follow the Clinton model and head into politics herself, but she doesn't seem drawn to the political arena unless it's in a role like ambassador to the UN. But she'd have the time to try out a few ideas and make some relationships for the future.</p> <p><strong>She should write a book.</strong>No more gardening. But maybe she could put together a parenting book based on her unique perspective. After all she is the mom-in-chief, and there is the precedent of It Takes a Village. She'd get an enormous advance and the book tour would give her a platform to promote her ideas of child-rearing and family values.</p> <h2>If Barack Obama loses</h2> <p><strong>She should immediately reclaim her own professional achievements and get a job.</strong> If the family moves back to Chicago she could explore local community-based professional options. That seems to be where she was happiest before. She could even take those options national. There's no reason why she can't pick up where she left off but with more of a megaphone.</p> <p><strong>She should NOT host a talk show.</strong> The talk in Hollywood is that the former first lady could be the secret to daytime TV gold. They say she is so telegenic (and she is) she could be the next Oprah. But taking that path is selling herself short. She should confine herself to being a guest not a host.</p> <p><strong>She should re-embrace her alma mater.</strong> Obama admits that her Princeton years were not her happiest, but it's time she got over it. University officials have made at least six direct overtures to her to return to Princeton or speak at Princeton-affiliated events. (She even declined to attend her 25th reunion in May 2010.) In all but one case, she has rebuffed their advances, often citing a busy schedule, according the The Princetonian. Her Ivy League (don't forget Harvard law school) education is something she should be proud of and she should realize what an inspiration it could be to other women from less than privileged backgrounds.</p> <p><strong>She should continue writing op-eds.</strong> She wrote her first one last month, (\"Do children who go to an understaffed, crumbling school truly have a fair shot at success? If a family has a son or daughter born with a genetic disease, should they have to fight day and night with insurance companies just to get the insurance coverage they need?\") It was good. She has a voice and anyone will publish her. It's an easy way to keep her profile high and use her influence.</p> <h2>In either case</h2> <p><strong>She should take more risks.</strong> She has enormous influence, and nothing to lose. She should be more outspoken and more passionate about the causes she believes in. She should ditch the mom-in-chief title and revert to what she was before her husband ran for the White House \u2013 a bright well-educated, articulate, accomplished woman, inspirational in her own right.</p>",
  "<p>Residents of areas of New York and New Jersey that were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-storm-power-outages-restoration\">left without power when Hurricane Sandy struck last week</a> were on Monday being bused to non-damaged polling stations, in order to vote.</p> <p>Executive orders have been signed in both states to allow voters to cast their ballot at any booth, in an attempt to accommodate people who were forced out of their homes by the superstorm.</p> <p>Ernie Landante, a spokesman for the New Jersey Division of Elections, said: \"We are doing everything we can in this extraordinary situation not to disenfranchise voters displaced by Sandy. Their voices and their votes will be heard no differently than anyone else's.\"</p> <p>Officials in both states must also provide shelter for all those who are still without power, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/05/new-yorkers-storm-wait-shelter\">ahead of a storm which could hit the area as early as Wednesday</a>. The expected nor'easter could bring winds of up to 60mph and more flooding to areas which were hit badly by Sandy.</p> <p>In New York, up to 40,000 people are expected to need accommodation in the coming days. In cut-off areas of Staten Island and the Rockaways \u2013 a coastal region in the borough of Queens \u2013 some homeowners have endured an eighth night without power. On Monday, temperatures dropped to near freezing for a second consecutive night.</p> <p>New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, said on Monday that the city had adequate shelters for those who needed them. \"Every New Yorker who needs a warm place to live and a roof over his or her head is going to have one,\" he said, before adding that the incoming storm would make the work of emergency teams \"more difficult and more urgent\". Bloomberg said that housing everyone who needed help would pose a \"big challenge\".</p> <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said it had spent more than $200m on emergency housing assistance and had found places for 34,000 displaced people in hotels and temporary homes in New York and New Jersey. No long-term plan for accommodating all those hit by Sandy has been made.</p> <p>It is thought that more than a million homes and businesses are without power, as a result of downed lines and broken cables. Sandy has been blamed for more than 100 deaths in the US, adding to scores of deaths in the Caribbean. It is feared that with more bad weather on the way, hypothermia could claim move victims, especially among the elderly and infirm. Door-to-door searches are underway in New York, in an attempt to encourage those still suffering from loss of power to find alternative shelters.</p> <p>For some on Tuesday, voting was not an immediate concern. One Staten Island resident, Paul Hoppe, said he probably would not vote. He said his home, a block from the beach, was uninhabitable, his family had been displaced and their possessions ruined. \"We've got too many concerns that go beyond the national scene,\" Hoppe said.</p> <p>But for others, finding a polling booth was part of the transition back to normality. New York City authorities planned to run shuttle buses every 15 minutes to bring voters to the polls. Sixty of the city's 1,350 polling sites were unusable. Bloomberg said city residents should check the Board of Elections website, in order to find out about polling changes. \"Vote. It is our most precious right,\" he said.</p> <p>In the badly-hit coastal region of Ocean County, New Jersey, officials hired a converted camper van to bring mail-in ballots to shelters in Toms River, Pemberton and Burlington Township. \"It's great. This is one less thing I have to think about,\" said Josephine DeFeis from Seaside Heights, who voted on Monday.</p> <p>In New York and New Jersey, election officials were guardedly optimistic that power would be restored and that most polling places would be open in all but the worst-hit areas.</p> <p>New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order Monday allowing residents to cast a so-called affidavit or provisional ballot at any polling place in the state. Such votes will be counted after officials confirm the voter's eligibility.</p> <p>Cuomo said: \"Compared to what we have had to deal with in the past week, this will be a walk in the park when it comes to voting.\"</p>",

Listen here</a></p> <p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Chichester.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Tom Odell (vocals, piano).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> We went to see a new singer-songwriter called <a href=\"http://joebanfi.bandcamp.com\" title=\"\">Joe Banfi</a> the other night at the Social in London. He did that gruff post-Buckley thing that young musicians of a certain type tend to do these days. The room was hushed when he sang his raw ballads of infidelity, and the applause when he finished verged on the rapturous. This fellow, we thought, is going to make some (quietly emotional, increasingly torrential on the chorus) noise in 2013. But now we've heard Tom Odell and we're not so sure. If the male troubadour niche isn't quite as crowded as the <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/rainymilo\" title=\"\">female soul one</a>, there are still contenders out there, some of them serious (although whatever did happen to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/03/new-band-marcus-foster\" title=\"\">Marcus Foster?</a>). Can more than one make it? Let's see.</p> <p>The space may already have been filled by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY0oPg1h8fQ\" title=\"\">Jake Bugg</a>, even if Odell's music is more florid and arranged than the Nottingham boy's \u2013 he's classically trained, you know. We're still not sure what that means, or what effect being classically trained has on the student's compositions because we're not exactly talking Mozart here, but certainly there are voices stacked on top of voices and there are strings that swell as the singing becomes more passionate.</p> <p>Still only 21, he's signed to a major \u2013 the same one, incidentally, as the aforementioned Jeff \u2013 and we wouldn't be surprised to learn that one or two of them over at the label have muttered something about them having signed a Brit boy capable of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/24/praise-jeff-buckley\" title=\"\">Grace</a>. Although blond, he has a similarly tousled yet haunted quality. Those good looks, and that boyish sensitivity, have already won him, or at least his music, favour in the fashion world, as it featured during a recent <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBG7JTbioxE\" title=\"\">Burberry show</a>.</p> <p>There are four tracks on his debut EP and they range from averagely resonant to rivetingly sad. You may consider that Odell's performance on the song Sense is quite mannered or you may feel it genuinely captures what it feels like to experience real pain. It's like James Blake without the dubstep, the sound of one man perilously close to cracking up. It starts as just a voice and piano before he is joined by a series of humming, harmonising Odells. Another Love is equally ripe as Odell once again becomes his very own choir of fallen rough-boy angels. \"If somebody hurts you I want to fight \u2026 so I use my voice, I'll be so fuckin' rude,\" he croaks. Anger, betrayal, confusion, despair \u2013 and that's just us. Stay Tonight is just a demo, to be fair, but it does suggest that, unadorned and allowed to bellow, he could be just another advert for hoarse lassitude, a solo Stereophonic. Which we really don't need in 2013 at all.</p> <p><strong>The buzz: </strong>\"He falls into a space that borders James Blake's minimalistic territory, yet spills over into Alex Clare's soulful emotionality\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://trendland.com/tom-odell-another-love-sense-video\" title=\"\">trendland.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> It is really rather affecting, or a simulacrum of emotionality \u2013 you decide.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Have a nice day.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to: </strong>Wear a tramp's vest.</p> <p><strong>What to buy: </strong>The Songs from Another Love EP is released by Columbia.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Joe Banfi, Jeff Buckley, Kelly Jones, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJfnELzAOCA\" title=\"\">Passenger</a>.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://tomodell.com\" title=\"\">tomodell.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday's new band:</strong> Temples.</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street's decision to restrict the number of reporters travelling with David Cameron as he tries to sell arms to the Middle East this week has prompted a series of complaints from Westminster journalists, with the BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, taking the unusual step of going on the record to echo dissatisfaction shared widely across the lobby.</p> <p>No 10 granted access to Frank Gardner, the BBC security correspondent, who travelled with Cameron to the United Arab Emirates, prompting speculation that the prime minister's team are trying to secure better coverage by offering individual journalists scoops on trips abroad.</p> <p>Westminster correspondents are routinely invited to travel on the prime minister's plane whenever the head of government goes abroad on official business \u2013 but were surprised to be told in the runup to the Middle East visit that it would not be possible to join him and that there would be little or no access for reporters prepared to travel independently.</p> <p>Cameron arrives in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, as he seeks to advance arms deals and repair political relationships, on a short visit that No 10 made clear that there was little point reporters trying to follow. Lobby journalists \u2013 political reporters granted special access in Westminster and daily No 10 briefings \u2013 who were contemplating following him over from the UAE concluded they may struggle to clear immigration by the time his meetings were completed.</p> <p>Much of the close-knit lobby community is reluctant to criticise No 10 in public, but Robinson told the Guardian that he believed Downing Street had gone too far, even if on this occasion a BBC colleague had benefited. He said: \"There has always been a tension between politicians desire to control the media and political reporters need for access to those in power. For years No 10 has dreamed of stopping journalists travelling on prime ministerial trips. It is important that they remain just that \u2013 dreams.\"</p> <p>Others lobby reporters argue these efforts to tightly manage the media agenda are symptomatic of more short-term political considerations, where an under-pressure No 10 is struggling amid accusations of policy drift and is reeling from its failure to close down running stories such as the Andrew Mitchell \"plebgate\" row. But the sensitive nature of the trip to Dubai and Riyadh, whose regimes are not used to explicit media criticism, also provides a cover for greater restraint.</p> <p>Ironically, on this trip, Cameron has needed to be active on unrelated domestic issues, on Monday announcing an inquiry into whether a previous inquiry into allegations of the sexual abuse of children in care homes in north Wales \"properly did its job\". With an allegation that a senior Thatcher-era politician may have been involved in the abuse, the PM may have welcomed the opportunity to stay in touch with a wider section of the media.</p> <p>But Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former director of communications, said this was a difficult situation \"where there is a bit of right on both sides\". He said if the clampdown on the Gulf trip was \"a rare case\" in which using pooled coverage was more appropriate it could be justified, but added: \"If it is part of a broader strategy to limit numbers and cut the media out of access on trips, Nick and others might be more justified in their concerns.\"</p> <p>Close observers of the prime minister also believe Cameron has become increasingly impatient about devoting a significant proportion of his time giving interviews while abroad, when so much of the resulting coverage is critical of him and unrelated to the trip itself. That reflects other developments that suggest his growing lack of enthusiasm for media engagement \u2013 the last of the supposedly \"monthly\" press conferences held by Cameron in fact happened last year.</p> <p>Complicating the picture further is that Craig Oliver, the No 10 director of communications, appointed from the BBC to replace Andy Coulson, is not popular within the lobby itself, and many Westminster journalists believe that he too is under pressure to improve the PM's image. Few want to criticise Oliver publicly because he remains a potential source of news, but he is seen as focused on television, and in particular on the BBC's Six and Ten O'Clock news bulletins \u2013 with little appetite for regular jousting and building relationships with the rest of the press corps.</p> <p>The result of bringing Gardner along was seen on Monday night's Ten O'Clock News programme when he filed <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/i/b01nr0xp/?t=18m34s\" title=\"\">a report towards the end of the evening bulletin</a> which focused on Cameron's visit, his efforts to sell Typhoon jets, and human rights issues in the region. There was no off-topic questioning aired about the swirling allegations of child sex abuse in North Wales that may embroil a once-prominent Conservative politician.</p> <p>When travelling abroad, the prime minister charters a plane, usually from British Airways or Virgin Atlantic, and places are typically provided for newspaper and broadcast journalists who buy an economy class ticket to sit at the back. Aside from Gardner, only a handful of reporters are travelling around with the PM on Monday and Tuesday. Their number comprises two wire journalists, including Joe Churcher, the chief political correspondent with the Press Association \u2013 and a BBC producer and camera person producing pictures to be shared by all broadcasters.</p> <p>Bringing along the press pack guarantees coverage \u2013 broadcasters are usually promised an on-camera interview with the prime minister on the trip \u2013 while press are supposed to be kept busy with a regular supply of briefings to justify the time being spent out of the office by all concerned.</p> <p>However, given the news dominating the headlines tends to be unrelated to the overseas trip in question, the focus of the media tends to be on domestic issues \u2013 and a pack mentality can emerge as reporters chose to converge on a single story.</p> <p>No 10 sources indicated that it was not possible to hire a plane large enough to accommodate the media on the Gulf trip and because of the logistics of the visit, in particular its short duration and the number flights involved.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

While not defeated \u2013 prices will be reduced in a bid to boost sales \u2013 its footwear nemesis is showing signs of weakness.</p> <p>In truth, these signs have been there for a while. Uggs are undeniably comfortable \u2013 they're more often worn as slippers in their native Australia \u2013 but the ubiquity of them, and their many imitations, has led to overkill. Bad press has been growing. In a survey in 2010, they were voted <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1283451/Ugg-The-items-clothing-women-think-fashionable-men-hate.html\" title=\"\">one of the 10 items men don't like on women</a> and a judge recently ruled <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9603739/Wearing-Ugg-boots-while-driving-can-cause-accidents-judge-warns.html\" title=\"\">they can be dangerous to wear while driving</a>.</p> <p>They originally gained fashionability in 2001 <a href=\"http://www.zimbio.com/photos/Cameron+Diaz/Hot+Item+Ugg+Boots/etuon9u2l8d\" title=\"\">when they were worn by celebrities including Cameron Diaz</a>, but recent advocates include <a href=\"http://grocerystoresnew.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/joey-essex-shows-who-wears-trousers-as.html\" title=\"\">Joey Essex</a>: hardly an advert for a chic, off-duty look. Rana Reeves, founder of brand agency John Doe, believes this has damaged the reputation of the brand. \"I'd say they're in a similar position to when Daniella Westbrook wore Burberry,\" he says. \"They need to go back to basics.\"</p> <p>That's certainly not something the brand has been doing recently. Instead, expansion has been the policy. With sales increasing by <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2009/08/18/pf/deckers_uggs_boots.fortune/index.htm\" title=\"\">as much as 67% in one quarter of 2009</a>, confidence has been understandably high \u2013 and has led to some questionable ranges appearing alongside the classic boot. The firm has expanded into high-heeled styles with price points over \u00a3300, handbags, and even a bridal collection. It might be a case of one spongy step too far. \"Ugg's core product is seasonal,\" says Honor Westnedge, senior retail analyst at Verdict Research. \"While it has tried to diversify into new ranges, these have struggled to achieve the same level of popularity as its winter boot collections.\"</p> <p>Westnedge points to the relatively high price of Uggs as a problem, \"in a period of limited discretionary spending\", and suggests that consumers are unlikely to buy more than one pair. There's also the issue that they may simply be out of vogue. New competitors in the boot market include Hunter, Le Chameau (the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/02/duchess-french-boot-marwyn-chameau\" title=\"\">brand favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge</a>) and, recently, Converse. In contrast to Ugg, Hunter has seen its profits rise \u2013 38% last year \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/Retail_and_leisure/article1136816.ece\" title=\"\">style leaders from Kate Moss to Sarah Jessica Parker wear its boots</a>. Reeves believes its success is down to a savvy marketing policy. \"They stay true to what they are,\" he says. \"They're functional, they keep your feet dry. Hunter have done some collaborations but they have never tried to be fashion. That's what Ugg did, and that's where they went wrong.\" Fashion has long rejected Uggs \u2013 it looks like the rest of the populace is finally following its lead.</p> <h2>Five uses for an old Ugg boot</h2> <p><strong>1. Crap gloves </strong>Uggs are only unfashionable on your feet. Stroll around with them on your hands and people won't know what to think.</p> <p><strong>2. Insulation </strong>Got an uninsulated pipe about the size of your shin? Whack an Ugg on it. Problem solved.</p> <p><strong>3. Weasel beds </strong>Most weasels find their beds cold and uncomfortable. Let's do something for them, guys.</p> <p><strong>4.Fashionista repellent </strong>A single scrap of Ugg boot worn on a lanyard around the neck will keep away all but the most foolhardy fashion snobs. Win.</p> <p><strong>5. Safer throwing boots </strong>Tired of accidentally braining a six-year-old when you hurl your wellingtons across the park? Softer equals safer.</p> <p><em>Tom Meltzer</em></p>",

  "<p>Dear Santa,</p> <p>This is the second letter I have written you this year. Mummy made me tear up the first one. I was going to ask you for a new computer, a robot butler that will tidy my room while I'm out, this season's St Johnstone kit, Savage Murderbastard 7 for the Xbox, a new bike and a Nadine Dorries Jungle Bugmuncher Action Figure (the one with swivelling eyes.)</p> <p>But now Mum says I'm not allowed to make a list for Santa any more. She's in something called the Mothers' Union and apparently <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/healthandwellbeing/b0074315/bailey-review\" title=\"\">Reg Bailey</a> and <a href=\"http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/pages/about-rowan-williams.html\" title=\"\">Rowan Williams</a> \u2013 who I have to tell you are the oddest looking mummies I've ever seen \u2013 have said that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9655522/Ban-Christmas-lists-for-children-urges-charity.html\" title=\"\">Christmas lists should be banned by parents</a>. I must confess, Santa, my first thought was that instead of asking you to bring me lots of lovely toys, I would just ask you to send a posse of elves round to visit those guys and kick seven jingling bells out of them with pointy little boots, but I'm a good boy so I won't do that, and I'm not going to cry or pout either. I know you hate that stuff.</p> <p>Instead Santa, I'll take this opportunity to thank you for the Pop-up Guide to Social Research and Statistics you kindly left in my stocking last year. It certainly came in useful in keeping Granny quiet on Boxing Day although it hasn't helped much in making sense of the <a href=\"http://www.comres.co.uk/poll/780/mothers-union-christmas-list-survey.htm\" title=\"\">polling data</a> that inspired this new commandment. For example, if 44% of parents have felt pressurised by a child to buy a present they can't afford, and 52% say they haven't, is that a good thing or a bad thing? How do the numbers compare to 10 or 20 years ago, or to other countries? Can you tell me, Santa, because, frankly, I'm buggered if I know.</p> <p>I've been writing to you for a long time now, Santa. I wonder if you remember the time more than 40 years ago, when all I asked you for was a pot of strawberry jam? I never told you about the silent tears when you left me a jar that was identical to the delicious, natural, home-made preserve that spilled out of Mum's kitchen cupboard from June until Mould every year. You see, what I really wanted was a jar of luminous red chemical gel, ideally with a racist logo on the label. I should probably have been clearer about that at the time.</p> <p>So I probably never thanked you for that particular gift, but I do now. You taught me a valuable lesson about the true meaning of Christmas that day. I learned that Christmas is not about expensive toys, gifts and shiny things. Christmas is not about receiving, it is about disappointment \u2013 crushing, heartfelt, soul-scarring disappointment.</p> <p>As you know Santa, I'm a dad myself now, with two rumbustious boys of my own. Nothing bonds us together more as a family than when our 10-year old stomps into the room and breezily asks for an iPad for Christmas. Mum and Dad will lovingly tilt our foreheads towards each other, check the other's expression, raise an eyebrow, look at our son adoringly then laugh uproariously in his face.</p> <p>Santa, we both know that when you sneak into their bedrooms once a year you snaffle the mince pie and whisky, feed Rudolph half a carrot, then fail dismally to deliver everything on their lists. It's OK, don't feel guilty, their Christmas is not spoiled. They are far too busy being disappointed by all the crap you did bring to remember the things you missed.</p> <p>So perhaps you could do us all a favour, Santa, before your busy season gets going. Just pop down the chimneys of Bailey and Williams, and have a quiet word. Explain that learning about realistic expectations and the art of negotiation is a key lesson in life, and suggest they use their influence to remind parents that it is OK to say no, with or without a Christmas list. They'll listen to you, they envy your beard. As for me, I'll cope without a bulging pillowcase full of non-biodegradable junk. But if you could see your way to the Dorries doll I'd be ever so grateful. I've already bought the voodoo pins.</p> <p>Festively yours,</p> <p>Ally (aged 45\u00be)</p>",

  "<p>Saudi-watchers and bloggers - and the official media - are having a field day over the appointment of the kingdom's new interior minister, Mohammed Bin Nayef. The significance of the sudden move is that he is the first of the younger generation of the Al Saud to be given one of the top jobs in the kingdom \u2014 which is being taken as a good indicator of the likely future succession.</p> <p>King Abdullah is 89 and in poor health, Crown Prince Salman 76 and frail. Bin Nayef is well known and respected in the west, especially by its security and intelligence agencies, from his years as deputy minister of the interior, coordinating counter-terrorist efforts and running a successful \"de-radicalisation\" programme for repentant jihadis. He had an extraordinarily lucky escape in August 2009 when an al-Qaida suicide bomber from Yemen blew himself up in the minister's palace but left his target only lightly injured. Panegyrics<a href=\"http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/11/05/247837.html\"> in the Saudi press </a>predictably focus on his vision, humanity and peerless security record.</p> <p>MBN, as he is known in leaked US diplomatic cables, is just 53 and thus counts as a youngster in the Saudi system. He is the son of the late Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz, who died last June after serving as interior minister for three decades. The US-educated Mohammed replaces his uncle, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, who took on the role after his brother Nayef died. There has been speculation that he was replaced because the king was angry over recent incidents in the restive Eastern Provinces and other security lapses. On Monday, 10 recently released Saudi militants were arrested after a clash with border guards as they attempted to infiltrate into Yemen. Two soldiers were killed.</p> <p>If the immediate motives for the appointment are unclear the longer-term significance of the family background seems obvious. The bottom line is that MBN is the first grandson of the kingdom's founder Abdulaziz Ibn Saud to be appointed to one of the main leadership positions in the country in recent years. It certainly puts him in the running to be crown prince-in-waiting - and a future king. Change at the top in Saudi Arabia still takes place at a glacial pace - despite (or perhaps because of) the winds of change elsewhere in the region. This therefore counts, most observers agree, as a highly significant move. </p> <p> In the <a href=\"http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/saudi-resignation-prompts-fresh-succession-debate#.UJh\">words </a>of the veteran Saudi-watcher Simon Henderson: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>For the United States and others, the appointment will force observers to recalibrate their understanding of Saudi Arabia's power structure. And to the extent that the reshuffle was not predicted, it will spark new awareness of the opacity of the kingdom's decision- making.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But back in 2009 MBN was<a href=\" http://www.scribd.com/doc/43649166/Assassination-attempt-improves-Mohammed-Bin-Nayef's-fortunes-GSN-Issue-863-23-October-2009\"> marked as a favourite</a> by Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi, the Emirati commentator, who pointed to another factor which seems to put the new minister in line for the very top job:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>MBN's claims to the throne are unrivalled in one aspect: out of some thousands of Al-Saud royals, including the top 100 or so involved in security affairs, MBN is one of the very few to be able to claim that he has 'paid in blood' for his country \u2013 and that is a tough claim to beat.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>A prison officer shot dead in an ambush last week represented \"those things completely the opposite of the murderous thugs and bloodthirsty criminals who took his life\", a minister at his funeral on Tuesday told mourners.</p> <p>David Black was described as a man of kindness, committed to peace in Northern Ireland. The 52-year-old was murdered by Republican dissident paramilitaries in an attack on his car along the M1 motorway outside Portadown last Thursday.</p> <p>Cookstown in County Tyrone came to a standstill at lunchtime as shops and businesses closed, and hundreds turned out in the town the centre to pay their respects.</p> <p>Up to 20 prison officers in uniform flanked Black's coffin as it was taken from the family's home following a private service to Molesworth Presbyterian church. There was also a discreet security presence, with sniffer dogs deployed to search the church grounds.</p> <p>Mourners included the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Matt Baggott, the director of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, Sue McAllister, the first minister of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson, and the leader of the SDLP, Alasdair McDonnell. The deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, is understood to have offered to attend the funeral, but the family requested that no members of Sinn Fein should turn up. McGuinness is understood to have expressed his desire to respect the family's wishes.</p> <p>Condemning those responsible for killing Black, who was a regular attender at Molesworth Presbyterian church in Cookstown, the Rev Tom Greer said: \"It is so terrible that evil men with such hatred in their hearts should rob us of a great man like David with love and kindness in his heart.\"</p> <p>He said many prisoners who had been guarded by Black told how his help and advice had turned their lives around.</p> <p>\"David viewed his work as something that was meant to improve society. He wanted those who came into prison to leave as changed men,\" Greer said.</p> <p>He also paid tribute to the murdered officer's widow, Yvonne, and his children Kyle and Kyra for urging that there be no retaliation over the killing.</p> <p>\"They have determined not to seek revenge or to encourage it in anyone else. They long to see justice done, but will not meet other people's bitterness and hatred with any of their own. They set an example to us all,\" he added.</p> <p>Three men who were arrested following the fatal shooting have all been released unconditionally.</p> <p>David Black was the 30th prison officer murdered by paramilitaries since the early 1970s. He was buried after a private ceremony in Kildress parish cemetery.</p> <p>As the funeral was taking place, several hundred people turned up for a vigil at Belfast city hall organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. A lone piper played a lament and Black's killers were denounced from the platform by the trade union movement.</p>",
  "<p>Hot on the heels of a successful <a href=\"http://www.solace.org.uk/home.asp\" title=\"\">Solace</a> Summit in Coventry, the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2012/oct/30/local-government-leaders-manchester-round-up\" title=\"\">gathered local government leaders</a> and private sector colleagues in the splendour of Manchester City Hall. We bristled with ideas and optimism, giving little of the often-encountered doom and gloom seen in public sector events of recent times.</p> <p>But the question I discussed \u2013 is localism simply rhetoric, or a reality? \u2013 raised a number of dilemmas. Are we having the debate in the right language with government? Too often, localism is used by public sector managers as a proxy for control or direct provision. If we want localism to mean transforming growth and partnerships in our localities, why do we so often just demand powers, control and the return of services to local councils?</p> <p>Where are residents in localism debates? We are adept at arguing for grand narratives of economic strategy, freedoms and flexibilities and elaborate partnership structures of which there are currently no great shortage (LEPs, CCGs, PCCs), but these are all as opaque to residents as their many predecessors. How often do we forget that the average resident is more concerned about, as I have heard one person put it, \"grit and dog shit\"?</p> <p>Finally, there is the perennial issue of trust. Still at the heart of localism debates, still thorny in our relationship with government. Can we overcome the continuing lack of trust? Are we demanding enough? If localism is too often cast as a petulant cry for \"more control\", how is the paymaster ever to trust us more?</p> <p>Fear not, there are solutions. Elected members and our unique democratic mandate pose challenges for councils on engagement and turnout, but also grant us that unique legitimacy to broker the partnerships that years of fiscal crisis will inevitably require.</p> <p>Trust can, and will, be rebuilt based on delivery records that stand up. Think of the imaginative offers from community budget pilots writ large; these offer real hope, not just to reduce dependency and stop the artificial bumping of costs from local authority services into the welfare system, but for place-based budgets that can cut through localism dilemmas that local leaders have wrestled with for decades.</p> <p>Ultimately local design matters most for localism \u2013 and true localism remains in the eye of the beholder.</p> <p>What works in Blackburn may not work in Manchester, Bolton or even London. But if the right mix of a vision for place, strong organisations and assertive political leadership makes thatarea tick then let's celebrate it, and dismiss for good the view that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2012/oct/30/local-government-leaders-manchester-round-up\" title=\"\">localism is \"frankly meaningless\"</a>.</p> <p><em>Tom Stannard is director of policy and communications at </em><a href=\"http://www.blackburn.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Blackburn with Darwen borough council</em></a><em> and a member of the Guardian local government network </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><em>editorial advisory panel</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/local-government/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for opinion, analysis and job opportunities direct to you</strong></p>",

  "<p>The head of a compounding pharmacy blamed for a meningitis outbreak that has killed 30 people in the US has been summoned to appear before a House committee, alongside drug regulators.</p> <p>The energy and commerce committee of the House of Representatives said Monday that Dr Margaret Hamburg, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will testify before lawmakers on 14 November. Barry Cadden, co-founder of the New England Compounding Centre (NECC), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/05/us-meningitis-new-england-cases-47\">which sent thousands of contaminated steroid shots across the nation</a>, has also been asked to attend.</p> <p>On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 409 cases of fungal meningitis had been recorded in 19 states. The contaminated steroid injections are also thought to be responsible for 10 peripheral joint infections.</p> <p>Health regulators have formally matched the fungal meningitis to a contaminate found at the premises of NECC in the Boston suburb of Framingham. Agents from the FDA raided NECC last month, as part of a criminal investigation. One of the areas under investigation is whether the company violated regulations by supplying bulk orders to clinics without matching the drugs to specific prescriptions or patients.</p> <p>NECC has a chequered history of violating health and safety standards, having been cited on numerous occasions by the FDA prior to the latest outbreak. The company is already the subject of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/12/meningitis-outbreak-minnesota-pharmacy-compounder-court\">a number of civil lawsuits brought by people affected by the meningitis outbreak.</a> After it was identified as the likely source of the infection, the NECC recalled all of its products, amid fears that other drugs had been contaminated.</p> <p>The energy and commerce committee has yet to hear from Cadden. It has also invited James Coffey, director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy, to testify.</p> <p>Compounding pharmacies fill special orders placed by doctors for individual patients, turning out a small number of customised formulas each week. But some, like NECC, have in recent years grown into much larger businesses, supplying bulk orders of medicines to thousands of doctors and hospitals across the country.</p> <p>House and Senate lawmakers have called for hearings to examine how the outbreak of fungal meningitis could have been prevented and if greater safeguards are needed in the oversight of compounding pharmacies, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/13/meningitis-outbreak-massachusetts-regulations\">which operate in something of a regulatory grey area</a>.</p> <p>FDA officials said last month that new laws may need to be enacted, in order to clarify the federal government's role in overseeing the sector.</p>",
  "<p>The first thought Binta Jobe has on waking each morning is of the day she was taken, aged nine, by family, into the bush and forced to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM). It was done without anaesthetic, by an old woman with no medical training. Now the 23-year-old Liverpool-based asylum seeker from the Gambia is fighting to save her three-year-old daughter, Aisha, from the same fate.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation defines FGM as \"all procedures that involve partial or total removal or injury of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons\". It estimates that up to 140 million females worldwide have experienced the procedure, including 92 million in Africa.</p> <p>\"I dream of blood,\" says Jobe, who suffers recurrent infections, sexual problems and pain as a result of the surgery. \"It's an abuse. I just want Aisha to be able to grow up stronger than I am. We have no choice about it in our country. I did not understand that I had rights until I came to the UK.\"</p> <p>Jobe arrived in the UK in 2008 to join her husband who had come to study. Within weeks of Aisha's birth, there was talk of arranging her circumcision. Jobe fled with her daughter. She applied for asylum in 2010, based on her belief that she and her daughter will be tracked down by extended family and Aisha subjected to FGM if they are forced to return to the Gambia.</p> <p>FGM is still legal in the Gambia, where, according to Unicef, about 78% of the female population undergo the procedure. Under the UN 1951 Refugee Convention, fear of being forced into FGM is grounds for seeking asylum. It is also regarded by the UN as torture and as \"inhuman and degrading\". Yet the UK Border Agency (UKBA) refused Jobe's application for asylum and her last appeal was turned down in September 2012.</p> <p>\"After careful consideration, both we and the courts have ruled that [Jobe] is not in need of asylum. The court found [she] could live safely elsewhere in the Gambia and that the law provided sufficient protection for her and her daughter,\" says a UKBA spokesman.</p> <p>The government launched the UK's first <a href=\"http://www.janeellison.net/newsdisplay.php/2011-12-07/new_parliamentary_group_on_female_genital_mutilation_launched\" title=\"\">all-party parliamentary group on FGM</a> in December 2011 to address FGM both here and abroad. FGM is illegal in the UK under the 2003 Female Genital Mutilation Act, as is sending UK residents abroad to undergo the procedure.</p> <p>Jobe's case has been taken up by human rights lawyer, Peggy Layoo, who is applying for a judicial review. Layoo condemns UKBA's stance as \"utter hypocrisy\".</p> <p>She says: \"FGM is akin to rape, but it is not being taken seriously by UKBA. It is a denial of the suffering of women in the third world. We all know that FGM is going on, yet the government does not want to do anything about it.\"</p> <p>A 2001 study estimated 66,000 African women in England and Wales had undergone FGM, and a further 23,000 girls under the age of 15 were at risk. Jobe's case is viewed by many of those working with asylum seekers as the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>Jobe's pupils dilate with fear at the prospect of returning to the Gambia. She was only 13 when she was married against her will to a family friend more than 20&#xa0;years older than her. She cannot read or write. Young women like herself live in compounds in the Gambia with an extended family and she says a single woman arriving in this small country would stand out and be found by family who would punish her for going against her culture.</p> <p>\"If I go back to the Gambia I might as well just say, 'Here I am, come and take me.' It is a place of gossip and they will just track me down. I will just end up losing my child,\" Jobe says.</p> <p>Sylvia Chant, professor of developmental geography at the London School of Economics and an expert on the Gambia, submitted a report as evidence to back Jobe's case. She agrees that Jobe would have few options \u2013 for example, prostitution \u2013 if she returned to the Gambia, that both she and Aisha would be extremely vulnerable to violent victimisation and neither would receive any state protection.</p> <p>UKBA says the Gambia has begun making moves to change the culture around FGM, working with Gamcotrap, one of the oldest women's rights NGOs in the Gambia, and through local \"dropping of the knife\" ceremonies.</p> <p>Lauren Butler, an immigration case worker at Rochdale Law Centre, is working on four asylum cases similar to Jobe's involving FGM. She thinks UKBA's decisions are often based on unreliable sources and are made from a middle-class, white perspective. \"They are not apprehending the situation. It is something between wilful ignorance and cultural disbelief,\" she says.</p> <p>UKBA states: \"Female genital mutilation is an abhorrent crime, and we are working with international agencies to help prevent women and girls becoming victims.\"</p> <p>But Maurice Wren, director of charity Asylum Aid, accuses the government of double standards. He says: \"At a time when government is publicly promising action against FGM practised in the UK, it is appalling to think that women and girls who have claimed asylum here are being sent back to face exactly the same abuse overseas.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed</p>",
  "<p>This autumn sees a decisive democratic vote \u2013 it is of course the decision of the church's General Synod to approve the final legislation on female bishops. What makes it poignant is two things \u2013 first that the process has been so very slow that I suspect I used the very same jokey intro four years ago at the time of the last presidential election. Second, there are still smart people who think the vote may be lost.</p> <p>There are not enough dedicated opponents of female bishops to muster a blocking third in any of the three \"houses\" of synod \u2013 although it is close in the House of Laity. But their ranks may be swelled by the dedicated supporters, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/WtxLuI\" title=\"\">who feel</a> that the present legislation is an unacceptable compromise that enshrines discrimination.</p> <p>The legislation that the synod will be asked to vote on is an attempt to do justice to two utterly irreconcilable groups \u2013 those who believe women must be bishops, and those who believe they can't be. The compromise on offer, as with female priests, is to allow opponents to carry on with their parish life as if there were no female bishops \u2013 they can demand to be served only by men, and more particularly, only by men who will not themselves ordain women. This is a small minority of the bishops, so the opponents also want guarantees that there will always be a supply of new bishops and priests who reject the ordination of women.</p> <p>Something like that is more or less what they were promised in the convulsive panic that overtook the Church of England in 1992 when it realised that the synod had actually made a decision. No one had planned for that. There was talk of thousands of priests leaving. In the event, several hundred did leave for Rome and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Wty2h7\" title=\"\">most of them stayed</a>. The real resistance came from conservative evangelicals, committed to the position that the Bible forbids women to teach men doctrine.</p> <p>So a compromise was assembled, promising the opponents \"an honoured place\" within the Church of England. This was not a promise made entirely in good faith. It was assumed that resistance would simply wither away, as large parts of it have. There's no doubt that an overwhelming majority of the laity can't now see what the fuss was all about. But within the clergy, and among conservative evangelicals, a hard core of resistance remained. They are determined that their theology, and their bishops, will survive. For this to happen, they have to concentrate their forces within particular parishes, served by bishops who have never laid hands on a woman to ordain her.</p> <p>They want the right to do this to be enshrined in law.</p> <p>The management of the synod, the archbishops and a majority of the bishops, were prepared to offer this. But the synod as a whole <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/10/anglican-clergy-rejects-concessions\" title=\"\">rejected it</a>. It's not clear, either, that parliament, which must approve the final legislation, would vote through any law so clearly discriminatory. So the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/jan/24/church-of-england-female-bishops\" title=\"\">bishops tried again</a>. This time, they came up with a \"code of practice\": the law will specify this must exist, but not specify its content. For opponents it's too little. For many supporters, it's too much. But it still seemed impossible that the compromise could fail. Not even the Church of England could spend so long lumbering up to jump a hurdle, and then collapse in a twitching heap at the decisive moment. If this church were a horse, the owner would shoot it.</p> <p>Yet, suddenly, a full dress fiasco looks possible. Over the weekend, you could hear the sound of gears shifting in panic, as the majority in favour of female bishops realised that the legislation might actually fail when the synod votes on it later this month. Watch, the main pressure group campaigning for female bishops, issued a statement which <a href=\"http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/005724.html\" title=\"\">almost endorsed the legislation</a>. Earlier, it had refused to do so. A campaign on Twitter and Facebook was organised by the <a href=\"http://churchmousepublishing.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Church Mouse</a>, an influential blogger and occasional contributor here: Mouse wants ordinary church members to put pressure on their synod representatives to vote.</p> <p>If the legislation fails, it could be another seven years before the synod votes again on female bishops, according to its secretary general, William Fittall. But some of the most determined campaigners for equality think they could bring in a new measure in two years' time. This one would have no place at all for opponents. And the temptation to go for broke in this way may prove enough to scuttle the compromise that Rowan Williams worked so hard to broker; to end his time in office with an absurd and humiliating defeat; and to leave the question in limbo and church politics in purgatory.</p>",
  "<p>Changes to welfare will lead to increased numbers of tenants abandoning their homes, higher rent arrears, and higher reposessions as residents are given the responsibility to pay their rent.</p> <p>We have seen the headline figures of what welfare reform may mean for housing business plans, and the potential of millions of pounds that organisations could lose in rent if residents fail to make payments.</p> <p>Here are some tips for housing providers on how to work with your staff and suppliers to manage voids and avoid major loss of income.</p> <h2>1. Get some focus</h2> <p>Consider establishing a dedicated voids management team, trained in managing the organisation's quality standard, self-inspection and hand-over process. This will help to streamline and speed up the process of re-letting, and reduce the cost of duplicating resources and time.</p> <h2>2. Introduce the new tenants</h2> <p>Voids are not traditionally a customer-focused process but there are steps to take while a void property is still vacant to reduce future re-lets. Engage with the new residents by encouraging them to visit the property while the void team is still working. This can allow residents to choose their kitchens and bathroom suites, if these are being replaced, helping them to establish roots in the home. Hopefully this means they are more likely to take pride in their home, which helps an organisation reduce its costs by minimising the turn-over of properties.</p> <p>Once the property is complete and the new resident is about to move in, your team can also be made available to show the residents how to use the central heating, where the electricity cupboard and stop-cap are, and answer any other questions the residents may have. If you work with an external contractor they should be able to offer these options.</p> <h2>3. Plan ahead</h2> <p>There are some common stumbling blocks that hold up the void process, such as handling keys and clearing debts on existing gas and electricity meters. The management of keys and key boxes is a practical but important issue. Managing access to keys carefully means there will be no hold up for community teams, inspectors, occupational therapists and housing officers who need to access the home. You can overcome problems with power by working with energy suppliers to get the electricity switched on ahead of void works commencing, so that once you enter the property work can start immediately.</p> <h2>4. Use mock ups</h2> <p>Train your apprentices and staff in turning voids around quickly by setting up a mock void property for them. This helps to establish a clear void standard and that is agreed and used by contractors and in-house teams. Standardising furnishings across properties would speed up the process so there is no time lost ordering fixtures and fittings.</p> <h2>5. Name and shame?</h2> <p>It may be a good idea to invest in an incentive scheme for residents who leave their properties in good, clean condition \u2013 or even set up a naming and shaming scheme for people who don't. You could also offer decorating vouchers to residents instead of redecorating properties. This helps make residents more responsible for their homes and helps develop their skills, as well as speeding up the turn-around time by reducing the amount of work to be done when a tenant leaves.</p> <h2>6. Be smart</h2> <p>Thinking carefully about your operations and planning helps reduce time and costs. After considering its processes, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2012/jun/08/bpha-housing\" title=\"\">BHPA</a> decided that where windows needed attention, they could be replaced after the property was relet to reduce the turnaround time. The average void time is now just six days.</p> <p>You can also use the void process to cross-check your estate data, confirming when the boiler was serviced, what other defects there are, and what elements of the property requires maintenance.</p> <p>The financial impact of empty homes will be more critical to housing associations than ever before. Providers need to work with suppliers now to make sure that voids times are not wasted and that their void services do not expose them to criticism or unnecessary lost revenue.</p> <p><em>Mike Turner is development director at </em><a href=\"http://www.ianwilliams.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Ian Williams Group property services</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for the latest jobs and career opportunities in your area</strong></p>",
  "<p>England remain optimistic that Stuart Broad and Steven Finn will be fit to take part in the first Test which begins in Ahmedabad on 15 November, although neither may play in the final warm-up on Thursday. Finn has not played since pulling up with a thigh strain during the tour opener at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai last week, and over the weekend Broad underwent a scan on his left heel which he had bruised while bowling during the second match in Navi Mumbai. His injury is not serious and England intend to monitor his progress with a view to getting overs into him in the match. He is unlikely to be risked, however, if there remains any suspicion that taking part would damage his Test prospects. Finn is said to be making excellent progress and, as he is viewed as a key member of the pace attack for this series, they would be prepared to play him in the first Test without the match practice.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a row is brewing over the naming of the trophy for which the two teams will be playing. Sharmila Tagore, the widow of India's former captain Tiger Pataudi, who died last year, is adamant that an agreement had been struck to name the trophy \u2013 for which the two teams competed in England in 2011 \u2013 along with a memorial lecture, after her husband and that the Board of Control for Cricket in India has reneged on an agreement to make the decision formal. However, a trophy named after Anthony de Mello, the first secretary of the Indian cricket board, was instigated in 1951 and it is this that the BCCI says is for home series between thesides and appears to have decided will be the name on the series.</p>",
  "<p>At the polls Tuesday, some voters will matter more than others. And those <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g1HdKOeUIB5xMj3VoMXL3BN08ZKQ?docId=CNG.adb9ff56d5c1edfae8b9a4b7e819ccb1.131&amp;index=0\">voters are likely to be women</a>. </p> <p>It's a women's election, and a women's economy, for perhaps the first time in American political history. </p> <p>We see some acknowledgment of the political power of women in the way <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g1HdKOeUIB5xMj3VoMXL3BN08ZKQ?docId=CNG.adb9ff56d5c1edfae8b9a4b7e819ccb1.131&amp;index=0\">the campaigns have courted women</a>. But as to the economic power of women, the emphasis has been much lighter. President Obama cast healthcare, and abortion, as economic issues \u2013 which they are, partly. Ads for Mitt Romney included women worrying about student debt. </p> <p>But the real economic power of women \u2013 over the coming fight over tax breaks, over unemployment, over wages \u2013 has been largely ignored during the campaign season, and is likely to be ignored after the election as well, unless women do something about it. Even though women hold more economic power than ever, women are still not indicating that they are willing to make these economic issues into flashpoints, in the way that health issues have been. </p> <p>The jobs picture and the economy are usually secondary issues for female voters, trailing abortion by a large margin, according to a recent CNN poll. Abortion is the issue that women, at least in that poll, said they would consider the most important in the election \u2013 perhaps because it has been openly threatened more than the economic rights of women have.</p> <p>But the economic rights of women are threatened \u2013 every time they're not spoken about, every time they're ignored in favor of another debate about empty chairs or a fringe politician's definition of rape. When the news cycle and the campaign spin and the talking points don't address the economic future of women, outside of healthcare, it's like diminishing the growing influence of women as economic beings (and not only reproductive ones). </p> <p>We've heard how women are going to be a political force in this election. Women <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html\">make up over half of the population of the United States</a>, according to the most recent US census. <a href=\"http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/voters/turnout.php\">More women than men have voted in the past three presidential elections</a>. Women also make up 60% of undecided voters \u2013 the crucial \"swing vote\" that has President Obama and Governor Mitt Romney running themselves ragged to win.</p> <p>Even though undecided voters comprise only 4% of all voters, neither candidate has the luxury of sacrificing those crucial swing votes. This year, there is also a record number of women are running for high political office, with 18 women running for the Senate and 163 running for the House. But while women wield political power, they also wield the power to push for economic changes \u2013 power that is, currently, largely unclaimed. </p> <p>University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson co-wrote a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/what-mitt-romney-doesn-t-know-about-families.html\">recent political piece on how families work \u2013 which, usually, depends on how women work</a>. As she was doing her research, \"the thing that struck me is this idea that women are secondary workers, on the sidelines in the economy thinking about joining the labor force.\" That depiction is not accurate, Stevenson said: \"They are very much in it.\"</p> <p>In fact, there is no question that women are an economic force now more than in any previous election. More than half of all women are the breadwinners in their households, and the <a href=\"http://blog.al.com/huntsville-times-business/2012/09/number_of_women-owned_business.html\">number of women-owned businesses has grown nearly 66% since 1997</a>.</p> <p>And yet, the economic power of women remains largely unacknowledged. Pay equity has been an all-but-absent issue during the campaigns, and certainly one without any concrete policy proposals on either side. Several of the tax breaks that may be impacted by the fiscal cliff affect women disproportionately, like the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/28/how-the-fiscal-cliff-would-affect-the-poorest-americans/\">earned-income tax credit or the child tax credit</a> that matter for single mothers.</p> <p>Women have largely gained, not lost, jobs since 2009, <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/job-growth-improves-in-october-for-both-women-and-men-women-gain-53-percent-of-jobs-added-women-now-have-net-job-growth-since-february-2009\">according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research</a>. Still, there is a gap of 1.8m jobs between men and women. </p> <p>It's a given that not all women have the same economic interests, in the same way that not all women have the same religion or the same view on the US supreme court. In fact, the voting gap between married and unmarried women is even greater than the gap between men and women, said Emily Martin, vice-president and general counsel for the National Women's Law Center. Single women have a very different picture of their financial power and interests than married women do.</p> <p>As Betsey Stevenson pointed out, married women are in households where their interests interwine with those of their husbands. Perhaps for that reason, married women have been, in polls, similar to men: they lean towards Romney. <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/11/02/on-election-day-single-women-could-sway-the-vote\">Single women lean towards Obama</a>.</p> <p>But neither type of woman seems, so far, to lean toward holding the feet of the president and Congress to the fire over improving wages and equality in the workplace. It may not be long before women start thinking that way, at least according to one economist. Eileen Appelbaum, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If you're not the main breadwinner in your family, then perhaps other issues, those social issues, may loom larger.</p> <p>\"But this has changed radically, because of the rising unemployment among women, and because so many women are the breadwinner or the co-breadwinner in so many American households now.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, when it comes to the idea that women don't vote according to the economy or jobs or government deficits, \"that may be changing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Five years ago, when Apple came out with the first iPhone, the device experience was far ahead of the competition, and Apple ended up completely disrupting the Telecom industry. Back then, Steve Jobs made the famous remark that with the iPhone, Apple was five years ahead of the competition.</p> <p>And now, five years later, the iPhone 5 is battling it out with increasingly strong competition. And that smartphone battle is now about services more than it is about hardware.</p> <h2>Hardware as Trojan horses for better services</h2> <p>When you read the reviews for the recently launched devices, much of the hardware commentary focuses on the aspects that make the service experiences on the devices better. Fast 4G network connectivity speed is all about faster data to power service experiences. A bigger and brighter screen allows you to see more content and do more things with the services that you use on your device.</p> <p>Better batteries of course allow you to use services for longer without recharging, and faster device processors allow service designers to push the boundaries of their user experience on the device.</p> <p>Almost none of the things that people care deeply about are purely about hardware any more.</p> <p>The \"lightning port\" on the new iPhone is a notable exception \u2013 many people reacted negatively, and part of the reason is that it's merely a hardware change that didn't bring new service value.</p> <h2>Apple's strategic service focus</h2> <p>It's well known that Apple makes virtually all its money selling devices with high margins, and clearly Apple is very good at hardware design. But the biggest and most sustainable competitive advantage that Apple has over others is the iOS services ecosystem.</p> <p>When you analyse the iPhone 5, it's also clear that Apple knows the crucial role of services. There are no big breakthroughs on the hardware or user interface front. Arguably, this is not because Apple thinks its UI and hardware is perfect, but because Apple has deemed it more important to double down on other areas of the iPhone \u2013 namely services.</p> <p>Last year's big iOS innovation was Siri. It's telling that Siri is the only software that the perfectionists at Apple have released in beta mode \u2013 it speaks volumes about the strategic role and importance of the voice-activated virtual assistant service. The iOS 6 version of Siri is faster, more responsive, and more flexible. This is a service that Apple considers vital for its future.</p> <p>With the iPhone 5, Apple went one step further still. They booted the wildly popular Google Maps off iOS and replaced it with their own mapping service. With Siri, Apple had brought a slightly flaky but genuinely innovative new service to market. But with maps, they replaced a loved and popular Google service with their own inferior solution. The reactions have been very harsh. How come Apple downgraded maps on their devices? Surely they knew it wasn't better than Google Maps?</p> <p>They did it simply because control over a maps service is a necessity for them long-term. They risk alienating loyal users in order to build their own service platform \u2013 instead of relying on others. This shows how important services are to the future of Apple and to iOS.</p> <h2>The service assets of Nokia and Microsoft</h2> <p>Microsoft has numerous powerful service assets \u2013 from cloud services and Skype to Xbox and Outlook. But arguably, the most powerful asset they have going forward is the range of service developers that will create solutions for Windows 8. This will offer a massive boost to the Windows ecosystem, and will benefit Windows Phone 8 manufacturers.</p> <p>After an ill-fated push into music with Ovi Music some years ago, Nokia are now re-entering the music service business with the streaming Nokia Music service. Nokia's acquisition of mapping platform Navteq five years ago was widely criticised for the high price tag. However, today Nokia's mapping platform powers four out of five in-car navigation systems globally, Nokia will power the maps in Amazon's latest Kindle Fire devices, and Nokia Maps are regularly receiving excellent reviews when compared with other mapping solutions, including Google Maps. Nokia Maps is clearly one of the company's crown jewels. The combined service assets of Microsoft and Nokia are impressive and mutually beneficial.</p> <p>In comparison to both Apple and Nokia, the recent smartphone launches from Motorola and HTC feel unsatisfying. While their hardware is certainly good enough to compete, the lack of smart service solutions leaves the devices flat when compared with the might of Apple's ecosystem and the magic of their virtual assistant Siri, and also when compared with the photography innovation or the mapping excellence showcased by Nokia.</p> <h2>Services are Samsung's Achilles heel</h2> <p>Samsung has long been a fast follower. But they currently sell more smartphones than anyone else, including Apple. Their Android-based smartphones have sold in the millions, and they are currently the only smartphone manufacturer other than Apple that makes significant profits. One of the reasons that they're so successful is that they spend vastly more money than anybody else on marketing its smartphones.</p> <p>But Android is Google's baby, and Samsung have not traditionally been an innovator with services.</p> <p>Samsung has not brought many own service experiences to their smartphones. This lack of service expertise is likely to become a significant challenge for Samsung over the next phase of the smartphone battle. While Samsung sells lots of devices, their customers are unlikely to be very loyal to them. When the next shiny experience from someone else appears \u2013 and there's a growing range \u2013 they might well try out another manufacturer's device.</p> <h2>The US vs China</h2> <p>All of the most important smartphone operating systems are now creations that originate from the west coast of the US \u2013 iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. This is because the US tends to be better at software than other countries, and also because the creators of these operating systems \u2013 Apple, Google, and Microsoft \u2013 are all focusing on either developing or integrating with useful and desirable digital services.</p> <p>If hardware would be the most important factor in the race for gadget supremacy, China would be the king of gadgets. However, the gadgets that are capturing people's imagination and are changing the world tend to be brilliant service and software solutions, wrapped in desirable hardware. China hasn't yet produced any brands that in the West stand for service and software excellence. The focus on software and services gives the U.S. a head start over China.</p> <h2>Services to the rescue</h2> <p>As PayPal's Carey Kolaja observed, the technology \"NFC\" is often mistakenly confused with mobile wallets. Carey's point is that while digital wallets will become an indispensable part of consumers' everyday lives, and one that will save them time and money, consumers don't care which underlying technology is used to enable the wallet. As she put it, \"the iPhone 5 doesn't have NFC \u2013 so what?\"</p> <p>It will become increasingly hard for device manufacturers to compete and differentiate on the basis of technical or hardware features alone. Instead of being unique selling points, the technical features and hardware specs \u2013 Megapixels, Gigahertz, RAM, screen size, and network connectivity \u2013 are relegated to hygiene factors. If you have too little, it's too bad. But having the most is not necessarily helping you sell more devices any more.</p> <p>What people truly care about is fast and reliable access to useful, engaging and innovative services that deliver real value.</p> <p>As the world's leading companies are increasingly going mobile first, and as mobile device sales rapidly shift from feature phones to smartphones, it also impacts society. The digital divide will start to shrink, as digital services and information is increasingly reaching everyone \u2013 not through computers, but through affordable smartphones.</p> <h2>It's what's on the inside that counts</h2> <p>Of course hardware still matters \u2013 especially when the device purchase decision is made. People naturally respond to physical objects and experiences. The weight, size, and colour of devices are clear considerations when people decide which gadget to buy. Smartphone screens are like magnets for people's eyes \u2013 the bigger and brighter, the stronger the magnetism. Smartphone technology can still amaze, as evidenced by the fact that Nokia's 808 \u2013 equipped with a monster 41Mp camera \u2013 won the \"Best of Show\" award at Mobile World Congress this year. In the fast-emerging wearables space, taste is meeting technology. Hardware like Nike's FuelBand and Jawbone's UP are smart fashion objects, and looks clearly matter.</p> <p>But smartphones have become so much more than simple utilities for us. They connect us to our loved ones, they allow us to access important information at any time, and increasingly they help guide us through all aspects of life. They have graduated from tools to life companions. And just like in human relationships, while appearances matter, it's what's on the inside that counts. The devices that offer the best access to well-designed living services that evolve with us will win the mobile race that's only just begun.</p> <p><em>By Olof Schybergson, founder and CEO of </em><a href=\"http://www.fjordnet.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Fjord</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>You may recall that the end of May saw an unusual flurry of activity in the UK. The commencement of enforcement of the ePrivacy legislation saw a lot done, and even more written, about complying with the slightly nebulous requirement to obtain consent from users before depositing cookies on their system when they visit your website.</p> <p>The need to assess what cookies any given website actually dropped led to a general spring clean and wholesale removal of many tracking pixels. And then, at the last minute, the ICO declared that assumed consent would be fine, so, provided that sites reasonably informed users about the practice, they need not concern themselves with getting a user's explicit consent.</p> <p>Cue a collective sigh of relief from the industry as a whole, a springing up of lots of little boxes on websites saying, \"We use cookies, please be aware\" and everyone going back to business as usual, albeit with greater awareness of how cookies work and with a generally tidier internet.</p> <p>This situation has persisted largely untroubled for the past five months in the UK. While it has been recently reported that the ICO may start \"getting serious\" about imposing large penalties on non-compliers, this is mere speculation. The ICO themselves have remained silent on the matter.</p> <p>But how come the ICO aren't making more of a fuss? It is largely because the debate has moved on \u2013 the irons in the fire that are of much greater consequence are Do Not Track and the EU Data Protection legislation.</p> <p>Do Not Track is at base a sensible approach to provide a way users can indicate their privacy preferences to websites <em>without</em> using cookies, which are clunky to manage, get deleted and used for heaps of other things, too. However, it's dispiriting that fundamental questions \u2013 \"What does 'Track' mean?\", \"What should websites do if it's set to 'on'?\" and \"What if the user wants some websites to track them but not others?\" \u2013 are yet to be resolved, more than two years after the standard was first mooted.</p> <p>Microsoft's stance to enable it by default in IE10, hence torpedoing it as an indicator of user consent, has further muddied the water. Neelie Kroes has recently voiced her disapproval of the chaos gathering around DNT, while not mentioning at all the fact the ePrivacy directive that is actually law is being all but ignored. Saving Do Not Track is deemed far more worthy of attention than arguing about a law that was only ever going to be a stopgap measure.</p> <p>The EU Data Protection change is even more far-reaching and significant. It goes way beyond internet cookies and advertising, but does codify a couple of things that affect online advertisers; Recital 24 blithely introduces the concept of \"online identifiers\", which could potentially be considered personally identifiable information, while article 4, part 8 rehashes the definition of \"consent\". As the new legislation is a regulation (law as written by EU) rather than a directive (law once you've made a local version), this will definitely result in further heartache.</p> <p>It is also revealing to look at the European countries that enabled the legislation before the UK. Not a single penalty has been imposed due to not obtaining consent for cookies, and a quick review of some major Spanish and French sites indicates a general lack of mechanisms in place to obtain even the assumed consent that has gained currency in the UK. The CNIL in France clearly don't view this as an issue worth wasting their time on \u2013 and, God knows, they are happy to pick fights with anyone if they feel one is justified.</p> <p>So, the powers that be have ultimately all but admitted that the law is bad and not worth enforcing.</p> <p>It had enough weight to cudgel the industry into tidying things up a bit and has served its purpose \u2013 we should now be ready to take on the more grown-up challenges of Do Not Track and Data Protection legislation updates. It may have taken us all more than two years to get to where we are, but that was only a first step, I'm afraid.</p> <p>What's the outlook? This was never going to be a situation with a nice neat end point. Industry players need to do the right thing by consumers but equally engage with trade bodies and their customers to ensure the correct balance between users' needs (right to privacy/anonymity) versus users' desires (free, user-friendly online services) is reflected in best practice and ultimately the law.</p> <p><em>Tim Sleath is business manager, global data and targeting, at </em><a href=\"http://www.exponential.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Exponential</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Ah, Nadine Dorries. In her ongoing bid to add to the gaiety of nations, it has been announced that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/nov/06/nadine-dorries-im-a-celebrity\" title=\"\">the MP formerly known (somehow more fittingly) as Nadine Bargery is out in the Australian jungle, ready to compete on I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here</a>. She <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20217901\" title=\"\">decided to go because 16 million people watch the show</a>, she says, and is looking forward to \"lively, heated debates\" about the abortion time limit around the campfire. But what other treats can fellow contestants \u2013 who include boxer David Haye, EastEnders star Charlie Brooks, comedian Brian Conley and former Doctor Who Colin Baker \u2013 expect from the tempestuous MP over their witchetty grubs? What will there be for them to look forward to after a day spent masticating a kangaroo's undercarriage? And will learning about Nadine's past and passions send prospective contestant, the inimitable Grace Jones, running for Sydney's blue mountains?</p> <h2>MPs expenses</h2> <p>At the height of the scandal in 2009, as the Daily Telegraph's revelations rolled out day after day, Dorries told the Today programme the newspaper was executing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/may/22/mps-expenses-conservatives\" title=\"\">\"almost a McCarthyite witch-hunt\"</a>; she had already suggested <a href=\"http://blog.dorries.org/\" title=\"\">on her blog</a> that \"everyone fears a suicide\". That blog came into sharp focus when her own expenses were investigated. The site gave the impression she spent most of her time in her Bedfordshire constituency \u2013 although she had designated this her secondary residence, which enabled her to claim expenses. She explained this to the parliamentary standards commissioner, who later cleared her of wrongdoing, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/oct/21/nadine-dorries-mp-blog-70-fiction\" title=\"\">by stating her blog \"is 70% fiction and 30% fact</a>. It is written as a tool to enable my constituents to know me better and to reassure them of my commitment to Mid Bedfordshire. I rely heavily on poetic licence and frequently replace one place name/event/fact with another.\" Later, she said this was a throwaway comment, and <a href=\"http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/News/MP-rues-claims-of-website-blog-fiction.htm\" title=\"\">\"the figure should have been the other way around\"</a>. 30% factual? 70% fiction? Keep a close eye, viewers!</p> <h2>Christianity</h2> <p>Nadine has said she's \"<a href=\"http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/0/919D816A95535BBC80257340004530DE/$file/War%20Cry%202%20Jun%202007.pdf\" title=\"\">not an MP for any reason other than because God wants me to be</a> ... I am just a conduit for God to use\". All well and good. But she has also said she constantly tries \"to do what Jesus would do\", which conjures up the unlikely image of Christ in an alligator tank competing against Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather, while Ant and Dec cheer them on.</p> <h2>Abstinence</h2> <p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_SE.pdf\" title=\"\">evidence</a> that US states that stress abstinence education have some of the highest levels of teenage pregnancy, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/may/04/nadine-dorries-sex-education-lessons\" title=\"\">Nadine last year called for this to be a key part of the British sex education curriculum</a>, aimed particularly at girls. She justified this with <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1389523/Nadine-Dorries-Im-calling-compulsory-chastity-belts-But-teach-girls-boys-just-say-NO-sex.html\" title=\"\">much talk of how young kids are being shown to \"apply\" a condom to a banana</a>. The bill was opposed by Labour MP Chris Bryant who called it \"the daftest piece of legislation I have seen\", impressively avoiding the quip, \"absolute bananas\".</p> <h2>Gay marriage</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/05/06/tory-mp-nadine-dorries-gay-marriage-is-for-metro-elites-and-should-be-binned/\" title=\"\">On the Conservative Home website earlier this year Nadine wrote</a> that \"gay marriage is a policy which has been pursued by the metro elite gay activists and needs to be put into the same bin. I have yet to meet a gay couple in my constituency or beyond who support it; in fact, the reaction has been quite the opposite. Great Britain and its gay couples don't live on Canal Street in Manchester, shop in The Lanes in Brighton or socialise at [sic] Gaydar in London.\" Except for all those who do, of course. She went on to say the policy \"is divisive, unpopular with the public\" \u2013 while <a href=\"http://www.stonewall.org.uk/documents/living_together_2012.pdf\" title=\"\">a YouGov poll published this year</a> found 71% of people support it.</p> <h2>Elitism</h2> <p>In an act of jaw-dropping political harakiri, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17815769\" title=\"\">Nadine took to the BBC's Daily Politics</a> earlier this year to say: \"Not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who don't know the price of milk, but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, no contrition, and no passion to understand the lives of others \u2013 and that is their real crime.\" On The Andrew Marr Show, George Osborne replied that \"Nadine Dorries, for the last seven years, I don't think has agreed with anything either myself, David Cameron, or indeed most Conservatives in the leadership of the party have done\". For once, few people could disagree with either MP.</p> <h2>Abortion</h2> <p>She has already said she wants to talk about her support for a 20-week abortion time limit while she's out in the jungle \u2013 but will she talk about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/may/19/women.gender\" title=\"\">13-week limit she favoured</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/may/19/women.gender\" title=\"\">when I spoke to her about the issue in 2008</a>? Or the nine-week limit that someone calling themselves Nadine Dorries while commenting on the Spectator website opted for? When it comes to Nadine, you just never know ...</p>",
  "<p>Laos has long been seen as a poor, landlocked, sparsely populated country. But it is at last emerging from its isolation. Once a part of French Indochina, ranking as the poor relation among its neighbours, it is now shaping up as a new contender in south-east Asia, with growth slated to exceed 8% this year, the highest in the region. This week the capital, Vientiane, hosted the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia%E2%80%93Europe_Meeting\" title=\"\">Asia-Europe Meeting (Asem)</a>, attracting sudden international attention to this small nation of 6.5 million.</p> <p>So what is driving the Lao economy? A one-party socialist republic since the revolution in 1975, it has taken the same course as its two much larger neighbours, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\" title=\"\">China</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vietnam\" title=\"\">Vietnam</a>, opening its market to the outside world but under strict government control.</p> <p>At the ninth congress of the Lao People's Revolutionary party (LPRP) in March 2011, the president, Choummaly Sayasone, spelled out the country's priorities: sustained growth of 8%, poverty reduction and improved education. These promises accompany the determination for economic reform, including floating publicly owned companies on the stock market.</p> <p>Given its initial handicap, the figures have been fairly encouraging. Per capita GDP in the Lao People's Democratic Republic has risen from $300 in 2001 to $1,200 in 2011. The government aims to achieve average annual income of $1,700 over the next three years. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/worldbank\" title=\"\">World Bank</a> now ranks Laos among \"low middle-income\" countries, and it might achieve \"upper middle-income\" status by 2020. It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/10499134\" title=\"\">due to join the World Trade Organisation</a> at the end of the year.</p> <p>The reasons behind this turnaround are clear. In addition to the travel trade, Laos has capitalised on its substantial mining, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/forests\" title=\"\">forestry</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/hydropower\" title=\"\">hydro resources</a>. The Nam Theun 2 dam, built by France's EDF, may account for as much as 8% of state revenue next year.</p> <p>However, last year another hydroelectric scheme, on the Mekong, had to be shelved due to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/apr/18/mekong-hydropower-xayaburi-laos\" title=\"\">hostility of countries downstream</a>, concerned about the environmental impact.</p> <p>On the political front, Laos has been run by the LPRP ever since the Pathet Lao took control in 1975. Power is concentrated in the central committee, itself capped by the 11-member politburo. The government and the prime minister, Thongsing Thammavong, are tasked with implementing the decisions of the party. The main role of parliament, with its 132 deputies, is to rubber-stamp decisions taken upstream, but recently there have been signs of greater freedom of expression and more open criticism, particularly regarding corruption and poor management of public funds.</p> <p>Laos started experimenting with free-market economics in 1986, at the same time as the \"renewal\" policies decided by its \"big brother\" in neighbouring Vietnam. The system has evolved along similar lines to China, with no freedom of speech, zero tolerance for dissidents, and growing wealth among the party elite and military. The inherent shortcomings of such a system encourage clientelism and corruption, both of which hold back sustainable, more egalitarian development. The inadequate schools and health service exacerbate skills shortages in a country where more than a quarter of the population is illiterate.</p> <p>Why are China and Vietnam so interested in Laos? It seems that China has been its top foreign investor since 2010. Large areas of state-owned land have been allocated to Chinese firms, which have invested in rubber plantations and other forestry schemes, particularly in the north, now very much under Chinese influence. But with most senior party cadres still being trained in Hanoi, the regime seems anxious to balance its foreign policy to make room for Vietnam too.</p> <p>The Chinese, who have always competed with the Vietnamese, are now trying to use Laos as a forward base and transit route for a major communications link between south-west China and south-east Asia. But things do not always go as smoothly as it might like: in 2011 a high-speed rail link partly funded by the China Development Bank and intended to connect Yunnan to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, via Laos, was shelved indefinitely.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article appeared in </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from Le Monde</em></p>",
  "<p>It is somewhat simplistic to observe the chaos in many western economies and believe, as Seumas Milne optimistically states, the \"neoliberal capitalist model\" is crashing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/19/new-world-order\" title=\"\">(New World Order coming to an end, 26&#xa0;October)</a>. While it may be true that much of what the public believes was a stable financial system has crashed, international banking cartels and transnational corporations have hardly disintegrated.</p> <p>If anything, the transfer of public money into corporations deemed too big to fail has further demonstrated how successful the elites have been in protecting their power. Indeed, many of the world's central banks are still printing money and receiving interest and influence at the expense of the millions of unemployed in recession-hit nations.</p> <p>In addition, the use of the war on terror to further indebt countries is working well. This is particularly true for the big protagonists. The US and the UK have huge military budgets, so the cost of these multiple wars are profits to an assortment of private military contractors and arms manufacturers, many being subsidiaries to some of the world's largest corporations. Suffice it to say, sales are booming.</p> <p>Before we celebrate victory over the New World Order perhaps we should dig deeper and see where the money and power are really going.</p> <p><strong>Lisa Kattnick</strong><br>Mullumbimby, NSW, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 I am perplexed by Seumas Milne's optimistic piece. So the twin towers are attacked, the war on terror begins and taxpayers fund huge budget deficits to bolster the military-industrial complex. In summer 2008 Lehman Brothers is allowed to collapse, its assets swallowed up by other giant banks. Hedge funds make millions.</p> <p>Roll on to 2012, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney fight another excessively funded election. Much of their foreign policy agenda is indistinguishable while lobby groups ensure any changes to corporate regulation remain typically toothless.</p> <p>Europe continues to fall deeper into recession. With unemployment rising and civil unrest simmering unelected technocrats and economists take centre stage in decision-making. All this as central banks fight for their interest payments and the government assets that await privatisation.</p> <p>When the world faces such problems those behind the scenes consolidate wealth and shore up their dominant position; wars and economic restructuring are useful tools for this game. The elite and their New World Order are alive and kicking, working diligently towards greater profit and more control. I will not be celebrating the crumbling of the global order any time soon.</p> <p><strong>Mathew Kollar</strong><br>Nelson, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p><strong>American English thrives</strong></p> <p>\"The British are coming! The British are coming,\" DD Guttenplan warns his compatriots: but Americans need not fear Brit encroachment on their colourful language <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/28/britishisms-american-language?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Welcome invasion, 12 October)</a>. The Yanks are over here linguistically, and their turns of expression are already deeply embedded in English parlance. Why do we say \"in the doghouse\" when we keep our dogs in kennels? Why do we say \"married on a shoestring\" when we tie our shoes with laces, not with strings? Why do we say \"coming out of the closet\" when we keep things in cupboards?</p> <p>And then there are the rapid changes in pronunciation, when we tamely go over to the way Americans speak, rather than our own. Think of the \"arrilies\": \"primarily\" is a prime example. We used to say it with the stress on the first syllable, but now it's pry-<em>marry</em>-li, in the American way. The same goes for all the other arrilies, voluntarily, necessarily, temporarily etc. Nobody under the age of 60 pronounces these words in the good old-fashioned English way. Very harassing!</p> <p>But still, we must admit that they have contry-booted very much to our way of speaking, and distry-booted their terms of expression throughout the English-speaking world. Take these two sentences I heard from colleagues: \"He must have went.\" \"I used to could.\" Utter grammatical solecisms, one would say, but they were spoken by American teachers of English \u2013 showing they are quite willing to take liberties with grammatical rules for colourful effect.</p> <p>Who else would have come up with \"modem\" \"upload\" \"downsize\" and other such invaluable expressions? The very versatility of American English and its adaptability to technological and economical change keep English in the forefront of international language choice.

Some direct encounters from Rosin's personal experience are glossed over quickly in support of ribald canards like, \"Bethenny was doing too much, but she was making it work and she had her freedom.

Maggie Hassan hasn't raised the specter of creating a sales or income tax, while supporting mostly liberal positions on social issues, including abortion and gay marriage to which Lamontagne is opposed. Both support the second amendment, though they differ on specifics: Hassan wants \"common sense\" restrictions, where Lamontagne is for concealed handguns without a permit. They also have opposite views on requiring car passengers to wear seat belts: Hassan is for; Lamontagne against. </p> <p>Hassan seems to have opened a slight edge, but whichever party wins, the slightly Democratic-leaning presidential race in this state will likely take the governor's mansion, too. </p> <h2>Montana</h2> <p><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10pm ET</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Governor Brian Schweitzer (Democrat) is term-limited </p> <p><strong>Swing counties:</strong> Yellowstone (slightly Republican-leaning in 2008, yet slightly Democratic-leaning in 2004)</p> <p><strong>Candidate county strengths:</strong> Democratic \u2013 Cascade, Lewis and Clark, Missoula, Silver Bow.

Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Steve Bullock are locked in a tight battle, in which you have both candidates supporting gun rights, some form of a tax rebate or cut, and reducing the state budget. They divide along the traditional Democratic and Republican lines on the social issues of abortion and gay rights (though Bullock is opposed to gay marriage). Outside money has flooded the race on the issue of oil, which is booming in the eastern part of the state. Bullock, generally, is for more liberal positions on energy, while Hill wants to \"drill, baby, drill\".</p> <p>Hill probably will be carried across the finish line by Republican Mitt Romney, yet Democrats have been on a roll in statewide races in Montana of late.</p> <h2>Washington State</h2> <p><strong>Polls close:</strong> 11pm ET</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Governor Christine Gregoire (Democrat) is retiring</p> <p><strong>Swing counties:</strong> Kitsap (slightly Republican-leaning), Pierce (slightly Republican-leaning), Snohomish, Whatcom </p> <p><strong>Candidate county strengths:</strong> Democratic \u2013 King and Thurston.

Democrat Jay Inslee is what you'd expect from a Democrat running in a blue state: he's pro-choice, for gay marriage, for light rail, for eliminating a two-thirds majority in the state legislature to raise taxes, pro-marijuana legalization, and wants to link business tax credits to hiring workers. </p> <p>Republican attorney general Rob McKenna is socially moderate and fiscally conservative: pro-choice but against forcing insurance sponsored by the state to cover abortion, pro-gay rights including being against the Boy Scouts anti-gay policy yet against same-sex marriage, against light rail, against eliminating the two-thirds rule for raising taxes, for medical marijuana but against legalization for all, and big on tax credits for small business. </p> <p>McKenna's hopes may rest on his education positions, including support for merit pay and a ballot referendum for charter schools, which Inslee opposes. I'd have to think Obama can carry Inslee across the finish line, though it's certainly possible McKenna might break the Democrats' long-time hold on the governor's mansion.</p>",

He just picked a real country and caricatured it as corrupt and very silly.</p> <p><strong>So what's the real Kazakhstan like?</strong> Corrupt and very silly. Nursultan Nazarbayev has won two decades of widely criticised elections with around a 95% share of the vote, and even changed the law to personally exempt himself from term limits. Which may go some way to explaining why right now he is doing his best to emphasise the country's silliness.</p> <p><strong>What's he done? </strong>He has <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/2010/dec/07/kazakhstan-president-scientists-research-ageing\">instructed Kazakh scientists to go in search of the elixir of life</a>, and, after two years and a few million quid of research, they have invented yoghurt.</p> <p><strong>Hold on.

To which he responded: \"I'm willing to go on to 2020. Just find me the elixir.\"</p> <p><strong>As a joke, surely? </strong>Maybe at first. But he then asked Kazakh scientists to look into \"the study of the prolongation of life\" on three separate occasions that year, even telling them: \"People of my age are really hoping all of this will happen as soon as possible.\"</p> <p><strong>So they brought him a yoghurt? </strong>Well, they had&#xa0;to&#xa0;bring him something. Zhaqsybai Zhumalidov, chair of the Life Sciences committee,&#xa0;announced their findings last week:&#xa0;\"We have created a bio-product called Nar.

  "<p>A \"damning\" report into library closures up and down the country has found that councils making plans to shut branches without taking proper account of local needs risk breaking the law.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/library-closures/\" title=\"\">Commons culture, media and sport select committee's enquiry into library closures</a>, published on Tuesday, advised that \"some local authorities, under considerable pressure to quickly find cost savings, have drawn up plans without taking proper account of local needs for library services and the variety of options available to provide them, and are therefore in danger of failing in their statutory duty to provide a 'comprehensive and efficient' library service\".</p> <p>The report did not name these local authorities. In September, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/05/library-closures-ed-vaizey\" title=\"\">culture minister Ed Vaizey decided not to intervene</a> in the high-profile closures or handing over to volunteers of library branches in Bolton, the Isle of Wight and Lewisham, finding that each council \"continues to offer a comprehensive and efficient library service\", as required by the 1964 libraries act.</p> <p>The inquiry into library closures is the first since 2005, when the service was found to be \"in distress\". This time, John Whittingdale MP, chair of the committee, said that while the \"current crisis may appear to bode ill for the future of public libraries, it also presents an opportunity for a thorough reassessment of their role and of the way they are organised\".</p> <p>MPs cited statistics showing that adult visits to libraries declined steeply between 2005/06 and 2010/11, from 48.2% to 39.7% of the adult population, but there had been no statistically significant decrease over the past few years, and children's visits remained at a very high level (75.6%).</p> <p>They were told by Annie Mauger, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (Cilip), that it was \"simplistic\" to paint a picture of steady decline.</p> <p>\"We can't deny that there is a decline but it is not of a scale at the moment that would suggest that this is a service that is utterly in decline, and there is a correlation with reduction in budget,\" said Mauger in her response to the inquiry, pointing to the fact that in 2011 there were 314m visits to libraries and 300m loans of books, a decline of 2.3% and 2.9% compared with the previous year. The decline is set against a cut of 6.3% in library budgets and 14% in stock acquisitions.</p> <p>The select committee was clear that the fight to save libraries should not be all about buildings, because \"reductions in opening hours and the loss of professional staff may damage the service more than the closure of particular buildings, even though premises are clearly key to comprehensive provision\". It warned against the dangers of councils failing to support volunteer-run branches, saying that without help these libraries \"may well wither on the vine and therefore be viewed as closures by stealth\".</p> <p>The MPs also recommended that the government and the Arts Council help councils understand their \"comprehensive and efficient\" requirement. \"At the moment councils appear to be somewhat in the dark about what is expected of them and are making decisions which are being overturned by judicial review,\" said Whittingdale. \"This is an expensive, undemocratic and generally unsatisfactory way of making policy. Councils need to be given the support and advice they need to consult locally and develop a service that meets the needs of the local community and complies with their obligations.\"</p> <p>A further report, on the cumulative effects of the cuts, has been promised by the libraries minister by the end of 2014.</p> <p>Shadow culture minister Dan Jarvis called the report \"damning\", saying: \"[It] exposes a government that has no sense of the scale of the problem and has shown no leadership in forging a coherent vision for the future of the library service.</p> <p>\"Section after section refers to a lack of action or guidance from the secretary of state. Both on the subject of libraries under threat or being closed, or on what a 'comprehensive and efficient' service should look like.\"</p> <p>Campaigners, meanwhile, were concerned that the report didn't go far enough. \"Library users know public libraries are in crisis \u2013 not everywhere, but enough to threaten the whole concept of an accessible, expert service networked across the nation,\" said <a href=\"http://www.librarycampaign.com/\" title=\"\">The Library Campaign</a> in a statement. \"The committee sees the need to assess the 'cumulative effect' of all this. But it's happy to wait for the minister to tell it 'by the end of 2014'. That's too late. Irreversible damage has already been done. We dread to think how far things will have gone after two more years of vicious cuts.\"</p> <p>\"The report leaves the impression that the committee is sitting on the fence while the public library service continues to drift,\" said Desmond Clarke, campaigner and former Faber director. \"The report will not stop councils closing libraries for the wrong reasons.\"</p> <p>Mauger agreed. \"Change is so rapid that we may not recognise the public library service as we know it in a few years time,\" she said. \"We would like to see the suggested research and reports, especially from the secretary of state, brought forward to ensure that decisions that are happening clearly demonstrate consideration of the future needs of communities, families and learners. As the report says, short-term and ill-informed decisions could be hugely destructive to a public library service in the long term.\"</p>",

City have only one point from their opening three group games and are conscious that if other results go against them even victory in the final three would not be enough.</p> <p>On Friday Mancini admitted that last season he spoke to Monaco about becoming their manager, then on Saturday evening the 47-year-old said City were not yet equipped to win the Champions League. Asked to clarify these comments, Mancini interrupted and said: \"I don't understand why you continue to ask me about last month, last year. It's finished, so why? For which reason, why do you continue to ask me: 'Last year you had another chance to go.' I stay here because my work is here. I worked for two years. I built with the chairman, with the owner, this team. We won three trophies in two years. For 50 years we didn't win [the title, actually forty-four]. Never. Never.</p> <p>\"You should have respect for the people sometimes. I don't understand why you have to ask me this, why? You ask me one question, I'm polite because I answered your question and the other questions. I'm polite because I answer: 'It's true' [regarding Monaco]. Every year I can have two or three new situations where I can go, I want to stay here because I work hard. I am not saying the future will be easy but when you have a new team the strong work is the first two years and we have won three trophies.

  "<p>A Bradford bus driver should not have been sacked for being a member of the British National Party, the European court of human rights has ruled.</p> <p>Removing Arthur Redfearn, a BNP councillor, from his job transporting disabled passengers \u2013 most of whom were of Asian descent \u2013 breached his rights to freedom of association, the Strasbourg court declared.</p> <p>\"In a healthy democratic and pluralistic society, the right to freedom of association&#xa0;\u2026 must apply not only to people or associations whose views are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those whose views offend, shock or disturb,\" the judgment said.</p> <p>The decision, by a majority of four votes to three, was one of three cases in a single day in which the United Kingdom was found to have violated individuals' rights under the European convention on human rights.</p> <p>The ruling on Redfearn, who was 56 when dismissed in 2004 by his employer, Serco, noted that: \"Prior to his political affiliation becoming public knowledge, no complaints had been made against him by service users or by his colleagues.</p> <p>\"Nevertheless, once he was elected as a local councillor for the BNP and complaints were received from unions and employees, he was summarily dismissed without any apparent consideration being given to the possibility of transferring him to a non-customer-facing role.\"</p> <p>It added: \"It was incumbent on the [UK] to take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect employees, including those with less than one year's service, from dismissal on grounds of political opinion or affiliation.\"</p> <p>Redfearn had initially appealed against his sacking on the grounds that he was the victim of race discrimination. An employment tribunal had, however, dismissed his claim in 2005, finding that any discrimination against him had been on health and safety grounds.</p> <p>His continued employment, the tribunal had said, could cause considerable anxiety among Serco's passengers and their carers. There was consequently a risk that Serco's vehicles could come under attack from opponents of the BNP.</p> <p>Redfearn had been refused leave to take his case to the House of Lords but pursued it at Strasbourg.</p> <p>The dissenting ruling by three ECHR judges, including the UK judge Sir Nicolas Bratza, found there had not been a violation of Article 11 of the convention, the right to freedom of association. Redfearn had been working for less than a year and his employment rights, they argued, were not as extensive as those who had been working for the qualifying one year period.</p> <p>\"In a complex area of social and economic policy,\" the three judges observed, \"it is in our view pre-eminently for parliament to decide what areas require special protection in the field of employment and the consequent scope of any exception created to the general rule.\"</p> <p>In a separate case in Strasbourg, the UK was unanimously found to have discriminated against a Djibouti refugee, Hawa Aden Abdi, who was refused permission to join her husband in England.</p> <p>Abdii and Ilyas Elmi Hode, who have two children, married after he was granted asylum in the UK in 2006. The ECHR noted that UK immigration rules have since been amended.</p> <p>In a third judgment, the court found that the UK violated the rights to a fair trial within a reasonable time of a convicted murderer, William Beggs, 49, because his legal appeals had taken too long.</p> <p>In its ruling, the ECHR said: \"The appeal proceedings had lasted 10 years, three months and 21 days. Although the case was complex, this did not in itself justify appeal proceedings which lasted over 10 years.</p> <p>\"A substantial proportion of the delay had been caused by the applicant's own conduct. However, there were also periods of inactivity where the courts had failed to take steps to progress matters of their own motion, and this led the court to find a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time.\"</p> <p>Beggs was awarded \u20ac6,000 (\u00a34,820) in damages and costs. The decision against the UK on delay is highly unusual. As the court added: \"The vast majority of [delay] cases involved Ukraine, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Poland. There was only one finding of a violation in respect of the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>Audrey Williams, partner and discrimination law expert at global law firm Eversheds, commented:</p> <p>\"The government is likely to ask for the case to be referred to the Strasbourg court's grand chamber, to be re-examined by a full panel of 17 judges. It is not often that the grand chamber will agree to look again at an issue but it may well do so in this case given that Tuesday's decision was reached by the barest of majorities: of the 7 judges on the panel that considered the case, only four felt that UK law needs to change; the other three disagreed, saying our domestic law is fine as it is.</p> <p>\"If the grand chamber does not overrule today's decision, UK law will have to change to give employees with short service the right to claim unfair dismissal if they have been dismissed because of their political affiliation, for example because of BNP membership.</p> <p>\"At the moment only those with a year's service or more can bring such claims \u2013 or two years' service for those engaged after 5 April this year due to changes introduced recently by the government. Until the law is changed, private sector employees are unlikely to benefit from this ruling.\"</p> <p>A Department for Business Spokesperson said:</p> <p>\"While disappointed with the decision, we're pleased that the court has recognised the validity of a general qualifying period for the right to claim unfair dismissal. The court has also rightly recognised that a balance must be struck between the interests of employers and employees where these come into conflict due to an individual's political affiliation. The government will examine the detail of the judgment and decide on a way forward in due course.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain would be prepared to allow Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, to be given safe passage to a third country, it has emerged, as fears rise that a prolonged conflict will fuel extremism.</p> <p>In remarks released as David Cameron arrived in Saudi Arabia \u2013 a country that is a strong supporter of the Syrian opposition \u2013 the prime minister said he would agree to \"anything\" to see Assad removed from power.</p> <p>Britain is usually wary of allowing leaders accused of war crimes to be granted a safe haven on the grounds that they should face international justice. But Cameron, who indicated that Britain would not facilitate Assad's passage out of Syria, said he was determined to see Assad removed. There are fears that extremism will flourish if the conflict continues.</p> <p>Asked on al-Arabiya television what he would say if Assad demanded safe passage, the prime minister said: \"Done. Anything, anything to get that man out of the country and to have a safe transition in Syria.</p> <p>\"Of course, I would favour him facing the full force of international law and justice for what he's done. I am certainly not offering him an exit plan to Britain but if wants to leave, he could leave, that could be arranged.\"</p> <p>The Syrian conflict was expected to dominate the agenda on Tuesday when Cameron meets King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in Jeddah. The Saudis have been leading supporters of the rebels seeking to overthrow Assad.</p> <p>The prime minister, who spoke of \"appalling slaughter\" in Syria, reached out to his Saudi hosts by saying Britain was keen to support the opposition. For the moment this will stop short of offering arms.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"We must ask ourselves what more can we do? How can we help the opposition? How can we put the pressure on Assad? How can we work with partners in the region to turn this around?\"</p> <p>Asked whether Britain would help arm the rebels, he said: \"We are not currently planning to do that. We are a government under international law and we obey the law.</p> <p>\"My fear is, firstly, that the slaughter will continue, that the loss of life will continue. That should be our number one concern.\"</p> <p>The prime minister said extremism could flourish if the conflict were allowed to continue. He said: \"There is another fear, which is that the longer this goes on, the more that it can promote and drive extremism and we'll see instability in the region as well.\"</p> <p>Cameron, who will discuss Saudi Arabia's fears about the Iranian nuclear programme, will use the visit to press the king to place a second order for the Eurofighter Typhoon jets. Saudi Arabia has already acquired 72 of the aircraft.</p> <p>Britain is hoping to secure sales of an extra 100 Eurofighters across the Gulf. This would be worth \u00a36bn to British firms.</p> <p>At the end of Cameron's visit to the United Arab Emirates, a joint communique issued by the two countries said that the UAE and Britain planned to establish a defence and industrial partnership involving close co-operation around the Typhoon.</p> <p>The statement said the defence alliance would also collaborate on \"a number of new technologies\", but did not elaborate.</p> <p>Cameron promoted the Typhoon to Emirati ministers during his visit and his office and BAE officials have said the Emiratis have shown interest in ordering up to 60 of the aircraft. The two countries have also been discussing how to develop a \"strategic air defence relationship\".</p> <p>Tuesday's communique said the UAE and Britain would increase their joint military exercises and training. It pledged easier travel between the two countries, but gave no details.</p> <p>Cameron made an unapologetic defence of his three-day trip to the Gulf amid criticism from Amnesty International of a \"deeply disturbing tradeoff\" between trade and the promotion of rights. He said: \"When it comes to Saudi Arabia \u2026 this is a country that's very important for our prosperity but it's also important for our security too. As a full G20 member, we'll both be discussing Syria, Iran, other regional issues that are vital to the future security of the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>Downing Street is likely to point out that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, made an identical trip to Jeddah two days ago. France aggressively promotes its arms trade.</p>",

The damage done, particularly to our eldest child has been quite profound and long-lasting. Both children require a level of parenting over and above the average and much of it differs from traditional styles. Both Rob and I have had to try and unpick the ways we were parented and learn new methods and approaches. There have been dramatic struggles with schooling, friendships, anger, aggression and anxiety. But we have shared the most brilliant times, laughs, closeness and affection too. Our struggles have deepened our connections and solidified our bonds. And every day is a new day, every hour a new hour.<br>Although some adoption experiences are smooth and untroubled, generally adoption is not for those who seek an averagely easy and dependable life. Adoptive parents have to be prepared to go the extra mile, to continue to learn, to advocate, to challenge, to educate and to accept support now and again. I have been stretched and challenged in ways I never would have thought possible, but I would do it all again in a heartbeat. I am a better, more tolerant person than I once was and when I sit amongst my often noisy and chaotic family, I am proud of what we have all achieved.<br>My advice to anyone considering adoption is to go into it with your eyes wide open. Go to as many courses and training sessions as you can, read all the books, talk to adopters and think about whether you have space in your life for a child who is going to need all the time, energy and love that you have, and some. If you have then you may just find yourself on the most extraordinary, exhausting, life-enhancing and rewarding ride of your life. </p> </blockquote> <p> <br>And thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ermintrude2\" title=\"\">Ermintrude</a> for sharing <a href=\"http://t.co/CqLyokw5\" title=\"\">this audio by adoptee Paul Coxon</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Jules Birch's latest Inside Housing blog on <strong>welfare reform</strong>, and the further changes - including he bedroom tax and overall benefit cap - <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/home/blogs/april-is-the-cruellest-month/6524520.blog\" title=\"\">being introduced next April</a>. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Research so far into the impact of the 2011 changes (the bedroom caps and cut to 30th percentile) suggests that most tenants will look to make up rent shortfalls from elsewhere rather than move. The proportion moving out of the borough has been lower than expected so far, perhaps because transitional protection means the impact of the bedroom caps on existing claimants is only just being felt. However, staying put will become increasingly difficult as further cuts bite and larger families face the biggest shortfalls \u2013 and there is no transitional protection under the April 2013 cuts.<br>... Come April 2013, families will have three options: look for cheaper accommodation near to home or elsewhere; look for work of over 24 hours a week to avoid the benefit cap; or present as homeless to their local authority.

  "<p>You probably haven't heard much of Maurice Holmes, a little magician who turns the ball both ways. But Ricky Ponting has. Ponting first came across him in the indoor nets at Kent. And, like every other batsman facing Holmes for the first time, he had a little trouble telling the wrong'un from the right'un. \"I've never seen anything like that,\" Ponting said after they were done. The second time they met was in Sydney, when Holmes was playing grade cricket for St George. \"Oh,\" Ponting said when he saw Holmes standing at the far end of the nets. \"Not you again.\"</p> <p>Like a lot of us, Holmes first learned to play cricket with his brothers in the back garden. The difference between Maurice and you, me, and pretty much everyone else, was that he was a natural. He blessed with a talent that can't be taught, not for batting, or bowling fast, but for the most mercurial and elusive of skills \u2013 spinning the ball. And not just any old how. He was born with wrists that can bend in all sorts of different directions, and his shoulder blades, he has been told, are \"physiologically in the wrong place\". He started bowling off breaks with a cocked elbow and a curled wrist. Back then he couldn't have told you what he was doing, or how he did it, but Maurice had learned to bowl the doosra.</p> <p>\"It felt the most natural way to bowl,\" Holmes says. \"Using my wrist rather than my fingers, I didn't know anything much about what I was doing. As far as I knew there was a bloke in every village bowling like that.\"</p> <p>When he was 16, Holmes, who had never even played in a match of any sort, went along to his first net session at Tonbridge School. There, he caught the eye of coach Paul Parker, who had played a single Test for England in 1981. Parker put Holmes straight into Tonbridge's 'A' team, and a few weeks after that, the first XI. In the winter of 2008-09, at the indoor nets in Kent, Holmes bowled at Rob Key, who, as Maurice remembers it, was one of a bunch of batsmen who \"danced past a doosra\". Kent asked him to join their academy that same day.</p> <p>The World Twenty20 was in England the following summer, and Holmes had heard that their were opportunities for net bowlers up at the Oval. Soon he was bowling to New Zealand's batsmen. \"He rocked up,\" remembered coach Andy Moles, \"and the boys said 'Bloody hell, this is just like facing Murali.'\"</p> <p>New Zealand were so impressed that they took him up to Trent Bridge to help them prepare for their match against Sri Lanka in the Super Eights. A couple of months later Moles asked Holmes if he wanted to travel with the Test team to Sri Lanka to work as a net bowler, a chance he leapt at. Daniel Vettori was particularly impressed with the kid, and he and a couple of other senior players had asked the coaching staff to invite Holmes along. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/slvnz2009/content/story/419716.html\" title=\"\">He spent that tour working with Saqlain Mushtaq, who had been hired as a specialist coach, honing his bowling in the nets</a>.</p> <p>Back home in the early autumn, Holmes had some net sessions with England. Jon Trott and Ian Bell were so impressed by his bowling that they told Ashley Giles to invite him for a trial at Warwickshire. \"So I spent an hour or two bowling at them in the nets. And at the end of it I was offered a contract on the spot. That,\" he says, with a little understatement, \"was the end of a pretty amazing season.\"</p> <p>Like Parker, Moles, Key, and Vettori, Giles reckoned that in Holmes he had discovered an unpolished gem of a player. So, the question is, why haven't you heard more of Maurice Holmes, the English mystery spinner? The answer, sadly, is that despite his obvious talent, he has been hounded out of first-class cricket. Holmes spent this last season playing for Sevenoaks Vine CC in the Kent League; meanwhile he is studying for a law degree in Birmingham. He hasn't given up on cricket, yet, but he is beginning to feel as though the game has given up on him.</p> <p>\"There has always been talk about my action,\" Holmes says. \"It has followed me around, questions about whether it is legal, and how different it is.\" After that trial at Warwickshire in 2009 he went for his first biomechanical test at Loughborough. He failed it, and the contract offer was withdrawn. Undeterred, he decided to enrol at Loughborough University, reckoning it would be the best place to work on his action. \"Every morning, six days a week, I was bowling in the nets for two hours, while everyone else was recovering from their hangovers.\" He worked with Saqlain, and with the ECB spin coach Peter Such, and between them they ironed out the kinks in his action.</p> <p>Early in 2010 he got himself tested again, and passed. So Giles got back in touch and asked him to come and play for Warwickshire's second XI. He did so well that the club offered him a contract for 2011. He made his first team debut at the start of 2011, against Durham MCCU, and took a wicket with his very first ball. And then, soon after, he was reported again.</p> <p>Holmes failed his next test in Loughborough, not because the bend in his arm exceeded the 15 degree limit \u2013 it didn't \u2013 but because the analysts decided that his bowling was \"not match representative\". They were comparing his action with footage taken eight weeks before, and he had changed the way he gathered himself as he entered his bowling stride. The England and Wales Cricket Board made little attempt to examine the nuances of his case. They simply put out <a href=\"http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/about-ecb/media-releases/holmes-suspended-from-bowling,314888,EN.html\" title=\"\">a press release announcing that he had been suspended from county cricket</a>.</p> <p>The Professional Cricketers Association and the Warwickshire coach Dougie Brown stood by Holmes. They petitioned the ECB on his behalf, got him another test, and split the cost of it between them. This time, his off break was passed. But his doosra wasn't. Again, it wasn't because his arm was bending more than 15 degrees \u2013 it wasn't \u2013 but because the analysts decided that he was bowling it too slowly. They had clocked his fastest ball in a match, and wanted him to reproduce that speed with a doosra in the laboratory. He couldn't.</p> <p>So Maurice was \"warned\" against using the doosra in a match. He was actually told that the delivery was still legal, but that the authorities would be \"watching him very closely\" if he used it in a match. <a href=\"http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/about-ecb/media-releases/holmes,316059,EN.html?Pf=com.otherobjects.cms.model.structure.Folder-L-250\" title=\"\">Again, this nuance got lost along the way</a>.</p> <p>Since then, Maurice, still only 22, has pretty much been out on his own. He paid his way to go to the Global Cricket Academy in India, and has had a trial with Somerset and some interest from one or two other clubs, but his career has gone cold. Word has gone around the circuit that Holmes is a chucker, and the ECB have made no effort to correct or clarify the situation. A man with the rarest and most precious of talents has been frozen out of the game.</p> <p>Sometimes, it can be all too easy to criticise the ECB. But in this case the governing body has done an extremely poor job of nurturing a good young player, and their uneasiness about the situation was evident in the perfunctory, dismissive manner in which they respondd to enquiries about it. The Spin contacted Dr Mark King, the specialist who conducts the biomechanical tests at Loughborough, to try to clarify Holmes's situation. He referred us back to the ECB, who then provided a routine statement referring back to the rules and regulations. King has been subject to a little scrutiny recently. George Dobell, of Cricinfo, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/587767.html\" title=\"\">wrote an excellent piece on the testing being done at Loughborough</a>, explaining that the ICC do not currently recognise the results of tests conducted by the ECB.</p> <p>In the meantime, the career of an exceptionally talented cricketer has been completely derailed. Holmes worries that the ECB have been \"duplicitous\" by suggesting that he has been banned from using the doosra, when in fact he has only been warned about it. And of course, there has been no public explanation that when he bowls his doosra, and his off break, his arm is within the 15 degree limit stipulated by the ICC. \"I just think there has been a huge amount of misunderstanding,\" he says. \"Umpires don't understand my situation, and don't know it.\"</p> <p>If the ECB were serious about encouraging the development of doosra bowlers and other unorthodox spinners, they would surely have found a more sympathetic way to deal with Holmes that would have kept him in the game, and, at the very least, helped him fix any problems he has. But they haven't.</p> <p>In Australia national selector John Inverarity has said the decision about whether or not <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/story/588225.html\" title=\"\">the doosra should be taught to young bowlers is \"a question of integrity\"</a>, because he is not sure it can be bowled legally. Many people in England, it seems, would agree with him, though they haven't come out and said it. Holmes is not one of them. \"It is proven that you can bowl the doosra within the limits; that is a scientific fact, there is no morality about it. I have proven that I can bowl it within the limits.\" It feels as though a confederacy of conservatives is at work against him.</p> <p>\"There will always be the English view, that something different is not necessarily something good,\" Holmes says. \"There are people who tend to take the traditional view that things can and should only be done in one way.\"</p> <p>Maurice Holmes may not have gone on to be a great bowler. His is the hardest of arts to master. But right now he has not even had the chance to try, and it is not for any lack of effort or willingness on his part. The authorities have failed him. \"I would love to be bowling for a county and showing them what I can do,\" he says. \"I would love to be and representing the English game because as far as I know there is no one else out there who can bowl the doosra.\" And if his experience is anything to judge by, there never will be.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/signup/2010/mar/30/1\" title=\"\"><em>This is an extract from the Spin, the Guardian's free weekly cricket email.

This is a claim you've probably heard before many times, often stated as an indisputable fact rather than personal opinion. Given that you're currently reading the Guardian science section, it's reasonably safe to assume that you do not agree. People tend not to actively seek out things they find boring, unless it's for work or education purposes. And if this blog ever achieves the status of \"required reading\" for anything, the field of science is in deep trouble. </p> <p>Obviously those who are willing to blog about science don't find it boring, but I don't necessarily have any issue with those who do. A lot of science is not intuitive or is presented in <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/11/24/on-jargon-and-why-it-matters-in-science-writing/\">impenetrable language</a> for those not trained in it, and although a crucial element of education it's often presented in a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/primaryeducation/9146011/Half-of-children-find-science-and-maths-too-difficult-or-too-boring.html\">dry or overly challenging way.</a> Some of the fault can be attributed to individuals perhaps; just because understanding something is more challenging than you'd like is no reason to abandon it and write off the whole field as \"boring\". And the mainstream media \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/sep/08/badscience.research\">dumbing down</a>\" science stories in a way that can be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/may/01/neuroscience-fiction\">actively misleading</a> probably doesn't help. </p> <p>But it could be argued that scientists themselves are part of the problem. I've lost count of the number of lectures and talks I've gone to where the speaker makes no attempt to engage the audience or make the material in any way relevant. My remit for this blog is to try and make science stories/ideas amusing in some way. From comments I've been getting, some think even attempting this is a disgraceful abomination. Some seem to think you shouldn't write anything about science that you wouldn't be willing to have tattooed onto your own forehead, so seriously should you take the subject matter. Thanks to a receding hairline, I may have more forehead space than most, but I'm not going to be doing that. I'm saving it for advertising space for when I get desperate. But this furious response to any attempt to make science entertaining can't be helpful in promoting it, surely? Unless you're targeting the \"enjoys getting angry at things they don't really understand\" demographic, aka \"Twitter\". </p> <p>(Also, if you are one of the people who feel this way, you might want to stop reading now, you really won't like what's coming up.)</p> <p>However, it's fine to argue that science is not persistently boring, or not as boring as people think, but to imply that it's never boring is actually quite misleading. If we're talking people looking up things about science that they're interested in, then that's fair enough. But much of the \"science isn't boring\" bunch seems to be focussed on<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/may/01/neuroscience-fiction\"> schools,</a> encouraging children to choose a career in science. I've said this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/jul/31/what-is-science-google\">before</a>, but suggesting that science is all cool explosions and spectacular effects is going to lead to some disappointment. </p> <p>Fact is, working in science can be rather dull. It depends on the specific field of course, but most people would be hard pressed to argue that their science job is a non-stop roller-coaster of excitement. Any job will involve many mundane elements that have to be dealt with; this doesn't mean they're not interesting fields to be in. It just seems that with science, that's the only part many people are aware of. </p> <p>A personal anecdote (not that that <a href=\"http://osmosis-online.com/2010/01/09/seeing-is-not-always-believing-why-anecdotal-evidence-is-not-proof/\">constitutes evidence</a>, I know) demonstrates to me how boring some people find working in science. </p> <p>As is traditional when working in a laboratory, in the UK at least, <a href=\"http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=3255\">health and safety practice</a> is of paramount importance. Idle hands are said to be the devil's plaything, but idle hands with access to very dangerous, volatile substances make the devil wag his finger and make discouraging noises. For many people assigned to laboratory roles, it is required that you undergo basic safety training, such as <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/\">COSHH</a> (care of substances hazardous to health).</p> <p>When I started a new role in a busy lab, I had to go on a COSHH course. We covered preparing <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/fivesteps.htm\">risk assessments</a>. To facilitate this, whomever your company/institution purchases the chemicals from is legally required to include <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/basics/datasheets.htm\">chemical safety data sheets.</a> These sheets should list all the potential hazards presented by the chemical in question, what can happen in case of accidents, what to do about it in this scenario, and so on. We were given several different examples of these sheets.</p> <p>One of the sheets was for the chemical hydrochloric acid, <a href=\"http://www.reagent.co.uk/hydrochloric-acid\">HCl</a>. HCl is <br>produced naturally in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid\">human stomach</a>, to aid digestion. Much of the stomach lining is dedicated to <a href=\"http://health.howstuffworks.com/human-body/systems/digestive/question464.htm\">keeping the whole organ from degrading</a> as a result. A small amount of gastric acid entering the oesophagus can cause serious pain, <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146619.php\">heartburn</a>.</p> <p>HCl is very powerful stuff. If anyone argues that something is safe because it's \"natural\", they clearly haven't encountered it. A small whiff of it can be quite overwhelming, although it's a good way of dealing with excessive nostril hair. </p> <p>So, these safety sheets detailed what to do if you get it on your skin, eyes, swallow it and so forth. One was extra thorough and covered what to do if HCl is \"administered anally\". The precise details and consequences of such an occurrence listed lead to only one possible conclusion; this has actually happened to someone.</p> <p>HCl isn't generally available in pure form outside the laboratory environment. And even if somebody bizarrely interpreted a \"Lab coats must be worn\" instruction as meaning ONLY lab coats should be worn, someone leaving a narrow conical flask of HCl on the floor for them to fall onto is another unlikely occurrence. Both combined is astronomically improbable. Ergo, the most likely explanation is that someone experienced this \"administration\" deliberately. </p> <p>I don't care what the evidence says; it shouldn't be possible to be THAT bored! It can be tedious working in a lab on some monotonous task, but go for a coffee or a cigarette or something if it gets that bad. And if anyone feels I'm wrong to encourage caffeine or nicotine consumption because they're unhealthy, please remember the alternative in this context.</p> <p>There's nothing to confirm that whoever experienced this ultimate enema was actually a scientist or working in the scientific field, I just find it hard to imagine a scenario where they weren't, given the way HCl and labs work. I may be wrong about this. </p> <p>But I always think of this anecdote as a good example of how, even when boring, science produces some very attention-grabbing outcomes. Whether it be <a href=\"http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencecareers/2012/08/monkey-business.html\">drunkenly partying with lab monkeys,</a> or i<a href=\"http://www.drtribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=753:when-scientists-get-bored&amp;catid=16:life&amp;Itemid=182\">dly producing some bizarre but award-winning reports</a>, a bored scientist can still pique people's interest (albeit often inadvertently).</p> <p>Ergo, I'd argue that the mainstream tendency to assume that science and scientists are boring and need explaining in simple terms in order to make people want to hear about it is rather unfair. This logic isn't extended to other complex areas such as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19967194\">economics</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20207345\">politics</a>, so why does science get filtered in this way? As my friend and The Sky At Night team member<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20207345\"> Chris North</a> once pointed out, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where the latest <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/fixtures\">football fixtures</a> would include a very simple explanation of what the football actually is and how it works, for those who weren't interested in it. It's assumed that people already know this complex data. Unless it's about science. </p> <p>It's true that some find science boring, and that's OK, but can we stop assuming that <strong>everyone</strong> does? </p> <p>On the subject, do check out <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00zxmqd\">Dara O'Briain's Science Club</a>, tonight on BBC 2, which will hopefully demonstrate that science can be entertaining without losing the details.

  "<p>Co-operatives are a badly needed alternative to the austerity policies that are currently crippling the crisis-hit economies of Greece and southern Europe says the director of <a href=\"http://www.coopseurope.coop\" title=\"\">Co-operatives Europe</a>.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian at the end of the <a href=\"http:// www.manchester2012.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-ops United</a> conference in Manchester, Klaus Niederl\u00e4nder said: \"There is clearly an immediate role for co-ops in the Greece where we're seeing huge swathes of the Greek economy being sold off to the private sector at knockdown prices.</p> <p>Why not set up co-operatives that can be owned by the people themselves rather than external investors who just want to drain off the cash-flow?\"</p> <p>\"It's not going to solve all the problems in the Greek economy of course, but there is a great deal of evidence that points towards the co-operative enterprise business model as being of great benefit to the long-term recovery of the Greek economy.\"</p> <p>Whilst at the local level people in Greece are actively organising new co-ops that for example are directly linking consumers with farmers, this has yet to translate into a bigger, national movement.</p> <p>\"The main barrier to the Greek co-op sector is that the legal framework doesn't yet provide the support to enable growth on a national scale,\" says Niederl\u00e4nder.</p> <p>Whilst the grassroots co-operative movement in Greece is now focussing its efforts on getting a completely new law for Greek co-ops through parliament, Niederl\u00e4nder doubts that this new law will come any time soon.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately the Greek parliament doesn't have the best track record of developing legislation and getting it approved in a short time-frame.\"</p> <p>Further west in Spain the picture is one great regional variations says Niederl\u00e4nder, with the northern provinces of Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque country having strong co-operative sectors which have proved to be able to withstand the worst impact of the Spanish economic crisis.</p> <p>Niederl\u00e4nder cites the example of <a href=\"http://www.mondragon-corporation.com/ENG.aspx\" title=\"\">Mondragon</a>, the giant Basque co-op whose continued success has helped the Basque Country stem its unemployment rate to just half of that of the Spanish average.</p> <p>In Italy a recently published survey by the <a href=\"http://www.euricse.eu\" title=\"\">European Research Institute on Co-operative and Social Enterprises</a> provides more evidence of the ability of co-ops to outperform regular businesses in the face of an economic downturn.</p> <p>The survey found that between 2006 and 2010 co-operatives in the Trentino region of Italy outperformed shareholder companies in Bologna by a factor of almost three to one.</p> <p>The Trentino region of northern Italy has one of the most vibrant co-operative sectors in the country with co-ops making up 90% of the agricultural sector and 60% of the banking and financial services sectors.</p> <p>\"The strength of the co-operative banking sector in Trentino leads to banks collecting local money that is re-invested back into the local economy,\" says Niederl\u00e4nder.</p> <p>\"Crucially money isn't leaking outside the region and this is the secret of successful co-operative-based economies.\"</p> <p>Dan Gregory winner of the <a href=\"http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/cooperativealternative/essayprize.aspx\" title=\"\">Ethical Consumer 2012 essay prize</a> 'Is there a co-operative alternative to capitalism?' which was announced during Co-ops United, says that it's vital that policy makers are made aware of the strength of the co-operative model.</p> <p>\"Spanish co-operatives have seen an increase in employment by an average of over seven per cent in the last quarter of 2011 despite wider unemployment at record levels,\" says Gregory an advisor at <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Common Capital</a>, adding that: \"Co-operatives have higher resilience in economic crises.\"</p> <p><em>Simon Birch has been reporting from the Co-operatives United event in Manchester</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>I had no plans to change jobs this year and absolutely no intention of moving to a very different part of the sector. I started my career at the <a href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">University of Exeter</a> and stayed there throughout a period of growth and change, during which it moved firmly towards the top of the league tables.</p> <p>After a year on secondment at the <a href=\"http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/ges\" title=\"\">Government Economic Service</a>, I took up the role of head of the <a href=\"http://www.swan.ac.uk/business-economics-and-law/\" title=\"\">College of Business, Economics and Law</a> at Swansea University. I certainly hadn't ruled out a move to a different type of university as my career progressed, but nor did I see myself going into the independent sector. So how and why do I find myself at <a href=\"http://greenwich-college.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Greenwich School of Management</a> (GSoM) this autumn?</p> <p>After ignoring a number of messages and emails from the headhunters, I finally picked up the phone one afternoon and was persuaded to drop by when I was next in London. That happened to be on a sunny day, a couple of weeks later; I went there expecting to be unimpressed and to be able to draw a line under the approach and yet within an hour I had been completely blown away.</p> <p>I walked into a place that was full of lively students, that seemed well resourced and organised and that sat at the heart of the community. As an economist, I always try to make decisions rationally and I am confident I did so this time, but there's no doubt that I also felt a very strong emotional pull to GSoM.</p> <p>So, nearly two months in, how does it feel? I suspect that many people would look at the contrast between my previous roles in pre-92 universities, and GSoM, an independent provider with private equity behind it, and expect me to say it feels completely different. If so, you may be surprised; in many ways it actually feels incredibly familiar.</p> <p>We are busy, we have lots of students, we have a large number of faculty and professional service staff and we are all working together to deliver a great education and student experience \u2013 but then I could have said exactly the same thing when I was at Exeter. We offer programmes that are focused on employability, but then so do many other business schools. We make every effort to recruit a good number of students who will benefit from higher education, but then so does everyone else.</p> <p>Of course there are some differences; I have fewer full-time academic staff and less research going on. Some people would be surprised to know that we do research in the independent sector at all. However, amongst other things, we have a very good and growing PhD programme.</p> <p>We do nearly all of our teaching in small to medium sized classes \u2013 many of our students will have at least eight hours a week in classes of between 20 and 30, rather than large-scale lectures. And of course, a major advantage is that we do operate in a less bureaucratic, more nimble manner, which does allow for change and improvements to be put in place quickly.</p> <p>As anyone who has changed jobs will appreciate, first impressions are fine, but to really get to grips with a place, you do need to dig deeper. I'm not under any illusions, there are a number of challenges that I \u2013 and the whole of GSoM \u2013 face in achieving our long term aims. But as someone who has spent her career in higher education and more specifically in traditional universities, so far my only real surprise has been just how much these 'different' parts of the sector have in common.</p> <p><em>Professor Alison Wride is principal of Greenwich School of Management \u2013 follow her on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlisonWride\" title=\"\"><em>@AlisonWride</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>And so it goes on. Shakhtar Donetsk beat Metalurh Zaporizhzhya 2-0 on Saturday \u2013 Douglas Costa converted a penalty before a late goal from Luiz Adriano sealed it \u2013 to take their winning streak in the Ukrainian league to 23 games, 14 of them this season. They lead the table by 12 points and, already, with the season one game from its halfway point, it seems inconceivable that they will not lift a seventh title in nine years. The focus, understandably, is all on the Champions League and Wednesday's game against Chelsea.</p> <p>At the moment, Shakhtar are in a happy position. They can rest players domestically, essentially using those games as practice matches, clocking up the wins, building confidence, perhaps experimenting with tactical tweaks. Although the party line is to spout the usual platitudes about no easy games, the Armenian Henrikh Mkhitaryan let the truth slip when asked if he'd had to work \"really hard\" in the home game against Chelsea a fortnight ago. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"This is not the Ukrainian championship. When playing in the Champions League, you must move faster, close down the zones, orchestrate fast attacks. There are no weak opponents. All the teams are very strong. We must know how to defend, how to attack.\"</p> <p>The long-term prognosis, though, may be less positive. It's not easy for teams used to winning comfortably at home to then raise their level for the tougher battles of the Champions League. If an average game is won 3-0 or 4-0, they lose defensive focus, forget how to fight. Given their form \u2013 in all competitions the only game Shakhtar have not won this season was the 1-1 draw at Juventus \u2013 it seems absurd to criticise, but they have conceded soft goals against both Juve and Chelsea.</p> <p>In fact \u2013 and again, this feels like ludicrous nitpicking \u2013 their Champions League record this season should be even better than it is. Shakhtar have controlled all three matches, have created tons of chances, and yet their goal difference is only 5-2. They have been wasteful in front of goal in all three games \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/23/shakhtar-donetsk-chelsea-report-champions-league\" title=\"\">albeit against Chelsea in part because of a superb performance from Petr Cech</a>. Now perhaps that is coincidence \u2013 all teams have games in which they miss chances \u2013 but it may also be that Shakhtar lack a certain edge in front of goal.</p> <p>Some would blame Luiz Adriano, and it is true that his strength as a centre-forward is bringing others into play and creating space rather than finishing, but he is not the only one who's been profligate; it may be that when a team are used to creating a couple of dozen chances a game, a certain sloppiness can creep in. Shakhtar could really do with Dynamo Kyiv getting their act together soon.</p> <p>That, though, is the one small negative in what has otherwise been an utterly exceptional season for Shakhtar. The difference to last season, when they finished bottom of their Champions League group after a series of limp displays, could hardly be greater. \"Last year, if you remember, there were problems in the first game when the referee sent off two of our players,\" Mircea Lucescu, the manager, explained. \"Fernandinho wasn't fit. There were also other problems regarding the fitness of our players.</p> <p>\"Last year's exit from the group stage made us regroup, analysing once again everything we had been doing. By winning the championship, cup and Super Cup, we tried to make up for our exit from the Champions League. We won all these titles, and it gave us confidence. The level of this year's competition for first-team places has resulted in our players' improvement.\"</p> <p>Fernandinho's return from injury has been a major positive, partly because it allows Mkhitaryan to play further forward \u2013 in the position Jadson used to occupy \u2013 but also because he is the ideal player to link back and front of the team. Tomas Hubchsman sits deep to protect the back four and Fernandinho distributes while being willing to carry the ball forward and make the sort of runs that led to the second goal a fortnight ago.</p> <p>It was in the wide areas, though, that Shakhtar really hurt Chelsea. Roberto Di Matteo has spoken repeatedly this season of the need for \"balance\", of giving his creators freedom without losing defensive stability. In Donetsk, he left out Eden Hazard, playing Juan Mata on the left with Ramires on the right and Oscar central, but again his full-backs were left exposed.</p> <p>Ramires effectively cancelled out Razvan Rat in the first half \u2013 as he had Kwadwo Asamoah in the Juventus game \u2013 but on the left Mata may as well not have been there for all the attention Darijo Srna paid him. Mata is reasonably diligent about his defensive duties \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.soccer-blogger.com/2012/10/20/tottenham-vs-chelsea-2-4-highlights-cahill-sturridge-gallas-defoe-mata-goals-video-october-2012/\" title=\"\">see the way he robbed Kyle Walker before laying on Chelsea's fourth at Tottenham</a> \u2013 but he simply couldn't cope with Srna's energy as he bounded past him again and again. There seemed to be an attempt by Chelsea to meet fire with fire on that flank, particularly after half-time when Hazard came on, and Ashley Cole was far more attacking than Branislav Ivanovic. All that meant, though, was Alex Teixeira finding space or being able to isolate Cole.</p> <p>The other key to Shakhtar's domination in the first game was Mkhitaryan, who seemed to find it far easier to escape Mikel John Obi than Oscar did to get away from Hubschman at the other end. That perhaps lay behind the decision to substitute Frank Lampard and move Ramires into a holding role when Hazard was introduced. The Brazilian did, to an extent, check the surges of Fernandinho, but Mkhitaryan, one of those players with an enviable comprehension of where other players are, seemed always to find space.</p> <p>Chelsea's approach to Wednesday's game will be fascinating. Do they assume that with home advantage they will be able to impose themselves, knowing that if they can keep the ball in the final third Shakhtar are vulnerable? Or do they take measures to negate Shakhtar?</p> <p>It seems bizarre to discuss breaking up the Hazard-Oscar-Mata front three, or at least bringing in any one else but Ramires, but perhaps Ryan Bertrand could be deployed on the left to try to check Srna (or Ramires could play on that flank, as he did in the first leg against Barcelona). Will Mikel be able to cope with Mkhitaryan? And how will Ivanovic deal with Willian \u2013 by sitting deep or by attempting to bypass him by simply playing higher up the pitch?</p> <p>This is a vital game \u2013 for Chelsea particularly \u2013 but it is also a fascinating game tactically between two sides who essentially look to play the same way.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson took over as the Manchester United manager 26 years ago today. That number might not sound worthy of celebration, but the phrase \"26 years\" is burnt indelibly into the minds of United fans. For 26 years after the 1966-67 season, they waited for the club to be crowned league champions. </p> <p>Matt Busby, Wilf McGuinness, Frank O'Farrell, Tommy Docherty and Ron Atkinson all tried to bring the title back to Old Trafford, but it took the appointment of Ferguson to restore the club to their former glories. On the Sunday after Ferguson moved from Aberdeen to Manchester United, the Observer ran two pieces on the appointment. </p> <h2>Five men lost to one man's United by Frank McGhee</h2> <blockquote> <p>Frank McGhee, a sports journalist who had followed United for 36 years, recalled the club's turbulent past and explained why no manager had ever been able to emulate the success of Matt Busby. McGhee argued that each of his successors had lacked the \"arrogant ego\" required to dominate as dressing room and bring success to the club. As time has told, Ferguson has no worries in that department.</p> </blockquote> <p>The manager Manchester United really need, have desperately lacked and would love to have is unavailable and disqualified for one reason. He is 76 years old. But if they can't get Sir Matt Busby, it is obvious that they must look for someone with almost all that marvellous man's qualities \u2013 reaching for the lot would be asking for a bit much. </p> <p>The indications are that in Alex Ferguson they may have come fairly close to hitting the target, even though the most they can hope for is an inner rather than a bullseye. </p> <p>None of Ferguson's predecessors came anywhere near because, in one way or another, they all lacked at least one of those qualities and it may surprise those who don't know the man, even some of those who think they do, that the most important is the arrogant ego Busby so successfully concealed beneath layers of warmth, kindness, knowledge of and love for the game that perhaps even he didn't realise it was there. </p> <p>It was there right from the day in October, 1945, he decided he would accept the proper job as United manager \"only if they would let me have all my own way. As the manager I would want to be the boss.\" Shortly afterwards, the then chairman, James Gibson, a famous autocrat, suggested he should sign an available player from Newcastle United. Matt said \"no, he is not good for us\" and when the chairman, by then in an apoplectic rage, ordered the signing Matt said: \"I'll remind you of two things, Mr Chairman. I'm here to manage the club and part of management is giving you advice. The second is that I lived long before I ever saw you.\" </p> <p>James Gibson never interfered again, nor did any other director, particularly the one who leaned forward in the posh seats during a match and in loud-voiced ignorance asked Matt why he wasn't adopting different tactics. Matt caught up with him quietly in the gents, to advise with soft menace: \"Never dare say anything like that to me when other people can hear you.\" He then put on the agenda for the next board meeting the item \"interference by directors\". </p> <p>Has Alex Ferguson that sort of self-confidence? Ron Atkinson, for all his front-as-big-as-Blackpool, possibly hadn't. Busby would never have agreed to sell a player he wanted to keep and surely Atkinson must have wanted to keep Mark Hughes. </p> <p>Wilf McGuinness, the first successor, certainly didn't possess the required self-belief. He was the lance corporal who continued to call Busby \"boss\" and thereby unwittingly forfeited the respect of the other privates in the barrack room. Two men who could have had the job at around the same time, Jock Stein of Celtic, and Don Revie of Leeds, would never have committed a similar error. </p> <p>In fact, when Revie was asked by Jack Charlton how he wanted to be addressed after elevation from dressing room to manager's office he said: \"From now on it's boss, ok?\" Frank O'Farrell, the man who did get the job next, was a thoroughly decent, likeable and knowledgeable Irish Catholic, an extra qualification that incidentally did him no harm in the eyes of a devout left-footer, Busby. By the same token Matt would never favour a Catholic over a Hottentot if the other guy was a better player. The only man he required to hold a cross was his goalkeeper. Ferguson undoubtedly fits that requirement also. </p> <p>O'Farrell was, however, never in Busby's class as a manager of men, a motivator or a communicator. \"He came as a stranger and he left as a stranger,\" was the caustic comment of Denis Law, one of the quartet completed by Duncan Edwards, George Best and Bobby Charlton who rank as Matt's all-time favourites. </p> <p>Neither O'Farrell nor any other successor could match Busby in public relations. Most significant was O'Farrell's failure to cope with Best and, to set the record straight, Georgie never did anything wrong at Old Trafford under Busby without being punished and invariably apologising \u2013 before doing it again, of course. </p> <p>Matt was wise and warm but never soft. </p> <p>A sports reporter on the Manchester Evening News travelled just once in Matt and Manchester United's company on a trip to London in 1950 and watched in awe as great players of that era, Johnny Carey, Jack Rowley, Charlie Mitten, etc., walked around the manager in wide, wary circles. </p> <p>That same reporter, then on the Daily Mirror, didn't see him again for four years. It was outside Hampden Park, with thousands of strangers milling around, that Matt said instantly: \"Frank McGhee. How are ye son, good to see ye.\" He remembered with his uncanny knack of putting names to faces and in that moment captured an affection he has never lost. Respect, admiration and friendship all blossomed over many years. He had to hurt many players by dropping, selling and discarding them over those years but it provides its own tribute that so few ever resent it. </p> <p>It is unreasonable to expect any successor to have quite the same knack or anything like the deep love for United Busby shows, though undoubtedly Tommy Docherty will insist that he came as close as possible to matching it. But, for all his enthusiasm, bounce and near-genius for motivation, Tommy was, in show business terms, a talented lightweight patter comedian in the shadow of a great star of awesome magnitude. Still, at least Tommy always gave a convincing impersonation of being willing to seek advice from Matt. Pity he was always also destined to provide the source of his own downfall. He did a great deal for United, then threw it all away. </p> <p>At times he provided something like the football Busby had led Old Trafford fans to first expect and then demand. The next manager, Dave Sexton, unfortunately, didn't \u2013 even though Matt's hopes for him were initially the highest. \"Dave could be the one we've been waiting for,\" was Busby's own accolade at the time. </p> <p>It must be psychologically significant that in their 15-year search for a successor, the pendulum has swung so contrastingly. From the tail-wagging friendly puppy of McGuinness to the sober, serious O'Farrell. From Docherty's wisecracking ebullience to Sexton's simmering, brooding silences. Like O'Farrell before him, Dave's academy was the West Ham one, and for the Old Trafford school that meant too much blackboard, not enough jungle. </p> <p>Atkinson provided another contrast. As extroverted as Docherty, he never somehow struck the same accord as Tommy with the people who really own this club, no matter what the record in the directory of directors may say. The fans were never given by Atkinson what they see as their occasional right, the championship. Busby did it five times, came second seven times and that is what they have been seeking so hungrily ever since. That is what is required of Ferguson. He needs to be another Busby and maybe this chunk of newsprint will give him some idea of what is required. </p> <h2>The joker who hates defeat by Patrick Glenn</h2> <blockquote> <p>The second piece in the Observer on Sunday 8 November, 1986, was written by Patrick Glenn, a Scottish football writer who had tracked the young manager's career north of the border. Glenn's experience of Ferguson showed that the manager had the competitive desire required to handle his new job \u2013 and his final sentence about the silence at Old Trafford has proved oddly prescient.</p> </blockquote> <p>When Martin Edwards offered Alex Ferguson the Manchester United job last Thursday, it was as if the Big Fisherman himself had held out the key to the Pearly Gates. The very idea of Ferguson's non-acceptance was absurd. </p> <p>His irresistible competitiveness \u2013&#xa0;at times, it borders on the psychopathic \u2013 has long been sustained by apparently endless energy, and to have refused the biggest club in Britain would have seemed to Ferguson a self-betrayal deserving of hara-kiri. </p> <p>Now, he can leave the ceremonial sword in its sheath and get on with giving players, journalists, cleaners, directors, tea ladies, secretaries and all who come and go at football grounds a mixture of hard times, merciless ribbing, perhaps the formation of a quiz league embracing every subject possible and, most importantly, the unmistakable impression that here is a man who knows the most direct route towards his destiny. </p> <p>Ferguson's unshakable commitment to whatever cause he espouses has been evident since, as a teenager, he led his fellow apprentice toolmakers' industrial action at their factory on the south side of Glasgow. Later, he would become chairman of the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association. </p> <p>He is an almost inconsolable loser, whether in football, his beloved quizzes or in life itself. In his earliest days as manager of St Mirren, still in the Scottish first division, he took his team to Clydebank to face his closest rivals in the chase for promotion to the premier division. It was a complete sell-out and, when Saints went 2-0 down, Fergie could be seen leaping from the dugout in a clear attempt at throttling the linesman nearest to him. It was Christmas Day. </p> <p>Scotland manager Andy Roxburgh swears that Ferguson has not forgiven him his lapse almost 20 years ago during a round of 'Quiz Ball,' a popular television game for football clubs at the time. They were both on the Falkirk side and Roxburgh was asked which jockey had won the previous year's Grand National. </p> <p>Totally ignorant of horseracing, he became more nervous as he heard Fergie stage-whispering and trying to throw pieces of paper his way. Desperately, he blurted out \"Lester Piggott\", crediting the world's greatest flat jockey with victory in the world's most famous steeplechase. From the other end of the table, he heard Ferguson groan loudly, \"Aw, Jeeesus Christ!\"</p> <p>On the Saturday Falkirk had a League match at Brockville and as Roxburgh took the field \u2013 and here, he is convinced Alex had actually used a loud hailer to organise the fans \u2013 the entire crowd in the covered enclosure rose at once and chanted, \"Les-ter Pig-gott, Les-ter Pig-gott\". </p> <p>As St Mirren manager, Ferguson used a van with a loud hailer to tour the working class areas of Paisley, exhorting people to come to matches. When he took over at Love Street, after just months experience with East Stirling, crowds were down to less than 1,000. When be left, 10,000 was commonplace, not counting matches against Celtic and Rangers. </p> <p>Nobody with his sense of urgency could accomplish what he has without littering his trail with incident and controversy. Tales of flying tea-sets in dressing rooms at half-time are both plentiful and authentic. He has been known to batter on a referee's door during the interval of a match with his team leading 3-0 and on the way to clinching the league championship. </p> <p>But for all the volatile aggressiveness, he is an incurable joker. During Scotland's World Cup preparations in Santa Fe, New Mexico, he discovered an attractive lounge with a beautiful, white grand piano. He asked the manager about it and was told that it played automatically. For a fee, they could arrange to make it look as though he was playing. </p> <p>The deal was done and that night Fergie took the entire backroom staff out to dinner. When he offered to play the piano (\"I'll admit it's been some time,\" he said) the disbelief was obvious. But, with every action exaggerated, it came out as pure Semprini. </p> <p>Teddy Scott, Fergie's colleague at Aberdeen, couldn't recover. \"I thought I knew everything,\" said Teddy. \"During his time with us, he has told me everything, described in detail every daft goal he ever scored and all the easy chances he ever missed. He never keeps quiet, but I never knew he could play the piano.\"</p> <p>Now he will be playing to one of the most demanding audiences in the game and that will make him totally satisfied. Despite his semi-love of Aberdeen FC, he was never at one with fans who, he would say \"sit on their hands\". Alluding to a woeful lack of vociferous support during a big European match one night, he said: \"There was more noise at my granny's funeral.\" </p> <p>With him at Old Trafford, silence will be a golden rarity. </p> <h2>Aiming for the championship</h2> <p>Ferguson began his career at United with a 2-0 defeat at Oxford United and a goalless draw at newly promoted Norwich City. His first win came at Old Trafford against QPR on November 22, 1986. In <a href=\"http://twitter.yfrog.com/z/h0rasihj\">his programme notes before that game</a> Ferguson wrote: \"Taking over a club of the magnitude of Manchester United is an awesome prospect. But ultimately a football club is a football club and I shall simply try to run things at Old Trafford in what I believe to be the right way.</p> <p>\"I am not really interested in what has happened here in the past. I don't mean any disrespect to the great achievements of Manchester United over the years. It's simply that now there is only one way to go, and that is forward. The aim at this club must clearly be to win the championship.\" </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/845j6zfRHz8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/845j6zfRHz8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/series/fromthevault\">Read other stories from the Vault</a> and share your memories Alex Ferguson's time at Manchester United below</h2>",

  "<p>One of the <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/\">UK Independence Party</a>'s (Ukip) popular battle cries in recent years has been its condemnation of the European parliament wasting taxpayers' money on its bureaucrats and pet projects. It's a political strategy that has, in part, helped it to steadily improve its poll rating.</p> <p>But, following a rather frustrating exchange of emails with the party, I would argue that Ukip has its own questions to answer over its use of taxpayers' money on its officials and pet causes.</p> <p>The story started back in September when I spotted an intriguing detail on the latest \"<a href=\"http://www.ukipmeps.org/mypage_16_TR.html\">transparency report</a>\" registered by <a href=\"http://www.godfreybloommep.co.uk/\">Godfrey Bloom</a>, the Ukip MEP for Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire who is currently running for police commissioner of Humberside Police. It stated (<a href=\"http://www.ukipmeps.org/uploads/file/Bloom%20Jul-Dec%202011.pdf\">pdf</a>) that, up to at least December 2011, he had two part-time researchers working for him. They were described as a \"climate and environment researcher\" and a \"religious and confidential researcher\".</p> <p>Bloom is known for his climate scepticism and hostility towards wind turbines, but it was a surprise to me to learn that he had a dedicated, part-time researcher working for him on such issues. Given that Bloom is not UKIP's official environment spokesman (that honour fell to Lord Monckton until earlier this year when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/jun/22/rio-20-summit-final-day-live-blog#block-13\">he was replaced</a> by <a href=\"http://www.ukipmeps.org/news_608_UKIP-launches-new-energy-policy.html\">Roger Helmer</a>), what did this researcher actually do? And how much was he/she paid?</p> <p>So, on 28 September, I emailed Gawain Towler, Ukip's press spokesman:</p> <blockquote> <p>Please can you help me with this query? I notice on Godfrey Bloom's transparency documents held on the EFD Group website that he has had a part-time \"climate and environment researcher\" since 2009. Please can you tell me who this researcher is and how much they are paid out of EFD Group/EU parliament funding?</p> </blockquote> <p>(N.B. \"EFD\" stands for <a href=\"http://www.efdgroup.eu/\">Europe of Freedom and Democracy</a>, the political group that Ukip MEPs belong to in the EU parliament.)</p> <p>A few hours later I received an email directly from Ben Pile, who runs the anti-environmentalism <a href=\"http://www.climate-resistance.org/\">Climate Resistance blog</a> and who <a href=\"http://www.spiked-online.com/site/article/12737/\">writes on occasion for Spiked</a>, as well as convening a Spiked-partnered \"<a href=\"http://www.oxfordsalon.org.uk/\">salon</a>\" in Oxford: </p> <blockquote> <p>Hi Leo, I'm pretty sure you knew already! FYI.</p> <p>Salary 2009 - Jul 2010: \u00a3700/month.<br>Salary Jul 2010 - Aug 2011: \u00a326.4kpa.<br>Since Summer 2011, I have been contracted, rather than salaried to work for Godfrey Bloom/EFD. Works out at about \u00a32,000/month including expenses +/- other projects.</p> <p>Have a good weekend. Ben</p> </blockquote> <p>This surprised me to some extent: both to learn the identity of the researcher, as well as the sums he was receiving for his part-time research role.</p> <p>As Pile alluded to, I knew he had done some previous work with Bloom and EFD (making an anti-wind turbine film called <a href=\"http://www.europesillwind.org/\">Europe's Ill Wind</a> in 2010 via his company called Polimedia Ltd; he also <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/content/video-zone/2459-wind-turbines-and-the-countryside-blight\">made a speech</a> at the Ukip conference in 2011), but I didn't realise he had been Bloom's part-time researcher over such a long period.</p> <p>I replied to Pile and Towler:</p> <blockquote> <p>Thanks. Actually, I didn't know for sure. I just happened to notice that it said \"climate and environment researcher\" on that register and was curious to know who it was. Yes, I had a pretty good hunch it might be you as you had made that wind video for Godfrey a while back, but nice to have it confirmed. What does Godfrey get for \u00a32000 a month then? That suggests to me quite a bit of work?</p> </blockquote> <p>Towler then emailed:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think, Ben can correct me, that this is from Godfrey's secretarial/research allowance rather than direct from EFD funds.</p> </blockquote> <p>I replied:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yes, it would be good to have that confirmed one way or other.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then Pile replied:</p> <blockquote> <p>Facts, figures, and the such like. (Except, as an independent researcher I'm not involved in campaigning). Exactly the same sort of thing that any junior researcher provides to any politician for the same amount of money. Actually, Brussels-based political researchers (for all parties) get paid a lot more, such are the benefits of working in the EU. What's your interest here?</p> </blockquote> <p>I then replied to Pile and Towler:</p> <blockquote> <p>Thanks for the extra info. At the moment, I'm just at the \"curious\" stage, having seen that listing on Godfrey Bloom's register. But I will come back to you if I have any more queries.</p> </blockquote> <p>(I also asked Towler to explain who the \"religious and confidential\" researcher was, how much they were paid, and what precisely they did. He said it was someone called Father Eric Richards who \"does lots of interfaith work\". Beyond that he didn't know, especially regarding the reference to \"confidential\". I also asked Towler to confirm if that Eric Richards was the same Eric Richards listed as the treasurer of the <a href=\"http://www.eurfreedom.org/site-page/board\">European Foundation for Freedom</a>? But I didn't get a response.)</p> <p>But then I started thinking more about that \u00a32,000-a-month figure quoted to me by Pile. On reflection, it seemed like a rather large sum, especially given that Bloom is not the party's spokesperson for this subject. (The median salary in the UK for a full-time worker in 2011 was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2011/nov/23/uk-household-earnings-fall\">\u00a326,244</a>.) I looked at Bloom's website to see what activity within the topics of \"climate and environment\" he'd had pursued since 2009. I found a handful of amateurish YouTube videos (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q862zZYNzVo&amp;feature=plcp\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbNd045fA1E&amp;feature=plcp\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM1WTRqdEkg&amp;feature=plcp\">here</a>) from around the time of the Copenhagen summit in late 2009 with Bloom attacking climate science, but nothing that he couldn't easily have filmed himself and uploaded. He has, on occasion, <a href=\"http://blog.godfreybloommep.co.uk/\">posted on his blog</a> about climate change, carbon \"scammers\", wind farms and the like. There was the <a href=\"http://blog.godfreybloommep.co.uk/index.php/debates-a-speeches\">odd outburst or speech</a> in the European parliament, but again, nothing that seemed to justify a researcher being paid such sums on a monthly basis. And, to further confuse matters, there seemed to be a noticeable reduction in proclamations by Bloom on climate or environmental issues from early 2010 onwards \u2013 just at the time when Pile said he was paid more by Bloom.</p> <p>So I emailed Pile again:</p> <blockquote> <p>Ben, actually maybe you can help me with something. I'm struggling to see what Godfrey Bloom has done re: climate/environment beyond a few (old) Youtube videos around Copenhagen conf period that are on his website and a couple of equally old speeches in parliament. He says he is a \"substitute member on the Environment Committee\". Materially, what does that involve week to week? Can you spell out precisely what he/you have done since early 2010 that would explain the \u00a32k a month fee you mentioned as his researcher on this topic?</p> </blockquote> <p>He then replied to me and Towler:</p> <blockquote> <p>Leo. Sorry, I don't have time to retrace 33 months of my activity for you, nor do I need to justify my pay to you.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, that was that. But then a quick Google search threw up some more intrigue. Documents submitted last May by Ukip to a <a href=\"http://www.northdevon.gov.uk/index/lgcl_planning/lgcl_planning_applications/nonlgcl_devon_wind_farm_appeals_timetable.htm\">public inquiry held by North Devon Council</a> into the building of a wind farm at Batsworthy Cross showed that Pile had appeared \"on behalf\" of Ukip. The documents (<a href=\"http://www.northdevon.gov.uk/43272_apsn_poe_pile_ukip_environment.pdf\">pdf</a>) introduced Pile:</p> <blockquote> <p>Ben Pile is an independent researcher and writer. He is contracted to provide research for the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group in the European Parliament on climate and energy matters. He appears on behalf of Godfrey Bloom MEP and Paul Nuttall MEP, who are member/substitute member respectively of the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Food Safety and Public Health. He has a BA in Politics and Philosophy from the University of York.</p> </blockquote> <p>This threw up even more questions. Why was Pile \"appearing on behalf\" of Bloom and Nuttall? Why were Bloom and Nuttall getting involved in this local planning issue, when neither of them represent north Devon? Does Pile work for Bloom, or for the EFD? Are MEP researchers allowed to get involved in local party issues in this way?</p> <p>I decided to contact the European parliament to check what the precise rules were governing MEP researchers. I would like to say that this cleared the fog, but it didn't.</p> <p>After much asking around, I finally located the officials who oversaw the rules governing the use of, and payment of, researchers by MEPs. The issue was deemed sensitive enough that I was offered only an off-the-record briefing, which, in itself, seemed somewhat ludicrous given how simple my questions were.</p> <p>Either way, I was pointed towards the \"<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:159:0001:01:EN:HTML\">rules</a>\" governing MEP assistants:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Chapter 5, Article 33</em><br>Defrayal of parliamentary assistance expenses<br>1. Members shall be entitled to assistance from personal staff whom they may freely choose. Parliament shall defray expenses actually incurred and arising wholly and exclusively from the employment of one or more assistants or the use of service providers in accordance with these implementing measures and the conditions laid down by the Bureau.<br>2. Only expenses for assistance which is necessary and directly linked to the exercise of a Member's parliamentary mandate may be defrayed. Expenses linked to a Member's private life may on no account be defrayed.<br>3. Expenses shall be defrayable for the duration of a Member's term of office.<br>4. The maximum monthly amount defrayable in respect of all the personal staff referred to in Article 34 shall be EUR 17,540.</p> </blockquote> <p>Separately, I was directed to the rules governing how political groups receive funding directly from the parliamentary budget (the so-called \"appropriations from budget 400\") which cover the \"administrative and operational expenditure of the political groups/ non-attached member's secretariat\". I was told such funding cannot be used for:</p> <blockquote> <p>* expenditure already covered by other items under the EP budget<br>* financing of any form of European, national, regional or local electoral campaign;<br>* acquisition of immovable property;<br>* financing political parties at European level<br>* acquisition of financial participation or ownership in any other organisation.</p> </blockquote> <p>I then asked who I needed to check with to see whether the use and payment of Pile fell within all these rules. I was told: \"In principle, it would be for the financial services of Parliament and ultimately OLAF [<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/\">the European anti-fraud office</a>] and national authorities to establish that.\"</p> <p>I didn't see that it was necessary to escalate it to that level. I just wanted a simple steer on whether this was all within the rules or not as they seem so open to interpretation. After some more back and forth, I was directed to put my questions to the secretary-general of the EFD Group, as they were the ones signing off Bloom's researcher payments. That struck me as a somewhat biased source for guidance, given that EFD are, in part, one of the parties I'm actually seeking answers about, but I duly sent off an email on 10 October. In particular, I asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>Is such a representation [at the north Devon inquiry] within the rules of an MEP's researcher? Does Mr Pile's activities fall within Chapter 5 of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, as well as the rules on the use of appropriations from budget item 400? As secretary general of the EFD Group, please can you explain your group's rules and procedures for policing the activities and payments to MEP's staff. What is your own understanding of how Mr Bloom justifies paying Mr Pile \u00a32,000 a month? Please can you investigate this matter for me?</p> </blockquote> <p>The following day I received an email from Lynda Roughley, Godfrey Bloom's <a href=\"http://www.godfreybloommep.co.uk/staff.htm\">personal press officer</a>, who had presumably been forwarded my request by EFD:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr Piles (sic) is legitimately employed as a service provider to Godfrey Bloom, who is happy with the great work he does. Mr Piles represented Mr Bloom at the public meeting in Devon regarding wind farms as unfortunately Mr Bloom was unable to attend.</p> </blockquote> <p>A few minutes later she emailed a \"further comment for clarification\":</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr Piles is not employed as a parliamentary assistant, nor is he employed by the EFD Group.</p> </blockquote> <p>As before, this seemed to raise more questions than it answered. I replied:</p> <blockquote> <p>So who is paying Mr Pile for his contracted work? Mr Bloom out of his own personal pocket? What has happened in the two weeks since Mr Pile emailed me? Has his contract work been terminated? Or is there some other explanation? Why was Mr Bloom planning to attend this local public hearing in Devon, when that is not within his MEP constituency of Yorkshire and the Humber?</p> </blockquote> <p>I received no response. I asked again the following day, but also received no response.</p> <p>(N.B. In the past week, Pile has released a <a href=\"http://www.losthorizons.org/\">new anti-wind video</a> that he \"produced and directed\". It is described in the end titles as a \"Polimedia Production for EFD\" and the credits \"give thanks\" to, among others, Godfrey Bloom. It is \"written and presented\" by Steve Crowther, Ukip's chairman and the person who called Pile to appear at the North Devon public inquiry \"on behalf\" of Bloom.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, I had asked the press spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/envi/home.html\">EU parliament's environment committee</a> what involvement Bloom had as a \"substitute member\". Perhaps this could help explain the sums being paid each month to Pile if this provided Bloom with a heavy workload? The spokesman responded:</p> <blockquote> <p>I've been working for the environment committee the last 2 and a half years. I don't recall ever seeing him at a committee meeting debate or vote in that time. He has also not been a rapporteur or shadow rapporteur for any environment committee files as far as I know. (The committee appoints a \"rapporteur\" - aka draftsman - for each piece of draft legislation and the different political groupings appoint a 'shadow' to negotiate amendments to the texts.)<br> <br>The distinction between a member and substitute member isn't always very clear. There are MEPs who are have full \"member\" status on a committee but are basically inactive (e.g. because they are fully devoted elsewhere). There are MEPs who are \"substitutes\" but very active. So for a fuller picture you might find it helpful to check what Mr Bloom's activities are across the committees he sits on as a member (economic affairs and women's rights).<br> <br>From <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28513/Godfrey_BLOOM.html\">his profile page</a>, there are links to his \"parliamentary activities\":</p> </blockquote> <p>I looked at that link \u2013 and on <a href=\"http://www.votewatch.eu/en/godfrey-bloom.html\">this link</a> which shows his voting record \u2013 and I still can't see how his parliamentary activity justifies a dedicated climate and environment researcher, let alone one paid such sums.<br> <br>As one last throw of the dice, I contacted <a href=\"http://www.newton-dunn.com/\">Bill Newton Dunn</a>, the Liberal Democrat MEP who was, until recently, one of the EU parliament's five elected \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaestor_%28European_Parliament%29\">quaestors</a>\" \u2013 MEPs who are \"responsible for administrative and financial matters directly concerning members\". He recommended I contact <a href=\"http://www.jimhiggins.ie/ep/\">Jim Higgins</a>, the Irish MEP who was recently elected to the role of quaestor. But three weeks later - after an email, a follow-up email, and several phone-calls to his office in Brussels - I have heard nothing other than a confirmation from his staff that Higgins had received my original email. Yet again, it's like wringing water from a stone.</p> <p>I feel that neither Ukip, the EFD, or even the European parliament, have displayed the transparency you might hope for when faced with a seemingly simple question about how they are spending taxpayers' money. And I have only looked at this one case because it happened to catch my eye. There are 754 MEPs, all of whom, it seems, are entitled to spend Euros 17,540 a month (?!) on \"personal staff\", including researchers. Just don't ask any questions about how that money is actually being spent\u2026</p>",
  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer has reported a drop in first-half profits for the second year in a row after it paid the price for missing key fashion trends in womenswear earlier in the year.</p> <p>It has since made a string of senior appointments to its clothing business with the chief executive, Marc Bolland, promising that next year M&amp;S clothing ranges would become \"much more stylish and more trend driven\". It had remedied housekeeping issues that in previous quarters resulted in major shortages of bestselling products including coats, knitwear and shoes, with Bolland stating: \"We took steps to address the short term issues in general merchandise and as a result we delivered an improved performance.\"</p> <p>Pre-tax profits at the retailer fell 10% to \u00a3289.5m in the six months to 29 September, which was ahead of City expectations of \u00a3280m. There were also signs that the retailer had regained control of its misfiring clothing business with like-for-like general merchandise sales down 1.8% in the second quarter compared with the near 7% slump recorded in the previous period. Like-for-like sales at its food division rose 1.6%.</p> <p>Bolland had previously admitted it had failed to buy products featured in its advertising campaigns in sufficient volumes. It had not repeated the mistake, he said, with the retailer buying five times as many of the advertised lines as last year to avoid disappointing shoppers. It had also backed key fashion trends with more confidence, with the retailer already shifting 44,000 military-style coats.</p> <p>The problems within its general merchandise business came to a head with the recent departure of clothing supremo Kate Bostock. Her departure has triggered a reshuffle including the promotion of food boss John Dixon as her replacement. M&amp;S has also drafted in former Debenhams chief executive Belinda Earl as style director and Janie Schaffer from US chain Victoria's Secret to head up lingerie, freeing up current lingerie boss Frances Russell to lead the high profile womenswear division.</p> <p>Bolland said the fruits of the new team's work would not be seen until July, when the first autumn products start to arrive in store, as summer ranges have already been bought by their predecessors: \"You cannot expect them to make an impact on something that has already been bought,\" he said. \"We have to give them some time.\"</p> <p>Analysts at Singer Capital Markets said the figures suggested Marks was beginning to get back on track: \"M&amp;S has been dogged by ranging and buying issues over the last few quarters, part of which may have stemmed from management uncertainties and this update suggests they are taking control in this regard after securing a new team.\" In common with Next boss Lord Wolfson, Bolland said recent trading has been \"volatile\": \"This, coupled with continuing pressure on consumers' disposable incomes, makes us cautious about the outlook for the rest of this year. However, we are well set up for the Christmas trading period.\"</p> <p>M&amp;S's fortunes contrast with Primark which reported a 15% jump in operating profits to \u00a3356m for the year to 15 September. Like-for-like sales climbed 3% with owner Associated British Foods flagging strong trading in the UK particularly over the summer months and \"encouraging\" sales of its winter ranges in the new financial year.</p>",
  "<p>A Turkish court has launched the trial in absentia of four former Israeli military commanders over the deaths of nine Turkish activists on board a ship bound for Gaza in 2010.

It said the trial was \"merely a propaganda display. It would be in Turkey's interest to deal with this issue through bilateral dialogue.\"</p> <p>Since the incident, Turkey has demanded an apology and compensation for the victims' families from Israel. Israel has expressed regret over the deaths but has refused to apologise.</p> <p>The Mavi Marmara was part of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza-flotilla\" title=\"\">flotilla of ships</a> attempting to breach Israel's blockade of Gaza. Israeli commandos stormed the flotilla in international waters, shooting dead nine activists.</p> <p>Erdogan described the incident as \"state terrorism\". Israel said hardcore militants intent on a violent confrontation were among the Marmara's passengers.</p> <p>Relations between the two countries have never been repaired. After a UN report in September 2011 concluded that Israel's naval blockade of Gaza was justified but it had used \"excessive and unreasonable\" force, Turkey expelled Israel's ambassador.</p> <p>The four on trial are Ashkenazi; Eliezer Marom, former commander of the Israeli navy; Amos Yadlin, former commander of the air force; and Avishai Levy, former head of air force intelligence.</p> <p>The case would have a \"devastating effect on Turkish public opinion of Israel,\" said Alon Liel, a former Israeli envoy to Ankara. \"All participants in the flotilla have been invited to testify. The exposure will be catastrophic to relations.\"</p> <p>He said that \"three months of constant Israel-bashing\" during the trial would damage the chances of Israel apologising for the incident.</p> <p>Erdogan said last week that he planned to visit Gaza, although no date was specified. Following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/qatari-emir-welcome-gaza-visit\" title=\"\">visit last month by the Emir of Qatar</a>, the first head of state to visit the enclave, an official Turkish visit would be seen as further legitimisation of Hamas and an affront to the West Bank-based Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.</p> <p>According to Liel, a visit was possible because of the good relations between Erdogan and the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi. The Turkish prime minister would need Egypt's permission to cross the border into Gaza from the Sinai.</p> <p>An official Turkish visit would have \"enormous implications,\" he said. \"It would create a more positive image for Hamas in the moderate Arab world, and would be a blow to [Hamas rivals] Fatah, and to Israel.\"</p> <p>Turkey has been acclaimed in Gaza since the Mavi Marmara incident. A large monument stands on the quay of Gaza City's fishing port, and Turkish flags fly from buildings and lampposts throughout Gaza.</p>",
  "<p>Lemmy has sent an election message to the US, decrying the Republican presidential nominee as a \"fucking monster\". In <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lemmy-mitt-romney-is-a-monster-20121105\" title=\"\">an interview with Rolling Stone</a>, the Mot\u00f6rhead leader pleaded with Americans: \"Please, please don't vote for Mitt Romney. Fuck him. Repeal abortion law is the first thing he'll do.\"</p> <p>Lemmy is not famed for his political involvement, frequently denying any ideological motive behind his collection of Nazi memorabilia. However, he was steadfast in his view on the presidential race. He suggested the US had not been ready for an African-American president in the form of Barack Obama, \"because they're trying to drag him down now. I mean, the poor fucker's only just gotten rid of all that George Bush shit that he left, or is trying to. And he's being stonewalled by the fucking Congress all the time. I don't know how he's gotten anything done. They should be glad. I mean the alternative is Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>Lemmy had been speaking to Rolling Stone before a Chuck Berry tribute concert in Cleveland, Ohio, and proved he had lost none of his ability for a line that might best have been left unsaid. He said of Berry: \"I liked his attitude, talking to chicks, you know.\" In 1962, Berry was imprisoned for three years for transporting a minor across state lines for immoral purposes. In 1990, Berry settled out of court after being sued by several women for installing a video camera in the ladies' toilet at a restaurant he owned.</p>",
  "<p>Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, the partner of French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, was threatened with the axe from Paris Match, the glossy magazine where she has worked as a journalist, it has emerged.</p> <p>Paris Match's owner Arnaud Lagard\u00e8re said Trierweiler, who has launched several law suits against French magazines over alleged breaches of privacy, has caused him \"nothing but problems\" since Hollande was elected president in May.</p> <p>His comments emerged in a new biography about the publishing tycoon and come just weeks after Trierweiler attacked Paris Match for putting her picture on its front cover without informing her first.</p> <p>Extracts from the new book, The Heir Who Wanted to Live His Life, appeared <a href=\"http://www.marianne.net/Cette-semaine-dans-Marianne-Francois-Valerie-Segolene-Revelations-sur-un-trio-infernal_a221885.html\" title=\"\">in Marianne magazine</a> in France on Monday and cite Lagard\u00e8re saying he did not want to renew Trierweiler's contract when it expires at the end of the year. He described her as an \"unpinned grenade\" and said the magazine would be letting her go at the end of the year.</p> <p>Lagard\u00e8re, chairman and chief executive of Paris Match publisher Lagard\u00e8re Media, later changed his mind over not renewing Trierweiler's contract, agreeing to keep her on after Hollande assured him \"she isn't really a first lady\", according to the book.</p> <p>Trierweiler made her name as a political journalist but is now writing a literary column for Paris Match.</p> <p>Her relationship with the French press has been fractious ever since she became France's first lady. In September she said she was suing three glossy magazines \u2013 Closer, Voice and Public, for breach of privacy after they published photographs of the presidential couple in their swimsuits while holidaying at Fort de Br\u00e9gancon, a presidential retreat off France's southern coast.</p> <p>President Hollande lived with Marie-S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, a leading socialist politician and the mother of his four children, for 28 years before leaving her for Trierweiler in 2005.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Neil Heywood, the British businessman whose death sparked the downfall of former Chongqing party boss <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bo-xilai\" title=\"\">Bo Xilai</a>, knowingly provided information on the high-flying Chinese politician's family to MI6, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was convicted earlier this year of murdering the Briton last November. The court heard she had feared for her son's safety after a business dispute with Heywood \u2013 a claim his friends cast doubt upon. The 41-year-old had known the family since the 1990s, but relations had soured before his death.</p> <p>The Journal, citing current and former British officials and friends of Heywood, said the businessman <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204846304578090740894694144.html?mod=WSJUK_hpp_LEFTTopWhatNews\" title=\"\">continued to meet a contact and provide information on Bo's affairs after learning that the person was an MI6 officer</a>. His contact even warned him to be careful \"not to become a headline\" as his relations with Gu became tense.</p> <p>China closely guards information on the private lives of its leaders, which it regards as state secrets.</p> <p>Heywood was known to have carried out work for Hakluyt, the business intelligence firm set up by former MI6 officers, but following his death the foreign secretary, William Hague, issued a rare denial of intelligence links, saying Heywood was \"not an employee of the British government in any capacity\".</p> <p>A spokesman for the British embassy said of the latest claims: \"We do not comment on intelligence matters or allegations of intelligence matters.\"</p> <p>Friends of the businessman noted that the newspaper said Heywood was not paid and was never asked to seek specific information.</p> <p>They argued his overt fascination with James Bond \u2013 his silver Jaguar had a registration number containing 007 \u2013 was hardly the sign of a major intelligence asset.</p> <p>Heywood's death was initially ascribed to excessive alcohol consumption and his body was cremated without an autopsy, with his wife's approval. Concerns about his death were raised in January, but Britain did not ask China for an investigation until the following month, after former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun fled to the US consulate in Chengdu, where he told diplomats Gu had murdered Heywood. One source told the Journal that Wang claimed Gu confessed she \"killed a spy\".</p> <p>Asked about the report, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing said judicial authorities had already ruled on the Gu case. He added that China would handle the Bo case \"according to party discipline and national law\".</p> <p>Bo was once tipped for possible elevation to the politburo standing committee, China's top decision-making body, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/04/changing-of-the-chinese-old-guard\" title=\"\">this month's leadership transition</a>. But many think his prospects had faded even before the scandal surrounding Heywood's death.</p> <p>He now faces criminal charges, having been accused of offences including taking bribes and interfering in the murder investigation.</p>",
  "<p>The other day, I went to a brilliant event at Foyles. It was a YA crime panel and had three amazing authors there to talk to us - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/gregg-olsen\">Gregg Olsen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/christopher-ould\">Christopher Ould</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/niall-leonard\">Niall Leonard</a>. </p> <p>All three began writing for adults \u2013 Gregg doing real crime and fictional serial killer novels; Chris doing police dramas on TV and adult thrillers; Niall also doing police TV shows. And now all of them are branching into YA. Why?</p> <p>We all know YA literature has surges where certain genres become huge and really popular: lately, it's been magic, spies, vampires, angels and contemporary stories. So what could possibly be next? Personally, I think it's going to be crime.</p> <p>Well, I don't know about you, but I actually live for crime drama on TV \u2013 I can't get enough of CSI, NCIS and Law and Order. I've loved <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sherlock-holmes-the-movie\">Sherlock Holme</a>s for years, so when I was about twelve, I decided to give a crime thriller novel a go. It was a huge, huge mistake and left me a little mentally scarred. Adult fiction can be so hit and miss \u2013 especially for a 12-year-old! Some still leaves me sick to my stomach! You never really know whether the book you read will be just a good old-fashioned whodunnit or a completely twisted crime thriller about a serial killing sexual predator \u2013 with a little bit too much information for a very young teen!</p> <p>Now I'm older, I'm able to dip into the adult genres but I still think it's a huge gap in the market, what with crime being so big on screen. A few years ago, I would've given anything for a good crime-mystery book aimed at my age group that wasn't Edith Blyton or Nancy Drew.</p> <p>Finally, it seems my wishes are coming true! Many big publishers seem to have cottoned onto the fact that teens love crime, and are bringing out more books for us. Adult writers are dipping into teen fiction too, with huge names like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/harlan-coben\">Harlan Coben</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/search/results?query=Kathy+Reichs&amp;searchBy=author\">Kathy Reichs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/search/results?query=John+Grisham&amp;searchBy=author\">John Grisham</a> bringing out YA series of their own (speaking of, you must check out the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/search/results?query=Mickey+Bolitar&amp;searchBy=title\">Mickey Bolitar</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/search/results?query=Virals+&amp;searchBy=title\">Virals </a>and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/search/results?query=Theodore+Boone&amp;searchBy=title\">Theodore Boone </a>series \u2013 they're all brilliant!). </p> <p>And as I mentioned earlier, we have Gregg, Chris and Niall all bringing out books too. Gregg's series Empty Coffins is about two twin girls who solve deaths using psychic gifts \u2013 it also shows us lots of the police procedures and is so suspenseful and addictive! </p> <p>Chris's new book \u2013 which came out this month \u2013 is Street Duty: Knock Down, and is just so cool: a real life police drama with a 16-year-old girl police trainee. I can't wait for the next in the series! </p> <p>Finally Niall's book Crusher, which is a brilliant thriller about a boy whose dad was killed so he has to go seek answers and perhaps revenge\u2026 </p> <p>All of them have a very gritty feel \u2013 none treat teens in a patronising, you-don't-need-to-know-this way; all talk to us frankly and like we understand it all \u2013 which we obviously do. </p> <p>They're very much adult books that just have younger protagonists: that's really it, especially for Knock Down and Crusher: if they were to be written for adults, all you'd need to do is add a decade to the lead characters and that'd be that. I loved that about them.</p> <p>The question in my mind, however, is why now? Why are we seeing this spike in YA crime thrillers? Maybe adults are realising that we older teens aren't as fragile as they once thought we were. We know about all the bad things already, know they happen and what some people do. So why aren't we meant to read about it in a fictional book \u2013 why are we told \"Oh, you don't need to know about that yet\", even though we see it all on TV and in the news?</p> <p>Plus, what with teen crime becoming more common and the whole teens-wearing-hoodies-are-dangerous stereotype, these books with real life teens both committing and more importantly solving crimes are just so much more relevant and \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 actually necessary.</p> <p>But in the end, if I'm completely honest, I don't really care why criminals are the new vampires. I'm just too busy celebrating!</p> <p>If you know of any other YA crime books I should be reading, do let me know by emailing <a href=\"mailto:\" childrens.books@guardian.co.uk\"\">childrens.books@guardian.co.uk</a></p> <h2>Your suggestions</h2> <p><strong>Suz</strong><br>You may enjoy Barry Lyga's latest YA book I HUNT KILLERS - teen son of a serial killer in a town where bodies begin turning up... - and Libba Bray's newest called DIVINERS, a YA set in the 1920s, prohibition, party girls, and the paranormal with brutally detailed slaughters for the occult.</p> <p><strong>Julia</strong></p> <p>I really enjoyed your post on YA crime fiction and was happy to see that you mentioned 3 authors with whom I was unfamiliar. I'm currently in library school and put together a Noir literature website for my Young Adult Literature class. I included adult and teen titles, but my favorite YA novel in the list is You Killed Wesley Payne by Sean Beaudoin. Granted, noir and crime fiction are separate literary genres, but I feel there is often some overlap between them. Anyway, here's the website link if you'd like to see what else I found: http://courseweb.lis.illinois.edu/~jksmith3/NoirReader/index.html</p> <p>A couple other titles that didn't make the \"noir\" cut for me were Bullet Point by Peter Abrahams and Shelter by Harlan Coben.</p> <p><strong>Sarah</strong><br>Check out first-time novelist Beck McDowell's just released This Is Not a Drill:<br>http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13586765-this-is-not-a-drill</p> <p><strong>Stacey</strong><br>It just so happens Gregg Olsen blurbed COLD FURY by T.M. Goeglein and had this to say: \"Cold Fury is a white knuckle read that dares the reader to turn the next page. I loved it!\" COLD FURY is a thrilling teen mafia action adventure worth checking out.</p> <p><strong>Wicked Stepmomster</strong><br>Two cool YA crime books are books that are historical fiction/crime thrillers: Kiss Me I'm Dead and Confessions of a Teenage Body-snatcher. Both by T.K. Welsh. They were published by Dutton and then republished by the author. They're available on Amazon and I've bought half a dozen copies of each for nieces, nephews and more than one adult. Great books, chilling crime issues and wonderful main characters. I think you'll like them.</p> <p><strong>Jill</strong><br>BLIND SPOT by Laura Ellen is a murder mystery that keeps you guessing from page one! <br>http://nerdybookclub.wordpress.com/2012/10/31/blind-spot-by-laura-ellen-reviewed-by-brian-wyzlic/</p>",
  "<p>House prices fell for the fourth month running in October, dropping by 0.7% over the month, according to the latest figures from mortgage lender Halifax.</p> <p>The bank's latest house price index put the average cost of a home in the UK at \u00a3158,426, down \u00a34,500 on the price in October 2011 and \u00a341,000 lower than the peak of \u00a3199,612 in August 2007.</p> <p>According to the index, which calculates annual price changes using the average of three months' figures, values have fallen by 1.7% over the past 12 months \u2013 the highest annual change recorded since February.</p> <p>The three-month figures, which are generally a better indication of price trends than single monthly figures, showed a 1.2% fall. This is substantially higher than the 0.5% figure recorded in September.</p> <p>Halifax's chief economist, Martin Ellis, said the figures were \"signs of a modest deterioration in the trend in house prices\".</p> <p>He added: \"The weak economic background has been a key factor dampening housing demand this year.

  "<p>Theresa May is to make a statement to the House of Commons on the fresh investigation into the \"hugely shocking\" north Wales child abuse allegations linked to a senior Conservative.</p> <p>The home secretary said the investigation ordered by David Cameron would \"look very carefully\" into how the original inquiry assessed the allegations of sexual abuse at north Wales children's homes in the 1970s and 80s and make sure it was \"done properly\".</p> <p>May told the BBC that the new investigation, to be led by a \"senior independent figure\", would look at how the original inquiry by the high court judge Sir Ronald Waterhouse was conducted. Steve Messham, who claims he was abused by the Conservative politician, has said the 2000 report covered only a fraction of the alleged assaults.</p> <p>May struggled on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme to explain why the new inquiry was being set up, despite being repeatedly pressed on the issue: \"There is going to be a review of the Waterhouse review, looking at the way it was conducted. These issues are hugely shocking and we have to go back and have a review of that inquiry to make sure that it has done the job that it was supposed to do,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Given the nature of these concerns, given the background, given the appalling nature of child abuse, we need to look very carefully to make sure that what was done in the past did indeed cover everything it needed to do, and was done properly.\"</p> <p>The Waterhouse review ran to more than 1,000 pages and concluded that there was not sufficient evidence for the judge to be satisfied that the unnamed Conservative politician was involved.</p> <p>The home secretary said her Commons statement, scheduled for 12.30pm on Tuesday, would also address the question of extra support and resources for the North Wales police to work with the new inquiry.</p> <p>Faced by claims that senior Conservative politicians and other establishment figures may have been involved in the scandal \u2013 and a subsequent cover-up \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/05/cameron-inquiry-north-wales-sex-ring\" title=\"\">Cameron announced on Monday he would establish an urgent investigation</a> into the conduct of the Waterhouse inquiry, which was held between 1996 and 2000.</p> <p>The prime minister, who is on an official visit to the Middle East, said on Tuesday: \"These are very, very concerning allegations, they are dreadful allegations. We must get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible on behalf of the victims.</p> <p>\"That is why I have ordered this rapid investigation into the previous inquiry to find out whether there was something wrong with it and make sure the victims are properly listened to.</p> <p>\"Today the home secretary will be speaking to the House of Commons and making sure that the police have the capacity to deal with these allegations and make sure no stone is left unturned in getting to the bottom of these appalling matters.\"</p> <p>Cameron's spokesman in London said a separate inquiry was expected to be held into how North Wales police handled complaints at the time. That inquiry is likely to be conducted by the National Crime Agency.</p> <p>Up to five different inquiries are under way, or imminent, looking into various aspects of child abuse. But ministers feel they must be seen to be taking the allegations seriously, especially since the government has condemned the BBC over the Jimmy Savile allegations.</p> <p>There is also concern in government circles that victims' allegations about abuse were not taken seriously in the past, and that there must be a clear signal from the top of government that any culture of complacency is changing.</p> <p>Cameron has called on anyone who knew anything about the allegations of abuse to contact the police.</p> <p>He and the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, rushed to act as the media threatened to identify the senior Tory figure close to Lady Thatcher alleged to have been involved in the child abuse.</p> <p>The government said it was acting largely due to the allegations made by the BBC Newsnight programme on Friday night, and not due to the campaign launched by the Labour MP Tom Watson.</p> <p>On Newsnight, Messham said he had been abused by the senior Tory and said the claims had been \"swept under the carpet\". According to reports at the weekend, as many as three victims have named the Tory grandee as one of their abusers. Newsnight said at least one other victim of abuse in the homes said he was abused by the politician.</p> <p>Messham was due to meet the Welsh secretary, David Jones, on Tuesday.</p> <p>In an extraordinary letter to the prime minister, Watson praised Cameron for acting swiftly, but then made a series of further allegations about the extent of the cover-up in other police forces.</p> <p>\"It is certainly important that government departments trawl their archives to see what documents they hold,\" Watson said. \"But my experience of uncovering massive establishment conspiracies leaves me in no doubt that what you have suggested does not go anything like far enough. Its limited scope may even slow things down, muddy waters, damage trails. What is needed is a much wider, but equally immediate, investigation.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Since sharing my concerns with you at PMQs, a number of people have come forward to say that they raised their suspicions with the police, but investigations were not carried out. One allegation involves alleged child abuse and a former cabinet minister. We both know that many untruths are told about politicians, but this allegation was specific, informed and appeared well corroborated.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's spokesman insisted Cameron was \"very keen to ensure that everything is looked at properly and thoroughly and that no stone is left unturned\".</p> <p>Another alleged victim, Keith Gregory, claimed names of abusers were excised from the inquiry report, apart from individuals in the care homes, and that the culprits included \"MPs, solicitors, factory directors, shopkeepers, senior police officers. The list goes on\".</p> <p>The Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, said: \"The Welsh government takes these allegations very seriously but could I ask that in the first instance victims of abuse who feel the abuse they suffered was not investigated properly should report their cases to the police. My officials have been in touch with North Wales police regarding these matters.\"</p> <p>Jones said the Waterhouse inquiry had been extensive and many of its recommendations for improving child protection were implemented by the Welsh government.</p> <p>But he added: \"I have asked for urgent advice on the terms of reference of the Waterhouse inquiry. I want to fully understand what was included and what was not. That will enable me to consider whether any further inquiry will be necessary.\"</p> <p>Jones said he would meet the children's commissioner \u2013 a role set up following the inquiry \u2013 to \"hear his thoughts directly\".</p>",

They promised before the election that it is something that they took seriously \u2013 the prime minister made that promise \u2013 and nothing has happened. </p> <p>\"What local councils are showing is that there are definitely ways of promoting the living wage and getting contractors to pay the living wage, which are absolutely within EU law.\"</p> <p>Jean Lambert, Green MEP for London, described the government's view of EU law as \"completely wrong\". </p> <p>She said: \"In response to my question on the inclusion of living wage conditions in procurement processes, the [European] commission clearly states that living wage conditions can be included in public sector contracts, provided they are not discriminatory. Now that the government is aware that there is no problem under EU law, they can make progress on ensuring payment of the living wage for low-paid workers on the government estate, helping to ensure that work pays.\"</p> <p>Johnson said \"some of the most red-blooded capitalist firms you can imagine\" were signing up to the living wage because they realised it helped to create productivity and ensured staff enjoyed a decent standard of living.</p> <p>Cameron hailed the living wage as a \"good and attractive idea\" before the general election in 2010 and vowed that as the biggest employer in the country the government would take the lead to ensure that \"fairness will begin to be hardwired into pay scales up and down the country\". But two years on, the LLW has yet to be systematically deployed across Whitehall.</p> <p>Cameron's spokesman said: \"We are not proposing to require it of businesses. Requiring people to pay it would reduce the flexibility businesses have and could ultimately be a bad thing for jobs.\"</p> <p>Johnson urged the government to support low-paid workers in the capital.</p> <p>\"I would like to see Whitehall generally in London, I would like to see Labour councils, Tory councils, Liberal councils, supporting low-paid workers and pay the London living wage. A huge number of public sector workers could benefit from this.\"</p> <p>Johnson unveiled a trademark that formally recognises and accredits employers who pay the London living wage, courtesy of the Living Wage Foundation, which hopes the mark will become as recognisable as the Fairtrade logo.</p> <p>But it emerged that the Greater London Authority, led by Johnson, has yet to be added to the 76-strong list of accredited employers and that the five London borough councils included are all Labour-controlled. The GLA is on a separate list of 44 employers in the process of being accredited, which includes four more Labour-controlled London boroughs and Tower Hamlets, led by independent mayor Lutfur Rahman, with no Conservative-led council on either list.</p> <p>Johnson, who has for the past four years championed the LLW, established in 2005 by his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, outlined the mutual benefits of paying a rate \u00a32.36 above the minimum wage.</p> <p>He said \"some of the most redblooded capitalist firms you can imagine\" were signing up to the LLW because they realised it helped to create productivity as well as ensuring staff can enjoy a decent standard of living.</p> <p>Lovebridge Achempoang, a cleaner working for Lloyds of London, said receiving the LLW from his employer had made a big difference for him and his family. It had allowed him to spend more time with his three daughters, having previously worked very long hours to make ends meet, and coming home very late, feeling very tired.</p> <p>\"Because of the living wage I don't need to work so many hours and can now spend time with my family,\" he said. \"We might only be in a one-bedroom flat, but it's ours to live in and I'm very happy to be there. It feels good to be able to support myself and my family.\"</p> <p>Pressed on the fact that he is the only Conservative in the capital to show leadership by implementing the LLW rate to all GLA staff, Johnson said: \"I've certainly heard David Cameron support this and give very clear and categorical backing for what we are doing, so that's good.\"</p> <p>However, Johnson declined to be drawn on whether the government should lift the minimum wage to the living wage rates for inside and outside the capital. \"I certainly think it's important to pay people decently but we've got particular issues here in London which means the London living wage for the capital.\"</p> <p>Downing Street's claim that imposing the living wage as a condition of business would be in breach of EU procurement laws was challenged by Jean Lambert, Green MEP for London, as \"completely wrong\".</p> <p>\"In response to my question on the inclusion of living wage conditions in procurement processes, the [European] commission clearly states that living wage conditions can be included in public sector contracts, provided they are not discriminatory. Now that the government is aware that there is no problem under EU law, they can make progress on ensuring payment of the living wage for low-paid workers on the government estate, helping to ensure that work pays.\"</p> <p>Miliband vowed to address Britain's \"living standards crisis\" by delivering a living wage of at least \u00a37.20 an hour to millions of people in the public and private sector. He contrasted the 11 Labour councils that have already become living wage employers, with more on the way to acquiring living wage status, with the record of Conservative-led boroughs.</p> <p>Miliband outlined three policy proposals that could be used to promote the living wage: forcing employers to pay the living wage if they want to bid for public sector contracts; paying firms a subsidy if they pay the living wage, and forcing companies to say how many of their employees are receiving less than the living wage, as part of a natural extension of the principle of pay transparency at the top.</p> <p>\"There are almost 5 million people in Britain who aren't earning the living wage: people who got up early this morning, spent hours getting to work \u2013 who are putting in all the effort they can \u2013 but who often don't get paid enough to look after their families, to heat their homes, feed their kids, care for elderly relatives and plan for the future,\" he said. \"Too many people in Britain are doing the right thing and doing their bit, helping to build the prosperity on which our country depends, but aren't sharing fairly in the rewards.</p> <p>\"It's not how it should be in Britain. It's not how we will succeed as a country in the years ahead because we can't go on with an economy that works for a few at the top and not for most people. We need to change it.\"</p> <p>In London, an estimated 11,500 workers have benefited since the LLW was introduced in 2005. Johnson said the new rate of \u00a38.55 will be worth \u00a34.5m a year for lower-paid workers, and announced that InterContinental had become the first hotel chain to sign up to the living wage.</p> <p>Johnson blamed the fact that the GLA was still in the process of securing accreditation on \"historic\" authority contracts that would see the LLW implemented once they were renewed. Aides to Johnson said the GLA was implementing the LLW \"100%\" for its staff but not yet for all external contractors, and that the paperwork for such a large organisation, encompassing five functional bodies, meant the accreditation process was taking longer.</p> <p>Darren Johnson, a Green member of the London assembly, said: \"The mayor's support for the living wage is very patchy. I had to lobby him earlier in the year to get the official Olympics hotel partner signed up, and even then he broke his election promise to only promote living-wage hotels to tourists. It has been the same story with councils and Whitehall, where I have repeatedly lobbied him to raise it when meeting council leaders and ministers. That list of living-wage employers could have been a lot longer if the mayor had spent five years making the case at every opportunity, not just for the occasional press release.\"</p> <p>Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said the movement was growing as more employers realised the benefits of paying the rate. \"Like Fair Trade, it represents a new standard for responsible business. We hope to see the living wage mark and symbol spreading further and further across organisations in the UK.\"</p> <p>More than 80 employers have been formally accredited to the foundation, with 47 awaiting accreditation and a further 73 saying they are committed to paying the rate. Around 200 employers in London support the campaign, ranging from banks to universities.</p>",

He said that that inquiry had been a thorough one, but that its powers and terms of reference were limited. A further inquiry would probably uncover more abuse, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do not believe that the Waterhouse inquiry was a cover-up. I think it did a thorough job of investigating what it set out investigate, which was the abuse of children in care homes in north Wales.</p> <p>But there are two issues here. One was the terms of reference of the inquiry. It was set up to investigate the abuse of children in care homes. Although it looked at some of the paedophile activity in the immediate community around the Wrexham area, it didn't and it couldn't look at paedophile networks, perhaps even going beyond north Wales. That wasn't what it was primarily set up to do. </p> <p>Secondly, it's important to understand that the inquiry was not a police investigation. It could not arrest people, it could not charge people, it could not interview people under caution. It was reliant to a significant extent on the work that North Wales police had done previously. And by 1996, when the inquiry was set up, you had a complete breakdown of trust between many victims and North Wales police ... </p> <p>[The Waterhouse inquiry] a very thorough job with the evidence that it had. But what we are now talking about are a broader set of issues about broader networks. There are clearly allegations out there and we've seen over the last few weeks with the Savile issues how these kind of issues can come to light many years after the event. That's the nature of child abuse; it is often only many years after the event that things come to light. So I think there's every prospect of a further inquiry finding more information.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50991df095cb1506d24449a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T14:25:52.555Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ian Lucas</strong>, the Labour MP for Wrexham, was talking about the new inquiries into the north Wales abuse scandal on the World at One.

This was an inquiry that was conducted as a public inquiry, individuals came forward for help and gave very difficult evidence about events that had happened to them, and they felt at the end of the inquiry that no suitable action was taken ... </p> <p>There\u2019s a strong sense in Wrexham and in north Wales that evidence has been suppressed; it was suppressed at the time, and has been suppressed ever since. And I think what\u2019s very important [is] if we are to show that we intend to get to the bottom of these matters, what we have to do is to ensure that openness is brought into these matters for the first time, and that the evidence that was given to the Waterhouse inquiry is out there in the open, so that we know what evidence was given at that time, and we need to have explanations of why that evidence was not acted on.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50991b35b579f74bac764b83\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T14:14:14.029Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Matthew Taylor has been in touch on Twitter to say that he thinks Chris Byrant (see 1.09pm) is missing the point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MTPT/status/265812415441149952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewsparrow\">andrewsparrow</a> Bryant wasn't paying attention: NCA isn't investigating; NCA's DG (appointed October 2011) is. <a href=\"http://t.co/d0OT9oFp\" title=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/new-NCA\">homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/n\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Taylor (@MTPT) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MTPT/status/265812415441149952\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-06T13:46:33+00:00\">November 6, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509912f5b579f74bac764b79\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T14:07:04.573Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary of Theresa May's statement about the north Wales child abuse scandal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the main points from the May statement.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 May announced that Keith Bristow, the director general of the new National Crime Agency, will conduct an investigation into the north Wales child abuse allegations.</strong> He will lead a team of officers from the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and he will produce an initial report by April 2013. There will also be a separate inquiry into whether the Waterhouse inquiry did its job properly, but details of that have not been announced yet.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 She said the government would consider the case for a wider, all-encompassing inquiry into child abuse.</strong> Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said Labour wanted a single, over-arching inquiry. May said that she did not see the case for one now, but that there could be one later. \"If, at the end of the processes that we've set in train it appears that it is necessary to move forward to a wider investigation then we will look at that,\" she said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 May said Britain had \"an appalling and shameful\" record in relation to young people in care.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 May urged MPs not to use parliamentary privilege to name the senior Tory who is alleged to be involved in the north Wales abuse scandal.</strong> She said naming any suspects could jeopardise any future prosecution.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Tom Watson, the Labour party's deputy chair, accused May of being engaged in a \"cover-up\". </strong>He made the point in a question to May.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The lesson of Hillsborough and hacking is that a narrow-down investigation is the basic building block of a cover-up. To limit this inquiry to north Wales and Savile would in my view be a dereliction of the home secretary's duty. It would guarantee that many sickening crimes will remain uninvestigated and some of the most despicable paedophiles will remain protected by the establishment that has shielded them for 30 years. </p> </blockquote> <p>Watson said the new inquiry should follow any lead it finds. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whether you were raped or tortured as a child in Wales or in Whitehall you are entitled to be heard. The media may be transfixed by the spectre of a paedophile cabinet minster abusing children, but what actually matters is that thousands and thousand of children, whose lives have been ground into nothing, who prefer to kill themselves than carry on, who have nowhere to turn, to whom nobody listens, whom nobody helps.

returns or apply for the state pension online.</p> <p>He will say that the government handles more than one billion different transactions each year through 650 different services, but in only a few

Except that what Mr Clegg added, perhaps as a little \u201cby the way\u201d when he and Mr Cameron had a brief word last Tuesday, is that it won\u2019t end in the Lords: he and all his ministers and backbenchers will vote with Labour when the legislation returns to the Commons. In other words, Mr Clegg will lead his party against the Government \u2013 against his own Bill \u2013 precipitating its near-certain defeat ...</p> <p>The effect, I fear, could be far more serious. If Mr Clegg\u2019s plan goes through, any pretence of collegiality between Tories and Lib Dems will end. Party discipline will collapse. Mr Cameron will be powerless to sanction his own rebels when the Lib Dems are allowed to defeat the Government \u2013 and Labour will look for other ways to tempt them across the floor.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/rachelsylvester/article3591143.ece\">\u2022 Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says very few Tories want Mitt Romney to win the US presidential election.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s remarkable how many senior Tories are privately hoping that Barack Obama will win.

You cannot expect every country in the world to produce every tank, every ship, every plane that is necessary for that self defence.

So we will continue to do all we can to make the UK an attractive and accessible investment destination\". <br>Cameron will move on to Saudi Arabia later today where he is due to hold talks with King Abdullah and other senior figures on issues such as Iran, Syria and anti-terrorism work. <br>But the latest leg of his three-day tour is bound to be dogged again by controversy over his push for trade - including arms deals - with countries which have faced criticism for their human rights records.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0be85a55-2ab8-4832-8610-e0a925732fce\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352193692409/5a6799cd-1a97-408d-a18b-ff1328caa701-460.jpeg\" alt=\"David Cameron in Abu Dhabi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron is welcomed by government ministers to the Al Rawda palace in the city of Al Ain in Abu Dhabi.

Theresa May, the home secretary, will be giving more details about the new inquiries in a Commons statement at 12.30pm and, on the Today programme, she said the government was right not to ignore the new claims being made, particularly those raised on Newsnight on Friday.

Something for Romney to ponder, if he loses, as he stands dumbfounded in his car elevator, repeatedly pushing the up and down buttons, wondering where he went wrong.</p> <h2><strong>Most unexpected hate figure</strong></h2> <p> No contest: it was nerdy <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\" title=\"\">New York Times statistician Nate Silver</a>, whose implacable refusal to stop predicting an Obama win drove Republicans, and less numerate pundits, into a frenzy. How, they demanded, could his computer model keep showing such good news for the Democrats when old hands, like NBC's Joe Scarborough \u2013 simply by sniffing the air and studying their guts \u2013 knew that the race was \"tight as a tick\"? This was the <a href=\"http://unskewedpolls.com/\" title=\"\">election of \"unskewed\" polls</a> (translation: polls revised retroactively in order to favour your chosen candidate). And you can expect the \"war on math\" to get worse: as pollsters and campaigners get ever more sophisticated in their data-collection, commentators paid to speculate about the horse-race see their livelihoods at risk.</p> <h2><strong>Word least likely to be mentioned ever again by a Republican talking-head after the election, regardless of who wins</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/331977/benghazi-symbol-obama-s-leadership-mona-charen\" title=\"\">\"Benghazi\". </a></p> <h2><strong>Most alarmist prediction about what will happen if Obama is re-elected</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>These are all roughly the same: the dictatorship he'll usher in \u2013 aided, in many accounts, by a suddenly highly effective United Nations \u2013 <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/416176#.UJAGCVJJuSo\" title=\"\">will end democracy as we know it, making America a \"vassal state to a globalist entity\"</a> and confiscating everybody's guns.

According to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ud3pK5Wa90\" title=\"\">Chuck Norris (below) and his wife Gena, in a YouTube video </a>apparently recorded in his martial-arts studio, it means \"socialism or something much worse\", and \"a thousand years of darkness\". But the prize goes to <a href=\"http://2016themovie.com/\" title=\"\">Dinesh D'Souza, whose documentary Obama's America: 2016</a> explains that the president wants to send US wealth, and nukes, to the developing world, to win his deceased father's approval and placate Hawaiian nationalists. Or something. It doesn't make sense, but then of course it doesn't: Kenyan Islamo-communist logic is <em>designed </em>to be confusing. Nate Silver uses it, too!</p> <h2><strong>Worst public-speaking performance by a candidate or one of his surrogates </strong></h2> <p>A crowded field, given Rick Perry's splendid primary performance \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/rick-perrys-oops-in-republican-debate-could-have-long-lasting-implications-for-his-campaign-video/2011/11/09/gIQAqUBr6M_blog.html\" title=\"\">\"Oops!\" the Texas governor declared, when he realised he couldn't recall his own policies</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-chair-speech-romney\" title=\"\">Clint Eastwood's surreal double-act with an empty chair on stage at the Republican convention</a>. But no surprise that the honour goes to Obama's first-debate sleepwalking, an inexplicably rubbish display compounded by the instantaneous meltdowns suffered by several influential pundits. <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/dorsey/andrew-sullivans-obama-meltdown-in-8-key-gifs\" title=\"\">Andrew Sullivan, in the night's most memorable freak-out</a>, accused the president of \"self-immolating\", calling the debate a \"rolling calamity\" and a \"disaster\" \u2013 and thereby disregarding Karl Rove's First Rule of Partisan Punditry: your candidate won. Sure, in reality, your candidate lost. But that doesn't matter: your candidate won.</p> <h2><strong>Andy Warhol award for the person made briefly world-famous during the campaign with the least justification</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Republican primary candidate Herman Cain. But only because attention-seeking birther conspiracist and hair innovator Donald Trump was, for inexplicable reasons, already world-famous. The two should now establish a combined pizza parlour/real estate business in a very small town in a remote part of Wisconsin, and never seek the media spotlight again. Rudy Giuliani may wish to consider joining them.</p> <h2><strong>Biggest \"game-changer\"/ \"October Surprise\" </strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Not awarded: the truth is that, despite many false alarms, there wasn't one. (Remember Matt Drudge's supposedly shocking video of Obama's \"other race speech\"? Neither does anyone else.) Here's what happened instead: the two campaigns and their <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/campaign-finance\" title=\"\">super-PAC backers spent more than $1.8bn</a>; avoided the biggest issues; focused on trading insults; tailored their messages for the benefit of a few undecided voters in Ohio; and made sure their candidates were never subjected to tough interviews. This went on for months on end, until Ohio, the nation and the world were thoroughly disillusioned and annoyed. Great job, everyone!</p>",

  "<p>The other countries must feel so left out. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9653497/British-have-invaded-nine-out-of-ten-countries-so-look-out-Luxembourg.html\" title=\"\">New research</a> shows that practically everyone has been invaded by British troops at one point or another. A <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2227705/The-British-coming-Over-centuries-weve-invaded-staggering-90-worlds-nations.html\" title=\"\">\"staggering 90% of the world's nations\"</a> have been overrun by the turbulent Brits \u2013 Sweden, Mongolia and the Vatican City are among the 22 to have been tragically overlooked.</p> <p>If you think this is a facetious tone to adopt, it is nothing compared with the knockabout, what-a-larf tone of some of the coverage that has been lavished on this new book. In a way, this is what the book set out to accomplish. As its author says, it is lighthearted fun, and it claims not to take a moral stance on Britain's empire.</p> <p>In fact, that latter claim is not quite true. To begin with, the very posture of lighthearted satire implies a certain perspective on events that most people might find questionable. Imagine a gentle farce on the Rwandan genocide, and you see how incongruous it is. Moreover, when the author claims that there is much in Britain's imperial past to be proud of, and some aspects that would make one less proud, this is an explicit moral stance. It just happens to be a stance of, at best, moral ambivalence. Such just is the evasive register of empire nostalgia and apologia these days.</p> <p>In the previous decade, as New Labour's \"Britishness\" project proceeded in fits and starts, there was an earnest attempt by various figures, from <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-334208/Its-time-celebrate-Empire-says-Brown.html\" title=\"\">Gordon Brown</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview5\" title=\"\">Niall Ferguson</a>, to reclaim the empire from its opponents. This was essential. National pedagogy always proceeds along two temporal axes. On the one hand, the nation is always coming into being but not yet fully itself, hence the need for it to be educated about itself. On the other, it has always already existed, is eternal, and its people are linked with one another in a linear fashion through history, hence the need for the nation's past to be vindicated.</p> <p>For that reason, the invariant tone of the national revival and the empire peddling that came with it, was \"yes, there is much to regret, but overall we should be proud of Britain's past and awed by its imperial accomplishments\". This is unsurprisingly the underlying thrust of the coverage yielded by this book, and the tone of its publicity.</p> <p>Even so, the research certainly has some pedagogical value. For one thing, it shows the scope of empire's activities to extend well beyond the formal boundaries of the colonial sphere. It takes into account the activities of pirates and privateers acting on behalf of the crown just as much as invading armies. This does not just disclose the sheer scale of the enterprise of empire, shocking as it may be. It indicates that there may be much more to empires than the establishment of formal colonies, and that the time of empire may sprawl well beyond its previously delimited boundaries. Indeed, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Patterns_of_Empire.html?id=5kKOfAEUH9oC\" title=\"\">as the historian Julian Go has shown</a>, there are far greater similarities between the modalities of British imperial control and governance and those of the US than have previously been recognised.</p> <p>The shortcomings of this approach are nonetheless clear. First of all, it is ahistorical in that it treats as eternal what is contingent. Many of the listed invasions pre-date Britain's existence as a state. This is important because the beginnings of modern empire can be traced to the formation of British statehood out of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwellian_conquest_of_Ireland\" title=\"\">conquest of Ireland</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707\" title=\"\">union with Scotland</a>. The invasions of Gaul not only preceded this juncture but were actually conducted by the Roman occupiers of what was then an island of disunited tribal fiefdoms. The author may as well say that India invaded Burma in 1824 just because the British troops who conducted the invasion were mustered in India.</p> <p>Just as importantly, while the study of invasions gives us an insight into a cross-section of empire's scope, it is in one respect quite narrow and misleading. Invasions are an important punctuation in the development of an imperialist strategy, an initial means by which political or economic control is asserted, but they are not the point of the exercise. It is difficult, simply by looking at invasions, to understand how they are related in a wider ensemble of practices of imperialist power.</p> <p>For instance, Britain did not have to repeatedly re-stage the invasion of India in order to establish tiers of lasting control. And these can be just as deadly as invasions, if not more so: from the Great Famine to the Amritsar Massacre, to mention but a couple of nodal points in British colonial rule. Millions more perished between invasions than during them, as the result of the normal functioning of imperial control.</p> <p>But a story of that kind is not conducive to the easy conviviality of imperialist revival. It is less a story of adventure and intrigue, such as this latest book promises to be, than one of the banality of evil. It is routinised, institutional cruelty. And that just isn't a good larf.</p>",
  "<p>Nowhere is the increasingly fragmented nature of today's legal profession more evident than when considering the issue of pro bono \u2013 free legal services delivered by lawyers. From City lawyers working with NGOs on international aid projects in the third world, to running workshops on judicial independence in Albania through to beleaguered legal aid lawyers in Bolton helping the client who otherwise would not be able to secure \"access to justice\".</p> <p>It is National Pro Bono week \u2013 for a brief time lawyers put aside their usual reserve and bang the drum for all the good work they do for charity. And, to be fair, lawyers' commitment to volunteering is hugely impressive.</p> <p>A few snapshots from the incredibly broad spectrum of pro bono activity over the last 12 months include: the <a href=\"http://www.thefru.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Free Representation Unit</a>, a charity which helps people who cannot afford representation at employment and social security tribunals, fielded 532 volunteers to act for over 1,000 clients which they reckon is the equivalent of 24,500 hours of pro bono help; LawWorks, the pro bono clearing house, placed around half of 532 applications for legal help from community groups and a further 92 individual cases; and the City firm, Hogan Lovells claims to have dedicated some 104,047 total pro bono hours. For a more comprehensive overview of the state of pro bono, then check out the <a href=\"http://www.atjf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Pro Bono Yearbook of England and Wales</a>.</p> <p>The LawWorks pro bono survey \u2013 also out Tuesday \u2013 reflects the polarisation between City and high street in their relationship to the profession's voluntary activities. It draws on responses from 118 legal practices, mainly from the high street (39%) and international (22%) firms.</p> <p>Pro bono in City firms has become mainstreamed and so, for example, nearly all (95%) of respondents with more than 250 lawyers have a pro bono policy in place compared to less than one in three high street firms (32%). Most legal practices do not have a dedicated pro bono budget (71% of all respondents) however almost three-quarters (73%) of international firms do.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, given the economic climate, some of the larger firms are reporting a significant reduction in the number of hours they did globally in 2010 compared to 2011 \u2013 for example, <a href=\"http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/features/pro-bono-minding-gap\" title=\"\">Clifford Chance and Hogan Lovells (HL) are down 9% and 15% respectively</a>. Despite this, it is still a massive commitment - four out of 10 of HL's London lawyers are involved in pro bono activity.</p> <p>This split in attitude towards the voluntary endeavour of the legal profession is only likely to be further heightened by the challenging environment for law firms: increasing competition on the high street as a result of the Legal Services Act reforms, the brutal legal aid cuts coming in next year, and of course the longest double-dip recession since the second world war.</p> <p>The old pro bono line (\"pro bono is an adjunct to, not a substitute for legal aid ...\") has served as a useful reminder to warn ministers of their obligation to secure access to justice to those who otherwise couldn't afford it. But evidently such a consideration was a non-issue for the coalition government. The LASPO (<a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/legislation/bills-and-acts/acts/legal-aid-and-sentencing-act/laspo-background-information\" title=\"\">Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act</a>) cuts are predicated on one idea - to effectively filet our system of publicly-funded law by cutting \u00a3350m from a \u00a32.2bn scheme. But, perhaps, the \"adjunct to\" formula needs to be revisited post-LASPO.</p> <p>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/10/law-centres-need-solicitors-cash\" title=\"\">recently blogged</a> about the proposal of Paul im Thurn, senior solicitor at Cumbria Law Centre and co-chair of the Law Centre Federation, for adding \u00a325 to the solicitors' practicing certificate to fund law centres. The value of im Thurn's idea (it seemed to me) was two fold: firstly, to make sure those advice agencies stayed afloat to keep on helping those clients who so desperately need their help and, secondly, to highlight the government's shocking abdication of that responsibility. It seems that a coordinated and imaginative response by the pro bono movement to LASPO could highlight the failure of this government.</p> <p>Two years ago as part of the JusticeGap series, we published a collection of essays called <a href=\"http://thejusticegap.com/justicegapseries/wrongly-accused/\" title=\"\">Pro Bono: good enough?</a> with the rather unwieldy sub-heading \"The uneasy relationship between volunteer legal activity and access to justice\". One contributor Neil Kinsella, chief executive of Russell Jones &amp;Walker (now part of Slater &amp; Gordon) invoked legal aid's origins:</p> <p>As the Attlee government never set up a National Legal Service to match the NHS, society has \"always had to rely on the profession to help ensure access to justice\". If pro bono is \"fundamental to access to justice\", then it needs to be delivered in a more strategic and organised way, he argued.</p> <p>There were similar calls for some City firms in favour of a more strategic approach. \"Our default obligation is its 'access to justice for the poor' and above all else, our pro bono programs are about social welfare law support,\" Clifford Chance's then pro bono partner Michael Smyth said.</p> <p>If that debate about that \"uneasy relationship\" seemed timely then, how much more urgent does it seem now in the countdown to the April 2013 implementation of the LASPO cuts?</p> <p>It doesn't look likely to happen any time soon. Back to the LawWorks survey - the vast majority of firms (78%) have made no plans as part of their pro bono activity to respond to the legal aid cuts \u2013 apparently, high street firms were \"the least likely\" to be prepared to offer pro bono services to help those no longer eligible for legal aid. The report noted, \"widespread concern about the impact of LASPO but almost no planning or appetite for moving into new areas of pro bono work to fill the gaps\".</p> <p>J<em>on Robins is editor of </em><a href=\"http://thejusticegap.com/\" title=\"\"><em>thejusticegap.com</em></a><em> and is honorary editor of the Pro Bono Yearbook of England and Wales 2012</em></p>",
  "<p>Franchising has worked for businesses ranging from coffee shops to fast food restaurants, but does it work for social enterprises? There are currently less than 100 social franchises in the UK, but advocates of the concept say the potential for social enterprises to replicate their work around the country is massive. But how does a social enterprise go about setting up a franchise and what benefits does it offer?</p> <p>A report published in September this year by the <a href=\"http://www.the-icsf.org/\" title=\"\">International Centre for Social Franchising</a> (ICSF), entitled <a href=\"http://www.the-icsf.org/wp-content/2012/09/ICSF-Social-Franchising-Complete-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">Investing in Social Franchising</a>, identified 95 social franchises operating in the UK. The report defines social franchising as a \"successful social purpose organisation that enables at least one independent franchisee to deliver their proven model under license\". The report added that there are 897 commercial franchises currently in the UK, and that some of these could be adapted in order to provide social benefit \u2013 it cited the example of a grounds maintenance franchise that could be adapted to create employment opportunities specifically for disadvantaged people.</p> <p>ICSF chief executive Dan Berelowitz says there is \"huge potential\" for expanding social franchising in the UK and says there could be a \"significant increase in franchisors\" over the next three to five years. He adds that social franchising relies on social enterprises systematising the work they do. \"You put as much of the operational elements as possible into an operating manual, a day-to-day bible of the organisation,\" Berelowitz says. He acknowledges that turning the everyday workings of a social enterprise into a systematic operation that can easily be replicated elsewhere could be tricky. To this end, the ICSF is developing an 'online toolkit' \u2013 a prototype of which could be ready in mid-November \u2013 for small enterprises that want to replicate their work.</p> <p>The ICSF has highlighted the <a href=\"http://www.trusselltrust.org/foodbank-projects\" title=\"\">Foodbank network,</a> which is run by the Trussell Trust charity, as one of the UK's most successful social franchises with more than 250 franchisees.</p> <p>The foodbanks, which were established in 2004, provide emergency food and support to people 'experiencing crisis'. Foodbank franchisees co-operate and share learning, but, according to the ICSF report, the central charity remains firmly in control. FoodBank asks for a donation of 1,500 from franchisees as a \"set-up fee\" and an ongoing annual donation of \u00a3360 as a 'franchise fee'. These charges cover only one-third of the actual costs involved, with the Trussell Trust funding the remainder. However, there are other franchising models such as that used by <a href=\"http://www.caringchristmastrees.com/\" title=\"\">Caring Christmas Trees</a>, which charges a 5,000 franchise fee in order to provide additional income for the charity <a href=\"http://www.bethanychristiantrust.com/\" title=\"\">Bethany Trust</a>, which coordinates the initiative.</p> <p>Berelowitz says franchises do not have to conform to a particular legal structure. \"There is no set form, the key is that the model is proven,\" he says. Structures adopted by existing UK social franchises include federations \u2013 where member franchisees contribute cooperatively to the development of the entire organisation \u2013 or the 'central charity' model used by Foodbank where franchisees are spun out from the original charity, which maintains tight control.</p> <p>Alternatively, there is the 'arms length' model used by Caring Christmas Trees in which there is little co-operation between the different franchisees because of the simplicity of the product.</p> <p>How can a social enterprise find out if its work can be replicated elsewhere?</p> <p>The ICSF has a replication 'readiness test' on its website, which consists of ten questions relating to issues such as whether its model has been evaluated, its legal structure, financial arrangements, branding, and its market potential. \"This will give you a good idea of whether it will work,\" says Berelowitz.</p> <p>He adds that it's vital that social enterprises systematise their business model before franchising. \"If you don't systematise, you put stress on the franchisor-franchisee relationship\", says Berelowitz. \"I've seen it happen where a social enterprise wins a couple of awards, but then underestimate the time and energy involved in replicating it successfully.\"</p> <p>Though Berelowitz acknowledges that there are not any sources of funding that are specifically earmarked for social franchising, he suggests applying to the <a href=\"http://mutuals.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/investment-contract-readiness-fund-now-open\" title=\"\">\u00a310m investment and contract readiness fund</a>.</p> <p>What are the benefits of social franchising?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise UK's</a> head of policy, Ceri Jones, says franchising is a \"quicker and lower cost way of scaling up at a time when there are restrictions on accessing capital\". She adds: \"If you were considering wholly-owned growth in 12 cities, for example, the cost would be vast.\" Jones argues that, through franchising, social enterprises can benefit from existing expertise in other locations. \"It's off the shelf, you're getting the benefit of learning already done.\" In addition, Social Enterprise UK's <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/advice-support/resources/social-franchising-manual\" title=\"\">Social Franchising Manual</a> says that franchising enables an organisation to expand \"without growing an organisation in a traditionally hierarchical way that creates distance from the frontline\".</p> <p>What does franchising a social enterprise involve?</p> <p>\"It's about finding a partner aligned with your values, working on understanding your business and finding a place where there is demand,\" Jones says. \"You have to consider the nature of the license you will grant, what training and support there will be, branding, and intellectual property issues.\" Jones adds that it is also important to consider how much control you will exercise over your franchisees, and argues that franchising may not be suitable for social enterprises that, say, work with vulnerable people because there could be dangers in relinquishing control to franchisees.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Oxfam</a> director of strategy and ICSF partner Kate Wearing says housing associations are particularly well placed to develop social franchises. \"We [the ICSF] are meeting with housing associations with regard to improving the impact of their supply chain \u2013 housing associations could provide funding for ground maintenance businesses to be run as a social enterprise, for example,\" she says. Wearing highlights the <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Housing Federation</a> report <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/publications/find_a_publication/general/green_light.aspx\" title=\"\">Green Light: Creating Jobs Through Social Enterprise</a>, which concluded that housing associations are ideally placed to fulfil the role of franchisors and franchisees given that they work for the \"benefit of the community and in many instances its poorest residents\".</p> <p>London-based children's health education charity <a href=\"http://www.lifeeducation.org.uk/newsletter/newsindex.php?action=publicarticle&amp;id=285\" title=\"\">Coram Life Education (CLE)</a> is one charity that has successfully replicated its work across the UK using the franchise model. It has 24 franchisees \u2013 which are predominately other charities \u2013 that teach 800,000 children per year about healthy eating and educate them about drugs and alcohol from a fleet of mobile classrooms. Potential franchisees approach the CLE board with a proposed business model, which will set out for example how much fundraising is needed if the local schools will not cover the full cost of the service in their area. If the franchise is approved by the board it will give the franchisee a template of CLE's memorandum and articles of association. CLE also quality assures the service provided by the franchisee and also assists them in fundraising.</p> <p>CLE operations director David Burton says: \"The business comes to us, people will say children in our community need our support \u2013 if for example, alcohol is a particular issue in their area, we will help them design a special programme. We also assist them in raising funds for a mobile classroom, it costs about \u00a3100,000 to develop a business in each location.\"</p> <p>He adds that CLE gives each franchise the power and tools to take ownership of their project.</p> <p>In addition, a locally run franchise is best placed to fundraise, Burton argues. \"There's a strong economic argument, they [franchisees] know where the money is locally so they can go to local businesses to raise funds.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>In his role as UN special envoy for global education, Gordon Brown has declared this coming Saturday 10 November 10th a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20045482\">'global day of action'</a> in support of Malala Yousafzai, a month to the day that the 15-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl was attacked by the Taliban, simply for insisting that she go to school. </p> <p>As she recovers in a Birmingham hospital, Brown has urged people to support the estimated 32 million girls worldwide who are denied the right to go to school every day, by marking <strong>Malala Day</strong>. The tribute will coincide with his trip to Pakistan <a href=\"http://educationenvoy.org/\">to deliver a petition</a> containing more than a million signatures, to President Asif Ali Zardari, urging him to make education a reality for all Pakistani children, irrespective of gender. </p> <p>The plans for Malala Day reminded me of the girls that I grew up with, who were also denied their right to learn; the irony is that it happened right here, in the backstreets of inner-city Bradford. Some of these girls I know well since they are my first cousins, British-born Pakistanis just like me. My cousin Aisha comes to mind immediately, since she was around the age that Malala is today when she was permanently removed from school during the early 1980s. She had just reached puberty, you see, which posed a threat to her father, just as Malala's adolescence was a menace to the Taliban.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398883592\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/4/5/1270499996771/British-PM-Gordon-Brown-006.jpg\" alt=\"British PM Gordon Brown\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordon Brown; taking Malala's battle back to Pakistan. Photograph: Luke MacGregor/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke MacGregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aisha's father and mine both hail from a village in the Chach region of Pakistan, which borders Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where the Swat Valley is located; the valley which is home to Malala and her family. People from the Chach make up the second largest community of Pakistanis in Britain with sizeable populations in Birmingham and Bradford; people with origins in the Mirpur region in Pakistani Kashmir make up around 70%. </p> <p>Although the Chach region is free from Taliban rule, it still follows the stringently patriarchal Pakhtunwali code of conduct which is essentially obsessed with controlling women's behaviour. You see, the Chach people hold their honour very dear; and honour for the Chach or Chachis is inextricably linked to a woman's virginity, so the slightest irregularity in a woman's behaviour threatens the reputation of the clan \u2013 men as well as women. And when a community's value system is based on honour, a blemish could have long lasting repercussions. Since female virginity is deemed to be such a liability, it follows that women's behaviour and movements must be strictly controlled.</p> <p>This is why educating girls is deemed to be destructive for this community. Not only would schooling broaden a girl's mind, it might also provoke her to rebel against the system, thereby also dishonouring the clan. I have heard uncles say:</p> <blockquote> <p>Why would I want to teach my daughter how to write? So she can write love letters? </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Aisha's father was unable to appreciate the value of schooling his daughter so he chose to terminate her compulsory education. He was also deeply uncomfortable about his 14 year old daughter coming into contact with the opposite sex in the classroom. </p> <p>The common method for fooling the education authorities during the 1980s was to buy a plane ticket \u2013 one way of course - purely for the purpose of presenting it as evidence that the schoolgirl was being sent to Pakistan for good. The ticket was then returned to the travel agent for a nominal fee. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Aisha stayed in inner city Bradford, swapping school for an intensive course of domesticity, to prepare her for imminent marriage. Since the family lived in a rear house, in a back-to-back Victorian terrace, Aisha could easily venture out into the yard without being seen from the street. And if she needed to go any further, then she was draped in a black bhurka from head to foot, with matching face veil \u2013 which she still wears today. </p> <p>After a year or so, Aisha's father feared the authorities were on to him so he swiftly sent her to Pakistan. I met my cousin a few years later, when she returned with her Pakistani husband, a child in her arms and another on the way. With her husband's level of education even poorer than hers, and with Aisha relying on him to run her errands, it made tricky work of the simplest tasks. The first time she sent him out to buy a tin of tomatoes, he returned with baked beans. Not only did family life make it impossible for Aisha to take up her studies where they'd been interrupted, she perpetuated the cycle by marrying off her own daughter at a young age too \u2013 although Aisha did allow her the concession of completing her compulsory years in school. </p> <p>Today, Aisha is barely 40 years old and she is already a grandmother. I am acutely aware that my life might have been very different had my father played a greater role in my upbringing. Moreover, I could never understand how someone as independent and educated as my mother could marry into my father's conservative family in the first place. The mystery was finally unravelled in the course of my current research about <a href=\"http://www.brad.ac.uk/theatre/whats-on/BHM/Cartographies-of-love/\">Muslim women's experiences of love and marriage</a>. I decided to include my mum among the three generations of Pakistani women I interviewed in Bradford and Kirklees.</p> <p>Mum explained that her parents had originally planned for her to marry one of her cousins from their ancestral village in the Punjab. The system secured family ties and offered some guarantees about the suitor's character and standing, since he was already known to the bride's parents. But the plan changed after mum was deemed to be too overqualified to marry from among the pool of cousins that had been lined up. Like Malala's father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, my grandfather was also committed to educating his daughters. So much so that villagers mocked him for selling land to pay for school fees. They taunted: </p> <blockquote> <p>You're flogging the most valuable commodity you have, and you're squandering it on your daughters! What's the point of educating them? And besides, where will you find men to marry your girls?</p> </blockquote> <p><br>My grandfather eventually left the village for Rawalpindi so he could offer his daughters the same educational opportunities as his son. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398883593\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350657522707/Malala-Yousafzai-002.jpg\" alt=\"Malala Yousafzai\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malala Yousafzai. Fighting back. Photograph: Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, my father was a family associate settled in Britain. He wrote to my grandfather asking for his daughter's hand. With the concept of courtship completely non-existent, mum's acceptance was based on a handful of letters that were exchanged between her father and the suitor. Although my grandfather had reservations about the suitor's notoriously conservative family background, he reasoned that someone who'd been living in England for almost ten years must be well educated and westernised. You see, the suitor had left Pakistan whilst he was mid school, in his early teens during the 1950s. </p> <p>Mum told me:</p> <blockquote> <p>I could see that my father preferred the idea of me leading a married life in England where I could fit in better, rather than in our village. Because that was pretty much the alternative.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Little did she know that as soon as her husband arrived in England, he headed straight for the textile mills of Bradford where a willingness to graft was all that was needed. Work was plentiful, well-paid, and didn't require much English, nor any skills or qualifications. </p> <p>In fact, it was mum's qualifications which proved to be our saving grace when she found herself left in Bradford with three children to raise by herself, several years later.

  "<p>At long last, the candidates will fall silent, the pollsters will put away their clipboards and the hush of election day will descend on America. In their tens of millions, watched anxiously by billions more around the world, Americans will finally end a long and bitter campaign, cast their votes and choose a president.</p> <p>In a frenzied closing day, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney crammed in final visits to key battleground states \u2013 the president ending what, win or lose, will be his last campaign in the place where his \"improbable journey\" began nearly five years ago, in rural, midwestern Iowa. There is little more they can do.</p> <p>Their fates lie now with the machines they have built on the ground, the efficiency of their get-out-the-vote operations and, of course, with the voters themselves.</p> <p>The president acknowledged as much when he addressed a rally in the frigid night air of Bristow, Virginia, late on Saturday. \"I'm sort of a prop in the campaign,\" Obama said, conceding that at this late stage organisation is king.</p> <p>As to who is the more confident of victory, there the battle is less between Obama and Romney than between two political tribes: the priests and the mathematicians.</p> <p>Those of a scientific bent, who crunch the numbers and regard the uber-analyst and blogger Nate Silver as a secular deity, believe the contest is all but in the bag for the Democrat.</p> <p>Yes, the national polls may be locked in a statistical tie, but in the decisive states \u2013 chief among them Ohio, where Romney will make one more, tradition-defying visit on Tuesday \u2013 Obama has held a narrow but consistent lead, one that firmed up during the final weekend.</p> <p>Experience suggests election eve polls tend to be borne out on the day itself. The mathematicians say Romney's path to 270 electoral college votes has become so convoluted as to be near-impossible.</p> <p>To win, they argue, he would need to be comfortably ahead in the likes of Virginia and Colorado and he is not. They cite 2004, when incumbent George W Bush was similarly deadlocked in national polls only to beat John Kerry.</p> <p>They confidently expect Obama to repeat the trick, while one bookmaker, Paddy Power, has already paid out \u00a3400,000 to punters who backed the president. Silver gives Obama an 86.3% chance of victory.</p> <p>The priests however \u2013 a fraternity that currently includes many Republicans \u2013 insist such certainty is impossible. An election is a human event, with too many variables. They note the polling that says independent voters are breaking for Romney in Ohio, which would usually point to success. They argue that the electorate is not the same as it was in 2008, that there will be fewer young and African-American voters and that that will hurt Obama. They point to specific counties where early voting indicates Democratic turnout down and Republican turnout substantially up.</p> <p>That's hardly a surprise, say many Democrats, considering what they call \"voter suppression\" efforts by Republican state officials, closing polling stations and cutting short early voting in heavily Democratic areas. Tellingly, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/us/politics/campaigns-brace-to-sue-for-votes-in-crucial-states.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">the Obama campaign has 2,500 lawyers</a> on standby in Ohio alone, just in case things get close and ugly.</p> <p>Most unexpectedly, Republicans have seized on Pennsylvania, which their party has not won since 1988 but where a poll showed Obama's earlier lead wiped out, the two men on 47% each. If Pennsylvania is genuinely wobbling, that would spell disaster for the president.</p> <p>Publicly, the Obama camp dismissed the poll as rogue and politically tainted. But they took it seriously enough to deploy their biggest gun, sending a hoarse Bill Clinton to do four events in the state on Monday.</p> <p>Above all, the priesthood points to those intangibles they say the data-analysts miss. Romney is addressing large, enthused rallies which, they believe, do not suggest a candidate heading to defeat. On Friday, the Republican brought out between 20,000 and 30,000 to West Chester, Ohio. This same weekend, an Obama event saw only around 2,000 Ohioans fill a high school gym in Cleveland.</p> <p>Still, Democrats can cite intangibles of their own. On Saturday night, some 25,000 braved icy temperatures to attend that late night rally in Virginia.</p> <p>They whooped their delight at seeing two presidents, Clinton and Obama, high-five and hug, memories of the 2008 battle between them safely buried. The eyes of supporters may not have shone with hope and expectation the way they did when Obama addressed an election eve crowd of more than 80,000 in the state four years ago. \"But now there's real strong determination to let him finish his work,\" volunteer Richard Russey, 60, told me. Next to him, Sharon Jenkins, 54, said she was part of a \"veritable army\" of Obama activists that was bigger than in 2008.</p> <p>What's intriguing is the absence on both sides of what New York Times columnist Ross Douthat calls the \"aura of defeat\", defined as a losing campaign's tendency to go negative, hyping up trivial issues to motivate core supporters and seizing on minor slip-ups by the other side. A fortnight ago, Douthat detected that aura around Obama.</p> <p>But in the final days, there was little sign of it. In Bristow, Obama's closing argument focused firmly on the big picture, even extending to some Martin Luther King style rhetoric. \"It's up to you,\" he told them. \"You've got the power. That's why I need you, Virginia. Don't get tired, don't get weary.\"</p> <p>Romney too exudes confidence. On Monday he addressed an energetic, flag-waving indoor crowd in Fairfax, Virginia who cheered every time he spoke of \"when I'm president,\" urging them to make the \"one final push\" that would bring \"a new tomorrow.\"</p> <p>But there is the odd lurch into that losing mode of behaviour. On Monday Romney was still attacking Obama for suggesting voters should get their \"revenge\" at the ballot box, a remark Fox News and the Republicans interpreted as a coded call for class war. In fact it was nothing of the sort, but that didn't stop Romney piously insisting that voters be motivated not by revenge, but \"love of country\".</p> <p>More important, there have been the first signs of Republicans turning on each other, getting their retaliation in early. Chief among these \"precriminations\" is the view that Romney failed to reach beyond white America, that their party is too concentrated in the deep south and the great plains.</p> <p>The mathematicians would say Republicans are right to have that argument now.

But we also know that only a minority can be adopted.\"</p> <p>Mansuri, who will address the Lords select committee on adoption legislation led by Lady Butler-Sloss, said ministers increased their popularity by highlighting difficulties in adoption but did not take responsibility: \"They set the policies and release the resources. What Gove said is an example of adoption as a political football, of the misrepresentation and distortion that gets people's backs up.\"</p> <p>The changes relating to race and adoption had the backing of significant stakeholders, many of whom sat on a working group led by Gove's adoption tsar Martin Narey. But there is continuing disquiet among some minority social workers and activists who say local authorities will feel less obliged to find the most advantageous match. This summer, around 60 people met to protest that ministers were downgrading the importance of race and heritage in the adoption process. The Race Equality Foundation subsequently sent a critique of ministers' adoption intervention to Butler-Sloss's select committee.</p> <p>Sally Baffour, a black adoptive mother and a former government adviser who was for six years a trustee of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, said: \"There are going to be cavalier decisions made. If it is possible to make a quick match and take the pressure off, why keep looking for a better one?\"</p> <p>Baffour, who sits on adoption panels, said trans-racial adoptions are hard to get right. \"Race and heritage and culture are important, but ministers seem totally dismissive. A lot of people think the repercussions are going to be very damaging.\"</p> <p>Marlene Ellis, a black Londoner raised for 18 years by white foster parents in the home counties, said the complexities should not be underestimated. \"It is impossible to come out really clear and comfortable about who you are in a society that still has very clear classifications for race and culture,\" she said. \"My parents did the best they could do but there are subtle things that happen that erode your confidence. My real memory is loneliness; of not knowing.\"But minsters can say, with justification, that some social work professionals and trans-racial adoptees fully back the government's stance on race and adoption. Jo Bonnett, a black police officer raised in rural Leicestershire and east London by white English adoptive parents, is one of them. \"I didn't find it a negative experience,\" she says \"I think I was very lucky. I had an older brother who was their birth son; a brilliant childhood and fantastic friends. My challenges came at 17, but when you get to that age, and have been brought up in a loving household, you are strong enough to deal with racism or any issues you might have.\"She said the benefits greatly outweigh the drawbacks. \"I don't think race matters in adoption as long as you have loving parents and have all the things a child needs.\"</p> <p>Bonnett, 40, said she and her husband, who is white, tried themselves to adopt a black child. \"But we were told the child must be mixed race. Ridiculous!\"</p> <p>The figure most directly identified with the adoption review was Tim Loughton, the coalition's first children's minister, but he lost his job in the reshuffle. He was replaced by Edward Timpson. Loughton will also appear before the Lords select committee as will officials from the the College of Social Work. Having conducted a survey, the College of Social Work will say ministers are right to speed the adoption process but must be careful to ensure that haste doesn't lead to bad decisions and adoption breakdowns.</p> <p>Nearly 90% of social workers polled say adoptions take too long. And more than half think it is right to tackle delays caused by caused by 'excessive emphasis' on an ethnic match between the child and its adoptive parents. But the college will tell peers that most do not feel adequately trained to deal with adoption. Alongside the parliamentary discussions, there will be initiatives incoming days to raise the profile of adoption as part of National Adoption Week.</p> <p>A Department for Education spokeswoman said the government's motivation was to \"make it as easy as possible for people to foster and adopt so that more children in care find loving and stable homes.\" She added: \"We have also introduced measures to tackle delay, sharpen accountability, and hold the local authorities slowest to act to account.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012. The original said Edward Timpson was adopted. That is not the case.</p>",

Still, Romney got big cheers from a crowd that had waited hours in the freezing New Hampshire cold to see his final nighttime rally before the polls open.</p> <p>\"This is where my campaign began.

In the Iowan capital Des Moines, Obama spoke to a packed downtown rally of 20,000 people braving freezing temperatures.</p> <p>It was a moment of poignant memories for the First Couple. \u201cI have come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where our movement began.\u201d</p> <p>Obama recounted tales of his early campaign, talking of a bare bones operation in 2008 that turned American politics on its head. \u201cYou welcomed me and Michelle into your homes,\u201d he said. He also told a lengthy anecdote about how his old campaign slogan of \u201cfired up, ready to go\u201d came about at a South Carolina event.</p> <p>Michelle Obama also took the stage and reminisced about past campaign events in Iowa, including \u2013 apparently \u2013 once seeing her spouse\u2019s face carved out of butter. The First Lady spoke softly, despite a microphone, and was clearly feeling the magnitude of the moment. \u201cThis is an emotional time for us. This is the final event of my husband\u2019s final campaign,\u201d she said. She appealed to voters to remember the promise of four years ago, here in the state where it all began. \u201cHe stayed true to himself,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Rock star Bruce Springsteen had sought to warm up the chilly crowd and played songs with none-too-subtle titles like No Surrender and The Promised Land and Land of Hope and Dreams. But the mood overall \u2013 perhaps because of the low temperatures and late hour or just because it came at the end of a gruelling campaign \u2013 felt a little subdued, though undoubtedly cheerful. For a true moment of history it was somewhat reflexive with little wild or loud cheering from the large crowd.</p> <p>Obama himself sounded some of the old riffs from his 2008 campaign, appealing to Americans as a whole. \u201cWe fall and rise together as one people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Then he touted his first term credentials, incuding the ending of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Osama bin Laden and rising home values. Then he appealed to Iowa voters to stick with him at tomorrow\u2019s ballot boxes. \u201cWe are not done yet on this journey. We have got more road to travel,\u201d he said. But it was not all positive, saying Mitt Romney wanted to take America backwards. \u201cafter all that we have fought through together we cannot give up on change now,\u201d Obama said.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-12e16bd8-16b9-4a91-a2bc-a96078f4723f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352177559597/4dd97e9a-e937-4655-bb8a-5729897b0e65-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama final rally in Iowa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama speaks during his last rally in Des Moines, Iowa.

Even if he wins, Obama will not run for office again. This is it.</p> <p>The choice of Iowa seems political, sentimental and practical. Political because Iowa\u2019s six electoral college votes could really matter in a tight election. Iowa is a swing state and up for grabs and some serious presidential attention could be vital. Sentimental because this is the state were it all began way back in January 2008, when Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the caucus here, proving a black outsider could win over white voters with a powerful message of change. Practical because its near Chicago. Once this event is over then it is a short hop home to wait for the results.</p> <p>Certainly the crowds are showing up as thousands of people queued through the streets of downtown Des Moines, braving chilly air and a several-hour-long wait. Though their patience is almost certainly helped by the added attraction of a free Bruce Springsteen concert. You do not get to see The Boss that often in these parts. The event is happening in a knot of streets called the East Village (no relative to the New York neighbourhood). Already a drum band is playing as a large crowd packs into the area, stretching back to Des Moine's Capitol building.</p> <p>Shannon Minschall, a 41-year-old nursing home worker, scored seats in the front row thanks to his sister being the sign language interpreter for the evening. He was exceedingly positive about Obama\u2019s chances of winning the state. \u201cI think he will take it by at least four points,\u201d he said. \u201cConsidering the people he\u2019s had road blocking him in Congress for four years, I think he has done a good job.\u201d But Minschall did admit there was an enthusiasm gap among Democrats. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same enthusiasm as last time but people will show up. They know it is too important,\u201d he added. But in the meantime there is history in the making: Obama\u2019s last rally.</p> <p>Which, makes this correspondent a little nostalgic. I was in the convention hall when Obama gave his 2004 speech in Boston. I went to a 2006 fundraiser at Conde Naste in Manhattan when he was mulling a run (and the mistaken conventional wisdom was he would not). Then came 2008 versus Hillary and after that, the battle versus John McCain and Sarah Palin and the Great Recession. Now it's 2012 and his last ever campaign rally. Even though Obama might have a second term ahead of him, it all shows how remarkably quickly American politics can work. It also makes me feel distressingly old.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b53b6ebd-369a-4c02-b654-964919267f48\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352169049654/c07bab59-2c52-461b-9696-b44936526b40-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama in Ohio\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama speaks to supporters in Columbus, Ohio, tonight.

A family man. But it is about job performance,\u201d Zaun said. That sounded fair enough for a Republican on election eve. But then Zaun spoiled it with the old canard that Obama has taken America on some sort of dangerous foreign tangent. \u201cIs there anyone here who would like to become a European nation?\u201d Zaun asked. \u201cNo!\u201d the crowd roared back. But, look, just this week it was announced the <a href=\"http://www.li.com/media/press-releases/2012-legatum-prosperity-index-american-dream-at-risk-in-key-election-year\">US has crashed out of the top ten of the world\u2019s most prosperous nations</a>.

Ryan, whose voice hinted at being hoarse after a punishing schedule in recent weeks, hit his usual notes of painting tomorrow\u2019s vote as generational in importance.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not just picking a president for four years. We are picking a path for our nation,\u201d he said. He talked about the economy and the need for change, painting the familiar picture of a broken country, high joblessness and mounting debts, both personal and national. \u201cWe can fix this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Then he used a more recent attack line picking up on comments Obama made for supporters to vote out of \u201crevenge\u201d. The comment has been made into a radio ad already playing on Iowa airwaves. \u201cThat is not hope and change. That is not aspirational. That is not what we do in this country.

And they laughed when he said: \u201cYou know I fight for change, I've got the scars and the grey hair to prove it.\u201d</p> <p>Before he crawled to his closing statement, Obama said: \u201cI've got a whole lot of fight left in me Ohio, and I hope you have too.\u201d I've heard him say that line several times, and it's always been delivered as a clarion call to arms.

Whatever flaws scar Obama's first administration (drones, cough, drones; watered-down Wall Street reform, cough), I find them proactively superior to Romney's. And no matter who wins, an invasion of zombie hordes is a long-shot outcome. (As Joss Whedon&#xa0;<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/10/29/joss-whedon-warns-that-mitt-romney-could-spur-zombie-apocalypse/\">advises</a>, you might collect canned goods and practice&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour\">parkour</a>, anyway; Romney's ahead of us on that score.)</p> <p>Over time, we in the US tend to do OK. We've made serious mistakes as a country, sometimes dodging apocalypse or genocide by a combination of luck and sheer bloodymindedness. We've let our government take action in gruesome ways \u2013 internment camps, Vietnam, Iraq. And, as citizens, we've stood by while injustices rolled over other people's lives (this individualized list is too painful and too long to articulate).</p> <p>But we tend to learn from our mistakes; we tend to correct them, as best we can. Our always re-enforced self-interest and offhand sense of fairness produces a kind of lazy arc toward justice. Frustration and outrage bring wars to an end (\"We're still in Iraq? Why?\"). Protest and disenchantment with pursuing a failing cause allow rights to expand (\"I'm not going to get up off the couch to keep gays from marrying\").</p> </blockquote> <p>Well worth a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/05/mitt-romney-presidency-not-freaking-out\">full read here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50982b4495cb1506d2444949\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T21:10:28.436Z\">9.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill weighs in on the Romney camp's <strong>unusual decision</strong> to continue campaigning on election day:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The candidates normally do not campaign on election day. It is a time for volunteers ferrying and cajoling voters to the polling stations. So Romney is breaking the convention by continuing to campaign Tuesday in Pennsylvania and Ohio. His campaign staff has just announced that Paul Ryan too is to keep on going in Janesville, Wisconsin, his home state. No big hardship for him. Just in case he fails to make it as vice-president, he kept his name on the ballot for re-election to the House and a little campaign time in the state can't help.</p> </blockquote> <p>The move by Romney is not unprecedented. The <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/265953-romney-to-campaign-on-election-day-in-battlegrounds-ohio-pa\">Hill notes</a> that Obama visited Indiana in 2008 on Election Day, and President George W. Bush visited Ohio in 2004. Romney however appears to be laying plans for unprecedented Election Day activity, including the first two-state swing. </p> <p>We're not willing to declare it a problem until the Romney camp announces plans to continue campaigning on Wednesday.

  "<p>David Cameron has defended British arms sales to Gulf countries as \"entirely legitimate\" but insisted that the Arab spring was a positive development and there were no \"no-go areas\" in talks with autocratic allies who are fretting about changes elsewhere in the region.</p> <p>Speaking on the first day of a three-day middle east tour, the prime minister rebuffed critics unhappy with the idea of UK defence exports and said his discussions in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both irritated by rows with Britain, would show \"respect and friendship\".</p> <p>The trip is aimed at drumming up business in both countries for BAE Systems, the defence manufacturer. An important BP oil deal in Abu Dhabi has run into trouble recently.</p> <p>Thirty thousand jobs in the UK were at stake, sales were \"legitimate and right\" and his purpose was \"to help Britain compete and thrive in the global race\" he said. Cameron wants to persuade the UAE to buy Eurofighter Typhoons to replace their ageing fleet of French Mirage jets. The Emiratis have expressed interest in ordering 60 jets. Oman has expressed interest in 12, while the Saudis are considering a second order on top of the 72 they already have.</p> <p>Amnesty International criticised what it described as a \"deeply-disturbing trade-off\" between trade and strategic interests and the promotion of rights and democratic reform. The Campaign Against the Arms Trade condemned what it called \"a very clear UK message of support for these authoritarian regimes\". Promoting arms sales meant concerns about human rights were \"empty words,\" it added.</p> <p>Speaking to students in the UAE's capital, Abu Dhabi, Cameron said: \"I'm a supporter of the Arab spring, the opportunity of moving towards more open societies, more open democracies, I think is good for the Middle East, for North Africa.\"</p> <p>But the UAE's minster of foreign affairs issued a thinly-veiled rebuke as he accompanied Cameron to an airfield to see a display of RAF Typhoons. \"Many people are still caught in the euphoria of the Arab spring,\" said Anwar Gargash. \"But in reality what we're seeing currently is basically an entrenchment of conservative religious parties. They're taking control.\"</p> <p>The two countries have clashed privately in recent months over criticism in the UK media of the treatment of Islamists in the UAE. It and other conservative Gulf countries are unhappy with the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood during the last two years of change across the region.</p> <p>The Saudis object to a parliamentary inquiry into UK relations with them and Bahrain. British government officials are aware of the need to balance military and economic interests in what Downing Street called \"two of Britain's most important strategic allies in the Gulf\" with political and human rights concerns.</p> <p>Both parties fear Iran's nuclear programme and regional ambitions. Cameron said he believed Tehran was trying to develop nuclear weapons which he said would make the Middle East \"a more unstable and more dangerous place\".</p> <p>Amnesty International UK's head of policy and government affairs Allan Hogarth said: \"Selling arms to countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE should only be considered if there are absolutely watertight guarantees over them not being used to commit human rights violations.</p> <p>\"Saudi Arabia has been the recipient of record-breaking arms deals involving the UK, yet these have been highly secretive and there's been little or no follow-up over how the weaponry was used.\"</p> <p>In 2009 the Saudi air force used UK-supplied Tornado fighter-bombers in attacks in Yemen which killed hundreds \u2013 possibly thousands \u2013 of civilians. \"In the past a large Saudi chequebook has apparently meant it could purchase weapons as well as silence over its own dreadful human rights record. It's time for David Cameron to end this deeply disturbing trade-off.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"We do have a large and important defence industry in this country. The prime minister is keen to see that industry prosper. That is an important thing for jobs in this country. We have very strict rules, which are regularly reviewed, on the export of defence equipment.\"</p>",

His Houston Dynamo side were outsiders last year, but dispatched Philadelphia with minimum fuss, before that famous win in Kansas City that took them to the MLS Cup final. That time, the Galaxy were an opponent too far, but this year, once again, Kinnear looks to have nursed his side through periodically indifferent form, a long road stretch to start the season etc. and ended up bringing them to the playoffs looking like they\u2019re peaking nicely once again.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5096cea195cb1506d2444875\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-04T20:22:57.819Z\">8.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sporting Kansas City</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sporting come into the playoffs having <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/09/us-open-cup-2012-final-sporting-kansas-city-seattle-sounders\">already won a cup this year</a>. And while that\u2019s been a huge psychological boost for the team that Peter Vermes has built, when I spoke to the coach last month he was insistent that the game that had most impact on his side was losing the Eastern Conference final to today\u2019s opponents last year. In that game, Sporting\u2019s front three of Teal Bunbury, Kei Kamara and rookie of the year CJ Sapong were isolated from their midfield and failed to spark, let alone dominate. Even with Brad Davis limping out of the game, Houston scored twice to eliminate a team who thought they may be about to bring back a title to their brand new stadium.</p> <p>Since then Kamara and Sapong have developed a mentor/mentee relationship that has seen the former thrive on the responsibility, and the latter successfully navigate his inevitable dips in form after his breakout debut season. Sporting\u2019s 4-3-3 has got more solid since last year and the front three seem much more mindful of their defensive duties. And at the back Colin and, of course, the omnipresent Jimmy Nielsen have been the foundational bedrock for the team. Sporting don\u2019t always score as many as they should, but they rarely put themselves in a position where they have to. They were not top of the East by accident.</p> <p>That said, their contests with Houston tend to be tight affairs. With their own emphasis on winning the battle in midfield, the Dynamo match up well with Sporting. Here\u2019s what happened when the two sides last met at Livestrong Sporting Park in September.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYba9B9aL-A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qYba9B9aL-A?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T00:14:57.031Z\">at 12.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5096ccde95cb1506d2444872\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-04T20:15:26.538Z\">8.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Houston Dynamo</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Houston arrived in the semis with an efficient performance against Chicago Fire in the one-off wild-card game on Wednesday night. While that was a road game, the general momentum of Chicago\u2019s season since their early Fall highs, made for a curiously unconfident performance from the hosts, starting with Sean Johnson at the back, and Houston rode a confident goalkeeping performance by Tally Hall and two goals by Will Bruin to win fairly comfortably in the end. Bruin, enjoying a breakout sophomore season, was supported admirably by Houston\u2019s midfield, who were smart enough in possession to thwart Chicago\u2019s few attempts at building sustained pressure.&#xa0;</p> <p>The midfield will be key again today. Sporting play a physical game and like to press forward en masse when momentum permits. The sides that are successful against them tend to operate wide midfielders who are very aware of their defensive duties, which involves pinning back Sporting\u2019s full backs and tucking inside to support their own central midfielders, whose hands will be full with the interchanging runs of Zusi and Kamara, and the dominant play of Espinoza.&#xa0;</p> <p>Which is all to say that Houston\u2019s playoff specialist coach Dom Kinnear, may have a difficult choice on his hands today. He has a home game and could feasibly be tempted to go for it with the 4-3-3 that briefly sparked the side after the arrival of Oscar Boniek Garcia, or more likely he\u2019ll stick with the 4-4-2 and focus on cancelling Sporting out, while hoping his side can pick their moments as they did against Chicago, or pick up the type of set pieces that Brad Davis thrives on. One decision that seems <em>fairly</em> likely is that there will be no place in the starting line up for Mac Kandji. He may well come on as a late sub to chase the game, but as an attacking option against a side like Sporting, his defensive downside should be too great to risk.</p> <p>You can read about Kanji\u2019s potential contribution and more in our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/nov/02/mls-semi-final-fan-previews\">semi-final fan previews</a>&#xa0;(there\u2019s also a more detailed exchange there between myself and regular commenter <strong>MinAmerica</strong> on the Dynamo\u2019s likely line up, for those of you who want to get really wonky, or just want to laugh when I'm wrong).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5096ca3395cb1506d244486d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-04T20:04:03.960Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Welcome to the third of the weekend\u2019s four semi-final first legs, and after last night\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/nov/03/dc-united-new-york-red-bulls-live\">whirl of missed penalties, red cards and own goals at RFK Stadium</a> we\u2019re at Houston\u2019s BBVA Compass stadium this afternoon - as the Dynamo\u2019s brand new home and, so far, fortress, hosts its first ever playoff game, with the visit of Sporting Kansas City.</p> <p>Houston Dynamo come into the game having won their wild-card game against Chicago in midweek, after having rested a number of key players last weekend for their last regular game of the season (when it became apparent that they couldn\u2019t finish above 5th in the East regardless of the score). They\u2019re the lowest remaining seed in MLS Cup, and know that if they are to win the whole thing it will involve playing the final at a Western rival\u2019s stadium. That may be a long way off, but at least Houston know that their unbeaten home record gets to be a factor in the remainder of their campaign, starting today.</p> <p>Sporting meanwhile, are unbeaten on a stretch going back to 28th July, a run that includes wins over both their potential Eastern final opponents, DC United and New York Red Bulls, but that perhaps intriguingly also includes a 1-1 tie with today\u2019s opponents at Sporting\u2019s Livestrong Park home. While today\u2019s game at the BBVA could be crucial, everyone present will have half an eye on what happens in the second leg when these two sides meet again in Kansas City, especially with what happened the last time these two teams met in a playoff situation, in last year\u2019s Eastern Conference final.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aktERV-dms4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aktERV-dms4?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I\u2019ll be back soon with more build up and team news, in the meantime, you can watch the highlights above, read&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/30/mls-cup-previews-2012\">our playoff guide to all the teams</a>, or&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/nov/02/mls-semi-final-fan-previews\">the fan previews for the semi-finals</a>, or perhaps&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/nov/01/mls-playoffs-chicago-fire-houston-dynamo\">how the Dynamo got here</a>&#xa0;in Wednesday night\u2019s game...or just enjoy your ribs, then smear up the phone or the keyboard, as you tweet your thoughts to&#xa0;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/KidWeil\">@KidWeil&#xa0;</a>or email&#xa0;<a href=\"mailto:graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com\">graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com</a>.

  "<p>Giving all doctors annual assessments and detailed checks every five years will result in better care for patients and reduce compensation claims, but may see an exodus of experienced medics from the NHS who are reluctant to be tested, a government study has warned.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/19/doctors-fit-to-practise-tests\" title=\"\">announcement last month</a> that doctors would undergo \"fit to practise\" checks for the first time surprised the medical world after a decade of seemingly fruitless negotiation. The system, called revalidation, will begin in December.</p> <p>In new evidence, the government argues that the cost of the checks \u2013 about \u00a3100m annually \u2013 will be outweighed by benefits to patients and the profession. Better care and fewer court cases against medics will save nearly \u00a31bn over 10 years, so revalidation would almost pay for itself, the government says.</p> <p>The study, released on Tuesday, shows that about one in hundred patients who would have died or suffered harm in the course of being treated would \"be avoided\" because of revalidation. Even more striking is the drop the cost of litigation in cases where doctors are taken to court over mishaps resulting from their care.</p> <p>The Department of Health (DoH) says payouts for medical mistakes has spiralled from \u00a3400m in 2003 to \u00a3860m in 2011. \"The prevention of deaths and incidents of harm, as well as the introduction of a stronger culture of accountability, is expected to result in fewer incidents that would lead to litigation payouts. The data showed that a 3% reduction in future payouts as a result of revalidation can be anticipated,\" said the report.</p> <p>However, the DoH says the new tests may see an exodus of experienced staff from the NHS. \"One possible consequence of revalidation \u2026 is that some doctors may choose to leave the system rather than undergo appraisal and revalidation processes that would be new to them. This may particularly be the case for older doctors, who would take with them many years of experience and expertise.\"</p> <p>Health minister Dan Poulter, who still works a session a week as a hospital doctor, said the UK will be the first country in the world to regularly review its doctors, batting away criticisms that the scheme is too expensive and would divert money from frontline services.</p> <p>\"Revalidation will cost an estimated \u00a3100m each year, or less than 0.1% of the NHS' total budget. The evidence published today shows that this cost is outweighed by the enormous benefits that regular fitness to practise reviews will bring \u2013 increased trust in doctors, safer care, fewer claims for clinical negligence and positive cultural change in the profession,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/06/regular-oversight-doctors-dan-poulter\" title=\"\">he writes in an article for the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>\"As a doctor myself, I welcome this support for my own clinical practice. It will make medicine safer by eliminating poor practice through supporting those doctors who need to improve some of their clinical skills, and by tackling the tiny minority of doctors who are not fit for their roles.\"</p> <p>Poulter says that even the \"best, most qualified doctors can be let down by poor communication. Regular appraisals will target the quality of their bedside manner and include genuine patient feedback, so that all doctors \u2026 are supported to improve their relationship with patients and to build up that essential trust\".</p> <p>The report also pointed out that doctors working outside of the NHS would also face regular check-ups. The DoH says that only one in 20 of the 157,000 practising doctors in England work solely in the private sector. \"The \u2026 data showed that there are considerably lower appraisal rates in the independent sector\".</p> <p>However, the government acknowledges that there will be an extra cost to private health. \"These are costs which might be expected to be passed on to the consumer, who would in turn experience the resulting benefits.\"</p> <p>The General Medical Council will be responsible for revalidation, which will be on the basis of a dossier of evidence of a doctor's competence compiled over five years. This will include annual assessments and patient questionnaires.</p> <p>Negotiations with doctors' leaders at the British Medical Association over how revalidation would be carried out has caused some of the long delays. The BMA has traditionally been wary, while saying that it supports the principle.</p> <p>Plans were under way at the time of the Shipman inquiry in 2005, but Dame Janet Smith, who chaired it, was strongly critical, saying the proposals would not ensure that failing and bad doctors were picked up, so they had to be reworked.</p>"
