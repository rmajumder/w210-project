  "<p>In a last-ditch attempt to overturn the award of the west coast rail franchise to FirstGroup, Virgin Trains co-owner Sir Richard Branson has offered to run the service \"for free\" to allow time for parliamentary scrutiny of the decision.</p> <p>Virgin also renewed its threat to seek a judicial review before the deadline of Tuesday night when contracts are due to be signed by the Department for Transport (DfT), although it hopes pressure from within the Conservative party may sway the transport secretary, Justine Greening, where Labour voices and public petitioning have failed.</p> <p>The DfT said it had \"no reason\" to delay signing off the franchise, which will give FirstGroup, Britain's largest rail operator, the right to run services between London and cities north to Glasgow until at least 2026. FirstGroup bid \u00a35.5bn, according to the DfT, \u00a3700m more than Virgin, the incumbent and closest shortlisted bidder.</p> <p>The actual payments will top \u00a310bn after inflation, more than \u00a31bn above Virgin's offer. Branson and several City analysts have questioned whether the level of FirstGroup's bid is sustainable or if risks a repeat of high-bidding franchisees not seeing out their contracts.</p> <p>Branson on Sunday called for an independent audit of the decision, particularly to check the forecasts of customer numbers, revenue and payments offered to the government. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he said: \"If this process means extending the current franchise beyond December for a few months, I and my partners at Stagecoach would happily run the extended franchise on a not-for-profit basis, or donate profits to charity. We must ensure that this crucial decision is taken with all the facts correctly assessed and understood.\"</p> <p>A DfT spokesman said: \"We note the offer that one of the bidders appears to have made via the press. However, the winning bidder was decided by a fair and established process and no reason has been advanced to convince DfT not to sign the agreement.\"</p> <p>A Virgin source said it had been making its case at \"all levels\" of the Conservative party, and MPs were making representations to Greening. The source said: \"When we lost CrossCountry to Arriva in 2007 we lost fair and square, by a narrow margin. This is a different ball game altogether, a margin verging on 15% with all the money coming in at the end.\"</p> <p>The offer to run it for free meant that there was \"no rush, and no need for it to be signed off in August. Let it be properly scrutinised by parliament and we'll abide by the decision.\"</p> <p>An online petition started by a Scottish rail passenger calling on the DfT to reconsider has garnered more than 128,000 signatures, a number that all but guarantees a parliamentary debate, although it is unlikely to be held until long after the contract is signed. The transport select committee is planning to question Greening soon over the agreement after its own chair's attempts to delay the award to allow scrutiny were rebuffed.</p> <p>The Virgin source said: \"If this had just been Richard ranting, it would have died off by now. But these are not acolytes \u2013 these are people looking independently saying, we don't believe these figures.\"</p> <p>FirstGroup is confident the franchise will be formalised by Wednesday and views Branson's reaction as confirmation that the railway line is lucrative enough to support the high premium payments it has promised to pay the government. A source close to the company said: \"Our deal represented the best deal for the British taxpayer. We don't have a history of mobilising celebrities, but we do have history of running successful railways.\"</p> <p>He said Branson's offer to keep running the line for a short period was \"neither practical nor feasible\" and added: \"We fully expect the process to be completed this week with the signing of the franchise and we look forward to running west coast trains on December 9.\"</p>",
  "<p>So Tottenham Hotspur's season can now begin. By the time they play Norwich City on Saturday, the transfer window will have closed, their squad will be complete and all the muttering and manoeuvring in the background will have ceased. The trouble is they will not be able to recover the two games that have slipped away. Again.</p> <p>It was difficult to ignore the ghosts of the recent past at White Hart Lane, and not only because of Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto's gloriously off-message answer to the question of whether Harry Redknapp's sacking in June had been a surprise. \"Yeah, I was very surprised,\" the Tottenham left-back said. \"Very surprised because I don't think there are a lot of managers who finished fourth and they are sacked so \u2026 I was surprised, yeah.\"</p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas has replaced Redknapp but the similarities to the beginning of last season are plentiful. Luka Modric wants a transfer and he is in no frame of mind to play; uncertainty clings to the future of other players; the club's incoming business is unresolved. Under Redknapp last season, Tottenham lost their opening Premier League fixtures to Manchester United and City and, following the latter, he bemoaned \"a feeling round the place \u2026 for me, it's not been right\".</p> <p>The mood has been more upbeat under Villas-Boas and, as he pointed out, the team have one more point than last season, even if this draw against an upwardly mobile West Bromwich Albion represented a disappointment after the defeat at Newcastle United last Saturday. Albion were full value for James Morrison's injury-time equaliser that cancelled out Assou-Ekotto's 25-yard deflected drive.</p> <p>Tottenham's slick and incisive moves in the first half only lacked a cutting edge in front of goal but the overriding impression was that something was missing. The crowd sensed it; for the opening home game of the season, the atmosphere was surprisingly flat for periods. It was West Brom who finished with the bit between their teeth. They were rampant for the last 10 minutes or so, with Tottenham clinging on desperately before they were breached by Morrison's nonchalant side-foot.</p> <p>Tottenham anticipate a busy week leading to Friday night's transfer deadline and, given their propensity to leave things late, there is no guarantee that any new signings will be cleared to face Norwich. The striker Emmanuel Adebayor, a substitute against West Brom after signing on Tuesday, should be closer to match fitness.</p> <p>Modric's composure was missed and Villas-Boas said that the midfielder's transfer to Real Madrid was \"just a question of time\". It feels as though the deal will be announced when Tottenham have secured a replacement.</p> <p>Villas-Boas might reflect that he needs time and there was no sense of alarm at the club's poor start.</p> <p>\"Look at how we started last season and we ended up finishing fourth,\" Assou-Ekotto said. \"I am not worrying at the moment. We haven't changed much from last season and maybe we will have one or two new players. We are a good team and I will not think that we can't finish fourth.\"</p> <p>Steve Clarke was determined to manage expectations after the dream start to his managerial career at West Brom. Getting to 40 points, the accepted survival cut-off, remained the priority, he said. He was also determined to avoid building up Romelu Lukaku, the on-loan Chelsea striker, whose impact at White Hart Lane as a 63rd-minute substitute was immense. Lukaku had been a goalscoring substitute in the opening day home win against Liverpool.</p> <p>Clarke missed the injured Peter Odemwingie at Tottenham but Lukaku's power and menace has given him a selection teaser. \"I think he will kill me if I use him as an impact sub,\" Clarke said, with a smile.</p> <p>Clarke has found the job all-consuming. The golf and his love of fly-fishing have gone by the wayside. \"Two games in, and I can say I'm enjoying it,\" he said. \"But I am realistic enough to know that there can be many different Saturdays.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Claudio Yacob (West Bromwich Albion).</p>",
  "<p>They have got here in different ways. Half of the six were born with their disabilities while the others suffered accidents or illness. Some have sailed since they were children, others only took to it in later life.</p> <p>But all six will be looking to make history. Surprisingly, for a nation with a proud seafaring tradition and a fine Olympic record, GB's sailors have failed to win a single medal since the sport became a full Paralympic event in 2000. The class of 2012 are intending not only to win medals but to do all they can to make sure they are gold ones. \"We want the gold medal,\" Hannah Stodel, the tactician in the Sonar keelboat, said. \"We only want one medal. Any other medal would be rubbish for us. That's what gets us out of bed in the morning.\"</p> <p>Three types of keelboat sail in the Paralympic regatta. The Sonar is a three-person boat, and two people, at least one a woman, race in the Skud-18. A single sailor of either sex competes in a tricky little boat called the 2.4mR. Up to 80 sailors will be taking part at the London 2012 regatta from 23 nations. The giants of the sport include Germany, who top the overall medal table, France, the USA, Australia and Canada. But nations not as well known for Olympic or Paralympic sailing such as Puerto Rico, Malaysia and Japan will also be represented.</p> <p>Athletes have a wide range of disabilities and the boats are specially adapted to try to make sure all can compete on level terms. Some, for example, are fitted with foot pedals that control the tiller. Tilting seats or pulley systems are can be used to make sure the sailor is in the right place. Competitors in the small 2.4mR sit down low in the boat with all the controls to trim the sails and steer within arms' reach. A complex classification system based on an athlete's ability to perform tasks on the boat is designed to ensure fairness.</p> <p>The Sonar trio is GB's most experienced Paralympic sailing outfit, having competed together in Athens and Beijing, finishing sixth both times. Stodel said the trio were \"heartbroken\" to do so poorly at Beijing and thought about going their separate ways. \"We should have medalled and we didn't. We let ourselves down, we let other people down,\" she said.</p> <p>Their \"greatest\" moment came when they sat down together to discuss their future and decided to stick together and campaign for London 2012. \"That's more powerful for me than anything because we committed to each other,\" Stodel said.</p> <p>Asked to described the team dynamic, Stodel comes up with \"random\". Born without a right forearm, she began sailing aged three on the Essex coast and became GB's first woman sailing Paralympian. John Robertson, the helm and at 40 the oldest member of the ParalympicsGB sailing team, is a former weapons technician on Harrier jump jets, who uses a wheelchair following a motorcycle accident. He also had sailed since he was a boy.</p> <p>The third member of the team is Welshman Stephen Thomas, who was a keen rugby player as a young man but came to sailing after losing his legs below the knees when he contracted meningococcal septicaemia. A fierce competitor, as he lay in his hospital bed he began dreaming of taking part in the Paralympics.</p> <p>In the Skud-18, Niki Birrell and Alex Rickham make a fascinating pair. Birrell, who has cerebral palsy, was an excellent able-bodied sailor, campaigning in the 470 Olympic class with his brother before concentrating on the Paralympics. Rickham was paralysed after suffering a spinal injury when she dived into shallow water in her native Jamaica. She tried sailing as part of her rehabilitation and teamed up with Birrell just months before Beijing. They came a creditable sixth place and are tipped to go better this time.</p> <p>Rickham's injury means that her body's thermostat does not work properly. She typically wears five layers on top and three below, plus a balaclava. She has to be careful about how much she drinks because it is tricky for a wheelchair athlete to answer a call of nature while on board.</p> <p>The sixth member of the GB team, Helena Lucas, has taken part in both Olympic and Paralympic campaigns. She was born without thumbs but became one of GB's most talented sailors and won a silver medal in the 2006 Olympic test event in Beijing in the Yngling class. \"I've grown up just finding my own way to do things,\" Lucas, who finished seventh in Beijing, said. \"I was disappointed but I think I learnt some very valuable lessons.\"</p> <p>Of course, the regatta is not just about the GB sailors. There are many compelling characters from other nations. Such as the Israeli Sonar team, all of whom were left disabled while serving in the military. Australia's Liesl Tesch will also be worth watching in the Skud. She is a multiple Paralympian medal winner \u2013 but in basketball rather than sailing.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see if the Paralympic regatta grips the imagination in the same way the Olympic one did. The Nothe spectator area, a hit during the Olympics, has been dismantled. The Paralympics regatta takes place within Portland Harbour and can be viewed (binoculars recommended) from the shore. Sporting activities, which proved popular during the Olympics, are being staged on Weymouth beach.</p> <p>Though Ben Ainslie and the rest won a total of five medals at the Olympics, the team were a little disappointed to slip behind both Australia and Spain in the medals table. It may be time for their Paralympic counterparts to shine.</p>",
  "<p>Italy's Alex Zanardi could have one key advantage when he lines up with Paralympic cyclists on the course at Brands Hatch next week. The former Formula One driver knows the track inside out from his days driving round it at 200mph.</p> <p>\"Last time I was here I was going about five times faster but I still love this circuit,\" said Zanardi, 45, who has fought back from a horrific crash in 2001 that cost him his legs and is now aiming for Paralympic gold riding a three-wheeled hand bike.</p> <p>Zanardi's comeback is all the more incredible considering doctors never understood how he survived the side-on impact in a Champ Car race at Germany's Lausitz track 11 years ago that left him with less than a litre of blood in his body.</p> <p>Pulling out of a pit stop, Zanardi lost control and stalled on the track, forcing one driver to swerve round him before the Canadian driver Alex Tagliani collided with him at 217mph, hitting Zanardi's Reynard-Honda at its most vulnerable point behind the front wheel \u2013 slicing car and driver in two.</p> <p>\"What saved me was the clean break,\" said Zanardi, whose legs were severed above the knees. \"I could have easily died right there from the impact.\"</p> <p>After losing three-quarters of his blood and undergoing reanimation seven times, doctors were amazed he was still clinging on to life after being taken by helicopter to a Berlin hospital.</p> <p>\"They compared my injuries to a Nasa study that charts the critical point beyond which a human body cannot survive and told me I was officially a dead man,\" said Zanardi, a two-times Champ Car racing champion who also drove for the Lotus Formula One team.</p> <p>The Bologna-born driver was determined to compete again the moment he woke from his coma. \"The first thing I asked myself was 'How am I going to do all the things I want to do with no legs?'\"</p> <p>Within nine months Zanardi was racing again, switching to the World Touring Car Championship and racking up wins.</p> <p>\"To drive the BMW 320 I convinced the team to create a special brake pedal that I could use with my prosthetic leg,\" he said. \"Having no legs doesn't mean you can't drive fast and I wasn't going to be happy scoring the odd point, I thought it was possible to win and went for it.\"</p> <p>Zanardi used his knowledge of racing car design to build his own prosthetic legs, even producing a special set to allow him to go swimming with his son. \"If you take your legs off to swim you enter the pool like a sack of potatoes, so I changed the knee joints to make them corrosion proof and coated the legs with the same natural-looking foam we line racing car fuel tanks with to stop the fuel moving around.\"</p> <p>Looking for new challenges, Zanardi discovered hand bikes, where the pedals are turned by hands, not feet, and he took fourth place in the hand bike section of the New York City Marathon in 2007 after training for just four weeks.</p> <p>Then, in 2009, he retired from car racing with the aim of making Italy's hand bike team for London 2012, last year winning the New York marathon at his fourth attempt, where he narrowly beat Poland's Rafal Wilk, a former speedway racer who lost his legs in an accident.</p> <p>Relying on his experience as a test driver and calling on the expertise of friends in the car racing business, Zanardi has built his bike from scratch, using the on-board monitors that are now common in the sport to download and analyse data from training sessions.</p> <p>\"It's not much different to Formula One where they are improving the cars constantly,\" he said. \"The difference is every hand biker needs a different bike depending on their residual ability,\" he said.</p> <p>Zanardi moulded a carbon-fibre seat to fit perfectly around his rear and what remains of his legs \"like a Cinderella shoe\", helping him reach sprint speeds of over 37mph in practice ahead of the Paralympics, where a 15.5km time trial and 64km road race will send riders around the Brands Hatch course and out on to open roads.</p> <p>Hand bikers will race in one of four categories determined by the extent of their disability. \"I am H4, able to use my back so I can lean forward and get my body weight behind the pedalling,\" Zanardi said. \"People who can't move their back will be H1 to H3, and ride in a reclined position. They cannot use their body weight but they do get an aerodynamic advantage which makes them more efficient on the flat.\"</p> <p>If Zanardi can win gold, it will be down to his grit and determination as much as his bike. \"My parents taught me that I could always improve on things,\" he said. \"After my crash I never doubted it would be hard but I would be lying to say this new life has been a surprise to me. I did it because I thought it was possible.</p> <p>\"If some people could fly, Usain Bolt would feel disabled,\" he said. \"Doing the best with what I have is the biggest challenge.\"</p> <p>In a twist of fate, Zanardi's older sister died in a car crash when he was a child, prompting his parents to attempt to keep the boy off the roads. \"Knowing I was passionate about engines they gave me a go-kart so that I could fulfil my desire for speed in a controlled environment,\" he said. \"And that is how I got started in racing.\"</p> <p>Laughing, he said: \"Now I know that if I break a leg, all I need is a five millimetre screw to fix it.\"</p>",
  "<p>As speculation about a Greek exit from the eurozone continues, Germany is pushing ahead with plans for a new treaty that will transform the European Union.</p> <p>According to this week's Spiegel, Angela Merkel wants European leaders to agree by the end of the year to hold a constitutional convention in order to fashion a new legal basis for the EU \u2013 even though most other member states are opposed to the idea of another&#xa0;tortuous and risky treaty negotiation so soon after the failed European constitution and the Lisbon treaty. The plan could dramatically reshape the EU&#xa0;in Germany's image \u2013 or&#xa0;lead to it falling apart.</p> <p>On Friday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/24/angela-merkel-rejects-greek-pleas-loan-extension\" title=\"\">Merkel rejected Greece's plea</a> for more time to implement austerity measures while affirming that&#xa0;she still wanted it to remain in the euro. There had been some signs that German anger about Greece had dissipated \u2013 Bild published a surprisingly positive interview with the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, last week \u2013 but at the same time confidence is growing that a Greek exit from the euro could be contained. Figures such as Volker Kauder, the parliamentary leader of the Christian Democrats, and Philipp R\u00f6sler, vice-chancellor and leader of the Free Democrats, the junior partner in Merkel's coalition government, have said they no longer fear a Greek exit.</p> <p>However, the debate in Germany is now moving beyond Greece towards the question of political union. During the two and a half years since the euro crisis began, Germany's approach has been to seek to impose its own economic preferences on the eurozone. It insisted that all eurozone countries agree to enact an equivalent of the constitutional amendment it passed in 2009, which required it to maintain balanced budgets. Many, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/29/euro-summit-europe-problems\" title=\"\">Guardian leader writers</a>, have seen in Germany's approach a kind of economic imperialism. But Germany seems to be coming to the conclusion that it is no longer enough to try to remake the eurozone in Germany's image in economic terms; it must do so in political terms as well.</p> <p>Although Germany has often been accused of doing too little too late for the eurozone periphery, many Germans think they have already done too much too soon. They perceive a creeping mutualisation of debt, in which they are assuming liability without control \u2013 in other words, throwing astronomical sums of money into a bottomless pit without being able to enforce austerity measures or to stop eurozone leaders such as Fran\u00e7ois Hollande from taking steps to change the retirement age, for instance, from 62 to 60. As a result, there has been increasing anger in Germany at the bailouts. (The German constitutional court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Stability_Mechanism\" title=\"\">European Stability Mechanism</a>, the eurozone's \u20ac500bn rescue fund, on 12 September.)</p> <p>Many Germans see the idea of a more extensive and permanent form of debt mutualisation \u2013 for instance in the form of eurobonds \u2013 as the creation of a \"debt union\" in which they and other surplus countries would assume unlimited liability for deficit countries' debt while giving up what leverage they have to enforce structural reform. Germany's constitutional court has already ruled that open-ended debt mutualisation of&#xa0;this kind would violate the Basic Law \u2013 the federal republic's constitution.</p> <p>The European summit in June, at which Hollande, along with Italian and&#xa0;Spanish prime ministers Mario Monti and Mariano Rajoy, forced Merkel&#xa0;to allow the ESM to directly bail&#xa0;out troubled eurozone banks, was&#xa0;a&#xa0;turning&#xa0;point in German attitudes&#xa0;to&#xa0;the euro crisis.</p> <p>In much of the rest of the eurozone \u2013 and the world \u2013 it was seen as a breakthrough. The summit was, <a href=\"http://centreforeuropeanreform.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/has-eurozone-reached-limits-of.html\" title=\"\">as one economist put it</a>, \"the first to agree measures that address the core of the crisis: inflated government borrowing costs that weaken public finances and ultimately make sovereign insolvency self-fulfilling; and a vicious cycle in which worries about bank and sovereign solvency feed on and amplify each other\".</p> <p>In Germany, however, the summit \u2013 which took place on the day that Italy knocked Germany out of Euro 2012 \u2013 was&#xa0;widely seen as a defeat. From a German perspective, Merkel had given in to demands from the eurozone periphery for even more of their money while weakening the strict conditionality on which Germany had always insisted. It was, according to the Spiegel, \"the night Merkel lost\". Against this background, there are now calls for a referendum \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/world/europe/referendum-on-europe-gains-support-in-germany.html\" title=\"\">the buzzword of the summer in Germany</a> \u2013 to replace the Basic Law with a new constitution.</p> <p>Supporters of \"more Europe\", such as J\u00fcrgen Habermas, would use the process to argue for changes that could overcome the limitations set by the courts on debt mutualisation. Their opponents would see it as a chance to block further European integration.</p> <p>Even with Merkel's plan to accelerate the timetable for a new treaty, there is a big question mark over whether an as yet undefined form of political union can be agreed quickly enough to save the euro. Just as Germany has sought to impose its economic preferences on the rest of the eurozone, it is now also likely to seek to impose its political preferences, based on the lessons it has drawn from its own history. In other words, it will seek to reshape Europe as a&#xa0;larger version of its own federal system, which has a relatively weak executive constrained by strict rules and a strong parliament and judiciary.</p> <p>However, even if it is successful in doing this, it is by no means clear that the German people would vote in favour of accepting full liability for eurozone debt. Influential figures such as economist <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d5efc38a-d64b-11e1-b547-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fd5efc38a-d64b-11e1-b547-00144feabdc0.html&amp;_i_referer=#axzz24aPAMT4t\" title=\"\">Otmar Issing</a> are opposed to political union, and some polls suggest a majority of Germans are opposed to further integration and even want Germany to leave the euro altogether.</p> <p>What some in Germany see as a way to enable \"more Europe\" may turn out to be the catalyst for the disintegration of the EU.</p>",

  "<p>This was not really a clash of two systems \u2013 rather, it was about both trying to become comfortable in their own. Last season, Manchester City had the Premier League's best defensive record and Liverpool's was joint third but both have conceded multiple goals in their first two matches following a change in approach.</p> <p>Liverpool's alteration is a modification of philosophy rather than a specific defensive tweak \u2013 Brendan Rodgers insists on short-passing football and a high defensive line. A combination of these two factors meant Sebasti\u00e1n Coates started ahead of Jamie Carragher in the absence of Daniel Agger, who was suspended because of a foul against West Brom that stemmed from Liverpool's struggle with a high line.</p> <p>This was a better performance, but problems remain: Rodgers must have momentarily been worried that such defending was going to result in another red card when Martin Skrtel clumsily hauled down Mario Balotelli as the striker sprinted in behind. Coates was into a good covering position, which meant there was no dismissal \u2013 but also demonstrates that the Uruguayan is suited to this system, being both calm and positionally astute.</p> <p>With the ball, Coates was caught out by Balotelli in the first half, while Skrtel's error for Carlos Tevez's goal was almost too ludicrous to explain rationally but it cannot be entirely divorced from Rodgers' instructions.</p> <p>This merely represents a period of adjustment, however, and Rodgers knows Liverpool will benefit from the approach in the long term. Even at this early stage, Liverpool's passing at the back gave them control of the game and brought City up the pitch, allowing Liverpool's forwards space to attack into.</p> <p>Fabio Borini, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Raheem Sterling enjoyed running at City's three-man backline, an experiment that Roberto Mancini tried throughout pre-season. He also used that system in the Community Shield win over Chelsea, although the fact Roberto Di Matteo's side played most of that game with 10 men may have flattered the formation.</p> <p>As a Plan B it may be useful, but it is difficult to understand the true benefit of the 3-4-1-2. For now, it means City can field one fewer attacking player (David Silva spent the first 75 minutes on the bench) and are less secure defensively. Even if one accepts Mancini's determination to stay ahead by preventing his side becoming predictable, it was a surprise to see Kolo Tour\u00e9 favoured over Joleon Lescott, which also meant Pablo Zabaleta being used on the left.</p> <p>Liverpool took a while to work out City's system but eventually Rodgers encouraged his side higher up the pitch, and the pressing was effective as three attackers closed down three City defenders. When City worked the ball past that pressure, Liverpool's wide forwards dropped deeper and Sterling was highly impressive on the left. His boundless energy meant he was able to occupy two City players \u2013 he defended against James Milner, who pushed high up, and then attacked Kolo Tour\u00e9. The Ivorian looked uncomfortable in wide positions, furthering the intrigue about why Zabaleta was not entrusted with that role.</p> <p>Sterling was less dangerous in the second half \u2013 which is not a criticism, more a recognition of his brilliance before the break \u2013 partly because such a high-energy game simply is not sustainable over 90 minutes.</p> <p>Mancini tinkered with his system \u2013 Yaya Tour\u00e9 moved higher up and grabbed a goal and City had reverted to a back four shortly before their second equaliser, but both goals were scrappy and owed much to poor Liverpool defending. Rodgers' system will not change but Mancini will consider switching to a more familiar formation against QPR on Saturday.</p> <h2>Getting the best out of Olivier Giroud</h2> <p>Olivier Giroud demonstrated that he's a fine goalscorer for Montpellier last season, but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will have studied his link-up play just as closely before signing him. Arsenal aren't yet taking advantage of his main quality, however \u2013 his ability to play clever one-touch lay-offs with his back to goal. <br>The Frenchman frequently received the ball with no-one directly behind him, as Gervinho and Lukas Podolski generally stayed in wide positions, and Santi Cazorla dropped into deeper positions to orchestrate play. There was no-one bursting forward from midfield to support Giroud, and he often looked isolated and uncomfortable against Stoke's physical backline.</p> <p>Podolski drifted infield a couple of times and could be used as a second striker, but Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain might be a better option than Arsenal's other wide options, Theo Walcott and Gervinho. He is similarly direct with the ball, but more naturally runs into central positions, and Arsenal will need midfield runners to share the goalscoring burden in the absence of Robin van Persie.</p> <h2>In praise of Leighton Baines</h2> <p>In an unusually positive start to the season for Everton, Leighton Baines has enjoyed a particularly good opening to the campaign. Against Manchester United last week, Baines' measured chips forward to Marouane Fellaini accounted for Everton's main passing combination and was the key to unsettling United's unfamiliar backline. </p> <p>This weekend, he and Phil Neville constantly motored forward, pushing Aston Villa's wide players back towards their own goal. He also had a hand in Nikica Jelavic's goal, following some good work down the left. He's already created 13 chances for teammates this season, more than any other player in the league.</p> <p>He's also the biggest beneficiary from Steven Pienaar's permanent return to the club. The South African drifts inside into clever central playmaking positions \u2013 and he can shoot excellently, as shown by his goal on Saturday \u2013 and Baines overlaps readily. Their partnership down the left is arguably the best in the Premier League.</p> <p><em>Michael Cox is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.zonalmarking.net/\">zonalmarking.net</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Joshua Trevi\u00f1o is an unashamed American rightwing and Republican polemicist whose role as a commentator for the Guardian US website <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/9\" title=\"\">was announced on 15 August 2012</a>. Nine days later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/10\" title=\"\">in a joint statement by Trevi\u00f1o and the Guardian</a>, it was announced that his freelance contract had been ended by mutual agreement.</p> <p>Between those two dates there was an extremely powerful campaign on the web attacking his role, which, as a former speech writer for the George W Bush administration, was envisaged by the Guardian as someone who would give insight into the Republican campaign.</p> <p>The attacks were led chiefly by the Electronic Intifada website and heavily supported by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign and its members. The Guardian readers' editor's office had received almost 200 complaints by the end of last week. In the first 24 hours the complaints turned on a tweet posted by Trevi\u00f1o on 25 June 2011: \"Dear IDF: If you end up shooting any Americans on the new Gaza flotilla \u2013 well, most Americans are cool with that. Including me.\" This was seen by the complainants as an incitement to shoot Americans taking part in a flotilla of boats that planned to break the blockade of Gaza in 2011. An attempt in 2010 to break the blockade ended with the interception of the boats by the Israelis and the deaths of nine protesters.</p> <p>While the remit of the Guardian's readers' editor is wide ranging, I did not feel that a tweet from a private account before he was contracted to the Guardian fell within it.</p> <p>However, as a result of the first flush of complaints, Trevi\u00f1o <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/aug/16/2011-gaza-flotilla-tweet-clarification\" title=\"\">wrote a blogpost</a> for the Guardian's US site on 16 August, which he described as a clarification. In it he recognised that this particular tweet might lead people to believe he was inciting the IDF to shoot Americans but he strongly denied this \u2013 three times \u2013 in the article. He wrote: \"I urged no such thing. I&#xa0;intended no such thing. But sufficient numbers believe I did, and in cases of widespread misapprehension of meaning, the fault always lies with the writer.\" He also apologised for giving \"the impression that I welcome killing\".</p> <p>This triggered a further complaint from Ali Abunimah, co-founder of the Electronic Intifada, that this latest Trevi\u00f1o article was inaccurate because there was ample evidence from other tweets to show that Trevi\u00f1o did mean to encourage the shooting of Americans in that flotilla. As this complaint relates to a current piece of journalism on the Guardian website, this falls within the readers' editor's remit.</p> <p>I have reviewed Abunimah's complaint. While I think it likely that a reasonable person might well believe this was the intent of the tweet, I don't think it is possible to make an objective finding of inaccuracy about his denial. The tweet states clearly that he would be \"cool\" ie relaxed about them being shot. In the article he denies absolutely that he meant this to be taken as an encouragement to the IDF to kill Americans. I believe the complaint would require a judgment on Trevi\u00f1o's sincerity: a matter of opinion, not a decision based on factual accuracy.</p> <p>There was a second complaint on Thursday 23 August received by senior editorial staff in the US and referred to the readers' editor. This concerns another blogpost Trevi\u00f1o had written as a contributor to the Guardian's US site \u2013 before he was on contract \u2013 on 28 February 2011 about a Republican congressman's inquiry into Islamic radicalisation, which quoted the Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak.</p> <p>Until shortly before this blogpost, the author had been a consultant for an agency retained by Malaysian business interests and ran a website called Malaysia Matters, which should have led to a footnote disclosing the relationship. Failure to declare a potential conflict of interest is a breach of the Guardian's editorial code. This relationship will now be footnoted on the blogpost and, as the article was not in print, a correction included in the Guardian's online corrections and clarifications. A Guardian spokesperson said that following this disclosure, both Trevi\u00f1o and the Guardian agreed to end the contract.</p> <p>This has been a bruising 10 days for the Guardian that could have been handled better. Some of the issues were already in the public domain and could have been addressed earlier.</p> <p>Janine Gibson, editor-in-chief of Guardian US, said: \"We didn't know about the tweet. Trevino has a combative and prolific Twitter presence \u2013 there are something like 81,000 tweets. When it was drawn to our attention, we too were horrified and asked for an explanation. He assured us that it was a casual and horrendous use of language on social media.</p> <p>\"Sharing that explanation with our readers, while never going to change anyone's mind, was the most open way, we felt, of acknowledging what was a reprehensible tweet and allowing us to focus on what we had engaged him to do, which was, on the eve of the Republican convention and in the middle of an already vicious and highly partisan election campaign, explain and analyse the politics of the US Republican party.</p> <p>\"This has been an eye-opening week. We knew that there are dangers inherent in attempting to be fair minded and allow our opponents as well as our friends a voice and we have learned several lessons. But I hope we will continue to try and find ways to engage with honestly held philosophies and opinions.\"</p>",
  "<p>The sell-out crowd did not have all that much to cheer, not that it stopped them. The Birmingham Diamond League meeting was more of an after-party for the Olympics, with each British performance, good, bad or indifferent, received with rapturous rounds of applause. Here, perhaps, was the first flourishing of the legacy that the London Organising Committee had promised the Games would deliver. It will be interesting to see how long it lasts.</p> <p>Mo Farah ambled through all but the last 200m of his two-mile race, winning in 8min 27.25sec. Farah trailed his old training partner Chris Thompson for the last kilometre or so, before kicking for the line like a driver finally given a chance to overtake after an hour or so stuck trailing a caravan on the bank holiday run to Cornwall. The best British performance of the day came from Robbie Grabarz, who won the high jump by being the only man to clear 2.32m. Grabarz had already beaten the Olympic champion Ivan Ukhoz, and then asked for the bar to be raised to 2.38 so he could make an attempt at the British record. He did not make it, but he still wore a broad smile on his face.</p> <p>With good reason, too. The victory took Grabarz to the top of the Diamond League standings for the season. He is one point ahead of the USA's Jesse Williams, who finished last here, his form having completely deserted him. If Grabarz beats Williams again in the final meet of the season in Zurich on Thursday, he will win $50,000 (\u00a331,000). For a man who was so broke at the start of the season that he joked he was occasionally reduced to ferreting around in rubbish bins to find something to snack on, it would be quite a haul. Grabarz had his funding cut at the end of 2011, and scraped a living through winter, training here at the Alexander Stadium.</p> <p>\"I was pretty skint come January,\" Grabarz said. \"It was a matter of jump high and you will survive, and I did. I feel like I deserve it, I worked my arse off for it. It is even more fun than I thought it would be.\" That jackpot, he said, would be \"about $50,000 more than I earned last season. And I wish I was joking.\"</p> <p>Christine Ohuruogu did not do quite so well, finishing second to Jamaica's Rosemarie Whyte in the 400m. Ohuruogu can be a little surly at the best of times but even she did not seem to mind too much. \"The British crowd are pretty spectacular and they help to lift any event,\" she said. \"I was really proud to be able to compete here.\"</p> <p>Greg Rutherford also had a bit of an off-day, although his leap of 7.88m was, surprisingly, good enough for third place in a dismal long jump competition. Russia's Aleksandr Menkov was the only man to clear 8m. Next best was the world and Olympic triple jump champion Christian Taylor, who managed 7.95.</p> <p>Rutherford only took his first two jumps, then left to have treatment on his groin, which was \"feeling a little tight\", before returning for a foul in the sixth round. He leapt like a man struggling with a hangover, which, in a way, he was. \"I haven't stopped since the Olympics at all, there's no respite,\" Rutherford said. \"I've been so busy, it's been unbelievable. I've pretty much been living in London, I've hardly been home at all. But it's been wonderful, it has really been such a nice experience.\" He was presented to the crowd at Old Trafford on Saturday, before Manchester United's match against Fulham, when he was a little overshadowed by Usain Bolt, who was there too.</p> <p>Perri Shakes-Drayton finished second in the 400m hurdles, and, in an echo of her own Olympic experience, was briefly bumped up to first after Kaliese Spencer was disqualified, and then knocked back down to second when the Jamaican was reinstated. Two weeks ago Shakes-Drayton was out, then in, then out of the Olympic final in similar circumstances. Her 54.08sec was the third-fastest of her career, after times she ran at Crystal Palace just before the Games and in Lausanne just after them. She needs to learn the knack of peaking when it matters.</p> <p>Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce does not have that problem. She has lost to Carmelita Jeter in both 100 metre races she has run since the Games, but given that she beat her rival in the Olympic final she probably is not too bothered. Jeter ran 10.81sec here, a new stadium record, while Fraser-Pryce was second in 10.90. The men's 200m was won by Jamaica's Nickel Ashmeade in 20.12sec, which put him just ahead of Tyson Gay. Adam Gemili was sixth, in a new personal best of 20.53. Lawrence Okoye finished fourth in the discus, another encouraging result for a man who is still considering whether or not to continue with the sport as he starts a law degree at Oxford University.</p>",
  "<p>In death Tony Scott seems so much more sad, human, and complicated than any of his films. His work was an explosion caught in the hubcaps of flipped Ferraris, finding little time for the darkness that took his life. </p> <p>He come closest, perhaps, with the famous scene in True Romance, where a captive Dennis Hopper lights up a Chesterfield and calmly delivers, to the sound of The Flower Duet by Delibes, a long, languidly insulting riff about Sicilians and Moors <a href=\"http://www.telly.com/C6QXG?fromtwitvid=1\">to an incredulous Christopher Walken</a>, prompting will-you-get-the-balls-on-this-guy laughter and a bullet to the head.</p> <p>Then there was Scott's unwise plan to remake The Wild Bunch, Sam Peckinpah's blood-soaked, vainglorious epic \u2013 one of many projects cut short when Scott jumped off the Vincent Thomas bridge in San Pedro on Monday.</p> <p>The last week has seen an overflow of tributes to Scott, whose love of fast cars, even faster jet engines and high-octane audiovisional flash were the very embodiment of 80s bling. The idea of a Tony Scott movie, in fact, was always far preferable to actually watching a Tony Scott movie, an experience roughly comparable to that of having your eyeballs and eardrums mistaken for a percussion set by a passing Mariachi band. </p> <p>Any highlight reel would have to include Scott's two brushes with Quentin Tarantino, True Romance and Crimson Tide (Tarantino scripted the first and polished the second), and of course Top Gun, Scott's Wordsworthian ode to mankind's eternal need for speed, the joys of being top dog, and the sight of jet-engine tailfins shimmering in the haze of magic hour.</p> <p>\"You're a great flier. You fly cowboy-style. Reckless, wild, out of formation half the time,\" Tom Skerritt informs Tom Cruise's Maverick. \"You buck the system and do everything the hard way.\" Many heroes in the Bruckheimer/Simpson mould would like to think of themselves as mavericks, or would be rumored to be mavericks, but Maverick is the only one to come out with it and actually be called Maverick. That was the essence of 'High Concept', a fancy name for any idea pithy and punchy enough to survive the \"aggressive advocacy and yelling system\" that had sprung up at Paramount at the beginning of the 80s \u2013 an idea in shoulder pads.</p> <p>It produced movies shorn of needless peripherals, strip-mined for their pockets of triumph, and strung out along a beading of radio-ready pop songs: movies that looked, sounded and played like movie pitches. Top Gun begins in triumph, pauses for a victory lap, clocks up a celebration or three, then after a perfunctory setback, proceeds to full on ego massage and reputation floss.</p> <p>\"You're here 'cause you're the top 1%,\" Skerritt tells Cruise. \"You're the elite, the best of the best. We're gonna make you better, because your job is damned important.\" Applications for the navy shot up \u2013 although God knows what they told the poor schnooks who turned up looking for Kelly McGillis with their Kenny Loggins records tucked under their arm.</p> <p>Scott's great subject (and it was a great shame he never saw this) was Hollywood. His style may have been defiantly impersonal, but few bodies of work better speak to the muscular status battles and territorial snit-fits \u2013 the bluff, boast and braggadocio that rule Hollywood \u2013 than Scott's. </p> <p>Beverly Hills Cop II may have been a bad movie about a cop, but it was a good movie about bluffing your way into the fragrant sanctuaries of West Hollywood. Top Gun may be a bad movie about navy pilots, but it is a very good movie about the feeling of exultation that floods your system when your movie about navy pilots becomes the number one movie in America.</p> <p>But then Scott's own story was always better than his movies. If you were to pitch it, it might go something like this: two brothers, fiercely competitive, but united in their desire to escape the industrial gloom of Tyneside's North Shields, finally flee the rain and colliery smoke and make it to London's Royal College of Art. From there they graduate to the world of advertising, but cannot escape the English way of thinking which condemns a search for the finer things in life \u2013 cigars, fine wine, a fling with Brigette Nielson \u2013 as hopelessly arriviste.</p> <p>So they go to Hollywood, which is looking for slick young-bloods like our two brothers. Tony makes The Hunger, an arty vampire flick starring David Bowie with Schubert and Bach on the soundtrack, which dies a death at the box office. Ridley's Alien fills his head with greater glories. Tony is caught briefly in a bar, bemoaning his \"hack\" brother who makes monster movies and \"knows nothing of art\", then beats him to the bottom by making Top Gun. He locks himself into the Bruckheimer/Simpson cockpit, giving a cheeky thumbs up and never looks back. He makes a movie about race cars, nuclear submarines, and runaway trains, until they all shunt into the back of one another in a slow-motion ballet that makes no sense spatially and never breaks its patina of enamelled self-admiration, but looks spiffy in trailers. </p> <p>Scott didn't shoot action so much as aesthetisize chaos. <a href=\"http://ebiri.blogspot.com/2012/08/to-control-something-thats-out-of.html\">As Bilge Eberi put it</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Scott famously cross-bred an amped-up, high-stakes kineticism with a certain romantic quality: He liked to intercut frenzied scenes of violence with elegiac moments, often with dreamy music playing in the background.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Delibes piece playing in background of Dennis Hopper's death-by-Christopher-Walken scene in True Romance was also the music used to advertise British Airways. Scott never lost his advertising roots. He shot images designed to stoke the flame of our acquisitiveness and aspiration. He shot desire. The Hunger should have been the title of all his movies. </p> <p>The world will be a quieter place without him to be sure. In later years he kept Denzel Washington in work, and he was the first to get a proper performance out of Brad Pitt in True Romance, probably Scott's best film. Christian Slater plays a book store clerk who comes by a suitcase full of drugs, who hightails it to Los Angeles with his girl to try and sell the drugs to a movie producer. It all ends in a hail of bullets in a suite at the Ambassador Hotel; bodies fall in slow-motion through a snowstorm of cocaine and feathers, while the producer's latest magnum opus \u2013 a bloody Vietnam pic \u2013 unspools on home movie projector. </p> <p>Dusted with feathers, the corpses looks almost restful, as well they might. They have just been witness to Tony Scott's idea of heaven.</p>",
  "<p>The news that would turn Cindy Corrie's life inside out came around noon on a&#xa0;Sunday in March 2003. She was at home, then in Charlotte, North Carolina, when the phone rang.</p> <p>\"The apartment was kind of a mess, there were papers all over the place, and Craig [her husband] was doing the laundry,\" she recalls in a soft, hesitant voice. On the line was her son-in-law Kelly Simpson, but Cindy could hear her elder daughter Sarah \"crying, just hysterical\" in the background. They had bad news, Kelly said.</p> <p>\"At that point Sarah got on the phone and said: 'It's Rachel.' The first words that came out of my mouth were: 'Is she dead?' I guess I just had to&#xa0;articulate the worst possibility. And Sarah said: 'We think so.'\"</p> <p>Sarah and Kelly had picked up a phone message from a neighbour in the family's home town of Olympia, Washington State, conveying sympathy after hearing about \"the tragedy\" on television. They turned on their TV set to find, scrolling across the bottom of the screen, the words: \"Olympia activist killed in Gaza Strip.\"</p> <p>\"Sarah thought: if it's Rachel, why haven't Mum and Dad called me? Then she thought: they don't know.\" Still holding the phone, Cindy walked across a car park to where her husband was, in the apartment block's laundry room. \"You can't soften something like that. I said: 'It's Sarah and Kelly, and they say Rachel's dead.'\"</p> <p>Rachel Corrie, 23, had been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/mar/23/internationaleducationnews.students\" title=\"\">crushed under an Israeli military bulldozer</a> while trying to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian home in Rafah, at the southernmost end of the Gaza Strip. According to witnesses, the bulldozer's driver had driven straight at her, then reversed over her, even though she was clearly in his line of vision.</p> <p>Rachel was a volunteer for the pro-Palestinian direct action organisation the International Solidarity Movement and the youngest of the Corrie's three children. Her death propelled her family into an almost decade-long battle for accountability and justice. What Cindy describes as \"a milestone\" in that fight will come on Tuesday, when a court in Haifa hands down its verdict in a two-and-a-half year civil lawsuit brought by the Corries against the state&#xa0;of Israel.</p> <p>\"If you had told me 10 years ago that this would happen to us, and I'd do any of the things I have done since that time, that any of us would, I'd say you're crazy \u2013 I won't even breathe again,\" says Cindy. \"Always for parents there's that dread of something happening to a child. I don't even know how to describe how we got through those first minutes and hours.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395262558\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345819294543/Rachel-Corrie-010.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Corrie\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Corrie died trying to stop an Israeli army bulldozer from destroying Palestinian houses in Rafah in 2003.

Asked what Rachel was like, Cindy pauses. \"It's kind of a sad question. You try to hold on to all the memories, but you realise there are things that you lose. Sometimes it's hard to remember.\"</p> <p>But these are some of the ways she describes her daughter: inquisitive, with a rich inner life; creative; an intense observer; an artist; a sympathetic listener; expressive; a constant doodler; able to connect with different people; a&#xa0;poet. \"I always thought that when she came through the front door as an&#xa0;adult, you just knew it was going to&#xa0;be interesting.\"</p> <p>The Corries lived in Olympia, a small&#xa0;community centred round the progressive liberal Evergreen State College, which Rachel later attended. Cindy describes the town as \"politically and environmentally aware\", much like the Corries themselves. \"As a family we were certainly always politically interested, with a lot of discussion going on, but we were not activists, not&#xa0;protesters.\"</p> <p>Cindy, now 64, the oldest of six siblings, grew up in a \"very conservative Lutheran\" household, but describes her own immediate family as&#xa0;\"spiritual\" rather than church-going. They were \"middle-income \u2013 we lived really quite modestly, we were pretty frugal people\". Cindy had rarely been outside the US, certainly never to Europe or the Middle East.</p> <p>By early 2003, Craig Corrie had taken a job in North Carolina, and the couple moved to Charlotte, although always with the intention of returning to their home base in Olympia. \"Like a lot of families, we had just been trying to get our kids through college, and finally we were free of that responsibility. It&#xa0;was like when we were first married&#xa0;\u2013&#xa0;we could decide what to&#xa0;do&#xa0;with our time.\"</p> <p>They hiked in the Appalachian mountains, took driving trips, saw movies. Cindy learned French and played the flute. \"I'm really grateful for&#xa0;that time. It was a quiet time before&#xa0;this really intense period that came after. We spent a lot of time thinking about how we were going to&#xa0;spend the years ahead. It was a&#xa0;pleasant interlude.\"</p> <p>Back in Olympia, following 9/11, their younger daughter was becoming drawn into the burgeoning peace movement and beginning to explore the reasons behind the atrocity. \"That drew her to Israel and Palestine as at least part of the problem,\" says Cindy.</p> <p>As for her parents, \"it wasn't that we&#xa0;weren't interested [in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict], but I think we were just very distanced from it. We knew about it in the way that most Americans did, by listening to news reports. Our sympathies were very much with the Israeli Jewish narrative, because that's what we knew. I read The Diary of Anne Frank to my kids when they were growing up, and that was the narrative we connected with \u2013 and the Palestinian narrative really didn't exist for us.\"</p> <p>But Rachel decided to volunteer as an activist for the Palestinian cause. At the time, the second intifada (uprising) against the Israeli occupation was under way, with an escalating cycle of&#xa0;violence from both sides: frequent suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian militants, and incursions, shootings, shellings and demolitions by the Israeli military.</p> <p>\"It felt a little unnerving,\" says Cindy. \"At first we hoped it wouldn't happen. But Rachel was 23 years old, and was very much making her own decisions, as we thought she should. We had always supported our kids in whatever steps they wanted to take. Some people say: 'Why did you let her go?' That was not ever something I felt was my role.\"</p> <p>Cindy began learning about the Middle East: reading, watching films, discussing the issues with her daughter. Once Rachel had arrived in the Gaza Strip, her frequent emails home, describing what&#xa0;she was seeing and experiencing, illuminated what had been a distant conflict. \"They brought us a view, a perspective, that we had never seen before,\" says Cindy.</p> <p>The couple were anxious, but not unduly so. Rachel called soon after arriving in Rafah, asking her parents if they could hear the sound of shelling in the background. \"I could hear her voice trembling. Craig and I carried our anxiety with us.\" Cindy spoke to her daughter again, six days before her death. \"She sounded really happy.\"</p> <p>Then, on 16 March 2003, came that terrible phone call, \"the worst moment of my life\". Cindy \"stumbled through\" the following hours, days and weeks, feeling physically ill. \"I couldn't sleep. I&#xa0;would drift off, then feel jolts of pain through my arms. And then there was that thing of going to sleep and then waking up and finding that it is a nightmare but it's real and it's always there every day.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395262559\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/24/1345821893320/Rachel-Corrie-in-front-of-010.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Corrie in front of an Israeli army bulldozer at Rafah, 16 March 2003\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel in front of an Israeli army bulldozer at Rafah on 16 March 2003, the day she was killed.

I&#xa0;knew how important that was to her, and I knew what the impact had been on family and friends. She wanted to find ways for people to hear about what she was seeing.\"</p> <p>The family <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/mar/18/usa.israel\" title=\"\">released Rachel's emails</a> to the media. \"It was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/mar/18/israel1\" title=\"\">the Guardian that picked them up very quickly</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/mar/20/usa.israel\" title=\"\">it was huge, very significant</a>. All kinds of&#xa0;things came from that.\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/apr/08/theatre.israelandthepalestinians\" title=\"\">Rachel's powerful writing was adapted</a> into an acclaimed stage play, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/apr/14/theatre.politicaltheatre\" title=\"\">My Name is Rachel Corrie</a>, performed in at least 10&#xa0;countries, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/mar/15/theatre.israelandthepalestinians\" title=\"\">including Israel</a>. It was also published in book form, <a href=\"http://letmestandalone.com/\" title=\"\">Let Me Stand Alone</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the day after Rachel's death, then Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon promised then US president George W Bush a \"thorough, credible and transparent\" investigation into Rachel's death. Less than a month later, an internal inquiry by the Israeli military <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/apr/14/israel1\" title=\"\">concluded that its forces were not to blame</a>. The driver of the bulldozer had not seen Rachel before she was crushed beneath the vehicle, it said. No charges were brought and the case was closed.</p> <p>The Corries' battle for justice has dominated their lives for close to a decade. They found themselves \"up against a wall of Israeli officials determined to protect the state at all costs, including at the expense of truth\", as they said in a statement last summer.</p> <p>They learned how to campaign, deal&#xa0;with the media, assess legal documents, challenge authority and harness the support of their government whenever possible. Eventually \u2013 their \"absolutely last resort\" \u2013 in March 2010 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/23/corrie-death-law-case\" title=\"\">they sued the state of Israel over Rachel's death</a>, accusing its military of&#xa0;either unlawfully or intentionally killing her, or of gross negligence. \"The demands of the lawsuit have been huge,\" says Cindy. \"In some ways, we were naive, coming from the United States, where it's unusual for a trial not to be over within a few weeks.\"</p> <p>In the past two and a half years, the&#xa0;Corries have spent a total of eight months in Israel, broken into short visits to coincide with the sporadic hearings. Now, Cindy says, \"I'm just relieved to be at this point and, no matter what happens, we'll be at the other side.</p> <p>\"It's very unpredictable. We believe we know what should happen, but we also know what the state [of Israel] has to say. We'll have a verdict, and then we'll determine how to respond. But we know this won't be the end.\"</p> <p>Apart from justice for Rachel, the Corries are also committed to justice for the Palestinians. Six months after Rachel's death, Cindy and Craig finally visited Gaza, and the house their daughter was trying to protect from demolition. There have been subsequent visits to Gaza, and Cindy hopes there will be more in the future. The family have made many friends from Gaza, including the occupants of the house, the Nasrallah family, whose home was finally razed in the spring of 2004. Cindy says she now has a \"deeper sense of what injustice means\".</p> <p>\"Craig and I have been so blessed because Rachel gave us this opportunity to focus here. There's no end to the work that can be done around this issue, and other peace and justice issues. If, miraculously, the Israeli-Palestinian situation could be fixed, there'll be something else that could command and deserve attention.\"</p> <p>But, she adds: \"I know realistically I&#xa0;have to find a way to get more balance in my life than I have now. I look at the weeds in my yard and I think about how much I'd love to go out and work there for an hour every day. I hardly cook any more. I'd like to make some time for those kinds of things.\"</p> <p>The verdict in the lawsuit, she says, is part of a process, \"one piece of what we've done. In terms of what happened to Rachel and the accountability that we're seeking, the process has shown there are huge problems here [in Israel] in investigations and the legal system. There continue to be things that need to be discussed, exposed and addressed.\"</p> <p>\"Closure\" is not something Cindy is expecting. \"Closure isn't the right word. In my mind, it suggests that there's an end to something, and I just don't see that happening.</p> <p>\"The loss, the void, is permanent. You feel it every day of your life,\" she says slowly, hesitantly. \"What happened to Rachel will never be OK, but I feel pretty at peace with where I am. All you ever do is take the next breath and the next step. I'm still just taking the next step, but you get to the point where it's OK to do that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Walking on to a film set for the first time is always dislocating. You cross a boundary between a commonplace reality and a tight, compacted fictional space. It's a shock, like discovering a diamond in a lump of coal, or a woman on Mock the Week, or a Lib Dem canvasser on your doorstep.</p> <p>When the new series of The Thick of It was shot earlier this year, the wobbling stargate between ordinary space and the claustrophobic world of contemporary politics felt even more dramatic somehow. Production designer Simon Rogers and his team had conjured up the airless, gothic hellhole that is the opposition's headquarters within a blameless country house near Ruislip. You ascended a real, ancient staircase into a recreation of Labour's Victorian gloom-tank on Victoria Embankment. Suddenly that look of abandoned hope that seems to haunt Team Miliband made more sense. If a shadow cabinet meeting overruns they must all be on suicide watch. In the parallel telly universe it certainly doesn't improve the mood of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjAyazqtQj8\" title=\"\">Malcolm Tucker</a>.</p> <p>The show's coalition government ensemble inhabit a lighter, modern environment. But here the contrast between the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship set and its immediate environment was even more striking. The location was an amazing disused office slab in Walton-on Thames, half a century old, designed by architects Sir John Burnet, Tait and Partners in the \"Thunderbirds Modernism\" style. These days, a Ballardian wilderness hides the swinging 60s abstract sculpture and formal gardens, but the groovy aluminium facade still looks pristine. It's a lovely, long building, each floor a prairie of open space. The DoSAC set was hunched into a corner.</p> <p>On the \"real life\" side of the boundary, the space seemed fantastical, an optimistic dream world. There they'd have been, all those space-age ghosts. Doing the twist at the Christmas do, going on the pill, smoking pipes indoors, talking Tupperware, planning a holiday abroad. Everything was possible. Then you walked over the threshold of cables into the unreality of DoSAC. And you were plunged into this overcrowded rat cage, with fictional squabbling venal bastards at one another's throats in a grotesque travesty of consensus politics. And it felt as though this was the true space, this was the genuine reality. Here's Peter Mannion, the latest secretary of state, as beleaguered as the last. Mournfully, desperately looking for a corner to hide in, beset by civil servants, spads, his snarling coalition partners, the press. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZZYctmYfU\" title=\"\">And party strategist Stewart Pearson's fearsome shirts</a>.</p> <p>Uncomfortable space has been a tonal constant in Thick since 2005. As in real life, where we've watched successive administrations run out of money and credibility, so we've seen the characters in the show flail and suffocate in their analogue world of diminishing opportunity. Policy-making is reactive and panicky, expedient and reversible. Those notionally in power are choking under a brutal scrutiny.</p> <p>Small BBC budgets, of course, helped shape the spaces. Director Armando Iannucci and producer Adam Tandy have always improvised locations. The first series (now nailed historically by computer monitors the size of packing crates) was shot in a former brewery. A lot of bollocking and hiding takes places behind closed doors. We see hapless minister Hugh Abbott, played by the brilliant Chris Langham, eating biscuits in a pantry. Or tracked down by Tucker to his forlorn hiding place in a chair storeroom. At one point in the scene, Abbott even puts his head inside a cupboard.</p> <p>And series one established the classic Iannucci \"back seat of the car\" shot. Ministers and aides wedged in like terrified backbenchers under a three-line whip, desperately trying to pull soundbites out of thin air. It's a motif that continues into series four with an incredibly bad-tempered row between Mannion and his colleagues about how best to appear publicly concerned over something he didn't give a shit about half an hour earlier.</p> <p>In series two, largely shot in the BBC's own hideous media centre, DoSAC became part of a \"ministerial hub\". The characters were now spatially, literally in transparent government. Glass walls and clear sightlines through the communal open-plan office made it harder to hide from Tucker. Actually, the most farcical element of the building \u2013 a huge, overscaled staircase that has the effect of shrinking everyone on it to the size of a child \u2013 came into its own in series three. New minister Nicola Murray had to use the stairs because she had a fear of confined spaces and famously (\"See you, you're an omnishambles\") couldn't get in a lift. In the new series, Murray has a meltdown in an inter-city train vestibule. It's funny, but also almost unbearable to watch as the peerless Rebecca Front, who has publicly and bravely talked about claustrophobia, channels her own anxiety.</p> <p>In the past we've seen <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ioziwB9uQ\" title=\"\">Olly Reeder cornered by Tucker in a toilet,</a> John Duggan terrorised by Tucker in a bathroom, Glen Cullen assaulted by Tucker in a narrow hotel corridor. Nicola and Mannion and Richard Bacon in the radio studio, while the control booth teems with advisers. And this theme \u2013 lack of space, no room for manoeuvre \u2013 flows through the new series, perhaps most strikingly in the public inquiry scenes. Trapped in the witness chair, caught in the gaze of TV cameras, at the mercy of harsh inquisitors, our characters are in a familiar crisis.</p> <p>They've run out of time, and out of space.</p> <p><em>Ian Martin is a writer for The Thick of It.</em></p>",
  "<p>It may sometimes be tempting to dismiss the Conservatives in Britain as, at heart and in gut, a radical, government slashing, tax cutting, culturally reactionary party committed to dismantling everything about the welfare state and the social market. There are certainly some Tories who flirt, and more, with such ideas, though most of them don't have much influence in government. But in most of the party, sometimes uneasily, these impulses are held in check, especially at the top, by overwhelming political and economic realities.</p> <p>If, though, you want to see a party that really is all these things and proud of it, look across the ocean to the US Republicans, <a href=\"http://www.gopconvention2012.com/\" title=\"\">who meet in Tampa this week</a>, tropical storms permitting, to endorse Mitt Romney as their challenger to Barack Obama in November. If it's radical rightwing politics you want, then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/25/republican-convention-romney-radical-right?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the Republicans of the post-Tea Party era</a> embody them. Politically speaking, it's a different world.</p> <p>Going into their 2012 convention, the Republicans are a party in which there is no significant internal division over the claim that taxes must be slashed, that all government programmes other than defence must be cut, that the government economic stimulus should be undone, the federal pension system privatised, the federal healthcare insurance law abolished, that climate change is a hoax, that a high wall should be built along America's southern border, that abortion in all but the tiniest exceptions should be a crime, that gun control laws are a threat to freedom, that civil partnerships and gay marriage should be outlawed, that Iran's nuclear programme should be destroyed and more Jewish settlements encouraged in the occupied Palestinian territories. Oh, and a lot of them still think Mr Obama isn't really an American too, while Mr Romney is a member of a church that believes Jesus travelled to America.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/08/27/120827taco_talk_cassidy\" title=\"\">How far Mr Romney himself really believes many of these things</a> may still, on some level, be an unknown. One of the important questions of the week will be the precise positions he stakes out on these and other crucial questions when he accepts the nomination on Thursday. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21560864\" title=\"\">While he was governor of Massachusetts</a> \u2013 less than 10 years ago \u2013 he supported abortion, gun control, health insurance and tackling climate change. Now he opposes them. In the recent past, Mr Romney has tried to present himself as a successful practical businessman who can get the American economy moving. But the reality now is that he has embraced his party's radical right, especially by nominating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/15/paul-ryan-paradox-us-politics\" title=\"\">Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running-mate</a>.</p> <p>Barring any surprise disclaimers this week, this embrace shows just how wide the political ocean separating America from Europe now is. The gulf has long been obvious on issues such as climate change, gay equality, the death penalty and abortion. Now, though, it seems just as wide on economic policy too. Both Mr Romney and Mr Ryan, like all European politicians of the right, and many of the left too, claim to be in favour of cutting their government deficits. But it's only the Republicans who propose to slash every bit of government spending except for defence. And it's only the Republicans who not only refuse to even consider raising taxes (which are comparatively extremely low) to balance the budget, but who also want to cut those taxes further across the board. Mr Ryan wants a tax system with just two bands, 10% and 25%, and would abolish most of the meagre taxes on things like dividends, capital gains and inheritance <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/colbert-king-time-for-mitt-romney-to-come-clean-on-his-taxes/2012/08/24/0a2ddb4c-ee0b-11e1-b0eb-dac6b50187ad_story.html\" title=\"\">which are almost the only ones</a> that people like Mr Romney (who paid 13.9% of his multimillion-dollar income in taxes in 2010) actually pay.</p> <p>In the global financial crisis, all incumbents are unusually vulnerable. <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\" title=\"\">Mr Obama's poll lead is narrow, too</a>.

  "<p>The buses of New York perversely carry images of last year's losing finalists, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams, to promote the 2012 US Open, which starts on Monday.</p> <p>Nadal, injured, is not here but Williams, bouncing with fitness, brio and pedigree that mocks her No4 seeding, most definitely is.</p> <p>We were reminded of her considerable presence when she responded acidly to questions on Saturday about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqxo05tMVP4\" title=\"\">her supposedly controversial \"crip walk\"</a> to celebrate her Olympic triumph over Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon three weeks ago.</p> <p>At the time, Fox Sports fumed with all the cliches it could muster: \"She was in the city of kings and queens.

Whatever reservations or knowledge tennis writers may have about the history of a movement that began in ghetto solidarity in the 70s and has descended with sad predictability into a culture of crime and death on the streets of Compton, that is where Williams spent much of her youth. That is where she lost her older sister, Yetunde, in a drive-by shooting in 2003 because her boyfriend was a gang member.</p> <p>\"All people know that the crip walk is not just a dance,\" came the questioner's first serve at the final round of press conferences here.

If anything, you should be trying to ask me questions to lift me up not bring such things \u2026 I'm done with that question.\"</p> <p>Mess with Serena and keep your hands up. What was less convincing was her assertion that: \"I haven't even seen the draw.\"</p> <p>She will know by now, no doubt, that she is due to play her 22-year-old fellow American Coco Vandeweghe on Tuesday, and thereafter hurtles towards more testing engagements against, probably, Maria Kirilenko, seeded 14th, and the former world No1 Caroline Wozniacki on the way to a semi-final against the No2 seed Agnieszka Radwanska, whom she beat to win her fifth Wimbledon title seven weeks ago.</p> <p>Yet, for all her achievements, for all that she has beaten life-threatening illness and shows no sign of going away, the media glare has fallen more kindly here on Kim Clijsters, who was greeted with predictable and deserved gush on the occasion of her farewell grand-slam tournament.</p> <p>Just about every other player was asked to say how wonderful was the ever-smiling Belgian mother who was runner-up here when world No1 in 2003 and won the second of her three US Open titles as a wild card when she came out of retirement three years ago.</p> <p>\"Obviously this place is magical for me,\" Clijsters said. \"I have had so many beautiful memories. I have always enjoyed being around the other players and having a good relationship with them. There are a lot of girls I have stayed in touch with over the years, even when I retired in the past and had Jada and got married.\"</p> <p>She said of Serena: \"It's great to see that she's doing so well physically after all the problems that she's had.\" And she meant it. Good stories do not come more Hollywood perfect.</p> <p>Among active players, no one has won more than her 31 titles on hard courts \u2013 and Williams has 30, with eight of them in slams (to Clijsters's four).</p> <p>Clijsters's final bow may come a little earlier than her fans want but probably no earlier than realists expect. Williams, though, cares little about pleasing a gallery that has only occasionally given her the sort of unconditional love afforded her rival. Her New York nadir arrived three years ago when she was booed off court on her way out of the tournament after berating an official over a foot-fault in her semi-final against Clijsters.</p> <p>But history is there for the making again. Only seven players aged 30 or over have won a slam title in the open era \u2013 Margaret Court (three), Martina Navratilova (three), Chris Evert (two), Billie Jean King (two), Ann Jones, Virginia Wade and Williams, who did it at Wimbledon this year.</p> <p>It is Serena's time.

  "<p>When, in July 1969, Neil Armstrong, who has died aged 82, made his celebrated \"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\" by becoming the first human being to walk on the moon, he was indeed the \"reluctant hero\" of his family's apt description.</p> <p>As the commander of the US Apollo 11 spacecraft, in which he was accompanied by Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin, the pilot of the Eagle lunar landing module and Michael Collins, pilot of the Columbia command module, he became the first man on the moon because he had arrived at the head of the queue of around 20 highly experienced and motivated astronauts. They had been taking it in turns to conduct the 22 manned spaceflights needed to learn the techniques for travelling to the Earth's nearest neighbour \u2013 an objective he pursued with great seriousness.</p> <p>Space correspondents like myself, attending every mission, soon found that Armstrong was unique among his colleagues. A member of the second group to be selected, he was unlike all the others, self-conscious and deeply introverted. He did not enjoy talking to us unless we were fully informed; the trivial questions posed by general reporters he found unbearable, and he remained a quietly dignified figure for the rest of his life, working principally as an engineering academic and businessman.</p> <p>Born in Wapakoneta, Ohio, Armstrong had acquired his student pilot's licence by the age of 16. In 1947, he went to Purdue University on a navy scholarship to study aeronautical engineering, but two years later the Korean war intervened, and he flew 78 combat missions. Eventually he completed his BSc at Purdue and an MSc in aerospace engineering at the University of Southern California.</p> <p>In 1955 he went to Cleveland, Ohio, as a civilian research pilot at the Lewis Research Centre of what became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), and later that year to <a href=\"http://www.edwards.af.mil/\" title=\"\">Edwards Air Force Base</a> in California. As a pioneer of many high-speed aircraft, involved in both piloting and engineering, he flew over 200 different models, including jets, rockets, helicopters and gliders.</p> <p>When Nasa embarked on its second astronaut training programme in 1962, he was one of the nine test pilots chosen. Four years later, on Gemini 8 for his first space venture, Armstrong brought his experience into play when the spacecraft continued spinning after completing a docking manoeuvre. The situation could have become life-threatening and the mission was abandoned after only a day in orbit.</p> <p>President John F Kennedy's end-of-the-decade target for a manned moon landing was a constant target for Nasa, and early in 1969 I learned from George Low, its head of manned spaceflight, that the Apollo 11 crew would be attempting the first such expedition.</p> <p>While Armstrong would be in command, Aldrin would be the first to step on the moon; Armstrong would follow the naval tradition of being the last to leave the ship. So it came as a shock when I got the flight plan and press kit a few weeks ahead of the launch, showing that Armstrong would be first out.</p> <p>There was much resentment about the change, publicly expressed by Aldrin's father, a senior military man. Buzz fretted and raised it internally, but Armstrong steadfastly refused to discuss it. Nasa said the change was merely because it was physically easier for Armstrong to exit the lunar lander first.</p> <p>Later I learned that Low and other top Nasa officials had suddenly realised that the first man on the moon would become immortal in the public's eyes. The grave Armstrong, they realised, was much more suited to the role than Aldrin, a brilliant and outspoken mathematician, always liable to challenge and disagree with authority.</p> <p>Apollo 11 took off on 16 July, and four days later the Eagle descended on to a plain near the south-western edge of the Sea of Tranquillity. Around six and a half hours later, Armstrong stepped off the ladder of the lunar module, the first human being to set foot on the moon. After 20 minutes Aldrin joined him to address hundreds of millions of television viewers all over the world, watching in black and white, and collect rocks.</p> <p>An interesting consequence is that we do not have a single clear photograph of Armstrong on the lunar surface [see footnote]. Aldrin was scheduled in the flight plan \u2013 which covered every second of their nearly three hours there \u2013 to take the historic picture of the first man on the moon standing beside the lunar module and its plaque reading: \"We came in peace for all mankind.\" When the time came, Armstrong duly took up his position, and held out the camera for Aldrin to take it. Aldrin, busy collecting lunar samples and setting out scientific equipment on the surface, replied: \"No, you keep it,\" and carried on. Nothing intentional, he said later, just the way it happened.</p> <p>So the surface pictures we do have are all of Aldrin taken by Amstrong, the most famous of them being the one in which Armstrong is reflected in Aldrin's facepiece. Armstrong, following military tradition, never complained, never explained.</p> <p>The ceremonial aspect continued with the raising of the American flag and a radiotelephone conversation with President Richard Nixon. Experiments were completed, and soil and rocks gathered. After more than 21 hours on the lunar surface, the Eagle took off to rejoin the Columbia command module, in which Collins had been orbiting the moon. Splashdown in the Pacific on 24 July was followed by decontamination procedures, and the geological samples and film were flown to Nasa mission control in Houston, Texas.</p> <p>The three astronauts were naturally in demand for tours around the world, and once that excitement had died down, Armstrong became deputy associate administrator for aeronautics at the Nasa headquarters office of advanced research and technology in Washington until 1971, when he resigned, put off by the prospect of continuing in the organisation with a desk job. He was professor of aeronautical engineering at the University of Cincinnati for the next eight years, and for two decades after that acted as director of a variety of corporations.</p> <p>He served on the National Commission on Space, a presidential body examining the prospects for taking the space programme further, in 1985-86, and in 1986 was also vice-chairman of the committee investigating the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. During the early 1990s he presented an aviation documentary series for television entitled First Flights.</p> <p>Though conscious that he had enjoyed a figurehead role for a project that had involved thousands of people, Armstrong was always gracious about celebrating achievements in space to date. In February this year he spoke at an event at Ohio State University to mark the 50th anniversary of the orbiting of the Earth by the first American to do so, John Glenn.</p> <p>A couple of hours after that first landing in July 1969, I talked to Wernher von Braun, whose Saturn V rockets had made it all possible. He gave me a copy of his longterm plan. It showed the first humans landing on Mars in the 1980s. He died in 1977, so never knew that his target would be missed by around 100 years. Armstrong retained his interest in space exploration policy, and in 2010 went on camera to express his disappointment at the cancellation of plans to send astronauts back to the moon. He later went on to doubt that depending on commercial companies would revive the space effort.</p> <p>Armstrong is survived by his second wife, Carol, and by two sons from his first marriage, which ended in divorce.</p> <p>\u2022 Neil Alden Armstrong, astronaut, born 5 August 1930; died 25 August 2012</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was appended on 28 August 2012.

  "<p>For more than 20 years, the proportions of young people achieving higher grades in GCSE and A-levels drifted steadily upwards. Arguments raged over whether increased success rates were attributable to easier exams and softer marking or to better teaching and more spending on education. Whatever the truth, no education secretary or examinations regulator made the smallest attempt to arrest or reverse the trend. Parents, teachers and pupils were happy. Only rumbles of dissent from employers and universities disturbed the mood of mutual congratulation.</p> <p>Then the education secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/22/english-gcses-marked-down-teachers\" title=\"\">Michael Gove, took a stand</a>.

Though it denies collusion, Ofqual, the regulator, ordered the exam boards to ensure that the performance levels required for each grade were consistent year on year. This year, the overall proportions getting GCSE grades A*-C fell 0.4%, and in English \u2013 a vital subject for future progression \u2013 by 1.5%. About 10,000 teenagers who were expecting a C grade in English got a D instead. Predictable outrage \u2013 and threats of legal action \u2013 followed, just as it did in 2002 when, after changes in A-level exams, some pupils, many from fee-charging schools, got B grades or lower when they anticipated As. The 2002 row hastened the departures of the then education secretary (Estelle Morris) and the chairman of Ofqual's predecessor. Ministers may sometimes wish to pose as guardians of standards but they associate themselves with higher failure rates at their political peril. Better by far to let success rates rise and claim the credit.</p> <p>Gove should understand that exams are rationing devices. Success rates depend not on objective measures of performance but on the availability of the rationed goods: university places and positions in elite professional occupations. Fifty years ago, when barely 6% went to university, fewer than half the entrants to A-level were awarded passes. Now, with higher education available to 36%, the pass rate from a far larger pool of candidates is close to 100%, and more than 25% get A grades. Even universities, which complain that A-level students lack the skills and knowledge of their predecessors, hand out firsts and upper seconds to more than 60% of their students against barely half in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>A Britain stricken by economic stagnation may not be able to support a university system at its current size. Nor, despite the talk of skills shortages, may it be able to sustain its number of high-quality jobs. That is why ministers wish to curb grade inflation. Just as greater success rates raise expectations, so lower rates depress them. If young people fail their exams, they may then blame their own inadequacies for lack of opportunity, not politicians' misguided economic policies.</p> <p>But general educational qualifications, which serve as currency in job markets, have a natural tendency to inflation, just as monetary currency does. Politicians fret over both, but it is usually a losing battle.</p> <p>When inflation rises 5%, workers are no better off with a 5% wage rise. Similarly, young people find that A-levels and degrees \u2013 their value debased because they are plentifully available \u2013 are no longer passports to the same careers as they were, say, 50 years ago. Nor are the higher grades of GCSE as valuable as the old O-level grades to which they are supposedly equivalent. Professions such as law and accountancy, once available to entrants with a single A-level, are now closed to anybody who lacks a degree. Journalism, where even editors frequently held nothing more than a couple of O-levels, has become an almost entirely graduate occupation. Increasingly, employers will accept nothing less than an upper second, and even require postgraduate certificates.</p> <p>Some qualifications entail knowledge and skills of direct relevance to the jobs that demand them. Most don't. Their content is irrelevant. Their holders may (or may not) be more cultivated, reflective and wise after long periods of study. But there is scant evidence that they make better lawyers, accountants, bankers, managers and journalists.</p> <p>The main effect of increasing access to A-levels and degrees is not, as originally intended, to ensure that elite&#xa0;jobs are open to talent from all backgrounds. On the contrary, longer periods of education and extended hurdles of certification favour the offspring of advantaged families, with their greater financial resources, greater reserves of cultural capital and greater access to elite institutions. By paying private school fees (or higher prices for houses close to favoured state schools) and supporting postgraduate study, today's middle classes buy prestigious jobs for their children just as elite families once bought army commissions and civil service positions.</p> <p>Forty years ago, when the left still had&#xa0;vigour and ambition and the deleterious effects of the qualification spiral were already evident, bold reforms were widely debated.</p> <p>First, it was suggested, employers and professional bodies should be prohibited from setting entry barriers in terms of general educational qualifications, such as five higher grade GCSEs or upper second-class degrees. Discrimination against the uncertificated, it was argued, is as unjust as discrimination against black or disabled people. Job candidates should be selected on specific competencies, skills and knowledge. Second, schools and universities, instead of acting as gatekeepers issuing passports for elite positions, should introduce \"achievement reports\" detailing what young people know, what skills they have acquired, their personal qualities, and so on. Grades or marks should be issued for specific parts of the syllabus, not for overall performance.</p> <p>The arguments for such changes, restoring educational goals to primacy in schools and universities, are stronger than ever. But Gove moves in the opposite direction: making exams more traditional and ending a recent trend towards splitting them into discrete \"modules\" that could form the basis of achievement reports. He prefers fighting a losing battle against grade inflation to asking if grades are needed at all and creating a system fairer to young people and more valuable for employers.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>European Central Bank plans to increase lending to struggling eurozone members risks becoming \"addictive like a drug\", Germany's central bank chief warned on Sunday.</p> <p>Jens Weidmann said printing billions of euros and offering them at low interest rates would make life too easy for indebted countries and deter them from making cuts in public expenditure and pushing through economic reforms.</p> <p>\"Such a policy is for me close to state financing via the printing press,\" Weidmann told Der Spiegel magazine. \"We should not underestimate the risk that central bank financing can become addictive like a drug.\"</p> <p>The hard hitting message came as other European nations appeared to soften their stance on Greece and other vulnerable single currency members rescued by ECB loans.</p> <p>Austrian chancellor Werner Faymann said Greece should get more time to repay its debts, in a clear break with Germany, which has so far opposed any delay.</p> <p>Spain is only days away from announcing the details of its \u20ac100bn (\u00a379bn) bank bailout which uses cheap funds from Brussels to underwrite its struggling banking sector. But there are fears Madrid remains vulnerable to collapse and will need further support from eurozone institutions.</p> <p>The ECB is discussing proposals to offer cheap loans when interest rates on government bonds soar towards a pre-determined ceiling.</p> <p>Deep divisions among the eurozone's 17 nations are coming to the fore in response to special pleading by Greece for a relaxation in the terms of its bailout.</p> <p>Antonis Samaras, the Greek prime minister, is touring the continent in search of support from eurozone members for a two year extension on loan repayments under the terms of its second \u20ac130bn bailout package.</p> <p>Athens is concerned that without an extension political unrest will increase and any hopes of reform will disappear.</p> <p>Germany and France said after meetings with Samaras that Greece's leaders must show their commitment to reform before winning concessions.</p> <p>Austria and others in the eurozone's \"core\" of stronger economies have often provided advance warning throughout three years of crisis of the line the bloc's leaders will finally take.</p> <p>\"I see quite a good chance that we will arrive at an outcome with Greece that the Greeks stick to their agreements with the EU but in return get more time for the repayment,\" Faymann told newspaper Oesterreich.</p> <p>\"The most important thing is that the Greeks stick to the reforms and savings targets agreed with us. If that is guaranteed, I am in favour of a delay in the repayment,\" he said, adding that the delay could be two or three years.</p> <p>The ECB's plans have become a focus of dispute, with officials from countries such as Spain and Italy pushing for the central bank's boss Mario Draghi, to sanction widespread intervention in secondary bond markets.</p> <p>ECB officials from northern eurozone countries, including the Netherlands and Finland, only want the central bank to intervene in short bursts when bond yields explode upwards.</p> <p>The ECB is controlled by a board of six nominated officials and a broader committee of representatives from member states.</p> <p>Germany's Finance Ministry is concerned the new ECB plan could endanger the bank's independence, Der Spiegel said.</p> <p>As a condition for ECB support, a country will first have to seek an aid programme from the eurozone's bailout funds. This is subject to approval by finance ministers, and central bankers are worried this makes their action dependent on politicians.</p> <p>To avert this risk, German finance ministry officials were exploring an option where Spain or Italy would make a commitment on economic reforms to the European Commission \u2013 an unelected body \u2013 as a condition for ECB support, rather than accepting an aid programme from the bailout funds, Der Spiegel said.</p> <p>Weidmann, who reflects the broad antagonism inside Angela Merkel's right wing coalition against further bailouts, said: \"In democracies, it is parliaments and not central banks that should decide on such a comprehensive pooling of risks.\"</p> <p>He did not see an immediate inflation threat from the new bond-buying programme, but added: \"If monetary policy allows itself to become a comprehensive political problem solver, its real goal risks moving further and further into the background.\"</p> <p>Weidmann warned against tieing the ECB \"to guarantee keeping member states in the eurozone at any price.\"</p> <p>On Greece's position in the bloc, he said it was important that \"no further damage to trust in the framework of the currency union arises, and that the economic policy requirements of the aid programme retain their credibility.\"</p>",
  "<p>Almost 20 years ago, when I&#xa0;was a young(ish) reporter on A Certain Tabloid Newspaper, I received one of the more curious of the many briefings I have heard during my career in journalism.</p> <p>Taking me to one side in the newsroom and casting a glance over his shoulder, the news editor told me, <em>sotto voce</em>: \"Ian, get yourself to northern Cyprus. When you get there, don't do anything. Don't talk to anybody. Do nothing. Zilch. I'll try to get you back by the weekend.\"</p> <p>It was Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Clearly this escapade had something to do with Asil Nadir, the tycoon who had a short time before fled to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus in order to escape <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/22/polly-peck-asil-nadir-analysis\" title=\"\">multimillion-pound theft charges following the collapse of his FTSE 100 conglomerate, Polly Peck</a>. But what was it all about, exactly?</p> <p>\"Sorry mate,\" said the news editor. \"I can't tell you.\"</p> <p>I thought this was ludicrous, and eventually the news editor agreed to enlighten me a little. The chairman of the newspaper, he said, had told the editor that he had discovered that Asil&#xa0;was doing some sort of deal with the British government, one that would allow him to return to the UK. And the chairman was rather proud of this exclusive tip.</p> <p>The only problem was that he was completely wrong. The crime reporter at The Certain Tabloid had called the Serious Fraud Office, who assured him there was no such deal. The home affairs correspondent had telephoned the home secretary, Michael Howard, who told him it was balderdash. \"But the chairman keeps demanding to know who we've got in northern Cyprus, checking out his tip. The editor's told him you're already there. So you'd better get cracking!\"</p> <p>In those days, travelling to the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\", a self-declared state that was recognised by few other governments, and hence had no extradition treaties, involved flying first to Turkey, where there was some jiggery-pokery before the aircraft could take off again. Turkish border guards would come on to the aircraft and check the passports of all the passengers; the pilot would then announce that the aircraft was now controlled by a different company, and had a different flight number, and off we would fly to Kyrenia on the island's north coast.</p> <p>Arriving late that evening I checked into a hotel and, unable to resist the temptation to ignore my instructions, immediately rang an acquaintance who worked for Nadir. I wanted to check the lie of the land. There must be some sort of story here?</p> <p>My acquaintance suggested that I&#xa0;might move next day to the Jasmine Court, a luxury beachside hotel owned by Nadir, which would be much more comfortable. On arrival, the hotel appeared deserted but for a small army of smiling staff, who seemed to know all about me and about my mission. I&#xa0;was provided with a poolside suite at a ridiculously low price. I then drove to Nadir's home a few miles down the coast at Lapta.</p> <p>The entrance to this luxurious bolthole was guarded by a couple of young men sitting inside a gatehouse that resembled nothing so much as a small gun emplacement, with a narrow slit instead of a window. They convinced me that the boss wasn't at home, so I set off to find him in Lefkosa, as the northern section of divided Nicosia is known.</p> <p>Nadir's suite of offices were on the second floor of a small block, and could be accessed only by a very small lift. His secretary made clear that he was too busy to see me, so I asked if I could wait for him on a sofa just outside the door to his office. And there I sat, for hour after hour. It was all very cordial, with the secretary bringing me cups of sweet coffee and glasses of water. But it was clear that Nadir wasn't coming out. And I wasn't going in. I returned to the Jasmine Court, where I was told by a smiling receptionist that my suite was no longer available, and I would have to move to another hotel.</p> <p>Over the next few days, with a bit of effort, the picture became a little clearer, and a lot more extraordinary.</p> <p>The collapse of Nadir's empire had been one of the biggest in British corporate history, and one of the City of London's blue-chip accountancy firms had been appointed as administrators. But while the administrators controlled Polly Peck's assets on paper and in law, in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus and Turkey those properties and businesses remained firmly in the hands of the tycoon's placemen. They couldn't be seized, and they certainly couldn't be sold to pay off any&#xa0;creditors.</p> <p>The situtation was getting a little fraught: one of the administrators had been shot in the leg in Istanbul, another had been beaten about the head and somebody had firebombed a car owned by a Turkish Cypriot lawyer working for the City firm. There had also, apparently, been some unspeakable nonsense involving headless chickens and dead cats.</p> <p>British accountants had taken to arriving in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus in the company of ex-special forces bodyguards. On one occasion a small accountant and two large bodyguards had crammed themselves into the lift to Nadir's office. When it became stuck between floors, nobody had shown any great interest in letting them out.</p> <p>Eventually, I learned, the administrators had in desperation decided to open secret negotiations with a view to selling Polly Peck's local assets to \u2026 Asil Nadir.</p> <p>I had a story.</p> <p>I dashed back to my rather ropy hotel, rang The Certain Tabloid Newspaper, and told the news editor that the chairman appeared to have been on to something: he'd just got all the facts wrong. I, on the other hand, had it all: the secret four-hour talks between the blue-chip accountants and the infamous fugitive; the shooting, the dead cats. I even had a brace of sweating ex-SAS men in a jammed Lefkosa lift. Fabulous.</p> <p>\"File it straight away!\" cried the news editor.</p> <p>I did, and ran headlong into the Contempt of Court Act.</p> <p>Two days earlier, the trial of the boyfriend of a soap star, who was facing assault charges, had been halted because of the way in which several newspapers had reported the matter. The trial judge, clearly furious, had asked the attorney general to consider prosecuting the newspapers for contempt of court. The lawyer at The Certain Tabloid Newspaper was concerned that my story \u2013 if published before Asil Nadir was led into the dock at the Old Bailey \u2013 could similarly wreck his trial, and result in the newspaper being prosecuted for contempt.</p> <p>\"Oh come on,\" I argued, \"he's sitting pretty here, it's going to be years before he faces trial.\"</p> <p>I was referring to what attorneys general call the \"fade factor\", the notion that that the longer the gap between publication of an article and the trial of a defendant, the less substantial is likely to be the risk of serious prejudice to their chances of receiving a fair trial. By the time Nadir stepped into the dock, nobody was going to remember my story, no matter how pleased I was with it.</p> <p>But I lost the argument, the blue pencil came out, and my story was turned into a business report, a dry and anaemic shadow of itself, with no firebombs, no bodyguards, and not a headless chicken in sight.</p> <p>Last week, after returning to Britain to stand trial almost two decades later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/23/asil-nadir-10-years-jail-polly-peck\" title=\"\">Nadir was convicted of stealing \u00a330m from Polly Peck and sentenced to 10&#xa0;years in jail</a>. He had been driven, the judge said, by pure greed.</p> <p>Like me, the lawyer who wrecked my story all those years ago is now working for the Guardian. I sauntered over to his desk, thinking we could perhaps have a chat about the fade factor. Or perhaps I still wanted to berate him.</p> <p>But it had all been so long ago that the fade factor had worked its magic. Cats? Shootings? Jammed lifts? He couldn't remember what on earth I was talking about. But at least now I can tell the tale.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 August 2012. The original referred to Northern Cyprus throughout, rather than Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, in contravention of the Style guide. This has been corrected.</p>",

If you are law abiding and peaceful than you should be able to address your government,\" said camp organiser Cheri Honkala, an anti-poverty campaigner and the Green Party's nominee for vice-president in the 2012 election.</p> <p>Honkala is also the co-founder of the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign, which is the main driving force behind the encampment which was begun in May.</p> <p>The group rented the lot, situated just outside an army-navy general store beside the main freeway exit into downtown Tampa, making it a certain sight to the thousands of Republicans and media pouring into the city each day.</p> <p>Among those on view will be Elijah Seabrookes, 56, who arrived in Florida in recent weeks after failing to find work in his native New York.</p> <p>He is now living out of a tent on the lot alongside Occupy movement protesters, Green Party members and the homeless and down-on-their-luck.</p> <p>\"I came here because I wanted to find a home and a job. But I found that there was neither. So now I am living in a tent here,\" said the former security guard.</p> <p>Organisers say the name \"Romneyville\" is meant to play on the \"Hooverville\" settlements that sprung up during the Great Depression.</p> <p>\"We want to show that the 'P Word' is not a curse word. With that word being 'poverty',\" said Bruce Wright, one of the campaign's organisers.</p> <p>The group also plans to protest at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, but the Republican gathering in Tampa is all that is on their minds now. \"It is a right-wing extremist party and we want to show people that,\" Wright added.</p>",
  "<p>The organisers of the Paralympic Games have come under fire for imposing an \"unfair\" ticketing system on wheelchair users that forces them to make calls costing up to 41p a minute to see if they can reserve a space at venues.</p> <p>In a system branded discriminatory by some critics, <a href=\"http://www.tickets.london2012.com/infofordisabled.html\" title=\"\">Locog tells people</a> trying to book wheelchair tickets that they must call an 0844 number \u2013 which, according to Ofcom, costs between 1p and 13p a minute from a landline and 15p-41p from a mobile phone. Able-bodied fans can buy tickets online without any extra costs.</p> <p>The discrepancy has provoked outrage among disabled people, who have set up a <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/501984029827235/\" title=\"\">780-member Facebook campaign group</a> called \"Stop the Olympics from discriminating against wheelchair users!\" to vent their fury.</p> <p>Gerry Sutcliffe, a former Labour sports minister who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on disability sports, said he had raised the \"unfair\" system with Locog.</p> <p>\"The organising committee have done a fantastic job but there is discrimination against those people who are wheelchair users, who are going to have to use this premium rate,\" he added.</p> <p>\"We are not talking about vast amounts of money here against the context of the Games but it is the principle of the thing. For this small group of people who have had to pay the premium rate, we should find a way of compensating them.\"</p> <p>Speaking at St Paul's Cathedral before a service to mark the opening of the Games, Paralympian Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson defended the Locog policy, saying the phone line was there to provide customers with a special service and that the intentions behind it \"were good\". But, of the call charges facing wheelchair users, she added: \"Basically the figures I've heard are between 5p and 35p a minute. Obviously 5p is kind of OK; 35p is not.\"</p> <p>Asked about the charges, Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, said he agreed there was an issue, but insisted it was minor. \"I think you have to look at the thing as a whole and say, 'Are we doing enough? Are we doing more than we have ever done for people who are disabled so they can enjoy the spectacle?' And we are, we are doing a huge amount,\" he told the BBC.</p> <p>\"What we're doing is more than has been done before. You are picking on one thing we're not doing, but actually, overall, we have done more in this Paralympics organisation for disabled people because we want them to feel part of it.\"</p> <p>In a statement, Locog said the phone line was a bespoke service to \"ensure customers could discuss their individual accessibility needs\" at the Games. It had introduced the phone line in May, it added, after offering wheelchair spaces online since September last year, so that it could sell to specific seats rather than to a price category. Locog said it was not making any money from the line.</p> <p>\"We are proud to do more for spectators with accessibility needs than any other sporting event in this country,\" Locog's statement said. \"We offer free Games mobility scooters at Games venues, free blue badge parking and a free companion seat for every wheelchair space. We exceeded UK legislation and sports ground guidance for providing more accessible seating and wheelchair positions than any other sports stadium in the country.\"</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Finding a flat used to be so simple. Tenants viewed a few places, selected their dream home, paid money upfront, signed the agreement and behold \u2013 the place was theirs. These days it's much more complicated. Potential renters submit to rigorous vetting after completing reams of baffling forms.</p> <p>Potential tenants must be perfect, and by perfect I mean possessing a pristine credit history without so much as one little red utility bill. They need references from previous landlords and current employers, guarantors (and tenants must pay over the odds for guarantors to be credit checked). Soon, guarantors will need guarantors, and so on ad infinitum.</p> <p>This week's<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/23/ministers-house-building\" title=\"\"> Montague report</a> recommended building lots of lovely new homes, ultimately intended for individual private landlords and large companies to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/renting?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">rent out</a>. Little mention was made of rent levels or security, but even less was said about who will jump the growing amount of hurdles required to live in rented homes.</p> <p>Would-be tenants wade through a long and winding list of invasive questions. To start the tenancy process, they pay a holding fee and nervously submit to a list of checks: if they fail, they lose their money (along with the property). They must accept an annual rent rise, even when property values and interest rates are falling. It's like signing a pre-nup: a friend showed me a well-known letting agent's \"pre-rent\" document. When asked for a \u00a3150 holding fee, she refused due to an annual obligatory rent rise of at least 3.5%.</p> <p>Supplicants must have a job. Actually, make that the right sort of job \u2013 none of this part-time work shenanigans: no part-time study, short-term contracts, portfolio career, unpaid internships or temping. Unfortunately, this is how we work now, and tenant checks are ignoring this fact.</p> <p>Jump all these hurdles, and the computer might still say no. Letting agents increasingly outsource their complex, bureaucratic tenant approval checks to specialist firms. They in turn use computer protocols assessing income and outgoings to decree whether applicants can afford the rent. Tenants might find the only way to secure a place is by offering six months' rent upfront.</p> <p>A friend nearly lost a tenancy when one of those legendary computerised \"affordability assessments\" erroneously rejected her. The whole process of vetting was outsourced, as was the inventory check. Fortunately the agent was so infuriated with the computer programme that they abandoned the process and let the flat using old-fashioned evidence like wage slips and bank statements.</p> <p>Buy-to-let is a business that involves risk. There is no guarantee of profit, and landlords house human beings, not robots. Some checks for prospective renters are reasonable, like requesting photo ID to eliminate fraudsters \u2013 although how many agents retain such information in contravention of data protection legislation?</p> <p>Anyone watching BBC1's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zdf6q\" title=\"\">Neighbourhood Watched</a>, or Scotland's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sjs1t\" title=\"\">The Scheme</a> will have learned that providing rented housing requires a level of compassion, forgiveness and humour alien to most corporations and investment banks.</p> <p>People are flawed and life is complicated. When wages are low and when jobs are scarce and insecure, providers need tact, understanding and, yes, actual kindness. And a computer can never say yes to common sense.</p>",
  "<p>The Scottish government has been urged to stand firm over its plans to legalise same-sex marriage and not be derailed by an \"anti-gay agenda\", as the Catholic church in Scotland launched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/26/scottish-catholics-campaign-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">a campaign to maintain \"the universally accepted definition of marriage\" as a union between a man and a woman</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.scmo.org/articles/cardinal-obrien-calls-on-politicians-to--sustain-rather-than-subvert-marriage.html\" title=\"\">In a letter</a> read out in all 500 of the church's parishes, Scotland's Catholic bishops expressed their \"deep disappointment\" that Alex Salmond's administration has vowed to pass legislation that could see the first gay marriage ceremonies by 2015. The letter called on worshippers to pray for their political leaders so that they may preserve the traditional nature of marriage \"for the good of Scotland and of our society\".</p> <p>Cardinal Keith O'Brien, the leader of the country's Catholic church, who last weekend <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19305232\" title=\"\">broke off direct talks</a> with the Scottish government on gay marriage, said: \"The church's teaching on marriage is unequivocal, it is uniquely the union of a man and a woman and it is wrong that governments, politicians or parliaments should seek to alter or destroy that reality.\" He added: \"While we pray that our elected leaders will sustain rather than subvert marriage, we promise to continue to do everything we can to convince them that redefining marriage would be wrong for society.\"</p> <p>Gay rights activists condemned the move. \"It is increasingly clear that the church has an anti-gay agenda that it wants to impose on the rest of society,\" said Tom French, policy co-ordinator of the Equality Network. \"We urge the Scottish government to stand firm on plans to introduce equal marriage and not give in to demands that would discriminate against LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] people.\"</p> <p>Particularly worrying, said French, was any suggestion that the Catholic church would take the fight into schools. According to the bishops' letter, a National Commission for Marriage and the Family will be launched, which would be especially important for young people and children. O'Brien said the body would \"develop an online presence and produce materials and organise events\" to promote the cause.</p> <p>French said the Equality Network would be \"deeply concerned\" by any attempt to take these activities into schools. \"School should be a welcoming environment for all young people, regardless of their sexual orientation or their family situation,\" he said.</p> <p>In the face of intense pressure from not only the Catholic church but also Muslim&#xa0;organisations and evangelical and presbyterian churches, the Scottish government has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/25/scotland-legalise-same-sex-marriage\" title=\"\">continued with its plan</a> to legalise gay marriage. A draft bill is to be published later this year.</p> <p>Opinion polls have shown that about two-thirds of Scots are in favour of the changes.</p> <p>The government has insisted that no clergy would be forced to carry out same-sex weddings and has included new protections and \"conscience clauses\" for churches and individual clergy in the legislation. This has not, however, succeeded in placating opponents, foremost among them O'Brien, who in March drew criticism when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17249099\" title=\"\">describing gay marriage</a> as a \"grotesque subversion of a universally accepted human right\".</p> <p>In the letter to followers on what was declared \"national marriage Sunday\", the bishops said: \"We write to you having already expressed our deep disappointment that the Scottish government has decided to redefine marriage and legislate for same-sex marriage. We take this opportunity to thank you for your past support in defence of marriage and hope you will continue to act against efforts to redefine it. We reaffirm before you all the common wisdom of humanity and the revealed faith of the church that marriage is a unique lifelong union of a man and a woman.\"</p> <p>It added: \"The bishops of Scotland will continue to promote and uphold the universally accepted definition of marriage as the union solely of a man and a woman.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch has defended the decision of the Sun to publish pictures of a naked Prince Harry in Las Vegas, saying it was necessary to make a point about the lack of \"free press\" in Britain.</p> <p>His comments were made on Twitter, as the row over the pictures, published on Friday, continued to escalate with an intervention from the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who said the Sun was wrong to publish.</p> <p>Murdoch, however, believes the British blackout was a mistake in light of widespread availability of the images on the internet and in international newspapers and told his Twitter followers the paper had to take a stance.</p> <p>Showing no signs of retreating from a dust-up with regulators in Britain, the media mogul tweeted : \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/239461046392328192\" title=\"\">Needed to demonstrate no such thing as free press in the UK. Internet makes mockery of these issues. 1st amendment please.</a>\"</p> <p>But he later urged people to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/239556115178856448\" title=\"\">give Prince Harry \"a break\"</a> over his antics in Las Vegas. \"Prince Harry. Give him a break. He may be on the public payroll one way or another, but the public loves him, even to enjoy Las Vegas.\"</p> <p>Murdoch made his stance public after more than 850 complaints were made to the Press Complaints Commission on Friday about an alleged invasion of privacy.</p> <p>Publication of the images will be seen as a bid to re-establish the Sun's brand as a brash paper which will dare to take on the establishment despite the threat of statutory regulation from the Leveson inquiry into press ethics.</p> <p>The Sun's decision to publish was widely seen as a defiant act, coming just 48 hours after Prince Charles's personal solicitors, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, issued a letter to newspapers warning them there was no justification for publication in English law.</p> <p>Initially the paper had complied with Prince Charles's wishes and on Thursday it got its features picture editor and an intern to strip off and pose in a mocked-up photo of the prince and the unknown woman with him in the Las Vegas hotel room.</p> <p>On Friday it did an about-turn, claiming the fact that the pictures were widely available on the internet made a mockery of British papers.It claimed the Palace was trying to \"muzzle\" the British press and there was a \"clear public interest\" in publishing the photographs \"in order for the debate around them to be fully informed\".</p> <p>Hunt said he did not believe the Sun was acting in the public interest but said it wasn't his place to tell editors what to do. Speaking to BBC News, he said: \"Personally I cannot see what the public interest was in publishing those.</p> <p>\"But we have a free press and I don't think it is right for politicians to tell newspaper editors what they can and cannot publish. That must be a matter for the newspaper editors.</p> <p>\"I just hope that people won't remember this, but they will remember the amazing good work that Prince Harry has done.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We can agree with what someone like Mr Murdoch does or you can disagree with it. But in the end it is not for politicians to tell editors what to publish. As I understand it even Buckingham Palace have said that editors have a right to publish what they want to and that is a matter for editors.\"</p> <p>The publication comes at a sensitive time, ahead of what is expected to be a highly critical report by Lord Justice Leveson into press ethics following the public inquiry which was launched following the phone-hacking scandal at Rupert Murdoch's now defunct News of the World.</p> <p>Journalists on the Sun and other tabloids believe Leveson has already had a taming effect on the British media and say if the News of the World was still around it would have served up as many titillating pictures of Harry as possible for Sunday breakfasts.</p> <p>News International has refused to comment on the speculation that Murdoch personally sanctioned publication but insiders say executives wanted to fire a warning shot across Leveson's bows.</p> <p>One executive said if it hadn't published the photos, the \"line in the sand would be drawn in the wrong place\" in terms of the boundaries of privacy.</p> <p>Sources at the Leveson inquiry say Lord Justice Leveson will have noted the issues surrounding publication but it was \"unlikely\" that the appeals court judge would be summoning anyone from the paper to explain themselves.</p> <p>There has been mixed reaction to the publication of the pictures \u2013 the Daily Mail published an editorial in full support of the paper even though it decided against publication itself.</p> <p>However, media lawyers are less convinced. Christopher Hutchings of Hamlins law firm said the Sun's decision was commercially motivated. \"It has calculated that the risk of legal action and financial penalties is outweighed by the increase in circulation which will be generated by publication,\" he said.</p> <p>Louise Mensch, the soon-to-quit Tory MP and a supporter of Rupert Murdoch, has said the publication was in the public interest as Prince Harry receives money from the civil list and his royal protection squad are funded by the taxpayer.</p> <p>Opposing publication, Lord Prescott attacked the Sun for publishing the pictures, saying it proved that self-regulation of the press is dead.</p>",

The offensive appeared to be part of a larger struggle for control of the southern fringe of the capital. Local residents said that government tanks on the Damascus ring road shelled the neighbourhoods of al-Lawwan and Nahr Aisheh late into Saturday night and that there was also heavy fighting in the Ghouta suburbs to the east of the city.</p> <p>The LCC said forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad had killed a total of 440 people across Syria on Saturday alone. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/syriaohr\" title=\"\">The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based activist group </a>drawing information from a network of monitors across Syria, put the nationwide death toll for the day at 370 including 174 civilians. If confirmed, it is one of the bloodiest days the country has suffered since the anti-Assad revolt broke out in March 2011.</p> <p>It was impossible to verify such claims because of severe Syrian government restrictions on independent or foreign media coverage.

Three bullets hit her in the back and her parents brought her to a makeshift hospital. Nothing could be done for her,\" he said.</p> <p>A thorough investigation of atrocity claims can only be carried out by the international criminal court in the the Hague if it is given a mandate by the UN security council, but that has been blocked by Russia, the Assad regime's principal backer and arms supplier, together with China. Moscow and Beijing have also vetoed resolutions threatening Assad with sanctions for non-compliance with a peace plan backed by the UN and the Arab League. The last UN monitors in Damascus left earlier this month when the security council failed to agree on a new mandate for them.</p> <p>Western officials say they have largely given up on security council diplomacy and are stepping up their assistance to the fragmented opposition, though they say that assistance stops short of weapons. However, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are reported to be shipping arms to rebel groups as the conflict continues to escalate.</p> <p>Iran is the regime's only major ally in the region and Iranian officials have said that Revolutionary Guards have fought alongside Assad's troops. Syria's Vice-President Farouk al-Sharaa met an Iranian delegation on Sunday, according to Syria's state news agency, marking his first appearance in several weeks. It put an end to opposition rumours that he had defected.</p> <p>In the increasingly daunting search for a diplomatic solution, the UN and Arab League have appointed a new special envoy, a veteran Algerian diplomat, Lakhdar Brahimi, after the resignation of the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan. On Friday, Brahimi declared himself \"honoured, flattered, humbled and scared\" to be given the job.</p>",
  "<p>One can object to some of its particulars, but Frank Bruni has a quite interesting and incisive <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/bruni-gullibility-in-politics-and-in-film.html?_r=1\">New York Times column today</a> about a <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20120816/NEWS01/308160088?nclick_check=1\">new independent film</a> called Compliance, which explores the human desire to follow and obey authority. </p> <p>Based on <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051009/NEWS01/510090392\">real-life events</a> that took place in 2004 at a McDonalds in Kentucky, the film dramatizes a prank telephone call in which a man posing as a police officer manipulates a supervisor to abuse an employee with increasing amounts of cruelty and sadism, ultimately culminating in sexual assault \u2013 all by insisting that the abuse is necessary to aid an official police investigation into petty crimes. </p> <p>That particular episode was <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051009/NEWS01/510090392\">but one of a series</a> of similar and almost always-successful hoaxes over the course of at least 10 years, in which restaurant employees were manipulated into obeying warped directives from this same man, pretending on the telephone to be a police officer.</p> <p>Bruni correctly notes the prime issue raised by all of this: \"How much can people be talked into and how readily will they defer to an authority figure of sufficient craft and cunning?\" That question was answered 50 years ago by the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcvSNg0HZwk\">infamous experiment</a> conducted by psychologist Stanley Milgram, in which an authority figure in a lab coat instructed participants to deliver what they were told were increasingly severe electric shocks to someone in another room whom they could hear but not see. Even as the screams became louder and more agonizing, two-thirds of the participants were induced fully to comply by delivering the increased electric shocks. </p> <p>Most disturbingly, even as many expressed concerns and doubts, they continued to obey until the screams stopped \u2013 presumably due to death (<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2765416&amp;page=1#.UDoCeKMunDM\">subsequent experiments</a> replicated those results). As the University of California's Gregorio Billikopf <a href=\"http://cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7article/article35.htm\">put it</a>, the Milgram experiment \"illustrates people's reluctance to confront those who abuse power\", as they \"obey either out of fear or out of a desire to appear co-operative \u2013 even when acting against their own better judgment and desires\".</p> <p>Bruni ties all of this into our current political culture, noting one significant factor driving this authoritarian behavior: that trusting authority is easier and more convenient than treating it with skepticism. He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>As Craig Zobel, the writer and director of 'Compliance,' said to me on the phone on Friday, 'We can't be on guard all the time. In order to have a pleasant life, you have to be able to trust that people are who they say they are. And if you questioned everything you heard, you'd never get anything done.' It's infinitely more efficient to follow a chosen leader and walk in lock step with a chosen tribe.</p> </blockquote> <p>He suggests that this is the dynamic that drives unthinking partisan allegiance (\"What's most distinctive about the current presidential election and our political culture [is] \u2026 how unconditionally so many partisans back their side's every edict, plaint and stratagem\"), as well as numerous key political frauds, from Saddam's WMDs to Obama's fake birth certificate to Romney's failure to pay taxes for 10 years. People eagerly accept such evidence-free claims \"because the alternative mean[s] confronting outright mendacity from otherwise respected authorities, trading the calm of certainty for the disquiet of doubt\".</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/03/09/the_authoritarian_mind/\">authoritarian desire</a> to pledge fealty to institutions and leaders is indeed the dynamic that resides <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/27/the_authoritarian_mind_2/\">at the core</a> of so many of our political conflicts (<a href=\"http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf\">the 2006 book</a> by Canadian psychology professor Bob Altemeyer, The Authoritarians, is a superb examination of how this <a href=\"http://la.indymedia.org/news/2001/10/12432_comment.php\">manifests in the right-wing political context</a>). </p> <p>One of my first posts when I began writing about politics back in 2006 was an <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com.br/2006/02/do-bush-followers-have-political.html\">examination of the blindly loyal, cult-like veneration</a> which the American Right had erected around George Bush; as Paul Krugman was one of the first to observe, that same disturbing thirst for leader-worship then drove followers of Barack Obama (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/opinion/11krugman.html\">Krugman in February, 2008</a>: \"the Obama campaign seems dangerously close to becoming a cult of personality. We've already had that from the Bush administration \u2013 remember Operation Flight Suit? We really don't want to go there again\").</p> <p>There is always much to say about this topic, as its centrality in shaping both individual and collective behavior is more or less universal. But I want to highlight two specific points about all of this which relate to several of the topics I wrote about in my first week here, as well as some of the resulting reaction to that:</p> <p><em>First</em>, there are multiple institutions that are intended to safeguard against this ease of inducing blind trust in and obedience to authorities. The most obvious one is journalism, which, at its best, serves as a check against political authority by subjecting its pronouncements to skepticism and scrutiny, and by acting in general as an adversarial force against it. But there are other institutions that can and should play a similar role. </p> <p>One is academia, a realm where tenure is supposed to ensure that authority's most sacred orthodoxies are subjected to unrelenting, irreverent questioning. Another is the federal judiciary, whose officials are vested with life tenure so as to empower them, without regard to popular sentiment, to impose limits on the acts of political authorities and to protect the society's most scorned and marginalized. </p> <p>But just observe how frequently these institutions side with power rather than against it, how eagerly they offer their professional and intellectual instruments to justify and glorify the acts of political authority rather than challenge or subvert them. They will occasionally quibble on the margins with official acts, but their energies are overwhelmingly devoted to endorsing the legitimacy of institutional authority and, correspondingly, scorning those who have been marginalized or targeted by it. </p> <p>Their collective instinct on any issue is to rush to align themselves with the sentiment prevailing in elite power circles. Most denizens in these realms would be hard-pressed to identify any instances in which they embraced causes or people deeply unpopular within those circles. Indeed, they judge their own rightness \u2013 they derive vindication \u2013 by how often they find themselves on the side of elite institutions and how closely aligned they are with the orthodoxies that prevail within them, rather than by how often they challenge or oppose them.</p> <p>It is difficult to overstate the impact of this authority-serving behavior from the very institutions designed to oppose authority. As Zobel, the writer and director of Compliance, notes, most people are too busy with their lives to find the time or energy to scrutinize prevailing orthodoxies and the authorities propagating them. When the institutions that are in a position to provide those checks fail to do that, those orthodoxies and authorities thrive without opposition or challenge, no matter how false and corrupted they may be. </p> <p>As much as anything else, this is the institutional failure that explains the debacles of the last decade. There is virtually no counter-weight to the human desire to follow and obey authority because the institutions designed to provide that counter-weight \u2013 media outlets, academia, courts \u2013 do the opposite: they are the most faithful servants of those centers of authority.</p> <p><em>Second</em>, it is very easy to get people to see oppression and tyranny in faraway places, but very difficult to get them to see it in their own lives (<em>\"How dare you compare my country to Tyranny X; we're free and they aren't\"</em>). In part that is explained by the way in which desire shapes perception. One naturally wants to believe that oppression is only something that happens elsewhere because one then feels good about one's own situation (<em>\"I'm free, unlike those poor people in those other places\"</em>). Thinking that way also relieves one of the obligation to act: one who believes they are free of oppression will feel no pressure to take a difficult or risky stand against it.</p> <p>But the more significant factor is that one can easily remain free of even the most intense political oppression simply by placing one's faith and trust in institutions of authority. People who get themselves to be satisfied with the behavior of their institutions of power, or who at least largely acquiesce to the legitimacy of prevailing authority, are almost never subjected to any oppression, even in the worst of tyrannies. </p> <p>Why would they be? Oppression is designed to compel obedience and submission to authority. Those who voluntarily put themselves in that state \u2013 by believing that their institutions of authority are just and good and should be followed rather than subverted \u2013 render oppression redundant, unnecessary. </p> <p>Of course people who think and behave this way encounter no oppression. That's their reward for good, submissive behavior. As Rosa Luxemburg put this: \"Those who do not move, do not notice their chains.\" They are left alone by institutions of power because they comport with the desired behavior of complacency and obedience without further compulsion.</p> <p>But the fact that good, obedient citizens do not themselves perceive oppression does not mean that oppression does not exist. Whether a society is free is determined not by the treatment of its complacent, acquiescent citizens \u2013 such people are always unmolested by authority \u2013 but rather by the treatment of its dissidents and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/16/personalizing_civil_liberties_abuses/\">its marginalized minorities</a>. </p> <p>In the US, those are the people who are detained at airports and have their laptops and notebooks seized with no warrants because of the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/08/u_s_filmmaker_repeatedly_detained_at_border/\">films they make</a> or the <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2011/01/12/wikileaks-volunteer-1.html\">political activism they engage in</a>; or who are <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/nypd-official-muslim-spying-in-neighborhoods-led-to-no-leads-terror-cases-in-over-6-years/2012/08/21/e14d96f6-eb5b-11e1-866f-60a00f604425_story.html\">subjected to mass, invasive state surveillance</a> despite no evidence of wrongdoing; or who are <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/09/04/speech_23\">prosecuted and imprisoned for decades</a> \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/06/01/free_speech_4/\">or even executed without due process</a> \u2013 for expressing political and religious views deemed dangerous by the government.</p> <p>People who resist the natural human tendency to follow, venerate and obey prevailing authority typically have <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/20/we_do_not_live_in_a\">a much different view</a> about how oppressive a society is than those who submit to those impulses. The most valuable experiences for determining how free a society is are the experiences of society's most threatening dissidents, not its content and compliant citizens. It was those who marched against Mubarak who were detained, beaten, tortured and killed, not those who acquiesced to or supported the regime. That is the universal pattern of authoritarian oppression.</p> <p>The temptation to submit to authority examined by Compliance bolsters an authoritarian culture by transforming its leading institutions into servants of power rather than checks on it. But worse, it conceals the presence of oppression by ensuring that most citizens, choosing to follow, trust and obey authority, do not personally experience oppression and thus do not believe \u2013 refuse to believe \u2013 that it really exists.</p>",

Most of the children had been suspected of stone-throwing.</p> <p>The witness statements were gathered to show the \"common reality\" of acts of violence by soldiers towards Palestinians, including children, in the West Bank, said Yehuda Shaul of Breaking the Silence. \"Sadly enough this is the moral consequence of prolonged occupation of the Palestinian people,\" he said.</p> <p>One former soldier describes serving in Hebron in 2010: \"You never know their names, you never talk with them, they always cry, shit in their pants \u2026 There are those annoying moments when you're on an arrest mission, and there's no room in the police station, so you just take the kid back with you, blindfold him, put him in a room and wait for the police to come and pick him up in the morning. He sits there like a dog \u2026\"</p> <p>Children frequently soiled themselves, according to the testimonies. \"I remember hearing him shitting his pants \u2026 I also remember some other time when someone pissed in his pants. I just became so indifferent to it, I couldn't care less. I heard him do it, I witnessed his embarrassment. I also smelled it. But I didn't care,\" said another.</p> <p>Another soldier describes an incident in Qalqiliya in 2007 in which a boy was arrested for throwing stones. \"At the end of the day, something has to make these kids stop throwing stones on the road because they can kill,\" he said.</p> <p>\"That specific kid who actually lay there on the ground, begging for his life, was actually nine years oldI mean, a kid has to beg for his life? A loaded gun is pointed at him and he has to plead for mercy? This is something that scars him for life. But I think if we hadn't entered the village at that point, then stones would be thrown the next day and perhaps the next time someone would be wounded or killed as a result.\"</p> <p>Some of the statements illustrate the disjunction between the Israeli military and Palestinians. One soldier said: \"You put up a checkpoint out of boredom, sit there for a few hours and then continue on. Once I saw kids passing, and one of the guys, a reservist who spoke Arabic, wanted to ask them what they study. He didn't mean it in any bad way. Then I saw how the kid nearly peed his pants as the guy tried to kid with him, how the two worlds are simply disconnected. The guy was kidding and the kid was scared to death.\"</p> <p>Most of the soldiers have given testimonies anonymously. One, who spoke to the Guardian, said he had been given no guidance during his training for military service on how to deal with minors. He said children were sometimes arrested and interrogated, not because they were suspected of an offence, but to try to elicit information about older family members or neighbours.</p> <p>He had given a witness statement to Breaking the Silence because \"I thought that people who don't see this on an everyday basis should know what's going on.\" He said many Israelis were unwilling to acknowledge the reality of the military occupation in the West Bank. \"It's very easy [for the Israeli public] to be completely detached. It's a hard thing to handle \u2013 stuff like that being done in your name.\"</p> <p>According to Gerard Horton of Defence for Children International \u2013 Palestine (DCI) the testimonies confirm a pattern of behaviour uncovered by his organisation's research into the treatment of Palestinian children by the Israeli security forces.</p> <p>DCI and other human rights organisations say Palestinian children are routinely arrested at night, handcuffed, blindfolded, mistreated and denied access to their parents or a lawyer.</p> <p>\"For years credible reports of human rights abuses against children living under Israeli military occupation have emerged,\" he said. \"These latest testimonies from young soldiers given the task of enforcing the occupation provide further evidence of its deeply corrosive effects on all. The testimonies lay bare the day-to-day reality of the occupation. These are not isolated incidents or a question of 'a few bad apples'. This is the natural and foreseeable consequence of government policy.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces said that Breaking the Silence had declined to provide the IDF with testimonies ahead of publication so they could be verified and investigated.</p> <p>He said its true intention was \"to generate negative publicity regarding the IDF and its soldiers. The IDF has in the past, and continues to, call upon the organisation to immediately convey complaints or suspicions of improper conduct to the relevant authorities. In line with the IDF's ethical commitments, any such incidents will be thoroughly investigated.\"</p>",
  "<p>What's so special about you? Historically, that's a really important question. For centuries it had to do with the God you worshipped and the religion to which you belonged. I'm a follower of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh\">Yahweh</a>, of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda\">Ahura Mazda</a>, of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis\">Isis</a> \u2013 that's who I am. But today we live in what we like to call a secular age and the key point about secularism is that it is designed to be the great dissolver of difference. Secularism \u2013 which finds its most powerful manifesto in <a href=\"http://www.masshist.org/thomasjeffersonpapers/cfm/doc.cfm?id=declaration_1&amp;mode=sm\">The American Declaration of Independence</a> \u2013</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br>\u2013 is essentially a political solution to the acute problems thrown up in an increasingly multicultural world, a world in which different identities and different cultures have all been thrown into the same tumble dryer. It is an ideology designed to neutralise the differences created by our pre-existing sense of identity and specialness, to universalise ourselves, so to speak, out of the thicket of problems created by globalisation.</p> <p>In And Man Created God, I argue that the Christian ideology represented a similar attempt to universalise specialness in response to the first phase of globalisation created under the Pax Romana. St Paul turned the small and obscure Jesus cult into a religion fit for viral spreading within that newly globalised world. He did so by making clear that his God would love us as <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/108/51/3.html\">\"neither Greek nor Jew\"</a>. In other words, we were all identically special under His loving gaze. The thousands of people daily crowding into the new cities and leaving behind their village, tribe and customs lapped it up. Empire needed us to forget our differences, and Paul provided the belief system that would do that.</p> <p>It was bound to fail: you can't really flatten difference \u2013 it is our difference from \"the others\" that defines \"us\" as a group. In many ways Paul compounded the problem. By making each of us equally special, he also conferred on each of us the moral authority to challenge all other forms of authority and to create opposing groups. West European Christians split into fervent, righteous sects after the Reformation, and the remnants of the old Western Roman empire was torn apart by war. In its place emerged the ideology of secularism. It was born, not out of the re-discovery of Greek reason but from exhaustion with the bloodshed spilt over religious bigotry.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia\">Peace of Westphalia of 1648</a> which brought the Thirty Years War to an end is the document that starts to cobble secularism together by getting each sovereign to think of his Christian minorities as having rights which it was the state's duty to protect. It became their rights, not their heretical souls, that were precious. And as God was slowly forced out of his dominant role in our affairs, the sovereign started to fill the space vacated. The secular sovereign seeks to replace our old sense of specialness with a new one. \"I am not the purveyor of the one true faith but the protector of all religious traditions,\" he says. \"Each of your groups and identities is protected and special in my eyes.\" The specialness of each of us, our need to belong, to love and be loved would come through our nation and its glory.</p> <p>We often tend to underestimate just how much energy and effort our political and cultural leaders devote to disseminating the values of this secularist ideology. Just as Virgil was employed by the Emperor Augustus to create the <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.1.i.html\">Aeneid</a> \u2013 perhaps the greatest foundation myth an empire has ever self-consciously commissioned \u2013 so Hollywood is used to promote the overarching values of secularist America. The Pentagon, for example, loans its astronomically expensive military toys to Hollywood filmmakers in exchange for the right to change scripts, thereby purveying to the world its own glorification of the US military (and by extension, the US empire). The classic example was Top Gun, a film so nakedly dedicated to hymning the wonders of American specialness, that the Pentagon decided to set up recruitment booths in every major cinema.</p> <p>But it's an uphill struggle. In the first place, the market \u2013 the driving force behind globalisation \u2013 tends to promote a competing ideology of individual empowerment and choice, offering a rival, if insubstantial, sense of specialness and identity through consumption: you are what brand you buy; you are your mePhone or your mePad. But more fundamentally the secular sovereign is hobbled by the need to achieve two contradictory ambitions: to diffuse the viciousness created by competing notions of \"specialness\" on the one hand; on the other, to endow members of the group with the \"specialness\" that the disappearing God no longer provides. Hollywood, the monarchy, national sporting contests \u2013 all can do their bit to unite us in love and pride of nation; and so we spend billions on Olympics and jubilees. And it works \u2026 for a bit. But by trying to be both purveyor and destroyer of specialness, the secular sovereign is never quite making its demanding subjects special enough, nor eliminating their demand to be special.</p> <p>After reading my book, Paul Morris, professor of religious studies at Victoria University of Wellington, made an intriguing observation. He felt that St Paul had suffered from \"premature universalism\" \u2013 that he had tried to rush the special relationship of Yaweh to the Jews into a special relationship of God to anyone who had faith. And one is tempted to say that the same is true of our own age \u2013 that we, likewise, have been subject to a bout of \"premature secularism\". Since at least the 1960s, the assumption has been that religion was on its way out, that secular ideology would dissolve all religious attachments. It was an assumption integral to the secular idea of \"progress\". With what alarm do we now look up to see that modern secular society is host to religious fundamentalism of all varieties.</p> <p>All of which suggests that if secularism persists in being God-like in its ambitions \u2013 if , like St Paul, it insists on the eradication of the identities that have traditionally sustained us, then it is likely to buckle under the weight of its own contradictions.</p> <p><strong>Selina O'Grady appeared at the Edinburgh International Book Festival on 22 August 2012</strong></p>",
  "<p>Perhaps the most radical innovation of monotheism is the idea that there can be truth in religion. Ritual doesn't raise questions of truth: the act is the meaning and cannot be false, although it can be wrongly performed. In a similar way, myths in their early forms are like Groucho Marx's principles: if you don't like them, there are others. As <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061439\" title=\"\">Bellah puts it</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The way to change a mythic culture is to tell a different story, usually only a somewhat different story, which does not involve denying any previous story. The commonly remarked 'tolerance' of polytheism, as noted by David Hume, for example, is not the moral virtue of tolerance as we understand it today, but is part of the very structure of mythic culture. Some myths and the gods whose actions they recount may be more central than others, but the issue of truth and falsity doesn't arise. The very idea of myth as 'a story that is not true' is a product of the axial age: in tribal and archaic societies, believers in one myth have no need to find the myths of others false.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So it is not entirely surprising that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten\" title=\"\">Akhenaten</a>'s experiment in monotheism was completely forgotten within 50 years of his death, and would have remained unknown for ever if his tomb had not been excavated, more than 2,500 years later. He made an enormous wound in the structure of Egyptian thought, although it was quickly healed. In one sense, his move was totalitarian, for the one god he worshipped was still partially identified with the pharaoh. This form of monotheism represents a monstrous new concentration of power \u2013 in a mythical polytheism there are always other gods to whom you can flee, who are not identified with the king.</p> <p>It would be a thousand years before the experiment was repeated. When it happened again, it was not in Egypt, at the summit of its power, but in the tribe of Israel, a miserable and battered people between great empires, sometimes entirely extinguished as a nation.</p> <p>Archaic Israel was not monotheistic. The Old Testament is not a reliable historical record even of the development of Jewish thought. \"The single most central figure in the Hebrew Bible, Moses, has no more historicity than Agamemnon or Aeneas\" says Bellah, though the name is undeniably Egyptian, which gives some credence to the idea of an exodus. \"If there were a people called Israel in the hill country of northern Palestine in the late 13th century, as the victory stele of Pharaoh Mereptah indicates, it was of marginal importance.\"</p> <p>He goes on to discount almost all the foundational myths of Judeo-Christian history, even the claim that the Jews had a distinctive and coherent religious history: Yahweh was not the original God of Israel, but a latecomer arriving from Edom. The original God of Israel had been El \u2013 this is obvious even from the name: had it meant \"Yahweh rules\", it would have been \"Isra-yahu\". And it is possible that El was not even one God, but a generic name for numerous gods, spirits, or ancestors. Perhaps, Bellah says, the creature with whom Jacob wrestled at the ford of Jabbok was not God, nor even an angel, but a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ROFTn0\">Powerful Being</a>, as we have seen in primitive societies.</p> <p>In some myths, El had fathered Yahweh by his wife, the goddess Asherah. So far as we can reconstruct, every myth about El had him as one or several tribal deities contending with many others. Originally this was true of Yahweh, too.</p> <p>Only the faintest traces of this history are to be found in the Pentateuch. Although these first five books of the Bible deal with the most distant past, from the creation of the world to Moses, they are also the most recently composed of its historical books. Bellah takes them to be a collection arranged under the Babylonian captivity, at least 600 years after the events they purport to describe. They are a reframing of older myths to justify the monotheism that had come to define Israel in captivity. Within them, Moses becomes the one man who can speak to the One God \u2013 and he has the inestimable advantage, as the source and guarantor of the law, that he is dead. His words are immortal, but their interpreters must be living men.</p> <p>In a passage that displays his masterly knotting together of psychology and sociology, reason and emotion, Bellah sets out the importance of this transformation: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"If we understand the Moses narrative not as a historical account but as a charter for a new kind of people, a people under God, not under a king, an idea parallel to Athenian democracy though longer lasting, then we might see Moses as a kind of 'transitional object,' as a way for people who knew only monarchical regimes to give up the king and begin to understand what an alternative regime might be like.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Think of Ethiopia and what do you see. Perhaps a starving child, flies in her eyes and belly distended. Painfully thin adults in raggedy clothes, staring balefully at the camera in a fetid refugee camp. Or possibly a famous self-declared saviour from the west, striding purposefully past the decaying corpse of an animal beside a dusty road.</p> <p>Think again. See, instead, a booming capital city, its cafes filled with graduates and cranes lining the horizon. A nation that is one of the world's largest livestock producers and recently became the second country to take delivery of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19293543\" title=\"\">Boeing's new 787 passenger jet</a>. An economy that doubled in size this century and is growing at 7.5%.</p> <p>Few countries symbolise the disconnect between outdated western perceptions of Africa and fast-changing&#xa0;realities on the ground better than Ethiopia, the continent's second most-populous nation, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-meles-zenawi-dies-illneses\" title=\"\">long-serving leader, Meles Zenawi, died last week</a>. Although&#xa0;the example of one country can never fully explain a diverse continent, this ancient nation illustrates in many ways Africa's progress, potential and problems. Mostly, it is a picture of amazing progress, far removed from the usual stereotypes presented by much of the media and their allies in the aid lobby. They offer simplistic images of death and destruction, ignoring complex realities of a continent encompassing 54 countries and 11.6 million square miles in which life is becoming more peaceful and prosperous.</p> <p>Last week, Africa was in the news over the shooting of striking miners in South Africa, a disturbing echo of the dark days of apartheid. The tragedy highlighted the failure of the party of liberation to deliver social justice in government; the nation is now the world's most unequal society. But it is worth remembering the country is a democracy, with free expression, a fine constitution and some accountability for those deemed responsible.</p> <p>Ethiopia's Zenawi was part of what Bill Clinton and Tony Blair hailed as the new generation of African leaders, heralding an African renaissance alongside <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kagame\" title=\"\">Paul Kagame</a> in Rwanda and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoweri_Museveni\" title=\"\">Yoweri Museveni</a> in Uganda. Politically, they failed to deliver, festering in office as despotic autocrats.</p> <p>But there is a new Africa emerging, powered by capitalism, embracing globalisation and finally shaking off the shackles of colonialism and the cold war that proved so crippling to development. Just look at the land of Live Aid: one of the world's fastest-growing nations, a sub-Saharan success story like six more of the 10 most expanding economies. Poverty is far from banished \u2013 it's a grinding way of life for millions \u2013 but their numbers are falling fast.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart\" title=\"\">global top 10</a> also includes Ghana, which grew by more than 14% last year and whose cherished democracy sets such a great example; Mozambique, rising like a phoenix from the devastation of a long civil war; and Nigeria, the continent's potential superpower. Bundle all African countries together and they have grown faster for much of the past decade than East Asia.</p> <p>Some dismiss this as just a consequence of the continent's rich resources at a time of rampant development in many parts of the globe. Certainly, oil has fuelled spectacular growth in several countries, while others have made recent discoveries of deposits that ensure Africa will play an increasingly critical geopolitical role. But Ethiopia does not pump any petroleum, relying instead on exports such as cattle, coffee and cut flowers; the value of these exports quadrupled in under a decade.</p> <p>This is the youngest continent, enjoying a demographic dividend with a working population growing by around 10-12 million people each year. An emerging middle class \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/may/05/one-three-africans-middle-class\" title=\"\">one-third of Africans</a>, according to one analysis \u2013 is behind an explosion in consumerism. Already, Africans spend more per head than Indians on goods and services.</p> <p>There are still huge hurdles, with sclerotic border controls, stifling bureaucracy, sluggish courts and sleazy corruption. Infrastructure, while improving, remains inadequate \u2013 one reason for the boom in mobile phones transforming everything from agriculture to healthcare. Young Africans \u2013 impatient for change, innovative and increasingly well-educated \u2013 are using mobile technologies to solve problems presented by poor services and political stagnation.</p> <p>And this vibrant continent is getting even younger, with plummeting levels of child mortality and falling fertility. Ethiopia, where nearly half the 84 million population is under the age of 15, is one of 10 countries seeing incredible falls in <a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2012/05/africas-child-health-miracle-the-biggest-best-story-in-development.php\" title=\"\">infant death rates</a> of more than 5% a year. In Senegal, the decline is twice that, stunning figures without precedent in recent history.</p> <p>There has been no single cause of this child health miracle, attributed to a mix of better governance, new technologies and improved health policies, while for all the enduring chaos in the Democratic Republic of Congo, conflict is becoming rarer and more localised. Even Somalia, ripped apart by civil war, is making a faltering return to normality; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/somalia-first-parliament-inaugurated\" title=\"\">last week, it convened its first parliament since 1991</a>. As Michael Clemens, an economist at the Centre for Global Development, said: \"This will be startling news for anyone who still thinks sub-Saharan Africa is mired in unending poverty and death. That Africa is slipping away.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, this message is failing&#xa0;to filter through to the west, where too many people remain locked into stale narratives of Africa as a land of suffering in need of our salvation. This is to our long-term detriment, especially in Britain, with such strong historic ties, a common language in many countries and the soft power strength of pop music and Premier League football. Twenty years ago, there was virtual economic dependence on Europe; today, half of Africa's trade is with other developing nations \u2013 and not&#xa0;just China.</p> <p>The continent is on the edge of economic takeoff similar to those seen so dramatically in China and India. For all the problems that still exist, a recent&#xa0;survey found investors in Africa&#xa0;are overwhelmingly positive, while those not there are unfailingly negative. These anachronistic attitudes&#xa0;reflect the west's myopic view, but we cannot afford to cling on to them in a world changing so fast. It is time to recognise the emergence of the new Africa.</p>"
