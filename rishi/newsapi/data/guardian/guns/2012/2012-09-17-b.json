  "<p>The political failure of the former justice secretary, Ken Clarke's, sentencing reforms means the prison and probation services are set to miss targets for deep spending cuts set by the Treasury, Whitehall's spending watchdog has warned.</p> <p>The National Audit Office says that official hopes of saving money by reducing the record prison population of 86,000 in England and Wales by 6,000 and closing older, more expensive prisons have been dashed. Jail numbers are now not expected to fall significantly over the next few years.</p> <p>The Whitehall spending watchdog also warns that prison and probation budgets could come under further pressure from even slight changes in demand and would be placed in even deeper difficulties by any repeat of last summer's riots or a more punitive approach by the courts.</p> <p>The problem is likely to lead to the new justice secretary, Chris Grayling, pushing through a round of spending cuts and accelerating the move to greater privatisation in prisons and probation.</p> <p>A National Audit Office report published on Tuesday also discloses that the national offender management service, the agency that runs prisons and probation, faces an unexpected bill of up to \u00a335m in 2012/13 to resolve problems in two case management and offender risk assessment computer projects. Both have been designated as \"high risk\" needing a high degree of scrutiny.</p> <p>\"The national offender management service is less than halfway through its cost cutting programme but is already lagging behind its target to curb spending by \u00a3884m before March 2015,\" said Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons public accounts committee. \"This figure must be hit if the Ministry of Justice is to stand any chance of achieving \u00a32bn annual savings by the same deadline.\"</p> <p>The NAO says that Clarke's sentencing reform programme, which included sentence discounts of up to 50% for early guilty pleas, was designed to reduce the size of the prison population by 6,000 by 2015. But Clarke was forced to drop key elements of the package last year after a row over his remarks over the sentencing of rape cases.</p> <p>The Whitehall spending watchdog says the price of that decision was the loss of \u00a3130m of potential savings. The sentencing reform package is now expected to lead to only 2,000 fewer prison places, mainly as a result of changes to remand legislation, but the Treasury has not reduced targets for savings. \"Given the loss of these reforms, the prison population is now unlikely to fall significantly over the next few years. This limits the agency's plans to close older, more expensive, prisons and bring down costs,\" says the NAO. It reports that this year's target to find \u00a3246m in savings is already \"challenging\" as it is currently projected to spend \u00a332m more than its budget. It also faces a \u00a366m shortfall in the \u00a3122m it needs to fund early staff departures over the next two years.</p>",

  "<p>Back in August, the work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith accused the BBC's economics editor, Stephanie Flanders, of \"peeing all over British industry\" and the corporation in general of being biased against the government's efforts to manage the economy. That was a bit harsh, given that it's becoming increasingly difficult to find any serious economist who thinks the government does have a viable economic strategy, but even so, the first episode of Flanders' new three-part series, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mzqw9\" title=\"\"><strong>Masters of Money</strong></a> (BBC2), on John Maynard Keynes won't have done anything to soothe the nerves at the Treasury.</p> <p>The premise for the programme was intriguing. Take three of the most influential economic theorists of the past 150 years \u2013 Keynes, Hayek and Marx \u2013 and try to examine how they would have interpreted the current mess and what they would have said needed to be done to put it right. In less capable hands, this could either have been wilfully impenetrable or hopelessly simplistic, but Flanders pitched it just about right; enough rigour to make it worthwhile, not too much jargon to make it a snooze.</p> <p>Best of all, Flanders is passionate about her subject. Economics isn't some dry debate about why we're all going broke for her; she lives and breathes the subject. Which probably makes her not always the best company for a fun night out, but the ideal guide to an hour's night in front of the TV.</p> <p>She was also passionate about Keynes \u2013 at times she sounded like his cheerleader-in-chief \u2013 and if his economic theories are even half right, then the government's current \"No Plan B\" slash-and-burn policy to debt isn't just going to leave the UK's economy stalling indefinitely, then we could be on the verge of another European war. That's if we haven't gone to war anywhere else first. Worryingly, instead of being alarmed by this, I came away feeling reassured, as it was a vision of the world that somehow made sense. I'll be interested to see if Flanders can maintain the superlatives for Hayek.</p> <p>What was missing, though, was any sense of whether economics is a scientific subject with any predictive value. We know governments believe it has \u2013 they have to, or they might as well give up now; and we know economists do \u2013 they also have to, for much the same reason. But that is quite another thing from it being so. For how are we to explain an otherwise intelligent person saying things such as: \"We are putting an end to boom and bust economics?\" Did Gordon Brown really believe he was that much in control of an economy that was underpinned by a housing bubble and unserviceable debt? And why did so few people who were paid to know better ever challenge him? Presumably because it was in their self-interest not to. Keynes wrote of the \"animal spirits\" in the market, which to my uneconomic ears sounded suspiciously like arrogance, delusion and greed. In which case, what the economy needs isn't Keynes or any other wonk; it's a good shrink.</p> <p>All the transactions in Jane Corbin's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mxvlw\" title=\"\"><strong>Panorama: Price Tag Wars</strong></a> (BBC1) were strictly non-financial. Rather, the price tags in question were the retaliatory attacks by the \"Hilltop Youth\" Jewish settlers on the West Bank against the Palestinians \u2013 and the Israeli government \u2013 for incursions into, and the destruction of, their homes. At least, retaliation was what they claimed it was, though Corbin turned up equally compelling evidence to suggest that many of the attacks were provocative and condoned by the Israeli army.</p> <p>Officially, the Israeli government has decreed that the Hilltop Youth are terrorists and several Jewish settlers have already been imprisoned. But it's a murky old world out there: the Israeli government is perfectly happy with its own 130-odd state-sanctioned settlements, despite the fact they have been deemed illegal under international law, and merely wants to take down the 100 or so settlements that various Israelis had decided to establish for themselves. As so often in disputes involving Israelis and Palestinians, everyone in this intelligent and understated documentary declared that they were 100% right about everything and had no intention of reconsidering their position. With so much intransigence and certainty on offer, they might as well have been economists. Mind you, even with the Tories in charge, I'd say there was a better chance of an economic recovery than a solution to the conflict in the Middle-East.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>7.00pm:<strong> Around the same time Sergio Ag\u00fcero was ripping off his shirt, </strong>Joe Hart was doing the aeroplane and some foolish Manchester City fans were groping their way home through great big bubbles of tears, Everton supporters must have been wearing grins as broad as the Amazon during rainy season. The smiles had nothing to do with City winning ... hold on, you think that Amazon reference was an exaggeration don't you? But let's do the maths. There was 39,517 at the games so let's guesstimate and say there was about 35,000 there at the end each wearing a smile about three inches long. That's about 2.67 kilometers. So yes, you're right, it was an exaggeration but you get the point. Anyway, back to the game and the reason for the smiles. </p> <p><strong>Just before the match Alan Pardew had the temerity to insinuate </strong>that his side were a cut above the Toffees \u2013 \"Forget about Everton and Aston Villa, we've put ourselves in a similar position to Arsenal,\" he pooped \u2013 but boy, oh boy did he pay for that. Everton went out and tore Newcastle a new castle, quenching any glimmer of Champions-League hope the Magpies had and condemning them to the 10th circle of Dante's Hell, the Europa League. In the spirit of their sponsor's logo, Everton have not forgotten Pardew's words (\"I wouldn't say there was a bit of an edge to the game on Monday, but I think it's a little bit disrespectful for someone to say something like that after one good season,\" said Big Phil Jagielka) so with fingers, toes, legs and arms crossed tonight's match might just have a spice of bite to it. Added to that is the fact that both of these sides kinda have a little something to prove \u2013 Everton need to demonstrate that that their excellent early season form is not a blip and Newcastle need to show that they can reproduce the football that thrilled us so last season. Which when you add it all together should make for a grand old game of footy. Excited? Delighted? I am. Woop! Woop!</p> <p><strong>In team news, </strong>Newcastle's squad is more undernourished than the average American Apparel moody-mouthed model so a canon of injuries is something that Pardew could really have done without. Fabio Coloccini picked up some hamstring-gah! while doing his thing for Argentina and is not just doubtful for tonight's game but \"extremely doubtful\". Snuggling up with him on the injury couch to watch the match, whilst flicking between Frontline Police and Cherry Healey: How to get a Life, is Danny Simpson, Ryan Taylor and quite possibly Cheik Tiot\u00e9. But worst of all for those who don the black and white stripes and call themselves followers of the institution that is Newcastle Football Club is the fact that Tim Krul \u2013 the man whose 15 clean sheets last season was a club record in a 38-game season \u2013 has severe elbow-ouch! and is extremely definitely out. He will (extremely probably) be replaced by Steve Harper. It was against Everton that Krul first got his chance to prove himself when he replaced an injured Harper so there is a nice sense of symmetry there for those of us who seek it.</p> <p><strong>In Everton news, </strong>who ever thought that Darron Gibson being out of a side for a while would actually be thought of as something detrimental? Well, those of you who have being watching Everton for the last bit certainly would, but those of us who just rely on do-you-get-paid-for-this stereotypes certainly would not. Either way, out he is with thigh-twang! and that means the afroed excellence of Marouane Fellaini may have to play something of a deeper role, depending on who comes in as cover for Gibbo. Steven Jerome Pienaar may also be out with a thigh-eeek! but other than that the doctor is smiling because Everton have a clean bill of health.</p> <p>We will have the official teams just as soon as the wires cough them up but don't be shy sending in your predictions and any suggestions for some half-time music.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>7.10pm: Here is those teams I promised you:</p> <p><strong>Everton (4-4-1-1):</strong> Howard; Hibbert, Baines, Jagielka, Distin; Mirallas, Neville, Osman, Pienaar; Fellaini; Jelavic</p> <p><strong>Subs: </strong>Mucha, Heitinga, Naismith, Gueye, Coleman, Anichebe, Duffy</p> <p><strong>Newcastle (4-2-3-1):</strong> Harper; Perch, S.Taylor, Williamson, Santon; Anita, Gutierrez; Ben Arfa, Cabaye, Marveaux; Ciss\u00e9.</p> <p><strong>Subs:</strong> Elliot, Tavernier, Bigirimana, Gosling, Obertan, Shola Ameobi, Ba</p> <p><strong>The man in the middle:</strong> Mike Jones </p> <p>No major surprises here except for the fact that Demba Ba is on bench. Bit of a defensive set-up that from Pardew which might just be an indicator that he is worried about the threat that Everton pose. For Everton, Hibbert shifts into the right back slot, Naismith shifts onto the bench, Phil Neville shifts to the middle alongside Osman and there is a first start for Mirallas.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.17pm: That Relentless Energy drinks ad is cringeworthy isn't it?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>7.22pm: There had been rumours <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FourthOfficial_/status/247755487846727681\">about this happening</a> but it is good to see that it has actually has. That's a very nice touch from Everton.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>7.32pm: David Moyes is staring into the camera and chatting to the boys in the Sky Studios. He looks awkward, like he has been pulled in for a police line-up and feels guilty even though we know, he knows, the whole darn world knows, that he has never done anything wrong in his entire life. In the background, Wonderwall is banging around the four walls of Goodison Park. Can we all agree that the Ryan Adams' version is much better? Good.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>7.38pm: Everton's finest Sean Moore has a respectful request. I'm not sure I can help him with this but we'll print the email anyway and see what happens. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Can the real Marouane Fellaini turns up tonight, and not the pale imitation who pranced around The Hawthorns the other week whilst I looked on aghast from my seat in the middle of the home supporters, much to the delight of the guy operating the 'Yam-Yam' Cam? It would also be nice if he would then go on to score a sublime hat-trick before pledging his long-term future to Everton. </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>7.41pm: Is anyone else ridiculously excited about watching Ben Arfa play tonight?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>7.48pm: G-Bomb reckons it's \"easy\" to stop the Fellaini machine. Just stick a man on 'im, he offers. Easily said, of course, not so easily done. Without Tiot\u00e9 does the Newcastle midfield have a man who could do such a job? Hmmm, I ain't so sure.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>7.52pm: Oliver Lewis is jumping on that Ben Arfa bandwagon with me. However, he also says he is splitting his time between that one and the one one labelled, Dreading Harper and Williamson.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>7.55pm: As per usual, the two teams are led out by mascots but as mentioned earlier, one of them is wearing a Liverpool shirt and the other is wearing an Everton one. He ain't Heavy, is now being played around the ground and on the big screen there are pictures of all those that died at Hillsborough. The crowd applaud and this is definitely one of those moments when you need to need to wipe away a tear. Well done Everton.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>1 min: Peeeeeeeeep! The whistle is blown, the ball is touched forward, and then back, and now we are underway. Everton are playing right to left.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>2 mins: Ian Dickinson has a question re the photo above. \"On the MBM photograph, is that actually Fellaini's brother or some wax simulacrum of Marouane? If the latter, is it not a little premature to bestow such a prestigious accolade on him?\" To be honest Ian, I'm not so sure.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>3 mins: <strong>Goalllllll!</strong> No, I am just pulling your tail. Nice play from Fellaini sees him doing a one-two and getting the ball back just inside the box. He shoots but Harper pushes it away. Jelavic comes crashing in, hits the ball, then the post . But his efforts goes to nothing as he was ruled offside. He really hit that post at some speed and the magic sponge looks like it has its work cut out for a moment but he is back up and running soon enough.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>6 mins: Phil Neville does his best impression of Paul Scholes on Ciss\u00e9 and is booked for his troubles. No arguing with that one and he doesn't.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>7 mins: Richard Hooker is harking back to our simulacrum chat from Saturday. Like it Richard, like it. Anyway, here's his email.</p> <blockquote> <p>Tell Ian Dickinson that that bloke next to Fellaini is definitely a second stage simulacrum. According to Baudrillard: The second stage is perversion of reality, this is where we come to believe the sign to be an unfaithful copy, which \"masks and denatures\" reality as an \"evil appearance - it is of the order of maleficence\".</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>9 mins: It has been all Everton so far. Not that there is much to report about that.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>10 mins: Everton get their tiki-taka on down the right with some good work from Osman, Neville sweeps the ball out left and there is some more nice play from the Toffees. Pienaar is found in the box, unmarked, but his shot scares the corner flag more than Harper.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>13 mins: Ben Stanley has been in touch: \"If that bloke next to Fellaini is a second stage simulacrum of Fellaini, then he must also be a third stage simulacrum of Screech from Saved By The Bell.\" MBM confession No1: I watched an old episode of Saved By The Bell the other day on YouTube.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>15 mins: <strong>Goalllllll! Everton 1-0 Newcastle (Baines, 15)</strong> Oh wow. This. Is. A. Goal. Baines plays the ball to Pienaar's feet, the South African international does the sweetest of flicks to return the ball and Banies crashes the ball past Harper in the Newcastle net. It had been coming.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>18 mins: Everton are pushing Newcastle around like a school bully does to the maths nerd who carries his lunch in a biscuit tin. The latest attack comes via the boot of the debutant Mirallas who sweeps a shot just past the post of Harper's net. Harper would probably have preferred an easier comeback than this.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>21 mins: 21 Minutes already! Where does it all go I ask you? Everton have a corner that comes to nothing but they manage to work an effort from it, once again via the boot of Mirallas. He plucks the ball from the air with the daintiest of touches and aims a shot goalward. Harper gets behind it and it comes to nothing. Newcastle are having an absolute shocker here, can't keep the ball, can't defend without looking nervous and can't get the ball from Everton. It could be a long night for them.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>26 mins: Finally, Newcastle get their act together and put Everton under some pressure. A long-ish free-kick is floated into the box, the ball bounces about a bit and lands at the foot of Ciss\u00e9. He smacks it across the goal but it goes wide of Howard's post. Still, it's something.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>26 mins: Arran Ridley is worried, and so he should be as a Newcastle fan. Here he is explaining just why he is worried. </p> <blockquote> <p>I'm not sure what is more worrying as a Newcastle fan - the ineptitude of our performance so far or the fact that Gary Neville judging from his pre-match analysis seemed to have prepared better for this game in terms of tactical analysis than Newcastle have done.</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm going to plump for the ineptitude option. Anita has picked up a yellow by the way.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>30 mins: Everton are having it so easy that even Jagielka looks like scoring (he hasn't scored for over a year me thinks). His shot from outside the box skims the outside of the post and the camera pans to Harper's face. He puffs out his cheeks. He knew he was beaten.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>32 mins: The first mention of Cabaye by the Sky lads. Deary me. Ben Arfa ain't done much either.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>34 mins: Ryan \"I watch Keeping Up With Kardashians\" Dunne has done the email thing. Here's his words: </p> <blockquote> <p>I have one eye on your MBM and the other on Keeping Up With Kardashians, for a doubly entertaining experience! Re: Saved by the Bell. It was no Dawson's Creek style quality drama, true, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bflYjF90t7c\">this</a> is surely the My Name is Joe of caffeine addiction.</p> </blockquote> <p>I must confess I don't remember this scene despite the Bell being one of my absolute favourites when I was a nipper. That and Mask.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>36 mins: Anita, he of the earlier yellow card, has almost drawn Newcastle level but his shot is cleared off the line by Baines who is everywhere tonight.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>38 mins: For those asking, the episode I watched was the final one when they are in high school and Jessie and AC Slater are organising the final dance \u2013 do the kids still call it a dance? \u2013 and Zac is trying to get back with Kelly. Did you know they also made a Saved By the Bell movie? A MOVIE! Has anyone seen this?</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>40 mins: Newcastle and Pardew are going to have do something at half-time because if it keeps on like this they haven't even a sliver of a hope. And just as I say that, Pienaar robs the ball just outside the box from Perch, he cuts inside to the box, Osman is in acres, acres!, but Pienaar goes for himself and curls it wide. Osman looks furious and he has every right to be.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>42 mins: It's all a bit too much for Jelavic, who never really recovered from that earlier knock against the post. He goes off, an arm around the trainer, and Anichebe comes on in his place.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>Half-time: Three minutes of added on time come to nothing and Newcastle go into the break a goal down. It could, and should, have been a lot more for David Moyes' side but he will be happy enough with that performance. The half-time question comes courtesy of Paul Kerton. He says: </p> <blockquote> <p>I know Everton have started this season well but what has happened to Newcastle? They have imploded. Last year they could do no wrong. This year they can do no right.</p> </blockquote> <p>Anyone got a theory why? I reckon heads were turned but whatdoiknow? But there is also the Tiot\u00e9 shaped hole in front of the back four. that bit of bite he provides would gone down a storm in this match</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>9.00pm: Here's Matt Bridle's response to the half-time question: </p> <blockquote> <p>Pardew said he wanted us to be in tough in midfield, but we're getting picked out on the wings as a result. We are really really missing Tiote to free Cabaye up to pick passes. Also Marveaux needs to go. He's done nothing. </p> </blockquote> <p>Spot. On.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>9.01pm: Back to the Saved by the Bell riff. Chris Brown, presumably not <em>that</em> Chris Brown, has this to say.</p> <blockquote> <p> I'm sure I'm not the first person to bring mention this [You are actually], but they actually made TWO Saved by the Bell movies, one where they go to Kelly's grandpa's hotel in Hawaii, the second where Zack and Kelly get married in Vegas. Yes I've seen both. No, I'm not ashamed to admit it. </p> </blockquote> <p>Two? Two! That is my day off taken care off.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>45 mins: Peeeeeeeeeeep! And we are back. Already, there is some good news for Newcastle fans. Marveaux is off and Ba is on. In tactical things, Perch has gone to the middle and Anita has gone to right back.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p>46 mins: And we are back to more of the same from Everton. Pretty passing, controlling the tempo and attacking at will.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>49 mins: <strong>Goallll! Everton 1-1 Newcastle (Ba, 49) </strong> Where on earth did that come from? My word. Cabaye, who was nowhere in the first half, robs the ball in the midfield, strides forward and plays the most sumptuous of passes into the path of Ba. He eases it past Howard with a first-time swish of his boot and it is game on. Pardew jumps from his seat and celebrates.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>53 mins: Newcastle are back in this now and, all of a sudden, Everton look a bit shell-shocked. The contrast between these two sides from the previous half is startling, startling I tell you. Whatever Pardew said at half-time has got his side all fired up.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>57 mins: Newcastle have their first corner of the game. It comes to nothing. David Moyes is standing on the touchline, hands on hips, and looking like he is going to nut the first person who looks at him the wrong way. That expression does not chance after some nice work by Baines down the left that, like the Newcastle corner, comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p>59 mins: <strong>Goalllllllll! </strong>No, again, I am pulling your leg. The ball is played into the Newcastle box \u2013 I missed by who I must confess \u2013 and Fellaini helps it home. Thinking he has put Everton into the lead once again, he celebrates. That celebration is short-lived however as the linesman's flag is pointing in a direction that no Everton fans wants it to be.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>61 mins: No isn't that nice and all in the spirit of the Olympics and all that jazz? Anichebe and Harper go for the ball in the box and the referee pulls the Everton forward up for a referee but Harper tells the ref that Anichebe was just going for the ball. *Wipes away tear*</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p>66 mins: David Moyes watch. He is getting angrier. And angrier. Saved By the Bell Watch (courtesy of Matt Dony):</p> <blockquote> <p>Saved By The Bell was, indeed, awesome, but does anyone else remember how insane some of the early details were? Zac had a remote controlled, life size cut out of Kelly in his bedroom that dropped out of the ceiling, Screech had a robot, it was as if they weren't entirely sure what sort of show it was going to be.</p> </blockquote> <p>Who doesn't have a life-size cut out of Kelly in their bedroom?</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p>68 mins: Ooooooooooooh. Harper sprints out of his net, hoofs the ball as hard as he can and the ball lands at the feet of Ba. He is tracked by Distin who does well to ensure that the Newcastle striker does not get his shot off. One for the purists this.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p>72 mins: Speaking of life-size cut outs, I once sent my mum an Elvis one from Memphis. He was wearing a black, diamond encrusted jumpsuit. She left it in the kitchen and every morning I would come down, see it in the corner of my eye and jump out of my skin.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p>74 mins: Some excellent play from Fellaini down the left finds Pienaar near the corner of the box. He looks up and finds Osman who shoots first time but puts the ball the wrong side of the post.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p>78 mins: Santon gives Anichebe the smallest of nudges half way down the right hand side and gives away a needless free-kick. The ball is swung in by Hibbert and Jagielka heads the ball across to box to be met by the head of Anichebe who powers the ball at least a foot over the line. But the goal isn't given! While the Everton players complain, Ben Arfa breaks and is bearing down on goal but the referee, inexplicably, calls him back. Two very poor decisions there.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p>79 mins: That is two goals for Everton that should have stood in this half. Moyes will not be getting any happier.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p>84 mins: Things are getting tasty now. Feet are being left in. Words are being said. And yellows are being awarded. Fellaini is now the proud owner of one such card. So too is Shola Ameobi who came on as a sub for Ba just after all that furore.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p>88 mins: <strong>Goallllllllll! Everton 2-1 Newcastle (Anichebe, 88)</strong> That is no more than Everton deserved really. Pienaar plays the ball into the feet of Anichebe who turns like your average tutu-ed ballerina and fires the ball into the Newcastle net. That is game over ... oh no it isn't ...</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p>90 mins: <strong>Goallllllllll! Everton 2-2 Newcastle (Ba, 90)</strong> ... because Ba has got his second of the night. A lovely punt from up the field from Williamson is chested down wonderfully by Ameobi on the edge of the box and Ba just rolls the ball under the on rushing Howard and into the net.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p>Full time: Despite the four added-on minutes, there is not much to report. It ends all-square. There is a smattering of boos at the end which must be aimed at the referee for what was some poor decision making in the second half. That's it from me folks. Thanks for all your emails and Saved By the Bell chat. Have a nice night.</p>",
  "<p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were said to be \"profoundly shocked and troubled\" by the topless photographs of the duchess taken while they were on holiday in France, a French court has heard.</p> <p>It was, their lawyer said, a shocking breach of their \"personal intimacy\" that the photographs were taken of them in a private place and published on the front cover of a French magazine. And he reminded the court that the pictures of the young couple were taken almost 15 years to the day since the \"cynical, morbid and useless\" chase that led to the death of the duke's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.</p> <p>The legal clashes in France between lawyers for the royal couple and the magazine that published the photographs came as the fallout from the scandal resulted in the suspension of the editor of an Irish tabloid newspaper, which also printed the images.</p> <p>Michael O'Kane was suspended while an internal investigation is carried out into the decision to run the images in the Irish Daily Star, which is co-owned by media baron Richard Desmond's Northern and Shell group and the Irish-based Independent News and Media, and has been under threat of closure since publishing the pictures.</p> <p>The country's justice minister said he would revisit privacy legislation, a move that could spell the death knell for the days of self-regulation of newspapers in&#xa0;Ireland.</p> <p>In a strongly worded statement on Monday afternoon, Alan Shatter said he was going to return to Ireland's 2006 Privacy Act to \"consider what changes should be made\" and then \"progress its enactment\". He added that despite the existence of a press regulator \"some sections of the print media are either unable or unwilling in their reportage to distinguish between 'prurient interest' and 'the public interest'\".</p> <p>The threat is a blow to the Irish newspaper industry, which battled to stave off statutory regulation in 2003 and in the end successfully negotiated with the government to set up a regulatory system based around the independent Irish press council and a press ombudsman. Appearing for the royal couple, lawyer Aur\u00e9lien Hamelle told the court at Nanterre in the Paris suburbs that he was acting for William Arthur Mountbatten Windsor and his wife, Catherine Middleton.</p> <p>He described the photographs as portraying the \"profoundly intimate life of the couple\", and asked: \"In what name did this magazine publish these shocking photos \u2026 It was certainly not in the name of information. This has no place on the cover of a magazine or even in an article in a magazine.\"</p> <p>He said that the couple \"had not consented to and had absolutely no knowledge that the photographs were being taken.</p> <p>\"It was a holiday place, a private house, and the duke and duchess had a right to be there out of the public eye. They could not be seen by the naked eye by someone passing, they could only be seen by a [camera] lens, and that is the problem.</p> <p>\"The photographs were taken on 5 September 2012, which was, give or take, six days, the 15th anniversary of the cynical, morbid and useless chase that led to the death of Prince William's mother.\"</p> <p>Hamelle showed anger as he described how Closer magazine had crowed about its \"scoop\" and had been publicly proud of it. He said the magazine editor had even tweeted: \"Catherine Middleton as you have never seen her and you will never see her again.\"</p> <p>\"They [Closer] were aware of the illegal character of the photos. The knew how the princess and Prince William would react to having their intimacy violated.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The magazine said it's an ordinary scene and millions of women every day go on beaches wearing only their bikini bottoms. They say this is a woman's liberty. To impose this on a woman who did not want it is not progress or a sign of modernity. It's a regression and profoundly shocking.\"</p> <p>He said the couple was seeking an injunction preventing Closer magazine from printing any more copies of the offending issue, to remove the photographs from its website and not to distribute the photographs to any other publications.</p> <p>He also demanded that the magazine hand over the electronic files for the original photos. He said they were not seeking to have the magazine withdrawn from kiosks and newsagents because it was \"too late\".</p> <p>Delphine Pando, defending Closer magazine, said the storm was a \"disproportionate response\" to the publication of the photographs. She said the magazine had not publicised the edition. \"There was no television campaign, there was no poster campaign, there was not a single press release. Not one.\" She said it was the royal couple who brought it to the headlines.</p> <p>\"The damage came from the direct declaration of the couple. It's because of that all these journalists are here.\"</p> <p>She said that the royal couple was clearly convinced they were \"sheltered from prying eyes\" at their holiday residence owned by Viscount Linley, but she insisted: \"They were clearly visible from the road\".Showing the three judges a copy of the Daily Mail, she added: \"It is incontestable that the scene was visible from the road and this has caused a debate in England over security.\"</p> <p>She said Closer had no intention of republishing the photographs but the magazine had no control over the agency which had them and the asked the judge to throw out the case.</p> <p>When she had finished, Hamelle leapt to his feet, clearly very angry, and said: \"It is scandalous to suggest that this couple was responsible for the damage caused. Where is the morality in that?</p> <p>\"We and Closer obviously don't have the same values.\"</p> <p>The duke and duchess have asked for the injunction order to be accompanied by a warning that the magazine would be fined \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,000) for every day that it did not comply with an injunction and fined \u20ac100,000 if it tried to resell the photographs. The judges will rule on the case on Tuesday at lunchtime.</p> <p>The couple have launched a separate criminal lawsuit in France for violation of their privacy.</p>",
  "<p>During the press conference of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, Professor Phil Scraton said he and fellow panellists had the advantage over any public inquiry, that in their meticulous investigation of the massive documentation they had been greatly assisted by being \"able to get close to the victims\". This comment was no doubt prompted by the traditional lawyer's assumption that a public inquiry is limited to listening to voices inside the inquiry forum, by formal legal processes from which the independent panel was spared.</p> <p>The contrast in procedures is not accurate. When Lord Scarman conducted his inquiry in 1981 into the Brixton riots under the terms of the Police Act 1964, it was a notable feature of the inquiry that at the end of each day's session of hearing witnesses Lord Scarman could be seen walking the streets of Brixton talking to residents about their experiences during the riots. No one, as far as I know, raised any objections; nor could they reasonably have done so. I&#xa0;am quite certain, moreover, that Lord Scarman's report was better informed as a result of those informal conversations.</p> <p>Public inquiries are not aspects of the legal system. They are a part of public administration designed to investigate national scandals or disasters and to report to ministers who bear the responsibility for deciding what action, if any, needs to be taken.<br><strong>Louis Blom-Cooper QC</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Simon Jenkins' article on police accountability is astonishingly perverse, (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/hillsborough-scandal-last-23-years\" title=\"\">Hillsborough shows it's time for elected commissioners</a>, 14 September). In South Yorkshire at the time, the nearest thing to an individual politician with responsibility was Sir Irvine Patnick, local MP and former member of the Sheffield city council, and he completely swallowed the whole police story.</p> <p>Those who have served on police authorities know how powerful the pressures are to support the police line. Accusations of failure to back law and order are invariably used and a single individual, whether directly elected or not, would be more susceptible to such pressure. There are few votes in being portrayed as \"soft\".</p> <p>My experience on the West Yorkshire police committee at the time of the Yorkshire Ripper case convinced me that it requires informed political pluralism to deal with the inevitable pressure.</p> <p>Jenkins was once the leading advocate of \"big bang localism\" and I am disappointed that he has now succumbed to the populist idea of the single \"tough guy\", which will inevitably undermine local democracy still further.<br><strong>Michael Meadowcroft</strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The shocking revelations contained in the Hillsborough Independent Panel's report into the 1989 tragedy underline the need for the Independent Police Complaints Commission to be given new powers. If the IPCC were able to interview officers under caution immediately following incidents, cover-ups might be prevented. The absence of such powers has hindered the ability of the police to properly investigate many high-profile cases in London.</p> <p>We have seen too many instances of officers distorting the facts by comparing notes in draft form and co-ordinating statements to fit their chosen narrative, as in the Jean Charles de Menezes case. These practices are illegal and must stop. The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime should take the lead by ensuring there is proper oversight of Metropolitan police officers who are required to provide statements individually and not as a collective entity.<br><strong>Jenny Jones</strong><br><em>Green party group leader, London&#xa0;Assembly</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Robert Younger (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/13/danger-caught-in-a-crowd\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 13 September) is wrong to blame fans for the perceived need to construct fences around the pitch at football grounds. In the early and middle years of the 20th century large crowds were common and, in the case of an emergency, often spilled on to the pitch, thus preventing serious injury. The introduction of \"pens\" and high fences in the 80s was an indication of an authoritarian mindset that sought to treat fans as farmyard animals or prisoners. Huge mistakes were made on the day of the Hillsborough tragedy, but it was an accident waiting to happen. <br><strong>Peter Smith</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",
  "<p>Since the announcement of the Wii U launch date and price last week, everyone has had an opinion on the next console from Nintendo. Today, the Sun effectively wrote the machine off as outdated and overpriced \u2013 but what do developers think?</p> <p>Firebrand Games is a Scottish developer specialising in racing titles. Having produced conversions of titles such as Need For Speed and Trackmania, it is currently working on an unannounced multi-platform title, which will appear on Wii U. We got some questions to creative director Peter Shea about the machine and what it may offer in the year to come.<br><br><strong>So, having worked with it, what do you think of the Wii U technology? Are there aspects and possibilities that aren't really being mentioned right now?</strong><br>The Wii U technology is certainly interesting and unique in many ways. People in the gaming press have become very focussed on its power at the expense of its most unique aspect, the DRC controller. I've heard conflicting comments in the media on the Wii U capabilities, some more accurate than others, but suffice to say it's running our multi-platform HD game just fine. As with all new consoles it's too early to say just how far people will be able to push it once they get to grips with the hardware and work out the best way to make things for it, so it's unlikely you'll see any astonishing titles in the first year or so \u2013 but they will come. The differences in power and graphical fidelity are going to become much harder to distinguish in the coming years and this should hopefully bring about greater focus on gameplay and experience \u2013 something Nintendo have always excelled at.</p> <p><strong>So you think the most interesting possibilities of the hardware won't be realised for a while?</strong> <br>There is still a degree of uncertainty about exactly what you can, should and must do with the Wii U, almost as if Nintendo is still working this out for itself, or not quite ready to show all its cards. Even though we have the hardware in house, we won't really know what it's all about until we see the first wave of first Party Titles, and see and play what Nintendo have been working on. </p> <p>It definitely has a lot of scope for experimentation. The combination of a second viewport on handheld screen, very accurate gyroscopes and accelerometers, and front and back cameras seems to offer a lot of possibilities \u2013 and you're seeing some of the more obvious ideas already in titles like ZombiU. The Controller itself is light, nice to hold and has a great display on it \u2013 it feels impressive and natural in the hand; once you hold it and play with it, it does make sense \u2013 perhaps not in the revolutionary way Wii Remote made sense, but it is intriguing nonetheless.<br> <br><strong>What most interests you as a developer?</strong><br>Even though it might not apply to the games Firebrand are working on right now, I'm most interested in the possibilities the Controller offers. The idea of local multiplayer with different viewpoints is exciting as is the scope for co-operative or asynchronous tactical play or just for combining regular control with touch screen input with motion control and even potentially with AR or near field communications. </p> <p>I think games that manage to use or bring these things together in ways beyond the gimmicks we saw in some early Wii products stand the best chance of offering compelling experiences not available on any other platform. I do remember similar optimism around the potential of the Wii when it launched, however, and this was never really fulfilled the way perhaps some people imagined. What's also not entirely clear is just how games can make use of two screens simultaneously, but also allow for players to play on DRC alone with the TV off. Again, we are waiting to see exactly what Nintendo does here and what it expects or encourages others to do.<br> <br><strong>What is the biggest challenge for Nintendo in making Wii U a success?</strong><br>I think there are two main challenges. The first is getting the message across that this is more than \"just\" a Wii with better graphics and HD output. I think there is a danger here of the message getting confused, especially to the casual market. Nintendo needs to charm the mass market in the same way it charmed people so successfully with the Wii. You could almost argue that the unprecedented success of the Wii makes it almost impossible for Nintendo to compete with its successor. I do believe that with the right titles, the right price and Nintendo's excellent marketing they can do this but I expect it to be the focus of next year \u2013 Christmas 2013 \u2013 rather than at launch or in the coming months.<br> <br>The second big challenge is selling the machine to Gamers who already own one or more HD consoles, and handheld devices and smartphones capable of gaming. I don't entirely subscribe to the view that Apple and Android are Nintendo's biggest rivals from here as I think the different devices will always offer different experiences and there is still high demand for both those experiences at differing price points, be it \u00a340 or 69p, even in a recession. The traditional markets we have grown up with are definitely in a state of flux but to me that doesn't mean there isn't scope for at least one more generation of traditional gaming device under the telly.</p> <p><strong>And presumably first-party software will be vital...</strong><br>Nintendo is still among the best game developers in the world, and you can only play Nintendo games on Nintendo consoles \u2013 as much as the market changes these facts remain. People still need Nintendo, its popularity has not waned despite the growth of new devices, platforms and franchises \u2013 it's bigger than ever.<br> <br>It's this fact alone that makes me optimistic for the Wii U despite the difficult times and the ever changing market. The majority of the game development community wrote off the DS before launch and almost everyone wrote off the Wii on first look too \u2013 both went on to be extraordinarily successful. The lesson is clear: never underestimate Nintendo!</p>",
  "<p>I know from bitter experience that appearances can be deceptive. I taught in a school, high in the league tables, which had seemed great when I visited: quiet classes and happy staff.

Her murder led to one of the greatest judicial scandals of the last half century and the largest ever trial of British police officers, yet the story has still to reach a&#xa0;just and final conclusion.</p> <p>This month, the first of a series of official reports into the case is due to be published, and there is a new book by freelance journalist Satish Sekar, who has done more than anyone to bring to light the nature of a miscarriage of justice that ranks alongside those of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1991/mar/15/northernireland.davidpallister\" title=\"Birmingham Six\">Birmingham Six</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/10/northernireland.northernireland\" title=\"Guildford Four\">Guildford Four</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/bridgewater-three-to-go-free-1279695.html\" title=\"Bridgewater Three\">Bridgewater Three</a>.</p> <p>It was on Valentine's Day in 1988 that White, a 20-year-old sex worker, was found with her throat slit and more than 50 stab wounds. Initially, a search was launched for a dark-haired white man seen leaving the scene. Five young men, none of them white, were arrested and charged with her murder: Tony Paris, Yusef Abdullahi, Stephen Miller (White's boyfriend), and John and Ronnie Actie. In 1990, the first three were convicted and jailed for life and the Acties acquitted; thus the case is sometimes known as the Cardiff Three and sometimes the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Lynette_White\" title=\"Cardiff Five\">Cardiff Five</a>. Part of the evidence against them came from two other sex workers, Leanne Vilday and Angela Psaila, and a neighbour of White's, Mark Grommek.</p> <p>Two years later, following a major campaign, the three were cleared on appeal, although they still had to contend with murmurings that they might have been involved. Delivering the judgment in the court of appeal, Lord Chief Justice Taylor said of the interrogation of Miller that \"short of physical violence, it is hard to conceive of a more hostile and intimidating approach by officers to a suspect\". Michael Mansfield QC, who represented Miller, said that the recordings of the interrogation \"left an indelible impression on my memory \u2026 I took the trouble to count the number of times <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1992/dec/10/cardiff-three-wales\" title=\"Miller protested his innocence\">Miller protested his innocence</a>: over 300.\"</p> <p>A painstaking and exemplary reinvestigation of the case was eventually undertaken in 1999 under Detective Superintendent Kevin O'Neill. Developments in DNA techniques led detectives to search for a suspect whom they were to nickname Cellophane Man, because a crucial DNA trace was found on a blood-stained piece of cellophane at the crime scene. This took them to a 37-year-old security guard called Jeffrey Gafoor, from Llanharan, near Bridgend, who had received only one conviction in the intervening years, for attacking a colleague with a brick.</p> <p>Gafoor, once he realised he was a suspect, took an overdose of paracetamol but the police, who had him under surveillance, broke into his home and saved his life. In hospital, he&#xa0;told police: \"I would rather not die. I would rather face the music but I was looking forward to death to find out if God exists or the devil.\" He claimed he had had an argument with White over the \u00a330 she was charging him and a fight had developed. Faced with the overwhelming evidence against him, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/13/cardiff-three-innocent-lynette-white\" title=\"Gafoor pleaded guilty at Cardiff crown court in 2003\">Gafoor pleaded guilty at Cardiff crown court in 2003</a> and was jailed for life, albeit, as Sekar points out, with a shorter tariff than the one originally set for the three innocent men.</p> <p>Prosecution witnesses Vilday, Psaila and Grommek were charged with perjury. During their trial in 2008, they claimed they had been harassed into lying by the police. The judge, Mr Justice Maddison, accepted that \"you were seriously hounded, bullied, threatened, abused and manipulated by the police \u2026 as a result of which you felt compelled to agree to false accounts they suggested to you\". He added that what they had been subjected to was \"unacceptable in a civilised society\" but jailed them for 18&#xa0;months.</p> <p>Finally, in 2009, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/04/cardiff-three-police-charges\" title=\"13 former and serving South Wales police officers\">13 former and serving South Wales police officers</a> were charged in connection with the case. Eight of them, and two civilians, stood trial last year at Swansea crown court; a further trial of the others was due to follow this year. All pleaded not guilty. In December last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/01/largest-trial-police-officers-collapses\" title=\"the trial was dramatically halted by the judge\">the trial was dramatically halted by the judge</a>, Mr Justice Sweeney. It was said that documents essential to the case, which should have been disclosed to the defence, had been destroyed. \"When a trial has become irredeemably unfair,\" said the judge, \"it must stop.\" The defendants, including those yet to stand trial, were&#xa0;formally declared not guilty.</p> <p>Amazingly, not long after the abandonment of the trial, it emerged that the documents had not been destroyed at all. Two inquiries have been launched. The first, being carried out by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into what happened to the documents, is due to report shortly. The IPCC commissioner, Sarah Green, described this as \"a very tightly focused investigation that concentrates on events regarding the alleged destruction of IPCC documents \u2026 We are not investigating the reasons for the collapse of the trial, which is a matter for the director of public prosecutions (Keir Starmer).\"</p> <p>This parallel inquiry, being carried out under Michael Fuller, of the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, has a remit to establish \"whether the prosecution team (CPS and counsel) approached, prepared and managed disclosure in this case effectively, bearing in mind the history, size and complexity of the investigation and prosecution\". Fuller, a former chief constable of Kent and the first black officer to reach that rank, said that \"it is important that the public can have confidence in the way the CPS conducts its cases\". The results of that inspection are not expected until later in the autumn.</p> <p>Sekar, who is 48, a Thames polytechnic (now the university of Greenwich) sociology BA from Greenford in west London, became involved in the case from the start, when he was embarking on a career as a researcher and journalist. \"I had read an article about it in the bulletin of the Institute of Race Relations and got in touch with them. They put me on to Malik Abdullahi, Yusef's brother, and I went down to Cardiff to meet him and others who knew the five. I found them very open and honest and I was soon convinced that the five were innocent. I had no idea that I would still be involved in the case 20 years later.\"</p> <p>In 1991, as part of the Guardian's Justice on Trial series, which had just been launched, we wrote of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1991/mar/20/cardiff-three\" title=\"major discrepancies in the prosecution of the five\">major discrepancies in the prosecution of the five</a>. Sekar has doggedly followed the case since then, and his book, The Cardiff Five: Innocent Beyond Any Doubt, was launched in the House of Commons earlier this month. \"This case simply refused to go away,\" he says of his commitment to covering it.</p> <p>One very powerful section of the book is the evidence of Professor David Barclay, who was head of physical evidence at the National Crime and Operations Faculty at the time of the reinvestigation. He states: \"it was inconceivable that multiple offenders were involved \u2026 not one of the six or seven people who must, on the police's version, have been milling about in the darkened flat, had trodden in her blood and left bloody footprints\". He asks: \"How could this very clear scientific picture have become so distorted that the prosecution was able to persuade a jury that the scientific findings supported an entirely mythical and scientifically ludicrous version of events?\"</p> <p>Sekar is now in favour of a complete national database that contains the DNA of every citizen: \"I used to oppose such a database passionately, but the hunt for Cellophane Man helped to change my mind.\" Such a database would, he believes, have led swiftly to&#xa0;Gafoor.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/25/yusef-abdullahi-cardiff-three-dies\" title=\"Yusef Abdullahi died last year\">Yusef Abdullahi died last year</a>, aged 49, of a burst ulcer and Ronnie Actie died in 2007. There could well have been further tragedies: after the original trial, Lynette White's angry father, the late Terry White, confronted the acquitted John Actie with a gun and could well have killed an innocent man, as he had believed the false case against him. While the wrongly arrested have been paid compensation for their conviction, they were all anxious to see justice done at the abandoned trial. An estimated \u00a330m to \u00a340m has been spent on the original bungled investigation and the subsequent failed prosecution of the police.</p> <p>Sekar is extremely sceptical about what will emerge from the reports, and whether the case of the Cardiff Five will ever be properly resolved. Although the stain of a shameful miscarriage of justice will remain with the South Wales police, so far, the only people to have been punished for what happened are two vulnerable sex workers and a neighbour of the dead woman bullied into giving false evidence.</p> <p>\u2022 The Cardiff Five: Innocent Beyond Any Doubt by Satish Sekar is published by Waterside Press.

  "<p>The very name Les Ebdon \u2013 which sounds as if it belongs to a militant trade union leader or northern comedian \u2013 seems to provoke Tory backbenchers, public school heads and Oxbridge academics. They should relax. Whatever his ambitions, the new director of the Office for Fair Access can do little to compel the ancient universities to admit more students from comprehensives. The few powers he has \u2013 to fine universities or impose cuts in fees \u2013 are politically impossible to use. The universities say that they don't get enough applications from pupils at maintained schools; and those they do get often have the wrong A-level grades in the wrong subjects. We shall, therefore, see more of the same: summer schools, college open days, and pleas to teachers to cultivate \"aspiration\".</p> <p>None of this will ever be enough. As Ebdon himself says, millions of ordinary families believe Oxford and Cambridge \"are not for the likes of us\". Unfortunately, they are right. A third of all admissions to Oxbridge go to just 100 schools. Eton and Westminster each send around 100 pupils to Oxford or Cambridge every year. Those students already know many of their fellow undergraduates and can share in-jokes, catchphrases, memories and social contacts. They feel instantly at home in Oxbridge colleges which look like their schools. Their teaching was specifically geared to Oxbridge requirements. It is hardly surprising that 18-year-olds from northern comprehensives fear being out of place. College open days, where they get first-hand experience of the Oxbridge social mix, may even accentuate their concerns. The peer group \u2013 and a sense of who belongs on which territory \u2013 is of paramount importance to an 18-year-old. It explains why, in the inner-city, so many join gangs. Elite universities provide territory for gangs formed in public schools.</p> <p>Attempts to widen Oxbridge entry face a chicken-and-egg conundrum. Oxbridge says it can't recruit more from the state sector until schools send them more highly qualified pupils. The schools say the pupils won't go \u2013 or won't aspire to go \u2013 until the universities appear less exclusive. Bold measures are needed to break this impasse.</p> <p>Suppose Oxford and Cambridge were to ask every state school to identify, at 15, its brightest pupils academically (one, two or three, depending on size). Suppose those pupils were given every possible support and guidance in A-level subject choice and teaching. Suppose they were invited annually to week-long summer schools where they could form their own peer networks of solidarity and support. Suppose, above all, Oxbridge allocated to this pool of talent a fixed proportion of its places \u2013 initially, perhaps, 70%, but rising to over 90%, so that its UK intake became representative of the general school population \u2013 with those who did best at A-level getting preference. Would academic standards collapse? Would Oxford and Cambridge lose their positions as \"world-class\" universities? Surely not. Several research studies show that, on average, students from maintained schools perform better in degree exams than their fee-charging-school counterparts with the same A-level grades. What we do not know \u2013 because they never get the chance \u2013 is how well those with lower A-level grades would perform. But it is possible that, given incentives and support, most of those selected would achieve top grades in any case. Those not selected, along with pupils from fee-charging schools, would compete for the remaining places or simply apply to any of the other 100-odd UK universities, some of which are quite good.</p> <p>Since pupils' home background would be irrelevant \u2013 there would be nothing to stop the middle-classes gaming the system as usual \u2013 this cannot be described as social engineering. It would be educational engineering. Oxford and Cambridge would have access to wider and more diverse talent. The chief incentive for parents to send their children to fee-charging schools \u2013 that they maximise chances of Oxbridge entry \u2013 would disappear overnight. Middle-class parents would clamour to get their children into comprehensives in disadvantaged areas in hope of them grabbing one of those precious places. The influx of more aspirational families would raise standards more effectively than anything governments have done in the past 30 years.</p> <p>And as a welcome by-product, Britain would be free at last of one of its chief sources of social division.</p> <p>\u2022 Mike Baker is unwell.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, a man of endless accommodation, drew a hard line under the one thing he could <em>not</em> do to save the US economy. Bernanke told the press:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If the 'fiscal cliff' isn't addressed \u2026 I don't think our tools are strong enough to offset the effects of a major fiscal shock.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The warning was clear: a \"fiscal cliff\" could cause the Lehman moment of all Lehman moments. It didn't even send a ripple through Washington. Congress went on campaigning and strategizing over election-year politics. They've heard it before. Nothing will be done until after the election. And when something is done, it will be done at the last minute, in the latest custom of these economic disputes. </p> <p>An election season, a weak economy, and trouble in Europe have conspired to create a lot of fear, but not a lot of action. The only question: to add up what the damage could be if Congress doesn't ask. </p> <p>To understand the danger we may \u2013 or may not \u2013 be in, it's worth recapping exactly what the fiscal cliff is. The fiscal cliff is a problem of Congress's own making, which is not to say it will be one of Congress's solving. </p> <p>In 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control Act. It was the seed of what we now call the fiscal cliff. Here's what to expect: shortly after 1 January, unless Congress intervenes beforehand, we'll see two things happen: $100bn of automatic spending cuts, along with the demise of a batch of tax cuts that have been a crutch for the weak economy \u2013 the Bush-era tax cuts that have kept taxes low for eight years; and Obama's 2% payroll-tax holiday.</p> <p>Each of these separately \u2013 tax hikes or spending cuts \u2013 would not be enough to dent the US economy by much. But together, the spending cuts and the tax hikes are enormous. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Congressional Budget Office both expect that a recession would immediately follow if Congress does not address the fiscal cliff.</p> <p>The spending cuts, for instance, will add up to $100bn pulled out of the economy by the government, in everything from the defense budget to Medicare. The idea is to reduce the federal deficit by $1tn over 10 years. The tax hikes will return tax rates to what they were before 2003, which means the top tax rate for households could be over 39%, according to press reports.</p> <p>There are two tricky things about fixing this particular problem. The first is the politics. Everyone in Congress knows this will be a hard-fought battle, and they're happy to put it off. </p> <p>The other tricky aspect is this: it's been an uphill battle to convince lawmakers that the issue is not just pressing, but real. After all, the benefit of the spending cuts is tangible: the CBO predicts that the US deficit, after the tax cuts, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43539\">would be only $650bn</a>, compared to $1.1tn now.</p> <p>And the spending cuts all seem manageable. The biggest set of cuts will be to defense, to the tune of $54.7bn per year. These are peripheral to much of the real economy. The other spending cuts will be modest in size \u2013 8% for domestic programs such as Head Start and 2% for Medicare's support to doctors. </p> <p>As for the tax cuts, the only debate about those is whether to keep them for the middle class \u2013 for those making $250,000 and under \u2013 or to keep them for everybody. Republican leaders have favored the latter choice.</p> <p>Those are hits the economy can easily take, right? They may seem so, until you consider how much better things might be if it didn't have to. </p> <p>The CBO analyzed a scenario in which the Bush-era tax cuts are extended indefinitely, Medicare keeps its payments to doctors steady, and the spending cuts don't take place. The result: a deficit that looks much like the one we have now \u2013 at $1tn \u2013 but a much healthier economy, with 1.7% GDP growth by the end of 2013, and an unemployment rate at 8%, compared to its current 8.1%. (The asterisk is that the unemployment rate is currently at 8.1% because so many Americans have dropped out of the workforce.)</p> <p>But what if the question is not whether the effect of the fiscal cliff is looming over us. The question is whether it's <em>already here</em>. There's reason to believe that Congress's delay in addressing the fiscal cliff has already had a psychological effect on corporate America. </p> <p>A group of <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443991704577578993747254200.html\">economists told the Wall Street Journal that is exactly what is happening</a>: They blame our lackluster recovery this year on a pullback in spending and investment by US companies, which are afraid that the fallout from a fiscal cliff could compromise their ability to find funding or function normally. They've been preparing by essentially rolling into the fetal position in preparation. </p> <p>There is another aspect to the fiscal cliff that neither the CBO nor Congress can solve for, and it is the biggest: the effect on the financial markets. Four years after the financial meltdown of 2008, the markets are at new highs, both in stocks and bonds. The benefit of a strong stock market has been elusive to regular Americans \u2013 who need jobs rather than boisterous stock portfolios \u2013 but it has been a boon for banks and companies, which have found it easy to finance their operations.</p> <p>That shows that the markets are easy to appease with legislative policy. And even though the strong stock market may not benefit most Americans, a weak one hits them hard. It happened before, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, and also when the debt-ceiling debate last year caused turmoil in corporate America and the markets. Hell hath no fury like a stock market scorned.</p> <p>The stock market, especially, tends to \"price in\" these fears beforehand \u2013 which means that, as the fiscal cliff approaches and a congressional solution remains elusive, the market could reflect the fear of slower growth. If the market senses that politics is going to be a long-term obstacle to the growth of US companies, there could be a psychological self-reinforcing effect: the markets will show fear that the economy will suffer, which means the markets will make it harder for US companies to find financing or maintain their stock prices, which means the companies won't hire and won't spend, which means the economy will suffer. </p> <p>It is that circle, in all likelihood, that Chairman Bernanke was thinking of when he said that there was nothing the Fed could do about the fiscal cliff. The Federal Reserve can't intervene in the economy but it can intervene in the markets, and it has to an unprecedented degree over the past four years. The Federal Reserve has become the watcher and weigher of market-moving events. So, if the Fed is afraid that the fiscal cliff may cause a disruption so big that even the Fed's all-encompassing embrace of the markets can't fix it, then it's Chairman Bernanke's word \u2013 and not that of Congress \u2013 that carries the most weight. </p> <p>Most insiders expect Congress to reach an agreement on avoiding the fiscal cliff \u2026 at the last moment. That's the way lawmakers have addressed everything from the passing of the Tarp bank bailouts to the debate over raising the debt ceiling last year. But there is a cost to this last-minute thinking, and it is not Congress, but workers and companies, that have to pay the price.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Heidi Moore on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/moorehn\">@moorehn</a></p> <p><em>Heidi Moore reports for <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/\">American Public Media's Marketplace</a></em></p>",
  "<p>As Britain's tabloids close ranks in condemning the publication of pictures of a sunbathing Duchess of Cambridge, it is tempting to conclude that a fear of Leveson lies behind the outbreak of criticism. But in truth anybody who has followed the history of celebrity holiday pictures will know the tabloids are far more cautious than they used to be, after a series of PR disasters and adverse legal rulings have forced privacy issues up the agenda.</p> <p>It was the Sun that in 1999 published a \"saucy, but harmless\" picture of Sophie Rhys-Jones on its front page under the unambiguous headline 'Sophie Topless', only to print a lengthy and grovelling apology the next day.</p> <p>Two years later, the People, then edited by Neil Wallis, published pictures of 'DJ Sara Cox in the Nude!' and what it described as \"two of her greatest hits\" \u2013 pictures taken without the consent of the BBC Radio 1 DJ when she was on honeymoon in the Seychelles.</p> <p>Cox said the images \"ruined all memories of my honeymoon for the rest of my life\" and she received a landmark \u00a330,000 payment following legal action. That ruling has largely set the tone since; in effect such explicit pictures are now banned by the British press. For example, a year or so before its closure, the News of the World considered whether to publish pictures of a topless Jennifer Anniston, but concluded after consulting with the Press Complaints Commission that it was not worth doing so because the images had clearly been taken without consent.</p> <p>It is this notion of consent that lies at the heart of the thinking of tabloid editors and picture desks today: drawing a distinction between long-lens paparazzi pictures and those published every weekday at close range on page three of the Sun or the Daily Star.</p> <p>At the same time, there is little economic or reputational advantage to publishing intrusive pictures in the hope of greater sales; today's publishing model is better illustrated by the success of Mail Online \u2013 in an era of photographic plenty there are more than enough pictures tweeted by pseudo-celebrities in their bikinis or wardrobe malfunctions on red carpets to keep readers of the right column \"sidebar of shame\" clicking away.</p> <p>Tabloid publishers, and those close to them, have preferred to emphasise that the Duchess pictures furore illustrates the complexity of attempting to regulate the press, because magazines and newspapers operating abroad went ahead and published the images, which were taken in the south of France.</p> <p>But nobody expects that to weigh with Lord Justice Leveson, who is preparing his final report for David Cameron, and who has chosen to focus on the subjects of news stories, to redress grievance or inaccuracy and has little interest in getting involved with the intricacies of whether it is possible to restrain dissemination of controversial images online.</p> <p>It will be of much greater concern to see that Ireland, whose system of press regulation had been held up as a model that Britain should follow, has threatened to abandon self-regulation in favour of a full-blown privacy law.</p> <p>In France there is already such a law, but it did not act to restrain the Berlusconi family's Closer. The magazine published the pictures of the duchess, taking the calculated risk that in doing so it would at worst escape with a manageable fine.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;This article was amended on 19 September 2012 to clarify that Sara Cox received a \u00a330,000 payment from the People, not a \u00a350,000 payment as originally stated</p>",
  "<p>If money talks, the latest dispute to impinge on the Heineken Cup will be settled quickly. When the stakeholders of the tournament's organisers, European Rugby Cup Ltd, gather in Dublin on Tuesday they will be given a choice by Premiership Rugby. Do they want a new television deal with Sky worth \u00a370m over four years from the 2014-15 season, or would they be prepared to give the rights for the Heineken Cup and the Amlin Challenge Cup to BT Vision and earn 50% more?</p> <p>There would be conditions, with changes to the number of teams taking part in the Heineken Cup and adjustments to the qualification process, making it more merit based than at present, and the four RaboDirect Pro12 countries will be asked to agree to the English and French clubs receiving a greater share of the money generated by sponsorship and television deals.</p> <p>\"That is only fair given that we are the two countries with by far the greatest number of chimney pots and therefore the draw cards for television,\" said the Saracens' chairman, Nigel Wray. \"But because the BT deal involves such a large injection of money, everyone will receive more and what is already a good competition will become even bigger, better and stronger.\"</p> <p>Premiership Rugby last week agreed a television deal with BT Vision worth \u00a3152m over four years. The biggest part of it, more than \u00a3100m, was for the right to televise English clubs in cross-border competition, but the ERC stakeholders will be told that BT are prepared to replace Sky as the principal broadcasters of the whole tournament.</p> <p>\"Everybody wins,\" said Wray. \"There would be so much extra money coming into the European game that we would be able to afford a third tier competition involving teams from the smaller unions. This is not a selfish bid by English and French clubs to grab everything for ourselves: all six competing nations will be better off.</p> <p>\"All we are asking for in return is fairness. Why should the team that finishes bottom of the Pro 12 automatically qualify for the Heineken Cup but clubs in England and France have to give blood to get there? Why should the Amlin Challenge Cup effectively be an Anglo-French tournament? RaboDirect teams should earn the right to be in the Heineken Cup.\"</p> <p>There is an acceptance among RaboDirect sides that qualification should be looked at. Edinburgh, Glasgow, Treviso and Zebre know they will be in the Heineken Cup even if they finish at the bottom of the league, but a Welsh region or Irish province could finish fourth and miss out.</p> <p>The Welsh regions would welcome the extra money, but their union, together with Ireland's, is happy with the qualification process because it allows international players to be regularly rested. The bulk of ERC's board is made up of representatives from unions, with only England, France and Wales having directors from participating teams.</p> <p>Premiership Rugby is going mob-handed to Dublin. In addition to its ERC director, the chief executive Mark McCafferty and the deputy chairman, Bruce Craig, Bath's owner, will be at the meeting, along with the RFU's representative, Rob Andrew. ERC itself says there can be no deal with BT because of the contract extension it has agreed with Sky, an agreement that the English and French clubs maintain is void because they had already served their notice to pull out of Europe at the end of next season.</p> <p>If one part of the battle is between the English and French clubs and the Pro12 unions, the other is between Sky, the dominant player in club rugby television in the professional era, and BT, a company with capitalisation 10 times greater than Sky's that sees sports rights as an opportunity to reclaim some of its telephone and broadband business lost to Sky and Virgin Media.</p> <p>\"Sky have been superb for sport, not just rugby,\" said Wray. \"There is now a new and very big player in the market, and competition can only be good. Television income is the lifeblood of our game and the BT deal will help all the Premiership clubs start to balance books, rather than rely on investors like me.\"</p> <p>Wray, the longest serving chairman in the Premiership, has been here before: in 1998, when the English clubs pulled out of Europe in protest at power being vested in unions, and in 2006-07 when they, along with France, served notice to withdraw unless they were given a shareholding and a measure of control in commercial matters.</p> <p>\"This is different,\" he said, \"not least because there is a huge television deal on the table. We do not want to pull out of Europe or go to court to challenge the anti-competitive IRB regulation that says clubs, which are small businesses, cannot negotiate their own television deals and there should be no need to because of what is there for everyone. Contrary to some reports, we are united and back Mark McCafferty 100 per cent. There is no reason why this should drag on and on because rugby will be the winner.\"</p>",
  "<p>Born with a rare neurological condition, 19-year-old Joe Rae has learning difficulties and problems with speech and motility.

But changes to funding for the education of young people with special needs, due to come into force next year, mean things could soon get worse.</p> <p>Under the new funding arrangements, local authorities will no longer have to \"ringfence\" funding for school leavers with high levels of need \u2013 those identified as needing financial support for their education that is likely to exceed about \u00a310,000 a year. Instead, they will have a budget for all children and young people with high levels of need up to the age of 25. There are fears in the sector that resources will not be directed where they are needed most.</p> <p>One concern is that with the compulsory participation age due to rise to 17 from next year (and 18, from 2015), giving local authorities a statutory duty to provide education for that age group means there will be \"less in the pot\" for older learners, as Alison Boulton, chief executive of the Association of National Specialist Colleges (Natspec), puts it. She is also worried that some local authorities, which, like most public sector organisations are facing considerable budget cuts, will prioritise saving money over meeting the needs of young people. She says: \"Some local authorities' attitude is 'we're not interested in the Rolls-Royce, we just want something that goes'.\"</p> <p>Typically, local authorities will offer young people like Joe three or four days of education at a local provider, often travelling by taxi or specially arranged transport.</p> <p>And as Rae found out, there can be a big difference between what parents and local authorities deem suitable education for a young person with disabilities. She recalls a \"heartbreaking\" visit to a local day centre, which catered for an age range of 18 to 80, that her local authority argued could provide for Joe's needs. \"I said: 'I don't think it's appropriate for 18-year-olds to be with 80-year-olds \u2013 people with Alzheimer's \u2013 or vice versa.' When my other son left school, nobody suggested it would be OK to mix with 80-year-olds so why is that OK for Joe? While the staff were doing their best, there was nothing in the way of learning or age-appropriate activities.\"</p> <p>A residential college placement gives students the opportunity to develop social skills and independence and, crucially, to mix with others like themselves. Kathryn Rudd, principal of National Star College, recalls one student saying: \"Coming here, for the first time, I haven't felt 'special'. I didn't have to get on a special bus to get here, I don't have to do 'special' things \u2026 I'm just 'normal' here.\"</p> <p>For some young people, this can make a huge difference \u2013 helping them to develop the skills to volunteer, work or live semi-independently, something they are far less likely to do if they are \"coming home from college in a taxi and sitting at home on their own all evening,\" says Rudd.</p> <p>While some local authorities are clued up about the benefits of specialist colleges, others lack understanding and expertise. One parent \u2013 who did not wish to be named for fear it would jeopardise the funding bid for her son \u2013 told the Guardian: \"My local authority told me I only wanted my son to go to a specialist college because I couldn't handle having him at home \u2026 that really hurt. Like any parent, I just want the best possible education for my son.\"</p> <p>According to Anne Price, director of education and life skills at David Lewis College in Cheshire, and Natspec chair, the experience is typical of the \"postcode lottery\" faced by parents. \"If you're in a good local authority, with good staff, you'll get a good deal, and if you aren't, you'll get nothing. I have never known it as bad as this, ever.\"</p> <p>Placing young people who would benefit from specialist further education in local colleges or training providers may help local authorities make short-term savings, but, in the long term, it can prove more costly. A report published by the National Audit Office last year showed that equipping a young person with moderate learning disabilities with the skills to live semi-independently \u2013 rather than in fully supported housing \u2013 could reduce their lifetime support costs by around \u00a31m.</p> <p>And as Jane Stone, whose daughter Kate has Down's syndrome, found out, even the short-term savings can be negligible. After being turned down for funding for a specialist college, on the grounds that it was too expensive, Kate was offered a few hours at a college more than 10 miles away. Stone and her husband \u2013 both accountants \u2013 carried out a financial comparison of the costs of educating their daughter at a specialist college compared to a more local provider. \"We did a spreadsheet that showed if she stayed at home, social services would have to look after her from 10am-7pm, because we are out at work. So when you start adding up the cost of social care support at \u00a320 an hour, taxi fares to the college, respite care \u2026 it doesn't take long to stack up. That was basically how we won [their case for her to go to a specialist college] because we were able to show that [the alternative] wasn't cheaper.\"</p> <p>Stone readily admits that persistent parents who make a fuss can be successful in overturning local authorities' decisions. Time and money help too. As well as countless hours spent reading reports, writing letters and meeting with council officials, Stone spent \"two or three grand on a lawyer, just to write some sniffy letters\". Rae started a fundraising organisation \u2013 the Joe Rae Trust \u2013 and organised coffee mornings, talent shows and sponsored walks to raise funds to help fight Joe's case (and to put towards his college fees if the local authority refused funding).</p> <p>But under the new, even more complicated funding arrangements, there is a concern that only the most sharp-elbowed parents will be able to find their way around the system. \"What happens to those young people who haven't got someone behind them fighting every step of the way and threatening to take everyone on the planet to court?\" asks Rudd.</p> <p>And, if local authorities are increasingly reluctant to hand over the cash to fund young people to study at specialist FE colleges, it could threaten the colleges' very existence. \"We just don't know what this new system will be like \u2026 but it has the potential to destabilise the future of specialist provision,\" she says.</p> <p>A DfE spokesperson said the idea of the new policy was to make sure councils worked with health services. \"We will also be offering young people and parents the option of a personal budget so that they can have more control over how their support is delivered.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Profit and loss</strong><br></h2> <p>A further education college that seemed poised this year to become the first state-funded institution in England to be run for profit has been forced to reconsider a planning application to build on its sports fields after a major protest by residents.</p> <p>Barnfield College in Luton had hoped to develop its 14.3-hectare (35-acre) site with a new college building, an 88-bed care home, up to 39 houses and a \"free school\", while also redeveloping its sports pitches. But campaigners who oppose the \u00a325m plans say 382 people had complained as of last week, while Luton borough council's planning application website has 27 pages of letters of complaint.</p> <p>Residents seem most unhappy that a substantial part of the area, which, they say, was passed by the local authority to the college free of charge in the 1990s and is used extensively as open green space by the community, would be lost, and that traffic would grow significantly.</p> <p>In March, the Guardian revealed how Barnfield, which is part of a chain of academies and free schools, would become a profit-making body if plans to allow a proportion of its financial surplus to be paid to shareholders won the approval of its board. The notion of a profit-making institution gaining from what had been publicly maintained land had added to campaigners' ire, said Rubina Zaidi of the Barnfield Development Action Group.</p> <p>However, Barnfield says its original planning application had been \"completely withdrawn\" and also that the profit-making proposal had not yet gone ahead. The college is now looking at \"new ways to enhance and develop the site that will entirely remove the various concerns raised by local people\", says Alan Euinton, its principal.</p> <p>Luton borough council says it has yet to receive notification that the application was being withdrawn.</p> <h2><strong>Legal wrangle for teachers</strong><br></h2> <p>Staff who were left without redundancy payments or a job this month after two comprehensives closed and a free school opened on the site of one of them, could face a wait until the new year until their situation is resolved.</p> <p>Former teachers and support staff at St Wilfrid's high and St George of England high, both in Sefton, Merseyside, have been caught in the middle of a legal dispute between the local authority, the free school's trustees and the Department for Education.</p> <p>The local authority argues that under employment law, staff jobs at the two schools must transfer to the Hawthorne's free school, meaning no redundancy payments apply. But the Hawthorne's, backed by the DfE, says it is under no obligation to take on workers from the two closing schools.</p> <p>Sefton council is now seeking to challenge the DfE and free school's position in the high court, with an application expected to be submitted this week. Some staff are pursuing the matter through employment tribunals, but a former St George teacher says hearings are unlikely to start until December or January. \"We have been left in limbo, and people are getting increasingly outraged.\"</p> <h2><strong>Minister's useful A-level</strong><br></h2> <p>And finally \u2026 does Matthew Hancock, the new further education minister, have an FE past? Not, it would seem, if you looked on his personal Conservative party website before his appointment two weeks ago. It simply listed his education as primary school followed by King's school, Chester, then Oxford and Cambridge. But hours after his appointment, West Cheshire College \u2013 where he is said to have gained an A-level in computing \u2013 was added, though initially in a different font from the rest of the entry.</p> <p>The apparently frantic rejigging was revealed by the trade title FE Week. Nick Linford, its managing editor, says: \"Cynics might suggest the new minister was not bothered about his FE past until it became politically useful. Personally, I think it is good to see it there, in pride of place no doubt.\"</p>",
  "<p>Anti-abortion protesters who displayed pictures of aborted foetuses outside a clinic offering pregnancy terminations have been cleared of public order offences.</p> <p>Andrew Stephenson and Kathryn Sloane, members of Abort67, were accused of intimidating women who went for abortion services at a clinic run by Bpas in Brighton.</p> <p>A district judge sitting at Brighton magistrates court found them not guilty of displaying material that is threatening, abusive or insulting, under public order legislation.</p> <p>Abort67 has been demonstrating outside the clinic for five years.</p> <p>The pressure group Abortion Rights said the verdict \"demonstrates that the current law is inadequate to protect women from intimidation by hardline anti-abortion activists. It will be viewed as a green light for them to continue their aggressive campaign tactics. As a society we should be able to guarantee the privacy and safety of those seeking to access a legal medical treatment.\"</p> <p>Andrea Minichiello Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, which represented the accused pair, said: \"The dismissal of these charges will be welcomed by all who value freedom of speech and expression.\"</p> <p>She said they were seeking an urgent meeting with leaders of the Association of Chief Police Officers about the interpretation of the Public Order Act, \"to explore whether better guidance can be drawn up over the policing of such activities, especially those motivated by religious convictions\".</p> <p>Bpas said it did not take a position on the legality of the protest but questioned its morality. \"What takes place on a regular basis outside our clinic is not about debate or changing public opinion \u2013 it is simply about causing distress to individual women on what may already be a difficult day,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>It's all go in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2005/mar/17/theatre\" title=\"\">Sharman Macdonald</a>'s She Town. The Dundee mill-workers are angry because their wages are being cut; the choir is auditioning to accompany <a href=\"http://www.cairdhall.co.uk/history/\" title=\"\">Paul Robeson, the singer and civil rights activist, at his concert in the city's Caird Hall</a>; and the politically committed are preparing to go and fight the fascists in the Spanish civil war.</p> <p>With a background of child mortality, teenage pregnancy and squalid living conditions, the play identifies a potentially revolutionary period in Dundee's history, not least since a major part of the workforce was female. Appropriately, director Jemima Levick has brought together 44 women in this professional/community collaboration and with striking results: they move about the stage in the shadow of Alex Lowde's towering tenement set, creating the impression of a city teeming with life.</p> <p>A shame, then, that it comes across as so joyless a play. The women are always bickering (about what, it's often hard to say); but worse, they are downtrodden rather than fervent, their anger too easily cowed by reactionary ideology. When the mill-owner's wife accuses them of \"politics borne of envy\", adding, \"that's no politics at all\", they are oddly quick to agree. With so many people on stage and with such polemical material, you would expect something celebratory and defiant. This seems muted and humourless.</p> <p>That's not a charge you could level at Chris Rattray's The Mill Lavvies, which has no political ambitions but offers much jolly banter as it follows the working day in a cloth factory from the perspective of the gents' loos.

As important as the plans themselves was the thinking behind this move.</p> <p>According to Romney strategist Ed Gillespie, the idea was to introduce the voters to Mitt Romney the man at the Republican National Convention. Now, as we are heading into the homestretch, Americans want to hear policy specifics from the candidates.</p> <p>This is interesting because Romney has built his campaign on several assumptions. The first is that voters wouldn't really be paying attention during the summer and would start to really focus on the race during the fall. Therefore, it was safe to allow the Obama campaign to outspend Romney 2-1 in several swing states \u2013 not counting assists from Super Pacs on both sides \u2013 and saturate the airwaves with ads, because nobody would watching. Romney would wait to open his wallet and launch his air attack when the voters were engaged.</p> <p>There's political science data that contradicts this theory, as does the recent example of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. Eight years ago, a shaky incumbent took to the airwaves early to define his little known and less liked challenger. Kerry never recovered. Romney is betting he'll be different.</p> <p>The second assumption is that the election will be almost entirely a referendum on Barack Obama's performance in office, and that the economy makes it very unlikely the president can be re-elected. This, too, carries risk. Romney has done relatively little to define himself or his campaign. Weak economic growth has occasionally been compatible with presidential reelection. And a large percentage of the American people still blame George W Bush for the economy. The recession didn't begin under Obama's watch, even if his policies haven't stimulated much of a recovery.</p> <p>Now Romney seems to be assuming that the remaining swing voters can be reached by filling them in on the policy details he has left fuzzy throughout the campaign. This may be due to a dent in Romney's tax advantage caused by the Obama campaign's assertions that the Republican's tax plan would raise the burden on the middle class. But there's little evidence \"low-information undecideds\" will suddenly be turned by learning how Romney would regulate energy or tweak marginal tax rates.</p> <p>The most valid of Romney's assumptions is that his problems with the conservative base limit his freedom of movement. He can't pivot \u2013 as he clearly would like to \u2013 on healthcare and immigration, and might also want to on abortion. By itself, this isn't a problem, since this is shaping up to be a base election. But it has limited Romney's ability to develop a critique of Obama that goes beyond the committed Republican voter, as evidenced even by his Cairo embassy statement.</p> <p>Internal campaign sniping aside, what Romney is left with is essentially hoping that anti-Obama sentiment is large enough to keep him within the margin of error. Then, on election day, undecided voters could break heavily enough to put him over the top. It <em>could</em> work; it could be a strategy for topping out at around 48% of the vote.</p> <p>But it doesn't seem like the ambitious pursuit of a mandate some conservatives expected when Romney tapped Paul Ryan as his running-mate.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Romney's Libya criticism could have been stronger'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285839\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's reaction to the attacks and murders of American Consul to Libya Chris Stevens and several of his colleagues was not a faux pas, as Democrats and their cheerleaders in the media claim. In fact, his criticism could have been stronger for maximum impact.</p> <p>In 1980, when Iran held 52 Americans hostage, thumbing their nose at \"threats\" by President Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan sent a strong message that was unmistakable in its resolve: when Reagan became president of the United States, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeni would face the harsh reality of what a strong American president would do in the face of a hostage situation. Reagan was Carter's opponent in the election, and the incumbent president's weakness and impotence, and their danger to America, had developed into a key issue in the final weeks of the campaign. Carter, like Obama, also had failed domestically \u2013 on the economy, gas prices, and joblessness \u2013 and looked for others to blame.</p> <p>In September 1980, Carter was leading Reagan in the polls by 8 points. But in the face of domestic and foreign policy failures mirroring those of President Barack Obama today, the incumbent lost to Reagan on election day. America's choice for leadership was confirmed as the correct decision when Iran released the American hostages, just as Ronald Reagan was placing his hand on the Bible and being sworn in as president. While pro-Carter historians have twisted themselves into pretzels trying to implicate Carter as the man behind ending the hostage crisis, the facts speak otherwise.</p> <p>President Obama has proven to be weak-kneed, caving to Islamic extremists, including al-Qaida, by perp-walking an American film-maker out of his home for producing a film on Islam our enemies in the Middle East are falsely claiming as the reason for the anti-American riots and murders across the region. But the truth is beginning to haunt Obama, as we now know the attacks were planned, and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/16/libyan-president-magariaf-military-action\">Obama administration was made aware of the impending doom</a>, but ignored the information and declined to share it with Ambassador Stevens and others.</p> <p>That President Obama chose to skip six days of security briefings during that period, and more than half in his presidency, sets him up for comparisons to failed President Carter \u2013 and for being held accountable for placing Americans overseas at risk. As it becomes apparent that President Obama misled the American public, and that Americans died as a consequence of his inaction, his presidency&#xa0;should be&#xa0;over.</p> <p>Yet the media seem to remain intent on protecting Obama, even in light of the danger his incompetence has proven to present.</p> <p>While most polls show Romney trailing Obama nationally, the most accurate from 2008, Rasmussen, shows Romney leading. However, Obama appears to have the edge in more of the key battleground states Romney needs in order to win. Despite overblown reports of the Romney campaign infighting, which nearly match recent stories about conflict among top Obama aides, the Republican nominee needs to be able to turn on a dime and fully address Obama's dangerous foreign policy \u2013 or rather lack thereof \u2013 while hitting Obama on the tanked economy, $16tn national debt, 23 milllion jobless, and Obamacare.</p> <p>In short, Mitt Romney needs to understand that the media is against him. He must not utter anything superfluous to his core message \u2013 eliminating the media's scope to focus on anything other than substance: they can't quote him on what he doesn't say. Romney's argument on substance versus Obama's lies and obfuscation will win the day.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-lewis\">Matt Lewis</a>: 'Romney now needs strong debate performances'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285840\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/4/7/1302195821539/mattlewis_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Lewis\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If someone isn't comfortable in his own skin \u2013 if he doesn't really know who he is \u2013 everyone can tell. Campaigns are similar, and Mitt Romney's campaign has been looking self-divided lately.</p> <p>Despite a few flirtations with boldness (including the selection of Representative Paul Ryan as his running-mate), the Romney campaign always reverts to passivity. This is surprising and unfortunate, inasmuch as the boldness has usually worked. </p> <p>The strategy also seems to imply a belief in the (probably) false premise that a bad economy would automatically doom Obama \u2013 and that Romney could win by simply raising campaign cash, running perfunctory TV ads, and staying above the fray and under the radar. (Today, the theory that the 2012 election is solely a referendum on Obama seems quaint. But the Romney campaign might have been the last to notice.)</p> <p>This premise has manifested itself in various ways, including Romney's single-minded focus on the economy. Supporters call this \"message discipline\", but being elected president is about more than any one facet of political life \u2013 no matter how important that facet might be. Romney's Middle East comments last week were ill-timed, to be sure, but they were at least a recognition that the 2012 campaign is also about foreign policy, national security, and yes, even social issues.</p> <p>Interestingly, the notion that a Republican could win on the economy alone doesn't seem to jibe with history. Liberals can always promise more giveaways \u2013 a fact that can make them seem more appealing during tough economic times. Sure, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980 because of malaise \u2013 but there was also the Iranian hostage crisis.</p> <p>To win, Romney must give voters a reason to vote <em>for him</em> \u2013 not just a reason to oppose Obama. He must present a coherent worldview that contrasts him with Obama's interrelated policies. It is important that we see his vision. And yes, there should be some specifics. The notion that he can skate by without providing details \u2013 that he can run out the clock and hope we don't check his homework \u2013 won't fly. </p> <p>There are three big moments in general election campaigns: The selection of a running mate, the convention, and the debates. In the next 50 or so days, Mitt Romney has to find a way to get his groove back \u2013 and this will clearly require strong debate performances.</p> <p>Despite the campaign infighting and ill-advised press conference during last week's Middle East turmoil, Mitt Romney can still win this election. Like a sports team on a losing streak things look bleak. But wining covers a multitude of sins.</p> <p>If Romney catches fire \u2013 which is still possible \u2013 his campaign problems suddenly look trivial. As they say, nothing succeeds like success.</p> <p><em>Matt Lewis is a senior contributor on politics to the Daily Caller</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'Just being \"Not Obama\" isn't going to be enough'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285836\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There are three changes the Romney campaign ought to make immediately.</p> <p>1) Enough with \"Obama isn't working.\" Yes, we know. It's obvious. No one needs to be reminded that unemployment is high. When you spend so much time repeating what everyone already knows, people begin to wonder if you really have that much else to say.</p> <p>2) The Romney campaign \u2013 Romney, most of his surrogates, and its ads and web videos \u2013 needs to connect the dots a lot more. If you watch Bill Clinton talk about a policy, there's a particular rhythm: first, here's the problem; second, here's what's causing the problem; third, here's what we're going to do; fourth, here's how it will work; and fifth, here's the result you'll see when it works. </p> <p>3) The campaign just needs to move <em>faster</em>: news cycles come and go without Romney managing to staple his agenda and ideas to the passing events. Last week would have been a golden opportunity to discuss what Romney really thinks of the Arab Spring: did America look at the uprisings in the region too optimistically? Is the Arab world ready for democracy, or is that just setting the stage for demagogues and/or Islamists? Have any of our public diplomacy efforts in recent years really paid off, or have they amounted to feelgood talk?</p> <p>And when Ben Bernanke and the Fed enacted QE3 last week, didn't that seem like a golden opportunity to showcase the Romney campaign argument about how the US economy is in a rut where all traditional methods of \"stimulus\" have proven disappointing? And how about the <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/321107/scathing-fast-furious-ig-report-imminent\">expected upcoming release of the Department of Justice inspector general's report</a> on the \"Fast and Furious\" scandal? That's a perfect opportunity to make an address on the \"culture of unaccountability\" in Washington \u2013 found in the GSA (general services administration), as well as the DOJ \u2013 and how a Romney administration would fix that.</p> <p>Opportunities come and go.

This year's contrasting successor to his Golden XPlosion debut with British mentor <a href=\"http:// easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~jemuk/django-mp3/home.htm\" title=\"\">Django Bates </a> features Neset's sax in conversation with the young Norwegian tuba maestro <a href=\"http://mariusneset.com/marius-neset-daniel-herskedal/\" title=\"\">Daniel Herskedal</a>.

Then they whisked through the prancing, folksy, Garbarek-like Ara's Dance, a solo exposition of slurred low sounds and layers of high, guitar-toned pedal-effects from Herskedal (who uses electronics imaginatively), and played a graceful soprano sax ballad, The Christmas Song. Neset returned to the tenor sax for an unaccompanied improvisation, turning his imaginative virtuosity up to full power: circuitous runs resolved in quietly inquisitive gestures and he showed secure control of delicate high sounds way above the instrument's register. The pair wound up with another sprightly folk-dance, which sounded both Scandinavian and Anatolian.

  "<p>Camelot, the winner of the 2,000 Guineas and Derby, ran 5lb below his best form when he was beaten at Doncaster on Saturday in the St Leger, the final leg of the Triple Crown, according to the British Horseracing Authority's handicapper.</p> <p>Camelot has been rated 119 for his performance at Town Moor, the same mark he achieved in the Guineas at Newmarket but 1lb behind the winner Encke, who improved by 8lb on his previous rating of 112.</p> <p>Camelot improved to 124 when he stretched five lengths clear of Main Sequence, the runner-up, in the Derby in early June.</p> <p>The BHA's figures are closely matched by those of the Timeform organisation, which assessed Camelot as running 6lb below his best form at Doncaster. Prior to the race Timeform described Camelot as a \"certainty\" to complete the Triple Crown but after his three-quarter length defeat by Encke his \"master\" rating has been reduced from 130 to 128 and his Leger run assessed at 122.</p> <p>\"The Derby form is not working out as well as we hoped it might at the time,\" David Johnson, Timeform's Flat editor, said . \"Obviously it was disappointing that Camelot could not win the Leger. Even his new rating of 128 should have been good enough to win a typical Leger but, for whatever reason, he was not the Camelot we saw in the Derby.</p> <p>\"The hope now is that he is not just rushed off to stud. We need to see him in a race like the Arc or the Champion Stakes or racing as a four-year-old. It would be a real shame if he went out on a performance like that.\"</p> <p>With the Coolmore Stud syndicate which owns Camelot still considering the options for their colt, there was little sign in the ante-post markets that another outing for the Derby winner is imminent. Camelot has been removed from the betting for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe by all major bookmakers while he could be backed at over 20-1, albeit for tiny sums, on the Betfair betting exchange on Monday evening.</p> <p>The Arc betting was largely unchanged following the trials meeting at Longchamp on Sunday, although the French Derby winner Saonois, who was available at 12-1 after winning the Prix Niel, is now no bigger than 10-1. The Niel has historically been the best of the three Arc trials staged three weeks before the race itself, with Arc winners including Bago, Dalakhani and Sinndar having contested both races since 2000, although there is now a six-year gap since Rail Link became the last Niel winner to take the Arc.</p> <p>Maarek, the top weight for the Ayr Gold Cup, the big betting race in Britain this weekend, could yet line up for the race despite having won the Group Three Greenlands Stakes at The Curragh three days ago.</p> <p>\"If it comes up soft enough we'll run,\" David Nagle, Maarek's trainer, said. \"He's in good form and there's no other suitable race until Ascot [on 20 October]. I'll probably claim off him and [5lb claimer] Mark Enright will probably ride.</p> <p>\"He's been on the go a long time, he ran on the first day of the season at The Curragh but he's holding his form brilliantly. He beat Gordon Lord Byron at Naas, giving him 5lb, and he [Gordon Lord Byron] won at York [in August] and finished second in a Group One [the Sprint Cup at Haydock].\"</p> <p>BetFred, which took control of the Tote last year and with it the sponsorship of the Gold Cup at Cheltenham, has extended its deal to support the Festival's showpiece event for the next three years.</p> <p>\"People from all walks of life get excited by the Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup,\" Paul Fisher, group managing director of Jockey Club Racecourses, said on Monday, \"and we look forward to continuing to grow its unique appeal.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement, has called for new demonstrations to express outrage at a film that denigrates Islam and the prophet Muhammad, as unrest triggered by it continues from Tunisia to Indonesia.</p> <p>\"Prophet of God, we offer ourselves, our blood and our kin for the sake of your dignity and honour,\" Nasrallah told supporters who chanted \"death to Israel\" and \"death to America\" at a rally in the southern Shia suburbs of Beirut. \"The US should understand that if it broadcasts the film in full it will face very dangerous repercussions around the world.\"</p> <p>Nasrallah, who fears assassination by Israel, appears in public only rarely. Political opponents suggested that anger over the film, Innocence of Muslims, was a useful diversion from the bloody crisis in neighbouring Syria, where the Assad government, along with Iran, is a patron of the Lebanese militant group.</p> <p>In Tunis, police surrounded a mosque where a Salafi leader was meeting followers. Sheikh Saif-Allah Benhassine is wanted by police over clashes at the US embassy last week, but he managed to slip past the cordon and escape.</p> <p>President Barack Obama called US diplomatic staff in Sudan, Tunisia, Libya and Yemen at the weekend, to reassure them that their security is a top priority for the US government.</p> <p>Reflecting nervousness about the protests in the region, the US embassy in Beirut has started to destroy classified material as a security precaution, the Associated Press reported.</p> <p>In Benghazi, Libya's second city, the Islamist brigade suspected of involvement in the death of US ambassador Chris Stevens last week said that America was to blame for allowing the release of the film.</p> <p>\"We categorically deny we were there,\" said Youssef el-Gehani, spokesman of the Ansar al-Sharia brigade. \"American policies target some of the most sacred elements of our religion so you should expect a reaction,\" he told the Guardian. \"The embassy [US consulate] knew how sensitive it was to have that film, they should have evacuated the embassy.\"</p> <p>At the weekend, Libya's de facto head of state, Mohamed al-Magariaf, said Ansar al-Sharia members were involved in the night-long assault that left four US consulate staff dead. He linked the group to al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb.</p> <p>Gehani warned that the US would continue to face attacks in Muslim countries. \"If America wants respect in the Arab world, it should avoid spilling blood in places such as Syria and Afghanistan, and avoid insulting the prophet.\"</p> <p>His comments came amid chaos within Libya's government, with the deputy interior minister, Wanis al-Sharif, being sacked after claiming that 50 suspects had been arrested in connection with the attack on the anniversary of 9/11. The interior minister, Fawzi Abdul Al, insisted only four arrests had been made.</p> <p>On Sunday a video was released showing Stevens was still alive when he was found after the attack. A Libyan witness told the Associated Press that Stevens was still breathing, though his face was blackened and he seemed paralysed.</p> <p>In Pakistan, the prime minister, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, ordered the suspension of YouTube over the \"blasphemous\" Muhammad film. Two protesters were killed as police used teargas and fired into the air to control crowds which have grown since last week. Thousands of people shouting anti-American slogans took to the streets in Peshawar, Lahore, and, for a second day, in Karachi.</p> <p>Violent rage also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/afghanistan-protests-anti-islam-film\" title=\"\">spread to Kabul</a> in Afghanistan, with hundreds of people taking to the streets, burning tyres and a car, and attacking police and a US base with stones.</p> <p>Indonesian police fired teargas and water cannon to disperse hundreds of demonstrators who massed outside the US embassy in Jakarta, the capital of the world's most populous Muslim country.</p> <p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted on state TV as saying that western leaders must prove they were not \"accomplices\" in a \"big crime\".</p> <p>In Egypt, two prominent figures are facing legal action over broadcasting a clip of the film. Khaled Abdallah, an ultra-conservative television anchor, and Nader Bakkar, spokesman of the Salafi al-Nour party, stand accused of instigating violence that led to the storming of the US embassy in&#xa0;Cairo.</p> <p>Tony Blair, meanwhile, told the BBC that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/17/tony-blair-west-pressure-assad\" title=\"\">offending film was \"wrong and offensive but also laughable</a> as a piece of film-making\". He added: \"What is dangerous and wrong is the reaction to it.\"</p> <p>The family of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula left their California home in the middle of the night on Monday and have been taken to an undisclosed location, a Los Angeles police spokesman said.</p> <p>Nakoula has been identified by US federal authorities as the key figure behind Innocence of Muslims.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theatredatabase.com/20th_century/stanley_houghton_001.html\" title=\"\">Stanley Houghton</a> was part of the Manchester school of playwrights that did so much to enliven British drama in the years before the first world war. And this excellent revival of Houghton's 1912 play reminds us of his virtues: a firm sense of structure, a rejection of fossilised attitudes, and a passionate belief in female independence.</p> <p>Houghton's play is, among other things, an assault on moral rigidity, whether it comes from the workers or their bosses. The trouble starts when the working-class Hawthorns discover that their daughter, Fanny, has spent a dirty weekend in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/apr/26/escape-boutique-review-llandudno-wales\" title=\"\">Llandudno</a> with Alan Jeffcote, son of the local mill-owner. Shock and horror ensues with both the sternly self-righteous Mrs Hawthorn and the self-made Jeffcote senior arguing that the young couple have no alternative but to get married. Houghton complicates the issue, however, by asking us to consider first the feelings of Alan's fiancee, and then the proto-feminist leanings of the suddenly articulate Fanny.</p> <p>Somewhat disingenuously, Houghton said his play was simply \"an entertainment\". In reality, it exposes the sexual double-standards of the period. When Alan describes his fling with Fanny as \"just an amusement, a lark\", it is considered understandable; when Fanny uses almost exactly the same words, Alan is profoundly shocked. And the commodification of sex is neatly captured when Alan's father indignantly asks: \"Why hadn't thou the sense to pay for thy pleasures instead of getting mixed up with a straight girl?\"</p> <p>The tension sags only in the stilted encounter between Alan and his fiancee. Otherwise, Houghton's play belongs to an extraordinary period in British drama that, within the space of a year, yielded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jan/20/archive-1943-extremes-in-spoken-english\" title=\"\">George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/aug/14/githa-sowerby-playwright-rutherford-son\" title=\"\">Githa Sowerby's Rutherford &amp; Son</a> \u2013 both plays, like his, about women finding their voice in accordance with shifts in society.</p> <p>Bethan Dear's strongly cast revival not only brings out Houghton's progressive instinct, but also deftly conveys the play's internal marital tensions. Richard Durden's arrogantly assertive Mr Jeffcote and Anna Carteret's hectoring Mrs Hawthorn are clearly two of a kind: Susan Penhaligon and Peter Ellis, as their respective partners, reveal softer, more forgiving natures. Ellie Turner also conveys Fanny's emergence from deceptive lies to downright truth and Graham O'Mara pins down Alan's moral hypocrisy. As with the Royal Exchange's 1998 revival, we are reminded what a resilient play this is and what a loss was Houghton's death in 1913. And who is to say that, 100 years after Hindle Wakes, we still don't live in a world that has one law for sexually adventurous men and another for women?</p> <p>Until 29 September.

  "<p>Professor <a href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/cca/staff/johnbutt/\" title=\"\">John Butt</a> is of that rare breed: a music academic who is also a genuinely thrilling performer. As one of the world's <a href=\"http://www.dunedin-consort.org.uk/news/john-butt-wins-the-royal-academy-of-music-kohn-foundation-bach-prize/\" title=\"\">foremost Bach scholars</a>, he brings vigorous insight to the period ensemble he conducts from the harpsichord, the Edinburgh-based <a href=\"http://www.dunedin-consort.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Dunedin Consort</a>. But there's flamboyancy and pathos in his musicianship, too, that always cuts to the heart of a work's emotional drama. This performance of Bach's St John Passion, opening the <a href=\"http://www.lammermuirfestival.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lammermuir festival</a> and giving a glimpse into Dunedin's <a href=\"http://www.dunedin-consort.org.uk/news/be-part-of-our-world/\" title=\"\">forthcoming recording of the piece</a>, was a case in point.</p> <p>Forces were stripped down to one-per-part in orchestra and voices \u2013 eight singers in total \u2013 so that the soloists also formed the chorus. A few moments wanted more oomph from the strings, particularly the surging opening chorus, but generally the ensemble sounded lithe and mellow, and the singers shone with artful, pinpoint precision. The chorus played its fickleness well: swaggering as soldiers, nitpicking as law abiders, snidely jovial as chief priests. <a href=\"http://nicholasmulroy.com/\" title=\"\">Nicholas Mulroy</a> was particularly strong as the Evangelist, with a beguilingly sweet tenor and a knack for compelling storytelling; <a href=\"http://www.bobdaviesbaritone.com/\" title=\"\">Robert Davies</a> was a noble Pilate. I should admit that due to a nasty (and noisy) cough, I spent a sizeable chunk of Part One listening from the kitchenette at the back of the church, but even from here the diction came across loud and clear.</p> <p>The gripping underlying drama came from Butt's masterful handling of pace, both in tiny nuances and broad architecture. Totally attuned to the harmonic framework of the piece, he breathed space into all the right places, built frenetic tension to the point of the crucifixion and allowed a palpable sense of release at the crux line, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOoe8K1yj50\" title=\"\">\"Es ist vollbracht</a>\" (All is fulfilled).</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 September 2012. The original referred to Robert Davies as a noble Pilot. That should, of course, have been Pilate, and has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The headlines will undoubtedly be made by the continued absence \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 of Kevin Pietersen, but when England finally announce their squad for the four-Test tour of India , the young Yorkshire opener Joe Root is expected to be confirmed as the man seen as the likeliest long-term successor to Andrew Strauss at the top of the order.</p> <p>The 21-year-old Root who started his career at the same Sheffield club as Michael Vaughan, was named by the Cricket Writers' Club as the 64th winner of the Young Cricketer of the Year award on Monday \u2013 and dropped a pleasingly na\u00efve hint in his acceptance speech that it will not be the last recognition he receives this week.</p> <p>While the appointment of Alastair Cook to take over as the captain in Test as well as one-day cricket following Strauss's retirement was a formality, there has been much more conjecture about who would replace the former captain as Cook's opening partner in India.</p> <p>Michael Carberry, Nick Compton and Varun Chopra have all been proposed as contenders from county cricket, and England also had the option of promoting Jonathan Trott or Ian Bell. But Root has been regarded as the coming man for a while, having been selected regularly for the England Lions and worked especially closely with Graham Thorpe.</p> <p>He had a solid, if not overwhelming, season playing Division Two cricket with Yorkshire. But the India tour, while a daunting challenge in many ways, could be seen as a good opportunity to expose a young opener ahead of the back-to-back Ashes series that lie ahead in 2012-13.</p> <p>Inevitably, the uncertainty surrounding Pietersen is a relevant factor, as his absence in India would leave England reluctant to rob their middle order of further experience by promoting Trott or Bell. The general expectation is that Pietersen will be omitted, which would represent a fourth snub in little more than a month after he was dropped from the third Test against South Africa, left out of the World Twenty20 squad and stripped of his central contract.</p> <p>But following the five-day delay in the squad announcement which was originally due last Thursday, no one will know for sure until England's national selector Geoff Miller brings the saga to a close with his first public uttering for almost a month on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>If Pietersen is left out, that would raise further questions over when, or whether, he might ever play for England again. Omission would leave him free to play for his Indian Premier League franchise Delhi Daredevils in the Champions League t20 competition in South Africa next month, and then to take up one of the offers he has received to appear in Australia's Big Bash Twenty20 tournament in December and January.</p> <p>The next opportunity for England inclusion would come in the five-match one-day series in India in the New Year, which is followed by more limited-overs games in New Zealand before a three-Test series begins in March. But another snub would represent a huge test of the commitment to England which he expressed in the You Tube interview during which he rescinded his one-day international retirement last month.</p> <p>Like England's team director, Andy Flower, and his Twenty20 squad, Pietersen will be in Colombo when the squad is confirmed. He flew to Sri Lanka on Monday ahead of his media commitments in the ICC World Twenty20 tournament, having signed up to work as a pundit for ESPN Star Sports in the period between his retirement from one-day international cricket in May and his offer to rescind that decision in August.</p> <p>Looming in the background are consecutive Ashes series, in England in the second half of next summer then Australia in the winter of 2013-14. Perhaps Pietersen will reveal his plans on ESPN.</p>",
  "<p>When the competition is stronger, you need to be smarter, nimbler and more imaginative to survive. Pitted against the commercial muscle of France, Italy and the US, British fashion lives on its wits. And those who dismiss fashion as vacuous should know that new ideas are essential to selling frocks.</p> <p>The ideas fuelling the latest crop of London fashion week shows were drawn from sources near and far: from an east London park to Florence and Rajasthan via Outer Space.</p> <p>For Christopher Kane, inspiration struck during a walk in Victoria Park, near the Olympic Park in east London, with his sister and close collaborator, Tammy, and her baby daughter. Christopher noticed the ornate wingnuts on the ironwork of a bridge. Something about the shape chimed with his studio experimentation with taking a bow motif, that symbol of don't-frighten-the-horses ladylike dressing, as the starting point for something bold and sculptural.</p> <p>\"We started with something sickly sweet, and messed it up until we ended up somewhere darker,\" he said. With bolts and wingnuts remade in clear plastic as fastenings on ribbon folds of fabric \u2013 milk white, sugar pink and daffodil yellow \u2013 the collection took on a life of its own, a wardrobe for a pastel Frankenstein's monster.</p> <p>From the very first outfit \u2013 a biker jacket suit in white leather relief-embossed with roses \u2013 it was a collection fired with drama and perfectly pitched to please Kane's young, fashion-crazed fanbase.</p> <p>Erdem is adult and well-mannered, where Christopher Kane is young and raucous. (To signal this to anyone who hadn't picked it up, Jessie Ware joined the Alexa Chung gang in the front row at Kane, while Lady Mary from Downton Abbey observed Erdem with aristocratic poise, chaperoned by Vogue staffers).</p> <p>But the humour and detail in Erdem's clothes appeals to women whose poise masks a mischievous streak, a fact neatly reflected in the story he told backstage about the genesis of his collection: it was inspired, he said, by a 1950s science fiction short story about reptilian aliens who try to blend in as respectable women. Slivers of python were inserted between slices of lace. Fifties detailing \u2013 back vents that give a cocoon silhouette, ornate crystal necklaces \u2013 were set off-kilter by pretty colours used in deliberately odd combinations: fuschia, yellow and tangerine, for example.</p> <p>Peter Pilotto is a Dalston-based label whose graphic pieces are currently scoring high across the celebrity matrix. As well as regular glossy magazine appearances, the label was recently worn by Princess Beatrice to the Olympic Park. Peter Pilotto \u2013 a duo, confusingly, despite the name \u2013 are at the vanguard of a revolutionary London fashion movement which has reinvented print for a generation of women who considered traditional patterns old hat.</p> <p>Like Mary Katrantzou, whose weekend show reworked imagery from postage stamps and banknotes, they take a rich, cultured aesthetic and use modern technology to make it into something more accessible. Colours and patterns which once had a tendency to stifle the clothes with museum-piece nostalgia are digitally engineered into something more digestible to the modern palate.</p> <p>The latest catwalk collection showcased new latest advances in digital engineering. Working with a new software programme that enables designers Peter Pilotto and his partner, Christophe De Vos, to experiment with infinite combinations of layered patterns \u2013 a process they describe as \"a digital kaleidoscope\" \u2013 they spliced ideas taken from early English calligraphy, images from Florentine frescoes, and colour combinations they fell in love with during a summer holiday in Rajasthan. The impact of the software on these dense visuals is a little like putting reams of statistics into a spreadsheet. The finished product is infinitely more accessible.</p> <p>The effect of print layering is counterintuitive. One might expect that a geometric dark grid laid on top of swirls of bright colour would dampen the impact, but instead it seems to serve as a harness, channelling the energy of the look into something more dynamic. On dresses, slim trousers and the label's bestselling curvy pencil skirts, print and silhouette were in harmony.</p> <p>The imprint of other London catwalk shows seemed to have fed in to the collection at times \u2013 the marbling that was the focus of Stella McCartney's one-off London show in February, and the baroque sensibility of Mary Katrantzou \u2013 but the result was surprising and fresh. This collection may not match the commercial splash made by its autumn predecessor \u2013 that had a coherent, recognisable thread that this more complicated show perhaps lost \u2013 but it promises a bright future nonetheless.</p> <p>Technical innovation in print and fabric is a key factor in the dynamism of London fashion. Fabrics on Kane's catwalk this season include basketweave silks and injection-moulded rubber, while Erdem worked with an embroidery company in Switzerland experimenting with the use of classic couture techniques on modern plasticised fabric.</p> <p>Antonio Berardi, keen to show a sportier side to a label known for exquisite taste and refined sex appeal, experimented with a new Aertex-effect mesh that holds its shape while maintaining the freshness of openwork. \"The only problem is, it is incredibly expensive,\" admitted the designer after the show. \"I am always asking, how can we make this better.

His plans were published in full<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2203826/Michael-Gove-New-rigorous-exams-abolish-GCSEs.html\"> in the Mail on Sunday yesterday</a> and the only significant new fact in the announcement was the name of the new exam, the English baccalaureate certificate. Gove said that changing the exam would enable English pupils to compete with the best in the world.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We plan to call these new qualifications - in core academic subjects - English Baccalaureate Certificates - recognising that they are the academic foundation which is the secure base on which further study, vocational learning or a satisfying apprenticeship can be built. Success in English, maths, the sciences, a humanities subject and a language will mean that the student has the full English Baccalaureate.</p> <p>Now some will argue that more rigorous qualifications in these subjects will inevitably lead to more students failing. But we believe that fatalism is indicative of a dated mind-set; one that believes in a distribution of abilities so fixed that great teaching can do little to change.</p> <p>And we know that great teaching is changing lives even as we speak. We have the best generation of teachers and headteachers we have ever had. Their excellence combined with reforms and improvements to education that this Government are making through improved teacher training, greater freedoms for head teachers and the growth of academies and free schools will mean more students will be operating at a higher level.</p> <p>So even as exams become more rigorous, more students will be equipped to clear this higher bar. Indeed, we are explicitly ambitious for all our children \u2013 and we believe that over time we will catch up with the highest performing nations and a higher proportion of children will clear the bar than now.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gove adopted a belligerent tone in his statement, accusing Labour of devaluing GCSEs by introducing modules and extending the use of coursework. But, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2162369/Michael-Gove-plans-scrap-dumbed-GCSEs-bring-O-Levels.html\">if the Daily Mail report from earlier this summer about his plans was accurate </a>(and no one is suggesting that it was not), Gove has retreated in some respects. The introduction of the new exam has been postponed and at this stage he is only proposing that pupils start studying for the English baccalaureate certificate in English, maths and science from September 2015; other subjects will follow at some unspecified point in the future.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, has said that Labour will not support exam reform that does not benefit all pupils.</strong> Responding to Gove's statement in the Commons, Twigg said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The education leaving age is rising to 18, we need to face the challenges of the 21st century. But I simply don't accept that we achieve that by returning to a system abolished as out of date in the 1980s. Instead, we need a system that promotes rigour and breadth, and prepares young people for the challenges of the modern economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gove said that Twigg's comments showed that Labour was failing to embrace reform.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Teaching unions have strongly condemned the plans.</strong> Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \"The secretary of state has embarked from the outset on a cynical and wholly unjustifiable attempt to discredit the quality and rigour of the GCSE qualification.\" And Christine Blower, the general secretary of the NUT, said Gove's approach was \"nonsensical\".</p> <p>That's it from me for today.

We need to raise the level of challenge in our Key Stage 4 qualifications to match the best in the world. Raising our expectations of attainment for all students will drive up standards as teaching and learning improve to <br>meet that challenge. High expectations are essential to creating a step change in standards and allowing us to keep pace with our international competitors.</p> <p>1.2. Our proposals will restore confidence by ending the perverse incentives created by the interaction of our qualifications and accountability system. At present, schools are incentivised to boost their performance by seeking examinations in which they believe their students may achieve higher grades, and Awarding Organisations have a corresponding incentive to compete for market share by <br>providing less demanding examinations.</p> <p>1.3. To remove that perverse incentive, we will move away from the competition between Awarding Organisations in the core academic subjects of English, mathematics, sciences, history, geography and languages. Instead of schools being able to choose between competing GCSEs in these subjects, a competition will be held to identify the best, single suite of qualifications in each subject offered by a single Awarding Organisation.</p> <p>1.4. We intend to use the school and post-16 accountability frameworks to incentivise schools and colleges to teach these new qualifications both at Key Stage 4 and post-16. Schools will start teaching new qualifications in English, mathematics and sciences from 2015, with students first entering the new exams in the summer of 2017. We will refocus the Department\u2019s floor standard measures which identify <br>underperforming schools to take account of performance in our new English, mathematics and sciences qualifications from 2017. The timetable for the introduction of qualifications in history, geography and languages, and the timetable for the introduction of English and mathematics post-16, will be determined following responses to this consultation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T17:27:08.519Z\">at 6.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50574f9dc0e3d221b423ae85\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T16:28:15.120Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The NUT has now issued its response to Gove's plans. Here an extract from <a href=\"http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/16543\">the statement from <strong>Christine Blower</strong>, the NUT general secretary.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is an inherent contradiction at the heart of Michael Gove\u2019s criticism of GCSEs. On the one hand the Education Secretary demands ever higher pass rates, yet when this is achieved, claims that it can only have occurred due to examinations becoming too easy. This is a nonsensical approach. Parents and carers know how hard their children work for GCSEs and how \u2018rigorous\u2019 the exams are. Ministers need to recognise that it is through sheer hard work and determination that pupils and teachers are achieving great results.</p> <p>What is being proposed here is blatantly a two-tier system. Pupils who do not gain EBacc Certificates will receive a record of achievement which will most certainly be seen to be of far less worth by employers and colleges.</p> <p>Placing a cap on those who can gain top grades means that many students will miss out on the recognition and opportunities they deserve and harks back to a time when only a few were expected to go on to higher education.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T17:11:57.417Z\">at 6.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5057465ec0e3d221b423ae75\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T16:18:05.780Z\">5.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some Twitter comment on the Gove statement, which has just finished.</p> <p>From Labour's Liz Kendall</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/leicesterliz/status/247723105487843328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Abolishing course work in qualifications except D&amp;T &amp; art is real mistake.

In each subject areas, only one board will offer the exam.</p> <p>The new qualifications will be called English baccalaureate certificates.</p> <p>Some say this will lead to more students failing.</p> <p>But, Gove says, that reflects a fatalist mindset.</p> <p>More students will be operating at a higher level, he says.</p> <p>Gove says the government is \"explicitly ambitious\" for all children. It expects pupils to do better. All students who do GCSEs will be expected to sit the new exam.</p> <p>Students who are not able to set the new exam could sit it at 17 or 18, he says.</p> <p>Teachers will start teaching for the new qualification in English, maths and science in September 2015.

Continuous assessment helps mitigate against the very many personal problems young adults begin to experience more frequently after they turn 16. Too often, teachers reading this will agree, have good pupils faltered at the last educational hurdle because of relationship, family, emotional or economic difficulties. Creating a one-off exam at the very end of studies cannot be said to accurately measure a student\u2019s ability in a particular subject. This change is devoid of compassion and shows how little Michael Gove understands the real world.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://ht.ly/dLo89\">\u2022 Fiona Millar at Local Schools Network says today\u2019s announcement should not overshadow a structural problem with the current exam system.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One fact that emerged last week has been perplexing me. Three pieces of evidence; the Ofqual letters to Edexcel leaked to the TES, the testimony of the Ofqual CEO to the Education Select Committee and the findings of the Welsh government\u2019s review into re-grading all focused on the role played by KS2 SATs results in the regulation of GCSE results. Education journalist Warwick Mansell as also written an extensive blog on this here.</p> <p>This statement on the Ofqual website summarises the situation. A prediction about GCSEs is made based on the KS2 results of the cohort in question. If that cohort exceeds expectations then the English exam regulator forces down the GCSE grades to bring them into line with predictions ...</p> <p>But if GCSE results are based on KS2 predictions, how can schools do what is expected of them in terms of the performance tables, RAISEonline and Ofsted? All these key measures of accountability rest on how well schools enable their pupils to make progress from KS2.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50572cfcc0e3eb823e694807\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T14:00:31.698Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from Greg Hurst, the Times' education editor</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GregHurstTimes/status/247693635578105856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>So the new exams to replace GCSEs in core subjects are to be called the English Baccalaureate Certificate (EBC)</p>&mdash; Greg Hurst (@GregHurstTimes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GregHurstTimes/status/247693635578105856\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-17T13:48:59+00:00\">September 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T14:58:07.445Z\">at 3.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50572caa58f9cf283191bdc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T13:59:08.316Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Leighton Andrews</strong>, the education minister in the Welsh government, told the World at One that Michael Gove's plan to replace GCSEs sounded like \"a backwards step for England\". <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-19620759#?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">There's a story about his comments on the BBC's website. </a>Here's the key quote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It sounds to me as though it's a backwards step for England to be honest.

Asked if the government would delay universal credit, he said it was \u201con track\u201d to be implemented according to the current timetable. The government was \u201c100% committed\u201d to universal credit, he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Number 10 said the government\u2019s voluntary approach to getting more women on to company boards was working.</strong> Since March this year women have accounted for 44% of all appointments to FTSE 100 directorships, the spokesman said.

While until this moment the Tory guns have been silent, Tory operators have not been idle. They have been carefully researching Labour\u2019s weaknesses. Lessons have been learnt from the 1996 to 1997 period when the Conservative Party never settled on a consistent critique of Tony Blair. There\u2019ll be no return to the counter-productive demon eyes campaign. There will just be three endlessly repeated messages and they\u2019ll be delivered whenever possible by trusted surrogates.</p> <p>The ammunition has been loaded into the cannons, the carriage turned towards the enemy and the command to fire will soon be issued. Target one is Labour\u2019s borrowing plans. Using estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, there\u2019ll be a campaign reminiscent of the famous tax bombshell posters from 1992. It will be directed at Labour\u2019s implicit plans to borrow \u00a3200 billion more. Target two will be Labour\u2019s opposition to the coalition\u2019s caps on benefits and immigration. Mr Osborne, in particular, sees these issues as possessing the potential to drive a wedge between Mr Miliband and Labour\u2019s heartland, blue-collar voters.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019ll be a focus on the Labour leader himself. I\u2019m reassured that the negativity won\u2019t be personal but it will focus on Mr Miliband\u2019s opposition to all of the coalition\u2019s big deficit-reducing measures.

This is how he replied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would be advocating ramping up where we are. How you do that, whether it is along the lines of what the Turks have suggested, which is you create zones of immunity \u2013 these are questions that we should debate.

The consequences of that will be very brutal and very bloody for all the people there.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the anti-Islamic film that has generated protests throughout the Muslim world was \u201claughable\u201d.</strong> When it was pointed out that Salman Rushdie had described it as \u201ccrap\u201d, Blair said: \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely right. The film is, it may be wrong and offensive, but it\u2019s also laughable as a piece of film-making.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Arab world faced a battle between \u201cthe forces of modernisation\u201d and \u201cvery powerful forces of reaction\u201d.</strong> (In the UK he used to call them the \"forces of conservatism\".) It was important for the forces of modernisation to win, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the end we need both the leadership within those countries and within Islam to stand up and say, \u2018Look, there is a proper modern way of reconciling religious faith, democracy in society\u2019, and we need ourselves from the outside to engage with this process of change in a way that\u2019s constructive.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the emerging democracies in the Arab world had to learn that democracy was a value system, not just an electoral system.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to be saying to people who are starting with their democracy: \u2018democracy\u2019s not just a way of voting, it\u2019s a way of thinking; the test of a democracy is how you treat the minority as well as how the majority comes to power'.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T11:53:24.363Z\">at 12.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5056d1b358f9cf283191bd92\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T07:45:48.859Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Michael Gove will be in the Commons at 3.30pm announcing details of his plans to replace GCSEs in England with a more rigorous exams.

  "<p>Five years ago, a young man by the name of Rob Delaney, 30 years old and living in California, was, by his own admission, having a bit of a tough time. He'd had tougher times for sure, having survived, in brutally quick succession, alcoholism, a near-fatal drink-driving accident and severe depression, but this was definitely another challenge. He'd recently walked away from a well-paid job where he had \"an office in a skyscraper\" to devote himself to standup. \"And I immediately went into abject poverty,\" he recalls. Like many before him, he discovered that comedy, as a career, is not always a&#xa0;load of laughs.</p> <p>Half a decade later, Delaney is one of&#xa0;the sensations of the US scene. He <a href=\"http://www.thecomedyawards.com/categories/viewers-choice/twitter/\" title=\"\">regularly tops audience polls</a>, and has an enormous, devoted following. When it was announced that he would do a week of shows in London next month, tickets sold out in an hour.</p> <p>How all this came to be can be summed up in one word, a very simple one and, in Delaney's eyes, a slightly embarrassing one: Twitter. Delaney is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robdelaney\" title=\"\">huge on Twitter</a>, so much so that he can refer to himself, without a wince, as \"a content provider\". As I write, he has 600,000 followers, though it will doubtless be many more by the time you read this, and he has accrued them&#xa0;in just three years; he joined the site in 2009 when he realised it was \"a wonderful joke delivery mechanism\". His tweets, which range from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/237255446514241536\" title=\"\">the political</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/242026938208755712\" title=\"\">the puerile</a>, have gained such traction that his comments about Mitt Romney, portraying the presidential candidate as a square, stupid bigot (\"Ha ha ha! Terrific! \u2013 Mitt Romney, every time Jar Jar Binks appears on screen\"; \"Healthcare should be decided by individual states, cuz y'know, Texas cancer is like, different from Colorado cancer? \u2013 Mitt Romney\") are more popular than Romney's own tweets, according to <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-02/mitt-romneys-twitter-nemesis\" title=\"\">Business Week</a>.</p> <p>So Twitter has been good to him, enabling him to live his dream. But when we meet in a London hotel, Delaney \u2013 a handsome bear of a man with a demeanour that oscillates between deadpan and thoughtful \u2013 is ambivalent about the blogging service. Not once does he check his smartphone; his eloquence and enthusiasm dims when I drop the T word.</p> <p>\"I feel silly about everything that's happened from it. I'm happy, of course, because I was doing standup for a while and pursuing all the traditional angles, and Twitter's just rocketed me to a whole new level.\" But he talks in the jaded tones of one who has wearied of the virtual world: \"You and I will be around a lot longer than Twitter, and nothing substitutes face to face. I use Twitter as a tool to get involved with people, to sell tickets to gigs where I can stand in a room and smell the audience \u2013 and I love that! I want to smell them. Not each of them individually because that would be against the law \u2026\"</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://buy.louisck.net/\" title=\"\">Louis CK</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/chris-rock\" title=\"\">Chris Rock</a>, two of the greatest US standups alive today, Delaney's delivery is fast but brilliantly structured, profane but deeply moral, with none of the lazy misogyny or stereotyping too many comics use as a crutch. I went to see him earlier this year in Washington DC, green about what to expect, and could hardly speak afterwards, I was so winded from laughing.</p> <p>It's also very different from his Twitter feed, far more personal and less&#xa0;obviously political. \"With Twitter, you just want to make people laugh in their meeting; on stage, people have paid for their tickets with their hard-earned money so I owe them the truth as I experience it,\" he says. \"Plus, if I&#xa0;have&#xa0;to do the same show 100 times, I&#xa0;have to care very much about what I'm talking about.\"</p> <p>One of the many things he cares very much about is women's pubic hair. Specifically, the preservation of it. \"Oh yeah, definitely, but forgive me if I don't make eye contact with you while I talk about this because I do consider myself a gentleman,\" he says, which, coming from the man who frequently sends jokily salacious tweets to the pop star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\" title=\"\">Adele</a>, is as surprising as his self-distancing from Twitter. \"I mean, Jesus Christ, hair suggests sexual maturity, which I find attractive, as a lot of men do. But we have these big companies like Proctor &amp; Gamble, trying to sell products by making people feel bad about themselves, and they train their cannons more on women. And that, to me, is fundamentally wrong. It's a sin. I want people to feel good about themselves.\"</p> <p>Delaney was born in Boston and grew up wanting to be an actor. After graduating from college in New York, he moved to Los Angeles where he was somewhat sidetracked by alcoholism, a problem that came to an end when he was 25 and ploughed a car into the LA Department of Water and Power. \"When I came back into consciousness I asked the doctors and police if I had killed anyone, and I thought, if they say yes I'll wait until I get left alone and I'll kill myself, and if they say no, I am not drinking any more. They told me no, and I have not drunk or done any drugs since.\"</p> <p>He spent 24 hours in jail, and the judge gave him a choice between a prison sentence or rehab. He chose the&#xa0;latter. He also, at that point, decided to devote his life to comedy, \"because when I felt that I had a second chance I wanted to laugh and make people laugh.\" Then, a year later, he was walloped with depression. \"I think during that first year I was like, 'I can't believe I'm alive!' But then I let my defence mechanism down and went into a very bad depression in which I seriously considered suicide,\" he says, talking a little slower and lower. \"My depression was much more pummelling than the alcoholism because, with alcoholism, you can push away the feelings of horror by getting drunk. You don't get that with depression. Instead, it was a voice telling me, all day and all night, 'Kill yourself. Kill yourself.' \"</p> <p>Eventually, he went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed medication. The depression returned a few years ago when Delaney tried to cut down, and he has \"now achieved peace\" with the idea of being on tablets for the rest of his life. Being married and becoming a&#xa0;father, with one young child and another on the way, also helps, \"because it takes you out of that loop of selfishness in a wonderful way\".</p> <p>\"Depression taught me the importance of compassion and hard work, and that you can overcome enormous obstacles,\" he says simply. \"But also the importance of what's real. That's what matters.\" His iPhone, I notice, remains firmly in his pocket.</p>",
  "<p>Two years into the coalition, the attack on employment rights is gathering pace.</p> <p>The government have already made it more difficult to claim unfair dismissal: an employee now needs two years' service instead of one before they can bring a claim. This was no great surprise - it was two years from 1980 to 1999, when Labour reduced it to one year.</p> <p>Then they considered doing away with unfair dismissal claims altogether and replacing them with \"no fault dismissal\" ie fixed compensation for dismissal, at a much lower level than present, without any need to establish unfairness. This was suggested in a <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/r/12-825-report-on-employment-law-beecroft.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> by the venture capitalist and Wonga investor Adrian Beecroft who happens to have given over half a million pounds to the Conservatives in the last five years.</p> <p>Now they tell us they will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/14/unfair-dismissal-compensation-cap-cut1\" title=\"\">not bring in \"no fault dismissal\"</a>, but they still propose to slash the amount of compensation payable for unfair dismissal. The latest proposal was announced last week and in true \"hang 'em first and try 'em after\" style, the government now purports to consult on this idea even though it is already set out in a <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/enterpriseandregulatoryreform.html\" title=\"\">government bill</a> which has already passed nearly all of its stages in the House of Commons.</p> <p>For full details of that proposal, see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/24/unfair-dismissal-compensation\" title=\"\">the piece I wrote back in May</a> but to summarise, the proposal is to reduce the maximum compensatory award from \u00a372,300 (at present) down to median pay (\u00a326,000) or one year's pay, whichever is lower. (The bill gives the power to enact a multiple of 1, 2 or 3 times median pay, but it is pretty clear this government would go for the lowest).</p> <p>So the cap on compensation would be slashed by two thirds, more for low earners, because half of all workers earn less than \u00a326,000. For someone who earns only \u00a315,000, the cap would be \u00a315,000.</p> <p>It is true that the median award is less than \u00a35,000, and only a small number of awards are affected by the present cap. But still it is grossly unfair for those who are. I had a client who had worked for his employer for 38 years. He was entirely blameless in his dismissal. The tribunal ordered reinstatement and the employer refused to comply. He had found other work but due to pension loss his net loss was assessed at \u00a3121,000. His award was capped at \u00a353,500 (the limit then in force). I cannot see why his employers should not have been made to compensate him properly. It was open to them to reinstate him and then his losses would have been tiny in comparison. They chose not to. If the cap goes down to \u00a326,000 we can expect to see a lot more cases like that. It's a licence to treat people badly and still pay less.</p> <p>But equally unjust is the other change being introduced: from next year, anyone who wants to bring any claim in the employment tribunal will have to pay a fee to issue the claim and a further fee to proceed to a hearing. For bigger claims such as unfair dismissal or discrimination the total fees will be \u00a31,200. There can be no doubt the aim is to deter claims, and the fees will undoubtedly present an insurmountable hurdle for many claimants.</p> <p>None of this will make it easier to fire employees (and supposedly therefore to hire them, as claimed); it will just make it cheaper. But that's what the Conservative Party's backers want. And it seems the Liberal Democrats are happy to go along with it.</p>",
  "<p>The days of self-regulation of newspapers in Ireland could be numbered after the justice minister said he would revisit privacy legislation, following the decision by the Irish edition of the Daily Star to print pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing topless.</p> <p>In a strongly worded statement on Monday afternoon, Alan Shatter said he was going to return to Ireland's 2006 Privacy Act to \"consider what changes should be made\" and then \"progress its enactment\".</p> <p>He added that despite the existence of a press regulator \"some sections of the print media are either unable or unwilling in their reportage to distinguish between 'prurient interest' and 'the public interest'\".</p> <p>The threat is a blow to the Irish newspaper industry, which battled to stave off statutory regulation in 2003 and in the end successfully negotiated with the government to set up a regulatory system based around the independent Irish Press Council and a press ombudsman.</p> <p>Shatter's remarks were made two days after the co-owner of the Irish Daily Star, Richard Desmond, threatened to close the paper following the decision to print the photographs, which have led to criminal proceedings for alleged breach of privacy in France, where they were first published on Friday by Closer magazine.</p> <p>Such is the success of the regulator that it was frequently hailed as a potential model for Britain in the Leveson inquiry into press ethics, offering a regime that delivered decisions on complaints that was both independent of newspaper editors and had legal standing because of a statutory underpinning it was given at birth.</p> <p>Shatter said the decision by some sections of the print media to breach privacy \"detrimentally impacts upon the lives of both public personalities and private individuals and it seems that no value of any nature is attached to an individual's right to privacy.</p> <p>\"It is perceived financial gain, as opposed to any principled freedom of expression, that for some is the dominant value. The publication by the Irish Daily Star in Ireland of topless photographs of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, is a clear illustration of this,\" he said, adding that some titles believe public figures are \"fair game\" and have no right to privacy.</p> <p>\"What is needed is balanced legislation that does nothing to inhibit proper investigative journalism, the reporting of news and the expression of opinion on issues of genuine public interest in a manner that respects the ethos and values of a constitutional democracy, but which also prevents the abuse of an individual's human rights and flagrant violation of an individual's right to privacy.\"</p>",
  "<p>The first licence for a large-scale cull of badgers in England was issued on Monday, allowing the animals to be killed over a 300 square-kilometre area in west Gloucestershire.</p> <p>The government hopes it is the first of many licences and that the death of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/19/badger-cull-bovine-tb-spelman\" title=\"\">estimated 100,000 badgers</a> will help curb the scourge of TB in cattle, which led to 26,000 cows being slaughtered in 2011.</p> <p>Asked if the granting of the license was a positive first step in a nationwide roll out of the cull, the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, said: \"Yes, I very much hope so.\" Badgers can carry bovine TB but the scientists who led lead of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\" title=\"\">decade long trial of culling concluded it could make \"no meaningful contribution\"</a>, and was \"not an effective way\" to control the disease.</p> <p>\"In pursuing this nonsensical policy, the government appears to have scant regard for scientific evidence, animal welfare or wildlife protection, and is betraying farmers with a bloody and pointless slaughter that will not solve their problem,\" said Mark Jones, veterinarian and executive director of Humane Society International. HSI has lodged a complaint against the government with the Bern Convention, a European treaty to protect wildlife. The Badger Trust has also pledged to pursue any legal route to challenge culling licences.</p> <p>Paterson, a strong supporter of the cull, said: \"I want to see a prosperous, healthy badger population living alongside healthy cattle. We would all like to have a vaccine but we have not got one. So we should use the measures used effectively in other countries to bear down on the disease in wildlife and in cattle.\" The previous Labour government said an oral badger vaccine would be ready by 2015. The coalition cancelled five of six trials of injectable vaccines, and said a viable oral vaccine was \"years away\".</p> <p>The RSPB said on Monday that they would be vaccinating badgers on its land at Highnam Woods in Gloucestershire, which lies just outside the newly licenced culling zone. \"The dairy industry has endured terrible times while trying to cope with this devastating disease,\" said the RSPB's Martin Harper. \"However, we have never been convinced that the best way to help farmers is to force them to foot the bill for a contentious cull that is only expected to reduce outbreaks by about 16%. This is a lot of effort for a small gain. Bovine TB needs tackling properly and we believe vaccination offers the best hope for cattle, badgers and the industry.\"</p> <p>The decade-long trial indicated that if heavy culling was continued for years, then a 16% drop in bovine TB cases could be seen. But the new culls will use a different killing method and the cull in Gloucestershire, and one expected in Somerset, are intended to test whether the less expensive shooting of free-running animals is as effective as the cage-trapping and shooting used before.</p> <p>The issuing of the <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2012/170912.aspx\" title=\"\">licence by Natural England</a>, revealed by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/16/badger-cull-government-go-ahead?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">Guardian on Sunday</a>, means the group of farmers and landowners can cull over a continuous six-week period every year for the next four years and have to kill at least 70% of the local population. \"Maximum numbers will be specified to prevent the risk of local extinction,\" said a statement from Natural England.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/12/activists-disrupt-bager-cull\" title=\"\">Animal rights campaigners are determined to halt the trials</a> through protests at the cull sites, whose location is not being made public.

  "<p>Nigerian police have killed a spokesperson of the radical Islamist group Boko Haram, one of a handful of publicly known members of the group whose insurgency has left hundreds dead this year alone.</p> <p>Abu Qaqa was shot after trying to flee a military checkpoint near Mariri, on the outskirts of the northern capital, Kano, two security officials told the Guardian. Mariri has been an important launchpad for Boko Haram operations in the Muslim-dominated north, the sources said.</p> <p>Security agents trailed a battered Volkswagen car as it left Mariri just after dawn. \"When the car was stopped the three men inside said they were taking a woman with them to hospital. One of the men attempted to flee and was shot. It was the woman who confirmed to us that Qaqa was the one trying to flee,\" a military source said.</p> <p>He said two other men, one of whom was a senior ranking member, were transferred to custody in the capital, Abuja.</p> <p>Officials hesitated to confirm the death publicly, saying they had to be sure of the man's identity. In January security agents announced they had arrested Qaqa, before backtracking.</p> <p>Public knowledge of Boko Haram has hinged largely on Qaqa's interviews with selected journalists. In his last contact with the Guardian, Qaqa said the group was struggling to release two planned videos with security agents on their trail.</p> <p>The US stepped up the counter-insurgency training it provides to Nigeria after a series of church and mosque bombings killed 150 people in the new year. Attacks have subsided in recent months after the president replaced his top security adviser with a colonel from the Muslim north, Sambo Dasuki.</p> <p>Presidential aides said Dasuki had picked up talks that faltered with the group in March. \"The mere fact of being a northerner himself means he can reach out to the group in a way that wasn't possible before,\" a military commander said.</p> <p>Sporadic violence has continued. At least 12 people were killed this weekend after running gun battles between Boko Haram and the military.</p>",
  "<p>British arms exports should be subjected to prior scrutiny by MPs and the risk that the weapons could be used for internal repression must be assessed much more effectively than in the past, two leading members of Labour's shadow cabinet have told the Guardian.</p> <p>A radical shift in Labour's policy on the arms trade, with tougher controls, and greater transparency and accountability, is spelt out by Douglas Alexander and Jim Murphy, the shadow foreign and defence secretaries.</p> <p>\"The Arab spring has fundamentally recast the context in which domestic and international security policy is conducted \u2026 a nation's arms-exporting policy represents today one of the most profound ways in which a country can influence events beyond its borders,\" they say.</p> <p>The Arab spring put the spotlight on Britain's arms export policy as official reports revealed that the government approved substantial exports of weapons \u2013 including guns and ammunition, as well as crowd control equipment \u2013 to Muammar Gaddafi's Libya, Hosni Mubarak's Egypt, and Bahrain, months before those governments violently repressed popular uprisings.</p> <p>The British government subsequently revoked 158 arms export licences to those countries. However, it resumed arms sales to Bahrain despite a continuing crackdown against protesters.</p> <p>\"At present the risk assessment used to determine the legitimacy of an export licence relies too heavily on retrospective assessment, primarily taking in to account evidence of a government previously having breached specific criteria,\" Alexander and Murphy say in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/uk-progressive-arms-policy-arab-spring\" title=\"\">joint article published on the Guardian Comment is free website</a>.</p> <p>\"If the Arab spring has shown us anything,\" they add, \"it is that perceived past stability is no guarantee against future volatility.\"</p> <p>The government should adopt more pre-emptive risk assessments, placing more emphasis \"on social, political and economic drivers of conflict\", they say.</p> <p>The previous Labour government increased parliamentary scrutiny over arms export licences but it was limited to reviewing ministerial decisions after they had already been taken. \"What is still lacking in the UK system is a method for prior scrutiny,\" say the shadow foreign and defence secretaries.</p> <p>\"Lessons could be learnt here from our allies. In Sweden there is an expert advisory body, headed by an independent official responsible for oversight of export licensing, which advises on delicate pre-licence decisions \u2013 before a minister has made the final call. And in the US, Congress is given prior notification of all foreign military sales over specific cost-thresholds planned for the following year and can object ahead of the government making a decision.\"</p> <p>Though Alexander and Murphy say any system of prior scrutiny must not delay decision-making, it could be an important step in increasing transparency and accountability.</p> <p>They accuse the coalition government of \"jettisoning of the leadership position bequeathed to them\" on proposals for a global arms trade treaty, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/ga/67/agenda/\" title=\"\">on the agenda of the UN general assembly this month</a>. The government's position contributed to a stalemate in negotiations in July in New York, they say. What was needed was an agreement that was \"transparent, legally binding, and [applying] to all existing and future transfer agreements\".</p> <p>Vince Cable, the business secretary, admitted to a committee of MPs earlier this year: \"We do trade with governments that are not democratic and have bad human rights records \u2026 we do business with repressive governments and there's no denying that.\"</p> <p>He was giving evidence to the Commons committee on arms export controls whose chairman, the former Conservative defence minister Sir John Stanley, accused the government of adopting a \"rosy-tinted\" and \"over-optimistic\" approach to authoritarian regimes.</p>",
  "<p>In Berlin, on the third floor of an old courtyard building on Oranienstrasse, is a little-known institution called the Museum der Dinge \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.museumderdinge.org/actual_state_of_affairs/\" title=\"\">Museum of Things</a>. As its name may already suggest, it consists essentially of one long room full of, well, stuff. There are pots and pans, crockery and cutlery, cigarette cases, telephones, vacuum cleaners, rubber ducks, hamburger keychains, you name it. It's the material culture of Germany in the 20th century stuffed into glass-fronted cabinets.</p> <p>The visitor's first response may well be to wonder what story, exactly, is being told here. How are these objects classified, and what does that classification tell us about the history of German society, or at least German design? It's not instantly clear, but once you start reading a series of lengthy wall texts, you'll be sucked into a Manichean world where every object is either good or evil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396309831\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/9/17/1347891408789/Wasserkocher-electric-ket-010.jpg\" alt=\"Wasserkocher (electric kettle), Museum of Things, Berlin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wasserkocher (electric kettle) at the Museum of Things</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The backbone of the collection is the output of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Werkbund\" title=\"\">Deutscher Werkbund</a>, the association of architects, designers and manufacturers that modernised Germany. Founded in 1907 and functioning in some form until the 1960s, except for a spell when the Nazis closed it down, the Werkbund was one of the driving forces of European modernism. It was also almost certainly the single greatest attempt to indoctrinate a nation with the principles of good design \u2013 principles that consumers all over the world still espouse, whether they realise it or not.</p> <p>For the Werkbund, design was quite simply a moral issue. Its members believed in the probity of what they called \"good form\", which \u2013 as anyone familiar with Adolf Loos's 1908 essay <a href=\"http://www.ariadnebooks.com/productinfo.aspx?productid=1572410469\" title=\"\">Ornament and Crime</a> will know \u2013 was honest, mass-produced and undecorated. And in their pursuit of good form, they felt it necessary to identify what bad form looked like. From the perspective of our more liberal times, this is where the Werkbund ideologues start to sound like a bunch of extremist nutters. Gustav Pazaurek, for instance, created a Department of Aesthetic Aberrations. Also known as \"the torture chamber of bad taste\", this collection of 900 objects \u2013 crafty items, kitsch souvenirs and decorative objets d'art \u2013 was supposed to serve as a lesson in what not to do, and what not to buy. For the Werkbund, with its catalogues of sanctioned good taste, was nothing if not didactic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396309832\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/9/17/1347891229181/Serviettenhalter-Museum-o-010.jpg\" alt=\"Serviettenhalter, Museum of Things, Berlin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Contrasting designs for Serviettenhalter (napkin holders) at the Museum of Things</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This binary opposition between good and bad design runs through the heart of the Museum of Things. And so you have plain teacups and glassware juxtaposed against decadent, decorative ones. Modernism's thin blue line \u2013 electric kettles designed by <a href=\"http://www.behrens-peter.com/\" title=\"\">Peter Behrens</a> for AEG, and products with brand names like Ideal, Standard and Universal \u2013 faces off against an army of kitschy beer steins and bourgeoisified vases. This culminates in what is, for me, the most appealing (and most cartoon-like) television ever designed: <a href=\"http://midcenturymodernfreak.tumblr.com/post/25407199793/hf1-tv-herbert-hirche-for-braun-1958-source\" title=\"\">Herbert Hirsche's HF1 for Braun</a>, a grey box with just one central button. I think we can safely say that the Werkbund won the argument. What is Apple, whose minimalist aesthetic is so influenced by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/dec/04/dieter-rams-design-museum\" title=\"\">Dieter Rams</a>'s products for Braun, if not a descendant of the Werkbund bloodline?</p> <p>The problem was that, in its battle against the seductions of style, all the Werkbund could offer was a different style, and an authoritarian one. By contrast, the other cabinets in the museum, which contain the rest of the collection and are full of the stuff of everyday life \u2013 from Nivea pots and soapboxes to plastic animals and breast-shaped mugs \u2013 possess a humanity and often a humour that is free from moralising and aesthetic tyranny. In an age when we all fancy ourselves individuals, we are more suspicious of Werkbund-style (or even Apple-style) orthodoxies. And a younger generation of Germans coming of age in the 1950s and 60s \u2013 while the Werkbund was still proselytising \u2013 felt the same, demanding objects with more fun and more emotional attachment than the sanitised world of \"good form\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396309833\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/9/17/1347892433016/Radio-at-the-Museum-of-Th-010.jpg\" alt=\"Radio at the Museum of Things, Berlin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radio at the Museum of Things</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But one of the most compelling aspects of the museum, for me, is its name. Why \"things\" and not \"design\"? \"We're not a design museum, we're about the production of commodities,\" says its chief curator, Renate Flagmeier. This is a curious statement, because almost every object in this place has been designed in some way or other. Yet the name is precisely what drew me here. It reminds me of Martin Heidegger's observation that in many European languages the word \"thing\", or \"ding\" in German, was originally the same as the word for an assembly or gathering (the parliaments of Denmark and Norway are still called the Folketing and Storting). So a \"thing\" gathers meanings and memories in it, and is also something to be debated.</p> <p>The Museum of Things sounds a tad mundane, but what more appropriate name for a museum where every object is part of a moral and political debate? Heidegger divided the world into \"things\" (more likely to be hand-crafted) and \"objects\" (more likely to be machine-made), arguing that \"things\" were more authentic. It's a rather romantic division, but it happens to apply quite neatly to the Werkbund's objective, machine-loving worldview \u2013 even if its members would have been outraged by the philosopher's conclusion.</p> <p>More interesting than such classifications, though, is the idea that a thing \u2013 a plastic hamburger on a keychain, say \u2013 exists to be debated. How many of us today believe that our taste reflects on us morally? And yet such prejudices still exist, even at the governmental level. Take any of the objects here from the former East Germany. They don't especially jump out, but if you look carefully at this selection of thermoses and radios, they do show subtle signs of belonging to a world cut off from the latest fashions and manufacturing techniques. While products from behind the Iron Curtain have long been the butt of jokes, a revisionist Ostalgie (or nostalgia for the East) looks more fondly on them these days. But at least we can make up our own minds about them, right? Well apparently not. There is a much more comprehensive collection of design from the GDR in Berlin, but it's not on display. It's called simply the <a href=\"http://www.gfdg.org/netzwerk/sammlungen/\" title=\"\">Industrial Design Collection</a>, and the government won't fund it.</p> <p>\"The government is trying to control memory,\" says the design historian Andreas Ludwig, who joined me at the Museum of Things. \"The GDR is always portrayed as a dictatorship, and they prefer not to relive that moment of German history \u2013 the west won, basically.\" Indeed, his own institution, a documentation centre for designs from East Germany, is on a watch list of cultural venues that may lose their funding next year. Berlin's local authorities will happily fund art but less so design \u2013 and, it seems, especially not design that recounts the political traumas of the nation.</p> <p>Design, the message would seem to be, is dangerous. Who'd have thought it \u2013 all this aesthetic moralising and political controversy in a place called, simply, the Museum of Things?</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 September. It originally stated that the Museum of Things is on a watch list of cultural venues that may lose their funding next year. This has been corrected</p>",
  "<p>Fears of a trade war between the United States and China intensified on Monday after Barack Obama launched action at the World Trade Organisation to stop Chinese auto industry aid from threatening jobs in the key electoral battleground state of Ohio.</p> <p>With growth and jobs seen as vital in the race for the White House, the administration said it had begun a case at the WTO in Geneva against what the White House said were illegal export subsidies for cars and car parts.</p> <p>The ratcheting up of the trade tension between the world's biggest and second biggest economies prompted immediate tit-for-tat retaliation from Beijing, which announced its own WTO case against the US.</p> <p>Trade experts said the tougher approach taken by Obama came as little surprise given the high level of unemployment. No president since Roosevelt in the 1930s has won an election with the jobless rate as high as 8.3% and the labour market has proved particularly weak in the so-called rust belt states of the midwest.</p> <p>\"Export subsidies are prohibited under WTO rules because they are unfair and severely distort international trade,\" US trade representative Ron Kirk said in a statement. \"China expressly agreed to eliminate all export subsidies when it joined the WTO in 2001.\" </p> <p>Obama's decision to adopt a more aggressive approach towards China followed accusations by Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger in the presidential race, that the president has been too soft in the face of repeated violations of global trade rules. </p> <p>China's export-led growth model has resulted in a trade surplus averaging $25bn a month in 2012, attracting criticism from manufacturing lobbying groups and unions.</p> <p>Jobs in the US auto parts sector dropped by roughly half between 2001 and 2010, while US imports of auto parts from China have increased seven-fold, according to the Obama administration.</p> <p>Ohio, one of the most important of the six swing states likely to decide this year's tight race for the White House, depends heavily on the auto industry, which was bailed out by Obama following the savage global downturn of 2008-09. Polls show that Obama has a slight edge in Ohio.</p> <p>Scott Paul, executive director of the American Alliance for Manufacturing welcomed the administration's move. </p> <p>\"The facts in the case are indisputable. China is subsidizing its auto parts sector, blocking our exports, and causing significant harm to workers and businesses in our nation,\" he said. \"Our auto assembly sector, now back on its feet, could be undercut by China's cheating, causing irreparable damage to the heart of America's productive economy.\" </p> <p>The WTO confirmed that the US had filed a case against China and that the two sides would now have a 60-day cooling-off period in which to seek an agreement. If the talks fail, a panel will be set up to decide whether US jobs had been outsourced as a result of subsidies that unfairly cut the cost of Chinese exports.</p> <p>Sources said that in high-profile cases involving the WTO's bigger members consultations often resulted in failure, and Beijing responded swiftly to the action taken by Obama by challenging measures adopted by the US to prevent the dumping of cheap Chinese goods, including kitchen utensils, steel, tyres, wood flooring, magnets and paper.</p> <p>China has already won one WTO case against the US over its use of anti-dumping measures, which forced Washington to bring in new laws designed to be compliant with global trade law. Beijing today said that the new US law was also in breach of WTO regulations and affected exports worth more than $7bn.</p> <p>\"Chinese enterprises in an uncertain legal environment, in violation of the relevant rules of the WTO transparency and due process,\" a spokesman for China's ministry of commerce said.</p> <p>Obama and Romney have both pushed China to the forefront as they seek to refocus their campaigns after a week dominated by foreign policy and the protests at US embassies across the Arab and Islamic world.</p> <p>Tough action on China is one of the few foreign policy positions Romney has pushed in the campaign so far, claiming Obama's weak response has harmed US workers. The president has countered with claims that Romney has investments in Chinese companies and outsourced jobs to China while running the private equity firm Bain Capital.</p>",
  "<p>Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel raised the stakes in his confrontation with the city's teachers' union on Monday as he launched legal action to force teachers back to work.</p> <p>City attorneys <a href=\"http://www.catalyst-chicago.org/notebook/2012/09/17/20429/cps-files-injunction-against-strike#.UFdA3H8tFaQ.twitter\">asked a judge to declare the strike illegal</a>, claiming it endangers the health and safety of students and contravenes a new state law that has ostensibly outlawed strikes over issues like evaluations and rehiring.</p> <p>\"This was a strike of choice and is now a delay of choice that is wrong for our children,\" Emanuel said in a written statement. </p> <p>The judge has sought to delay making a decision until Wednesday, which may obviate Emanuel's legal strategy if the delegates ratify the agreement tomorrow.</p> <p>The legal move marks an intensification in a dispute most thought was winding down over the weekend after both sides said they had reached a framework they were comfortable with for agreement. </p> <p>Last week ended with the expectation that schools would be open on Monday. That was the outcome union leader Karen Lewis said she was \"praying for\" and that one school board member said would only be prevented by something \"nutsy\" happening.</p> <p>The week-long strike has received the overwhelming support of the city's parent,s although finding alternative arrangements for the 350,000 students has caused difficulties. It centred on the extensive use of testing for teacher evaluation and the right of teachers who have been fired from school closings to be rehired.</p> <p>The agreement had reached a compromise on testing and agreed that teachers with good evaluations who have been laid off would be rehired when vacancies came up.</p> <p>\"I'm hard-pressed to imagine how they could have done much better\", Robert Bruno, a professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told the Associated Press. \"This is a very impressive outcome for the teachers.\"</p> <p>But when union negotiators presented the new contract to their house of delegates for ratification on Sunday the delegates asked for more time to read it through. \"There's no trust for our members of the board,\" Lewis said Sunday night. \"They're not happy with the agreement. They'd like it to actually be a lot better.\"</p> <p>The deliberation pushed the first possible day children could return to school to Wednesday \u2013 delegates will not meet until Tuesday because of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Delegates will meet with rank-and-file teachers over the next 24 hours to discuss the deal.</p> <p>There were mixed feelings on the picket line at one north side school on Monday&#xa0;\u2013 as several cars continued to honk their support \u2013 about the delegates' decision to delay. There is little trust between teachers and city hall and so they understood the need to read over the contract carefully before signing off on it. </p> <p>Most believed that the deal the negotiators have agreed is good, although the prospect of an extensive wave of school closings has made many wary. But there was also concern that further delay beyond Wednesday might test both the support of the public and the unity of the union. The response to Emanuel's legal threat was a mixture of disbelief and derision.</p> <p>Anecdotally at least parents remain sympathetic to the teachers and say they understand why teachers are taking their time.</p> <p>\"As much as we want our kids back in school, teachers need to make sure they have dotted all their i's and crossed their t's,\" said Becky Malone, mother of a second grader and fourth grader, who have been studying at home and going to museums over the last week. </p> <p>\"What's the point of going on strike if you don't get everything you need out of it? For parents, it'll be no more of a challenge than it's been in the past week.\"</p>",

They&#xa0;had done the Forth Road and the&#xa0;Severn, both suspension bridges \u2013 but, with a total span of 2,220m, or almost a mile and a half, the Humber was going to be the longest suspension bridge in&#xa0;the world. Nowadays you've got computers, but back then everything was done on slide rules and calculators. The towers were concrete rather than the usual steel, since concrete was cheaper and would blend in better with&#xa0;the setting.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mclp9QmCGs\" title=\"\">Gallopin' Gertie, as the Tacoma Bridge in the US was nicknamed, collapsed</a> just four months after it opened in 1940 because it started to bounce in the wind. Not only was the Humber lighter, it was designed to&#xa0;move \u2013 but the wind caused us problems, too. There were 15,000 half-centimetre-thick wires in each of the two suspension cables. These were taken across the water on a giant spinning wheel. Imagine: two cables hanging between the towers with a lateral wind \u2013 they got blown all over.</p> <p>One Friday night, one of the gantry cranes plunged down and hit the deck underneath. I think I broke Usain Bolt's record running away from it. One man was seriously injured, and two 120-tonne box-road sections were left swinging about. But on the Monday morning we managed to rotate them into position. Anyone watching wouldn't have noticed a thing, though.</p> <p>We&#xa0;got a bad press, largely because inflation of 26% distorted the financial predictions. The bridge opened with a&#xa0;debt of \u00a3150m \u2013 basically, the cost now of three Chelsea centre forwards \u2013 then interest rates took this to \u00a3330m, which successive governments have partly written off. But this is something that's designed to stand for 120 years. How can you put a price on that?</p> <p>When the Queen opened it in 1981,&#xa0;the Red Arrows did a fly-past. Unfortunately, the Archbishop of York had added an extra verse to his prayer of dedication \u2013 and the Red Arrows flew past right in the middle of it.</p> <p>I live on the north bank and can see the bridge from my house. I don't use it too often. I have to pay the toll.</p> <h2><strong>Malcolm Stockwell, bridgemaster</strong></h2> <p>The bridge was still being built when I&#xa0;took up my post and I quickly met with resistance. I couldn't understand why people would object to a bridge, but there was very little history of traffic between the two banks. The fishing industries on north and south were competing with each other and declining. People said it would be a bridge from nowhere to nowhere.</p> <p>I gave the ferry workers jobs collecting the tolls so they wouldn't be out of work, but the toll itself proved very unpopular. <a href=\"http://www.visithullandeastyorkshire.com/\" title=\"\">Hull council</a> were constantly arguing to have the charge lowered, but the Treasury said no.</p> <p>At first, nobody seemed interested. Then kids started visiting. I'd show them the control room, all the lights, and they were astounded. Then I'd meet people who lived in towns on opposite banks a mile apart for whom the journey previously might as well have been to the moon. The bridge brought them together.</p> <p>It held the record for the world's longest&#xa0;suspension bridge for 16 years. Although it can't beat <a href=\"http://www.visitingdc.com/san-francisco/golden-gate-bridge-picture.asp\" title=\"\">the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco for setting</a>, it far outstrips it for sheer elegance and as a piece of engineering. I live in Barton, on the south bank, and see it from my window. I use it twice a week and it still moves me.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission has conceded its plans to force mandatory quotas for women on EU company boards have run into stiff British-led resistance that could wreck the idea.</p> <p>Viviane Reding, the justice and rights commissioner, delivered proposals earlier this month that would force listed companies across Europe to ensure that 40% of non-executive board seats were occupied by women, as opposed to under 14% at present.</p> <p>Britain spearheaded the opposition, assembling a blocking minority with eight other countries who wrote to Reding and the commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, last week strongly criticising plans for legislation that has not yet been drawn up.</p> <p>The opposing countries argued that they were not against mandatory action to impose bigger female quotas on company boards, but that the issue should be left to national governments and not legislated at the European level.</p> <p>The commission said on Monday that it was not dropping the plan, but still fine-tuning the draft legislation. The European imposition of women's quotas enjoys backing in the European parliament which will have a strong say in deciding the issue. Reding may be hoping that she can muster enough support in the parliament to challenge the national governments and force them to back down.</p> <p>\"European laws on important topics like this are not made by nine men in dark suits behind closed doors, but rather in a democratic process with a democratically elected European parliament,\" Reding responded to the letter.</p> <p>Britain was joined by the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Malta in opposing the move. Although Germany did not sign the letter, it is also understood to be against European regulation of the issue.</p> <p>Reding wants the 40% quota to be operative by 2020.</p>",
  "<p><strong>BSkyB</strong> will prove the big winner in new streaming services offered to consumers, according to City analysts, despite <strong>BT</strong>'s current push into the home entertainment market.</p> <p>Exane BNP Paribas said Sky's strength in programme - from films to sport - would give it an advantage despite BT winning the rights to various football and rugby events.</p> <p>Exane's Michael Williams raised his target price for BSkyB from 850p to 920p, saying:</p> <blockquote> Sky's model of reinvesting growth back into securing more exclusive content, so enriching the proposition and driving further growth, was looking challenged as the subscription market matured (programming costs outpacing subscription revenue growth). Over-the-top [streaming services] adds a new opportunity to drive growth from the established cost base \u2013 it has the potential to reinvigorate the model. Those looking to challenge the established order face an up-hill task. </blockquote> <p>He cut his target for BT from 270p to 250p and moved from buy to neutral:</p> <blockquote> BT has secured around 250 hours per annum of sports content for \u00a3280m a year \u2013 add production and conditional access costs and 3.7m customers at \u00a310 a month will be needed to cover this commitment. BT must now invest in more content - but Sky has the vast majority of its rights secured through 2015. How compelling, and at what cost 'BT Sports'? </blockquote> <p>BSkyB closed 5p higher at 725p, while BT dropped 4.8p to 228.2p.</p> <p>Overall investors paused for breath after last week's rises, which had been inspired by news of a further round of quantitative easing from the US Federal Reserve and an easing of Spanish and Italian bond yields. With renewed anxiety about a Spanish bailout sending yields higher again and worse than expected US manufacturing data, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 22.03 points lower at 5893.52.</p> <p>China growth worries hit commodity shares, with <strong>Evraz</strong> down 9.7p at 284p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> falling 65.5p to \u00a332.16.</p> <p><strong>Admiral</strong> fell 5p to \u00a311.18 as Espirito Santo issued a sell note on the insurance group, based on the outlook and the prospect of investors selling up to invest in the forthcoming Direct Line flotation. The broker said:</p> <blockquote> Admiral's business model is highly geared to growth yet the first half demonstrated how the company is coming under increasing pressure from softer UK insurance pricing, regulatory change and most importantly in our view, a decision to rein in volume growth. With turnover and pretax profit growth slowing to 7% in the first half, consensus of 12% growth for the second half looks too aggressive to us and the 13 times PE multiple still implies a growth stock yet growth seems to be disappearing. As an income stock the 7% yield is attractive, but similar yields are available elsewhere in the sector at cheaper valuations. <br> From a technical perspective the imminent IPO of Direct Line will bring selling pressure to the UK property and casualty insurance names (\u00a31bn new free float expected) and with Admiral's revenue and margins under pressure this would appear to be a good time to take profits. </blockquote> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> lost 2.2p to 173.65p following reports it might be planning to make a $2.2bn provision against possible Indian tax liabilities.</p> <p>In January the mobile operator won a court ruling against the Indian government's demand for payments relating to the company's purchase in 2007 of Hutchison Whampoa's operations in the country. Following the defeat, the Indian government amended the law to apply it retroactively, which could yet leave Vodafone liable.</p> <p>The company had so far resisted setting aside a provision for any potential tax bill, but chief financial officer Andy Halford told Bloomberg it may change its mind.</p> <p>But <strong>Unilever</strong> added 23p to \u00a322.68 after UBS raised its recommendation from neutral to buy and its price target from \u00a322 to \u00a324</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Communications</strong> climbed 1.72p to 38.25p after it confirmed earlier reports that Bahrain Telecoms was in talks to buy the company's assets in Monaco &amp; Islands in a deal said to be worth around $1bn.</p> <p><strong>Chemring</strong> rose 2.4p to 348.4p, awaiting bid developments. US private equity group Carlyle has received an extension until 12 October to decide whether or not to proceed with a bid for the defence company. Weekend reports suggested that Invesco, which holds more than 29% of Chemring was holding out for 450p a share.</p> <p><strong>Man</strong>, the hedge fund group which has been under pressure in recent months on worries about its growth prospects, added 1.1p to 89.6p on revived bid talk. Traders suggested possible US interest - again - with a price of 150p a share mentioned.</p> <p><strong>Ophir Energy</strong> fell 33p to 608p despite a positive update on its drilling programme in Equatorial Guinea. Over the weekend came reports that Tanzania's energy minister had ordered a review of all contracts with oil and gas explorers operating in the country. Ophir chief executive Nick Cooper said:</p> <blockquote> Ophir has a track record of leading the exploration of offshore Tanzania, with six discoveries from six wells to date, and is fully compliant from an operational and regulatory perspective in all of its Tanzanian licenses. Ophir welcomes the review process and, with the re-commencement of drilling in early October, looks forward to another high impact drilling programme. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Ocado</strong> dipped 0.45p to 73.6p after Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon again raised the prospect of the online grocer breaching one of its covenants. In a sell note with a 50p price target, he said:</p> <blockquote> The third quarter is unlikely to have seen sales growth accelerate and this means that it is possible that Ocado could breech its net debt to EBITDA covenant this year. Consensus for net debt to EBITDA for 2012 is 3.2 times versus the covenant which requires it to be below 3.5 times and our forecast for 4.4 times. It all looks a little tight. However, the company remain publicly confident that there will be no breech, with the chief executive labelling those who speculate to that effect as 'foolish' as recently as the 18 August in The Sunday Telegraph. <br> [But] standing alone against the largest retailers in the country with a pile of debt and falling market share isn't sustainable. A starting point for the valuation of the company will be its net asset value, which is 33p, including 53p of non-current assets. We remain sellers with a target price of 50p because, although we now believe that Ocado's days as a public company are limited, we don't think that the equity is worth very much. </blockquote>",
  "<p>When Jos\u00e9 Mourinho replaced Roberto Mancini at Internazionale in 2008, the tension between them was acknowledged without being explicit. They weren't jilted lovers, rather rivals in a complex love triangle \u2013 with Inter at the centre.</p> <p>Mourinho encounters constant problems with his partners' exes \u2013 at Real he has criticised Manuel Pellegrini's efforts. \"Second place? It's just the first loser,\" he scoffed before Pellegrini returned with M\u00e1laga. Mourinho invited him into the Real dressing room but the Chilean didn't want to glimpse his former companion's new relationship.</p> <p>Previously, Mourinho had launched an even nastier war with his Chelsea predecessor Claudio Ranieri. \"They [Chelsea] wanted to win and it was never going to happen with him,\" he sneered. \"It is really not my fault if he was considered a loser.\" Again, the \"losing\" was second place.</p> <p>Few stand up to him. \"Everyone has their own way of thinking, being and acting,\" Pellegrini said. \"I'm different, as I like respect and I give respect,\" Ranieri said. \"He shows no respect to other coaches,\" complained his predecessor at Porto, Oct\u00e1vio Machado. None defended their league position; Mourinho was the only one speaking of sloppy seconds.</p> <p>But Mancini is different. He won three consecutive Serie A titles, so the \"loser\" tag doesn't fit, and Mourinho's criticism was more sheepish. \"I don't see Mancini's shadow over me,\" he insisted at Inter. \"I'm indifferent to it.\" When criticising others, it was all-out attack \u2013 against Mancini he parked the bus. Mancini even dares to take credit for Inter's success under Mourinho. \"Did I build the foundations? I built the roof too!\" he claimed. \"The most difficult thing is to start a cycle. The rest follows as a consequence.\"</p> <p>But Mourinho won the Champions League, Mancini's achilles heel. The Portuguese coach has triumphed twice, while Mancini couldn't manage a semi-final at Inter. This meeting, in Mourinho's backyard, in Mourinho's competition, is a huge challenge for Mancini.</p> <p>These are similar coaches \u2013 keen tacticians who demand caution and share a deep mistrust of inconsistent wingers. They've had some interesting battles: in their Uefa Cup meeting 10 seasons ago when Mourinho's Porto beat Lazio 4-1 on aggregate. \"They played a 4-5-1 in the first game, then switched to three at the back for the return leg!\" raved the Portuguese. \"They [Italians] think of football in relation to the opponent, and change the way they play accordingly.\" It takes one to know one.</p> <p>Both have become more proactive \u2013 as they overthrew their biggest rival to win the title last season, But Real and City were too frantic and vertical for European competition. City were unsuited to the tempo, lacking a steady passing midfielder, hence the purchase of Jav\u00ed Garc\u00eda. Real lacked control away at Bayern Munich in last year's semi, when Mesut Ozil made forward darts from midfield but was overshadowed by Bayern's Toni Kroos, who sat deeper while Bayern outnumbered Real in the centre. In response, Mourinho signed Luka Modric. To win this competition, both must create a more mature team with their new loves.</p> <p>They've had their excitement, they've scored plenty of goals, now it's time for something more meaningful. \"This is not Mourinho versus Mancini, this is Real Madrid versus Manchester City,\" the Italian said \u2013 but he knows, deep down, this one is personal.</p>",
  "<p>I want to begin by making a confession: I like it when novelists are dead. I find it pleasant to hold a novel in my hand and to know that its author is no longer among us. The spontaneous sympathy I then feel for both text and writer is even a little bit more heartfelt if the book is out of print; if I had to get hold of it secondhand from one of those dubious online dealers who offer as-new copies so cheaply that the cost of delivery exceeds the now no more than symbolic cost of the book itself.</p> <p>I always read a novel which has become that cheap to the end. I feel an almost personal obligation to do so. I keep going to the very last page, even if it can't really grip me and push against my limits; even if I begin to fear that it was never, even when it was written, a good book. Then I put it in the wastepaper sack along with the newspapers of the last few days. It's a little like laying to rest a mummy that was displayed, undignifiedly and for far too long, in a museum. The memory of this good deed is the last future which, for a little while at least, we will share.</p> <p>I know that this feeling has something to do with the way I imagine the past of the novel. If I don't shy away from a megalomaniac sense of vertigo, I am briefly able to imagine the totality of all the novels ever written: thousands upon thousands of manuscripts, of which many \u2013 presumably only a minority, but still a mighty host \u2013 have become books, lingering for a time in libraries or other memories until they too disappear into nowhere.</p> <p>The history of literature tries to control this vortex of time. Where there's a twisting maelstrom of production and destruction, it claims to recognise stable linearity: beginnings; development; opposition and gain; sometimes something new, better even. Progress without end. The history of the novel \u2013 at least the history of the European novel \u2013 then turns into a tree whose growth we can supposedly reconstruct. This oak rises from the fertile soil of older narrative forms. At some point a separate sapling emerges from the epic thicket. The wood of the trunk grows stronger and harder; gradually the tree becomes aware of the tradition it forms, but also of unrealised possibilities. Grown stately and proud, it forks into powerful branches. Its youngest twigs reach further towards the light; towards new, not yet explored kinds of writing.</p> <p>I like this illusion. I enjoy the idea that I could know what is old and what is new, that I understand how the new emerges from the old. Like every illusory control of time it can help one to keep going, if one submits to it at the right moment. But there is also the fatally wrong moment. I remember a young author telling me about her collision with the history of the novel. She had written her first work of prose, a slim, autobiographical volume, in the finest enthusiasm of na\u00efve creativity. Before she tackled a proper novel, she simply wanted to see just what had been written so far. She asked experienced readers for help and drew up a list. No more than a selection from, supposedly, the most important German-language novels of the 20th century, 20 or 30 titles.</p> <p>She began in chronological order. What had been conceived as an instructive game turned into a nightmare. She had entered the forest of literature in order to collect a few fine mushrooms for her basket. But she was forced to realise that a giant mushroom rhizome ran through the gentle grove from one end to the other. A network of dead fibres, but also of damp living ones. Not everything that strove towards the light there was in good condition: much was maggot-eaten, there was much ugly rank vegetation, above all far too much iridescent beauty. In the young writer, however, the emotional surplus of yearning, anticipation and fear, the many-armed dream-catcher, which her future novel had been, shrank away into despondency and resignation.</p> <p>A pity! With a little luck things could have turned out differently. From the experience of frightening greatness she drew the fatal conclusion that whatever there was inside her, driving her to write a novel, was embarrassingly small. The shock of greatness prevented her from achieving what experienced readers spontaneously succeed in doing time and again: the fusion of one's own creative system with the structure of the text; the magnificent identification of a reading consciousness with the imagined world of the novel; the flight into a wonderful and vast expanse.</p> <p>That could be called escapism. And there are spatial metaphors that suggest themselves to describe the experience. But someone who escapes into a novel is also escaping from a particular time. Every habitual reader \u2013 the genre junkie just as much as the lover of subtle language games \u2013 senses and enjoys the fact that he is escaping that time which is constantly being presented to him as the really important, decisive one. This deceitfully dominant time format could perhaps be called \"small time\" in contrast to the grand experience of time in the novel.</p> <p>This small time has something to do with our everyday lives. And its dogmatic champions maintain that dealing with daily life prevents us from squandering our always-scarce hours on reading \u2013 never mind writing \u2013 novels. An old, threadbare reproach. But who can feel so certain of himself in this respect? A few weeks ago I was talking on the phone to an author; almost 40, his latest novel was about to appear. I thought our conversation was going to be all about this happy forthcoming event, when he abruptly asked me what kind of nursing care insurance I had. At the moment he felt tormented by the thought that in the future, in 30 or 35 years, he might be at the mercy of the infirmities of old age without appropriate support. His son would then find himself in the terribly awkward situation of having to take care of a poor, invalid writer, one perhaps even suffering from dementia.</p> <p>A few days later I started reading his new novel. I can no longer say how many pages it took before I forgot the nursing care insurance cover, but it was quite a few. On the unusually difficult way into the promise of time of the novel, I felt that what prevented my immersion was a kind of future. It's not the presence of everyday life, its demands and duties that stand in the way of experiencing a novel. On the contrary: every genuine reader knows the special pleasure that comes of escaping into the time of the novel in the middle of everyday life, in the middle of the automatically prolonged present of errands, of getting things done. No: not the present but a particular kind of future \u2013 a feeling of apprehension, a specific anxiety, indeed cowardice \u2013 appeared to me to be the time-enemy of the novel.</p> <p>So I don't believe those people who claim that unfortunately they don't have any time to read novels, never mind write them, although in fact they feel strongly drawn to do one or the other or both. Out of a mistaken sense of consideration I don't say to them: it's only your small future that stops you dedicating yourself to the bigger time of the novel. The fact that you don't allow yourself to push against your own limits is a great pity, because it's precisely the experience of the novel that could help prevent your soul being soured by too much small future.</p> <p>Four years ago, the literary editor of a newspaper asked me whether I would like to contribute to a series in the arts pages of the publication. Its title was \"The Future of Yesterday\". Short essay-like texts were supposed to discuss utopian novels of the past 300 years. I was very taken by the idea, because I looked forward to reacquainting myself with texts I had read for the first time decades before. Most of the titles that involuntarily came to mind were so-called science fiction novels from the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>Fortunately the editor didn't expect me to consider whether they contained forecasts that had subsequently come true in technology, politics or society. Only the cheap know-it-all attitudes of those born too long after would throw themselves at these novels to explain that they told of gadgets, social orders and forms of rule that have not (or perhaps even have) become contemporary reality. Indeed, I didn't feel in the least that the technological, social or political environment around me would have been the future of these novels. I doubted that these authors, like members of some literary-military special unit equipped with telescopic sights and laser pointers, had been aiming at our 21st century.</p> <p>Admittedly, as genre literature, the majority of these books had in some formal aspects satisfied the expectations of genre readers. Probably the vain desire to predict something that could still come true in the lifetime of the author had played a limited part in the writing. But this prognostic ambition had evaporated from the space of reading like some initially overpowering but ultimately fleeting perfume. How liberating to enter into the apocalyptic visions of these novels without the possible nuclear war between the USSR and the US forcing itself into one's mind. How fascinatingly open to fantasise about a fictitious cyberspace and its obscure matrix without having to see this fictitious system and its world as representatives of yesterday's or today's internet. How good, not to be the posterity of these novels.</p> <p>Relieved of all prognostic expectations they seemed to me to have gained in scope. And my reading profited in more than a futurological way from the character of our contemporary shared world: if I am not deceiving myself, then in recent decades a certain pressure of expectation has very much diminished. The novel no longer has to provide the guiding thread linking a historically tamed past with a critically comprehended present, a string of knots by which one is then supposed to feel one's way forward into the already looming future.</p> <p>I know there are phenomena which distract from this liberation of the novel. Even when I'm writing I often don't feel as free as the present-day novel actually is. The demons of small time know all about my diffidence and regularly lead me into temptation. It's not so long ago that an agency that looks after the media advancement and public future of its clients called me up. A very energetic young man got to the point right away. They had heard that my prose texts had an interesting closeness to science and technology. They had read random samples. I was the right man. An important client \u2013 a well-known German scientist, the cutting edge of medical-biological progress personified \u2013 was looking for someone who could relate in an attractive way what his research team had discovered and which was about to cause a sensation. I should immediately look at the client's Wikipedia entry. The agency had brought it right up to date.</p> <p>The Wikipedia article was very long, fairly well written and just easy enough so that with my chance bio-chemical and medical knowledge I was able to follow it. All cleverly and skilfully done. What could this established and eminent authority expect from me? The future was quickly told. Planned was a bestseller: that is, one with sales figures in the six-digit range. I asked for examples, and my caller had them at his fingertips. To my surprise these included not only popular non-fiction books but also downmarket fiction. As a professional, I would no doubt immediately appreciate that the future quite evidently lay in the fusion of up-to-date scientific topics with narrative forms of presentation. Time was short. It would be best if I could provide a written sample as soon as possible. An introductory chapter. The relevant material had already been prepared.</p> <p>In the meantime I know what I should have replied: you're mistaken, I'm not an expert provider of narrative services. I am not an expert at all. I am a very dogged amateur in the field of experiencing big time. I don't believe in the continuous progress of science; I think that the natural sciences, especially medicine, are, just like literature, a maelstrom of production and annihilation. Consequently, in common with many authors, I love doctors as literary figures. I doubt whether the latest equipment and approaches are always better than yesterday's machines and abandoned procedures. I can certainly see that there is change. But I think that most of what we encounter as new is a surprising variation on and combination of older, more or less well-remembered or even quite forgotten elements. I enjoy the phenomenon of \"novelty\" as an invigorating feeling, as hormonal agitation, but I am far from wanting to make a bony fetish of whatever's new. I would probably not buy the book that I'm supposed to write for you. And if I got it as a present and began to read it out of curiosity it would probably bore me to death. Of the many forms of future, of the expectations, longings, fears I have so far fallen victim to, the future you have in mind is among the most inhibiting. If it were to become dominant, this future-obsession would cannibalise everything that I find hopeful about writing.</p> <p>Of course I didn't say any of that. Its not often that I make grand statements on the phone. I merely said: \"I'm really sorry. Thank you very much for thinking of me. But the imaginary scope of a possible novel has begun to absorb me. It will be called 'The Future of Mars' but have almost nothing to do with what you imagine as the near future of 'science' and 'fiction'. We've simply got a small time problem here, a time problem among contemporaries. But you can certainly call me again in one-and-a-half, in two or two-and-a-half years!\"</p> <p>That time is up. That future is over. The nervous young man never called me again. I finished my novel in June of this year. The book on which I was supposed to collaborate as a ghost-writer was considerably faster. It never became a bestseller. One can now buy copies online for 99 cents plus postage. I am afraid that the experience of big time can make one arrogant towards other forms of the experience of time. Perhaps I should order a copy and read it right to the end as slowly and devoutly as possible and then also lay this narrative mummy to rest in an appropriately dignified manner.</p> <p><strong>This is a translation of Georg Klein's keynote speech at the International Literature Festival Berlin.

His actions have discredited the police service and undermined public confidence in it.</p> <p>\"PC Harwood has accepted that it would be impossible for him to ever again serve as a police officer, whether within the MPS [Metropolitan police service] or any other police force \u2013 we agree, as we consider it inconceivable that he could ever perform a role in the police service again.\"</p> <p>Harwood, whose long and at times murky prior disciplinary record was not disclosed at his trial, would be sacked with immediate effect, Bennett said. However, he will keep his pension entitlement as he has not been convicted of a crime.</p> <p>Tomlinson, 47, died shortly after being shoved to the ground by a riot policeman later identified as Harwood. An inquest last year ruled that Harwood unlawfully killed him, but a trial jury acquitted the officer of manslaughter in July.</p> <p>The disciplinary panel, sitting in public for the first time in the Met's history, was initially going to try to reconcile these contradictory verdicts by ruling on whether Harwood's actions contributed to Tomlinson's death, even inadvertently, but this element was removed after representations from the officer's lawyers, dismaying Tomlinson's widow and children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396280707\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/7/16/1342451781714/Ian-Tomlinson-and-PC-Simo-005.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Tomlinson and PC Simon Harwood\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A video still showing Harwood pushing Ian Tomlinson prior to his death.

The conflicting verdicts of the inquest and criminal court still need to be resolved. We haven't given up; we will now be looking to the civil courts for the final judgment on who killed our dad.</p> <p>\"Who killed Ian? We know,\" King added. \"It's just a question of getting them to own up.\"</p> <p>Addressing the panel earlier in the one-day hearing, Patrick Gibbs QC, representing Harwood, 45, said the officer had twice offered to resign from the force, firstly after the inquest and then after the trial.</p> <p>\"He thought that that was the right thing to do,\" Gibbs said. \"He wanted to minimise further embarrassment to the Metropolitan police service.\" Both offers were refused, the lawyer added.</p> <p>Gibbs added: \"As far as the use of force, he completely accepts that the force he used was completely unnecessary.\"</p> <p>However, Gibbs said, any decision on whether Harwood's actions killed Tomlinson would be \"gratuitous and provocative, designed to provoke a retrial of Mr Harwood on charges on which he has already been acquitted\".</p> <p>Tomlinson died shortly after Harwood struck him on the leg with a baton and pushed him to the ground as he tried to make his way home past police lines following a day of protests connected to the G20 summit.</p> <p>An initial postmortem examination said Tomlinson, who was a long-term alcoholic, died of natural causes.</p> <p>But video footage, handed to the Guardian by a witness to the incident, revealed Harwood's actions, and two further postmortem examinations said the cause of death was internal bleeding caused by Tomlinson falling to the pavement after the push.</p> <p>The jury at the manslaughter trial was not told details of Harwood's past record, notably that he quit the Met on health grounds in 2001 shortly before an earlier planned disciplinary hearing into claims that he illegally tried to arrest a driver after a road rage incident while off duty, altering his notes retrospectively to justify the actions.</p> <p>Harwood was nonetheless able to join another force, Surrey, before returning to serve with the Met in 2005. He also allegedly punched, throttled, kneed or threatened other suspects while in uniform in other incidents. Most of the complaints were unproven.</p> <p>It is only the second time the Independent Police Complaints Commission has instructed police to hold a disciplinary hearing in public following a law passed in 2008.</p> <p>The only other public hearing concerned officers accused of failing in their duty when they did not respond to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/nov/16/ukcrime.gender\" title=\"\">repeated calls from Colette Lynch, a young woman in Rugby, Warwickshire, about threats from her ex-partner</a>.

Taking the template of their debut and refining it is key here and it is as much an album of space as it is sound.</p> <p>Lyrically it's the scribblings from the pages of a broken\u2013hearted teenage diary written by a philosopher, and musically it can only be described as hauntingly minimal. Soft beats and even softer keys are barely present among the breathed vocals. This is trip hop turned down to one, and makes Massive Attack sound positively fast.</p> <p>Unfortunately if you didn't like their debut chances are you won't find anything here that will change your mind. That said, it is better and more mature, like they have grown into their own sound and claimed it with confidence.

Delivered with the enthusiasm of an evangelist preacher, the phrase is repeated \u2013 like a mantra \u2013 to us, the congregation, and from this moment forth, self-conscious man-in-the-big-suit Byrne has lost control. Narrative, reason, meaning \u2013 it seems \u2013 holds no value for this government man. All he wants is to breathe. And the band, conveniently, provide the perfect soundtrack for a world in which rhythm, that most primal of musical instincts, reigns supreme.</p> <p>Over the course of eight tracks, Talking Heads \u2013 with the assistance of producer-auteur Brian Eno \u2013 blend funk, post-punk and African music into an intoxicating and irresistible sonic soup. And by the end of The Great Curve, with its frantic vocal arrangement and driving percussion, the listener has been grooved into submission, with Byrne as witness: \"She is moving to describe the world / she has messages for everyone / she is moving by remote control / hands that move her are invisible\". And as each line is punctuated with \"Night must fall now, darker, darker\", the song transforms into a primordial nocturne. Fewer than two years later, fellow art-rocker Peter Gabriel would attempt to capture some of that accompanying paranoia through Carl Jung's experiences in Africa. But it wouldn't have been the music of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7w1SrtNwHc\" title=\"\">The Rhythm of the Heat</a> that made Jung \"lose control\" to the rhythm that has his soul \u2013 it would be Remain in Light.</p> <p>If all great albums need an accessible way in \u2013 something to cling on to in all of the confusion and ineffability of new artistic experience \u2013 then the minor UK hit Once in a Lifetime may boast such a virtue. Still a staple on rock-oriented radio, Byrne's tale of the everyman finds him returning to role of preacher, disconnected and cast adrift on a sea of existentialism. \"You may find yourself\", Byrne lectures, \"in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife. And you may ask yourself, well: how did I get here?\" The influence of Brian Eno is impossible to miss, with the Roxy Music man even sharing a writing credit, and the fractured phrases forming this midlife crisis owe a significant debt to Eno's own approach to lyric writing. Musically economical and consisting of only two sections, the song steers the album away from the obvious buoyancy of the first three tracks to a more ambivalent and downbeat second half. But for Byrne, it's simply the \"same as it ever was...\"</p> <p>\"He would see faces in movies, on TV, in magazines, and in books...\" begins Byrne, underpinned by one of the albums most sparse and economical grooves, on Seen and Not Seen. As the music drifts, Byrne's account of the ideal image \u2013 and the constant pursuit of it \u2013 is greeted with the introduction of a vocal melody, ascending and descending with the ease of folksong to barely discernable syllables. The effect is haunting, and makes for the album's subtlest moment. Not as subtle, however, and arguably the most conventionally narrative of all of Byrne's lyrics on the album, is the eerie Listening Wind. Again, the link with Peter Gabriel is brought to the fore, whose own take on the song materialised as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ2omdkdk2k\" title=\"\">Arvo P\u00e4rt-inspired orchestral version</a> on 2010's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/feb/04/peter-gabriel-scratch-back\" title=\"\">Scratch My Back</a>. Gabriel's choice is a blatant one, and in this post-9/11 world of paranoia and American imperialism, both versions take on frightening and poignant new levels of relevance and complexity.</p> <p>So what else to make of Remain in Light in the 21st century? The postmodern aesthetic, which no doubt inspired many of the musical and lyrical directions taken on the album \u2013 particularly by Bryne and Eno \u2013 seems to constantly linger; at once both outdated and irrelevant yet perpetually meaningful in our fractured and now almost entirely digital age. Byrne's everyman may no longer be worried about ending up in a beautiful house with a beautiful wife: such existential questions do not bother him in a world in which the promise of capitalism holds little reality for those other than the divinely ordained bishops of our consumerist cathedrals. But our experience of reality, with most of us unaware of what \u2013 if any \u2013 reality it is that we are plugged in to, remains nauseating and deeply suspicious. \"Find a little space, so we can move in-between\". And more than 30 years on, Remain in Light may still be able to offer such a promise.</p> <p>\u2013 Ian Patrick</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/album/f39bdee4-9afc-425a-a009-6e32646c479d\" title=\"\">Life Is People by Bill Fay</a></h2> <p>Bill Fay \u2026 If Bob Dylan, Warren Zevon, Peter Gabriel and Randy Newman were to donate DNA and put them into one person, this is what we would have.

  "<p>A landmark case that could affect the fate of forests across Sweden reaches its final stage today in the supreme court.</p> <p>Environmentalists have warned that a damaging precedent will be set if Finnish company Nordkalk is allowed to carry out large-scale limestone mining in an ancient, biodiverse habitat on the northern Swedish island of Gotland.</p> <p>The planned limestone quarry would destroy part of Ojnare forest and neighbouring wetlands, a region that borders two protected areas and is so valuable that the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to turn it into a national park.</p> <p>\"We have species and habitats here that are not present anywhere else in Sweden, and in some cases not on the entire planet,\" says Nils Hallberg, a lawyer at the agency. Protected animals in the area include the large blue butterfly and Montagu's harrier, a bird of prey.</p> <p>Environmental groups have appealed to the supreme court in a last-ditch attempt to halt the mining after Nordkalk was given the go-ahead by a lower Swedish court in July this year.</p> <p>Supreme court judges will be presented with evidence from both sides today, and must decide over the coming days whether to take on the case.</p> <p>Tensions have run high in recent weeks, with activists chaining themselves to machinery to stop trees being felled, and protests including candle-lit vigils held in nine Swedish cities. \"People are very upset,\" said Elisabeth Wanneby, a member of campaign group Save Ojnare Forest.</p> <p>The main legal criticism in this case, that has been contested since 2006, focuses on the impact of the four kilometre-long and 25 metre-deep quarry on two nearby \"<a href=\"http://www.natura.org/\" title=\"\">Natura 2000</a>\" EU-protected areas, that are designed to safeguard Europe's most valuable species and habitats.</p> <p>\"We do not think that Nordkalk has presented enough scientific evidence that these protected areas will not be harmed by the work,\" said Hallberg.</p> <p>Environmental groups are concerned that mining could pollute and deplete the groundwater system that runs between the two nature reserves directly under the proposed quarry.</p> <p>They also fear for the area's unique wildlife. More than half of the world's rare yellow flower called <a href=\"http://www.nordkalk.se/default.asp?viewID=1928\" title=\"\">Gaffelfibbla</a> (<em>Pilosella dichotoma</em>) is reportedly found on the site proposed for mining.</p> <p>Carl Schlyter MEP, vice-president of the parliamentary committee on the environment, public health and food safety, has written to Janez Poto\u010dnik, the European commissioner for the environment, asking him to step in and stop the \"irreversible damage\" to this \"pristine area\" and \"safeguard the protected habitats\".</p> <p>The Swedish EPA says that if the large quarry is built it will not be able to turn the area into a national park as planned, opening the door for further mineral exploitation in the area. It could also set a precedent for similar developments near protected areas, and bring Swedish law in conflict with EU regulations, according to the agency.</p> <p>A statement by Nordkalk said: \"Before the permit was granted, a comprehensive environmental assessment \u2026 [was] performed.</p> <p>\"There will naturally be certain interference in nature because this kind of an industrial plant cannot be build [sic] otherwise. But that is what we have got the permit for. We will not wipe out any endangered plants from the island, destroy any drinking water or touch the Natura 2000 areas.\"</p> <p>There is no date set for the supreme court's decision on whether to take up the case. If the judges accept the case they are expected to halt Nordkalk's work in the area until they have come to a conclusion, which could take months.</p>",
  "<p>When Spain's star bullfighter, Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s, took on six half-tonne bulls in the Roman amphitheatre at N\u00eemes, southern France, fans wept and critics hailed him as a god.</p> <p>His gory trophy haul of 11 ears and one bull's tail from a single afternoon's fight on Sunday made him one of the greatest matadors ever.</p> <p>The unusual pardoning of one of his bulls, deemed too noble and brave to kill at the end of the fight, added to the legendary nature of a bullfight that propelled Tom\u00e1s's face to the front page of El Pa\u00eds, El Mundo and other major Spanish dailies on Monday.</p> <p>\"Extraordinary,\" wrote Nobel prize winner Mario Vargas Llosa, who was among those present. \"I have never seen a bullring so packed, and the people so overwhelmed.\"</p> <p>\"Some of us wept at the sight of such excellence, of perfection,\" wrote El Mundo's respected bullfighting critic, Vicente Zabala de la Serna. \"I write this with sunny tears, blinded by emotion.\"</p> <p>Write-ups of the historic fight featured, like all such reviews, in the arts pages of newspapers which still treat the bullfight as culture, rather than sport.</p> <p>Tickets had long ago sold out for the rare opportunity to see one of the greatest living bullfighters face six bulls. Most bullfights see three matadors take on two bulls each but, as the beleaguered bullfight seeks salvation from an onslaught of criticism over cruelty and dwindling public funding in crisis-hit Spain, fans saw this exceptional fight as an opportunity to stem the anti-taurine tide.</p> <p>\"Catalonia is here!\" was one of the cries heard from fans who had crossed the border from Spain's northeastern region \u2013 where bullfights no longer take place \u2013 to watch a pastime that also has roots in southern France.</p> <p>The Catalonian parliament banned bullfighting at the start of the year in response to a popular petition, but opponents questioned whether the ban was about protecting animals or about identity politics, with nationalists and separatists seeking to differentiate the region from the rest of Spain.</p> <p>Tom\u00e1s, 37, fought at Barcelona's La Monumental bullring a year ago in Catalonia's last bullfight, bringing to an end what fans said were six centuries of bullfighting in the region.</p> <p>After Sunday's performance, critics agreed that Tom\u00e1s deserves a place in the pantheon of great matadors, alongside legends such as Manolete, Juan Belmonte or Gallito.</p> <p>\"Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s is an exceptional bullfighter, because of his control, his courage and his art,\" wrote Vargas Llosa in El Mundo. \"There have always been stars in bullfighting but Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s is different to them all.\"</p> <p>Tom\u00e1s has long been the darling of bullfight-loving artists and entertainers. He is also a favourite in southern France, which shares the tradition of bullfighting with Spain and some South American countries.</p> <p>In recent years the number of Spanish bullfights has fallen by a third as town halls, which used to fund many of them, have run out of money. Some 1,700 fights were registered in 2010, with about 7,000 bulls killed.</p> <p>But bullfighting has received a boost from the new conservative People's party government of Mariano Rajoy, which has allowed it to be broadcast live once more on state television. TVE, the national broadcaster, had not shown a bullfight for six years until it recently changed its code of conduct, which now allows bullfights to be shown during children's viewing time.</p> <p>Tom\u00e1s has only fought a few fights this season, keeping fans yearning for more opportunities to see their idol. \"The aim is to have only a few fights, making quality the most important thing and to generate expectation and excitement,\" his manager, Salvador Boix, explained recently.</p> <p>As Spain's most popular bullfighter, Tom\u00e1s is also believed to charge the most for his services.</p> <p>\"The obvious question now is whether fans in Madrid, Seville or Bilbao will be able to see anything similar,\" commented Andr\u00e9s Amor\u00f3s, the bullfight critic for the newspaper ABC. \"Perhaps, now that TVE is back in bullrings, it could be shown live for free, so that all Spaniards can enjoy it.\"</p> <p>But those who think Tom\u00e1s might save the bullfight from decline are worried that the exact opposite could happen. Rather than providing further legendary fights, rumours are spreading that the matador, who has already had one comeback, will retire definitively.</p>",
  "<h2>The NFC West is better than advertised</h2> <p>It has been easy to make fun of the NFC West lately. The division which some commentators took to calling the NFC Worst has not provided a Wildcard qualifier to the playoffs since 2004. In 2010 it became the first division in NFL history to be won by a team with a losing record.<br> Even when the San Francisco 49ers emerged to reach the Conference Championship game last year, some suggested that their 13-3 record had been inflated by playing six games against such feeble opposition. Old assumptions die hard. Few noticed how the Arizona Cardinals won seven of their last nine games, or acknowledged how hard the St Louis Rams had been hit by injury.</p> <p>A few more might be paying attention now, after a week in which the NFC West's representatives went a perfect 4-0. Arizona's victory was the most remarkable, the Cardinals ending New England's 10-year streak of always having won their home openers since moving to Gillette Stadium in 2002. The Patriots had a chance to win the game with a 42-yard field goal at the death, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YVla2cBS0&amp;t=0m54s\">Stephen Gostkowski would pull his effort wide of the uprights</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R9YVla2cBS0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R9YVla2cBS0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.<br>If that might seem like a tough break for New England then any other outcome would have been cruel on Arizona, who were on course for the win before running back Ryan Williams fumbled at his own 30-yard line with just over a minute to play. Arizona's defense, which sacked Tom Brady four times and intercepted him once, had been to the fore \u2013 as it has been since their upswing began last year. </p> <p>That is a testament to defensive co-ordinator Ray Horton, whose schemes have brought the best out of players such as defensive end Calais Campbell and helped make up for a woeful offense in which Kevin Kolb lost the job at quarterback within a year of joining on a $62m contract, yet now has it back after Josh Skelton went down injured. But it is perhaps also a sign of how the division is bucking league trends.</p> <p>Although Alex Smith has improved significantly under Jim Harbaugh, the 49ers have unquestionably built their success off the back of a ferocious defense at a time when big passing offence is supposed to rule all. The Cardinals and Seahawks have been following a similar model, the latter's defense suffocating an explosive Cowboys offense on Sunday. </p> <p>St Louis's young group, too, have an aggressive ball-hawking mentality, as evinced by four interceptions in two games against the Detroit Lions and Washington Redskins. They were good value for their win this week, even if they were eventually helped across the line by a <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/josh-morgan-takes-one-worst-penalties-nfl-history-001920046--nfl.html;_ylt=At_b5l_sBkXDFtdBAri2RQpYYsp_;_ylu=X3oDMTE5YXU0cDg3BG1pdANCbG9ncyBJbmRleARwb3MDMjgEc2VjA01lZGlhQmxvZ0luZGV4;_ylg=X3oDMTFpMm9iMzh1BGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdANibG9nBHB0A3NlY3Rpb25z;_ylv=3\">spectacularly foolish act of petulance from Skins receiver Josh Morgan</a>.</p> <p>San Francisco remain the cream of the division and perhaps still the only real contender among the group. But the notion that the NFC West will be whipping boys for the rest of the league is being rapidly disproved.</p> <h2>Taking a knee is a dangerous business</h2> <p>All eyes were on the pregame niceties at Candlestick Parck on Sunday, as fans waited to see if there would be a reprise of<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzfTC1XW_yQ\"> last year's handshake histrionics between 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh and his Detroit Lions counterpart Jim Schwartz</a>. But instead of San Francisco it was New York where tempers would fray, Giants head coach Tom Coughlin giving a piece of his mind to Greg Schiano of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as they met on the field after the game.</p> <p>Coughlin's beef was over the behaviour of the Bucs' defenders during a kneel-down play at the end of the game. NFL etiquette typically calls for defenders to stand and allow the offense to run such a play when lined up in the appropriate formation, but Schiano, in his first year as an NFL head coach, had instructed his players to crowd the line and fire off hard in the hopes of causing a fumble. </p> <p>Giants quarterback Eli Manning, whose remarkable 510 yards passing put him within three of the single-game franchise record held by Phil Simms, called it a \"cheap shot\", while Coughlin simply described himself as relieved that nobody had been hurt, but Schiano defended his perspective. \"I don't know if that's not something that's done in the National Football League,\" he <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/giants/behaving_badly_P6TkfArj7cmLs5wglT1VUM\">told the New York Post</a>. \"We fight until they tell us the game is over.</p> <p>\"There's nothing dirty about it, there's nothing illegal about it. We crowd the ball like a sneak defense and try to knock it loose. We're not going to quit \u2013 that's just the way I coach and teach our players. If some people are upset about it, that's just the way it goes. I don't have any hesitation. That's the way we play. We play clean, hard football until they tell us the game is over.\"</p> <h2>Tim Tebow is not a key component for the Jets</h2> <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have less than fond memories of Tim Tebow. Eliminated from last year's playoffs by a Tebow-led Denver, their fans greeted the quarterback's appearance on the field during their game against the New York Jets on Sunday with a hearty booing. The volume only went up as he broke off a 22-yard run on his first play.</p> <p>They did not have to boo for long, however. Tebow would stay in for the next two plays, handing off to Joe McKnight and Shonn Greene, before leaving the game again \u2013 not to return. On his one carry, Tebow had collected just one fewer yard than Greene managed on 11 attempts. The team's leading rusher, Bilal Powell, had just 33 yards from 10 attempts. For the second game running, Tebow was not asked to throw the ball. </p> <p>Rex Ryan's words afterwards spoke volumes, the Jets head coach blaming Pittsburgh's domination of possession for the fact Tebow was not seen more. \"We did put him in there \u2026 and he had a nice run and then we had another one with Joe and then we had a 6-yard loss,\" said Ryan. \"Obviously at that time you're out of it, and then by then we're doing several points, so I think we need to throw the ball in those situations.\"</p> <p>The idea of letting Tebow throw the ball, it seems, did not factor into Ryan's thinking. In the coach's mind, clearly, there can be no quarterback controversy \u2013 because Tebow is not a quarterback.</p> <h2>The Saints are in trouble</h2> <p>Perhaps head coaches are important after all. Two games into the season the New Orleans Saints, who went 13-3 last season under Sean Payton, are 0-2 \u2013 following up last weekend's home defeat to Robert Griffin III and the Washington Redskins with a 35-27 loss on the road to their division rival Carolina Panthers. The statistics are well-known. Since the playoffs expanded to 12 teams in 1990, only 22 of the 206 teams to start a season 0-2 have made the postseason.</p> <p>The odds feel even longer than that for a Saints team which has given up a league-worst 461 yards per game. If it felt as though New Orleans might gain some advantage against Cam Newton the Carolina Panthers from having already played against a mobile quarterback in RG3 the previous week, then that theory was quickly disproved as Cam Newton was allowed to pick up 71 yards and a score on 13 carries.</p> <p>If Payton's absence is being felt then the perhaps most troubling aspect of their start is that defensive co-ordinator Steve Spagnuolo, hired this summer to fix a defense which has been a postseason liability, is very much in place. A system which worked so well for Spagnuolo in New York, where he had the likes of Michael Strahan, Osi Umenyiora and Justin Tuck, has not been such a success with a less capable pass-rushing defensive line.</p> <p>Without Payton calling the shots, the offense has not been sharp enough to make up for their deficiencies. Then again, they might not be if he was present. As the New Orleans safety Malcolm Jenkins put it: \"Sean Payton couldn't come out and run a route. Joe Vitt couldn't make a tackle.\" </p> <h2>The NFL is not vetting replacement officials thoroughly enough</h2> <p>One of the weekend's big stories unfolded before a down was even played. On Sunday morning, just hours before New Orleans were due to kick off against Carolina, it emerged that one of the side judges appointed to officiate their game was a Saints fan. Not one who was shy about his allegiances either. Brian Stropolo had a number of pictures of him wearing Saints gear on his Facebook page.</p> <p>Stropolo was pulled from the game shortly before kick-off. ESPN reported that when they first got in touch with the NFL about the story,<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8386973/nfl-pulls-replacement-ref-new-orleans-saints-game\"> the league was still unaware of Stropolo's allegiances</a>. An article on NFL.com suggested that the eventual decision to replace Stropolo stemmed from a desire to: \"<a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000062384/article/replacement-official-pulled-from-saintspanthers-game-by-nfl?module=HP11_headline_stack\">avoid any storylines or excuses that could be related to potential in-game conflicts</a>\".</p> <p>The league has stated that the replacement referees are subject to the same background checks as its regular officials, but it is hard to imagine the NFL allowing such an appointment if they had known of Stropolo's allegiances. Had the oversight not been noticed in time, the potential for any marginal calls he made to been spun into hugely negative stories would be enormous.</p> <p>Nor was this the only apparent tale of insufficient vetting to emerge this weekend \u2013NFL.com's Albert Breer reporting on Sunday night that Jeff Sadorous, who worked Arizona's game against Seattle last week,<a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000062396/article/official-who-worked-seahawkscardinals-game-has-ties-to-seattle?module=HP11_headline_stack\"> had been employed by the Seahawks last season to officiate their practices</a>. The latter might be much more of a grey area than the assignment of a fan to his team's games, but only serves to reinforce a sense of poor organisation.</p> <p>The real source of frustration for fans, of course, is simply that the replacements continue to make important mistakes. The most glaring this week might have been in the Jets-Steelers game, when <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2012/09/16/ike-taylor-pass-interference/70000475/1#.UFaQco1mR48\">Ike Taylor was flagged for a pass interference on Santonio Holmes that was simply non-existent</a>. Or perhaps the calling of two separate two-minute warnings during the fourth quarter of the Philadelphia Eagles' win over the Baltimore Ravens.</p> <p>But it is the general, pervasive and constant low-level mistakes which are beginning to wear down players and coaches. After his team's defeat, Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco suggested that the officials were undermining the integrity of the game. And although such words could easily have come across as sour grapes, the truth is that he was right.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/schedules\">NFL scores</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/standings\">NFL standings</a></p>",
  "<p>The latest, dangerous standoff between Japan and China, which brought <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/16/chinese-protests-japanese-islands-dispute\" title=\"\">violent protests across China</a>, was sparked by Tokyo's decision to \"nationalise\" a chain of disputed, gas-rich islands in the East China Sea. But the row is just one manifestation of a deeper, multi-faceted, and almost institutionalised confrontation pre-dating the second world war. Coincidentally, Tuesday marks the anniversary of an infamous event that raised the curtain on the modern era of Sino-Japanese tensions.</p> <p>The Mukden, or Manchurian Incident of 18 September 1931, became the pretext for Imperial Japan's invasion of northern China. The dynamiting of a section of track belonging to the Japanese-owned South Manchuria railway near Mukden (now Shenyang) was blamed by Japan on Chinese insurgents. In truth, the Japanese military had itself deliberately staged the explosion, a tactic copied by Hitler before he attacked Poland in 1939. Within months, Japan had created a puppet state in northern China.</p> <p>A long, sorry history of conflict ensued, and many decades after Japan's defeat in 1945 Chinese commentators continue to complain that, unlike Germany, Tokyo has never fully come to terms with its wartime actions, let alone shown genuine remorse. Rows erupt periodically over the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which, in Shinto belief, houses the spirits or souls of soldiers who died fighting for the emperor. Past visits to the shrine by senior Japanese politicians invariably aroused Chinese fury.</p> <p>The sharpening dispute over the Senkaku islands, known as Diaoyu in China, is the most recent product of this old narrative of violence, hatred, fear and grief that continues, sporadically, to obstruct both nations in their efforts to forge a more stable, trusting relationship. But understanding its roots does not render it less potent. The Americans, who still view themselves as the Asia-Pacific's leading power, are increasingly nervous.</p> <p>Leon Panetta, the US defence secretary, currently visiting Japan, pointedly warned that \"provocative behaviour\" by either side could lead to misjudgments, violence and, potentially, open warfare. \"It is in everybody's interest \u2026 for Japan and China to maintain good relations and to find a way to avoid further escalation,\" Panetta said. In this he echoed Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, who this month stressed the need for restraint and dialogue between China and several south-east Asian countries with which Beijing has territorial disputes.</p> <p>China's unhappy legacy of foreign occupation and its sense that an unrepentant Japan is party to a US-orchestrated geo-strategic conspiracy to contain or limit its development as a great power also form part of the backdrop to the Senkakus standoff. While claiming he was not taking sides, Panetta confirmed in Tokyo that the islands were covered by the Japan-US security and defence treaty. That means, in theory at least, that Washington is bound to help Japan defend territory that China says has been illegally seized.</p> <p>The Obama administration's pivot towards Asia, its concern to defend itself and its friends against nuclear-armed North Korea, China's ally, and its active pursuit of expanded security and commercial alliances embracing countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia are all factors influencing the way China's leaders think about their country's security and relations with Japan, Washington's key regional partner and military springboard. When Clinton declared two years ago that freedom of navigation in the South China Sea was a US \"national interest\", Beijing viewed it as an outrageous provocation, just as it now views Tokyo's \"intolerable\" decision to purchase the Senkakus.</p> <p>When this or similar disputes have flared in the past, days of rage, such as were suffered by Japanese nationals living in China's cities at the weekend, have invariably been followed by gradual de-escalation and diplomatic fence-mending. The Chinese government's apparent ability to turn street protests on and off has often given an air of artificiality to such episodes. Hard-headed self-interest and pragmatic considerations, such as $340bn-worth of annual bilateral trade and the dreaded possibility (for the Beijing leadership) that Chinese street protesters might turn on their own government, usually prevail in time, and tempers cool.</p> <p>This time it may be different, mainly because of political shifts inside Japan. The Senkaku dispute has been close to the boil for months. The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, took the decision to buy the islands to head off a more destabilising but popular proposal not only to acquire them but also to begin their active development. China's reaction, including unleashing mass protests, sending ships to the area and threatening trade sanctions, was harsh but not unusual.</p> <p>Under pressure from nationalist opinion, Noda has taken a surprisingly inflexible public position: \"There can be no doubt that the Senkaku islands are part of Japanese territory, both under international law and from a historical point of view. The Senkakus are under the effective control of our nation, and there is no territorial issue with any country over the islands,\" he told the Yomiuri Shimbun in July. He is now calling on China to return to \"calm\" dialogue, without offering any concessions.</p> <p>\"The confrontation between Japan and China \u2026 has escalated to a truly dangerous level,\" wrote the former <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenharner/2012/07/17/the-japan-china-territorial-dispute-is-serious-and-escalating/\" title=\"\">US diplomat Stephen Harner in Forbes</a>. \"Objectively it must be stated that it has been Japan that has done the most to raise tensions. Further escalation cannot be in the interests of either side. While his [Noda's] leadership in domestic policy matters has generally been laudable, even brilliant, in relations with China on this issue he seems captive to interests that would lead Japan into a trap.\"</p>",
  "<p>The map of the football world is changing. A side issue of sad-gate has been the realisation that the wages of the world's best footballers are now so huge that there are a handful of clubs who can afford them. Were Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Real Madrid who, realistically, even with the enormous marketing potential he offers, could afford his wages?</p> <p>Manchester City, perhaps, although they seem to be retrenching. Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), certainly, although they are hamstrung by French tax rates. Manchester United? Chelsea? It's just about possible, although they aren't as free-spending as they once were. Not an Italian team. Not a German team. So that leaves China or the Middle East \u2013 or, assuming Ronaldo wants to stay in Europe, Russia, where there still appear to be any number of oligarchs willing to take on the Financial Fair Play regulations.</p> <p>In an otherwise fairly sedate last week of the transfer window, the startling move came from Zenit St Petersburg, who spent \u00a383m to land Givanildo \"Hulk\" Souza and Axel Witsel from Porto. Even Russians seem a little bewildered by Hulk's arrival. An interview in Sport-Express reminded the Brazilian that last year he had said he would only leave Porto for a \"great\" club. \"The most important thing for me right now is to do well in the Russian league, to take Zenit to first place and to help Zenit get as close as possible to the Champions League,\" he replied. \"These challenges come from a proposal the club from St Petersburg made to me. In addition, I had a lot of discussions with the president of Zenit and discussed everything with him.\"</p> <p>To which came the sceptical follow-up: \"But you have the feeling that Zenit are a big club?\" Hulk, diplomatically, said they are \"growing very rapidly\". Yet Hulk's first appearance saw Zenit fall from top spot to fourth as they lost 2-0 at home to Terek Grozny, who are the surprise leaders of the Russian league after eight games. Taken in isolation the game perhaps wouldn't be too worrying for coach Luciano Spalletti. His team faced well-drilled, well-organised opposition and ended up being undone by two late goals, both of which were largely the result of individual errors. But Zenit have now won just one of their last four games and there is a distinct sense of a side having lost its rhythm. \"I am disappointed with the home results but I am sure my team will alter the situation,\" said Spalletti. \"So I'm not worried. But, yes, we have to do a lot of hard work to improve.\"</p> <p>Zenit's style hasn't changed much since Spalletti took over three years ago. It's still the same, basic, 4-3-3 with Aleksandr Kerzhakov \u2013 a far better player than his wayward shooting at Euro 2012 suggested \u2013 flanked by Vladimir Bystrov and Viktor Faizulin. Assuming Hulk does force his way into the side, he would presumably play on the right, and there's still Danny to return on the left, giving Spalletti a wealth of options. Witsel, presumably, is seen as a long-term replacement for Konstantin Zyryanov in midfield alongside Igor Denisov and Roman Shirokov, but he has not travelled to Spain for Tuesday's Champions League group tie away to M\u00e1laga. The key to this game is probably whether Zenit's three in midfield can dominate M\u00e1laga's Ignacio Camacho and whoever replaces J\u00e9r\u00e9my Toulalan (plus whichever of their plethora of attacking central players is chosen to support whichever of the many centre-forwards they play).</p> <p>The biggest problem for sides from the east is the calendar. Although both Russia and Ukraine now run an autumn-spring season, the necessarily long, winter hiatus means a comparatively short break in the summer and so, by the time the Champions League groups reach their climax in November, the eastern sides have been playing for almost nine months with just a brief rest, while those from the west are fresh and finding their best form three months into their season. Of course, as has been demonstrated in the Uefa Cup/Europa League by CSKA, Zenit and Shakhtar in the past eight seasons, if Russian sides can make it through the group stage, and can get through the first round of European games after the winter when they're still shifting into gear, they should be far fresher than the western sides come April.</p> <p>The sides from Russia and Ukraine need results early, hoping to get enough points on the board to be able to battle through November. That's a concern for Zenit as they stutter and also for Spartak, who started the season with three straight wins, lost 5-0 at Zenit, and are without a victory in their last four as they adjust to life under Unai Emery. The Swedish midfielder Kim Kallstrom and the Argentinian centre-back Juan Insaurralde were their most eye-catching summer signings, but with Emery likely to opt for a defensive 4-2-3-1, his big decision is whether to start with Artem Dzyuba as his lone forward or the Nigerian Emmanuel Emenike.</p> <p>The form of the Ukrainian contenders has been rather more convincing. Shakhtar have been awesome, scoring fewer than three goals only once as they've won their first nine games of the season. They have an abundance of creators, all pulled together by the intelligent, creative play of the 23-year-old Armenian Henrik Mkhitaryan. Mircea Lucescu's side has been dominant for some time in Ukraine; where he has always fallen short in Europe, but a home start against the Danish champions Nordsjaelland, who have won just four of their first nine league games of the season, shouldn't present too much of a problem.</p> <p>Dynamo, meanwhile, having won seven and lost two domestically (one of the defeats to Shakhtar) warmed up for the trip to PSG with a 3-1 win at home to Karpaty, Niko Kranjcar scoring twice. Yuri Semin has been under pressure for months, but he endures, as does his 4-1-4-1/4-2-3-1 hybrid, with Denys Harmash flitting between the back of midfield and supporting Kranjcar, who is used centrally behind Ideye Brown. If Semin is to retain his job, Dynamo, you feel, have to get off to a good start.</p> <p>Shakhtar may be in the best form of the four Russian and Ukrainian sides in action this week but, purely because of the money they've spent, it's Zenit who seem at the forefront of the ongoing eastern development.</p>",
  "<p>My journey to headship so far has been long, both in distance and time. It seems ages ago that I submitted an internal application to become a senior teacher to cover a colleague who had been granted early retirement. My leadership journey has seen me teaching tamariki (Maori children) in New Zealand and being questioned in a wharenui (meeting house) on why a white man is talking about their children's education to overcoming the challenge of gaining my NPQH (<a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/nationalcollege/index/professional-development/npqh.htm\">National Professional Qualification for Headship</a>). I finally found the support from the Future Leaders charity four years ago. The charity, like myself, believes that leadership it not solely born out of the length of service, but must have clarity of purpose; in this case, that all young people have the right and ability to succeed in education, whatever their background.</p> <p>As I write this blog, I'm reminded of the post-Olympics comments on the number of our medal winners being from an independent school background. What is it that has enabled them to succeed? Is it purely a privileged background? The latest statistics say one in four UK children grow up in poverty; the UK has a greater variation in reading standards than almost every other developed country in the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\">OECD</a> and the attainment gap between children from rich and poor backgrounds is detectable at an early age (22 months) which widens throughout the education system. There are however many stories of this not always being the case. My deputy principal recently shared a story of an urban primary where staff built strong relationships with the students; created an environment where students believed in their success and set the expectations high, because of their belief that people always rise to expectations, students achieved their dreams. So is it our leadership of learning that acts as the catalyst which eventually results in bucking the trend? Do we provide that self-belief that my parents instilled in me that put me in the position to be to be writing this? My mother left school at 14 with a certificate in home economics and my father had to leave school after his O-levels because his school didn't offer A-levels, but still they raised my aspiration in education and the opportunities that it can open in life.</p> <p>This begins at primary schools, where the need for quality leadership is evident in the statistics: in 2010/2011, 58% of primary pupils eligible for free school meals (a key deprivation indicator) achieved the expected level in both English and maths compared with 78% of all other pupils, and 100,000 pupils did not achieve the expected literacy levels at all. We need to engage with children as early as possible - that means placing inspirational leaders in challenging primary schools to really have an impact on closing the achievement gap, which will impact on the student's ability to access education much later on in secondary school. Recently I had to challenge an adult who said that unless we taught the parents how to bring up their children then our results would never improve. I am an educationalist, my area of influence is the school that I lead and if our parents don't read with their children at night, then I am not going to comment on their parenting ability. I will however, identify gaps in our students' learning and make sure that these areas are taught during their school day; after all it is my responsibility to educate them for more than 20 hours a week, 38 weeks of the year.</p> <p>Leading a primary academy has provided a level of freedom that I have not had before; the freedom to lead strategies that will have an impact on aspirations. Success is celebrated at the end of the week with scholars in each year wearing a mortar board and robe, and having afternoon tea with the principal. Our academy mantra is recited during assembly and every lesson and teachers have signs on their doors which show what university or college they attended. All very small things on their own, but together they convey our focus on learning.</p> <p>So if you ask me about how school leadership can benefit children from disadvantaged backgrounds, my answer is clear: it must allow students to dream, be strong enough to make everyone believe in those dreams and focus them to achieve. I hope to lead a school where all our students leave with at least the minimum requirements in literacy and numeracy, as well as the learning skills to allow them to choose their next stage of education. A school where we as adults lead the learning using every second of the school day to teach and where you will never hear anyone use the excuse of a learners background for why they can't achieve their lifelong dream.</p> <p>Future Leaders is now offering its first primary leadership programme for 20 aspiring primary heads starting in November.

  "<p><em>Today's extract from the updated edition of <strong>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial*</strong> is by a media academic, <strong>Tim Crook</strong>, who argues that British journalism is now under unprecedented attack.</em></p> <p><em>He argues that the Leveson inquiry, police investigation and overall criticism means that the well-worn phrase, \"the chilling effect\", is proving inadequate to describe the current situation in which laws are already being interpreted by judges to the detriment of press freedom...</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396260137\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347886636337/HackBookFront.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There is a civil war going on in journalism. It is right against left, broadsheet against tabloid, middle class against working class, broadcast/multi-media against newspaper/online. </p> <p>Journalists and lawyers are accusing each other of committing criminal offences, civil wrongs and professional misconduct. There is no evidence of any consensus or unanimity on what should be done.</p> <p>Academics, including the rather crudely named \"hackademics\", media pressure groups, and the journalists' trade union, NUJ, actually advocate statutory involvement in print/online journalism regulation and a statutorily enforceable \"right to reply\".</p> <p>These measures are to be found in former Warsaw Pact countries struggling to re-arrange fig-leaves over their totalitarian past, failed post-colonial dictatorships and countries with post-second world war civil law jurisdictions culturally arranged to cover-up collaboration with the holocaust and Nazi occupation.</p> <p>The Leveson inquiry is costing more than the Chilcot inquiry, dealing perhaps with a higher scale of human violation and harm, and investigating a decision by this country's government to go to war with deaths and grief far beyond anything caused by a journalist's mobile phone snooping or private investigator's computer hack.</p> <p>Chilcot never dispatched section 21 orders with interrogative questionnaires demanding answers on pain of contempt prosecution.</p> <p>The counsel for \"media victims\", David Sherborne, made it very clear: 'The press is on trial here, and not simply in this room but also out there in the court of public opinion\". </p> <h2>The need to reform inquiry rules</h2> <p>In his closing address, Jonathan Caplan QC for the Daily Mail group, raised the issue of there being \"no right for core participants to cross-examine witnesses who make serious allegations against them\" \u2013 a matter for reform of the statute and rules. </p> <p>He also highlighted the fact that one of Leveson's six assessors was \"a founder, director and trustee of the Media Standards Trust, a core participant... and also a member of the Hacked Off campaign, which are both critics of popular journalism, but you were not given any assessor from the popular press.\"</p> <p><em>[Crook goes on to consider in some detail the various laws that affect journalism, such as libel, and the relatively recent outlawing of other news-gathering methods, such as phone-hacking, blagging, doorstepping and paying public officials. Then he moves on to discuss privacy actions]</em><br> Privacy in the UK is a new restriction on media conduct and content. The English judiciary decided to take control of the definition of public interest in terms of a hierarchy where priority and discretion would be exercised for broadsheet and public service media running serious and somewhat boring stories at the top, and tabloid media gossiping and exposing the tawdry though entertaining private lives of celebrity at the bottom. </p> <p>The judiciary also imported European civil law concepts of private zone of interaction, personal autonomy, equating honour, identity, dignity and respect with reputation through the power line of the 1998 human rights act and European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) case law. </p> <p>It is the English judiciary that is deciding that the betrayal of human relationships through infidelity and consumption of the sex industries \u2013 middle and upper-class exploitation of working class personal dignity \u2013 is not in \"the public interest.\" It is the judges who are deciding what is \"a reasonable expectation of privacy.\"</p> <p>The power and control is now determined by a privatised legal profession chasing the profits of privacy litigation with charges 140 times greater than the European average and judges who conceive of privacy as a cube of ice that has to be kept in the freezer of prior restraint. </p> <p>In the USA, not only is there a public interest threshold to be met on an entitlement to claim for breach of privacy, it is also a tort that is only available post-publication. </p> <p>Countries with a process of secret prior restraint to publication are, and can never be, true democracies. The existence of such legal facility is the mark of an authoritarian state infrastructure of information control and censorship.</p> <p>The ethical and legal wrongs of Hackgate happened with a backdrop of the English judiciary turning a developing media respect to the right for privacy into a notorious censorship law prohibiting the publication of truth through secret injunction, with injunctions imposed on the very existence of an injunction (the super-injunction). </p> <p>The tide is inundating the popular newspaper market competing to serve its consumers, otherwise known as \"the common people\", with stories that were water-tight and proofed in the winning of a defendant's burden of truth by securing the evidence to justify libel; only to discover that the law of privacy has holed them below the water line.</p> <h2>The new chilling effect</h2> <p>This is the new chilling effect \u2013 the prohibition on the publication of truth through secret court order on moral issues and matters that public opinion survey might well regard as matters of public debate and interest. </p> <p>And, very slowly, a minority of concerned voices in the superior broadsheet media, who always considered themselves culturally and morally superior to their scallywag brothers and sisters in the tabloids, are becoming aware of the boomerang.</p> <p>Injunctions favouring the multi-national Trafigura, notorious former Bank of Scotland Chief Executive Fred Goodwin, controversial footballer Ryan Giggs and self-confessed sex addicted American golfer Tiger Woods hardly engender much public confidence in the ability of her majesty's courts to make rulings \"in the public interest.\"</p> <p>The public debate about statutorily establishing and defining a public interest may be missing the point about comparative media jurisprudence. The closer the power and determination of public interest is in the control of state officials and legislative, executive or judicial bodies, the closer we are to jurisdictions in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>Far too many potential news-gathering criminal offences have no \"public interest\" defences; thus leaving decisions on whether to prosecute or not with a state- appointed government prosecuting official (the director of public prosecutions).</p> <p>It may well be a sociological paradox that is difficult for the bourgeois broadsheet-hugging intelligentsia to accept, but the News of the World, over 168 years, fought for and spoke for the battered and proud working class who washed the doorsteps of their \"slums\" clean every morning, loyally paid their pounds, shillings and pence to the man from the PRU, migrated from servile back-breaking service in the rich peoples' town and country houses to the new jobs as clerks, telephone girls, shop assistants and managers, ribbon road factory workers in heavy and light industries and sought social mobility in wider education and the promise of lower and middle class home ownership.</p> <p>The equalising 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s of the 20th century have been replaced by inequality, narrowing opportunity, decline of meritocracy and rise of the super and ugly rich celebrocracy, avoiding taxes and concentrating their wealth in off-shore havens. </p> <p>The real cesspit of nihilist ethicism is the City world of casino banking and finance where people work the least for the most and destroy and corrupt the wider economy. </p> <p>Perhaps the NoW helped engender a little fear in the world of over-indulgent and undeserving rich and emotionally cut them down to size as well as exposing sexual corruption, exploitation and social hypocrisy. </p> <p>What was published was notoriously pompous, tawdry, salacious and wretched. Perhaps it poached more than its fair share of other people's dignity. But in \"draining the swamp\" of those who insult with intrusive truth to power, we may well have lost more than a few nasty alligators, snakes and piranhas in the journalistic Street of Shame.</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> Media academic <strong>Barry Turner</strong> examines the way in which a selection of the main questions set by the Leveson inquiry have been answered</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, will be published by Abramis on 17 September.

  "<p>The police officer acquitted of killing Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests in London faces certain dismissal after a disciplinary panel found he had committed gross misconduct.</p> <p>PC Simon Harwood <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/17/pc-simon-harwood-met-police\" title=\"\">accepted that he had made a \"bad decision\" in striking and pushing Tomlinson</a> as the bystander walked away from police lines, and that he would never work as a police officer again, his lawyer told the hearing.</p> <p>But Tomlinson's family dismissed the proceedings as a \"whitewash\". Tomlinson's stepson Paul King said: \"I think it's pointless, it hasn't proved anything to us. We still haven't got any answer from this. After three-and-a-half years, I think it's diabolical. It's like we're back at day one. We will carry on, it isn't going to be the last of it.\" He said there was \"no justice\" in the fact that Harwood faces the sack.</p> <p>Commander Julian Bennett, chairing the three-strong disciplinary panel, the first from the Metropolitan police to sit in public, ruled that Harwood's actions on 1 April 2009 amounted to gross misconduct.</p> <p>However, to the dismay of the Tomlinson family, the panel agreed with representations from Harwood's lawyers that the hearing did not need to investigate the issue of whether the policeman's actions led to Tomlinson's death. Tomlinson's widow, Julia, and some of the couple's children walked out of the hearing soon after this.</p> <p>Harwood, a riot officer with the Met's elite Territorial Support Group unit, had admitted baton-striking and pushing Tomlinson, 47, and gross misconduct, Bennett told the hearing.</p> <p>He said: \"We find that both the baton strike and the push were unnecessary, we find both were disproportionate and unreasonable.\" Harwood, he added, had breached three of the four standards of professional behaviour listed on the charge: use of force, authority, respect and courtesy, and discreditable conduct. This \"does amount to gross misconduct\", Bennett said.</p> <p>The panel, also comprising another senior Met officer, Chief Superintendent Wayne Chance, and a lay member, Andrew Lowe, retired to consider their actions. This will certainly include sacking Harwood from the force. He will not, however, lose his police pension as he has not been convicted of a criminal offence.</p> <p>Patrick Gibbs QC, representing Harwood, 45, said the officer had twice offered to resign from the force, firstly after an inquest into Tomlinson's death recorded a verdict of unlawful killing and then, in July, when a criminal trial found Harwood not guilty of his manslaughter.</p> <p>\"He thought that that was the right thing to do,\" Gibbs said. \"He wanted to minimise further embarrassment to the Metropolitan police service.\" Both offers were refused, the lawyer added.</p> <p>Tomlinson died shortly after Harwood struck him on the leg with a baton and pushed him to the ground as he tried to make his way home past police lines following a day of protests connected to the G20 meetings. An initial postmortem examination said Tomlinson, who was a long-term alcoholic, died of natural causes.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2012/jul/19/simon-harwood-ian-tomlinson-video\" title=\"\">video footage, handed to the Guardian</a> by someone observing the incident, showed Harwood's actions, and two further postmortem examinations said the cause of death was internal bleeding caused by his falling to the pavement after the push.</p> <p>The contradictory verdicts of the inquest and trial dismayed the Tomlinson family, who hoped the disciplinary hearing might give its own decision on whether Harwood was responsible for the death.</p> <p>But at the start of proceedings Gibbs made it clear Harwood would only admit the gross misconduct charge if a reference to his actions \"inadvertently causing or contributing to the death of Mr Tomlinson\" was removed.</p> <p>\"PC Harwood does accept the discredit his actions have brought on the Metropolitan police does amount to gross misconduct and he has twice offered his resignation,\" said Gibbs, who also represented Harwood at his manslaughter trial.</p> <p>\"As far as the use of force, he completely accepts that the force he used was completely unnecessary.\"</p> <p>However, Gibbs said, the reference to causing Tomlinson's death was \"gratuitous and provocative, designed to provoke a retrial of Mr Harwood on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/19/simon-harwood-not-guilty-ian-tomlinson\" title=\"\">charges on which he has already been acquitted</a>\".</p> <p>The manslaughter trial jury was not told details of Harwood's past record, notably that he quit the Met on health grounds in 2001 shortly before an earlier planned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/20/police-simon-harwood-disciplinary-records?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">disciplinary hearing</a> into claims he illegally tried to arrest a driver after a road rage incident while off duty, altering his notes to retrospectively justify the actions.</p> <p>Harwood was nonetheless able to join another force, Surrey, before returning to serve with the Met in 2005. He also allegedly punched, throttled, kneed or threatened other suspects while in uniform in other incidents. Most of the complaints were unproven.</p> <p>Reacting to the judgement, King said: \"It's a whitewash. It's like they've let him resign already.\"</p> <p>Flanked by his brother and Julia, King said it was as if the force had answered \"no comment\" to the question over whether Harwood's actions led to Tomlinson's death from internal injuries.</p> <p>An inquest found the father-of-nine was unlawfully killed, but Harwood was acquitted of his manslaughter.</p> <p>The family's solicitor, Jules Carey, said the family had been \"cheated of an opportunity\" to address the difference between the inquest verdict of unlawful killing and Harwood's acquittal for manslaughter.</p> <p>Carey added: \"The family want a judgment in the civil court. They want it to be determined finally whether or not PC Harwood is guilty as an employee of the police of killing Ian Tomlinson.\"</p> <p>It is only the second time the Independent Police Complaints Commission has instructed police to hold a disciplinary hearing in public following a law passed in 2008.</p> <p>The only other public hearing concerning officers accused of failing in their duty when they did not respond to repeated calls from Colette Lynch, a young woman in Rugby, Warwickshire, about threats from her ex-partner. He stabbed her to death days later.</p>",
  "<p>Opposition groups in Syria have been accused of committing war crimes including torture and the summary execution of prisoners, and the UN has been warned of a growing number of human rights violations and the presence of foreign Islamist fighters ranged against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said it had documented more than a dozen executions by rebels in the northern provinces of Idlib and Aleppo and the coastal region of Latakia. Three opposition leaders who were confronted with evidence of extrajudicial killings said the victims had deserved to die, HRW reported.</p> <p>The Free Syrian Army, the main armed opposition group, came under pressure from foreign supporters to end abuses after the public execution of 14 members of a clan of pro-regime militiamen in Aleppo in August. It then issued a code of conduct and pledged to respect human rights and humanitarian law.</p> <p>\"Declarations by opposition groups that they want to respect human rights are important, but the real test is how opposition forces behave,\" said Nadim Houry, deputy Middle East director at HRW. \"Time and again Syria's opposition has told us it is fighting against the government because of its abhorrent human rights violations. Now is the time for the opposition to show that they really mean what they say.\"</p> <p>Assad's government has been repeatedly condemned by human rights organisations and foreign governments for systematic abuses that are said to amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p> <p>In Geneva, meanwhile, the UN human rights council heard a report describing the \"increasing and alarming presence\" of \"foreign Islamist elements\" in Syria. That presence tended to radicalise homegrown rebels who had also committed crimes, said the investigator Paulo Pinheiro. \"Gross violations of human rights have grown in number, in pace and in scale,\" Pinheiro told diplomats.</p> <p>Pinheiro revealed a new secret list of Syrian individuals and units suspected of committing war crimes who should face criminal prosecution. It was based on \"a formidable and extraordinary body of evidence\", he said. He urged the UN security council to refer the situation in Syria to the international criminal court (ICC).</p> <p>Against a background of bitter disagreements and effective paralysis at the UN, western countries are seeking further condemnation of Assad's government. Russia and China, which have used their security council vetoes to block any punitive action against Syria, seem certain to oppose any ICC referral.</p> <p>The UN says 20,000 people have been killed in Syria in the past 18 months. Activists say the true figure is now closer to 30,000.</p> <p>In Cairo, the foreign ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey were meeting in the framework of a new diplomatic \"contact group\" proposed by Egypt to try to produce a regional solution to the Syrian crisis. Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN envoy who replaced Kofi Annan this month, was due to meet them to report on his meeting with Assad in Damascus on Saturday. Brahimi has described his mission as \"nearly impossible\".</p> <p>Iran, Syria's closest regional ally, is said to be seeking to expand the group to include Iraq as well as Venezuela. The US, Britain and other western countries \u2013 and Syria's divided opposition \u2013 say Iran cannot help end the crisis since its support for Assad makes it part of the problem. Another glaring difficulty is that Saudi Arabia is a keen supporter of the anti-Assad opposition.</p>",
  "<p>In a world where job hopping and freelance working are becoming increasingly prevalent, Senapathy Gopalakrishnan is a reminder of the importance of long-term commitment in the building of corporate success.</p> <p>The co-chairman of Infosys, one of the world's fastest growing innovation technology companies, says the root of its success is that the original values still run through the business like a stick of rock.</p> <p>\"I strongly believe that founders who are passionate about what they do and what they believe in have a special feeling and ownership of a business,\" says Gopalakrishnan. \"There is a sense of purpose which creates a different philosophy and culture.\"</p> <p>While the multinational provider of business consulting, technology, engineering and outsourcing, based in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), operates in a complex and rapidly changing climate, the company's foundation is still built on a single word: respect.</p> <p>\"When we started in 1971, we were all first generation entrepreneurs,\" he says. \"We did not have a lot of money to back us and started in a third world country.</p> <p>\"When we discussed what should be our vision, we came to the word respect. We felt it is the most enduring thing because whether small or large, the aspiration to be respected will make us do the right thing and drive every decision we make.</p> <p>\"If you strive for respect from customers and employees, you will treat them fairly. With investors you have to give decent returns and make sure you are profitable and respect from society, means they see a benefit from Infosys existing.\"</p> <p>A year ago the company revisited the vision and shortened it to simply wanting to be a 'globally respected corporation.'</p> <h2>Longterm thinking</h2> <p>Gopalakrishnan recognises that the idea that a company has a duty to produce products and services that can improve the lives of ordinary people may seem old fashioned in an era of profit maximisation and short-termism, but hopes it is now starting to gain traction again.</p> <p>He says companies in general need to recognise that the long term success of any organisation depends on investing time and effort in research and development, pointing as an example to the time and energy in creating Nasa's Mars Curiosity rover.</p> <p>\"I strongly believe that all of us need to think medium to long term,\" says Gopalakrishnan \"We need to understand that the true value of a business to society is not about making profits but creating products and services that create advances in society. As a result of that, you derive profit; it is an outcome of what you do.</p> <p>\"If you take a short term view, you will create products and services that will give you profits but may be harmful to society.\"</p> <h2>Reinventing business</h2> <p>Gopalakrishnan acknowledges that Infosys, like other companies, is under pressure to perform from shareholders, who often hold stock for only a short time and have little loyalty to the business.</p> <p>This is particularly true at the moment as the company goes through a difficult transition from a focus on selling products to offering cloud computer services.</p> <p>But he believes the pendulum is swinging back, with a growing recognition that short-termism has done more harm than good and that companies need to balance the needs of shareholders with other stakeholder needs, such as providing opportunities for employees to have long-term security whenever possible.</p> <p>\"More and more these discussions are happening in economic institutions and on public forums and at some point will reach a critical mass,\" he says. \"All these things are cyclical. Business probably went to one extreme in terms of focus on short-termism and we need to move back into balance as even investors will get hurt because of this. If that doesn't happen, you will destroy the confidence in business. The rationale for business needs to be revisited and maybe reinvented.\"</p> <p>In particular, Gopalakrishnan sees the importance of the corporate sector regaining the trust of society and recognising that it needs a licence to operate and this is not automatically guaranteed.</p> <p>\"Society has created the concepts such as the corporation, limited liability,\" he says. \"All these are permissions given by society to exist and society can take these away and regulations will increase because the trust is going away. We have to work very hard to rebuild that trust. It is about shareholders having had an unfair advantage over other stakeholders. This is a painful correction process but it is necessary.\"</p> <h2>Embedding values into the business</h2> <p>As Gopalakrishnan and CEO, SD Shibulal, another original founder, head towards retirement, they recognise that the values they hold dear may be eroded once they leave their positions of power.</p> <p>For that reason, they have been creating a programme to ensure that the values are understood and integrated across the business.</p> <p>\"It is a worry we have for Infosys,\" says Gopalakrishnan. \"We are trying very hard to codify what our values are. They are universal; they are not Asian or Indian. We talk about focussing on providing value to the customer, leadership by example, so there is only one set of rules for everyone in the company including the CEO and chairman, fairness across all stakeholders and excellence in all aspects of business \u2013 same in your accounting, or HR or reporting.\"</p> <p>He says it is not enough to communicate the values on a one-off basis, but staff are regularly reminded of how they should be embedded in decision-making, which is why every member of staff attends workshops every two to three years.</p> <h2>Respecting every employee</h2> <p>Ethics is also at the heart of the company's leadership programme, which involves 600 managers.</p> <p>What Gopalakrishnan thinks makes Infosys stand out from the crowd is its belief in leadership by example and this means that \"even we as founders always behave as an employee. What that means in practice, for example, is that we don't have private planes, travel economy if less then four hours and there is no first class. I have to submit attendance, leave. If I don't do that, I get an alert.</p> <p>\"This is not humility but about respecting every employee within the company and the same rules must apply to everyone. It creates a culture which is very different, which says the work every employee does is important.</p> <p>\"An example is the employee who sets up the conference rooms, making sure they are clean, that the glasses are without blemishes. We appreciate that because he or she is trying to be the best in the role they are playing. We need to recognise that.\"</p> <h2>Harnessing the power of technology</h2> <p>Gopalakrishnan is convinced that sustainability can be to the 21st century what the Internet was to the second half of the 20th century. While digital computing revolutionised many aspect of our lives and destroyed some industries and created others, he says that sustainability will have an even broader impact in areas ranging from alternative energy and new forms of transportation to the resources we use and how we produce food.</p> <p>\"It requires a tremendous amount of innovation and it is good for society and the world,\" he says.</p> <p>\"The sooner we embrace this and invest in innovation, the better off we will be. I see countries and businesses needing to take leadership.\"</p> <p>Gopalakrishnan says that while technology can benefit all, it also has the capacity to create harm. He gives the crude example that electricity can light up our lives and also kill us.</p> <p>\"It is human beings who decide how to leverage technology and where to put limits,\" he says. \"So it is important we understand the power and benefits as well as the problems technology can create.</p> <p>\"If you look at the challenges facing humanity today such as climate change and poverty and water scarcity, they all need answers from using technology, but we have to be very careful we look at any unintended consequences.</p> <p>\"We have to control technology rather than letting technology control us. We are changing as human beings with advances in technology and we will probably lose the ability to do certain things, because technology eliminates the need to do them, and get replaced by new capabilities.</p> <p>\"It's very difficult to know what is the right thing. It is probably in some sense bordering on philosophy and spirituality.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

She's also more Bj\u00f6rk than Beyonc\u00e9, a kookstress with a high chirrup of a voice and a backstory involving a bird obsession and a bee fetish. Don't expect wall-to-wall cute, though. On Crow, one of several avian-related titles on her The Bird School of Being Human album, she sings about building \"a great funeral pyre\" as the music becomes increasingly clanging and industrial.

Without remotely trying to tick boxes or appease diametrically opposed demographics, this Floridian five-piece have made a record that could appeal to fans of both Four Tet and Fairport Convention, Espers and Grimes. They are fronted by Nicole Miglis, who calls herself a \"melody maker [and] word weaver\" and has something about her of the mystical British folk-girl, as well as, in her voice, some of the hiccupy kookiness of a Bj\u00f6rk. Miglis is a classically trained pianist and vocalist, but the other players are no slouches, either in the performing or the programming departments \u2013 they switch between instruments and gadgets with aplomb and are clearly as adept at handling things with strings as they are things with cables and wires. There is an intricacy to the musicianship, of whatever form, that could tantalise prog-rock lifers, and the production has a pristine precision that will make sense through the inventions of Messrs Sennheiser and Bose.</p> <p>No wonder early reviews of this thoroughly modern but heritage-steeped folk album have included talk of \"the simply staggering sophistication of [the] arrangements\" while the group's \"tendency to explore phrases and shapes before locking into a groove\" suggests a familiarity with the instrumental extrapolations of jazz. We would struggle with where to position it in a record store, and we imagine you might too. Opening track Sonnet is in a similar realm of indie-tronic itchiness as a Django Django or Alt-J. Visitor starts with breathy vocals and twinkling synths, before building and developing into something sufficiently rhythmic for dancing, and we don't mean round a maypole. Me and Anodyne is a headphonicists delight, with that breezy lightness peculiar to post-Animal Collective alt-pop and a clipped percussiveness redolent of Dirty Projectors at their most sinistral (not sinister) and sweet. Thistle is the sound of faeries and fair maidens getting funky in the forest. Caverns takes the conventional song form, then stretches it out. On ..._ _ _ ... Hundred Waters really have fun with the bleepy sonics while still keeping one foot in the past \u2013 this is where the middle ages meet the space age. Throughout, there is a quirky, darting playfulness to the melodies, and a sort of clinical warmth to the sound, if that isn't a contradiction in terms.

Indeed, there is a growing recognition within our sector that in the golden years of arts funding we perhaps overlooked the significant income generating potential of our work, beyond selling tickets and hiring out spaces.</p> <p>Funding agencies too are beginning to favour one-off investments that will make arts organisations self-sustaining in the future; supporting initiatives that look to earn income through intellectual property and cultural assets. Gradually the question is being asked: rather than asking money for what we do, is it not better to earn money from what we know?</p> <p>The process of thinking more commercially can throw up all sorts of questions around how you position your organisation and products. For example, it would be natural to assume that you should focus on your audience as your biggest customer and your brand as your biggest selling point. How better to promote your new enterprise than to draw on the solid artistic reputation and following you have painstakingly developed over the years?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iniva.org/\" title=\"\">At Iniva</a> (Institute of International Visual Arts) we're experiencing something interesting that challenges this assumption. For over 20 years, we have operated at the cutting edge of global contemporary art \u2013 producing exhibitions, publications and research around international and culturally diverse artists. In doing so we have gained an audience interested in global artistic practice who visit our exhibitions, talks and library.</p> <p>However, in recent years, working in partnership with educational therapy service <a href=\"http://www.aspaceinhackney.org/index.html\" title=\"\">A Space</a>, we have also been producing a series of resources that draw on the imagery of contemporary art to support emotional and creative learning. These emotional learning cards were initially devised as a way for us to promote the work of artists from diverse backgrounds and we sold them as we would any publication \u2013 through our website, venue and distributors.</p> <p>A year ago we started to look at releasing a new set of cards but were concerned that sales of the existing sets were not fulfilling their potential. We decided to do some investigative work into who was buying them.</p> <p>Our findings were intriguing: we realised that those who were coming to our website to buy the cards were not our usual audience. They were teachers, therapists, counsellors and parents who had heard about our resources through word of mouth. We started to wonder whether to use the existing Iniva brand and website was the right approach to selling the cards. Wouldn't it be better to create a new website that targeted more directly our newly discovered market?</p> <p>We decided to test this idea and developed a new brand and website: Iniva Creative Learning.</p> <p>If you compare our <a href=\"http://inivacreativelearning.org/\" title=\"\">Creative Learning website</a> with our <a href=\"http://www.iniva.org/\" title=\"\">main website</a> you can see how the two brands differ in their messages and approach. Creating this difference was quite a challenge. We went through an extensive process of sifting and simplifying our language; challenging ourselves to discover ways of talking about art that would be relevant and appealing to our new customer while also giving them the information they needed.</p> <p>The main Iniva website offers a wealth of information for the visitor to pick and choose from: upcoming events, an image and audio archive of work, and information on our venue and library. In contrast, the new site directs the visitor straight to our products. All the information on the website is purposed to the act of buying our resources. Again, as an organisation more attuned to sharing ideas than selling products, this has at times felt alien.</p> <p>However, since the second site went live in May, the increase in sales has been remarkable. With a little online marketing we immediately went from selling two to three products a week to two to three products a day \u2013 within six weeks sales had increased by 300%. After posting a few blogs on various therapy related sites, we've suddenly found a surge of interest from American therapists and counsellors \u2013 a market that is not insubstantial.</p> <p>Of those who have bought our resources, 50% classify themselves as mental health workers, 35% are teachers and the remaining 15% arts educators, parents and \"others\" \u2013 with only one or two exceptions they are an entirely different set of stakeholders to Iniva's visiting artistic audience.</p> <p>So, is it right to separate commercial from artistic activity in this way? No doubt there are issues about capacity and clarity of focus in facing two different directions at the same time. There is also the potential missed opportunity of converting customer to audience or vice versa. But we found that the act of presenting our artistic and commercial products together under one brand meant that one automatically overshadowed the other. In our case two brands are better than one.</p> <p><em>Paddy Chatterton is head of development at Iniva \u2013 follow the institute on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Iniva_arts\" title=\"\"><em>@Iniva_arts</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>First they gave us a Total Recall remake with Arnie, Mars and all the Paul Verhoeven bombast ruthlessly excised. Now Hollywood is planning a Robocop who looks distinctly unrobotic. <a href=\"http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=94813\" title=\"\">The first pictures of Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy in the upcoming Jos\u00e9 Padilha remake of Verhoeven's 1987 satirical science-fiction romp have hit the web</a>, and already there are howls of furious anguish from fans of the original film everywhere.</p> <p>There had already been rumours that the new Robocop would have a substantially different look to the clunky much-loved Peter Weller iteration, but a set of pap shots published by Comingsoon.net suggest a crime-fighting machine who is not so much cyborg as skinny bloke in matt-black body armour. The new Robosuit has a scaly, insectoid look to it, with a blacked-out visor rather than the original's steel extended helmet. For me, it recalls the futuristic cop body armour worn in Minority Report rather than Weller's shiny, chunky getup. While fears that we would be able to see Kinnaman's full face most of the time appear to have been \u2013 at least partially \u2013 averted, the new outfit doesn't seem to lend its wearer the statuesque solidity of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/mar/29/robocop-total-recall-paul-verhoeven\" title=\"\">the original Robocop</a>, jutting jawline, menacing swivel and all.</p> <p>\"The original Robocop looked like a robot, this one looks like a guy in a suit,\" <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/100awn/my_friend_improved_the_new_robocop_look_a_bit/\" title=\"\">wrote one user on the social news site Reddit.com</a>, while another mused: \"I had no doubt that the original Robocop was just a dude's face and torso stuck inside a machine. This one just looks like he's wearing armour.\"</p> <p>On the other hand, these are not official shots, and it may be that Kinnaman (so excellent in the US version of The Killing) will give better cyborg when the cameras are rolling. Some fans of the original film have even been musing, rather hopefully, that Kinnaman is wearing a CGI bodysuit which will have a more imposing set of armour placed over the top in post-production, or even that the outfit he sports in the pictures might be standard issue for Detroit police in the film. If either of those is true, we can surely expect to see a clarification from Kinnaman or Padilha at some point.</p> <p>In the meantime, some solace: not all sci-fi reinventions are failures. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/sep/03/dredd-judge-alex-garland-pete-travis\" title=\"\">new Judge Dredd film, Dredd</a>, has very little of the satirical over-the-top silliness which made the original 2000AD comic such a joy, but is nevertheless very good indeed. Might Padilha, who has an impressive cast that includes Gary Oldman, Samuel L Jackson, Michael Keaton, Abbie Cornish and Jackie Earle Haley to work with, yet pull off what at first sight seems to be a very different kind of Robocop? The film is currently shooting in Toronto for a 9 August release in the US and UK.</p>",
  "<p>In the sleepy, picturesque towns and villages of south-west Germany, the paragons of thrift are doing what they do best. They shop frugally, use credit cards rarely and save up to a third of a property's value before applying for a mortgage.</p> <p>The <em>schw\u00e4bische Hausfrau</em> \u2013 southern Germany's thrifty Swabian housewife \u2013 is frequently invoked by Angela Merkel. The German chancellor argues that Europe has been living beyond its means and can learn from these women's frugal housekeeping and balanced budgeting.</p> <p>Heide Sickinger and Waltraud Maier, two housewives from Gerlingen, near Stuttgart, agree. \"A housewife keeps the family together and the money,\" says Maier. \"I don't buy on credit. People never used to live beyond their means here,\" she adds, before noting that the younger generation are more cavalier. She and her friend only use credit cards when they go on holiday, and make sure they have enough money in their accounts to pay off the debt immediately. Both believe that \"southern Europeans are a different breed. They are more easy-going\".</p> <p>The two women say that they only tend to buy what they really need (with the exception of a flatscreen TV). Even a wardrobe counts as a luxury purchase \u2013 because Swabians don't buy cheap. They value quality, which means a wardrobe has to be solid wood, so it lasts a lifetime.</p> <p>Similarly, the two women buy their food at the butcher's, local farms and markets, rather than at discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl. \"The quality is better,\" says Maier, \"and you can buy two carrots rather than a whole kilogramme.\" She never throws anything away \u2013 old bread is made into bread dumplings, for example. Many people in this rural area grow their own fruit and vegetables, and bottle or pickle them.</p> <p>This outlook is informed by a national psyche profoundly shaped by the experience of the Weimar republic's debt mountain and hyperinflation in the 1920s, when people pushed carts overflowing with banknotes through the streets.</p> <p>You won't find any luxury boutiques in Gerlingen. Nonetheless, its 20,000 inhabitants have more purchasing power \u2013 an estimated \u20ac500m (\u00a3400m) a year \u2013 than any other town in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Even the nearby state capital, Stuttgart, doesn't have many luxury shops. Compare that with Munich's Theatinerstrasse, which is lined with international brands such as Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Armani and Swarovski.</p> <p>\"Bavarians live the baroque life,\" says Angela Schmid, head of the German housewife association's W\u00fcrttemberg branch. \"Swabians do buy luxury clothes and other goods, but they don't like to show off. You might see a Swabian housewife enter a luxury boutique who is dressed like her cleaner. You won't see amazing hats in the street either or jewellery \u2013 people only show them to each other in private.\"</p> <p>Swabians even have an expression for this \u2013 <em>h\u00e4linge reich</em>, which means \"secretly rich\".</p> <p>Catharina Raible, director of the Gerlingen town museum, says that when Swabians do splash out on something like a fur coat, they wear the fur on the inside. \"Not outside \u2013 so you don't see it.\"</p> <p>She recounts that Robert Bosch, the founder of the electronics company, whose family still lives in Gerlingen, used to wear a thick loden coat with an inside fur lining: \"a typical Swabian\". Despite the family's wealth, the children wore clothes that had been mended. Sickinger says: \"You learn how to save from the rich.\"</p> <p>Gerlingen is wealthy because many Bosch managers live there \u2013 the company has its headquarters in the town \u2013 and its hillside homes are popular with those working in Stuttgart, which is a 25-minute commuter train ride away. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's former prime minister, Lothar Sp\u00e4th, also lives in Gerlingen.</p> <p>Both Sickinger and Maier drive Mercedes cars, but Sickinger recalls that she and her husband drove battered old cars until her father-in-law died. That's when they bought a one-year-old Mercedes. Her mother-in-law said at the time: \"Grandpa would never have bought a car, but a field.\" Maier chips in: \"People never sold any land. The older generation were far more thrifty than us.\"</p> <p>Southern Germany's frugality has its roots in the 19th century, when the area was very poor. Another influence was Pietism, a movement within Lutheranism that emphasised hard work and shunned worldly amusements.</p> <p>The Swabian saying <em>Schaffe, schaffe, H\u00e4usle baue</em> \u2013 which translates as \"work and work to build a house\" \u2013 also dates back to that time. \"You feel guilty when you're not working,\" says Sickinger. Swabians typically buy or build their own homes in their late 20s to early 30s, and they also start saving for retirement from a young age.</p> <p>Mortgages are traditionally provided by building societies in Germany and the rule of thumb has been for people to save a third of the purchase price and to borrow at fixed mortgages for up to 25 years. Unlike in the UK, where people usually upgrade to bigger homes as soon as they can afford to, a house is bought or built for life.</p> <p>German families are squirrelling away almost twice as much as UK households, according to a Lloyds TSB report this year. The typical German household has \u00a38,609 in savings and investments, against \u00a35,009 in the UK.</p> <p>The chunk of their incomes that Germans put into savings, investments and pensions has been stable at 10% in recent years, while Britain's savings ratio was on a downward trend until the recession and has since risen to around 7%.</p> <p>Swabians lead the way when it comes to saving in Germany. \"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg has a lot of industry, so people are budgeting on a secure basis \u2013 it's not pure misery,\" says Schmid. Today the south is Germany's wealthiest region.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dhb-netzwerk-haushalt.de/\" title=\"\">Deutscher Hausfrauenbund</a>, the German housewife association that she works for, offers courses in how to run a household, from practical skills to teaching young people how to budget. It also offers a \"master housewife\" qualification for the more ambitious. This used to be a badly paid job but that is changing now. Hospitals, old people's homes and rehabilitation centres increasingly need people with those qualifications, under a federal German law that was passed five years ago. Other master housewives run organic food shops.</p> <p>Gerlingen, for its part, offers housewife tours of the town, which are very popular \u2013 the guide Diana Schneider dresses up as a <em>schw\u00e4bische Hausfrau,</em> complete with overall, apron and broom.</p> <p>\"I'm Erna Schw\u00e4tzele \u2013 she knows how to clean and work and keep the money together. Nothing comes from nothing.\"</p>",
  "<p>The weekend was all about Nipplegate at the House of Hanover, Part II. If the storyline seems familiar, there were just enough twists and changes to keep the insalubrious masses interested. Unlike the earlier instalment, the sequel was not set in the lush surroundings of a Provence villa but at the slightly draftier AWD Arena. And major offence was taken at the topless frolicking itself, not its subsequent depiction in the media.</p> <p>But let's start from the top. The derby between Hannover 96 and Werder Bremen on Saturday had not only promised goals but also an answer to the question of who's number one in the north \u2013 Hamburger SV, who could rightfully claim this unofficial title a while a go, are sadly no longer in the running after they lost 3-2 to Frankfurt on Sunday night, a defeat that sucked Mary Arnesen's Frank-enstein of a team further into the relegation struggle.</p> <p>Hannover were determined to settle this matter quickly. Inside 11 minutes, Mirko Slomka's men were 2-0 up thanks to goals from Szabolcs Huszti and Leon Andreasen. But Werder's formidable front-line kept probing away until Aaron Hunt (penalty) and the Chelsea loanee Kevin de Bruyne had equalised 15 minutes from the end. A thoroughly spectacular game then took a turn for the controversial.</p> <p>Twice Werder thought they had scored a winner, twice the referee Deniz Ayetkin thought otherwise. Thomas Schaaf accepted that Sokratis had strayed offside in the first incident but angrily \"shuddered\" when he saw a repeat of the second situation: Sokratis was adjudged to have impeded Karim Haggui before Assani Lukimya's header. \"We are still looking for the mistake,\" Schaaf commented acidly.</p> <p>The moustachioed manager's afternoon was ruined altogether when the irrepressible Huszti saw that a last-minute cross was coming down behind him. The Hungarian playmaker adjusted himself, took to the air and smashed an overhead kick via Clemens Fritz's back into the Werder goal to win the derby in the most thrilling fashion. And then IT happened.</p> <p>The 29-year-old Hungarian jumped over the advertising hoarding, mounted a fence and took of his shirt in jubilation and the crowd went mad. His team-mate Jan Schlaudraff had tried to stop him but was too late. When Huszti got back on to the pitch, Ayetkin showed him a yellow card for the fence-climbing and another for exposing his breasts. Huszti was sent-packing, then Ayetkin blew the final whistle.</p> <p>The referee admitted that the decision had troubled him \u2013 \"It hurt me\" \u2013 but added that he rulebook left him little choice: \"As the executive, I need to do this. I don't have any other option\".</p> <p>\"It was a little stupid on my behalf,\" admitted Huszti. \"I didn't know this rule but now I have learned something new\".</p> <p>Ayetkin and the referees' chief instructor Lutz Wagner were quick to point out that Fifa is to blame for the overkill. But was there perhaps something specifically German in the law's stringent application? After all, the relevant passage explicitly demands the officials to apply \"common sense\" when it comes to punishing over-exuberant jubilations. \"It's the most non-sensical sending-off in the history of the Bundesliga,\" declared Welt.</p> <p>That silly piece of jobsworthiness aside, it felt like a momentous win for Hannover. Their stealthy ascent to the top of the Bundesliga tree in recent years is set to continue; they have quietly established themselves not only as the best side in the north of the country but they have left plenty of more illustrious and/or wealthier names behind to be become the fourth power after Dortmund, Bayern and Schalke.</p> <p>It is a remarkable achievement made all the more remarkable since the smooth Slomka and the gruff sporting director Hans-J\u00f6rg Schmadtke are about as compatible as an iPad and a C64 tape drive \u2013 there's simply no common wavelength. A public dispute between the president Martin Kind and naughty ultras, who had been hoisting up a banner displaying the face of the Hannover-born serial killer Fritz Haarmann (27 murders from 1918-24), wasn't exactly helpful either.</p> <p>Never mind, though \u2013 Slomka's men keep growing collectively and individually where others are faltering. The inspired \u20ac750,000 return of Huszti after his three less-than-successful years at Zenit St Petersburg looks like another masterstroke. He had already provided the assists for all four goals in the 4-0 win at Wolfsburg the week before. \"Szabi is of the best creative players in the league,\" said Slomka.</p> <p>A few hundred Hannover fans camped outside the stadium to buy tickets for the Europa League game at Twente Enschede, such is the euphoria about a side who have developed their slightly dour counter-attacking from a couple of seasons ago into an expansive, entertaining attacking style. No wonder Schmadtke has been \u2013 somewhat reluctantly \u2013 forced into opening new contract talks with Slomka. The 45-year-old's deal expires at the end of the season and there are envious glances from a certain Bavaria-based club who are unhappy that they've been little more than \"number one in the south\" in recent years.</p> <h2>Talking Points</h2> <p>He likes the smell of <em>Wurstsemmel</em> (sausage bun) in the early evening: Henry Kissinger came to see F\u00fcrth's 2-0 home defeat against Schalke at the Trolli Arena. The 89-year-old American had been a fan of his hometown club before his family fled Nazi Germany in 1938 and had long promised to see a game if they were promoted. \"The German government used to send me their results [in the 70s],\" he recalled. \"And when they were unhappy with me, I'd only get the score on a Tuesday.\"</p> <p>The former US secretary of state was introduced to the team by the manager Mike B\u00fcskens and soon spread plenty of optimism. \"I now wish them for championship title,\" he said. An interesting take on Fussball Realpolitik.</p> <p>Talking of dark, conspiratorial forces, there's a delicious \u2013 if slightly implausible \u2013 theory about Hoffenheim's descent to hell doing the rounds. Are the bad results in fact engineered by parties interested in moving Mario Basler into the managerial job? The former Bayern midfielder is the son in law of the agent Roger Wittmann, who has been able to get a fair number of his players signed up at the club. One of them, the goalkeeper Tim Wiese, had a veritable stinker in the 5-3 defeat at SC Freiburg, where the defensive half of the team were constantly undermining useful efforts by the other half.</p> <p>As a consequence, the manager Markus Babbel has told the board he wants to concentrate on coaching and give up his duties as general manager. Kicker magazine has linked the former Schalke supremo Andreas M\u00fcller with the vacant post. He used to get on pretty well with Wittmann, too.</p> <h2>Results<br></h2> <p>Augsburg 0-0 Wolfsburg</p> <p>Bayern Munich 3-1 Mainz 05</p> <p>Greuther F\u00fcrth 0-2 Schalke 04</p> <p>Dortmund 3-0 Leverkusen</p> <p>Hannover 3-2 Werder Bremen</p> <p>VfB Stuttgart 0-0 F D\u00fcsseldorf</p> <p>M\u00f6nchengladbach 2-3 N\u00fcrnberg</p> <p>Feiburg 5-3 Hoffenheim</p> <p>Eintracht Frankfurt 3-2 Hamburger SV</p>",

  "<p>The evolution of TV is stunted. The media report daily on the innovations and achievements of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/connected-tv\" title=\"\">the technology community in television</a>; from time shift TV to touch screen home entertainment. Over the past decade, we have seen smart technology transform the payment, health and enterprise worlds in an age in which we are connected at all times.</p> <p>\"Choice\" and \"interaction\" are the words du jour. Consumers want to be empowered to make better choices about their lives and interact with the world around them in new ways. Innovation is the new currency and in volatile markets, brands who commit are those that come out on top.</p> <p>But what's happened to television? In the so-called year of the Smart TV, we have seen offerings from Samsung, Panasonic, LG and Sony that provide true connectivity and features such as app stores and video link-ups. But where's the buzz and the excitement around this revolution?</p> <p>Consumers have been furnished with one of the biggest developments in technology since the smartphone: an innovation in habit and lifestyle rather than just consumption, and yet the reaction has been lukewarm at best. Tellingly, <a href=\"http://www.kae.com/\" title=\"\">research conducted by KAE</a> revealed that 38% of Sony TV owners and 35% of Samsung TV owners in the UK claimed they found the idea of Apple TV appealing and would buy one. The figures suggest that people are unsatisfied.</p> <p>With rumours of Apple TV in the offing, the question remains whether consumers and the industry can trust them to step up the pace. Many believe that the power of the brand alone will be enough to propel them to the front of the market, but it is through the first priority in development of all Apple products \u2013 user accessibility \u2013 that the brand will ultimately prevail.</p> <p>User experience is a vision so vehemently adhered to in Apple that it was occasionally to the detriment of the company's own marketing strategy. For years, its signature product, the Powerbook, had a seemingly obvious design flaw: its prized Apple appeared upside down to the onlooker when the lid was open. Apple had sacrificed its revered design so that users would know which way to open their laptop.</p> <p>Apple TV or no Apple TV, it is this commitment to the end user which connected TV has thus far been lacking. Currently, only 7% of people who have an internet-ready smart TV use it to connect to the internet, leading to the assumption that consumers simply aren't yet ready for this development within television.</p> <p>The truth is that the companies manufacturing these smart TVs have declined the opportunity to lead the market and change behaviour. The connective technology on these devices is apologetically siloed in a bid to not alienate their loyal base of customers.</p> <p>Current market players have reached a stalemate. Locked into incremental innovation processes, brands \u2013 while purportedly committing to innovation \u2013 are in fact flying in the face of it, competing instead on minor tweaks to their core offerings. With all this connected technology at their disposal \u2013 the opportunity to build an ecosystem across TV, music and social media \u2013 Samsung is still producing a connected TV operated by an eighties-style remote control.</p> <p>It's not new and it's not valuable, but mostly, it's not the behaviour of a market leader. It has become clear that if we are to take advantage of the technology available to us, we are in need of a revolution rather than an evolution, driven by an industry pioneer which excites its customers through a cult of innovation.</p> <p><em>Lee Powney is chief commercial officer at </em><a href=\"http://www.kae.com/\" title=\"\"><em>KAE</em></a><em> \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lpowwow\" title=\"\"><em>@lpowwow</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Japanese companies have temporarily closed factories and offices in China after a weekend of violent protests sparked by the countries' <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/14/china-japan-senkaku-diaoyu-islands\" title=\"\">competing claims </a>to a group of islands in the East China Sea, as the US warned of a danger of armed conflict and urged both sides to exercise restraint.</p> <p>The closures came after people took to the streets in more than 70 Chinese cities to protest the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/11/china-warns-japan-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">Japanese government's purchase</a> last week of the Senkaku islands, known as the Diaoyu in China, from their private Japanese owners.</p> <p>China reacted by sending marine patrol ships to Japanese-claimed waters around the islands. On Monday, the Kyodo news agency, citing the online edition of the Central People's Broadcasting Station in China, said that as many as 1,000 Chinese fishing boats had set sail on Sunday and would arrive in waters off the Senkakus later in the day.</p> <p>The diplomatic row has spilled over into the countries' close economic ties, amid warnings by the US secretary of defence, Leon Panetta, that the spat could deteriorate into armed conflict.</p> <p>\"Obviously we're concerned by the demonstrations and we're concerned by the conflict that is taking place over the Senkaku islands, and the message that I have tried to convey is a message that we have to urge calm and restraint on all sides,\" he told reporters before leaving Tokyo for Beijing earlier on Monday.</p> <p>While it sanctioned the demonstrations, the Chinese government on Monday attempted to dampen anti-Japanese sentiment, removing provocative online comments and photographs of the protests, and threatening to arrest anyone found to have broken the law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396309807\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/16/1347795937866/Senkaku-Diaoyu-Islands-001.png\" alt=\"Senkaku-Diaoyu Islands\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Location of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chinese authorities said 10 people had been arrested for attacking cars or vandalising shops, while arrests were also reported over an arson attack on a Japanese electronics factory and car dealership.</p> <p>In some of the worst of the weekend's protests, demonstrators hurled bottles and other items at the Japanese embassy in Beijing and attacked Japanese restaurants and other businesses in at least five cities.</p> <p>Toyota and Honda said arsonists had badly damaged their dealerships in Qingdao in eastern China, while Panasonic said one of its plants had been set alight. The electronics giant said the factory would remain closed through Tuesday, when China marks the anniversary of the start of Japan's occupation of parts of the country.</p> <p>Canon said it would also close three of its four factories in China for the next two days, while All Nippon Airways reported a spike in cancellations on flights from China to Japan.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Japan's Fast Retailing said would close 19 of its Uniqlo clothing stores in China on Tuesday as it expects the anti-Japan demonstrations to escalate. Asia's largest apparel retailer shut seven stores on Monday.</p> <p>In the southern city of Shenzhen, police fired teargas and turned water cannon and pepper spray on thousands of protesters attempting to occupy a street.</p> <p>On Sunday, Panetta said he was concerned that other countries, including the US, could be dragged into any conflict over the islands.</p> <p>Washington has declined to take sides in the Senkaku row, but acknowledges that under the US-Japan security treaty it is required to come to its ally's aid if it is attacked.</p> <p>Japan's foreign minister, Koichiro Gemba, who met Panetta in Tokyo on Monday, said it was \"mutually understood between Japan and the United States that [the Senkakus] are covered by the treaty\".</p> <p>Panetta said the US did not take a position on the sovereignty claims, but added: \"Having said that, we expect that these issues will be resolved peacefully and although we understand the differences here with regard to jurisdiction, it is extremely important that diplomatic means on both sides be used to try to constructively resolve these issues.</p> <p>\"It is in everybody's interest for Japan and China to maintain good relations and to find a way to avoid further escalation.\"</p> <p>The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, called on the Chinese authorities to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens and businesses. \"Regrettably, this is a problem concerning the safety of Japanese nationals and Japan-affiliated companies,\" he told broadcaster NHK. \"I would like to urge the Chinese government to protect their safety.\"</p> <p>China described Japan's decision to buy three of the uninhabited islets, which are thought to be surrounded by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/19/tokyo-governor-senkaku-islands-china\" title=\"\">huge deposits of natural gas</a>, as a violation of its sovereignty.</p> <p>Japan says the islands have been an integral part of its territory since the late 19th century, claiming that China had only shown an interest in them after studies pointed to the presence of potentially valuable natural resources nearby.</p> <p>Chinese state media and online activists united in calling for a boycott of Japanese goods, while Chinese tourism authorities ordered travel agents to cancel package tours to Japan during a week-long national holiday next month.</p> <p>One newspaper warned Japan that it could face another \"lost decade\" of economic stagnation if trade ties are affected. China replaced Japan as the world's second-biggest economy in 2010, but analysts said that both sides would suffer from a prolonged trade spat.</p> <p>China is Japan's single biggest trading partner and bilateral trade was worth a record $345bn (\u00a3213bn) last year.</p> <p>\"How could it be that Japan wants another lost decade, and could even be prepared to go back by two decades,\" said a front-page editorial in the overseas edition of the People's Daily, a Communist party newspaper.</p> <p>The paper said China had always exercised caution over \"playing the economic card\", adding \"but in struggles concerning territorial sovereignty, if Japan continues its provocations, then China will take up the battle\".</p> <p>Other recent outbreaks of anti-Japanese sentiment, in 2005 and 2010, ended with short-lived protests and minor disruption to trade.</p>",
  "<p>The police officer acquitted of killing Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests in London has accepted that his baton strike and push on Tomlinson as he walked away from police lines amounted to gross misconduct.</p> <p>But speaking at the start of a Metropolitan police disciplinary hearing, PC Simon Harwood's lawyer said he would not accept one particular element of the allegations: that the officer's actions contributed to Tomlinson's death.</p> <p>\"PC Harwood does accept [that] the discredit his actions have brought on the Metropolitan police does amount to gross misconduct and he has twice offered his resignation,\" Patrick Gibbs QC, who also represented Harwood at his trial for manslaughter, told the three-strong panel.</p> <p>\"As far as the use of force, he completely accepts that the force he used was completely unnecessary.\"</p> <p>However, Gibbs said, the addition of the element referring to Harwood's baton strike and push on Tomlinson as \"inadvertently causing or contributing to the death of Mr Tomlinson\" was unnecessary. It was, Gibbs said, \"gratuitous and provocative, designed to provoke a retrial of Mr Harwood on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/19/simon-harwood-not-guilty-ian-tomlinson\" title=\"\">charges on which he has already been acquitted</a>\".</p> <p>The disciplinary panel, comprising two senior Met officers, Commander Julian Bennett and Chief Superintendant Wayne Chance, and a lay member, Andrew Lowe, adjourned to discuss the matter.</p> <p>The cause of death may be just one element in a series of actions comprising an A4 printed page that the disciplinary panel say amounted to gross misconduct, but it is likely to be a crucial one for Tomlinson's family.</p> <p>The 47-year-old died shortly after Harwood struck him on the leg with a baton and pushed him to the ground as he tried to make his way home past police lines following a day of protests connected to the G20 meeting on 1 April 2009. An initial postmortem examination said Tomlinson, who was a long-term alcoholic, died of natural causes.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2012/jul/19/simon-harwood-ian-tomlinson-video\" title=\"\">video footage, handed to the Guardian</a> by someone observing the incident, showed Harwood's actions. Two further postmortem examinations said the cause of Tomlinson's death was internal bleeding caused by his falling to the pavement after the push.</p> <p>An inquest in 2011 recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. However the trial, which ended in July, cleared Harwood of manslaughter. The riot police officer accepted that in retrospect his actions were excessive but said that at the time he felt threatened following a day of widespread disorder.</p> <p>The verdict dismayed Tomlinson's widow, Julia, and children, who feel the contradictory verdicts have left them in a legal limbo.</p> <p>The trial jury was not told details of Harwood's past record, notably that he quit the Met on health grounds in 2001 shortly before an earlier planned disciplinary hearing into claims he illegally tried to arrest a driver after a road rage incident while off duty, altering his notes to retrospectively justify his actions. Harwood was nonetheless able to join another force, Surrey, before returning to serve with the Met in 2005. The 45-year-old also allegedly punched, throttled, kneed or threatened other suspects while in uniform during other incidents. Most of the complaints were unproven.</p> <p>The disciplinary hearing, which was postponed until after the trial, said Harwood's actions on the day amounted to gross misconduct over four standards of expected professional behaviour: authority, respect and courtesy; use of force; orders and instructions; and discreditable conduct.</p> <p>It is only the second time the Independent Police Complaints Commission has instructed police to hold a disciplinary hearing in public following a law passed in 2008.</p> <p>The only other public hearing concerned officers accused of failing in their duty when they did not respond to repeated calls from Colette Lynch, a young woman in Rugby, Warwickshire, after threats from her former partner. He stabbed her to death days later.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Vodafone</strong> shares have fallen back following reports it is planning to make a $2.2bn provision against possible Indian tax liabilities.</p> <p>In January the mobile operator won a court ruling against the Indian government's demand for payments relating to the company's purchase in 2007 of Hutchison Whampoa's operations in the country. Following the defeat, the Indian government amended the law to apply it retroactively, which could yet leave Vodafone liable.</p> <p>The company had so far resisted setting aside a provision for any potential tax bill, but<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-16/vodafone-considers-2-2-billion-india-provision-after-law-change.html\" title=\"\"> chief financial officer Andy Halford has told Bloomberg </a>it may change its mind.</p> <p>The news has sent Vodafone 2.2p lower to 173.65, down more than 1%. Analysts at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> Vodafone has finally acknowledged that it is considering a provision for capital gains tax in India on its initial acquisition of the Hutchison stake in Hutchison-Essar. The company had dropped a fairly heavy hint at the first quarter results that it was considering this, and [Halford's] comments now make it more likely. <br> We have included a $2bn liability in our Vodafone model \u2013 equal to 2.5p per share - calculated using the officially reported liability of INR110bn (INR85bn tax plus INR25bn of interest). We note the total reported in the press has now reached $2.2bn, probably because of additional interest, but we won't change our estimate at this stage. In reality, the matter will likely be settled between Vodafone and the Indian tax authorities in our view, in which case we are likely to have over-estimated the amount in any case. </blockquote> <p>Among the other fallers, <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> is down 5.6p at 273.4p as Ian Gordon at Investec moved from hold to sell:</p> <blockquote> Despite wider events, the scale/pace of RBS' share price rally over the past two weeks has been impressive, almost matching resurgent Barclays. RBS continues to make good progress in terms of balance sheet repair, while other associated/helpful developments (e.g. fresh liability management to manage/optimise surplus liquidity) had already been well-flagged. However, with weak core profitability, and legacy bills to pay, the return on equity outlook appears simply too weak to support the current valuation. <br> As an aside, we also note the disposal of shares to a value of \u00a3576m by [executives] John Hourican and Paul Geddes last week at 246p-247p. </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Chemring</strong> has climbed 6.8p to 352.8p, awaiting bid developments. US private equity group Carlyle has received an extension until 12 October to decide whether or not to proceed with a bid for the defence company. Weekend reports suggested that Invesco, which holds more than 29% of Chemring was holding out for 450p a share.</p>",

  "<h2>A is for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GklWvhNqVvg\">Action</a> </h2> <p>The action, or hammer mechanism, is the defining development in the history of the piano. It is the complex mechanical balancing act connecting the pianist to the strings, from the key to the hammer, allowing minute control of loud and soft, allowing each pianist to express themselves in their own unique way. </p> <blockquote> <p>\"For me a great action is one that is totally responsive to every minute difference in touch that I give it, every tiny articulation, it's a piano on which everything I hear on my imagination first I can then produce.\" <em>Angela Hewitt</em> </p> </blockquote> <h2>B is for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9nO9Ro_kd4\">Boogie-Woogie</a> </h2> <p>This is an energetic and rhythmic style of piano playing that originated in the Southern States of America in the early 20th century. The rumbling left-hand rhythm was often used to evoke trains and railroad travel, and the buoyant energy of the music was popular to dance to in the juke joints and barrelhouses. Famous early exponents included Jelly Roll Morton, Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis. </p> <h2>C is for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqJQIERAdU0\">Competitions </a></h2> <p>Competitions are a vital part of many classical pianists' careers. They are a testing ground, and a way to get noticed in a crowded field. But are they an exciting way to make a name as a young musician, a necessary evil, or are they in fact not necessary at all? Guests this day will include leading pianists who give contrasting views for and against competitions: Stephen Hough thinks they're dreadful; Lucy Parham says they can be a great experience for a young musician; Pierre Laurent Aimard finds the idea of competing in an art form problematic.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You might be playing a Liszt Etude at nine in the morning after a bad sleep, on a piano you only had five minutes to try out\u2026 If you can get up and play well in a competition, that's the biggest test.\" <em>Angela Hewitt</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>D is for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1diZtD5_G0\">Duets</a> </h2> <p>The piano is rare in that it's an instrument that can be played by two people at the same time. The intimacy of sharing a stool and playing shoulder to shoulder can make for a very pleasant experience. And there are many great pieces of music composed for piano duet. Views from the stage and from the rehearsal room come from pianist David Owen Norris, and from duet partners Pascal and Ami Rog\u00e9, and the Lab\u00e8que sisters, who've played together since childhood, not always in complete harmony.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Faure's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcNHP12m-_g&amp;feature=related\">Dolly Suite</a> is a lovely piece for four hands one piano. We were fighting all the time. I was six and she was eight. And she was saying you are taking up all my space \u2013 we were pushing each other and my mother was in tears and totally in despair\u2026\" <em>Marielle Lab\u00e8que</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>E is for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVUIqMvcHlQ\">Encores</a> </h2> <p>There's an art to choosing and performing an encore, even for the world's top pianists. Being invited to return to the stage calls for a choice that complements but doesn't upstage the programme the audience have just heard. And it mustn't keep the orchestra sitting too long with nothing to do. It must be prepared and yet feel like a spontaneous treat. Above all, it's a pleasure; as Angela Hewitt says: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"It can be a wonderful moment. What is funny is when you've played some marvellous programme with marvellous works and really given all you have for two hours and somebody comes up and says, 'What I liked best was the encore'!\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>F is for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnfZjqMSy0&amp;feature=related\">Fingers</a> </h2> <p>The piano is an unusual musical instrument in that all ten digits of the performer can be used to sound different notes simultaneously (alternatively it can be played to perfection with just five - see <em>L is for Left-handed pianism</em> on 3 October). Fingers need practice, and practice makes perfect. Working hard to build strength and dexterity is part and parcel of every pianist's story, and just as in sport, exercises are a necessary evil. But what can start out as a chore when young can eventually become a pleasure when technique is more advanced and exercises turn into Chopin or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SvZyjKUGQ8\">Moskowski Etudes</a> \u2013 written and designed for developing technique but also being very beautiful music.</p> <h2>G is for<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/20/glenn-gould-wilfully-idiotic-genius\"> Glenn Gould</a> </h2> <p>Glenn Gould was a Canadian pianist who became one of the best-known and most celebrated classical pianists of the 20th century. He was particularly renowned as an interpreter of the keyboard music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Gould was well known for his unorthodox musical interpretations and mannerisms at the keyboard. He stopped giving concerts at the age of 31 to concentrate on studio recording and other projects. His story is told by his biographer Kevin Bazzana, with comment from pianists Murray Perahia, Stephen Hough and David Owen Norris, and violinist Gidon Kremer, who has just recorded an album of Bach arrangements in homage to Gould's performances of these works.<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>The word 'inimitable' really makes sense with Gould, and if he has a message it isn't 'be influenced by my interpretations' \u2013 his message is: 'be yourself; bring your own personality to the music you play'<br><em>Kevin Bazzana, biographer of Glenn Gould</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>H is for Hiring</h2> <p>Often when a concert pianist steps onto the stage to perform, they have to play a piano that has been hired. Surprisingly, while many are in great shape, sometimes they aren't. Sometimes they are appropriate for the repertoire about to be played and sometimes not. The challenge for the artist is to work out how to play this piano in such a way that the concert is the best it can be. How does a pianist coax a beautiful performance out of the hired concert grand? <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mss9x\">Also on this day on In Tune</a>, master piano technician Ulrich Gerhartz of Steinway's gives a backstage view of the delicate business of delivering and caring for these huge yet delicate instruments (four large men required to get them up staircases!) Every Steinway piano has its own character: one of his jobs is to match the piano to the individual player. These pianos are incredibly cosseted, painstaking cleaned and maintained, and on the concert day they're tuned twice \u2013 once for the rehearsal and once again before the concert. Ulrich compares it to a Formula One racing car, they are always being tweaked to maintain absolute peak performance.</p> <p>Concert pianist Jonathan Biss remembers a particular disaster playing a hired piano for a concert in Vermont: </p> <blockquote> <p><br>I was in Vermont, and the piano had been moved in a couple of days before. The rehearsal went fine, and the piano technician left before the concert started. I started playing and after three minutes, the lyre - that's the thing which holds the pedals - simply fell off. Someone forgot to replace a screw or two. I put my foot on the pedal and suddenly it wasn't there any more.</p> </blockquote> <h2>I is for<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvUbrbFdJ8g\"> Improvisation</a> </h2> <p>Some people can do it and some can't \u2013 sit down at the keyboard and simply make music up on the spur of the moment. The piano can be the perfect instrument for jazz improvising, capable of a vast range of sounds from the percussive to the lyrical. The left hand can be the rhythm section while the right provides melodic lines and \"choruses\". But there are many ways to improvise \u2013 classically trained players may choose to follow clear structures in improvising, for instance in the cadenza of a concerto; and jazz musicians will often have at least a fixed chord sequence from which to elaborate; whereas a silent film accompanist often improvises spontaneously to a film which may last for an hour or more, having never seen it before sitting down to perform to an audience of cinema-goers. And in the genre known as Free Improvisation, the pianist tries to avoid all pre-thought or pre-arranged structures, and be completely open to the ideas of the moment when hammer strikes string.</p> <blockquote> <p>The piano is great for improvising because it transcends different genres. It's a completely open book ,and there's such a wide range of emotions you can cover. <em>Jazz pianist Gwilym Simcock</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>J is for Jazz </h2> <p>Ever since the early ragtime of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Joplin\">Scott Joplin</a> and Jelly Roll Morton the piano has been a key instrument in the development of Jazz. Associated with the smoky bar-room, the instrument allows the jazz pianist to play all the elements of the band - stretching the harmony, roll a great rhythmic bottom-end, and improvise singing, soaring melodies. Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Herbie Hancock, among others, all stretched what the Jazz piano could do.</p> <blockquote> <p><br>The piano is the perfect jazz instrument, it can do everything, it can have a great bass sound to it, you can explore more extended harmony all on your own, and you can make it sing in so many different ways, so we're very lucky as piano players, we do get to have it all. <em>Gwilym Simcock</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>K is for <a href=\"http://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/piano-keyboard-diagram.html\">Keys</a></h2> <p>There are sad keys and glad keys, so they say; F sharp minor is turbulent and C major is sunny. Every pianist knows how a key feels under their fingers - every key has its own combination of black and white on the keyboard. Before the Baroque period, keyboards had to be re-tuned to play in each different keys. But with the development of the modern piano, so-called \"equal temperament\" evened out the differences between the keys. One great masterpiece represents this development \u2013 JS Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, which expresses his faith in the new tuning system by having pieces in all the 24 different major and minor keys. But another curious factor of keys still remains a problem \u2013 the fact that different countries tune their pianos to different pitches. So middle C is, for instance, a bit higher in Germany than in the UK. </p> <h2>L is for Left Hand</h2> <p>The right hand may be the belle of the ball but the left hand is no dowdy Cinderella. The left hand is a fundamental part of piano music \u2013 literally, the fundamental is the root part of every note on the piano.<br>A strong left hand is crucial to successfully playing Bach, but what motivates a pianist to tackle the fiendish work of Godowsky who transcribed the already difficult Chopin preludes for the left hand alone? For some, such as one-armed pianist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI7tnBmGnq4\">Paul Wittgenstein</a>, left-handed repertoire is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwNxn-iFRuI\">Nicholas McCarthy</a>'s - who was born without his right hand - only option. </p> <h2>M is for Movies</h2> <p>Piano improviser extraordinaire, <a href=\"http://harrythepiano.com/\">Harry the Piano</a>, silent film accompaniment specialist <a href=\"http://www.neilbrand.com/\">Neil Brand</a> and writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet \u2013 all experts in the field of film music \u2013 explore the role of the piano in movies, from the very first days of silent cinema, through <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hubyFqSUaGA\">Brief Encounter</a>'s immortalisation of Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto, to modern classics such as Michael Nyman's haunting music for The Piano.</p> <h2>N is for Novels</h2> <p>The piano has played a starring role in some the nation's best loved novels, acting as a signifier of everything from social class to seduction. On this day's In Tune, Professor John Mullan guides listeners through some of the most memorable novelistic piano moments, starting with Jane Austen's Persuasion - where the piano finds itself at the centre of a plot typically fraught with issues of class and gender, then on to Emily Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre, where Blanche Ingram puts the piano to use as a 19th century flirtation technique in her quest to impress the brooding Mr Rochester. In EM Forster's A Room with a View and Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty, it's the experience of listening to the piano \u2013 or not listening to it \u2013 that enables the novelists to shine a revealing light on their characters.</p> <h2>O is for Orchestra</h2> <p>How do you practice a concerto without an orchestra? Who controls a concerto - conductor or soloist? Are there any similarities between taking the role of soloist and sitting at the back as the anonymous orchestral pianist? Stephen Hough says: </p> <blockquote> <p>It's both like being a soloist, like playing a solo recital in that you have to have a very strong vision of the piece you're playing and sufficient personality and inner energy to convey that to the audience. But it's also chamber music, it's a shared experience\u2026 there have to be moments of dialogue. I think that's what makes the playing of a concerto a particular challenge, it's keeping the two things in balance. </p> </blockquote> <h2>P is for <a href=\"http://www.pianonoise.com/Article.Page-Turning.htm\">Page Turner</a></h2> <p>It should be simple. All you have to do is turn a page of a score while the pianist's hands are otherwise engaged. But page turning is fraught with difficulties, for both pianist and turner. What if you're turning pages and a bee flies into your shirt and stings you? What if you're playing and every time you need the page turned, the heaving embonpoint of your turner obscures your view of the music? Top of the list of Thankless Tasks, the essential but stressful job of page turning is only successful if it passes unnoticed.</p> <h2>Q for Queues</h2> <p>Which great pianists would be worth queuing for? Piano fans queued around the block in 1965, to see the return of Vladimir Horowitz, one of the century's most celebrated pianists, after a 12-year break from live performance. And in the age of internet booking, piano audiences are no less passionate. </p> <h2>R is for <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-repetiteur.htm\">R\u00e9p\u00e9titeur</a> </h2> <p>R\u00e9p\u00e9titeurs are so much more than just pianists. Sure, they have to be able to get around the keyboard. But they also have to be able to read the multiple lines of a full score, coach singers, take the role of an orchestra and, in a nutshell, know the opera they are rehearsing probably better than anyone else involved in the process. And those are just some of the musical skills. Because a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur must also be at once musically self-effacing, a linguist and a diplomat who can accommodate and reconcile the often conflicting demands of singers, conductors and directors. But, despite all that, there's no first-night curtain call for this vital figure.</p> <h2>S for Sustain</h2> <p>The sustain pedal, usually the one on the right, is the most commonly used pedal in a modern piano. When pressed it sustains all the damped strings on the piano by moving the dampers away from the strings and allowing them to vibrate freely so all the notes being played will continue to sound until the pedal is released. Until the Romantic era of Chopin and Liszt it was considered a special effect, but in the 19th century it came to be regarded as an essential element of piano sound. Pianist Stephen Hough says the sustain pedal itself is \"as important as the strings, the hammers, the keys of the piano \u2013 without it the instrument doesn't exist.\" </p> <h2>T for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjZIwxrY3Ss\">Tuning</a></h2> <p>The issue of tuning has been a live one ever since Greek mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras was pinching strings and scratching his head over harmonic discrepancies 2,500 years ago. For a keyboard instrument such as the piano with its multiple strings, until the system of Well Temperament was popularised in the early 18th century, instruments would only really sound good tuned to a certain key. Thanks to the Well-Tempered method of tuning though, and yes, Bach knew what he was doing when he wrote that collection of pieces in all 24 keys to be played on the same instrument, the pianist now has freedom to transpose freely across the keyboard. Yet, piano tuning is a highly nuanced art, affecting the tone and colour of an instrument. With razor-sharp hearing and an ability to creatively play with the compromises necessary to tune a piano, the piano tuner still plays a key role in preparing an instrument for performance. </p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"I've learnt a lot about tuning over the years, that there isn't one set tuning, a gifted tuner will do a different tuning depending on the repertoire I play, a different tuning for Bach than Ravel, it can be a very creative thing. Tuning can totally change the sound of a piano, in fact most of the sound colour of a piano comes from the tuning\u2026 you can do a lot with the tuning, creating resonances and harmonics in the piano, and a lot of people don't realise that.\" <em>Angela Hewitt</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>U for Upright</h2> <p>\"A sort of musical fungus attached to the walls of semi\u00addetached houses in the provinces\" is how celebrated conductor and fount of bons mots <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Beecham\">Sir Thomas Beecham</a>.</p> <h2>V for Virtuoso</h2> <p>Virtuoso is a term applied to many of the world's top pianists of today. With its roots in the Italian usage of the 16th and 17th centuries, a virtuoso is an individual who possesses outstanding technical ability in any intellectual or artistic field. But it takes much more than just playing demi-semi quavers on a keyboard to dazzle an audience. So what are the true qualities of virtuosity and which particular composers are regarded as virtuosi, writing music to show off their own technical prowess at the keyboard?</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Clara Schumann and Liszt were the first big virtuosos who played technically brilliant pieces... the word denotes a huge personality also: panache on stage, histrionics when you're not on stage \u2013 Liszt certainly was, with fainting women and so on. <em>Angela Hewitt</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>W for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAInt7hIZlU\">Workshops</a></h2> <p>What goes into the making of a piano? How do the pianos of today differ from those which Liszt or Debussy might have played? In the central London workshop of Steinway's, there are stripped down pianos everywhere, skeletons with their strings and frames exposed, and benches with vices and chisels like any carpenter would use. The scene is much like it would have been a hundred years ago, and Steinway still employs apprentices who are trained in the craft and art of piano maintenance.<br>Ulrich Gerhartz, their Director of Concerts and Artist Services explains what goes into the crafting of Steinway's delicately balanced instruments, and pianist Stephen Hough reflects on how changes in the manufacture of pianos means that the sounds he makes today are very different from the virtuosi of the past.</p> <h2>X for X-treme</h2> <p>Although every instrument has a history of extreme techniques, the piano seems to have attracted more than its fair share of people wanting to see how far it, and they, could go. From Beethoven, who was known for destroying pianos during the course of a performance, through to John Cage (who invented the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXAUEuECqQ\">prepared piano</a> by inserting screws, rubbers and bolts into it) and beyond, this episode of the Piano A\u2013Z is not for those of a sensitive disposition.</p> <h2>Y for Yellow River</h2> <p>In 1969 at the height of the Chinese Cultural Revolution the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River_Piano_Concerto\">Yellow River Piano Concerto</a>, commissioned by Madame Mao, received its highly politicised premiere. Despite being banned from Chinese musical life in 1976 it has slowly filtered back into the musical mainstream in a country with a huge affinity with the piano today. To say that 30 million Chinese school children are learning to play the instrument is a conservative estimate: some say the figure is as high as 90 million. For the Chinese the piano has become a potent symbol of the importance of hard work and dedication, as well as the perfect instrument for the one-child family system.</p> <p>Nobody embodies the piano in China more than global superstar <a href=\"http://www.langlang.com/\">Lang Lang</a>. </p> <blockquote> <p>It's kind of like football... piano has become the most popular fashionable instrument to learn. And as China opens up, gradually the piano has become important for people to understand Western culture. <em>Lang Lang</em></p> </blockquote> <p><br>Pianist Fou Ts'Ong, whose parents were imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, and conductor Jindong Cai also discuss the changing image of the piano in China since the days of Madame Mao.</p> <h2>Z for Zany</h2> <p>The alphabetical exploration of the piano concludes with Z for Zany, an affectionate look at the role of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuWUp1M-vuM&amp;feature=related\">piano in comedy</a>.

  "<p>Violent rage over an anti-Islam film has spread to Kabul, with hundreds of people taking to the city's streets, where they burned tyres and a car, and attacked police and a US base with stones.</p> <p>It was the fourth day of protests in Afghanistan, but they had been largely peaceful until Monday, with the capital spared the rioting that spread across the Middle East in response to Innocence of Muslims, a film that denigrates Islam and the prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>\"The people are going to raise their voice to show we are not silent. With the last breath in our body we will be against those who are insulting to our religion and prophet,\" said Haji Samar Gul, an 80-year-old protester at the Kabul demonstration. \"We shouted death to America, death to supporters of America, death to slaves of America.\"</p> <p>A few protesters carried guns, and eyewitnesses claimed they opened fire several times, but police said they resisted responding with their own weapons even though officers were injured by rocks.</p> <p>\"The police did not open fire at all, we used other techniques to control the protest,\" said the city police chief, Ayub Salangi, who was among those hit by the protesters.</p> <p>\"There were protests in four places around the city; more than 2,500 people participated. The police managed to control them, although they burned one vehicle.\"</p> <p>The groups gathered as early as 6am, with some protesters coming from villages on the city outskirts.</p> <p>\"I joined with them because I thought it was my duty as a Muslim to condemn those who made this film,\" said Waleed Khan, a 35-year-old from eastern Paktia, where insurgent violence is much higher than in the relatively secure capital.</p> <p>\"My relatives who are in Paktia were filled with anti-government and anti-American feeling when they heard about this film,\" he added.</p> <p>Fire engines stood by to douse flames, including in one shop that was set on fire, but the protests appear to have ended without deaths or significant injuries, unlike previous violent protests against the burning of copies of the Qur'an by a US pastor and US troops, when several people died.</p> <p>Many of those killed then are believed to have been hit by police bullets, and human rights groups said the decision to hold fire, if confirmed, was unprecedented and encouraging.</p> <p>\"The Afghan police, who in the past have often responded to unruly crowds with gunfire, seem to have taken a much more restrained and professional approach today,\" said Heather Barr, Afghanistan analyst at Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>\"Police reportedly did not open fire on protesters and used crowd control techniques instead. If this is true, it represents an important improvement in Afghan policing and the police leadership deserve appreciation for defusing what could have been an incident with a significant body count.\"</p>",

She said: \"What we've been doing with Nice is to help develop the processes they will use for developing practice guidance and quality standards.</p> <p>\"Social care is completely new and different for them. We're helping them to engage with a social care audience \u2014 who the key stake holders are, what language to use.

  "<p>There is going to be a mighty battle between Richard Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell (N&amp;S) and Independent News &amp; Media (INM) if Desmond goes ahead with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/16/irish-daily-star-fears-closure-richard-desmond\">his threat to close down the Irish Daily Star.</a></p> <p>INM believes closure of the paper, because of its publication of topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge, is \"disproportionate\", <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2012/0917/1224324092507.html\">reports the Irish Times</a>.</p> <p>Though the Dublin-based publisher said the matter warranted \"immediate investigation\", which is under way, it believed termination of the title would be \"disproportionate to a poor editorial decision\". It would result in the loss of up to 120 jobs.</p> <p>That decision to publish the pictures, which was apparently taken by the editor Mike O'Kane, was reported to have been made without reference to the senior managements of either INM or N&amp;S. </p> <p>The Irish Daily Star is a joint venture dating back to 1987, 13 years before N&amp;S acquired control of Express Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Star titles. </p> <p>INM was then run by Tony O'Reilly, who was succeeded by his son, Gavin. But he departed earlier this year after media tycoon Denis O'Brien became the largest shareholder and insisted on changes at board level.</p> <p>Since then, continuing company upheaval means that editors of INM titles have tended to operate without traditional management control or, in the words of one insider, any effective control whatsoever. Aside from budgets, there has been little editorial oversight.</p> <p>The managing director of the division responsible for the Irish Daily Star is Ger Colleran, a former editor of the paper. <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/national-news/irish-star-future-under-threat-from-kate-middleton-topless-shots-3230143.html\">He spoke to INM's Sunday Independent </a>in support of the editor's decision, implying that he had been consulted by O'Kane prior to publication.</p> <p>Colleran is quoted as saying: \"What we do in the Irish Daily Star is to produce an Irish newspaper for an Irish audience. The photographs of images taken from the magazine were not printed in our Belfast edition and there were two reasons for that -- sensitivity to our British partners, Express Newspapers, and a slightly different legal regime.\"</p> <p>He said he was \"surprised about the furore... particularly in a British media that gave freedom of speech to the world and is rightly called the Mother of Parliaments, underwritten by freedom of expression and a free press.\"</p> <p>The Irish Daily Star published reproductions of pages from French Closer magazine, which included 10 grainy shots of Prince William and his wife sunbathing on the balcony of a villa in Provence.</p> <p>If Desmond does pursue his closure threat, the Irish Times's business affairs correspondent, Ciar\u00e1n Hancock, <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0917/1224324092377.html\">argues that he may face \"significant hurdles.\"</a></p> <p>The Irish Daily Star operates in Dublin under INM's umbrella under a licence from NS that does not expire until 2037. The contract between the two companies allows each of them to give notice to the other of an intention to withdraw.</p> <p>But to executive a sudden exit from the agreement is fraught with legal problems, not least the problems caused by making about 80 full-time staff redundant.</p> <p>Aside from redundancy payments, Hancock also says there would be \"significant costs incurred\" in N&amp;S terminating the printing contract with INM and the lease of its offices in Dublin.</p> <p>That said, Desmond does hold a strong hand because N&amp;S controls the trademark of the Star title and a great deal of sport, celebrity news and features material is supplied by the London-based Daily Star. </p> <p>Both INM and N&amp;S jointly agreed last year to stop publishing the Irish Daily Star on Sunday for financial reasons. But the daily title does make money.</p> <p>According to the latest accounts for the division known as Independent Star Ltd, in 2010 it made a pretax profit of \u20ac4.3m (\u00a33.5m) on turnover of \u20ac40.6m (\u00a332.9m). Its profits declined by 11.4 per cent that year.</p> <p>Though figures for 2011 have yet to be published, informed sources cited by Hancock estimate that the accounts would show a decline in profits of between 8 and 10%. In 2010, the company paid a dividend of \u20ac4.55m (\u00a33.7m) jointly to INM and NS.</p> <p>The Irish Daily Star sells about 70,000 copies a day in the Republic and has been losing circulation in line with the market.</p> <p><em><strong>Footnote:</strong></em> The code administered by the Irish Press Council states that \"taking photographs of individuals in private places without their consent is not acceptable, unless justified by the public interest\".</p> <p>The Irish Daily Star signed up to that code when the council was set up in January 2008. At the time of writing, no complaint had been received.</p> <p><em><strong>A footnote to the footnote:</strong></em> I'm not quite sure what Ger Colleran means by his reference to \"a slightly different legal regime\" in Ireland as distinct from Britain. Both have incorporated the human rights convention into their laws.</p>",
  "<p>How convenient for Europe's increasingly vocal far-right that the continent's probable first black political leader has a criminal conviction. France's Front National (FN) was delighted to describe <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9542218/French-Socialist-becomes-first-black-leader-of-mainstream-European-party.html\" title=\"\">Harlem D\u00e9sir</a> as an \"ex-convict\" when he was named as the official candidate to replace Martine Aubry as leader of the country's governing Socialist party (PS) on 13 September.</p> <p>They were referring, with obvious glee, to the suspended 18-month sentence and 30,000-franc fine handed down to 52-year-old D\u00e9sir in 1998 for accepting an illegal payment from an organisation providing professional training to immigrants.</p> <p>Funding scandals among public figures are depressingly common in France nowadays. Jacques Chirac, president until 2007, was convicted of fraud last year, while the former prime minister Dominique de Villepin found himself in police custody this week facing a similar allegation. Nicolas Sarkozy, who stepped down as president this year, is under investigation for allegedly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/loreal-nicolas-sarkozy-bettencourt\" title=\"\">accepting huge amounts of cash from Liliane Bettencourt</a>, the L'Or\u00e9al heiress, in return for tax breaks.</p> <p>The difference, of course, is that the crimes of white, entitled politicians are seen as par for the course among France's notoriously corrupt governing class, while the past misdemeanors of a black man from immigrant stock are trumpeted from the rooftops. How, asks the Front National, can a man who changed his name from Jean-Philippe to Harlem in homage to radical African-American political leaders be a true Frenchman? How can the son of a West Indian father and a Jewish mother take over a position traditionally occupied by future French presidents, including the Socialist legend Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and the incumbent, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande?</p> <p>D\u00e9sir, who is almost certain to be named first secretary of the PS at the annual party conference in October, may be delighted by such criticism from the FN, but there are numerous opponents within his own party who are also fierce critics. Rather than a future leader who will emerge as a Gallic Obama, they view D\u00e9sir as a very average administrator who is being propelled to high office for reasons of political correctness alone.</p> <p>In a country that did not even have a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/sep/20/france.broadcasting\" title=\"\">black national newsreader until 2004</a>, non-white faces remain few and far between in all corners of public life, not least in politics. The secular republic is officially colour-blind, but everything from the national assembly and the boardrooms of its top companies to prime-time chat shows are noticeably devoid of people from African or Caribbean backgrounds and other ethnic minorities. Official reports regularly highlight the fact that some 15% of the population are of non-European origin. It is these 5 million people that Ms Aubry and the prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, had in mind when they instructed 175,000 PS members to endorse D\u00e9sir as their leader next month.</p> <p>D\u00e9sir's expected shoo-in does not mean that racial minorities have moved up the socio-economic ladder: the vast majority still live in deprived out-of-town housing estates. This was just one of the reasons D\u00e9sir started his career in the 1980s as a revolutionary Trotskyite and hardline anti-racism campaigner.</p> <p>Like so many other young idealists who find themselves having to work within established political parties \u2013 he set up his own in the 1990s before joining the PS \u2013 D\u00e9sir has changed, but France has not. As Sarkozy did before him, President Hollande is presiding over a party that wants to promote ethnic minorities by appointing selected individuals, while ignoring the communities from which they come. In the same way that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/20/rachida-dati-france-sarkozy-pregnant\" title=\"\">Rachida Dati</a>, a conservative from a north African immigrant background, was ridiculously over-promoted by Sarkozy to become justice minister, so D\u00e9sir, who is not even an MP, will find himself woefully out of his depth as first secretary of a party that dominates both houses of parliament and councils nationwide .</p> <p>D\u00e9sir's appointment will do nothing to address the chronic problems of prejudice and economic underachievement that members of ethnic minorities have to deal with day in, day out. His nomination is an act of heavy-handed, cynical politicking, which says everything about the state of race relations in modern France.</p>",
  "<p>Italy's Chi magazine pushed ahead with its plan to publish a series of topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge on Monday, complete with a curt dismissal of the protests raised by the royal family.</p> <p>The magazine published 18 photographs spread over 19 pages of the royal couple sunbathing at a villa in southern France after the editor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alfosignorini/status/247237366476066816\" title=\"\">Alfonso Signorini, tweeted</a> over the weekend that \"not even a direct call from the Queen\" would stop him.</p> <p>The photo sequence is no more compromising that the pictures <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/14/kate-middleton-topless-pictures-palace-lawyers?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">published last week by French magazine Closer</a>, and show the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of the villa.

  "<p>Might Royal Mail's plans to leave your parcels with a neighbour if you're out be a breach of your human rights? I don't usually answer readers' queries but this one struck me as intriguing.</p> <p>The reader, who has asked me not to identify him for reasons that will become clear, is concerned about <a href=\"http://www.royalmail.com/delivery-neighbour/faqs/faqs\" title=\"\">new arrangements for undeliverable items</a> that Royal Mail is planning to \"roll out\" across the UK later this month. The changes are subject to approval by Ofcom. But the regulator believes that failure to grant approval would leave Royal Mail at a competitive disadvantage: it is the only major postal delivery company in the UK that is not allowed to deliver to neighbours as part of its standard delivery practice. Although the consultation ended only last week, Ofcom said in its <a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/royal-mail-delivery-neighbour/summary/condoc.pdf\" title=\"\">consultation document</a> that it was proposing to give its approval.</p> <p>So we can be pretty sure the changes will go ahead. Delivery staff will then be able to leave undeliverable items with someone who lives \"sufficiently close by\". You'll get a P739 card through the door telling you which neighbour it is.</p> <p>In a leaflet sent to all addresses, Royal Mail says the new scheme will apply to \"items that don't fit through your letter box\". It adds: \"this does not apply to standard size letters\". But Royal Mail's application to Ofcom \u2014 and Ofcom's draft approval \u2014 also covers \"first class\" and \"second class\" services. There would be no point in leaving a letter with a neighbour if it's small enough to go through the door. But this provision will allow neighbours to take in letters that were sent using the \"recorded signed for\" service and need a signature. It will not apply to the special delivery service.</p> <p>Many people, especially those in rural areas, may prefer all this to the alternative of queuing up for a parcel at the delivery office. It is certainly preferable to what Royal Mail refers to as the current \"abuse\" of the P739 scheme \u2014 where the postal worker makes no attempt to deliver a parcel and instead leaves a card alleging, untruthfully, that the potential recipient was out at the time.</p> <p>Others will not want their mail delivered to anyone else. They can request a small sticker which needs to be displayed near their letterbox. It says: \"please return items you can't deliver to the delivery office\".</p> <p>The catch is that it works both ways. If you don't want to be bothered by taking in parcels for half the street, you can't ask for the occasional parcel to be left next door. And if you don't want your own packages delivered to your nosy neighbours, you have to display a sticker announcing that you are not prepared to take in their post either.</p> <p>That's what concerns my reader. He asks,</p> <blockquote> \"What happens, if you have a neighbour with whom you have an especially bad relationship and to whom you would on no account wish to have your post delivered, while being perfectly happy to participate in the scheme in relation to all your other neighbours? The neighbour in question might be malicious and even, in some instances, dangerous.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>Well, you'd opt out of the scheme by putting the sticker on your letter-box.</p> <p>But the neighbour would see it and want to know why you were not prepared to take in his post. That could antagonise a \"disturbingly nasty\" neighbour, says my reader. And why should you have to advertise your wishes in this very public way? Surely it's a breach of your right to privacy? Indeed, doesn't article 8 of the human rights convention say that \"everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence\"?</p> <p>Indeed it does, but it goes on to list a number of exceptions. And allowing your neighbours to see that you have bought a book from Amazon is not quite what the draftsman meant by limiting interference with your correspondence.</p> <p>\"Royal Mail does not believe that the proposed Delivery to Neighbour service is in breach of any legislation,\" a spokesman assured me. \"We are actively engaged with Ofcom in plans for the roll-out of this service, which many other postal operators already provide, but which up to now Royal Mail has not had regulatory authority to offer.\"</p> <p>I'm inclined to agree with Royal Mail's view of the law. But then I have good neighbours and enjoy an excellent postal delivery service. I also have a letterbox large enough to take books. I'm not at all sure how I'd feel if I lived next door to the neighbour from hell.</p>",
  "<p>Giving birth is a heady, joyful experience, one to be shared with doting family members and congratulatory friends. You're supposed to feel like a mother immediately and it's supposed to come completely naturally, right?</p> <p>Right. Except when it doesn't.</p> <p>For 32-year-old Sarah* it didn't. Despite having two children already, nothing could have prepared her for the overwhelming baby blues she felt when her new baby came.</p> <p>\"In the run-up to giving birth everything was lovely,\" she says, \"we were all excited and everything went smoothly and my baby boy was healthy.\"</p> <p>But after a couple of days she started feeling the baby blues. \"My health visitor said the feelings would soon pass and I believed her.\" But they didn't. \"I didn't want to go anywhere. I felt like a failure; the worst mum ever.\"</p> <p>Luckily for Sarah she was referred to her local perinatal project and a group of like-minded mums. The group, run by the West Mansfield Perinatal Support Project, proved to be a crucial lifeline for Sarah.</p> <p>The project was set up two years ago at the West Mansfield Sure Start children's centre after manager Claire Meek started noticing a high level of referrals to support mothers with mental health issues.</p> <p>Mansfield is among the 10% most deprived areas of England. Meek says, \"Around 50-60% of the referrals were to do with social isolation and mothers' mental health state. That's where it started.\"</p> <p>At the same time, Family Action's fundraising team were considering putting in a National Lottery bid for its Perinatal Support Project and the whole thing came together.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.family-action.org.uk/home.aspx?id=11578\" title=\"\">Family Action</a> works with 45,000 children and families a year providing practical, emotional and financial support through more than 100 services based in communities across England. The Family Action Perinatal Support Project was established at four sites across the UK in 2010. A total of 86 volunteer befrienders have been recruited and trained.</p> <p>The West Mansfield project is led by perinatal co-ordinator Julie Smith, who has a background in early years and children's centre leadership. It's run from the children's centre by a small steering group comprising Meek, a midwifery manager and counsellor, along with 11 \"utterly essential\" volunteer befrienders, often women who have been through similar experiences.</p> <p>The team has 14 cases open at the moment and usually has anything from nine to 14 on the go. \"Some of them just have group support,\" explains Meek, \"Others have something more comprehensive.\"</p> <p>It's this bespoke nature of the support that ensures its success, Meek thinks. \"Sometimes it's just the knowledge that there is support available. Sometimes it's being able to go to the same place at the same time every week and sometimes it's more complicated than that.\"</p> <p>Gill Bradford is a counsellor working with the project and training the volunteers. Her services range from small bespoke groups (she recently deliberately put four women together who she thought would get on like a house on fire \u2013 they did) to cognitive behaviour therapy training and short courses.</p> <p>The service lasts as long as it needs to and assessment and sign-off are agreed mutually. \"It's important that we don't create a co-dependency,\" says Meek. \"We want them to feel they have the confidence to carry on.\"</p> <p>Of course, measuring wellbeing both in the first place and after intervention is hard. But the team use a number of scaling systems including the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, which asks the mother about emotional warmth between her and the baby and general mood. But, as Meek admits: \"Wellbeing is so subjective it is hard to really gauge, but we carefully observe feelings of attachment and mood improvement.\"</p> <p>An evaluation of the Perinatal Support Project, published this month by Warwick Medical School, suggests that more than two-thirds of the women served by the four projects live in no-wage households, one-third are lone parents and between 2% and 11% have children on the child-protection register or with a child-protection plan, in addition to the presenting problems.</p> <p>The evaluation also found significant improvements in anxiety and depression, social support and self-esteem as well as significant improvement in the mother's relationship with the baby.</p> <p>The support offered, Meek stresses, is not a top-end, specialist service but in some ways it's more important than that: \"We are doing really crucial intervention work, trying to stop things before they escalate.\"</p> <p>Bradford adds: \"In this area we have a really good perinatal psychiatric team. But they take on people who are very ill and so there is a gap for those women who don't meet the criteria for those services but have an unmet need.\"</p> <p>Beth* was one such woman. \"My health visitor referred me after 14 months of me going through hell,\" she says. \"She didn't pick up on my need [at first] but I was very good at hiding it too. If she had probed more I may well have cracked. It was my second child so she thought I would probably be OK.\" Assumptions like this are partly down to time constraints, says Meek. \"We have a fantastic team of health visitors here and they are very much involved but they are incredibly stretched and they have little quality time. They come in and then they're off and you can sense that pressure of trying to contain their workload.\"</p> <p>Beth's experience with the project has been so positive that she's now a befriender herself and is starting a social work degree next year. \"It's changed my life,\" she says simply. Sarah adds, \"It was the hand that brought me out of the darkness, the hand that wiped my tears, held me up when I was weak and encouraged me to just be me. Like a mum.\"</p> <p><em>* Names have been changed</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>There is widespread agreement that our systems of health and social care can no longer adequately meet the needs and expectations of the increasing number of people living into old age.</p> <p>Across the globe, countries are responding in different ways to this challenge, and that difference is also apparent between England and Scotland, which offers an intriguing \"policy laboratory\" on \"what works\".</p> <p>The English approach has been developed over the past two decades and is now reaching its denouement under the coalition: the deepening split between purchasers and providers; the creation of an internal market followed by the shift towards 'real' markets underpinned by competition law; and the encouragement of the private sector in both providing and commissioning healthcare.</p> <p>Some see this as a prelude to the end of state-funded universal healthcare and the creation of an insurance-based system. The appointment of Jeremy Hunt as health secretary will do nothing to assuage such fears.</p> <p>We do not have to go far, however, to see an alternative model. The Scots have never had much truck with healthcare markets, even before devolution. The creation of separate NHS trusts and foundation trusts has been firmly resisted, as has GP fundholding and its subsequent variations.</p> <p>Since devolution, the two countries have gone in very different policy directions, and the best example of this is the current focus on integrated care (rather than markets) in Scotland as the solution to meeting patient needs.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http:/ /www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0039/00392579.pdf\" title=\"\">consultation on proposals to develop integrated care</a> was published earlier this year with a deadline of 11 September to submit responses. Legislation is expected to follow and this will be a flagship policy for Alex Salmond's government.</p> <p>Those involved on the ground are greatly exercised about the practicalities, and much political kudos will ride on being able to show the Scottish way can work better than Cameron's rolling back of the state. But will it?</p> <p>The rhetoric around integration is also loud in England. What appears to be different is the seriousness with which the endeavour is regarded. In England the policy focus on integration only arose belatedly and reluctantly as Andrew Lansley was forced to \"pause\" his market-led reforms and genuflect to the messages from the NHS Future Forum.</p> <p>Few doubt that the real action is around markets and competition, with only a handful of establishment thinktanks touting the view that competition and collaboration make comfortable bedfellows.</p> <p>The emphasis in Scotland is very different. The proposals include nationally agreed outcomes that will apply across health and social care \u2013 unlike the disjointed outcomes frameworks in England, a requirement to introduce integrated budgets will apply across health and social care, which will ensure new health and social care partnerships are jointly accountable to ministers, local authority leaders and the public for delivery of outcomes.</p> <p>However, the jury is out on whether this model will deliver.</p> <p>The proposals will also doubtless alter in detail in the light of the consultation process, and these changes won't be introduced for a good two or three years.</p> <p>Top-down prescription can never be sufficient to guarantee effective local partnering (as the consultation paper acknowledges) but what it can do is create a context within which partnering is more, rather than less, likely to flourish.</p> <p>Much will depend on political impetus and here the loss of Nicola Sturgeon from her role as cabinet secretary for health and wellbeing to head up the independence referendum is significant \u2013 her successor, Alex Neil, has a hard act to follow.</p> <p>As the policy forms, the key considerations will be structure and culture. The current proposals for new structures and governance arrangements will inevitably be unsettling to some and will attract resistance.</p> <p>Indeed, the idea that the integrated budgets will somehow constitute a blank cheque that will drive change and innovation has to be questioned; as long as health and social care are in different organisations there will always be tensions around where the money goes.</p> <p>The only way to address this is by a firm focus on cultural change. This is partly about clear management and political leadership, but also about arguing the case for change with professionals, patients and the public.</p> <p>It means \u2013 importantly \u2013 central and local politicians acknowledging that some services will need to be decommissioned, albeit in the face of popular opposition. Partnership working for the sake of it, with no improved end product will simply be an expensive distraction.</p> <p>But more fundamentally, what is at stake here is a battle for the soul of public service delivery and ideas around collective solidarity. The policy divergence on integration versus markets is really a question about how we want to live together as a society.</p> <p>There is more at stake here than meets the eye, and for this reason alone we must hope Scotland can rise to the challenge.</p> <p><em>Bob Hudson is a professor at the</em><a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/sass/\" title=\"\"><em> school of applied social sciences at the University of Durham</em></a></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers. </strong></p>",
  "<p>Let's face it, humanitarian assistance is in a mess: increasingly reactive and politicised, ignoring emergencies that are out of the media spotlight, and \"poorly co-ordinated and poorly integrated\" when the system does respond, to quote the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/development/evaluationofdevelopmentprogrammes/dcdndep/48373454.pdf\" title=\"\">most rigorous assessment of earthquake relief in Haiti</a>.</p> <p>Thousands of NGOs compete for money that \u2013 usually too little and too late \u2013 is delivered by donors entangled in bureaucracy and obsessed with branding and control. The result is that everybody loses, especially those most in need on the ground. But, complaints apart, what are NGOs doing to invent a better system?</p> <p>Any change is risky, since emergency funds are critical to the survival of most international NGOs. Getting reliable figures is notoriously difficult, but humanitarian income from all sources usually accounts for 40-75% of total income. Of Save the Children UK's overall spend last year, 66% was labelled humanitarian, as was 43% of Oxfam's.</p> <p>In this context, shaking up the world of humanitarian assistance carries an obvious threat to NGO self-interest, so the incentives for reform are not exactly strong. Emergencies are central to the business plans of NGOs, whose brands shine more brightly amid the suffering of others.</p> <p>So, it is all the more remarkable that a group of British NGOs has put together proposals that promise to blow this logic apart. Their \"big idea\" is to establish a <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/45460733\" title=\"\">new emergency response fund</a> that would act like a bank in channeling help \u2013 wherever and whenever it is needed \u2013 to frontline agencies, without having to apply afresh for \"credit\" for every new disaster.</p> <p>By creating a firewall between the interests of donors and the needs of those on the ground, NGOs and other implementers would be able to get resources to the sharp end of the system quickly and efficiently. They would also be able to improve the quality and sustainability of emergency assistance, and build the capacity of local groups to take on more of the work themselves so that, when disaster strikes again, less outside help would be required. Indeed, local groups would be encouraged to apply for support directly, cutting out their northern NGO intermediaries.</p> <p>The idea of a standing fund for emergencies isn't new; the <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/cerf/\" title=\"\">UN already has one, </a>and the <a href=\"http://www.dec.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Disasters Emergency Committee pulls together UK appeals</a>. But the former is vulnerable to political pressures and inefficient administration, while the latter only responds to high-profile cases. By contrast, instead of competing for resources handed out by a web of government and private donors, all with their own different criteria, the NGO proposal suggests making decisions based on peer review by the fund's implementing agencies, using a unitary framework focused solely on quality, need and impact.</p> <p>Theoretically, therefore, Oxfam, Christian Aid or anyone else could be declined or thrown out if they fail to perform effectively. According to <a href=\"http://www.seanlowrie.com/about/)\" title=\"\">Sean Lowrie</a>, who sits at the middle of this collaborative from a base at Save the Children, a small-scale pilot version of the fund has already been tested successfully with support from the UK's Department for International Development (DfID).</p> <p>A fund like this faces lots of questions about how it would actually work and be governed, but, by breaking out of the \"boom and bust\" cycle that bedevils NGOs and other agencies, it could provide a real step forward in reversing the dysfunctional nature of the current international system. It might serve another purpose, too, by encouraging NGOs to jettison the bad habits encouraged by over-competition and short-term funding so they can finally bring their emergency work in line with their advocacy for long-term, participatory development.</p> <p>At a time when some NGOs appear to be backsliding into the use of \"disaster porn\" to increase their market share, it is vital that counter-pressures are ramped up to push them in the opposite direction. Only then will they be equal partners with groups on the ground attacking the root causes of insecurity and famine.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a new fund needs new funders who are prepared to break free of their bad habits by putting large-scale resources into mechanisms they trust but do not control. If it is right to ask NGOs to set aside some of their self-interest, then what about the donors? An emergency response fund governed by the needs of those at the sharp end of disasters poses a direct challenge to the influence of national interests, donor agendas, and the technocratic fixation on narrow measurements of accountability that permeate the ranks of government aid agencies and foundations.</p> <p>Reorienting humanitarian assistance in this way requires both NGOs and donors with bold vision as well as deep pockets. Any volunteers?</p>",
