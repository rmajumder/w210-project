  "<p>Much like Kenneth Tynan and Look Back in Anger \u2013 but without the intellect, insatiable cultural curiosity and immeasurable breadth of knowledge and living in hopelessly degraded rather than fearlessly innovative times \u2013 I could not love anyone who did not love Harry Hill. He is happiness made baldy flesh.</p> <p>The spoof documentary <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/whatever-happened-to-harry-hill\" title=\"\"><strong>Whatever Happened to Harry Hill?</strong></a> was part of the Funny Fortnight celebrating Channel 4's 30th birthday. This is the channel, of course, on which Hill first appeared, back in 1997. The aptly-named Harry Hill Show was a gallimaufry of inspired idiocy that introduced us to the ever-elusive badgers' parade, a blue rubber cat called Stouffer, the sight of Bert Kwouk (formerly Cato in the Inspector Clouseau films) as Harry's lacklustre chicken catcher, Mai Sung \u2013 Harry's wife and stealer of his Abbey National book and \u2026 well, look, if you weren't there, this will all be so much nonsense and if you were, you will know that the mere printed word cannot convey more than an ounce of the madness and delight that ensued.</p> <p>Whatever Happened to \u2026 was essentially a clips job, given shape by the conceit that the major players had all suffered a falling-out but were now hoping to get back together for one last show. Kwouk was the most resistant to this plan. \"For his impressions, Harry just put a wig on!\" he remembered, disgusted. \"He didn't even try to match the voice!\" Eventually, however, even he was convinced, and a glorious reunion \u2013 now that Harry has beaten the tawdry <a href=\"http://www.goodfishguide.co.uk/fish/herring-or-sild-169\" title=\"\">sild</a> addiction that finally did for the troupe \u2013 took place.</p> <p>If you were in a mind to be critical, you could say that the ratio of new material to clips, and the comparative levels of invention for each, were quite low. With links to match the generous and ebullient performances from the past, the whole thing could have sung, and better than Bert Kwouk doing Hey Little Hen. But you couldn't stay cross for long in the face of the Mattie Mince pledges (though \"that was the sild talking,\" Harry reveals bravely now), the tiny jockeys, Peter Dickinson in the badger grooming bay and other sketches of yesteryear unspooling, as insanely as ever, before you. Happiness would keep on breaking through.</p> <p>And speaking of insane happiness \u2013 Vic and Bob returned to our screens too, with another one-off show for the birthday celebrations. <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/vic-bobs-lucky-sexy-winners\" title=\"\"><strong>Vic &amp; Bob's Lucky Sexy Winners</strong></a> \u2013 a quiz show, at least technically \u2013 opened with our trouserless hosts sporting platform heels and dancing as ever, although this time literally, to the beat of their own drums. Then a cardboard cutout of Simon Cowell as drawn by Reeves atop a pair of human legs kicked a lever to activate the clock and guests Chelsee Healey, Thomas Turgoose and Eddie Izzard (\"Occupation?\" \"Spinster\") competed to answer questions such as \"Where is Antony Worrall Thompson \u2013 the moistest of the TV chefs \u2013 housed when not on TV?\" and win prizes that included an energy drink and some talcum powder in a jar (\"In a jar, in a jar, in a jar!\"). It occurred to me that, unless I blinked and missed it, Reeves and Mortimer were the only things missing (Harry Hill's TV Burp titles got a brief look-in) from the festival of bonkers Britishness that was the Olympics opening ceremony. Danny Boyle probably couldn't find a frame of their work from the moment The Smell Of \u2026 kicked off that wouldn't have finally tipped the whole fabulous, precariously balanced thing over into outright frothing madness incomprehensible across the globe.</p> <p>Like Hill, you either find them funny or you don't and the paltry resources of the written word cannot hope to transport you from the latter to the former camp. Even the news that AWT is housed in Glasgow University Hospital when not on TV may not sway you. But I laughed till I cried and begged whatever god is in charge of these things for a whole Lucky Sexy winning series. I type till then with fingers crossed.</p> <p>Amid such sparkling absurdity a third offering from Funny Fortnight, <a href=\"corner\" title=\"\"><strong>Just Around the Corner</strong></a>, lay like a damp squib. It is a comedy from Outnumbered creators Guy Jenkin and Andy Hamilton, about the Pilch family (Jameses Fleet and Bolam as son-and-father-in-law, and Jennie Jacques as Fleet's recalcitrant teenage daughter Kia), who live in what is now the isle of Norwich in a globally warmed and flooded Britain. The script was waterlogged, but much could be forgiven for Daisy Beaumont's shining turn as terrifying regional tyrant Big Delia. When paired with Fleet's peerless dithering, you felt happiness begin to break out once more.</p>",
  "<p>Gawker's dump of 950 pages of documents detailing aspects of Mitt Romney's investments shout out one big truth: that Mitt Romney is not just super-wealthy, but that his wealth is nurtured through a thicket of financial instruments that surpass ordinary expectations of wealth.</p> <p>He also makes money from British shit. But we'll come to that in a minute.</p> <p><a href=\" http://gawker.com/5933641\">The latest Gawker cache</a> is just the tip of an accounting iceberg, since it details investments that may account for only a mere $10m of Romney's estimated $250m in assets, and described just 21 of the hedge funds, vehicles and partnerships that Romney uses. There are doubtless many more.</p> <p>Once again, the spotlight turns back onto Romney's association with Bain Capital, since each of the 21 institutions detailed by Gawker are affiliated with Bain. And once again Mitt Romney's taxes become an issue, since many of these are located in the Cayman Islands, a place associated for good or ill with tax avoidance.</p> <p>Not that anyone is suggesting Mitt Romney has done anything wrong. As the Republican candidate himself repeatedly says: \"I paid the taxes required under the law.\" It's just that the vast majority of Americans don't get the opportunity to invest in Cayman Islands-domiciled funds, whatever the law may say.</p> <p>There's a lot to get through in these documents, and who can say what might be revealed? And yet, as is the style of American journalists, a few US writers have taken to emitting theatrical yawns, most spectacularly a <a href=\"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/23/gawkers-worthless-bain-files-2\">reporter for a magazine called Fortune named Dan Primack</a>, who declared: \"There is nothing in there that will inform your opinion of Mitt Romney. How do I know? Because I saw many of the exact same documents months ago, after requesting them from a Bain Capital investor. What I quickly learned [was] that there was little of interest\u2026\"</p> <p>Beauty and news being in the eye of the beholder, we can judge for ourselves, and in fact Primack \u2013 a contender for some sort of \"reverse Pulitzer\" for non-investigative journalism \u2013 is flat wrong. There are at least a few things that may indeed \"inform\" opinions of Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Take, for example, Prospect Harbor Credit Partners, described as \"a $2.8bn Delaware-based fund investing in a wide variety of American, Dutch, English and German firms\", in which Romney had investments of at least $1.25m, or the Bain Capital Europe Fund III, a $287m fund denominated in euros that invested primarily in Europe. Mitt Romney the presidential candidate is fond of berating Europe for its weak economy, and there are a couple of reasons why he might feel so strongly.</p> <p>It's almost as if Romney needs to make a financial disclaimer for every policy position he takes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://gawker.com/5933788\">In the case of Bain Capital Europe Fund III</a>, its entire capital was in two further holding companies, both based in Luxembourg, one named Ideal Standard International Topco and the other named Gemma Europe. The only outcome of note here is a \"management fee\" of \u20ac65m in 2009 paid to Bain Capital's partners. Nothing earth-shattering there, but an example of the twisting, impenetrable (for ordinary mortals) sort of places that Mitt Romney's money ends up, with Cayman Islands-based holding companies owning Luxembourg-based holding companies that pass money between themselves.</p> <p>Well, that's not quite true. You'd never know it from reading the financial statements of Bain Capital Europe Fund III, but Ideal Standard International Topco is the 100% owner of manufacturer Ideal Standards International, which also owns Armitage Shanks \u2013 a familiar name to anyone who has used a toilet in Britain.</p> <p>Yes, that's right: Mitt Romney profits from British shit. But as they say in Britain, where there's muck, there's brass. Ideal Standard passes on its profits from toilet sales to Ideal Standard International Topco, which passes them on to Bain Capital Europe Fund III in Cayman Islands, which sends them on to the investors and Bain Capital partners past and present, such as Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Now all this may indeed merit a big yawn in Wall Street and the City of London, but Mitt Romney isn't applying to lead a hedge fund called US Capital Fund I. He's running to be president of the United States and voters may be more interested in the grubby details than the masters of the universe.</p>",
  "<p>The subject was raised at the Premier League managers' meeting earlier in the month. Why does the summer transfer window overlap so destructively with the start of the season? Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas said that his solution would be for \"the market to close on the beginning of the first day of the season\". As he experiences his first window as the Tottenham Hotspur manager, it was easy to detect the yearning behind the suggestion.</p> <p>Tottenham play West Bromwich Albion at White Hart Lane on Saturday,in what will be Villas-Boas' home debut. He is looking forward to the Lane's \"very emotional and intense atmosphere\" and, hopefully, the collection of his first points at the club, after Saturday's defeat at Newcastle United.</p> <p>But nobody at his pre-match press conference was too fussed about that. How can they be when everyone, not least the club's supporters, are obsessed with his moves to complete his squad before the end of the month and the related gossip.</p> <p>No club plays the market like Tottenham, as Villas-Boas is now all too aware. They are the undisputed kings of linkage and for very good reason. They cast their net far and wide, contemplate, haggle, cast it again and, as the deadline approaches, sign off the deals that work the best for them.</p> <p>If it is nerve-wracking simply to follow, what stress levels for the manager, whose season, in some respects, has come to rest on the August business? It was unsurprising but nevertheless faintly ominous to hear one Tottenham director say that the club would be \"very busy\" next week.</p> <p>Villas-Boas went to Newcastle with one established striker and it felt as though a manager who is so thorough with his preparations had been compromised. But Villas-Boas remains firmly on message. Whenever he is asked, he insists that the increasingly frantic activity in the background has not been a distraction.</p> <p>In fact, he is playing the game like an old fox. He did not put a foot wrong at a press conference that was dominated by transfer talk and his media officer's determination to bring a swift conclusion to affairs. If only the chairman, Daniel Levy, was of similar mind.</p> <p>And so to the highlights. The Tottenham manager said that he wanted the attacking midfielder Willian from Shakhtar Donetsk. He no longer wanted the striker Leandro Dami\u00e2o from Internacional and, consequently, he was happy to enter September with Emmanuel Adebayor, Jermain Defoe and Harry Kane as his three strikers. Rafael van der Vaart was not for sale, despite the strong suggestion in Holland that he was primed to return to Hamburg.</p> <p>Luka Modric (yawn) continues to train away from the first-team group and will do so until his proposed move to Real Madrid is resolved; Michael Dawson has not reached agreement on a personal level with Queens Park Rangers, after Tottenham accepted a \u00a39m bid and he trained at Spurs Lodge on Thursday; Tom Huddlestone will only be allowed to join Stoke City on loan as Villas-Boas could yet seek to play him when he regains full match fitness.</p> <p>Youn\u00e8s Kaboul has seen a specialist about a knee injury and he will not play against West Brom, although Villas-Boas said that the problem was not serious, while Giovani dos Santos pulled a muscle in training which, so late in the window, is a cruel cut for Levy. Adebayor, who finally re-signed on Tuesday, is unlikely to start against West Brom.</p> <p>The devil in the transfer updates, though, lay in the caveats, the deeper readings, the extra details. Tottenham have had a representative in Porto Alegre this week to investigate the closure of a deal for Dami\u00e2o and Villas-Boas confirmed that the Brazil No9 was \"a fantastic player that I know of\". He added that Dami\u00e2o was \"not our prospect at the moment\". Never say never.</p> <p>The tact was similar on Van der Vaart. \"He's a player who at the moment is not for sale,\" Villas-Boas said. \"In football you never know, anything can happen, but he's a player we are counting on.\" Willian also plays as a No10 or off the flank.</p> <p>Defoe's future has been uncertain, in light of Tottenham's summer-long interest in Dami\u00e2o, and Villas-Boas admitted last week that he had had talks with Defoe and the striker's agent. He said on Thursday that he had held more talks with Defoe's agent \"two days ago\". Why the discussions if Defoe is so settled?</p> <p>It is clear that Villas-Boas would be unwise to say that a player, such as Van der Vaart, for example, is for sale as it could reduce his value and, also, lead to problems if he did not leave. On Dawson, Villas-Boas said that he would be happy if he stayed to give him five centre-halves, even if that would not be ideal for the player.</p> <p>Modric continues to cast a shadow. Madrid are prepared to offer Esteban Granero in part-exchange but he is reluctant to leave and the impasse persists. The clarity on 1 September will be a thing of beauty.</p>",
  "<p>Warwickshire's passage to a first County Championship title for eight years suffered a setback as Middlesex finished day three on 351 for five, a lead of 305.</p> <p>With second-placed Sussex holding the upper hand at Taunton, rain forecast to arrive on Friday, and Middlesex's captain Chris Rogers aware of the fast-scoring conditions and therefore disinclined to dangle too much of a declaration carrot, a draw remains the most likely result.</p> <p>They would have begun the day with aspirations of forcing a positive result and, having been dismissed for 333, a lead of 46, looked on course as Chris Wright induced edges from Robson and Denly to leave Middlesex on 25 for two. However, any hopes of turning this slight advantage into a decisive one were snuffed out by a trouble-free partnership of 203 between Rogers and Dawid Malan, both of whom recorded hundreds as the home attack toiled on a true Edgbaston surface.</p> <p>Rogers was first to three figures, reached from 143 balls with 14 fours and an uppercut six that just evaded Barker at third man, the nearest he came to being dismissed as a wicketless afternoon session brought 155 runs from 36 overs.</p> <p>Malan confirmed his promise with an elegant innings that was punishing through the offside. He closed on a chanceless 138 not out, a season's best score compiled from 204 balls with 16 fours.</p> <p>That Middlesex did not finish in an even more dominant position was entirely down to Warwickshire's tall paceman, Boyd Rankin. He hit the pitch hard in the final session and produced comfortably the most incisive spell of the innings, including a burst of three for four in 27 balls.</p> <p>First he dismissed Rogers courtesy of a sharp catch at slip from Chopra, then first-innings centurion Dexter steered to Porterfield's safe hands in gully.</p> <p>Rossington spliced a poorly conceived and executed hook shot and Rankin might have had a fourth wicket when Gareth Berg was put down on 18 by Clarke. Instead, he went to a half-century from 62 balls as Middlesex took control.</p>",
  "<p>There is no evidence British Paralympians are involved in the banned practice of artificially \"boosting\" blood pressure to improve performance, officials said following claims that up to 30% of those athletes with spinal damage may be doing it.</p> <p>A BBC World Service documentary, Cheating at the Paralympics, that aired on Thursday night, suggested the practice \u2013 banned by the International Paralympic Committee since 1994 \u2013 remains widespread.</p> <p>So-called \"boosting\" involves the deliberate induction of a dangerous condition common to quadriplegics called autonomic dysreflexia, which boosts blood pressure and the heart rate.</p> <p>The condition can be triggered naturally by injury or even sunburn, but can also be induced artificially and can improve performance by up to 10%.</p> <p>According to the documentary, common pain stimuli used to induce the condition include deliberately breaking small bones, sitting on a pin, using tight leg straps, overfilling the bladder by clamping a catheter or twisting the scrotum.</p> <p>The IPC said those events in which competitors could benefit from boosting \u2013 the T52 wheelchair races and hand cycling races in which athletes with high spinal cord injuries participate \u2013 were carefully monitored.</p> <p>In Beijing, it said, 37 blood pressure tests were carried out and no evidence of boosting was found.</p> <p>If an athlete's blood pressure was found to be too high they could be barred from competition on medical grounds, but it was not appropriate to sanction them further because the condition could be naturally occurring.</p> <p>ParalympicsGB chef de mission Craig Hunter said all its 287 athletes, around 60 of whom have now moved into the Paralympic Village, had been through an education programme that included the dangers of boosting.</p> <p>\"We have an educational programme with our athletes, which goes across all aspects of their preparation. Our athletes are fully aware that we do not encourage boosting in any way, shape or form and of the potential impact of being caught boosting,\" said Hunter.</p> <p>\"We know there will be monitoring going on during the Games, that's very much in the hands of the IPC. The athletes are very aware and we are not aware of any issues on our team.\"</p> <p>An IPC spokesman pointed out that Brad Zdanivsky, a 36-year-old Canadian interviewed by the programme, was a mountain climber and not a Paralympian.</p> <p>The BBC also spoke to Dr Andrei Krassioukov, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia and an experienced researcher into spinal injuries, who claimed up to 30% of athletes could be boosting in a bid to replicate the effect of exercise in non-paraplegic athletes.</p> <p>But the IPC spokesman said that while it was taken seriously, it was important not to overstate the prevalence of boosting.</p> <p>Hunter said the overall mood in the ParalympicsGB camp was \"one of extreme anticipation and excitement\".</p> <p>The archery, football and shooting teams have already moved into the Paralympic Village. The full complement of 287 athletes, plus 13 guides and pilots, and 300 support staff will be in place by the Opening Ceremony on Wednesday.\"</p> <p>As each athlete moved into the Village, Hunter said that they had been shown a montage of highlights from the Olympics.</p> <p>'We have just come off the back of the most amazing Olympic Games and that has inspired our team. The ability to use those inspirational moments to help them has been quite key,\" said Hunter, who praised the facilities in the Village as \"spectacular\".</p> <p>The apartments were designed to transition as seamlessly as possible between the Olympics and the Paralympics, although Hunter said the incoming athletes had brought with them secret weapons in the form of matress toppers and extra pillows to guarantee a good night's sleep.</p> <p>Between a third and half of the British Paralympians are expected to take part in Wednesday's opening ceremony, with those who are competing shortly afterwards or would find it detrimental to their performance declining to do so.</p> <p>ParalympicsGB had been \"concerned\" at initial plans under which athletes were to have made their own way to the stadium for the opening ceremony, so transport has now been provided.</p> <p>Hunter said the target of second place in the medal table, with at least 103 medals across at least 12 sports, was \"challenging but achievable\".</p> <p>\"Team GB did us proud and ParalympicsGB want to equally do us proud.</p> <p>One of the challenges around Paralympic sport is that the competition programme is not as sophisticated yet. It's more challenging [to predict]. The levels of interest and investment are emerging in other nations,\" he said.</p> <p>Locog said that 100,000 Olympic Park tickets put on sale on Wednesday had sold out within 24 hours, taking the total number of Paralympic tickets sold to a record 2.4m. A final 200,000 are expected to come onto the market as venue configurations are finalised. The London Games is expected to be the first to sell out.</p>",
  "<p>Two years after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/27/bach-sonatas-partitas-review\" title=\"\">her disc of the D minor and E major Partitas and the C major Sonata</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artsmg.com/Strings/IsabelleFaust/index.html\" title=\"\">Isabelle Faust</a> completes her set of Bach's works for solo violin with G minor and A minor Sonatas and the B&#xa0;minor Partita. As you would expect from this most immaculate and intelligent of today's violinists, the performances are very well prepared. In a&#xa0;sleeve note, Faust describes the works as presenting \"an enormous mass of questions which seems to grow bigger with every attempt to answer them\", so that any interpretation is, at best, a \"snapshot\" of a continuing process. Yet there is still a wonderful security and confidence about her approach, a flexibility in her phrasing, and a remarkable control of dynamic and colour. At times, the faster movements could be a bit more unbuttoned, a little less detached, but the quality of Faust's playing is never in doubt.</p>",
  "<p>Fleet Street's refusal to publish pictures of a naked Prince Harry represents a remarkable moment of collective restraint with a royal who has already benefited from a different sort of press blackout. Four years ago, the media agreed not to report on his tour of duty to Afghanistan until Australian magazine New Idea broke the embargo, although it did not get much attention until it was picked up by the US-based Drudge report weeks later.</p> <p>This time, though, Harry has been the beneficiary of a heavy handed and controversial intervention from the Press Complaints Commission \u2013 at the behest of Clarence House \u2013 after another US publication, TMZ.com, published two pictures of him naked on its website on Wednesday. Veteran tabloid journalists say that the existence of the Leveson inquiry has forced redtops to be even more cautious.</p> <p>PCC advisory notices are not meant to be made public, but it is an open secret that on Wednesday afternoon, as it emerged that the picture agency Splash Pictures was making the Harry photos available for sale, the body was telling editors what to do.</p> <p>Because the pictures of Harry were taken in his hotel room it was suggested that the prince had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and that anybody choosing to publish would therefore be in breach of the code.</p> <p>Yet, it was a surprising decision for a body that has, in other cases, taken a different view. Two years ago, the PCC ruled that Alix Bromley had lost control over her own image because photographs of the young woman, posing fully clothed on a social networking site, had circulated widely online.</p> <p>At that time, the PCC held that Loaded magazine was within its rights to offer readers \u00a3500 if they could get her along to a photoshoot because she had the \"best breasts on the block\".</p> <p>However, the protection denied the young woman was extended rapidly to Prince Harry, even though, as in Bromley's case, the cork was out of the bottle.</p> <p>The result is that the PCC \u2013 itself under pressure to show that it can be a tough regulator in the aftermath of the phone hacking crisis \u2013 has asked Fleet Street not to re-publish pictures that are likely to have been viewed already millions of times online. In so doing, the regulator has created a situation where, mirroring the privacy injunction crisis, information circulating online doesn't appear in the nation's popular press.</p> <p>Then there was the case of footballers allegedly involved in affairs whose names were freely circulating on Twitter because they had taken out injunctions to stop themselves being named.</p> <p>Neil Wallis, a former deputy editor of the News of the World, who has been arrested by police on suspicion of involvement in phone hacking, wrote on the Huffington Post blog that tabloid editors and executives were \"terrified of risking the opprobrium of Leveson's law, of losing their jobs, or their newspapers losing advertising revenue\".</p> <p>With the judge writing up the conclusions into his press inquiry it is &#xa0;easy to understand why it is tempting to err on the side of caution \u2013 although there are other factors worth taking into consideration, not least whether British readers would believe it tasteful to see &#xa0;in print pictures of a still popular royal unclothed.</p> <p>Irish newspapers took a completely different view, with the Irish Daily Star \u2013 half owned by Richard Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell \u2013 and Dublin's Evening Herald publishing images of the royal prince on their front pages. \"Flash Harry,\" said the Star. The upmarket Irish Independent published the images on page three; this is a title that also circulates in the UK, and therefore sidesteps the PCC ban. Ironically, Ireland has what could be described as stronger press regulation than the UK, because the Press Council of Ireland is recognised in law \u2013 a model being actively considered by Lord Justice Leveson as a way of toughening up the system.</p> <p>But, of course, the reason Dublin-titles have chosen to publish is simple: Buckingham palace exerts no influence over the Irish sea. Nevertheless, in Britain, a curious cocktail of circumstance has emerged, in which a combination of traditional deference to the palace, a PCC desperate to show it can be tough to the point where it forgets its own case law, and fears about provoking a judge who is writing a once-in-a-generation report, have kept pictures of a royal prince's high jinks off the front pages.</p> <p>The outcome, though, is to create a gulf between what British papers can publish and what can be read online \u2013 a disparity that so worries tabloid editors.</p> <p>Except, there is little readers missed. All could read that the prince, third in line to the throne, could invite a lot of strangers to his room in the early hours, take his clothes off and let himself be photographed naked. To complete one's knowledge all anybody had to do was go to Google. Is that media in competition or media acting in harmony?</p>",
  "<p>My thanks to <a href=\"http://www.bpp.com/about-bpp/aboutBPP/carl-lygo\" title=\"\">Carl Lygo</a> for the name-check (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/20/london-metropolitan-university-outsourcing-services?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Outsourcing services allows academics to concentrate on what they do best</a>, Education, 20 August). However, he identifies me as a distinguished academic in fine art. I am rather, an art historian, with a career-long commitment to leadership and management in higher education and, as such, I have serious concerns about the challenges we face.</p> <p>My own institution's response has been to radically focus our management and reduce the number of courses we offer so we can improve both the student and staff experience. Fewer courses accounts for about 14% of the reduction in student applications to UCA. This leaves UCA with a 16% total reduction in applications this year in real terms, the national average for art and design courses. This is a worrying figure for all of us committed to creative arts education and its overwhelmingly positive impact on the&#xa0;UK economy. The situation will require a carefully calibrated response, particularly from specialist institutions like UCA, which have little opportunity of cross-subsidising courses.</p> <p>I doubt outsourcing will be the answer. It appears as though everyone wants to provide, rather than buy services, and there has been too little consideration of some of the disastrous and costly unintended consequences of outsourcing in other public services \u2013 the cleaning of hospitals being one example. Many of the functions Lygo suggests are extraneous to the core business of the university are actually critical in terms of ensuring the staff and student experience. In my opinion, the cost of monitoring outsourced services is grossly underestimated and what looks now like a potential gain in terms of savings and focus could be quite the opposite.<br><a href=\"http://ucreative.ac.uk/governor-simon-ofield-kerr\" title=\"\"><strong>Dr Simon Ofield-Kerr</strong></a><br><em>Vice-chancellor, University for the Creative Arts</em></p>",
  "<p>\"I've always had the tendency to cause trouble,\" says Maryam Keshavarz. The 36-year-old is speaking down the line from an idyllic-sounding writers' retreat in Portugal, but with the release of Circumstance in the UK this week, the first-time director is not far from controversy.</p> <p>Set in Iran, the film follows two girls: Atafeh, raised in a rich liberal home, and Shireen, an orphan whose conservative uncle cannot afford to pay for her schooling. Against a backdrop of hedonistic underground parties, the teenagers' intense friendship spills over into a passionate love affair. With <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/17/iran-persecution-gay-community-revealed\" title=\"\">homosexuality illegal</a> in Iran (punishable by lashings or even death) their happiness is threatened by the jealousy of Atafeh's brother, an ex-drug addict who finds religion and with it the ear of the powerful morality police.</p> <p>Replete with illicit sex, drugs and alcohol, and furious in its criticism of the Islamic Republic, the movie's forthright style has made Keshavarz a target of death threats, she says. On the phone from Lisbon she sounds nonchalant, saying that \"in the beginning I was more frightened\", but insisting there have been so many, they no longer have the power to terrorise her. Yet she is cautious enough to refuse to reveal much.</p> <p>The film has also aroused passionate feelings in audiences at screenings, leading to arguments and walkouts. \"There were screaming matches,\" she laughs. \"One woman said: 'This film is such bullshit \u2013 it doesn't look like Iran, smell like Iran, taste like Iran.' I didn't even have a chance to reply when this woman in her 20s stood up and shouted at the older woman: 'I just came from Iran and it's people like you who are ruining our country because you deny the reality.'\" But her taboo-busting has also won critical acclaim (and the audience award at the Sundance film festival) while fans, many of whom are young women, have sent scores of \"long, emotional, emails\".</p> <p>Which is why, despite knowing that the focus on sexuality meant it was unlikely she would be able to travel to Iran again \u2013 \"You can always go to Iran,\" she tells me sardonically, \"you can't necessarily leave\" \u2013 Keshavarz, who is bisexual, was determined to show the physical interactions of the lovers.</p> <p>\"As a young girl growing up, I had not seen much on film I could identify with \u2013 not just sexual orientation but&#xa0;sexuality.</p> <p>\"They [Atafeh and Shireen] are brave individuals \u2013 they don't stop, they have an emotion and attraction and even though it could get them into trouble they still do it.\"</p> <p>Critics of the film have questioned its authenticity, and whether Keshavarz has the right to tell stories about Iran at all, given she does not live in the country. She was born and brought up in the US, where her parents have lived since the 1960s. But, she says, she has spent much of her life shuttling between the countries \u2013 spending summer holidays, a year of school, and time as a visiting scholar at the University of Shiraz in Iran. That has not always been easy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395103792\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345732520873/Maryam-Keshavarz-001.jpg\" alt=\"Maryam Keshavarz\" width=\"210\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maryam Keshavarz, director of Circumstance. Photograph: Peccadillo Films</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peccadillo Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"It was difficult on both ends to be from two countries that hated each other,\" she admits. \"In Iran it was all 'death to America' and 'you are American, you are a spy!'\"</p> <p>After students stormed the US embassy in Tehran in the 1970s, and took staff hostage, the family's US neighbours violently rejected them.</p> <p>\"Before Iran was this exotic place, but after the hostage-taking we were the enemy. My brothers were beaten up, they threw things at our windows and slashed our tyres,\" she recalls. \"They harassed us constantly. We were&#xa0;ostracised \u2013 it was a very, very difficult time.\"</p> <p>While some of her brothers (she has seven) responded by hiding their ethnicity, the experience sparked Keshavarz's lifelong attempt to \"translate\" the two countries to each other. Many of the film's characters were based on relatives or people she met during her time in Iran. The parties Atafeh and Shireen attend reflect her nights out with her cousins \u2013 ironically the only time she could do as she pleased as a teenager.</p> <p>\"I grew up in an ultra-religious family. I wasn't allowed to date boys or go out after a certain time. When I made the varsity basketball team as a freshman \u2013 which was a big honour \u2013 you had to wear shorts, so my dad said: 'You can't play.' Of course I did what I wanted, but I constantly had these huge battles with him. Luckily I had really liberal-minded brothers who helped me a lot.</p> <p>\"My father always had a tight hold on my social life \u2013 he was afraid I would be corrupted, but Iran is supposed to be an Islamic state so they thought 'what trouble could she get into?' The craziest parties I have been to and the wildest things I have done were definitely in Iran.\"</p> <p>Circumstance, she says, reflects issues in both cultures \u2013 and, while set in Iran and scripted in Farsi, its glossiness and pace feel American. The theme of surveillance \u2013 which culminates in Atafeh's brother secretly filming the lovers \u2013 addresses anxieties around officially sanctioned snooping in the US during the Bush era. But it also illustrates how the state can permeate and sour family life; she first saw this, aged seven, when she spent a year in school in Iran at the height of the Iran-Iraq war.</p> <p>\"Questioning children was very prevalent at the time,\" she tells me. \"They would ask 'do your parents pray?' or 'do you watch foreign movies?'</p> <p>\"I was from the school system in America, where you are taught to always tell the truth no matter what. But [in Iran] you knew you could get your family in trouble so you learned to lie.</p> <p>\"I was very much aware that I had to be careful what I said \u2013 and it creates a schism in children, I think. I had cousins who were my age and some of them were,\" she drops her voice and whispers, mock-dramatically, \"<em>the spies</em> for the teachers.\"</p> <p>Circumstance's strength is in the exuberance of Atafeh and Shireen, filled with adolescent fantasies of escape (and cringeworthy lad's mag-style fantasies of each other: all matching underwear and high heels) and their rebellious rush to dance, drink and break rules. At times the sensuous hair-flicking and the way the camera lingers on their beauty feels overdone and their interest in liberalism seems to extend only to their right to party.</p> <p>But the film frames their insistence on following their desires, whatever the consequences, as a powerful form of dissent; Atafeh tells a friend: \"Here&#xa0;anything illegal becomes politically subversive.\"</p> <p>Set immediately before the protests of the Green movement swept through Iran, the film aims to show where the anger behind the demonstrations came from. \"In Iran where the state controls your behaviour \u2026 they want you to dress a certain way, and not speak to people of the opposite sex in the street \u2013 of course the personal is political,\" explains Keshavarz, \"in a more explicit way than anywhere else.\"</p> <p>And while the film's religious figures may be hypocrites and villains, Keshavarz is uncomfortable with anyone reading the film as anti-religion. Rather, she says, it is about how power and politics corrupt religion.</p> <p>\"It is happening in the US too, with the intrusion of the church into politics. It's a global problem. Look at the focus on birth control in America. It's 2012, and we are talking about the pill \u2013 are we joking?\"</p> <p>Crucially, she says, it is her religious parents, who refused to impose their beliefs on her, and insisted she think for herself, who gave her the strength to make a film her mother disapproves of. \"I think my parents taught me to be a fighter \u2013 I just don't think they intended it to come out the way it did.\"</p> <p>Circumstance is released in the UK on 24 August</p>",
  "<p>Where the path begins to emerge from the green tunnel formed by the overarching branches, sunlight breaks through the thinning canopy to fall in bright splashes upon the ground. Lying in the shadows next to one of these patches is a bunch of bright red berries, and I realise that so intent have I been on the plants growing by the pathside I have barely raised my eyes from ground level and have almost walked past the rowan. It is a lovely tree, grown tall in this sheltered location and each spring it is bedecked with sharp-scented blossom. Looking up, I find to my delight it is now heavy with berries, and crowned with a vision of such simple beauty it makes me gasp aloud. A single slender branch, taller than all the rest, reaches up into sky and at its end a spray of the rowan's elegant leaves and a clutch of scarlet berries are lit by the morning sun to glow with jewel-like brightness against a backdrop of flawless blue.</p> <p>Standing spellbound, gazing upward in stillness, I slowly become aware of the sounds I can hear around me. Above my head a gentle breeze moves through the trees, setting them to whisper together, sound and movement rising to a soft crescendo and then fading as the breeze moves on, and from among the tangle of branches comes the soft two-note call of a hidden willow warbler. In the shade beneath the trees, flies are busy, the quiet background drone of their flight punctuated occasionally by the sharper sound of an insect passing closer by. More mellow by far is the summer sound of bees working among the flowers on the sunlit slopes beyond the trees. And&#xa0;still I cannot take my eyes from the rowan. Along this popular footpath I seem to have stumbled on a tiny private world, and am torn between the desire to stay longer and the need to leave before the spell is broken by the sound of human voices.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi, Justin, where are you?</strong></p> <p>I am eating vegetarian food in a Japanese restaurant in London. Five days a week, I only eat vegan, and mostly vegetables. I do eat meat or fish if it's been spectacularly prepared, and has died in an accident.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Nice. You're looking good in your new press photos. Have you lost weight?</strong></p> <p>Yes, I was 15/16st. I'm just under 11st now.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>How did you lose so much?</strong></p> <p>A combination of bulimia and speed. No, the key is to stop eating meat and fish, and stop drinking milk. Just drink water. Get rid of bread. Oh, and go to the gym every day.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>I see you've got a goatee and moustache.</strong></p> <p>Yes, the moustache happened in 2009, and when we started doing the Darkness again [in 2010] the rest of the guys talked me into growing a beard, which I was resistant to, but now I love.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>You're also quite heavily tattooed.</strong></p> <p>Yes, I've got one of a winged microphone, a \"mind-sword\", the TDK logo, and one of vintage mid-'80s synthesizer the DX7 \u2013 as used by Queen \u2013 that I had done in 2008.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Why did you decide to have a vintage mid-'80s synthesizer engraved on your arm?</strong></p> <p>Because I have one in my synthesizer collection at home, and they make me laugh.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Any other tattoos we should know about?</strong> I have individual images of the members of Queen, <a href=\"http://hardrockheavymetal.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/queen-hot-space-1982.jpg\" title=\"\">from the album Hot Space</a> on my fingers. I thought someone should stick up for Hot Space \u2013 the contentious, disowned Queen album \u2013 so I did. It's a really iconic piece of artwork, and Under Pressure is on the record.&#xa0;I also have \"Lowestoft\" tattooed on my stomach.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>So rappers have \"Compton\", you have Lowestoft?</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I'm on the East Side. Of England.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Do you still live in Lowestoft?</strong></p> <p>Yes, I live near where I went to school. I'm literally five minutes from my mum and dad. I go round every day. I take my dogs there and hang out.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Do you take your washing?</strong></p> <p>No, I enjoy doing laundry. It's part of the grounding process.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>What's it like there?</strong></p> <p>I rent a house next to a nature reserve and a football pitch, and a beach \u2013 a wild one, where people go to do dogging. There's a lot of sex that happens in the bushes. I see men standing in them, fully erect. Happens all the time. It used to be a nudist area. Great place to walk the dogs, although it's not ideal if you don't want to see men's cocks.</p> <p><strong>You imagine it's the least&#xa0;likely people who&#xa0;go dogging.</strong></p> <p>I know. You expect people like me to do it, but you'd never catch me dogging.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Never?</strong></p> <p>No. Contrary to popular expectation.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>You're single, aren't you? <a href=\"#1\">(1</a><a name=\"1back\">)</a> What's it like?</strong></p> <p>You miss your pets when you're away from them. When you're away on tour and you've got a girlfriend, there's always the check-in phone call: before the gig, after the gig, whatever. I didn't think I'd miss that \u2013 it was one of the things that annoyed me about having a relationship \u2013 but actually now it's gone, I sort of do. And I can't ring my dog. He's no good at Skype. And FaceTime's out of the question.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Much has been made of your period of bacchanalian excess. For example, you once made a male lackey feed you spaghetti bolognese in a lift. Hardly Caligula, though, is it?</strong></p> <p>Ah, but you don't know how he came to be in a lift with me...</p> <p><strong>There has been a lot of alcoholic and narcotic excess in the Darkness' history, but not much of the sexual variety \u2026</strong></p> <p>When you're in a relationship with the manager of the band, it's quite difficult to, you know ... These days, I'm too focused for that: I get up, have porridge and water and really strong black coffee for breakfast, then I run 6km, then I do my weights, then it's time to warm up my voice because I get up late, and then two hours before the show I put my makeup on and do my stretches. Then there's the show. Winding down for me doesn't involve fucking \u2013 I wouldn't be able to do my morning thing the next day.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>You're one of the few metal bands that women like.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Yeah. I think we're all a bit effeminate. We're not men's men, much as we may appear to be so.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Are you, to paraphrase Suede's Brett Anderson, a heterosexual who's never had a homosexual experience? <a href=\"#2\">(2</a><a name=\"2back\">)</a></strong></p> <p>My sexual persuasion is nobody's business but my own \u2013 but I'm easily persuaded. Just kidding. Is that a genuine question about my sexuality?</p> <p><strong>Er ... </strong></p> <p>I want to go back to that sexuality thing. You reckon I'm gay, don't you?</p> <p><strong>Er, are you gay?</strong></p> <p>None of your business! It's funny because it came up recently&#xa0;in&#xa0;a&#xa0;German interview. They reckoned that when you Google Justin Hawkins, one of the first things that comes up is: \"Is&#xa0;Justin Hawkins gay?\" And I'd like to think that's because there's&#xa0;something I do that connects with&#xa0;a gay audience. Maybe it's all the cocks I suck? </p> <p><strong>Talking of sex, in the video to your latest single </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkmno7nNWTg\" title=\"\"><strong>Everybody Have a Good Time</strong></a><strong>, you get intimate with a bear.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>It was going to be a monkey, but animatronic monkey faces were too terrifying. So we came up with the bear. Unfortunately, the record company said it would be too expensive to have an animatronic one , so it had to be a guy in a bear costume. With a bra on.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Have you ever had amorous feelings towards an animal?</strong></p> <p>Well, when you're in a field in the fresh air, you can become amorous, and there might happen to be animals present. But it's more to do with the climate, and the rustling of leaves. That gets me going.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>There's a Radiohead cover <a href=\"#3\">(3</a><a name=\"3back\">)</a> on your new album. Was that to prick their pomposity?</strong></p> <p>No. It was to inflate ours. People used to say we must hate Radiohead, but we don't, we love them. I don't know anyone who doesn't love Radiohead. This was our chance to show our respect.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Who is the foremost pompous, preening&#xa0;ninny in pop?</strong></p> <p>Well, it used to be me. I thought pop was all about pompous, preening ninnies.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Look at Jagger.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Exactly. That guy from Maroon 5 doesn't have moves like Jagger. He's maybe got moves like Jagger's waxwork at Madame Tussaud's. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>You sing on your track, Every Inch Of You, \"I wanted to be a doctor or a vet until I heard Communication Breakdown.\" True?</strong></p> <p>When I was a kid I wanted to be either a helicopter pilot, or a doctor or a vet. And I'm sure mum would have loved any of those. Maybe not helicopter pilot. Dad would have liked that.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Are they disappointed in your choice of career?</strong></p> <p>Not at all. They're delighted. Over the moon. My father's a builder and he's worked all his life and he just wanted me and Dan [Hawkins, his guitarist brother] to not have to.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Can you afford to not work any more?</strong></p> <p>No, I have to work. Spiritually as well as financially.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>It was once alleged that you personally blew \u00a3150,000 on cocaine ...</strong></p> <p>That's a massive exaggeration. It was actually \u00a3149,000.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Was it you who spent it, or the whole band?</strong></p> <p>No, just me.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>You said you wanted to write the world's simplest, dumbest rock song with Everybody Have a Good Time.

Or somebody very brave. Or an idiot.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Did you really once write jingles for Ikea?</strong></p> <p>I did, yes. That's how we paid for the first album. It was TV adverts. I did HSBC, Tango, Mars bars, Irn Bru, the Sunday Express gardening supplement TV ad \u2013 I've been running a jingle company for the last 15 years.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>You're about to tour with </strong><a href=\"http://www.theactualdarkness.com/2012/04/lady-gaga-the-darkness-europe-2012/\" title=\"\"><strong>Lady Gaga</strong></a><strong>. Do you get nervous with stars in a higher commercial league than you?</strong></p> <p>I'm in awe of Lady Gaga. I love the mystique around her, and the way she's this entity all the time. You never see her without full make-up, or pictures of her going to the supermarket wearing something baggy. She's 100% an artist; a work of art. That's what I aspire to be. She's a hero. So it's going to be weird meeting her. But it's got nothing to do with earnings.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>What is the ratio of piss-take to authentic in what you do? 90/10?&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>There's no piss-take. All of it is affection. My mum would often recount hilarious tales of hanging around with Jimi Hendrix and Brian Jones. She wasn't a groupie, I'd like to stress. But she was around in the 60s and in that scene and she loved and knew all those people. I say \"knew\" \u2013 not in that sense. But she ran in the same circles. Anyway, her and my aunty had a lot of famous friends. And they talked about Brian Jones turning up at a club in a pink catsuit, and the way Hendrix used to dress. All we're doing is affectionately doing music the way it should be done, and wearing the correct uniform.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>You worked with Queen's producer Roy Thomas Baker on your second album. What did he make of you?</strong></p> <p>He often compared me to the obvious, and that was lovely.</p> <p><strong>As singer and guitarist, you're Freddie (Mercury) and Brian (May) in one, aren't you?</strong></p> <p>I always wanted to be Freddie, Brian, Angus (Young) and Bon (Scott) in one. Those are my four touchstones.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>There's a track on your new album called Nothing's Gonna Stop Us. What could conceivably stop you?</strong></p> <p>Death.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Will your album, Hot Cakes, sell like hot&#xa0;cakes?</strong></p> <p>I couldn't care less.

  "<p>Earlier this year, Killer Mike made quite a splash with his latest album, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.A.P._Music\" title=\"\">R.A.P. Music</a>. Critics couldn't help but marvel at the unlikely pairing of Mike, with his distinctly southern credentials (and drawl to match), and New York producer EL-P, an underground figure known for his aggressive, frenetic sound. But it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPyjJ1MMUzQ\" title=\"\">one track in particular, Reagan</a>, that really raised eyebrows. Although Mike's ostensible target in the song is former Republican President Ronald Reagan (Mike's not a huge fan \u2013 his final line is \"I'm glad Reagan dead\") he also takes some unexpected shots at Barack Obama, at one point characterising him as \"just another talking head telling lies&#xa0;on teleprompters\". Elsewhere, he&#xa0;compares Obama's military policies to Reagan's.</p> <p>We might be surprised to hear this kind of criticism of the man who, just a few years earlier, was declared \"America's first hip-hop president\" because of his deep ties to the genre. Was Killer Mike really attacking the man once dubbed \"B-Rock\" by <a href=\"http://www.vibe.com/\" title=\"\">Vibe magazine</a>? The real surprise, however, is that the track Reagan is not an isolated rebuke but merely the most recent illustration of the deteriorating relationship between Obama and hip-hop. Killer Mike is just one voice in a growing chorus of dissent from within the rap world by artists who believe Obama has failed to take up the pressing issues facing black people in the US.</p> <p>\"Quite obviously, black America is in terrible crisis,\" says Tricia Rose, professor of Africana studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. \"The racial and class dimensions of this crisis have simply been largely sidestepped by the Obama presidency and muted by black leadership, which seems largely frozen by the effect of not wanting to undermine the first black president.\"</p> <p>The waning of the Obama/hip-hop love affair appears to be a two-way street, with Obama showing far less interest in the genre than he did in 2008. In fact, the distinction between his two presidential campaigns is stark.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JPyjJ1MMUzQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JPyjJ1MMUzQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Rewind to the first election. In the early stages of his campaign, then-senator Obama was making tentative overtures to hip-hop, noting in particular his appreciation of, and interest in, rap music. This was remarkable, in that he was flipping the script on two decades of campaign orthodoxy \u2013 followed by Democrats and Republicans alike \u2013 that hip-hop was politically radioactive. (In fact, the term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Souljah_moment\" title=\"\">\"Sister Souljah moment\"</a> \u2013 used to describe when politicians distance themselves from extreme elements within their own party \u2013 has its origins in hip-hop: in 1992, Bill Clinton publicly repudiated rapper and activist Sister Souljah for her provocative comments after the Los Angeles riots.)</p> <p>By 2008, seeing the energy his hip-hop affiliations could generate, especially with young voters, Obama was all in \u2013 encouraging artists such as Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs to campaign for him, frequently referencing rap music in his interviews and speeches, and playing rap at his events. In one of the lasting images of the campaign, Obama stood in front of an audience in Raleigh, North Carolina and, invoking <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz_-VaTHpc8\" title=\"\">Jay-Z's 2003 track Dirt Off Your Shoulder</a>, pretended to brush dirt off his own shoulder. He received standing applause from the crowd and a huge amount of news coverage afterwards. In that one motion, he had transformed the liability of his relative youth into an asset and, in the process, swept away any doubts that hip-hop would remain front and centre for the remainder of his campaign.</p> <p>Rappers were more than happy to play their part, too. As early as 2007, Obama's name started appearing in songs by socially conscious rappers such as Common and Talib Kweli, but it wasn't until the summer of 2008, when he emerged as the Democratic frontrunner, that Obama sparked a mini-industry of&#xa0;songs and mixtapes making direct reference to his candidacy. A long line of performers \u2013 including Nas, Jay-Z, Ludacris, Lil Wayne, Big Boi, Busta Rhymes, Jadakiss, will.i.am, Three 6 Mafia and Young Jeezy \u2013 drew on Obama's rhetoric of hope and change in an effort to mobilise youth and minority voters (and maybe to sell a few albums).</p> <p>It worked. In the 2008 election, youth voter turnout was the highest it&#xa0;had been in 35 years, and it helped propel Obama to the White House. Fittingly, Jay-Z and Diddy had highly coveted seats on the Capitol steps for the inauguration, while <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9sABRosdNg\" title=\"\">Young Jeezy's My President </a>could be heard playing from street corners across the nation's capital. After that, it was clear that hip-hop could be a potent mobilising force. \"Hip-hop brought awareness to a group of young adults who probably would not have voted otherwise,\" says Jermaine Hall, editor-in-chief of Vibe magazine. \"Some were educated on Obama's political points. Others were just happy to be part of electing a black president into office. Either way the role that Jay-Z, Puff [Diddy] and other hip-hop influencers played in that election can never be denied.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395141809\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/23/1345738070896/Barack-Obama-and-Ludacris-010.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Ludacris in 2006\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapper Ludacris with then Senator Obama after a meeting together in Chicago in 2006.

In 2009, the Obamas launched the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/From-the-Studio\" title=\"\">White House Music Series</a>, which has sponsored a&#xa0;variety of musical performances at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Since its inception, the series has paid tribute to&#xa0;a wide range of genres, including classical, jazz, Motown and country, but rap, the music so instrumental to Obama's success, still hasn't been formally recognised. In fairness, the president isn't entirely to blame for this. In May of 2011, the Obamas invited <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(entertainer)\" title=\"\">Common</a> to perform at a White House poetry event, but rightwing pundits \u2013 Sarah Palin and Karl Rove foremost among them \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/12/sarah-palin-common-_n_860986.html\" title=\"\">doused the event in controversy</a>, using deviously selective readings of Common's work to argue that Obama had just welcomed an anti-police \"thug\" into his midst. The&#xa0;story spread like wildfire. It didn't matter that Common is widely regarded as one of the most positive, peace-loving figures in rap.</p> <p>The Common debacle is clearly illustrative of the opposition's strategy. \"Republicans have pounced on any and all associations Obama might make with black people in a way that has the potential to turn white centrist and independent voters against him,\" says Rose. Fully aware that these voters may see Obama's rap connections as a liability, Jay-Z noted the need for caution. In a 2009 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/29/carter-jaz-z-hip-hop\" title=\"\">interview with the Guardian</a> he said: \"I didn't want the association with rappers and gangsta rappers to hinder anything that [Obama] was doing. I&#xa0;came when I was needed; I didn't make any comments in the press, go too far or put my picture with Obama on MySpace, Twitter, none of that.\"</p> <p>Deciding that potential swing voters are too important to lose in 2012, Obama appears to have capitulated, at least with respect to rap. When <a href=\"http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2012/02/09/political-playlist-obamas-2012-campaign-rally-music\" title=\"\">his campaign released its 29-song playlist</a> in February, there was not a single rap song on it. There was a healthy dose of country, though, including two songs each by Sugarland and Darius Rucker. Several months later, the campaign expanded its list, finally adding a couple of rap songs, one of which was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amXeJrA-wDc\" title=\"\">K'naan's Wavin' Flag</a>. This addition was probably less of a tribute to rap, however, than a dig at Mitt Romney. Earlier this year, the Republican challenger used Wavin' Flag in his own campaign, but was forced to stop after K'naan objected (and then invited Obama to use it instead).</p> <p>Keeping a safe distance from rap may be a wise strategic move, but putting politics before principle runs counter to the slogan of \"change\" that Obama ran on, and it has opened him up to some scathing attacks. In his February 2011 song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22l1sf5JZD0\" title=\"\">Words I Never Said,&#xa0;Lupe Fiasco raps</a>: \"Gaza Strip was&#xa0;getting bombed/ Obama didn't say shit/ That's why I ain't vote for him.\" A&#xa0;few months later, the musician intensified his <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/08/lupe-fiasco-obama-terrorist_n_873353.html\" title=\"\">criticism in a video interview with CBS</a>: \"To me, the biggest terrorist is Obama in the United States of America.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395141810\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/23/1345738194336/Lupe-Fiasco-2011-010.jpg\" alt=\"Lupe Fiasco, 2011\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lupe Fiasco has described Obama as 'the biggest terrorist'. Photograph: Matt Sayles/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Sayles/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lupe wasn't alone. In October of last year, British rapper Lowkey released <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB-vYuYhdSE\" title=\"\">Obama Nation (Part II)</a>, on which M1 of Dead Prez calls Obama \"a master of disguise, expert at telling lies\". Using less incendiary rhetoric, the Seattle-based Blue Scholars nevertheless <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbssPOsHwNs\" title=\"\">open their song Hussein</a> (Obama's middle name) with \"This ain't the hope or the change you imagined\", going on to suggest that Obama has failed to address the US's economic inequality.</p> <p>Obama is hardly the first political leader to reach power and face a backlash from artists who once supported him, but in the absence of the pro-Obama anthems we heard in 2008 or the deep-throated support of legions of performers, the voices of dissent have become especially pronounced. It doesn't help that some of Obama's major fans have changed their tune. Speech, of Arrested Development, who supported Obama in 2008, <a href=\"http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2012/02/arrested_development_rapper_speech_obama_ron_paul.php\" title=\"\">said earlier this year he was \"disillusioned\" with the president</a> and would support the Republican Ron Paul instead. Snoop Dogg, another Obama fan in 2008, also seemed to throw some of his support behind Paul when he posted a picture of the politician to his Facebook page with the caption, \"Smoke weed every day\", a reference to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/25/florida-primary-candidates-drug-policy\" title=\"\">Paul's marijuana-friendly platform</a>.</p> <p>Even those inauguration VIPs Diddy and Jay-Z have tempered their enthusiasm. In early 2011, Diddy <a href=\"http://www.thesource.com/articles/41376/Diddy-Covers-The-Source\" title=\"\">told hip-hop magazine the Source</a>, \"I love the president like most of us. I just want the president to do better.\" Jay-Z also acknowledged problems with Obama's first term, admitting that some of the criticism directed at the president has been fair. \"Numbers don't lie,\" he said last July, during a preview of Watch the Throne, his collaboration with Kanye West. \"It's fucked up out there. Unemployment is still high.\"</p> <p>When asked if he feels disappointed with Obama, rapper Nas expresses his continued support for the president but also his disillusionment with the political process that put him in office. \"I've been disappointed by politics since the day I was born,\" he says. \"The historic part of him being elected president was got, and everyone was happy about that, and I'm glad I lived to see it. The flipside is, after we get over that, it's back to the politics, and it's something which doesn't have time for people. It's its own animal.\"</p> <p>This campaign season in the US has exposed this very tension \u2013 for rappers and for Obama. For their part, many rap artists are clearly torn between their allegiance to the first black president and their desire to be straight about conditions on the ground. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Vu-h4PgOk\" title=\"\">The Wu-Tang Clan's track Never Feel This Pain</a>, released last June, offers a lyrical glimpse of this ambivalence. Referring to Obama, Inspectah Deck says: \"I never doubted him. I'm proud of him.\" However, these lyrics of encouragement are sandwiched between those of frustration. Speaking of his desire for a better life, he says, \"I ain't waitin' for Obama,\" and continues: \"Seein' is believin', my vision is blurred, 'cause I ain't seein' nothin' I&#xa0;heard, really nothin' but words.\" Album reviews have either read this as criticism or endorsement, but it's not that simple.</p> <p>Nor is it for Obama. Facing a struggling economy and a crazy-eyed opposition that has dragged US political discourse to the right, he appears to be striking a&#xa0;centrist tone in order to reach crucial swing voters. This may indeed be the strategy he must follow if he wants a second term, but it's one that situates him firmly within the very political establishment rappers have long held in contempt.</p> <p><em>Erik Nielson is assistant professor of liberal arts at the University of Richmond, USA</em></p>",

One in 10 believed the perpetrator of Norway's worst peacetime massacre could not be considered responsible for his actions.</p> <p>Breivik has said if the court finds him insane it would be \"a \"fate worse than death\". The credibility of his rightwing ideology and claim to be protecting Norway from a Muslim takeover would be dismissed as the rantings of a madman.</p> <p>Breivik's lawyers confirmed they would appeal against any ruling that declared him insane.</p> <p>The five district court judges have had to evaluate Breivik's mental state after being presented with two psychiatric evaluations that sharply contradict each other. A court-ordered assessment concluded he was a paranoid schizophrenic; a second report in early April ruled that he was not psychotic. Despite signs of narcissistic and anti-social personality disorder, it said Breivik was sufficiently sane to face a prison sentence.</p> <p>The prosecutor, Svein Holden, has said any doubt must favour an insanity judgement. \"In our opinion it is worse that a psychotic person is sentenced to preventative detention than a non-psychotic person is sentenced to compulsory mental healthcare,\" he said. The wishes of the defendant were an irrelevance.</p> <p>The far-right militant targeted Oslo's government buildings with a car bomb before embarking on a shooting spree that killed 69 at the ruling Labour party's youth camp on the island of Utoya.</p> <p>Yesterday, most Oslo residents seemed adament that he should be jailed.</p> <p>Standing opposite Oslo's central court house, account manager Harry Aass, 29, said: \"It would be ridiculous if he did not go to jail, people would be genuinely fraught.\"</p> <p>Oyuind Bryde, a 35-year-old new media executive, said Norway risked being seen as too lenient.</p> <p>\"If he does not got to jail then it will reinforce the caricature of Norway as na\u00efve, but then we are an open society and maybe it is important that we do not let one man change us.\"</p> <p>Elisabeth Heier, 50, an Oslo social worker, said Breivik's planning of the twin attacks \u2013 his own manifesto charts a precise campaign to build the bomb that hit Oslo and accumulate the firearms he used to target Labour Party youngsters on Utoya, was evidence of a functioning, rational mind.</p> <p>\"From the outside it might look insane but the deliberate execution makes things different,\" she said.</p> <p>But for some, a verdict of insanity would constitute the most potent punishment for Breivik is sufficient to hope he is consigned to the . \"If that hurts him the most then that is what he should receive,\" said tax inspector Ingfrid Aas, 47.</p> <p>Experts have said, however, that the verdict as immaterial. Whether considered sane or not, Breivik will almost certainly never be freed. The maximum jail term in Norway is 21 years but can be extended if Breivik is still deemed a threat to society.</p>",
  "<p>Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi will exercise his legislative mandate to prohibit the detention of journalists, after a court on Thursday remanded into custody a newspaper editor standing trial for defaming him.</p> <p>The court ruled that Islam Afifi, whose newspaper has been critical of Morsi and warned of dire consequences of Brotherhood rule in Egypt, should be detained until his next hearing in September. However, shortly after the ruling, the vice-president, Mahmoud Mekki, told the El-Badil newspaper that Morsi intends to pass a law to prohibit the detention of journalists in such cases, using legislative powers he possesses in the absence of parliament.</p> <p>Afifi, the editor of Al-Dustour, is on trial for various charges, including \"insulting the president\", which is a crime in Egypt. He is also charged with spreading rumours that have disturbed the peace and harmed the public interest.</p> <p>Other journalists also face similar charges related to insulting Morsi \u2013 and by extension the Muslim Brotherhood \u2013 in the press. Among them are two editors, Adel Hamouda of El-Fagr and Abdel-Halim Qandil of Sawt Al-Umma. A satellite-TV \"shock jock\", Tawfik Okasha, faces a different charge \u2013 of threatening on-air to kill Morsi.</p> <p>The president's intention, however, has not spared Afifi, who has been sent to Torah prison to serve the detention order. The case has raised concerns about press freedom. Advocacy group Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) condemned Afifi's detention and called for the right to detain journalists on trial to be struck from the law. It pointed out that under Egyptian law, journalists cannot be detained for publishing crimes with the exception of the charge of insulting the president, an exception kept by ousted president Hosni Mubarak.</p> <p>EIPR lawyer Adel Ramadan said: \"We didn't expect this shocking decision. There is already a decision to ban him from travelling. Why detain him as well?\"</p> <p>However, Mahmoud Helmy, the former MP and member of the Islamic Brotherhood's political arm the Freedom and Justice Party, said this was not a case of settling scores with critics of the group. \"It is vital in the transition to democracy that the rule of law is enforced. We are not into settling scores: we were the first to suffer from extraordinary laws\u2026 We care about the rule of law \u2013 and while it is fine to criticise, we won't allow anyone to cross legal boundaries without being held accountable.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's no doubt that Todd Akin's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-defiant-leaders-withdraw-support?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">stunningly misguided understanding of female anatomy</a>, as seen in his claim that raped women can't get pregnant, represented yet another instance of the Republican party's estrangement from science. But the GOP's refusal to grapple with facts goes beyond biology: there's some very basic mathematics that they appear ignorant of as well.</p> <p>The polling showing just how unpopular the party's official anti-abortion position (adopted by the platform committee this week and identical to the policy that Akin tried to use junk science to support) is as follows: just 20% of Americans believe abortion should be \"illegal in all circumstances\", compared to 25% who say that it should \"always be legal\" and the vast majority \u2013 52% \u2013 who say that it should be \"legal only under certain circumstances\".</p> <p>You can make the party's official position compatible with the more moderate view of the actual Republican candidates only with a kind of magical thinking. This was well put by the party chairman <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reince_Priebus\" title=\"\">Reince Priebus</a> earlier this week: \"This is the platform of the Republican party. It's not the platform of Mitt Romney.\" Ta da! Pay no attention to the men behind the curtain. Hey, look: there's Ann!</p> <p>Ann Romney and 14 other women will speak at the Republican national convention (where the platform will be officially adopted) \u2013 almost half of the full list of those invited to address the gathering. But those women dress a campaign stage on which actual female elected officials are outnumbered by men about 10 to one, a gender gap that probably doesn't alarm Republican political operatives so much as the equally stark gap that exists in the polls.</p> <p>In at least three swing states \u2013 Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia \u2013 Romney trails Obama by over 20% among women. My own fealty to the scientific method prevents me from drawing a definitive conclusion about the cause and effect connection between those numbers and the fact that the same three states have in the past year seen GOP state representatives push some of the nation's most restrictive legislation regarding access to abortion: Pennsylvania lawmakers would have trumped Virginia's now-notorious \"transvaginal ultrasound\" requirement by forcing women to accept personal copies of the ultrasound. Ohio Republicans tried to criminalize all abortions where a \"fetal heartbeat\" could be heard.</p> <p>But I do believe the disconnect between Romney and female voters parallels the disconnect that motivates Republicans to so zealously interfere with women's reproductive functions: they just don't know women that well. In a party so dominated by men, do GOP officials even get a chance to think about the women in their lives in a way that is more intimate than a voting booth?</p> <p>Civil rights for oppressed minorities have always increased with the integration of those minorities into public (and private) life. Martin Luther King&#xa0;Jr's eloquent speeches brought black Americans' struggles into people's living rooms. The quiet normalcy of gay couples has propelled acceptance of gay marriage. And living and working with women as equals forces men to think of them as more than their parts.</p> <p>Respect for women's reproductive choices, and the fraught circumstances that can surround the decision to get an abortion, doesn't even come from knowing women who have been raped \u2013 it comes from knowing women.</p> <p>Akin unwittingly illuminated that context. Our national conversation about the definition of rape made clear the larger social issues that fade when we focus so narrowly on \"abortion\". When we talk about access to abortion, the subject is really women's rights and lives and not a medical procedure.</p> <p>Someone dealing with the actual decision to terminate a pregnancy isn't ignoring the issue that dominates pro-life legislation \u2013 the moment when life begins \u2013 she is simply unable to ignore the other questions that need to be answered: is she ready for a child? Who is the child's father \u2013 and is he ready? And, yes, how does she feel about the act that brought the child into being?</p> <p>You can square the polls showing growth in the number of Americans who call themselves \"pro-life\" with the still-large majority of Americans who believe that there are some cases when abortion should be legal if you keep in mind that the most important conversations we have about abortion aren't with pollsters. They're with the women thinking about the questions above. What's more, most Americans know that calling yourself \"pro-life\" is not the same as robbing someone else of their choice. Here's another example of how Akin and his compatriots could use a maths lesson. His argument about whether or not women who are raped even need abortions is relevant to policy (rather than to science alone) because Akin (along with vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan) last year sought via HR3, the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h3/text\" title=\"\">No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act</a>, to ban any federal money going to pay for any abortion, even if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.</p> <p>Akin justified the cruelty of that position with junk science, but he might well just have done some economic research to see if such a restriction was warranted. The Hyde amendment already bans most federal funding for abortions and in 2001, the last year for which there is public data, only 81 women received abortions paid for by government funds.</p> <p>This compared to 251 congressmen who voted for HR3. It would probably behove Akin and the bill's other supporters (just about a 10th of which were women) to make individual appeals to those women rather than use the impersonal bludgeon of congressional legislation to force their actions. The question as to whether those individual appeals would be effective is another issue.</p> <p>In fact, one wonders if in sitting down with a rape or incest survivor, these politicians might find themselves the ones whose convictions waiver.</p>",
  "<p>The possibility of an oil boom around the Falkland Islands which could further inflame tension between Britain and Argentina was raised on Thursday with \"exciting\" new well results and details on a separate \u00a32bn production plan.</p> <p>Shares in Borders &amp; Southern rocketed 59% after the London-listed company reported positive results from the latest geological tests increasing the chance of a second commercial oil and gas discovery, this one off the south of the islands.</p> <p>Premier Oil meanwhile unveiled new details of a $3.2bn (\u00a32bn) plan to develop the first oil off the north of the island despite reservations from some in the City about the scale of the scheme and legal threats from Argentina.</p> <p>Premier said the more expensive plan would involve buying a floating production and storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel to handle oil from 22 subsea wells in the South Atlantic.</p> <p>But the government in Buenos Aires is using this year's 30 year anniversary of the Falklands War as an opportunity to restate its claims to control the islands, known as the Malvinas.</p> <p>The Argentinian foreign ministry recently wrote to British oil companies working offshore threatening court action unless they brought drilling to a halt.</p> <p>The explorers seem undaunted. Borders said the initial yield from gas condensate samples taken at its well in the South Falkland basin varied from 123 to 140 standard barrels per million cubic feet, more than the level analysts said was needed for commercial potential.</p> <p>\"It definitely looks good...What [the numbers] mean is that essentially this is a commercial discovery, the first in the South Falkland basin,\" said Sanjeev Bahl, an analyst at Numis Securities.</p> <p>\"There's potentially more adjacent discoveries to be made, because it's not going to be the only large condensate discovery in the South Falkland basin,\" added the analyst.</p> <p>Borders chalked up success in April, when it found gas condensate at its first well, but disappointed with a dry well last month sending its shares crashing downwards.</p> <p>Premier first needs to tie up a $700m deal with rival, Rockhopper Exploration, giving it access to the Sea Lion field. It expects to do this by October and hopes to see first oil flowing by 2017.A detailed presentation was given to City analysts as Premier reported record pre-tax profits of $194.6m, up from the same period of last year at $32.5m.</p> <p>Industry experts said a second development by Borders would give critical mass to the Falklands as a new oil \"province.\" This would help stock market confidence, make it potentially easier to physically develop the oil with more companies in the region as well as making it harder for Argentina to legally harrass individual companies.</p> <p>The British government has promised to stand by its oil explorers and believes Buenos Aires would be unable to enforce any court judgements against UK firms outside of Argentina.</p>",

Instead her husband, Matthew Freud, and a small team of advisers largely from within Shine helped check facts and polish the speech \u2013 the first time a woman has given the television industry's signature address since Janet Street-Porter in 1996. </p> <p>It was hailed with warm applause and whistles from the audience, by contrast with the BBC-bashing speech of her brother James, three years ago at the same event, which was greeted coolly.</p> <p>Elisabeth is the second oldest of Rupert Murdoch's six children, and the eldest by his second marriage to Anna. While brothers Lachlan and James have at various times worked directly for News Corp in the past decade, Elisabeth only rejoined her father's company last year after it bought Shine in a \u00a3290m deal just before the phone-hacking affair broke.</p> <p>She had set up Shine in 2001 and banked about \u00a3150m from her father's company once the takeover was completed. But she turned down a seat on the News Corp board in the wake of the Milly Dowler hacking scandal.</p> <p>There was conspicuous praise for the BBC, which frequently airs Shine programmes, in marked contrast to her father and brother. \"Let me put it on the record that I am a current supporter of the BBC's universal licence fee,\" she said. She also praised outgoing director general Mark Thompson for working collaboratively across the television industry. Three years ago, James Murdoch accused the BBC of expansionist plans that had \"a chilling effect\" on the rest of the British media, but his sister's only critical observation about the national broadcaster was that the incoming director general had \"to demonstrate how efficiently that funding is being spent on actual content on behalf of the licence fee payers\".</p> <p>There was little overt politicising in Elisabeth Murdoch's speech \u2013 another contrast with her brother's effort, which was widely seen as setting the template for Conservative media policy before the most recent general election.</p> <p>But she repeatedly gestured towards liberal values with references to progressive political figures, including \"one of my heroes\" Vaclav Havel and Nelson Mandela whom she watched walk from prison \"through my tears\".</p> <p>There was even praise for another former MacTaggart lecturer, the late Dennis Potter, who famously named the cancer that killed him \"Rupert\". She said she was \"firmly with\" the television playwright who said \"the job of television is to make hearts pound\" \u2013 a vision of the medium whose core purpose is \"to form human connections\" as opposed to a vehicle for the exercise of raw political power.</p> <p>But she did defend her decision to sell Shine to her father's company \u2013 even if, as she acknowledged, it appeared to be a \"no shit, Sherlock\" decision \u2013 because News Corp was first and foremost a content company which had backed The Simpsons, Glee and the blockbuster films Titantic and Avatar directed by James Cameron.</p> <p>While there was no shortage of criticism for her brother, there was praise for one Murdoch, her father.</p> <p>\"My dad had the vision, the will and the sense of purpose to challenge the old world order on behalf of the people,\" she said, before adding: \"But back even then, I understood we were in pursuit of a greater good, a belief in better.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Simon Warburton, deputy headteacher of a large secondary school, Hertfordshire</strong></h2> <p>Dear parents,</p> <p>You might be a tad confused about the concern over GSCE English grades and buzz words such as zero-sum but allow me to present you with a scenario that might help.</p> <p>Imagine your son or daughter has worked doggedly over the past two years in their English studies. They have applied themselves really well with their controlled assessments in class and all their mock exams have indicated that they have a great chance of a C grade in the summer. This is great news as they need the C to get on the college course that they have set their heart on.</p> <p>Fast forward to this morning \u2013 they open the envelope and find a D in English, and your son or daughter is told that there is no point asking for a remark as all the C grades for this year have been allocated. It would seem that across the nation lots of students have worked hard this year and, as a result, the exam boards have set a C grade at 10 points higher than they did for the same exam in January. It would seem that what really matters to the government is that exams are seen to be harder so they would like to see an end to 'grade inflation'. What they call grade inflation, I would call expert teaching and a desire to help your students get the best opportunities in life, but there you go.</p> <p>This is what zero sum means \u2013 over the next few years we are being told to expect no increases in grades. How students did last year has set a bar for the students in the future and no matter what students or teachers do it will make no difference.</p> <p>This is a scandalous point of view; it is also a killer blow to social mobility and raising aspirations. From a school leader point of view, and as someone who is charged with improving teaching and learning, it totally undermines any initiative to support teachers to become better at their craft. You could be forgiven for being cynical and thinking that students are being punished for teachers being good at their job. Why else would someone want to limit the grades being awarded? It seems that the A* and A grades are broadly similar but, yet again, it is the ones who struggle to lift their chances in life who are hit the hardest \u2013 those aspiring for C grades to get into further education.</p> <p>This alteration of the grade boundaries broke last night - on Twitter. There was no guidance from the exam boards, no edict from the secretary of state, (who has been notable in his absence in the media today) just headteachers, striving to do the best for their students, sharing concerns that the grades looked to be at least 10% under expectations. It shouldn't be the case that we are discovering educational policy by proxy or having revolutionary law changes such as the removal of QTS on the opening day of the Olympics. Teachers are struggling against the relentless tide of Mr Gove's initiatives and ultimately, in the absence of any serious opposition from the shadow secretary of state, it is your children who are being harmed the most.</p> <h2><strong>David Didau, director of English and literacy, Somerset</strong></h2> <p>Well, the results are finally out and show a decrease in A* to C grades of about 1.5%. Dramatic but nowhere near as catastrophic as was being predicted in some quarters.</p> <p>For myself, I have a vested interest in two schools having just started a new job. My previous school's results were a healthy 83% - down almost exactly 1.5% on last year but well below the 90% we had confidently predicted based on the information the exam board had made available and assured us was \"set in stone\". My new school's results are 69% - down almost 11% from last year. Both centres use AQA for English.</p> <p>My gripe is not that the results have decreased, it's not even that grade boundaries clearly changed significantly between the January and June entries, it's that the AQA said categorically the 'pass mark' of 180 UMS points would not under any circumstances change.</p> <p>Having entered students for their examined component in January, we had a very clear sense of exactly how well students needed to do to reach this 180 pass mark. Not being an especially trusting sort, I even told students that they needed to get 184 UMS marks before they could consider themselves 'safe'. The bitter experience of 14 students who had achieved at least 185 UMS marks and were, according to AQA, certain of receiving a C grade is that they have failed.</p> <p>If this retrospective decision to fail them is based in any way on political expediency then whoever is responsible should feel very ashamed.</p> <h2><strong>Liz Cooke, peripatetic 1:1 teacher of English employed by state schools in inner London</strong></h2> <p>I work with year 8 and 9 teaching English 1:1 (the school managed to find some money to continue the Making Good Progress programme). The only common factor among the young people I work with is that something very difficult and challenging is happening at home - major family disruption, economic disaster, illness (child or parent), no one at home speaking English, domestic violence - the list can go on. After three years of teaching 1:1 in years 5 and 6 as well as 7 and 8, I continued to use the motivation of improving levels of achievement. Can I, in all honesty, continue to do that after today's news?</p> <p>I am (semi) retired. I I have an MA in English, a PGCE English and media studies, many years experience in primary and secondary, deputy head, inclusion manager - I possibly have more hands on experience than the heads of Ofqual, Ofsted and our esteemed education secretary. But I'm silenced by their ilk. We are creating huge numbers of disenfranchised, disillusioned and despairing young people. The grades are part of it. Am I a conspiracy theorist? Perhaps I don't need to be.</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Maria Baronova wasn't at home on the morning eight masked officers armed with Kalashnikovs broke down her front door. They took troves of family photos, four laptops, a bunch of books and several white ribbons \u2013 the symbol of the protest movement opposed to Vladimir Putin. They took a pin with a pink triangle, a symbol of gay rights activism. They even took an ultrasound from when she was pregnant with her son six years ago. \"I later asked them \u2013 do you think my child was planning unrest?\" Baronova, 28, said.</p> <p>While the eyes of the world have been focused on the three members of the punk band Pussy Riot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-prison-putin\" title=\"\">who were last week jailed for hooliganism</a> \u2013 in a case that has prompted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/human-rights-critics-russia-ecuador\" title=\"\">widespread condemnation of Russia's politicised justice system and crackdown on freedom of expression</a> \u2013 dozens of others have also been caught up in what activists warn is a burgeoning repression of the opposition.</p> <p>Baronova is one of more than a dozen people charged in connection with an anti-Putin protest held on 6 May, the eve of his inauguration. It was the only protest to turn violent, with clashes between protesters and riot police erupting after thousands of demonstrators were prevented from entering the rally site. In the weeks that followed, injured riot police were handed free flats. Baronova and others were charged with provoking mass unrest and face up to two years in prison if found guilty.</p> <p>Since then, her life has been turned upside down. She devotes countless hours every week to meeting with her lawyer and officials from Russia's Investigative Committee, which raided her flat in early June. Although others have been confined to pre-detention centres, Baronova has been banned from leaving Moscow.</p> <p>In late June, she was visited by social services, who said they had received a complaint about her parenting of her five-year-old son. They searched the flat and asked why she had English-language books, why there were cigarettes on the kitchen table, whether the violin aligned with sanitary norms. \"That's when I realised I'm in a nuthouse,\" she said.</p> <p>Though under investigation, Baronova didn't stop her activism. When floods ravaged the southern town of Krymsk in July, killing more than 170 people, she helped organise a massive donation effort amid criticism of the government's response. Soon, she began receiving odd phone calls. Coming home with her son and boyfriend one night, she was confronted with vulgar graffiti scrawled across the door with her flat along with the words: \"Bitch, return the money, evil creature\".</p> <p>\"There is no doubt that there has been a turn in the policy toward those defiant Russians who dare challenge the government,\" said Masha Lipman, an experienced analyst at Moscow's Carnegie Centre. \"In addition to the cases that have become public, there is a lot of intimidation going on.\"</p> <p>Opposition activists have been at pains to publicise the harassment. Earlier this month, Alexey Navalny, an anti-corruption activist who has become the opposition's de facto leader, livetweeted the discovery of a bugging device in his office.</p> <p>A week earlier he was charged with embezzlement and banned from leaving the country. Navalny has called the charges, which allege in 2009 he organised a scheme to steal timber from a state-owned company while acting as an adviser to a regional governor, absurd. He faces up to ten years in prison if found guilty. A similar case against him was closed earlier this year.</p> <p>At the reading of the verdict against Pussy Riot last week, defence lawyers tried to usher Navalny and Baronova into the courtroom, to the dismay of many journalists gathered outside pushing to get in. \"What they don't understand is \u2013 we're next,\" Baronova said.</p> <p>Baronova worked as a sales manager at a chemical supply company until she began devoting all her time to the opposition movement following Putin's announcement in September that he would be returning to the presidency. Many were outraged at the idea that the man who has ruled Russia since 2000 could return for two six-year terms. \"I realised my kid would be 18 in 12 years and I will be 40 \u2013 I'll have to live my whole youth with him,\" she said.</p> <p>Some 400 people were arrested on and around the 6 May protest. \"We knew people were detained, but we were all busy with our own stuff,\" Baronova said. \"We didn't know these people or what was really happening.\"</p> <p>Since then, the ominous signs have grown, Lipman said. The Duma, Russia's parliament, passed a series of laws that appear to be designed to rein-in an opposition movement that has brought tens of thousands of people into the streets, and tens of thousands more into critical forums online. New laws have drastically raised fines for illegal protest and another law has created an internet blacklist that activists fear could be used to censor online content. Non-governmental organisations that receive foreign grants are now required to identify themselves as \"foreign agents\".</p> <p>Opposition deputies have also come under pressure. Gennady Gudkov, a member of the Just Russia party who issued stark warnings in the autumn of the coming popular discontent, has seen the Investigative Committee investigate his private business and threaten to bring charges of illegal profiteering, in a move his supporters say is a means of political revenge. At least four activists who were at the 6 May protest have fled the country amid fears charges will be brought against them.</p> <p>Baronova said it would be a \"moral crime\" to flee. Anyway, her ex-husband has long refused to provide the necessary permission for her to leave Russia with her son, disrupting her plans to get a PhD abroad. \"That's when I had the feeling of being in jail,\" she said. \"I'm tired of being in a cold civil war.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ethiopia's state TV broke the news of the death of prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/21/meles-zenawi-dropout-prime-minister\" title=\"\">Meles Zenawi</a> on Monday night. For weeks, little had been known not only of his health, but also of his whereabouts. Within a few hours world leaders publicly mourned the loss of a figure praised for his diplomatic skills and ability to mediate between competing interests in the region. For the African Union, headquartered in Addis Ababa, \"the death of Prime Minister Meles <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/meles-zenawi-death-fears-turmoil?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">has robbed Africa</a> of one of its greatest sons\".</p> <p>Most articles in the international media strived to strike a difficult balance: on one hand, the notable skills of a premier who brought double-digit growth to one of the poorest countries on the continent, and on the other, a brutal ruler who ordered police and soldiers to fire on protesters in the aftermath of the contested 2005 elections.</p> <p>Social media have, however, offered a more complex picture, signalling the problematic legacy of a figure who took Ethiopia in unprecedented directions \u2013 for instance, he recognised ethnic diversity as a building block of the nation while most post-colonial African states attempted to overcome it. But by doing so, he also polarised the political debate among his supporters and adversaries. On Facebook, the words \"dictator\", \"saviour\", \"murderer\" and \"visionary\" were blending on many a post reflecting on his death.</p> <p>These mixed reactions indicate that Africa has lost one of its most notable contemporary ideologues. After the end of the cold war many African leaders progressively adhered, at least nominally, to a technocratic approach to governance and relinquished any ideologically charged language. On the contrary, during his 21 years in office, Meles continued to actively elaborate concepts negotiating his Marxist-Leninist training with a pragmatic approach to democracy, which the international community was advocating.</p> <p>And while Meles has been hailed as an ally of the west in the volatile Horn of Africa, he leveraged the geopolitical weight obtained by providing a base to fight terrorism in the region to undertake paths that, at policy level, openly challenged the western doctrine. In recent years, he often claimed that the neo-liberal model of development had failed, and that a paradigm shift was needed. He expanded the role of the state when donors were asking to reduce it, and turned new media into <a href=\"http://www.soros.org/reports/mapping-digital-media-digital-media-conflict-and-diasporas-horn-africa\" title=\"\">supports</a> for his centrally controlled state and nation-building project, against those who emphasised their importance as vehicles to promote open and unfettered debates.</p> <p>This ideologue image progressively obtained a life of its own. Numerous texts officially published by the party were considered to be his, and he was believed to occasionally enjoy participating in \"doctrinal\" debates online under a pseudonym. A <a href=\"http://cgt.columbia.edu/files/conferences/Zenawi_Dead_Ends_and_New_Beginnings.pdf\" title=\"\">51-page document</a> Meles published as part of a conversation with development economists such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/josephstiglitz\" title=\"\">Joseph Stiglitz</a> became a rallying point for academics and policymakers alike. Many African leaders looked up to Meles because, despite his young age \u2013 he died at 57 \u2013 he showed the traits that characterised key post-independence leaders, such as the willingness and ability to theorise and defend a path towards development that was distinctive for Africa. As a Ghanaian diplomat once told me, referring to a quarrel between Meles and Eritrea's president, Isaias Afewerki, during an African Union meeting, it was impressive how Meles was able to hold his ground during a doctrinal debate, while all the rest of the assembly was quietly listening.</p> <p>Meles's role as an ideologue, however, came at a cost for the Ethiopian people. First, it made him uninterested and intolerant towards most forms of critique of his policies. Despite having a government that initially created a space for a free press, it consistently avoided engaging with the debates it had allowed to flourish. After 2005, this lack of engagement turned into active suppression, with many journalists imprisoned and access to opposition blogs blocked. Second, Meles's drive to implement his ambitious vision turned into a need to secure political hegemony for an extended period of time. The process of transforming Ethiopia into an ethnic federation through trial and errors led the political leadership to maintain control often through violence and repression.</p> <p>Meles's passing leaves the country at a crossroads. Ethiopia's spokespeople have said that the new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, will continue along the path ploughed by his predecessor. But it is difficult to imagine Meles's policies being brought to life without the ideological drive he was able to lead with. Such measures could facilitate an \"opening of political space\" as advocated by <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/21/ethiopia-transition-should-support-human-rights-reform\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a>, but it could also lead to the crumbling of a project requiring strong leadership in the absence of a viable replacement.</p>",
  "<p>When I went to university in the late 1970s, fewer than 20% of school leavers went on to higher education. Some degrees were clearly vocational (medicine perhaps the most obvious example), but most were not. My module on the Comparative Government of Indonesia and Nigeria has not, I'm afraid to say, been of direct relevance to me in the world of work.</p> <p>However, a degree did give graduates an experience that most of their contemporaries did not have and with that experience some unique opportunities. The 'Milk Round' university recruiting fairs, run by large often blue-chip organisations, offered a route into management that was by and large exclusive to graduates.</p> <p>Wind forward 35 years and the Milk Round is no more. The UK now has 50% of school leavers going on to universities to do a degree, competition for graduate level jobs has hugely increased and, significantly, universities are now measured and compared on the number of their graduates that get 'graduate level' jobs. However, employer organisations, including the CBI, regularly criticise universities for failing to give students the skills they need to operate in the world of work.</p> <p>In response to this criticism, UK universities have developed a series of initiatives to ensure that the 'student experience' \u2013 both in degree courses run and extra-curricular opportunities provided \u2013 give students the competencies that employers want. Compared with the late 1970s, employability is now a strong feature of nearly all degree courses.</p> <p>There has also been a dramatic rise in the number of enterprise clubs or societies, often run by students themselves, providing comprehensive support to help students start their own businesses. In the East Midlands, <a href=\"http://www.enterpriseinc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Enterprise Inc. scheme</a> run across nine universities, even provides funding to would-be entrepreneurs.</p> <h2>The opportunities for social enterprise</h2> <p>The public sector in the UK is going through a decade of transformation. Irrespective of which party is in power, the way services have been delivered to the public has been changing, and will continue to change. It is becoming clear that we have been living in a fools' paradise, treating ourselves to ever more public services that we have not been able to afford.</p> <p>At the same time, the UK private sector is also experiencing severe shocks to its system. Although the private sector has delivered some impressive growth in employment opportunities, the European \u2013 US financial crisis and the exposure of many banking practices, is bringing the fundamentals of the economy into question (and we saw it coming \u2013 or should have \u2013 if you want to know why read Niall Ferguson's book <em>The Ascent of Money</em>, especially chapter six).</p> <p>These tectonic shifts in the economy have created new opportunities for the UK's long-established social enterprise sector. All mainstream political parties in the UK are voicing support for a more mixed economy, with a strong social enterprise sector delivering products and services in innovative and responsible ways. Legislation has been passed to support the sector and attitudes and practices are changing (albeit rather too slowly for many social entrepreneurs). Initiatives such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jul/02/procurement-in-universities\" title=\"\">\u00a31bn University Challenge</a> are increasing the opportunities for social enterprises to get high value, long-term contracts from the public sector.</p> <h2>Social enterprise and the student experience</h2> <p>The growing opportunities for the social enterprise sector demand a response from universities which is being met. Nearly all UK universities have initiatives that provide educational and practical opportunities to get involved in social enterprise. Student run initiatives such as the Cambridge Hub (<a href=\"http://www.cambridgehub.org\" title=\"\">'Connecting students with causes')</a> are particularly impressive, as is the <a href=\"http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=37825\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise Network of universities</a> run by the University of Plymouth which is doing some impressive research into the fundamentals of social enterprise.</p> <p>For its part, Northampton University, has developed and implemented an institution-wide social enterprise strategy. It covering a wide spectrum of activities ranging from support for students to set up social enterprises (including providing them with start up funding) to using our intellectual capital to try and influence policy and practice \u2013 all parts of the spectrum are equally important to us. After all, there is no point in developing student social entrepreneurs if we don't help develop a thriving social enterprise sector for them to work in.</p> <p>The student experience is different, and better, than it was when I went to university. In 2012 a university education is still about becoming an expert in a chosen field and, I hope, learning to think in new ways, but it is increasingly and overtly about preparation for employment \u2013 and that includes employment in the social enterprise sector.</p> <p><em>Simon Denny is social enterprise development director at </em><a href=\"http://www.northampton.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Northampton University</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Todd Akin, the embattled Republican Senate candidate whose remarks on \"legitimate rape\" prompted calls for him to exit the Missouri race, is now 10 points behind his rival, according to a Rasmussen poll released on Thursday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_senate_elections/missouri/questions_2012_missouri_senate_august_22_2012\">The poll</a>, which also found 63% of voters now view him unfavourably, is a major blow to the candidate who has haemorrhaged support from his party since his remarks on Sunday. Only last week, he was <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=ee08561c-b5c6-45c1-b62b-be0abddcfb85\">leading by nine points</a>, according to one poll. </p> <p>Carried out on Wednesday, three days after his comments on abortion and rape, the new poll shows Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent, with 48% and Akin with 38%. The new figures show a big swing from the previous Rasmussen poll in July in which he came out three points ahead.</p> <p>Of those who responded to the poll, 47% said they now have a very unfavourable view of Akin, while 16% said they had a somewhat unfavourable view of him. However, when asked if Akin should drop out of the race, 42% said no and 41% said yes.</p> <p>The Missouri seat is an important one for Republicans, because it was seen as one of the most winnable for them. The Republicans, already in control of the House, are four seats away from taking control of the Senate.</p> <p>In a further setback for Akin, he has raised just $100,000 in an online fundraising drive that he called a message to \"party bosses\" about his commitment to the Missouri Senate race. </p> <p>That is well below the amount he needs to keep his campaign afloat after he lost the funding of major backers, including $5m from the conservative Super Pac Crossroads GPS. The National Republican Senatorial Campaign also pulled funding.</p> <p>Akin posted on Twitter that thousands of donors had come forward to help him surpass the fundraising target he sought to achieve by the end of Wednesday.</p> <p>His jubilant Twitter message that \"voters should pick candidates not party bosses\" came before the latest poll results.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ToddAkin/status/238615979117142016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Thousands of people stepped up and helped us raise over $100,000!

But some have done far worse than they expected and this has caused a lot of concern.</p> <p><strong>Why have the top grades fallen?</strong></p> <p>A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ASCL_UK/statuses/238395969295773697\" title=\"\">number</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SambrookToni/statuses/238534915472375808\" title=\"\">teachers</a> and <a href=\"http://community.tes.co.uk/forums/t/597792.aspx?PageIndex=1\" title=\"\">headteachers</a> have blamed the department of education for pressurising the exam boards to deflate grades. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/22/english-gcses-marked-down-teachers?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Bill Watkin, operational director of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, said</a>: \"It would appear that changes to grade boundaries have resulted in a discrepancy between predicted results and actual results in a number of schools. What I've been told is that the grade boundary change has resulted in a high number of children just below the boundary \u2026 heads are understandably focusing on the C/D boundary.\"</p> <p>What is clear is that exams, the way they are marked and the way they are taken have changed even since last year. This is not to be confused with (arguably larger)<a href=\"http://web.aqa.org.uk/defuddler/?utm_source=00&amp;utm_medium=bnr&amp;utm_content=gc&amp;utm_campaign=01\" title=\"\"> changes that are taking place in the next few years</a> which stem from the government's white paper The Importance of Teaching, published in November 2010 and including things like marks for spelling and grammar. There are a number of substantial changes which have affected this year's outcome.</p> <p><strong>What are the changes to GCSE exams?</strong></p> <p>1. This group is the first cohort which has completed \"unitised\" GCSE in all subjects. Unitised in this context means the examination is made into units or modulesrather than taken in one chunk at the end of the year.</p> <p>2. The second change is that with more units there appears to be more controlled assessment, something which started in 2009. Controlled assessments are <a href=\"http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/qualifications-assessments/89-articles/21-gcse-controlled-assessments\" title=\"\">explained here</a> and replaced coursework. This change may be more significant, as it appears to be where most of the downgrading of marks has occurred.</p> <p>3. The third change \u2013 of sorts \u2013 is the way the grade boundary shifts for different grades and different subjects. This boundary decides what kind of mark, say 58%, gets what kind of grade, say C grade or perhaps B. This change happens for every exam period, every year, but this year these boundary changes seemed to have had a greater effect than normal, especially around the controlled assessments.</p> <p>4. The fourth change is the appearance of exams watchdog Ofqual in 2010, replacing the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. There are a number of privately-run exam boards which <a href=\"http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Ofqual</a> oversees, to assure the quality of qualifications such as GCSEs and A-levels. As Ofqual puts it on its website: \"It is our duty to ensure all learners get the results they deserve and that their qualifications are correctly valued and understood, now and in the future.\"</p> <p>Last month, Glenys Stacey, the chief executive of Ofqual, <a href=\"http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/files/2012-06-03-glenys-stacey-speech-the-future-of-the-examination-system.pdf?Itemid=145\" title=\"\">gave a speech</a> in which she detailed the changes that were happening. She said: \"This summer we will see the outcomes, student results in GCSE science, which we strengthened two years ago. We shall see what difference a more demanding specification \u2013 in effect, the recalibration of the qualification \u2013 makes to grade outcomes, and to achievement. Just to remind you, our future plans for GCSEs include continuing to contain grade inflation using our 'comparable outcomes' approach. Here, those of you in schools can be reassured that we are speaking with Ofsted about the impact this is likely to have on outcomes, on results for individual schools.\"</p> <p><strong>So what is Ofqual's 'comparable outcomes' approach?</strong></p> <p>The short version is that Ofqual has been asking for evidence from exam boards for why grades should go up this year and why they think pupils have done better than the last. This strategy may be the main cause of the shift in results but it is hard to see exactly what is going on behind the scenes. The exam boards, as private companies, are not obliged to disclose information under Freedom of Information legislation.</p> <p><strong>What do the exam boards say?</strong></p> <p>One of the larger exam boards, the AQA, contacted the Guardian to explain that along with every other exam board, it had changed its grade boundaries for English \u2013 one of the core GCSE subjects \u2013 to maintain standards. It said: \"This summer, all the exam boards raised their grade boundaries for GCSE English in order to maintain standards. In AQA's case, this was by between zero and three marks.</p> <p>\"The background to this is that, as you will be aware, students often take their units for a qualification in different exam series. We take account of how students have performed in each exam series when we set grade boundaries, in order to ensure that standards are maintained.</p> <p>\"While grade boundaries can therefore vary between exam series, students can be confident that the grade they get for an overall qualification one year would be the same the next. When work is marked internally by a school or college, as in the case of controlled assessment, we review the standard of work to ensure that it is consistent across the country.</p> <p>\"Our grade boundaries are all approved, and supported, by our regulator Ofqual.\"</p> <p><strong>What does Ofqual have to say about it all?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/news-and-announcements/83-news-and-announcements-news/967-gcse-results\" title=\"\">Its statement from just after midday</a> is pretty long, but it suggests some of the changes in the subjects, including its own scrutiny, as factors for change. It also pinpoints entry patterns as a factor:</p> <p>\"This year, the results overall are quite stable compared to last year. The proportion of students securing A* to C grades is down by 0.4%. One of the main reasons for this is GCSE science, where a drop in pass rates was expected due to changes in the nature and number of candidates taking the exams, and a more demanding new standard being introduced to make sure the qualification was appropriate for GCSE students. The proportion of science candidates who achieved grades A* to C fell 2.2%.</p> <p>\"We are aware that concerns have been raised about results for GCSE English. This summer most students have taken new syllabuses in GCSE English language rather than English. There has [sic] also been changes to the entry patterns of candidates. Approx [sic] 20,000 candidates from independent/selective schools moving [sic] to other qualifications, while overall, the entry was up. This is likely to be the result of fewer students entering early in the winter series and instead being included in the summer results. The proportion of English students achieving an A* to C grade this summer fell by 1.5%.\"</p> <p>Clearly the general amount of change has created unexpected outcomes. And whatever the reasons for the drop in course results, this has made a good number of teachers very angry.</p>",
  "<p>An actor has been indicted for attempting to extort millions of dollars from the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.</p> <p>Vivek Shah, 25, who has had minor roles in films and television shows including Bones and Outsourced, was arrested last week after allegedly threatening to kill members of Weinstein's family unless he wired money to an offshore bank account. </p> <p>Weinstein was one of five people to receive a written threat from Shah in the past two months, <a href=\"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/harvey-weinstein-extortion-plot-723561\">according to an affidavit</a> signed by postal inspector Joshua Mehall. Shah demanded that each target wire millions of dollars to an offshore bank account or he would kill family members who were listed in the letter. </p> <p>According to the affidavit, Shah's other targets include an Illinois resident who co-founded an internet company, a Floridian who founded an oil and gas company and a Texan who is the child of the late founder of another oil and gas company. </p> <p>The affidavit also lists \"a Conneticut resident and co-founder of a film studio\", who is presumed to be Weinstein, the co-founder of Miramax films. Weinstein hosted a $35,800-per-person fundraising dinner for Barack Obama at his Westport, Connecticut home <a href=\"http://connecticut.cbslocal.com/2012/08/21/dnc-refuses-to-reimburse-conn-town-for-overtime-costs-during-obama-visit/\">earlier this month</a>. </p> <p>The only named party in the affidavit is coal magnate Christopher Cline, from whom Shah attempted to extort $13m. Shah is being held in West Virginia, where Cline lives. </p> <p>After federal authorities learned of the threat to Cline, Shah's online purchases and mailbox rentals were tracked and his transactions were captured from store surveillance video. </p> <p>Shah, a West Hollywood resident, was arrested last week at his family's Schaumburg, Illinois home and indicted Wednesday. Records show that Shah had scheduled training at a Los Angeles-area gun range after his planned return to California. </p> <p>He will now face a grand jury in Charleston, on four counts of interfering with interstate commerce and for using interstate commerce to threaten extortion. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gVpA2etTTro9moiJIapaOIUiFAHA?docId=51422436b0f047fbb7c22a88003b605e\">Last week,</a> Weinstein was granted a three-year restraining order against a man who allegedly threatened to shoot him.

  "<p>An African asylum seeker detained in a Libyan detention camp after a failed attempt to enter Europe has told the Guardian about the harsh \u2013 sometimes terrifying \u2013 fate that awaits those who fail in their attempts to flee the continent north across the Mediterranean.</p> <p>\"Kibrom\", whose name has been changed to protect him from reprisals, said he and others like him had been powerless to defend themselves from armed and leaderless former rebel militiamen in the camp where they were dumped. One of their number had been shot and wounded, he said.</p> <p>His account echoed horrifying claims from an asylum seeker at another detention centre near the coastal city of Benghazi, where about 400 Eritreans, Ethiopians and Somalis were held. That detainee, whose allegations were relayed to the Guardian by a Roman Catholic Eritrean priest, Father Moses Zerai, said female asylum seekers had been raped there and about 20 men removed by an armed group for use as slaves. Their whereabouts are unknown.</p> <p>Zerai, who runs an agency from Rome that tracks and assists asylum seekers, said: \"The management of refugees in Libya today is out of the control of the government.\" A request for comment from the Libyan authorities went unanswered.</p> <p>Kibrom, a 31-year-old Eritrean, said 26 hours after leaving the Libyan coast the overloaded rigid inflatable boat in which he was trying to reach Italy began to lose air. It was 2am on 29 June.</p> <p>The migrant traffickers who had arranged the voyage had given them a pay-as-you-go satellite phone, but they had already used what little credit was on it.</p> <p>\"We had seen a ship earlier, so we turned around \u2013 it was our only hope of getting help,\" said Kibrom. Astonishingly, at night and lost in the Mediterranean, they located the vessel. He described it as \"a very big ship\" flying the Italian flag and with the word \"Napoli\" painted on the side. At first, according to Kibrom, the crew did not help.</p> <p>\"They saw us and did nothing. We stayed alongside for an hour or more. And it was only when they could see we were in danger of falling into the sea that they helped us,\" he said.</p> <p>Kibrom and another 75 people were taken aboard. He said none of the crew were wearing uniforms. He could not tell if, at the time, the ship was in Libyan or international waters.</p> <p>The captain decided to hand over his unwanted passengers to the Libyan authorities. The asylum seekers were fetched from the ship and taken to a camp at Sabratha, about 25 miles west of Tripoli, which is also used by the army.</p> <p>For Kibrom, it was the latest of several confinements in an ordeal lasting more than three years. A teacher from Mendefera, south of the Eritrean capital of Asmara, he decided to flee his native land in 2009.</p> <p>He cited as his reason the \"very hard regime\" of Isaias Afewerki and the People's Front for Democracy and Justice. Eritrea is a one-party state with no free media and a sorry history of human rights abuses.</p> <p>Kibrom crossed the border into Sudan. \"There was a man and we paid him to guide us. We walked for 200 kilometres [125 miles]. It took four or five days,\" he said.</p> <p>In Kassala, they were put on a lorry that carried them across the Sahara into Libya. \"Within a few weeks, though, I was caught and put in prison,\" said Kibrom, who makes no distinction between jails and detention camps for migrants.</p> <p>Eight months later, he escaped and fled to Egypt. \"But I was caught by the police and spent about three months in prison there,\" he said.</p> <p>Learning he was to be deported and aware it was an offence to leave Eritrea, \"I told them I was Ethiopian, so they deported me to Ethiopia.\" From there, he returned to Sudan and then Libya.</p> <p>Quite how he managed to fund his journey back is not entirely clear. \"Friends supported me,\" he said. \"Maybe they thought I could help them.\"</p> <p>If they too were dreaming of a future in Europe, they will dismayed \u2013 and perhaps deterred \u2013 by Kibrom's misadventures after he was transferred to Sabratha.</p> <p>\"At the beginning, they were giving us only one piece of bread a day,\" he said. \"It was very, very hard. There was not even any proper drinking water. It was very, very salty.\"</p> <p>He said they received a visit from a representative of the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR. \"One person came. They [sic] gave us food and soap. And then they went away,\" he said.</p> <p>Conditions in the camp, where about 350 people were being held, were dangerous, Kibrom said. He and fellow-detainees lived in fear of the irregulars who last year ousted Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and his regime. \"They can do whatever they like,\" he said. \"They are armed and there is no leader.\"</p> <p>According to Kibrom, a boy \u2013 aged 16 or 17 \u2013 was wounded during a rampage by drunken troops. \"They were shooting, sometimes in the air, but sometimes into the walls. We had bullets come through the door of our room twice,\" he said.</p> <p>Christopher Hein, director of the Italian Council for Refugees, one of whose aid workers in Libya visited the camp at Sabratha, confirmed that a teenage asylum-seeker had been shot. But he gave a different account of events leading up to the incident, which he said took place on 22 July.</p> <p>\"Two days earlier, Ramadan began and they stopped giving food and water to the detainees,\" said Hein. \"The people protested and the guards intervened with firearms.\" He said the boy was taken to hospital. \"Three days later, he returned to the centre.\"</p> <p>Kibrom and about 45 others from the party whose vessel had almost sunk were later moved to Homs, east of Tripoli, which is where he was contacted by the Guardian. Conditions were better there, Kibrom said, but added: \"It really is a prison.\"</p> <p>Asked what he thought might happen now, Kibrom replied: \"They have been saying 'You will go back to your country.' \"</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of supporters of libertarian-leaning Texas congressman Ron Paul will descend on Tampa, Florida, this weekend for a series of events ahead of the Republican National Convention which will nominate Mitt Romney as the party's presidential candidate.</p> <p>There will be several days of concerts, speeches and a rally held by Paul himself that will provide a focus point for a movement that only a few months ago aimed to bring at least 500 party delegates to the Tampa convention in a bid to highlight Paul's anti-war, anti-big government beliefs and provide a potentially embarrassing upset to Romney.</p> <p>But that aim, which saw a \"stealth\" strategy exploit arcane party rules to amass delegate support far beyond what Paul had achieved at the ballot box, now looks like a forlorn hope. </p> <p>The Republican Party machine has largely closed ranks behind Romney and in some cases thinned the ranks of state delegations of some Paul supporters.</p> <p>Now, instead of causing a stir inside the Tampa convention hall, the legions of Paul backers will be mostly visible at things like a three-day music and activism event called Paul Festival, whose acronym stands for People Awakening and Uniting for Liberty. </p> <p>Beginning Friday, Paul Festival features dozens of bands and speakers that range from the producer of a new film of an Ayn Rand novel to Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president. </p> <p>Festival organiser Tracy Diaz said the event would be about energising Ron Paul supporters even as the congressman himself prepares to step down from electoral office and leave politics. \"The aim is to re-energise and celebrate, not only what Ron Paul has achieved, but also what the grassroots has been able to achieve,\" she said.</p> <p>Paul himself will be speaking at a major rally on Sunday at the University of South Florida's Sun Dome arena. The all-day event will feature a roster of speakers touting the causes close to Paul's heart, such as Austrian school economist Walter Block and his own son, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395174381\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345736611692/ron-paul-supporters-006.jpg\" alt=\"ron paul supporters\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\"Ron Paul sees this as a multi-generational project,\" says a University of Iowa professor. Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul spokesman Jesse Benton said the rally would ensure Paul's beliefs got a high profile airing, despite the fact he was not given a speaking slot at the convention. \"No matter the convention outcome the Congressman and his fellow patriots will be heard,\" Benton said.</p> <p>But that voice is not going to be as loud as it might have been. Paul's delegate strategy saw supporters overtake the nomination process in several states, winning large numbers of delegates in places like Massachusetts, Maine and Louisiana. It also saw fierce disputes with party officials, including scuffles that led to arrests and injuries in Louisiana.</p> <p>However, the number of Paul delegates has since been chipped away with several state delegations packed with Paul supporters being virtually tossed out. Talks between the Romney team and the Paul campaign have now reached compromises in many cases, but at a cost of a reduced Paul presence.</p> <p>Evan Kenney is a Massachusetts Ron Paul supporter who first won his delegate place, then saw it denied by the local state party, and then had it reinstated on Wednesday along with four others, leaving 12 Paul supporters still left out. </p> <p>\"It's really tremendous that we did make a difference, but still extremely disheartening that 12 elected representatives were unjustly removed from their rightful positions,\" he said.</p> <p>Kenney believes the movement gathering in Tampa would still make its point no matter whether they were inside or outside the convention hall and would not be effected by the fact that Paul himself was leaving politics. \"It is the liberty movement. The cause is much bigger than Ron Paul,\" he said.</p> <p>Certainly Paul seems to be already leaving the limelight. He has maintained a low media profile in recent months, including refusing repeated interview requests from the Guardian. His team has also urged his supporters to not upset official proceedings in Tampa. </p> <p>Some experts believe that could be down to ensuring a smooth handover of the reins of the movement to Rand Paul, who did secure a coveted high profile speaking slot at the convention. </p> <p>\"Ron Paul sees this as a multi-generational project. He sees his son as the next stage. You don't want to burn bridges,\" said Professor Cary Covington, a political scientist at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>Ron Paul supporters can lay claim to bringing many of their ideas into the Republican mainstream. Bolstered by the Tea Party, Paul's extreme anti-government stance is now virtually Republican orthodoxy. The House of Representatives also recently passed a law to audit the Federal Reserve: a cause Paul was once derided for but that even Romney now backs. </p> <p>But on the other hand the Republican platform in 2012 offers little in Paulite ideas of bringing American troops home from abroad or issues like legalising drugs or raising taxes to stop deficit spending. </p> <p>Repeated efforts this week by Paul delegates to insert language into the platform reflecting such beliefs were voted down by the far greater numbers of Romney delegates.</p> <p>However, that does not bother all Paul supporters. Diaz said the movement of people who have formed around Paul and been swept up in his repeated, if ill-fated, runs for the presidency were committed to taking over the party from the bottom up. </p> <p>Diaz pointed to recent events in Nevada where Paul supporters won control of numerous key offices giving them virtual control over the state party. \"Look at what happened in Nevada. The movement is not going to roll over and die just because Ron Paul is not the candidate any more,\" she said.</p>",
  "<h2>An Amnesty on the fringe</h2> <p>There are plenty who dismiss the fringe as a place where only airhead theatre and shows with jokes are available, but they're wrong. Over my years on the Edinburgh fringe I have discovered a great deal about the world and how it works, not only from international productions but from homegrown work. The <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20290\">Amnesty International Freedom of Expression award</a>, which was presented today (I have been one of the judges), has always recognised that theatre offers a window on the world and can be a catalyst to change. </p> <p>This year's winner, announced at lunchtime today, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/jan/18/two-worlds-charlie-f-veterans\">The Two Worlds of Charlie F</a>, a piece created from the stories of injured soldiers returning from Afghanistan and performed by them. If you missed its brief run in Edinburgh (or when it was in London last January) there will be two final performances at the <a href=\"http://www.trh.co.uk/whatson/the-two-worlds-of-charlie-f/\">Haymarket Theatre</a> in London on 9 September. </p> <p>Charlie F was a worthy winner in a strong shortlist that among others included Grant O'Rourke's very fine one-hour version of Mike Daisey's The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs at Gilded Balloon, a show that will make you see blood welling from the keyboard every time you use a Mac, and Theatre Uncut, the brilliant initiative that responds with speed and eloquence to the ever-changing global financial crisis and public spending cuts. Check out future events <a href=\"http://www.theatreuncut.com/\">here</a> . </p> <p>You're too late to catch 18-year-old Koba Ryckewaert's theatre mindmap, <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/07/all-that-wrong-edinburgh-review\">All That is Wrong</a>, which pointed out that if we are going to change the world, the self is a good place to start, and Peter Arnott's Why Do You Stand There in the Rain, about the first world war veterans who marched on Washington during the Great Depression to demand the bonuses that had been promised to them. But you can still catch the astonishing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/08/mies-julie-edinburgh-review\">Mies Julie</a> at Assembly Mound \u2013 a stark reminder that equality is impossible without justice, and that without justice personal relationships are irrevocably tainted. </p> <h2>Curtain calls</h2> <p>Watching Camille O' Sullivan skip about the stage like a demented pixie at the end of the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk\">Rape of Lucrece</a> last night was rather delightful. Relief was etched upon her face, and her pleasure so evident \u2013 a much more real and human response than the traditional curtain call with its restrained formality. I always think companies coming from abroad must be disappointed by the response of British audiences. In Europe curtain calls can go on almost as long as the play. Apparently when Elfriede Jelinek's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/jul/23/sports-play-review\">Sports Play</a> premiered in mainland Europe, the standing ovation went on for 48 minutes. Although of course the audience might just have been applauding their own survival; Jelinek's is an epic piece.</p> <p>On the fringe, the standing ovation is now pretty well standard, even though everyone knows the truly outstanding shows are few and far between. This practice is now so widespread that you're more likely to notice when it doesn't happen than when it does. It's nice that people want to show their appreciation, but like star-rating inflation, indiscriminate standing ovations only devalues the gesture. If almost every show has a standing ovation, how is it possible for audiences to demonstrate their enthusiasm when they see something that really blows them away?</p> <h2>Two cultures no longer</h2> <p>The appearance of fringe star Camille O'Sullivan in the Edinburgh international festival is another sign of the breakdown of the divisions between the fringe and the international festival. It probably won't be long before standup comedian Daniel Kitson \u2013 who's been appearing at the Traverse for a few years now \u2013 makes his international festival debut.</p> <p>In the previous director Brian McMaster's day, it often felt as if there was outright hostility between the EIF and the fringe, but Jonathan Mills has understood that the two are stronger together, and that all of Edinburgh's festivals benefit from a united approach. The cross-over between fringe and EIF has been strengthened by the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/news/edinburgh-international-festival-fringe-prize-2011-winner-announced \">Fringe prize</a>, awarded each year to an outstanding fringe company and offering development money towards a new piece.

  "<p>They were known by names such as Cocky, Doggy and the Sunderland Kid.

The Newcastle-based archive uploaded 30 of the mugshots to a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/sets/72157631080087096/\" title=\"\">Flickr page</a> that quickly received more than 32,000 views.</p> <p>Carolyn Ball, of Twam, said: \"We knew there was general interest from the public because of the criminal sets [of photographs] <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/sets/72157628700735401/\" title=\"\">we had put on Flickr previously</a>, so we decided to put these ones up as well and they have proved to be just as popular.\" The previous photographic recordsshowed men and women from North Shields during the early 20th century and Victorian villains in Newcastle city gaol in the 1870s.</p> <p>Ball said the archive had received a visit from a descendant of one of those featured in the 1930s set. \"They've been back in today with some information about their ancestor. It was really exciting, this is one of the main reasons we put the photos on to Flickr, because we know so little about these people, and we were hoping we would be contacted.\"</p> <p>She said the visitor was a descendant of <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/7788134068/in/photostream\" title=\"\">John Thomas Hollings</a>, whose transgressions are described in the book as \"larceny, shop, office and warehouse-breaking. Gains access by means of bodily pressure.\" The descendant lives in Newcastle and will work with the archives to produce a more detailed account of Hollings's life.</p> <p>The police identification book is not being exhibited in the museum, partly because it is fragile but also because some of the individuals were born in the last 100 years. \"Another reason why we've used Flickr is that the quality of the pictures is so good, people don't necessarily have to see the physical document to enjoy them,\" Ball said.</p> <p>One of the most interesting individuals recorded was William Jones, whose entry in the book has the words \"died in action\" scrawled across it. The book says he went by the alias Robert Dodds and that his body art featured a pierced heart, a sailor's head and a naked woman. His transgressions included larceny and breaking into houses and shops. He worked alone and held a conviction for shooting a man in America. His end came in Newcastle's Benwell hotel.</p> <p>Another colourful character, James Lowrie, had the nickname the Sunderland Kid, invoking comparisons to the gun-toting frontier outlaw Billy the Kid. The Sunderland Kid, born a decade after the death of his American namesake was a rather smaller-time villain, jailed for larceny and robbery and described as an expert pickpocket.</p>",
  "<h2>Louise Gray for Topshop</h2> <p>Jonathan Saunders, Mary Katrantzou, JW Anderson, Mark Fast\u2026 the list of designers who have lent a creative hand to Topshop clothes over recent years is long and impressive. Now, Scottish designer Louise Gray joins that list with a collection of both clothes and makeup for the high street store. This is the first time since its launch over 12 years ago that Topshop Makeup have done a designer collaborative range, and what an inspired choice to kick things off. On hearing news of the partnership back in May, I predicted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/may/31/beauty-news-summer-pedicure\">\"super bright shades and glittery goods\"</a> and I wasn't far off the mark. Both the clothes and the cosmetics have a playful, punky feel- not exactly for the shy and retiring type. Makeup-wise there's a brilliant blue liquid eyeliner with real staying power, and to describe the two lip shades as \"super bright\" would be something of an understatement. However, nobody's saying you have to wear all 12 products at once (although that might make for an interesting challenge). Taken individually, the products could offer chromophobes a great introduction to bold colours and really punctuate a more toned down look. A sweep of vivid blue across the upper lash line makes a great accent on the eyes no matter what skin or eye colour you may have. The loose glitter pots may be more for the youngsters or party-goers but the three sparkly nail colours are extremely wearable. Sequins feature heavily in the Louise Gray Topshop clothes, so it makes sense to wear the sparkle on your fingers too.<br><em>Eyeliner \u00a38, lip colours \u00a310, and nail varnishes \u00a36.50 all from <a href=\"http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogNavigationSearchResultCmd?catalogId=33057&amp;storeId=12556&amp;langId=-1&amp;viewAllFlag=false&amp;sort_field=Relevance&amp;categoryId=672542&amp;parent_categoryId=208495&amp;beginIndex=1&amp;pageSize=20\">topshop.com</a></em></p> <h2>Short hair revisited</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395108015\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/23/1345719639368/Miley-Cyrus-sports-her-ne-001.jpg\" alt=\"Miley Cyrus sports her new haircut\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miley Cyrus sports her new haircut Photograph: Internet</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Internet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another celebrity cuts their hair, another mild furor fizzles. But this time it all turned a bit sour. Last week, Miley Cyrus showed off a shorter do and it wasn't met with the best reception, with her being compared either to a young boy or a mentally unstable Britney Spears. Neither ideal. Now, I've never paid much, if any, attention to Ms Cyrus' life, but what did catch my attention was the general reaction to short hair on women. Yes, most of these people were on Twitter and Twitter isn't exactly known for being the best social barometer of taste, especially when it comes to the haircuts of an ex-Disney star. But it echoes what myself and many other women in the short hair club experience. In a bar on Saturday evening I was asked (repeatedly) whether I was a lesbian, told I had \"a boyish charm\" and got called Julie Andrews (a new one on me). I don't mind the occasional comment on my hair, and I'm comfortable enough in my own skin (and with my singing abilities) to respond diplomatically. But the assumptions and nicknames can just get a bit tiresome. Your hair does say something about you but it doesn't say the same thing about everyone.</p> <h2>And finally\u2026</h2> <p>Just a little mention for a lovely new foundation from Stila which arrived this week.

  "<p>As a vociferous cheerleader for Nick Clegg in the leadership contest against Chris Huhne, the last two years have been excruciating for me. Given my clear position on the left of the party, many wondered at my support. But I had worked with Clegg on our crime policy, I knew he was sound on issues of civil liberties, had an enlightened evidence-based approach to crime and punishment, was committed to improving the life chances of all our children and was undoubtedly a true liberal. On the issues we disagreed on he was still willing to listen, so I had reasoned that he would be a pragmatic leader, recognising that he and the party weren't always on the same page, that he didn't always share the social liberal mainstream view, but that he would accept the democratic nature of our party and go along with us.</p> <p>Having been a member of the federal policy committee, which he chaired, I saw that this did in fact happen. He would argue his case, often passionately, but once a decision was made would own it publicly even if it wasn't his personal view. So, I was not surprised when he took on the role of deputy prime minister in a Conservative-led coalition with such aplomb. I have no doubt he would have done the same in a coalition with Labour.</p> <p>As one of only four to speak against the coalition at our special conference in May 2010, like many in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/09/liberal-left-clegg-cameron-liberal-democrats\" title=\"\">Liberal Left</a>, my opposition has been unwavering. For others, whose starry-eyed excitement at the prospect of being in government was clear at the time, the shiny stuff began to wear off before long. For some it began with our apparent betrayal on tuition fees, for some it was the NHS, for others welfare and legal aid changes. For yet others, Lords reform has proven to be the final straw. The man who promised to do politics differently, the leader of the party with a manifesto commitment to \"clean up politics\" suddenly became tarnished by the constant tinkle of apparently broken promises. And his foot soldiers, uncomfortably, became tarnished by association.</p> <p>So the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/half-lib-dems-nick-clegg-resign?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Liberal Democrat Voice (LDV) poll</a> suggesting that half of Lib Dem party members want Clegg to resign before the election shouldn't come as a surprise, and Clegg's office oughtn't to be so quick to dismiss it as \"unrepresentative\", especially as LDV generally tends to be slightly more reflective of the right of the party. My concern, though, is that while focusing on one person we must not neglect the elephant in the room, namely the disastrous Tory-led approach to the economy.</p> <p>Maybe it's not too late for Clegg to turn this around. Maybe an apology or mea culpa over tuition fees, NHS, welfare, legal aid, employment law reforms would suffice. Maybe an admission that they've got it wrong on the economy and a return to the promise in our manifesto regarding deficit reduction, namely \"we must ensure timing is right. If spending is cut too soon it will undermine the much needed recovery and cost jobs\".</p> <p>But I fear that Clegg is trapped, being seen as all too comfortable with the Tories and willing to adopt their mantras, even on issues of civil liberties. So perhaps the solution is to separate the role of deputy prime minister and party leader (something not unheard of in British politics) and allow a new leader to reaffirm who we are as a party and what we stand for. If Clegg and the party were to accept that as a way forward it would avoid a bloody leadership battle, and give the activists some hope that the rumours of our imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated.</p>",

Listen here<br></a><br><strong>Hometown:</strong> Brooklyn.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Taraka and Nimai Larson.</p> <p><strong>The background: </strong>Prince Rama have just made the greatest album in the history of recorded sound. In their minds. The PR that accompanies their new album, Top Ten Hits of the End of the World, promises that the Larson sisters have made a record comprising \"an expanded palette of genre tags\" including, among others, \"cosmic disco, motorcycle rock, new wave grunge, tribal goth, Arabic pop and ghost-modern glam\". Wow and indeed ee. Would that or would that not make it the greatest album in the history of recorded sound? The idea of a band even vaguely attempting to approximate the sound of groups as wildly disparate as, well, whoever you consider to be the leading exponents of cosmic disco, motorcycle rock, new wave grunge etc, is enough to make us want to use the phrase \"wow and indeed ee\" in public. We don't even know what \"new wave grunge\" is, but in the context of an album that would also involve cosmic disco and ghost-modern glam, who cares? Ghost-modern glam! What a tantalising appellation, suggestive of a chillwave <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmCIe2VEOtE\" title=\"\">Ballroom Blitz</a>. We can't wait to hear that. And there would still be another nine tracks to go.</p> <p>Why 10 tracks in total, you ask? Because the album \"channels the ghost of 10 different pop bands that died during the apocalypse\". Ok-aaay. Apparently there has been an apocalypse. We'll let that pass for now. We're also told the album is being issued on Animal Collective's Paw Tracks imprint and that production, tracking and mixing has been courtesy of people who have worked with Animal Collective, in a studio used by Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti. This project couldn't whet our appetite any more if you told us Todd Rundgren and Tyler, the Creator had provided wind chimes and handclaps.</p> <p>Then we played Top Ten Hits, this \"pseudo-compilation album\" and \"retrospective requiem of all pop albums ever made\" featuring 10 fictional bands, and guess what? It wasn't quite the magnificent game-changing auricular spectacular we were expecting. The line in the press release declaring that \"nothing like this has ever been attempted by a single band\" isn't strictly true because they haven't really attempted it at all. Top Ten Hits isn't cosmic disco followed by ghost-modern glam \u2013 it's just 10 variations on a theme, and the theme is psychedelic indie drone-rock of a vaguely C86-ish bent, with liberal sprinklings of raga texture and Hindu atmosphere as befits a couple of girls raised on a Hare Krishna commune in Florida.</p> <p>You can sort of tell, listening to their music, that Taraka and Nimai Larson have \"lived at ashrams and worked for utopian architects\", if not that they've \"delivered lectures from pools of fake blood and conducted group exorcisms scored by old VHS workouts\". We're still not sure why they think there's been an apocalypse. But they obviously move in arcane circles where esoteric ideas are routinely promulgated. But Ten Songs doesn't sound particularly post-apocalyptic. It's less sinister than simply \u2026 similar, and as we say, not quite the feast of rampant eclecticism proposed by the PR. It's by no means bad or unpleasant, just average indie, some of it more rhythmic than others but none deserving of the designation disco, let alone cosmic. And as for ghost-modern glam, maybe someone else can have a crack at that one. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/19/ariel-pink-mature-themes-interview\" title=\"\">Ariel</a>?</p> <p><strong>The buzz: </strong>\"I saw Prince Rama at a DIY show at SXSW and they blew me away\" \u2013 Animal Collective's Avey Tare.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Let-down of the week.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Lose their raga when they read this.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Form a side project called Raga Against the Machine.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Top Ten Hits of the End of the World is released by Paw Tracks on 5 November.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Shonen Knife, Kula Shaker, Talulah Gosh, Blondie.</p> <p><strong>Links: </strong><a href=\"http://princerama.tumblr.com\" title=\"\">princerama.tumblr.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Friday's new band:</strong> Zebra Katz.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Title: </strong>Frankie Boyle - Live</p> <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2008</p> <p><strong>The setup:</strong> Frankie Boyle takes comedy about as low as it can go. His baiting of taboos is not the problem \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/heard-one-about-rape-funny-now\" title=\"\">jokes about rape</a>, cancer, paedophilia and so forth are now as commonplace as the ones about Irishmen and mothers-in-law used to be. The problem, rather, is that Boyle gets personal.</p> <p>This show, his first live DVD, includes jokes about Lewis Hamilton's brother having cerebral palsy, the children's television presenter Mark Speight killing himself, and the schoolgirl <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/shannon-matthews-kidnap\" title=\"\">Shannon Matthews being kidnapped and imprisoned.</a> \"The ugly ones always turn up alive,\" is his remark on that. You may be appalled, or you might laugh. Both emotions are visible in the crowd, and you can some people's faces wrestling with them too. What's interesting is that there's an audience at all.</p> <p>Boyle does not actually mock affliction; he just never cuts it any slack. Where honesty is concerned, he is a fundamentalist, sparing no one his opinions. In 2008, he was widely scolded for describing the pleasant young swimmer Rebecca Adlington as \"like someone who's looking at themselves in the back of a spoon\". The comment hurt her, but \u2013 impressively \u2013 she now says it was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8575567/Rebecca-Adlington-Im-over-the-Frankie-Boyle-spoon-jibe.html\" title=\"\">hypocritical to complain when she herself has laughed at similar jokes about others</a>.</p> <p>This is the nub of things. Is it Boyle's cruelty that disgusts people, or his straying from the list of acceptable victims? If compassion were the issue, wouldn't we be just as outraged by the years of abuse directed by all sorts of people at Camilla Parker-Bowles? (\"What Diana would have looked like if she'd survived the accident,\" is Boyle's contribution there.) The truth, of course, is that we are hypocrites as well. In private, many of us make jokes like Boyle's all the time. And they are acceptable in public too, as long as the target isn't liked.</p> <p><strong>Funny how?</strong> He'd probably disdain the word, but Boyle is, above all else, a wit. Very little fresh observation goes on in his comedy, and not much actual joke-telling either \u2013 which is where he differs, say, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/series/leo-benedictus-comedy-gold+culture/jimmy-carr\" title=\"\">Jimmy Carr</a>. What Boyle purveys, for all the machismo of his Glaswegian bluster, are exquisitely phrased little aper\u00e7us.</p> <p>On pets: \"Having a pet is basically just saying, 'I have tried to find love among my own species.'\" On John Prescott: \"John Prescott is so fat that he can't wear a belt and a tie on the same day or he'll turn into sausages.\" On Nick Clegg, in Boyle's superbly written but poorly made sketch show, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/dec/01/frankie-boyle-tramadol-nights\" title=\"\">Tramadol Nights</a>: \"a guy who looks like he shouts out 'sorry' when he comes.\"</p> <p>Like most wits, Boyle works best when he is being (or appearing to be) spontaneous. Accordingly, there is a lot of back-and-forth with the audience in this show. Well, there's a lot of forth, anyway. Often, there is only silent cowering where the back should be. At one point he calls a stockbroker an \"evil cunt\" before asking sweetly, \"Do you ever think of getting a gun and blowing your own head off?\" That's Boyle's way. But if he can make you laugh then perhaps he's no nastier than you are.</p> <p><strong>Comic cousins:</strong> Bill Hicks, Jimmy Carr, Doug Stanhope.</p> <p><strong>Steal this:</strong> \"There are some old fuckers in tonight. A sign that it's been a mild winter.\"</p>",

  "<p>A sheriff in Kirkcaldy has asked for mental health checks on Stephen Gough after the naked rambler broke down in court.</p> <p>Gough, 53, from Eastleigh, Hampshire, has spent nearly all of the last six years in Scottish jails, including long periods in solitary confinement at Perth prison, after repeatedly being arrested for failing to wear clothes in public or in court.</p> <p>He was nude again at Kirkcaldy sheriff court on Thursday to face another charge of breach of the peace after his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/20/naked-rambler-arrested-prison\" title=\"\">arrest</a> on the outskirts of Dunfermline in July, three days after his release from his last term of imprisonment at Perth.</p> <p>During the final stages of a two-hour hearing at which Gough represented himself, the former soldier broke down in tears as he made closing remarks in his own defence.</p> <p>He had been agitated and seemed near to breaking down earlier in the hearing, prompting the sheriff, James Williamson, to order criminal social work reports into Gough's mental wellbeing before sentencing. Gough told the court he had last had psychiatric tests or social work evaluation several years ago.</p> <p>In his emotional final plea, Gough, heavily bearded and gaunt, referred to allegations made by the prosecutor, Brian Robertson, and complaints from two civilian witnesses about the alleged impact on their children of seeing him walking naked through Townhill, near Dunfermline.</p> <p>His voice breaking before he began audibly sobbing, Gough said: \"There's nothing about me as a human being that is indecent or alarming or offensive. That's where I'm coming from, which is deep inside.</p> <p>\"So this provocative nature that the man [Robertson] is suggesting I have is nothing of the kind. It's me, standing up for what I am. [Because] all of us are human beings too and we have children and our children are beautiful and we're beautiful too, because we're human beings \u2013 all the same. I have nothing to be ashamed about. I'm just a bloke standing up for the truth of what I am.\"</p> <p>Williamson told him: \"There were certain points in your evidence and certain points in your summing up where I was concerned about your emotional behaviour, and I was a bit concerned as to whether or not you were in control of yourself. I want somebody independent to see whether your mental health is all that is should be because, in the absence of any good reason otherwise, you're going to end up serving prison sentence after prison sentence.\"</p> <p>Gough was arrested by Fife police about 300 metres from a children's play area on Friday 20 July after several 999 calls were made from residents complaining that a naked man with a rucksack had been walking through Townhill, worrying and upsetting their children.</p> <p>One prosecution witness, Michelle Solway, who said her 10-year-old daughter had been allegedly shocked by seeing him naked on the roadside, refused to look at Gough as he sat in the dock, answering his questions by staring fixedly at the floor, her arms clasped across her chest.</p> <p>Gough, who achieved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2012/jul/18/why-happy-naked-rambler-free\" title=\"\">fame</a> and some notoriety for twice walking from John O'Groats in the far north of Scotland to Land's End in Cornwall, had already walked for two days from Perth after leaving prison in the nude. He has refused to abandon his goal of walking naked back to Southampton, on the south coast of England.</p>",
  "<h2>A PADDY MINEFIELD</h2> <p>So Paddy Kenny has apparently been caught sending abusive text messages to QPR owner Tony Fernandes and technical director Mike Rigg. Naughty Paddy! Naughty football! You wouldn't catch other sports making such a sorry show of itself in such a cack-handed way. It seems the big-boned Nasty Leeds goalkeeper hasn't taken too kindly to being replaced at Loftus Road by Robert Green this summer and, ever the consummate professional, spent Saturday evening and the early hours of Sunday morning acting like a jilted lover by badgering Fernandes and Rigg with insults about Green and QPR's 5-0 shellacking by Swansea City. There were also calls for Rigg until 3am in the morning. Kenny is 34 years old.</p> <p>Truly hell hath no fury like an average goalkeeper scorned for opting for the Neil Ruddock steak-and-chips-and-sausages-and-bacon-and-eggs diet and throwing one into his own net during a make-or-break relegation decider. Rigg's response has been to act like Hans Blix in Team America and send a formal letter of complaint to Nasty Leeds, stressing that he is \"very, very angry\". A letter when he could have sent a tweet? Later on, granddad! For their part, Nasty Leeds don't seem too fussed. \"We have a club policy on Twitter and social networking. It's an internal matter and we will not be commenting further,\" said Neil Warnock, who was sacked by QPR in January.</p> <p>Kenny's actions do seem to have had some sort of effect on QPR though, with Green's Rustenberg-esque display against Swansea prompting them to go in for Inter's Julio Cesar, who could become their 453rd signing of the summer. Fernandes insists there's no reason to worry about finances though. \"I think people out there think we are just throwing money and panic buying, all these kinds of words I hear,\" he said, before saying nothing much at all about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzbn0yR2A-w\" title=\"\">Joey Joe Joe Junior Shabadoo Barton's</a> potential move to Marseille. Yet with Mark Hughes seemingly focusing on a team that could become extremely competitive in around five years ago, it may not be long before they have to change the club's name to QPLOL.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"I want people to really cheer in the stadium, swear, mourn, to lie in each other's arms or father children in the stands.

  "<p>A year ago this week, the Syrian National Council was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/23/syrian-opposition-national-council\" title=\"\">formed in Istanbul</a> by a coalition of political forces and figures that presented themselves as society's representatives. In the absence of a mechanism to determine the power base of each political force, the Muslim Brotherhood came to dominate the council, benefiting from its relations with Islamist-leaning Turkey.</p> <p>The Brotherhood's perceived monopoly over the council has led to a chronic political stalemate within the opposition and will most likely undermine an orderly transition if the situation persists. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/un-finds-new-syria-mediator\" title=\"\">the appointment of Algerian veteran diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi</a> as the new UN-Arab League envoy to Syria, along with the recent defections of high-level technocrats, presents a new opportunity to reverse the group's domination.</p> <p>Brahimi is unlikely to succeed where his predecessor Kofi Annan failed in terms of ending the violence, but he can secure a political settlement and mediate a representative, inclusive political body that will help to avert chaos in the wake of the regime's downfall.</p> <p>It is difficult to precisely gauge the Brotherhood's power base inside Syria, as the organisation has been banned since 1963. But past experience, when the Brotherhood was part of the country's political system for more than a decade, and well-established social dynamics offer useful insights.</p> <p>Moulhem Droubi, a senior member of the Brotherhood, has said the organisation represents 25% of the Syrian population. That is certainly disputable. In the 1949 parliamentary election, the movement won around 2.5% of the vote and in subsequent elections never rose above 6%.</p> <p>At the time, the Brotherhood was viewed largely as a moderate organisation that preached more about socialism than religion, though it later started to alienate minorities. In 1950, it successfully campaigned to amend the constitution to make Islam the religion of the state and the president.</p> <p>With the ascension of the Ba'ath party and its totalitarian rule in the 60s, the Brotherhood turned violent, splintered and formed militias that would later target civilians and military officers along sectarian lines in the 70s and 80s. Its power base has since dwindled significantly after four decades of systematic cleansing by the Ba'athist regime.</p> <p>Activists from various parts of Syria have told me that, prior to the uprising last year, the country had almost zero Brotherhood presence. The organisation's presence then started to return in some areas, particularly in Homs, Hama and Idlib.</p> <p>Salama Kayla, a Christian Palestinian-Syrian who was recently deported by the regime for his role in the uprising, said he had visited several protest spots, including in Homs and Hama, in the early months of the uprising.</p> <p>He said there were \"negligible groups\" of Brotherhood members with the protests in few areas. He said that activists in Hama complained that a small Brotherhood-affiliated group was pushing for \"violent conflict\". It was surprising, he said, that the Brotherhood had such a small presence in a city widely considered as its stronghold.</p> <p>\"I am a middle-class Halabi [from Aleppo] and everyone I knew hated them,\" one activist told me. \"The only time I ever met an MB member is during an embassy protest outside Syria. They seem to be more popular among exiles.\"</p> <p>A senior member of the SNC who is close to the Brotherhood told me the organisation tends to believe that any person who receives aid through the group is expected to support it electorally in the future.</p> <p>Even if the Brotherhood succeeds in establishing a palpable presence, its influence is likely to be limited to certain areas. At least seven out of 14 provinces will be outside the Brotherhood's sphere of influence for the foreseeable future: Hasaka, Raqqa, Deir ez-Zor and Deraa (tribal and Kurdish areas that make up over 30% of the population, loyal to their local leaders), Suweida (the Druze stronghold, nearly 2% of the population) and the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus (where Alawites, Ismailis and other minorities are based and make up nearly 8.5% of the population).</p> <p>Demographically, non-Sunnis form 30% of the population and Sunni Kurds make up 9%. These bases of ethnic and religious minorities, plus the tribes \u2013 altogether making up at least 70% of the population \u2013 had been outside the group's influence in the past and will remain so in the future.</p> <p>When the Brotherhood was part of the political system, the business community in both Aleppo and Damascus allied itself with the People's party, a nationalist non-Islamist party, and then to the Ba'ath party. Politically, the business community today is also more likely to ally itself with non-Islamist groups.</p> <p>Also, in both of these significant cities, the business community is socially tied with a local pragmatic clergy that adheres to a classical Sunni religious school similar to that of al-Azhar in Egypt.</p> <p>The Brotherhood realises the limits of its power and seeks to establish levers of influence during the uprising and in the transition period. According to different accounts, the Brotherhood is using its control over the two key offices within the SNC, the aid and military offices, to establish leverage in certain areas and among the Free Syrian Army.</p> <p>The group has formed its own brigades under the so-called Body of Civilians Protection, naming some of the brigades after the Brotherhood's historical leaders. According to one informed source, the group has additionally about 13 brigades operating in Hama, known as Abulfidaa brigades.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the country appears set for a war that will continue until the regime falls. Significant segments of society in Syria are torn between a despotic regime that is committing atrocities on a daily basis and a stagnant political opposition that has so far failed to present a viable alternative and is dominated by a group they view suspiciously. That is a torn majority, not a silent majority.</p>",
  "<p>Think of Patricia Arquette and you very likely think of her role as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wAQ4zHy_AQ\" title=\"kickass callgirl Alabama\">kickass callgirl Alabama</a> in the 90s cult classic <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108399/\" title=\"True Romance\">True Romance</a> \u2013 directed, of course, by the mighty Tony Scott, who died last weekend. Since 2005, though, Arquette has been quietly starring in underrated supernatural police procedural <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7qV0V6fXJQ\" title=\"Medium\">Medium</a>.</p> <p>Arquette's character <a href=\"http://www.allisondubois.com/\" title=\"Allison DuBois\">Allison DuBois</a> is a psychic medium working for the district attorney in Phoenix, Arizona. She dreams about crimes, sometimes before they have happened, gets given clues by ghosts, can talk to dead people \u2013 and eventually persuades the authorities to use her abilities to their advantage. Which all sounds pretty preposterous, until you realise it is based on a real-life Allison DuBois, a \"psychic profiler\" who really did work in law enforcement and serves as consultant on the show. Writer <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139111/\" title=\"Glenn Gordon Caron\">Glenn Gordon Caron</a>, who also created <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QTVtAsVrEg\" title=\"Moonlighting\">Moonlighting</a>, based Medium on the real Dubois' memoirs.</p> <p>One of Medium's major strengths is the way it contrasts ghostly investigations into often grisly cases with Allison's altogether more normal home life. Jake Weber (an Andrew Graham-Dixon/Edwin Van Der Sar lookalike whose dad was a drug dealer for the Rolling Stones in the early 70s) plays her husband Joe \u2013 a sardonic, slightly baffled engineer who never seems to get a full night's sleep because his wife's always shaking him awake by the shoulder to tell him about her latest gruesome dream. Arquette and Weber make a convincing couple. Accomplished child actors play their three daughters, who turn out to have inherited their mother's ability; as the girls discover when they hit puberty, the gift can also be a curse.

  "<p>When US army reservist Farhaj Hassan heard news of a shooting at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, his first instinct was to email three mosques in his home town of Newark. \"I wanted to check on them to ask if they have strong relationships with the local police.\" Hassan, 35, said, at a recent meeting with the Guardian there.</p> <p>\"Work with the cops. Work with the cops. That has always been my belief,\" Hassan said. \"A two-way dialogue is necessary for everyone's security.\"</p> <p>That belief is one of the factors that has motivated Hassan, along with seven other individuals and organisations, to file a lawsuit against the NYPD's covert program of surveillance in American Muslim communities.</p> <p>It is now a year since a Pulitzer Prize-winning<a href=\"http://www.ap.org/Index/AP-In-The-News/NYPD\"> investigative series by the Associated Press</a> blew the cover off the secret program by NYPD's little-known demographics unit in New York and three surrounding states, that began in early 2002.</p> <p>The reports showed the deep and pervasive extent of the program, with the NYPD singling out and tracking American Muslim communities in New York City, Newark and other areas. Mosques, shops, restaurants and even student associations were targeted by surveillance activity on a scale that left many calling the program discriminatory and tantamount to racial profiling. Throughout the past year however, New York City authorities including the NYPD and mayor Michael Bloomberg have steadfastly defended the measures, deeming them necessary to keep New Yorkers safe from terrorist attacks \u2013 even though this week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/21/nypd-secret-muslim-spying-no-leads?newsfeed=true\">it was revealed that the program had netted no arrests</a>, nor even a single lead, in six years.</p> <p>A year on, the public knows little about the full scope of the program and in which areas it is carried out. The NYPD's chief spokesman, deputy commissioner Paul Browne, would not respond to questions from the Guardian, sent to him more than a week ago. Several Muslim organisations have accused the NYPD of treating community concerns over the past year with \"a wall of silence\". New Jersey congressman Rush Holt, an outspoken critic of the program, told the Guardian he found NYPD's conduct \"completely unapologetic and shameless\".</p> <p>Omar Bajwa, the Muslim chaplain at Yale University, whose Muslim Students' Association was spied on by NYPD, says the department's nonchalance to questions from the community is \"incredibly arrogant\". The NYPD's methods and manner were alienating \"future leaders\", he said. \"They need to apologize to the Muslim community, make an honest disclosure of facts, and seek advice on how they should reform their intelligence program.\"</p> <h2>'There is a serious effort to look into this'</h2> <p>While several elected politicians, including in Hassan's home state of New Jersey, have criticised the NYPD's program, few have successfully challenged it. Newark's Democratic mayor, Cory Booker, reiterated his opposition, telling the Guardian in a statement: \"These activities deeply disturbed me. The only provocation for this surveillance was religious belief, which strikes against some of my fundamental ideals as an American. I still hold these positions.\" But Booker did not respond to questions about whether the program was continuing in his jurisdiction, and if he had raised his concerns directly with the NYPD. </p> <p>Last September, Holt, who served as chairman of the House permanent select committee on intelligence from 2007 to 2010, wrote to US attorney general Eric Holder, asking the department of justice to investigate NYPD's program. Holt said he has followed up on his letter with phone calls and emails through the past year. \"But I have got no indication that there is a serious effort to look into this, which does not reflect well on the department of justice.\"</p> <p>It is this nonchalance from the NYPD as well as authorities with powers of oversight, say Hassan and his lawyer, Glenn Katon from the California-based body Muslim Advocates, which made filing a lawsuit unavoidable. </p> <p>Hassan joined the US army a few days before 9/11. \"I grew up watching Mash on TV and wanted to serve \u2026 I was looking for that sense of camaraderie.\" He was deployed to Iraq from 2003 to 2004, where he served in military intelligence. He was at home in Newark last August when the AP broke the story.</p> <p>His first reaction was shock at how deep the program went. When he subsequently learned that police had watched the mosques and establishments in Newark he frequented with his mother, he was struck by how misplaced the NYPD program seemed. \"If they really knew who the congregants were they would know these people have other things to worry about \u2013 earning their living, getting by, giving their kids a decent education \u2026 Committing heinous acts against the US is the last thing on their mind,\" Hassan said.</p> <p>Hassan, currently a graduate student and a reservist who spends a weekend every month drilling with his unit at a military base in Bristol, says what makes him most uncomfortable is that \"law-abiding Muslims who are going about their daily life, doing deeply private and constitutionally guaranteed activities such as praying should be suspected merely because they are Muslims\".</p> <h2>Are the AP's findings 'just the tip of the iceberg'?</h2> <p>Katon says his plaintiffs, who include the council of imams in New Jersey, have noted a fall in number of devotees coming to pray after learning that their places of worship featured on NYPD lists. Small businesses featured in NYPD documents have also noticed a decline in customers, Katon said. \"Perfumes and lotions are not specific to the Muslim community, and our plaintiffs have had customers calling up and saying: 'I saw a report in the newspaper and I am not comfortable coming to your shop any more.'\"</p> <p>While the lawsuit challenges the program's operation in New Jersey, any court ruling would have wider geographical effects. Two New York-based organisations \u2013 the American Civil Liberties Union and the Council for American-Islamic Relations \u2013 also told the Guardian they were considering legal remedies, among other measures, in an attempt to force the NYPD to end its surveillance program.</p> <p>Hassan says: \"We do not know if the public criticism has altered, increased or decreased NYPD's spying on Muslims. I fear that what the AP reports revealed might just be the tip of the iceberg.\"<br> The emotional impact of knowing one is under surveillance while going about one's day-to-day life is harder to see or measure. Every American Muslim the Guardian interviewed for this report used strong words \u2013 'a sense of chill', 'dread', 'public trauma', 'deep worry', 'severe mistrust' \u2013 to describe how they still felt about NYPD's program. </p> <p>Congressman Holt said: \"The sense of siege American Muslims experienced in the aftermath of 9/11 had just started to lift about two years ago, when the news of NYPD's secret program reinstated it all over again.\" </p> <p>When asked how knowing they were being spied on by the NYPD affected his wards, Yale's Muslim chaplain Bajwa said: \"I know of students who have felt embarrassed or a lowering of self-esteem. Some stopped participating in group activities and felt conscious about being publicly Muslim.\" He added: \"I do not want to exaggerate the effect, but female Muslim students in particular have grown more reticent, including not speaking up in class, to not draw any attention to themselves.\" </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395122567\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345652804518/nypd-mosque-brooklyn-010.jpg\" alt=\"nypd mosque brooklyn\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imam Khalil Abdur-Rashid leads prayers at his mosque in Brooklyn.

We can do that only if we are confident to speak out,\" Khan said in a recent interview at Asma's office on Manhattan's Upper West Side. </p> <p>The eight-member council, which met for the first time this July, was set up for Bloomberg and Kelly to hear from representatives of Muslim communities. Khan says its establishment is an acknowledgement by the authorities that they have made mistakes. It is also an opening that the community must seize, she argued. \"It is important that in the eyes of the public we are not seen as a community in opposition with law enforcement authorities, and so we must engage.\"</p> <p>Imam Khalil Abdur-Rashid, the imam at Brooklyn's Iqra mosque and another member of the council, said he was willing to be a part of this dialogue with the NYPD as long as \"it does not seem like a token gesture from the authorities\". Deeply critical of the surveillance program \u2013 he dubbed it \"not public safety, but public trauma in the lives of law-abiding citizens\" \u2013 Rashid said that efforts like the lawsuit were also needed since multiple ways of approaching the issue would make the effort to end such discriminatory policies more effective. </p> <p>According to Khan, the council will get involved in a range of efforts, from organising town hall meetings between city authorities and New York's Muslim communities to vetting material for police trainings, and countering the theological arguments of religious extremists. </p> <p>But for now, there is little public acknowledgement from the NYPD or city authorities that its surveillance program, as it exists in its current form, needs to be altered or ended. </p> <p>Holt's great worry is that the program, by singling out one religious minority, might be actually making Americans less, not more, safe. He: \"In this era of decentralised terror, if you alienate an entire community, you are unlikely to get their co-operation in intelligence gathering.\" </p> <p>\"As I see it\", Holt said, \"profiling is a substitute for thinking.\"</p> <p>Hassan said he had just one question for those who supported NYPD's surveillance program: \"If we say okay to this now, then what will we see next?\"</p>",
  "<p>Being a comedy judge (just, I suppose, like being a judge in real life) requires you to follow rules. A real judge cannot let someone off a complex fraud charge just because they smell nice. A comedy judge, meanwhile, can neither give a performer a prize for their bodily odour, nor do so if their show is less than 50 minutes long. Or if they regularly sell more than 500 tickets for a gig. Or have their own TV show. <a href=\"http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/judging.asp\" title=\"\">It's complicated</a>.</p> <p>These restrictions mean that, while you might feel you've seen every single comedy show under the sun (and those of other constellations too), there are some performers who don't get on your schedule. However, in recent days I have been fortunate enough to have seen both <a href=\"http://www.danielkitson.com/danmailinglist.html\" title=\"\">Daniel Kitson</a> (ineligible: previous prizewinner) and <a href=\"http://simonmunnery.com/\" title=\"\">Simon Munnery</a> (ineligible: had his own TV show once). They both provided a nice counterpoint to much of what I'd been seeing elsewhere.</p> <p>What I noticed most about Munnery's show, Fylm-Makker, and Kitson's, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/14/kitson-show-no-title-review\" title=\"\">As of 1.52pm GMT on Friday April 27th 2012, This Show Has No Title</a>, was a difference in pace. Both shows were slower. Much slower. Most fringe comedy goes off at a rattle, eager to get the audience onside and probably just as scared of losing them. Kitson and Munnery do not.</p> <p>This is surely an active choice, explained by any number of technical reasons related to timing and structure, but it also conveyed confidence. At 35 and 45, Kitson and Munnery are experienced performers. They know what they're doing. They're not frightened that a moment's silence or hesitation might blow the whole show. In both men, this translated itself as calm, something that conveyed itself to the audience. I felt relaxed watching both performers; it made for a different viewing experience.</p> <p>Kitson's show, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/14/kitson-show-no-title-review\" title=\"\">As of \u2026 </a>, at the Traverse theatre, is his now customary blend of comedy and theatre, a narrative about a man who never owns anything for more than 24 hours, told in three different ways (each with their own conversational asides and meanderings). Munnery's show is a showcase for a new form of comedic technology; \"Fylm Makking\", in which the comedian sits in the middle of the crowd projecting his face (among other things) onto a screen on the stage. Sometimes it can take a while for the next part of the show to pop up. Sometimes it does pop up only to be the wrong thing.</p> <p>Kitson's wanderings are pre-determined (despite the dishevellment of the narrator, every last second appears meticulously planned) while Munnery's might well be different each day. But both performers do it intentionally. The effect on the audience is to make you feel as if you're part of some small club, and have been allowed access to the secret workings and fumblings of the performer \u2013 to what they're really like.</p> <p>Coincidentally, I found, it also removes the pressure to laugh, and this is a great aid to laughter. It happens so often in Edinburgh, when things are at stake \u2013 either in the performer's career or in the audience's desire to get value for money \u2013 that there's an uneasy feeling. The performer is anxious that the show isn't going as well as planned (let's face it, compared with the ideal in the comic's mind, it rarely is). The audience, meanwhile, are forcing themselves to engage, which is awkward. Quite often, everything is so geared to the maximum level of entertainment per minute that what results is quite far from it.</p> <p>Munnery and Kitson seem to be able to coax laughter from their audiences without even trying. Of course, this is partly to do with the enthusiastic \u2013 some might say over-enthusiastic \u2013 following they have built. But really, it's because they're in control of their craft to the extent that they allow themselves to be relaxed. They're chilled-out entertainers. Others could learn from that, too.</p>",

The second of four daughters, she lived with her mother Virginia in the Spanish Lake neighbourhood of St Louis, about two miles from the bridge. Julie was a volunteer for Amnesty International and Greenpeace, and her family and friends admired her for her strong sense of justice. She had a motto hanging on her bedroom wall: \u201cWho says you can't change the world?\u201d Her mother Ginna told police on the night of the incident: \u201cJulie is a very friendly, trusting and idealistic girl\u201d.</p> <p>Julie's overwhelming enthusiasm was for writing poetry and songs. As her cousin, Jeanine Cummins, puts it in her book about the tragedy, A Rip in Heaven: \u201cJulie was having a full-blown love affair with words. Her poetry was her passion; it helped her to interpret her life, to put things in perspective.\u201d It was poetry that brought Julie and her sister to the bridge that night \u2013 they wanted to show their cousin, Thomas Cummins, a poem Julie had written and that they'd painted on the bridge.</p> <p>Julie's body was found three weeks after she went missing, near Caruthersville, 297 miles downstream. She is buried in Calvary cemetery in St Louis.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-robin-kerry\"> <h2>Robin Kerry</h2> <p>A year younger than her sister Julie, Robin, 19 at the time of her death, was also studying at the University of Missouri-St Louis, in her case linguistics. She was active in the local community, helping six-year-olds with their homework after school at the local Salvation Army family haven. A strict vegetarian, her bedroom was festooned with sculptures she had made and sketches of dragons and fairies.</p> <p>Her cousin Jeanine Cummins wrote that \u201cRobin was bright and defiant. Julie was her mentor, her muse, but Robin was one hundred per cent her own person. She was the shier of the two sisters, but her quiet demeanor masked an ever active wellspring of activity in the mind. She was witty, sarcastic and passionate.\u201d The sisters' mother, Ginna, told police on the night they went missing that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366824-22-police-record-91063187.html#document/p14/a59323\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cif there was a struggle, Robin would defend herself and sister and would fight to the death\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Robin's body has never been found.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-thomas-cummins\"> <h2>Thomas Cummins</h2> <p>The son of a Catholic deacon from Gaithersburg, Maryland, Tom Cummins was training to become a fire fighter when the Chain of Rocks tragedy occurred. Aged 19, he had travelled with his family to St Louis for the spring break to spend time with his cousin Julie. On the night of the 4 April he drove with Julie and her sister Robin to the bridge to see a poem that Julie had written and painted on it. After the women fell to their deaths, Cummins became the star witness in the prosecution case against Reggie Clemons and his two other black co-defendants. He testified in three separate trials that they had raped his cousins and pushed them into the river, then forced him to jump after them by threatening to shoot him.</p> <p>But police initially <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59316\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">considered Cummins the murderer</a>. Police records suggested that when they first encountered Cummins after he had sounded the alarm they were <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366824-22-police-record-91063187.html#document/p1/a59324\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">puzzled by his dry and neatly combed hair</a>. Records also show that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p7/a58722\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">when he was questioned by detectives he changed his story several times</a>, at one point saying that Julie had stumbled into the river after he had unwittingly startled her by trying to hug her.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59317\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Police dropped their investigation of Cummins</a> after they corroborated his statement that four other men had been on the bridge that night.

He had moved to the small town of Wentzville outside St Louis just three weeks before the incident, where he became friendly with Marlin Gray.</p> <p>At just 5 ft 6 inches, he was described as an awkward teenager, though polite and respectful. He was arrested having been implicated by Thomas Cummins as one of the four perpetrators. After interrogation, he agreed to turn prosecution witness, confessing that he had been involved in robbing Cummins and the sisters and had held down the women but had not raped them. He gave evidence in court in the three separate trials of his co-defendants in exchange for a lesser charge of second-degree murder for which he pleaded guilty and received a 30-year sentence.</p> <p>Winfrey was a key witness for the prosecution whose testimony was crucial to the conviction of Reggie Clemons, testifying he had seen Clemons rape the sisters. By his own account, though, he was not on the bridge at the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p8/a58723\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">moment the Kerry sisters fell into the river</a>.

He now lives outside St Louis with his mother. When the Guardian visited him, he said: \u201cI have nothing to say. Talk to my lawyer.\u201d</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-marlin-gray\"> <h2>Marlin Gray</h2> <p>Marlin Gray, 23 at the time, was the oldest of the four men accused of murdering the Kerry sisters. On the evening of 4 April he was driving around Wentzville when he spotted Daniel Winfrey who he had got to know shortly before, and the two of them went off to visit Gray's friend Reggie Clemons in St Louis.</p> <p>After the four were arrested, Winfrey told police that Gray had had the initial idea to go back on the bridge and accost the Kerry sisters and their cousin, alleging that Gray had said he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p12/a58904\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cfelt like hurting someone\u201d</a>. Gray also made a confession to police, but shortly afterwards retracted it, saying <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365270-8-marlin-gray-clemency.html#document/p5/a59282\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">it had been beaten out of him</a>. Winfrey and Thomas Cummins testified at Gray's trial that he had raped the women. Cummins said that Gray had threatened to \u201cpop him\u201d. But by their account, Gray had left the bridge by the time the women were allegedly forced into the river and he was found guilty of murder as an accomplice. Gray continued to insist he was innocent until 26 October 2005 when he was executed by lethal injection. Before he died, he made a final statement. He said: <a href=\"http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/gray989.htm\">\"I go with a peace of mind that comes from never having taken a human life. This is not a death, it is a lynching.\u201d</a></p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-reggie-clemons\"> <h2>Reggie Clemons</h2> <p>Born on 30 August 1971, Clemons was the youngest of six children of Roosevelt and Vera Robinson (now Thomas). Clemons had a difficult childhood, suffering from abuse on the part of his father. Vera eventually divorced Roosevelt, and remarried a church pastor, Reynolds Thomas, when Clemons was six years old. Clemons's home background stabilised, and by the time of the Chain of Rocks incident, aged 19, he was described as a compassionate and caring teenager who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p3/a58725\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">showed no inclination towards violence and had no previous criminal record</a>.</p> <p>Clemons was put on trial for the murder of the Kerry sisters on the basis of his own <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p5/a58727\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">confession to raping one of the women and on the testimony of Thomas Cummins and Daniel Winfrey</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p11/a58868\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Clemons complained two days after he had made the confession that it had been beaten out of him</a>.</p> <p>Cummins told the jury at the trial that he heard Clemons and Winfrey discussing whether he should be allowed to live or die.

Aged 16 at the time of his arrest, he was brought up by a succession of relatives and suffered periods of abandonment. By 15 he had a drug and alcohol problem, and dropped out of school.</p> <p>At trial, his lawyer presented the jury with evidence of Richardson's impaired mental capacity and brain damage. Richardson was the first of the four co-defendants to be arrested after police found a flashlight on the bridge that he had stolen and lost on the night of the murders. Under questioning, Richardson turned on Marlin Gray and Clemons, saying that they had killed the Kerry sisters. But at his trial Thomas Cummins, the sisters' cousin, said it was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p11/a58868\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Richardson who pushed the women in and then ordered him to jump after them</a>.</p> <p>In July 1993 Richardson was found guilty of murder, but the jury was unable to decide whether or not he should be given the death penalty. In their place, the trial judge put him on death row. He came within an hour of execution in March 2001, and two years later had his <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365264-6-clemons-cert.html#document/p18/a59196\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">death sentence commuted to life imprisonment with no chance of parole</a>.

In 2008, he came within 12 days of execution by lethal injection. In May that year he was issued with a death warrant and for the next 18 days he sat and waited in his prison cell, a short dead-man-walking distance from the death chamber. It was, he says, \"a real strange time.\"</p> <p>\"Each day was real slow. You're paying attention to each and every little detail \u2013 every crack on the floor, how your shoe strings are laying that day \u2013 because these might be the very last moments of your life.\"</p> <p>When his mother Vera Thomas came to see him, he was forced to talk to her from behind a thick bullet-proof glass window, with his hands cuffed to his waist and his feet shackled, even though he was in the middle of a maximum security prison from which there was no chance of escape. Mother and son were put in a visitors' room that just happened to be located next to the death chamber. As Clemons looked out at his mother through the glass, he could see behind her the door through which he knew he would soon be passing.</p> <p>He had plenty of time during those 18 days to think about the specifics of what would happen to him once he walked through that door and was strapped onto the gurney. \"The first drug is supposed to put you to sleep,\" he says, referring to the beginning of the lethal injection process. \"The second drug paralyses you so that you can't move, so you can't talk or speak or anything. And then the third drug is like injecting fire into your veins, because what it does is fries your nervous system. Which I imagine makes your body feel like it's on fire. But I don't know. I've never been there, and nobody has come back from that to tell us.\"</p> <p>Twelve days before the execution, the US court of appeals granted Clemons a temporary reprieve. The death he had imagined in such close detail was on hold, for now.</p> <p>Reggie Clemons is on death row at the Potosi Correctional Center, pictured, an austere low-lying complex surrounded by glistening barbed wire electrified fences deep in the countryside of Missouri. We are taken into the bowels of the institution, along echoing corridors, through remote-controlled iron doors, to a small white cell where Clemons is summoned to meet us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396351123\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/8/1344440520856/The-Potosi-Correctional-C-004.jpg\" alt=\"The Potosi Correctional Center in Missouri\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Potosi Correctional Center in Missouri. Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the ensuing three hours, we discuss his version of what happened over the Mississippi river, his experience of living for almost two decades under the permanent threat of execution, and his reflections on the impact of the death penalty on American society.</p> <p>Clemons was sentenced to death in 1993 for the murder of two young sisters, Julie and Robin Kerry. The women fell to their deaths off the Chain of Rocks bridge \u2013 pushed with Clemons's connivance, the prosecution said \u2013 into the brutal waters of the Mississippi on the night of the 4/5 April 1991.</p> <p>Clemons will not go into great detail about the events of that night, under instruction from his lawyers. But he does confirm that he and his three co-defendants \u2013 Marlin Gray, Antonio Richardson and Daniel Winfrey \u2013 did all go onto the bridge, which at the time was fenced off and derelict, but used as a popular hangout for teenagers.</p> <p>\"We'd been watching a [St Louis] Blues hockey game, against Chicago I think,\" he recalls. After the game, they drove to the bridge and there, some time before midnight, they bumped into a group of strangers, the Kerry sisters and their cousin, Thomas Cummins.</p> <p>\"We came across each other, talked to each other, had a casual conversation, about the bridge, talking about a movie that had been made up there. We talked about how a lot of different people hung out up there. And the graffiti that was painted on the surface of the bridge, reflecting all the different types of people that did come up there. It's just a nice casual conversation, and then we parted ways.\"</p> <p>Clemons says the conversation lasted about 15 minutes. \"Then we left the bridge. The state says we came back. I'm saying we didn't.\"</p> <p>He won't go further than that, saying that he is reserving his full account of what happened on the bridge that night for when he is given a chance to clear his name in a court of law.</p> <p><strong>'The rape charges were used to inflame the passions of the jury'</strong></p> <p>Though Clemons was found guilty of murdering the sisters, he was never accused of having directly pushed them into the river. No witness testified having seen him do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396351124\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/8/1344440725202/Reggie-Clemons-mugshot-004.jpg\" alt=\"Reggie Clemons mugshot\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reggie Clemons mugshot. Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rather, he was convicted as an accomplice. The prosecution alleged that Clemons and his three co-defendants had returned to the bridge and accosted the Kerry sisters and their cousin, robbing them and raping the women. Clemons was alleged to have thrown the sisters' clothes off the bridge, before all three victims were forced into the river (the sisters drowned while Cummins testified that he swam to the bank). Afterwards, a co-defendant claimed in incriminating testimony that Clemons had bragged to his friends: \"We threw them off.\"</p> <p>Clemons' link to the murders, according to the prosecution, was that he had committed rape and robbery and was therefore implicated. Yet rape and robbery charges were kept separate from the murder counts, and were dismissed soon after the murder trial had ended.</p> <p>\"The rape and robbery charges were used to inflame the passions of the jury, as they were supposed to connect me to the murder,\" Clemons says. \"I thought they were going to take me to trial for those charges later, but they never did. I am still pushing for it, because I strongly feel that in front of a jury I would be fully acquitted.\"</p> <p>At his murder trial, the prosecution relied heavily on the testimonies of Thomas Cummins and Daniel Winfrey, then aged 15, who was one of Clemons' three co-defendants. Both Cummins and Winfrey were white, while Clemons, Marlin Gray and Antonio Richardson were African Americans, lending a stark racial element to the proceedings.</p> <p>Both Cummins and Winfrey arguably had ulterior motives to implicate Clemons \u2013 Cummins because he was himself <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59316\">initially accused by police of murdering his cousins</a>, though the investigation of him was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59317\">later dropped</a>, and Winfrey because the prosecution arranged a plea bargain with him in which he would be spared the death penalty in exchange for turning star witness against his black co-defendants. He pleaded guilty, was given a 30-year sentence and was released on parole in 2007.</p> <p>\"I was a little angry and confused,\" Clemons says about Winfrey, who he had never met before the night the Kerry sisters died. \"I didn't fully understand why he made the deal and turned states [witness]. I've wondered about it over the years. He was young, 15 years old. Here it is, he's facing the real serious case like this, with some strangers that he don't even know. So \u2026\"</p> <p>The other key evidence presented to the jury at the 1993 trial was Clemons's own confession to police made two days after the Kerry sisters went missing. In it, Clemons admitted to raping one of the sisters, though not to murdering them.</p> <p>Twenty years later, Clemons still insists, as he told internal affairs investigators 48 hours after he made the confession, that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p9/a58864\">it was beaten out of him</a>. He says: \"I remember police mainly beating me in the chest. While they were beating me, they were telling me what they wanted to admit to. One of their punches skipped off my shoulder and caught me in my cheek, cut me right in front of my eye. Then another punch caused my lip to start bleeding.\"</p> <p>Clemons says that he agreed to make a statement just to \"get my bearings a little bit. I needed a break from this beating before these people kill me, so I can think a little bit.\"</p> <p>He began to give a statement, Clemons says, along the lines dictated by the detectives, but in the middle of it he blurted out that he was being assaulted. They immediately stopped the tape and discarded it. \"They came back about five minutes later, and started beating on me some more. So I made a second tape. I barely even remember it. It's like, hazy, the memory of it.\"</p> <p>The second tape was his confession to rape, which was crucial in putting him on death row.</p> <p>The account that Clemons gave the Guardian is the same as what he told officers of the St Louis police internal affairs unit w<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p11/a58868\">hen he complained of being beaten up</a> two days after his initial interview, and echoes too what his lawyers said in appeal documents lodged with the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p16/a58907\">Missouri supreme court</a>. Yet why did he make that tape when it in effect put the seal on his own death sentence?</p> <p>\"If you believe that someone is willing to beat you to death, while they're beating you they can just about get you to admit to anything.\"</p> <p>In addition to the police who he alleges attacked him, Clemons is very critical of other aspects of the criminal justice system. He accuses his own lawyers at the time of the trial of acting against his interests \u2013 the two lead attorneys were going through a divorce at the time of his trial and he believes they were ill-prepared to defend him.</p> <p>A separate team of defence lawyers who represented Clemons in his appeal for clemency at the time of his 2009 scheduled execution alleged in court papers that his trial attorneys had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p12/a58715\">\"failed him at every stage of his representation\"</a>.</p> <p>All in all, Clemons says, \"the pack was stacked against me. I knew I was going to get the death sentence, even before the trial started. I had already been tried and convicted in the media.\"</p> <p>In separate trials, Marlin Gray and Antonio Richardson were also put on death row. Richardson later had his conviction commuted to life imprisonment, but <a href=\"http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/gray989.htm\">Gray was executed by lethal injection in October 2005</a>.</p> <p>Clemons says Gray's death hit him hard. \"He clearly didn't have any blood on his hands, either. No one said he pushed the two young women into the water. So I felt, well, they've executed him, they definitely can't not execute me. It created a feeling of inevitability. It's only by mercy of God that I feel I'm here still breathing today.\"</p> <p>Before he died, Gray seemed to Clemons to have lost all hope. \"He kind of took the attitude of 'whatever.' At one point he said: 'I can't believe you still think that people are going to listen.' But I said, that don't mean I got to quit talking, trying to explain, and explain, and explain.\"</p> <p>In doing all that explaining, over so many years, Clemons has thought a lot about the death penalty and its impact on him. \"It's like somebody pointing a gun to your head, every day, and telling you that I'm going to kill you some day, I just haven't decided when.\"</p> <p><strong>'The death penalty in America is poisonous'</strong></p> <p>Now aged 40, he's lost count of the number of his fellow death row inmates who have been taken away, never to return. \"I'm too young to know as many dead people as I do,\" he says.</p> <p>But he believes he's come to terms with the surreal character of life on death row. \"This might sound crazy to some people, but I'm already free on the inside. I know I don't belong in here, and I'm free to think for myself. If my mind and spirit is free, my body is soon to follow.\"</p> <p>He's also had time to think about the death penalty's impact on America in a wider sense. Before his arrest, he was an advocate of capital punishment. Now he's come to the conclusion that the death penalty has a pervasive and negative effect that permeates itself throughout society.</p> <p>\"The death penalty in America is poisonous to the social consciousness. It makes people consider death as a solution. Murder as a solution.</p> <p>\"The death penalty desensitizes people to the human aspect of crime and punishment. You forget about the human being. You have to dehumanise somebody in order to kill them. And it's not a penalty at all. We are all going to die some day. So who are you punishing? Me or my family?\"</p> <p>He says his heart goes out to the family of Julie and Robin Kerry. \"I can't imagine what they're going through. I wish I could find a way to take their pain away, but that's not possible. You can't bring people back.\"</p> <p>Clemons says he can't express remorse, \"because remorse requires that you're guilty of something.\" But what about the two women who died on the bridge?</p> <p>\"I think about them a lot,\" Clemons says. \"It's sad that they're not here to see the first black president, because from what I've read about them, that's something that they would definitely want to see. I've read that they were against the death penalty, and they would be fighting against a lot of wrongs that's going on in the world.\"</p> <p>To hear a man on death row for double murder saying that he thinks a lot about his alleged victims will be offensive to people sceptical of Clemons's protestations of innocence. It may also be difficult to hear for the family of the Kerry sisters, who have largely avoided media contact and are disdainful towards what one family member has called the \"Reggie Clemons circus\".</p> <p>No matter what comes out of the September hearings into his case, there will always be those who see Reggie Clemons as a cold-hearted killer deserving of the ultimate punishment. So how does he deal with the knowledge that a perception of guilt will hang over him always?</p> <p>\"Whatever conclusion a person reaches, that is their own choice. I don't have any control over that, and I've learned not to give a lot away to what somebody thinks about me.</p> <p>\"Not because I'm arrogant or because I'm unconcerned about other people's opinions. But because I know, and God knows. I know I'm not a rapist. I know I'm not a murderer or a killer. I know that I didn't do any of these things. I know I'm innocent.\"</p>",
  "<p>This is the third book, in the first series, of Warrior Cats, after Into the wild and Fire and Ice. I think that this book is the best in the series, by far, as it has many moments where you just cant put it down and some moments where you are so gripped by the book that you forget that you're not a warrior cat yourself. If you like fantasy and nature, and you don't mind a death or two, then this book is for you!</p> <p>Forest of Secrets is based in a large forest, owned by four clans of wild cats, called Thunder clan, Shadow clan, Wind clan and River clan and they all go by a cat law called the warrior code. The story's main character is a large, orange tabby, former kittypet (a cat owned by two legs in cat language), who belongs to thunder clan, called Fireheart. Fireheart is a warrior, along with his best friend Graystripe, and together they experience both sad and happy moments in their exciting clan life. </p> <p>One of the main moments is when Graystripe falls in love with a River clan cat, called Silverstream, in a past book, and they have kits. Unfortunately, whilst having kits, Silerstream dies, because of blood loss, and that creates a terribly sad moment for Graystripe. </p> <p>On a happier note, after the discovery and disposal of an evil deputy, a large dark tabby called Tigerclaw, Fireheart is chosen deputy of thunder clan, by Bluestar, the clan leader, despite his old kittypet roots.

  "<p>Prince Charles's royal aides threatened legal action against newspapers if they published photographs of Prince Harry naked in a Las Vegas hotel room, despite the fact they were freely available on the internet.</p> <p>Lawyers at Harbottle &amp; Lewis, the London legal firm, swung into action on Wednesday after they were notified by St James's Palace that a number of British newspapers had expressed an interest in buying the photographs and had intended to publish.</p> <p>The photographs were being sold for \u00a310,000 by the Splash News picture agency and it is understood about 10 British and Irish titles expressed an interest in buying them. So far no British titles have published the pictures, either in print or online, but three Irish titles have done so.</p> <p>Newspaper editors are understood to have been asked informally by royal aides not to run the pictures at lunchtime on Wednesday. Later in the day a strongly worded letter from Harbottle &amp; Lewis was circulated via the Press Complaints Commission, along with a covering note from the regulator saying it was happy to pass on St James's Palace's view that publication would be in breach of clause three of the PCC's editors' code of practice. The clause says \"it is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent\".</p> <p>The letter from Harbottle &amp; Lewis warns editors that publication outside the UK is no justification for publication in Britain.</p> <p>\"The only possible reason for publication of the photographs is one of prurience and nothing more,\" said the letter from the law firm.</p> <p>\"No matter of public interest as those words are understood in English law is raised by these photographs. The fact that they have appeared in another jurisdiction is meaningless.\"</p> <p>The letter ended by warning that the members of the royal family \"entirely reserve their rights as to any further steps\" should publication occur.</p> <p>No British paper published the photos although the Irish edition of the Daily Star put them on the front page. Daily Star proprietor Richard Desmond has removed all his papers from the PCC regime, but the title is understood to have made a decision not to publish in Britain.</p> <p>Neil Wallis, former executive editor of the News of the World, said the decision by UK tabloids not to publish the photos demonstrated the \"chilling effect\" the Leveson inquiry was having on papers.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/neil-wallis/what-delight-for-the-guardian_b_1823942.html?utm_hp_ref=uk\" title=\"\">a blog on the Huffington Post</a> he said Lord Justice Leveson had \"neutered the great British press and made it a laughing stock\".</p> <p>However, Peter Willis, editor (weekday) of the Daily Mirror. said that, on the contrary, the decision showed self-regulation was working.</p> <p>\"We are constantly told the PCC is a toothless tiger and this shows that it is not. We don't want PCC judgments against us. We drafted the code and we signed up to it,\" he said.</p> <p>In its coverage of the affair on Thursday, the Daily Mail points out the pictures were \"banned in Britain \u2013 but the pictures can be seen worldwide\", listing more than 100 websites, newspapers and other news organisations, including US broadcasters CNN and CBS, which published the photos.</p> <p>Daily Mail executives have been among the most forthright voices at the Leveson inquiry warning that foreign publication on the internet risked undermining UK press regulation.</p> <p>Ian Mallon, deputy editor of the Evening Herald in Ireland, which used the pictures, said the brouhaha over privacy was just a \"nonsense\" and said British newspapers had been cowed into censorship for all the wrong reasons.</p> <p>\"Prince Harry obviously didn't mind being photographed ... The big thing now is the fear factor that comes from London and editors who are absolutely petrified to be seen to be doing something untoward,\" Mallon added, referring to the prospect of Leveson recommending the abolition of self-regulation of the British press.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>The excitement generated by the London Olympics failed to trigger a spending spree on the high street, according to Britain's leading business organisation.</p> <p>In its monthly health check of consumer spending, the CBI said retailers' hopes for a modest boost from the Games has been dashed.</p> <p>It also warned that the climate would remain tough for shops and stores over the coming months, with jobs and investment likely to be cut.</p> <p>Judith McKenna, chair of the CBI distributive trades panel and Asda's chief operating officer, said: \"Although this summer's events created a mood of celebration across the nation, these figures would suggest this positivity did not extend to the high street.\"</p> <p>Anecdotal evidence had suggested an Olympics feelgood factor among shoppers but the CBI's distributive trades survey \u2013 conducted in the first two weeks of August when the Games were taking place \u2013 found no such impact.</p> <p>Of those retailers questioned, 27% said sales were higher in August than they had been in a year, while 31% said they were lower. The rounded balance of -3 points was weaker than the +3 points expected in last month's survey.</p> <p>The CBI reported an easing of shop price inflation to its lowest level in almost three years as retailers sought to attract consumers with bargain offers.</p> <p>Tougher business conditions led to a fall in the number of people employed in retail in the latest quarter, with a further decline expected over the coming month. Business sentiment dropped to its lowest level since the depths of the recession in early 2009, prompting retailers to mothball investment plans.</p>",
  "<p>The first thing that strikes me as I emerge from the tunnel into the middle of <a href=\"http://www.nationalcyclingcentre.com/t/velodrome-track\" title=\"\">Manchester velodrome</a> is the banked sections of curved track at either end of the arena.</p> <p>They tower over me, pitched at a frighteningly steep angle of 42 degrees. A lone rider glides past above me. It looks like a fairground Wall of Death ride.</p> <p>It is eight o'clock on a Monday morning and I am here for my first taste of track cycling. The velodrome \u2013 part of the National Cycling Centre - is in constant use by schools, clubs, racing leagues and Team GB, so sessions for beginners are usually squeezed in at the start or end of the day. Limited to 15 riders, they are also usually full weeks in advance. I booked the last place on this morning's session a week ago.</p> <p>I am one of four track virgins. The others in our group have done at least one track session before, and are working their way towards accredited status by practising specific techniques such as slipstreaming and stacking.</p> <p>Our teacher is British Cycling coach John Daly. He's seen interest in the track soar since the thrilling and occasionally terrifying exploits of Team GB at the Olympics.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Before the Olympics, my club, Eastlands Velo, didn't have a waiting list for membership. Now it's eight to 10 weeks for anyone who wants to join.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>We are introduced to our Dolan track bikes. They have no brakes and a fixed gear ratio that means the pedals will always be turning whether our legs want them to be or not.</p> <p>After clipping in both feet while holding on to the barrier, we are told to push off and do a couple of circuits of the wide, inner green zone to get used to the fixed gear. Once we have convinced John we can come to a complete halt against the barrier without tipping over, he sends us out on to the track. The others in our group are already whizzing around the boards. He tells us to do a lap on the inside \"blue band\" to work up our speed and then move on to the track proper after we have checked over our shoulders first.</p> <p>The Siberian pine creaks ominously beneath me as I make the transition.</p> <p>I'm instinctively bent low on the drops, wanting to be near nonexistent brake levers. It's a few laps before I become accustomed to the fact there are no obstacles, dead ends or traffic lights to worry about, and it's not as if any riders in front of me can suddenly decelerate. Being brakeless is no longer that daunting. I'm more concerned about those steep curved sections. Will I have the confidence \u2013 and speed \u2013 to ride around the top?</p> <p>Daly warned me of the most common beginner's mistakes made by roadies on the track:</p> <p>\u2022 Stopping pedaling: \"You can get thrown off your bike if you forget to keep pedaling.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Flicking the elbow to wave the rider behind through: \"That isn't good enough on the track, we want you to have a good look behind you so you know where the other riders are.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Going too high and too slow around the steep sections: \"You'll slide down the banking.\"</p> <p>After a few circuits either side of the black \"datum line\" \u2013 along which all the intermediate track measurements are taken and where the angle of the banking is at its shallowest \u2013 I check behind me and move up the boards, nearer to the red \"sprinter's line\". After another circuit, I'm feeling confident enough to aim above the blue \"stayer's line\" the next time I hit the curve.</p> <p>Within a couple of laps I'm riding above the adverts painted on the track. It's a heart-stopping moment. It actually feels colder up here. The riders below me seem a long way down. I get some idea of just how steep and high the curve is when I plunge back down to the black line \u2013 I can feel the wind racing past my ears and my stomach struggling to keep up with my body.</p> <p>I learn later that the angle of the exit from the bankings is slightly steeper than that of the entry so that a rider is \"catapulted\" along the straights.</p> <p>It's instantly addictive and I want another fix straight away. I spin around the inside of the track, undertaking \u2013 legitimately - the more experienced riders who are practising their slipstreaming above the blue line, and launch myself up the next curve, remembering that I have to keep pedaling when on my road bike it would have been possible to let my momentum propel me up.</p> <p>The bikes aren't equipped with speedometers, so I've no idea whether I'm threatening the world records of Team GB's Olympic heroes, but it's certainly a lot faster than anything I've done on my road bike on the flat.</p> <p>By the end of hour-long session, I'm buzzing with excitement, and I'm not the only one. Sixteen-year-old Alex Payne, who had got up at five that morning to get the train from York and had never ridden a bike with clip-on pedals before, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"That whooshing feeling made the whole journey worthwhile. If I can get on any more sessions, I'll definitely be back.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And Luke Norcross, a 15-year-old road cyclist from Stockport who was experiencing his second time on the track, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's really weird. It feels wrong that you're defying gravity and going against all the laws of physics when you ride around those bends. It's a real adrenaline rush.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Taster sessions at the Manchester Velodrome cost \u00a310.50 and include bike and helmet hire. If you don't have shoes with Look Delta cleats, you can hire a pair for \u00a34.20.

  "<p>Britain will deprive developing countries of up to \u00a34bn in tax revenues after a change in the law that could prompt British-owned multinational companies to shift profits into offshore havens, according to a leading charity.</p> <p>A cross-party parliamentary select committee on Thursday called on the government to conduct a review of the change to the controlled foreign companies (CFC) rules which could have a \"detrimental impact\" on the tax revenues of developing countries.</p> <p>The Commons international development select committee issued its warning in a report which cites a claim by <a href=\"www.actionaid.org\" title=\"\">ActionAid</a> that the changes, which will be implemented from next January, could cost developing countries \u00a34bn.</p> <p>Labour said the changes, announced by George Osborne in this year's budget, \"make a mockery\" of the chancellor's pledge to crack down on tax avoidance.</p> <p>As part of a drive to make Britain's tax system more competitive, Osborne announced a relaxation of the tax haven CFC rules which currently deter British-owned companies from moving profits to countries with a lower corporate tax rate than the UK. After the changes, Britain will only impose a levy to make up the difference in tax if the profits have been moved out of the UK.</p> <p>Any profits moved from a developing country into a tax haven by a UK-owned company will no longer have to pay the levy.</p> <p>The select committee said: \"If approved, the newly-relaxed controlled foreign companies (CFC) rules \u2026 will incentivise multinational corporations to shift profits into tax havens.</p> <p>\"This is likely to have a significant detrimental impact on the tax revenues of developing countries.</p> <p>\"The government should designate a DFID [Department for International Development] ministerial responsibility for the development impact of tax and fiscal policy.\"</p> <p>Ivan Lewis, the shadow international development secretary, said: \"George Osborne's determination to press ahead with these changes makes a mockery of the Tory-led government's commitment to tackling tax avoidance.</p> <p>\"Giving aid to developing countries with one hand while removing tax revenue with the other allows UK-based multinational companies to shirk their responsibilities at the expense of the poorest people in the world.</p> <p>\"Once again the Tories are demonstrating whose side they are really on.\"</p> <p>ActionAid told the Commons committee that the changes could deprive developing countries of \u00a34bn in revenues.</p> <p>In a written submission to the committee, the charity called on the government to heed a call by the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank to assess the impact of such tax changes.</p> <p>The charity wrote: \"ActionAid is concerned that the proposals will eliminate a significant deterrent that discourages UK-based companies from shifting profits from developing countries to tax havens.</p> <p>\"We estimate that the reforms may cost developing countries as much as \u00a34bn and have urged the treasury and DFID to conduct their own spillover analysis, as recommended by the international organisations. No such analysis has been undertaken.\"</p> <p>ActionAid cited the UK-based brewer SABMiller, maker of Peroni and Grolsch beers, which has shifted an estimated \u00a3100m of profits from subsidiaries in developing countries to tax havens.</p> <p>In its evidence to MPs, the charity cited its 2010 report on the brewer, which estimated that payments from its subsidiaries in Africa and India to Switzerland, the Netherlands and Mauritius deprived the developing countries of \u00a320m. This would have been enough to educate 250,000 children.</p> <p>The charity cited the case of <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/102674/martas_story.html\" title=\"\">Marta Luttgrodt, who pays \u00a347 a year in tax on a small bar in the Ghanian capital Accra</a>. By contrast the SABMiller brewery, which supplies her bar, paid no income tax in Ghana.</p> <p>Sir Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat MP who chairs the international development select committee, endorsed ActionAid's call for a government analysis of the changes.</p> <p>Bruce said: \"The government is committed to supporting economic growth in developing countries to reduce their dependency on aid.</p> <p>\"While this is clearly the right thing to do, it would be deeply unfortunate if the government's efforts were undermined by its own tax rules.</p> <p>\"Some estimates claim that the revised CFC rules will cost developing countries up to \u00a34bn. We do not know if this estimate is correct, but the government cannot legitimately refute the \u00a34bn figure unless it is prepared to conduct its own analysis. That is what we are urging it to do.\"</p> <p>SABMiller welcomed the select committee report but rejected the claims by ActionAid about its tax affairs. A spokesperson said: \"The international development select committee report makes a number of recommendations which we welcome and support. We particularly welcome the report's recognition of the role that business can play in reducing developing countries' dependency on aid.</p> <p>\"However, SABMiller strongly rejects the allegations made by ActionAid in 2010 about its tax affairs. These were based on flawed and inaccurate assumptions. SABMiller does not use aggressive planning, nor do we make charges or set up company structures for the purpose of minimising tax.\" The company gave a <a href=\"http://www.sabmiller.com/index.asp?pageid=149&amp;newsid=1455\" title=\"\">detailed response</a> to the ActionAid claims in 2010.</p>",
  "<p>More and more people cross international borders because their lives have been ruined by an earthquake, flood, drought or hurricane. But they face a black hole of international law. No major migrant destination country allows people legal entry for this reason.</p> <p>Humanitarian permission may be given to enter rich countries for other reasons. If violence has ruined your life in the country you live in, you may qualify to enter as a \"refugee\" or \"asylee\", as <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/lpr_fr_2011.pdf\" title=\"\">16% of US immigrants did last year</a> (pdf). Equally, if your life was ruined back home by a natural disaster and you enter a rich country without authorisation, many countries won't immediately send you back. But the world has so far decided that the right amount of new, authorised migration because of natural disasters \u2013 no matter how horrific \u2013 is zero.</p> <p>Is zero the right number? Think of Haiti. <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13623699.2010.535279\" title=\"\">At least 150,000 people died there two years ago</a> when houses and buildings could not withstand a cataclysmic earthquake. Many <a href=\"http://www.prio.no/CSCW/Datasets/Armed-Conflict/Battle-Deaths/\" title=\"\">wars don't have a toll as large</a>, or effects as lasting. The US response was to admit a tiny number of Haitians for emergency medical treatment, and to <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/news/2010/01/15/secretary-napolitano-temporary-protected-status-tps-haitian-nationals\" title=\"\">delay most deportations</a>, but not one Haitian could be admitted to the US because of the disaster. This would have been completely different if war had struck Haiti.</p> <p>So, what if a limited number of humanitarian entry slots were offered to people affected by natural disaster? How many should it be? And how would it work? There are precedents. For a generation (1952-80), the US unilaterally defined \"refugee\" to include people fleeing \"natural catastrophes\", but the <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1425143\" title=\"\">provision was almost never utilised</a>. Some other countries have similar de jure provisions today; Sweden, for example, <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/479df7472.pdf\" title=\"\">allows for protection of migrants</a> (pdf) \"unable to return to the country of origin because of an environmental disaster\". But there is no equivalent of the <a href=\"http://www.refugees.org/about-us/faqs.html\" title=\"\">international refugee system</a> to realise these on-paper mechanisms.</p> <p>One approach is case by case. Over the past year, my colleagues and I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/feb/20/immigration-passport-fresh-development-frontier\" title=\"\">have led a successful effort</a> to extend a modest, new visa opportunity to Haitians, explicitly for earthquake relief. <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1423717/\" title=\"\">Our research</a>, supported by the MacArthur Foundation, showed that migration policy would be a highly effective and inexpensive complement to other US earthquake relief efforts. On this basis, we asked the US government to reverse a ban on Haiti's participation in its largest low-skill work visa programme. The US did so but, most notably, it did so because of the horrific disaster Haiti had just experienced \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003465304323031058\" title=\"\">with bipartisan support</a>, in a bad economy. This step will <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/migration_tool_disaster_recovery/economic_impacts_h2_haiti\" title=\"\">barely affect</a> overall immigration to the US, but could bring hundreds of millions of new dollars to Haiti at no fiscal cost.</p> <p>Another approach is to review more systematically how destination countries allocate their limited slots of \"assistance\" migration. <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/review/2010/irrc-879-kolmannskog-trebbi.pdf\" title=\"\">International discussion is under way</a> (pdf) on how this might be done, but consensus is far off. There is less controversy about giving legal status as \"internally displaced persons\" to those affected by natural calamity who move domestically. But those crossing borders due to natural events still have no clear legal status anywhere. Many years of discussions in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and other forums have led to little change. Elizabeth Perris, Michael Cernea and Daniel Petz <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2011/9/idp%20climate%20change/09_idp_climate_change.pdf\" title=\"\">have summarised the state of this debate</a> (pdf) as part of the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/idp\" title=\"\">Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement</a>, a leading voice for reform in this area.</p> <p>These efforts face political barriers, but our work on Haiti proves such barriers have limits. Admitting humanitarian migrants like refugees isn't a handout, it's an investment. Overall, <a href=\"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003465304323031058\" title=\"\">refugees contribute to the economy</a> at least as much as economic migrants. Great Americans like Intel co-founder Andrew Grove and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright arrived as humanitarian migrants. And the US refugee programme has weathered many economic downturns and political upheavals in its 60-year history.</p> <p>A systematic policy tackling the challenge of post-disaster migration remains far off. Without a major forcing event such as the humanitarian disasters of the second world war, which gave us modern refugee law, that situation seems unlikely to change. Such a moment might have come for natural-disaster migrants had thousands of Haitians arrived on the shores of Florida after the earthquake, but crushing poverty in Haiti and a US naval blockade put paid to that.</p> <p>This story is not over, however. With climate change will come the likelihood of increased damage from floods, droughts and hurricanes, especially in the poorest countries. A better migration policy would foresee and accommodate these 21st-century realities, although it might once again arrive too late to prevent initial tragedies.</p>",
  "<p>We've both started working as graduate developers for the Guardian in the past year, but have both taken quite different routes to get here. <strong>Max</strong>: I came from a fairly typical Computer Science background, after which I worked in a small digital agency for a year before joining the Guardian. <strong>Lindsey</strong>: I studied mathematics at university and undertook roles in the finance and charity sectors before getting into software development.</p> <p><strong>Getting into software development at graduate level doesn't necessarily require a Computer Science degree.</strong> Often the skills employers look for is an ability to problem solve, reason and communicate. Learning to program on the job is challenging, but not impossible. Working on real systems and on genuine problems makes you consider the wider implications of your code, beyond whether it works as you expect on your own machine. Picking up a couple of online programming courses and writing some small test applications can be really helpful in getting to grips with the basics. <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\">Coursera</a> run a variety of excellent courses, from an introduction to programming to some advanced computer science concepts \u2013 and for free!</p> <p><strong>Being receptive and able to learn new technologies is more important than knowledge of any particular language or framework.</strong> Becoming proficient in a different programming language is much easier after you know one \u2013 don't be put off from applying to companies who use different technologies to those you are familiar with. The pace of change in the industry means that everybody has to constantly be learning, not just graduates.</p> <p><strong>There are no standard job titles. </strong>You could be a developer, software developer, web developer, back-end developer, a programmer, a computer scientist, or an engineer. Sometimes there's a hierarchical prefix too, such as graduate, junior, senior or lead. Furthermore, 'graduate' jobs aren't necessarily taken by those fresh out of university: we both worked at other organisations before joining the Guardian.</p> <p><strong>There are typically more opportunities for career development at a large company than at a smaller one.</strong> At the start of your career you should be thinking about where you can learn the most, and large organisations will have more resources to expend on staff development. Here at the Guardian, we have the chance to move between projects, gain exposure of different languages and platforms, and learn from more experienced developers. However, working in a smaller organisation also has its benefits: your role will be broader. This can mean not only working on software development, but also testing, deployment and user support \u2013 skills that you probably wouldn't gain otherwise.</p> <p><strong>You probably won't know how to deal with a large legacy system, yet most organisations will have one. </strong> It's probably huge, and probably essential, and all the newer developers are a little scared of it. There's probably no documentation, and if there is, it's out of date. Most or all of the developers who originally worked on it have left the company/are dead. It's not unknown for large companies to have servers that are kept running because nobody is left in the company knows what they do \u2013 turning them off could mean turning off something essential. Eek!</p> <p><strong>You probably won't realise how much of the development process isn't programming.</strong> There are many different roles needed to plan, develop and sustain a system \u2013 a typical team at the Guardian includes front-end and back-end developers, QA (quality assurance) and UX (user experience) specialists, as well as product and project management. Furthermore, there is our Systems team, who manage the technology infrastructure, and the software architects, who make high-level decisions about how different applications work and interact.</p> <p>Whatever your background, starting as a graduate in software development can be challenging. However, the culture of continuous learning and the satisfaction of seeing something you have helped create being used by potentially millions of people makes it all worthwhile.</p> <p><em>What have you learnt about working in development that you wish you'd known before you started?

  "<p><strong>Director: Jim McBride<br>Entertainment grade: D\u2013<br>History grade: C+</strong></p> <p>Jerry Lee Lewis broke through as a rock'n'roll musician in the late 1950s. His career foundered after he bigamously married Myra Gale Brown, his first cousin once removed, when she was just 13 years old.</p> <h2>Romance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395093625\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345653820694/Great-Balls-of-Fire-004.jpg\" alt=\"Great Balls of Fire\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Balls of Fire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1956, the 21-year-old Lewis moves in with his cousin JW Brown in Memphis, Tennessee. Immediately, he clocks Brown's 12-year-old daughter, Myra Gale. It's not great for a 21-year-old to be macking on a 12-year-old, but the fact that the film casts Dennis Quaid, then 35 but looking raddled thanks to a bad peroxide job, opposite Winona Ryder, then 18 but looking much younger, makes it seem even worse. Quaid's performance is fine \u2013 the real Jerry Lee Lewis and the real Myra Gale Brown both found it convincing \u2013 but he is simply too old for the role. Whereas Lewis's brashness, selfishness and recklessness may be to some extent understandable in a young lad, it's desperate and creepy in a man who appears to be approaching middle age.</p> <h2>Music</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395093626\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345653859106/Great-Balls-of-Fire-004.jpg\" alt=\"Great Balls of Fire\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Balls of Fire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Sun Records, Sam Phillips \u2013 the man who discovered Elvis Presley \u2013 listens to Lewis's demo, Crazy Arms. After just a few seconds, he says: \"I can sell that.\" This is accurate. Looking for a song to launch his career, Lewis sneaks into a dance hall amid an otherwise entirely black audience to hear Big Maybelle (Valerie Wellington) singing Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On. Though the scene is fictionalised, it is a neat way of informing the viewer that the song was first recorded by a black singer, and that rock'n'roll involved a lot of white performers appropriating black music, usually without credit. </p> <h2>Fame</h2> <p>Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On propels Lewis to overnight stardom. Elvis trudges into Sun Records, looking baleful. Anyone watching this film who didn't know about Elvis Presley would get the impression that Elvis's career ended in 1958 when he joined the army, and Jerry Lee Lewis then took over as the greatest star in rock'n'roll. Of course, there probably isn't anyone watching this film who doesn't know about Elvis Presley. </p> <h2>Marriage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395093627\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345654034539/Great-Balls-of-Fire-004.jpg\" alt=\"Great Balls of Fire\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Balls of Fire Photograph: C5 TV</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C5 TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the screaming teenyboppers, Lewis has set his sights on Myra. He takes her for something called a Kreme Cup. She starts talking about the H-bomb and crying. Thoughtfully, he makes a move on her. Not long afterwards, they're out for a drive when Lewis abruptly presents her with a marriage licence. \"I'm only 13 years old,\" she says. It's too late \u2013 they're already heading across state lines into Mississippi, towards a rickety chapel. In real life, according to Myra's autobiography, Lewis did at least ask her two days before, rather than when they were already on the road.</p> <h2>Law</h2> <p>In 1957, the legal age for marriage in Mississippi was 14 for men and 12 for women, though it was revised upwards by a law passed that year. This particular marriage, Lewis's third despite his own still-tender years, was illegal on grounds of bigamy. Unfortunately, the real story gets a lot darker than the film is prepared to admit. Perhaps it hopes the viewer might somehow root for Lewis. By this point, that's quite a challenge. </p> <h2>Scandal</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395093628\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345653962514/Great-Balls-of-Fire-004.jpg\" alt=\"Great Balls of Fire\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Balls of Fire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the height of Jerry Lee's fame, the Lewises travel to London for a tour. They're met at the airport by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cook\">Peter Cook</a>. Yes, <em>that</em> Peter Cook. He's playing a reporter. \"I hate covering arrivals,\" he moans. \"Didn't hear you complaining when it was Liberace,\" says a fellow reporter. \"Oh, look here,\" Cook snaps back. \"You're not suggesting that an artiste of Liberace's stature can be likened to the boogie-woogie of the gum-chewing country bumpkin?\" Best moment in this movie by miles. The film is correct in suggesting that the London press exposed Lewis's marriage, that he cut short his tour, and that the scandal ended the superstar phase of his career. However, it apparently feels it must end on a happy note, so there's a rousing final sing-song. In real life, there was no happy note. As the real Myra wrote, \"The good ol' days, of which there were exactly 569, were over.\"</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>If you're determined to make a fun, feelgood movie, a marriage between a manipulative bigamist and a terrified minor that spirals off into alcoholism, violence and ruination may not be the ideal subject matter. Even if the music is really, really good.</p>",
  "<p>The news that Syfy are making moves to remake Blake's 7 will thrill as many as it will horrify \u2013 and baffle just as many again.</p> <p>The BBC's <em>other</em> dusty science-fiction classic ran for four series between 1978 and 1981, and followed the adventures of one Roj Blake, a political dissident from the third century of the second calendar who, after being tried and imprisoned on false charges, steals an abandoned ship and leads a group of space rogues on a mission across the galaxy.</p> <p>In one sense it was only a matter of time. Attempts have been made \u2013 or at least rumoured to be made \u2013 to resurrect Blake's 7 since the runaway successes of the Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica revivals. The original Blake's 7 occupied (an admittedly slighter) part of British TV history, part of a shared cultural nostalgia so strong that its essence is familiar even to those far too young to have watched it.</p> <p>And yet the show's grim, paranoid premise perhaps had more of an influence on SyFY's own remake of Battlestar Galactica than the shiny, gung-ho all-Americanism of the original version.</p> <p>Blake's 7 was in many ways ahead of its time. It featured the ambiguous characters and often craven pessimism that would only later become hallmarks of mainstream genre television. And far from it being a 'cult' show, it was watched by 10 million viewers. There are even recent echoes of its space-western stylings in Joss Whedon's beloved yet short-lived Firefly. Blake's 7 creator Terry Nation was of course a regular proponent of authoritarian dystopia in the pop culture. He was also responsible for creating a British institution with his riffs on Nazi Germany, in the shape of the Daleks. And (if spoilers from shows cancelled in 1981 are allowed in this modern internet age), at the end of Blake's 7 everyone died. This was hardly the stuff you expected from late 70s BBC One.</p> <p>Given the finality of the ending, any remake could hardly be a continuation of a much-loved series like, say, Who or Red Dwarf. But the themes at its core are still ripe for plundering in a reboot, in the same way that BSG found resonance. The original show took its lead for the band of rogue dissidents from Robin Hood and his Merry Men. But the question of the guilt, or otherwise, of those who break laws to challenge the establishment is as timely now as ever, seen daily in headlines about the Occupy movement, the Pussy Riot drama or Julian Assange standing on the balcony as if he was Evita. And let's not forget that pop culture-wise, the idea of 'dystopias' have been given a new lease of life in the wake of The Hunger Games.</p> <p>If SyFy get Blake's 7 right, it could be great. That doesn't stop the law of averages meaning it will probably be awful. And the BBC's remake of Nation's other BBC drama, Survivors, didn't exactly set the world on fire. Nevertheless, this is cause for tremendous geek excitement. So what you like to see in a revived Blake's 7? And should it even happen at all?</p>",
  "<p>The Paralympic Games are almost upon us as London gets set to welcome disabled visitors from all over the globe. London has so many attractions offering a great inclusive experience, but I've selected some of my personal favourites. You'll need to do a bit of research to satisfy yourself the venues offer exactly what you need, so check websites before you go. Sites with films, photos and audio-description are particularly helpful and it's good to cross-reference with disability specialists such as <a href=\"http://www.tourismforall.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Tourism for All</a>. A call ahead of your visit is a good idea just in case a particular feature is unavailable for some reason. While some attractions are free, those that charge usually offer concessions to disabled people or their carers.

As a teenager she had gone to America with a theatre group and been trapped there by the outbreak of the second world war.</p> <p>Gustave was born into an immigrant family, originally called Hirchfeld, in Lower Manhattan, New York. He was a press photographer by the age of 17, and already an innovator. Instead of the bulky plate camera and obligatory flash gun carried by the others, he equipped himself with a revolutionary 35mm Leica. His rivals scoffed at such a toy, and the tiny negative it yielded, but he was vindicated when Albert Einstein arrived from Europe to take up the post created for him at Princeton. There was a scramble to photograph the great man in his new lecture hall, but Einstein had sensitive eyes and refused to allow the use of flash. Gustave captured the only pictures that day.</p> <p>He was at the forefront again when conscription was launched, initially by a form of lottery. In New York the first name out of the hat was his. He opted for the Air Corps and was sent to the Pacific as bombardier of a B-17 Flying Fortress. In 1945 his squadron was ordered to fly in support of a mysterious mission by the new B-29 Superfortresses. Gus was issued with a camera and told to photograph anything unusual. What he saw and duly filmed was the mushroom cloud of the second atomic bomb, on Nagasaki.</p> <p>Back in New York and out of uniform at last, he was drawn to the theatre but in the end chose the movies as the hungrier and more exciting medium. His ensuing Hollywood career would span 50 years, on and off. Producers and directors of the calibre of Dore Schary, Joel Rogosin and Alfred Hitchcock admired his work, but his surviving credits are surprisingly few. Stubborn, critical and given to expressing his views bluntly in his gravelly voice, he refused to be associated with any picture that had to be co-written or shot in a manner which departed from his vision of the story.</p> <p>In all, he once calculated, he took his name off 28 movies. Another eight of his screenplays were never made. Television was more rewarding. He contributed to such classic series as Gunsmoke and Lost in Space. Arguably, his personal best was a TV movie, The Sunshine Patriot (1968), which plunged an ordinary citizen into the underworld of espionage.</p> <p>He quit the British television job after a couple of years, by which time he had trained a number of disciples in the art of story editing and had a young daughter, Miranda, born in London. A second girl, Jennifer, arrived when Gus was working again in Hollywood and they had a beach house in Malibu. Eventually, retirement drew them up into the hills to Santa Barbara. Gus's last years were many and full of family love and laughter.</p> <p>He is survived by Daphne, Miranda and Jennifer, and his grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>Prince Charles is said to be furious. Buck House is embarrassed. Over several pages of titillating hand-wringing, the Daily Mail and Telegraph express deep concern. Yes, that \"Prince Harry in nude photos\" row is enlivening a quiet late August. And yet again I find myself warming to the lad. He is fast becoming the royal Boris.</p> <p>I realise there is a recession on, that most of us can't afford a \u00a3450-a-night hotel suite and that even if we could many of us wouldn't choose Las Vegas. I've been there at least once, and once is enough. Its gangster image has long since been cleaned up, and nowadays it's more of a Disneyland for borderline grownups, a money-making machine in the Nevada desert, plastic-wrapped sin for all the family. Even the swimming pools are too shallow to swim in.</p> <p>Never mind. Harry's 27 now \u2013 plenty old enough to vote and to fight for the Queen \u2013 and he wanted to go there on holiday with his Etonian posse. If his salary as an army captain and Richard Branson's Caribbean hospitality didn't pay all the bills, I'm sure Granny will see him right and that the taxpayer will help her out, much as we all help pay those Branson bills for the train set.</p> <p>Scandalous, isn't it? As one prurient American TV host whom I spotted on YouTube put it with fake piety: \"Harry's brother is saving lives as a helicopter pilot in Wales\" while he's partying in Vegas. The presenter was grinning at the time.</p> <p>I gave up looking for the grainy shots of the naked royal. I'm assured they're online if you look hard enough, but who cares. It's hardly worth the trouble navigating one's way through the nudge-nudge and the \"show us the crown jewels, Harry\" uproar of all those sites trying to make a buck out of TMZ's little scoop. So many awful people, most of them tanned and overweight. Welcome to Vegas, where the casino food and drink is often very cheap \u2013 free even \u2013 provided you're a gambler or a young woman.</p> <p>We could talk all day about behaviour appropriate to a young royal, third in line to Granny's throne, not to mention that of an army officer \u2013 you're an officer wherever you are and should set a good example, the Telegraph quotes a colonel as saying. But not even he can keep a straight face for long. Young officers are just that, they don't stay at home knitting, he goes on to admit.</p> <p>It's so easy to get pompous about this, isn't it? Chippy to the end, the Sun protests that it's not part of the fake outrage and it's the posher papers (I think it means the Mail, which has five pages on the subject) that are getting worked up. The dear old Guardian provides a prim 500 words, tucked away on an inside page. The Times has a double-page spread, and the FT once again shields its readers from the harsh realities of unequal modern Britain.</p> <p>No, I haven't forgotten the privacy issue that is first cousin to the censorship issue. Prince Charles \"bans\" nude pics, the Mail tells its readers. Actually no, he just got a legal flunky to remind the press and broadcasters of assorted media codes on individual privacy and human rights. The royal Fitztightly chappie may even have murmured the word \"Leveson\" down the phone for Fleet Street's more knuckle-dragging executives. (I wonder if Sir Brian has ever taken Lady Leveson to check out the eye candy in Las Vegas?)</p> <p>So the mobile shots are not to be seen in the mainstream UK media. Is this an outrage, a violation of our Magna Carta rights? Of course not, but some of the people saying so will also say the prince's behaviour was immature and deplorable. Having it both ways? Welcome to Britain, where newspapers that deplore the rampant exploitation of sex in our society \u2013 I name no names, Paul Dacre \u2013 serve up a generous dollop of prurient filth most days of the week and sell a lot of copies in the process. As for their websites, don't ask. They don't.</p> <p>As the papers are keen to remind us, Harry has been in plenty of scrapes before: drinks, drugs, swastikas, pretty girls \u2013 though he also won a place to train in the US as an Apache helicopter pilot, which apparently is very exacting work. They don't let boys play with such expensive toys if they think they'll crash them. He also exudes an easy charm, the kind of talent money can't buy, as he showed in his enjoyably silly race with Usain Bolt during a successful \u2013 and notably informal \u2013 royal tour of Jamaica.</p> <p>So I prefer to frame the question differently: when you heard of Prince Harry's latest antics \u2013 all those bikini-clad girls, the swimming race with another Olympic gold medallist, Ryan Lochte (Lochte's chums apparently held his feet to help Harry), the etiquette of strip billiards \u2013 did you frown or laugh?</p> <p>I laughed. Perhaps the ever-dutiful Queen, who gave us a rare glimpse of the royal sense of humour by participating in that stylish Olympic gag with 007, laughed too. We all need cheering up. That's why Boris Johnson, the clown who got elected, got re-elected. The Las Vegas incident was very Boris.</p> <p>Of course it's all silly and possibly undignified. But Harry strikes me as likable. A bit wild, though not in the league of royal princes of the past. Their antics were both much more private and unpleasant. Think Edwards VII and VIII, think all the sons of poor, decent George III, their misconduct \u2013 the women, gambling, spending \u2013 lampooned mercilessly by James Gilray and his cartooning cohort, their carriages booed in the street.</p> <p>And yet and yet, the two Edwards were popular, the latter absurdly so before he ratted and married Wallis Simpson. Who would you prefer to sit next to on a bus, Prince Charles or Prince Harry? Is Shakespeare's Harry a more attractive character than Henry IV, his care-worn dad? Will such incidents as Nude Harry improve the monarchy's chances of survival? Or will our hereditary presidency succumb to a sternly republican one when Granny leaves the stage?</p> <p>It's impossible to predict. But meanwhile the Las Vegas saga is surely too funny to resist. There's Harry reportedly sidling up to a member of the royal protection squad (sic) and muttering something about protecting him from Facebook and Twitter \u2013 too late, Harry! \u2013 and the whole question of what exactly royal protection officers are protecting their charges from at a nude party in a Las Vegas hotel suite (and how). The royal soap opera needs Harry's storyline. It's part of the constitutional mix.</p>",

  "<p>The A-level and GCSE season is an incredibly stressful time with the pressure of getting the necessary grades for college, sixth form or university entry and then dealing with the consequences if it hasn't all gone to plan.</p> <p>Not only that but making such big career and study choices at a relatively young age can have other risks. OPP's research shows that 35% of students would not choose their course if they had to make the decision again.</p> <p>To help you make the best possible decision and get it right first time, there are a number of avenues that you could explore.</p> <p><strong>Get under your skin</strong></p> <p>In America, personality assessments are often used at high school and in college to help students choose the careers and courses best suited to them. In mainstream UK schools these indicators are not widely used. There is evidence, however, that if they were to become the norm here too, students leaving the education system would be better equipped to enter the world of work, and have a firmer understanding of what they can offer employers and what they will get out of their chosen field.</p> <p>There are a number of psychometric assessments available that are scientifically robust and can support students' decision-making. Most are usually completed by answering a series of multiple choice questions and result in a feedback report which is yours to keep. The findings can provide a good foundation on which to base decisions around the best subjects or career paths to follow.</p> <p>Assessments, such as the <a href=\"http://www.opp.eu.com/psychometric_instruments/16pf/Pages/default.aspx?gclid=CJS4-t-j_bECFYcPfAodFWwAPw\" title=\"\">16PF personality questionnaire</a>, maps a personality according to the business skills that employers are looking for. It specifically identifies personality-based strengths and challenges, interests and work styles that can help students maximise their fit with an academic course and future career goals.</p> <p>Understanding areas such as how you relate to others, your thinking style, and how structured you like to be might encourage you to explore job sectors or roles that you had not even considered before.</p> <p><strong>It's not always what you think</strong></p> <p>According to OPP's research about 18% of people make career and study choices based on what they think they need to do to get into their chosen profession. This is not always necessarily in line with reality.</p> <p>Entry into a job or sector is not always restricted to one route. Unless you are planning to study something like medicine, for which there is a set career path and obvious study course, you will often find that people enter a role or industry from different study disciplines and some may have taken vocational training or an apprenticeship rather than going into higher education.</p> <p><strong>The real deal</strong></p> <p>Getting a real understanding of what the job you may be interested in actually entails on a daily basis is one of the most important things you can do as there is normally a mismatch between perception and reality.</p> <p>Research potential jobs online, offer yourself up for work experience, and contact the relevant industry body to see if you can speak to someone currently in the position.</p> <p>Be aware that some sectors have multiple strands, for example criminal, occupational, and clinical psychology or employment, property and family law. Even though they each sit within the fields of psychology and law respectively, they will be very different and suit different personality types. Once you understand your personality more, research the area that is right for you.</p> <p><strong>Employability</strong></p> <p>Despite the fact that there are lots of graduates looking for work, some employers are still unable to find people who demonstrate the right skills. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development reported that approximately 75% of organisations had noticed an <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CE8QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cipd.co.uk%2FNR%2Frdonlyres%2F3103F1EB-14FA-48AF-BA0F-B446A7F82C6D%2F0%2F5250_RTP_survey_report.pdf&amp;ei=EOQ1UOn9Asi_0QXsuYH4DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHnDdsO0G-oqySMO3mPSa3CjYUUpw\" title=\"\">increase in the number of unsuitable applicants</a>. This could be down to the fact that applicants are not researching positions effectively before applying or are not articulating their suitability for the role well enough.

If you are choosing subjects to study, then choose carefully, after looking at what is suited to you and what will help you get where you want to be.

  "<p>In this concise but extremely ambitious book, the Oxford historian David Priestland sets himself the task of taking the long view of the financial crisis that afflicts the world today. His argument is&#xa0;that the year 2008, when the credit crunch began, is as important as 1917, the year of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, or&#xa0;1945, when the second world war came to an end. Four years on, the crisis shows no sign of coming to an end, and&#xa0;political systems, economies and societies seem in a state of disarray \u2013 even looming collapse.</p> <p>How has all this come to pass? Why have we got to such a crisis? Such questions, Priestland suggests, can only be answered with the help of history, \"the&#xa0;only kind of guide we have to the future\". If the crisis has done one thing, he suggests, it has been to discredit the simplistic view of history that recognises in it nothing but progress towards a liberal, free-market, capitalist, democratic present and future. Capitalism comes in many forms, and if the recent development of China shows anything, it is that democracy doesn't have to come with it. Historical change isn't impelled solely or even principally by the conflict between economically based classes, as Marx believed, or by the clash of ideologies, as the last of the great optimists, the American academic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/francis-fukuyama\" title=\"\">Francis Fukuyama</a>, assumed. In practice, both play a part. It makes more sense, says Priestland, to look not at the interaction of abstract forces but at the concrete competition for power between three major groups in society over the ages \u2013 or, as he calls them, \"castes\", each with its identity and purposes rooted in an ethos closely linked to occupation and social function.</p> <p>The first of these is the merchant caste, or in modern parlance, the capitalists, promoting the values of business competition and the market. The second is the soldier caste, originating in the warrior aristocracy of the feudal middle ages and emphasising heroism, aggression and discipline. The third is the sagely or clerical-intellectual caste, dating from the days of the monks in medieval Christian society and finding its present-day embodiment in the bureaucrat, the technocrat and the expert. Over the centuries, these three castes have struggled for supremacy over the broad mass of peasants and, more recently, workers. This struggle, he boldly declares, has been \"the locomotive of history\".</p> <p>When one or other of these castes becomes too dominant, crisis usually ensues and it is replaced by another. The dictatorial and hierarchical rule of the soldier caste is destroyed by defeat in over-ambitious military action; the hidebound and ossified rule of the sage caste leads to revolutionary uprisings designed to widen participation in the state; the unconstrained dominance of the merchant caste leads to economic instability and inequality, fuelling social conflict and sparking revolution.</p> <p>Most of Priestland's book is devoted to a narrative account of recent history seen in terms of the competition between these three castes. The focus here is on the inexorable rise of the merchant, beginning in England and the Netherlands in the 17th century, gathering pace and spreading geographically in the early industrial age, and coming temporarily to grief in the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Thoroughly discredited, the merchant caste gave way in a country like Germany to a modernised version of the rule of the warrior under the Nazis, in Soviet Russia to an unstable alliance of martial bureaucrats and ideologues under Stalin, in Scandinavia to the rule of Social Democratic sages keeping the warriors and merchants under their thumb.</p> <p>If the merchant caste was discredited by the Depression, the soldier caste lost its legitimacy after the vast catastrophe of the second world war, and for a while the Social Democratic model provided stability and progress. But this sagely rule got into trouble too, its bureaucratic dullness and elitism alienating women, youth, minorities and \"1960s creatives\", its managerial claims destroyed by its failure to control the economic crisis that followed the huge global oil price hikes of 1973-74. This allowed the merchant caste to make a comeback, which it did with a vengeance towards the end of the 20th century.</p> <p>Today, Priestland says, the merchant caste rules alone in the west. Wherever you look, you find it in charge. In the UK, Margaret Thatcher brought business values into the heart of government and there they have stayed. In the US, Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve unleashed an era of unbridled financial expansion. In Russia, the collapse of communism opened the way to a decade of free-for-all capitalist competition with huge fortunes being made by a few and a collapse in living standards suffered by the many. Everywhere, trade unions were vanquished, the public sector assaulted and diminished, while what was left of it was subordinated to commercial values.</p> <p>The destruction of New York's twin towers by Islamist terrorists led by Osama bin Laden (a warrior, according to Priestland, a sagely fanatic in the eyes of President George Bush) prompted the resurgence of the warrior ethos, represented most crudely by the US secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld (\"We've got to do Iraq,\" he said before the invasion: \"There just aren't enough targets in Afghanistan. We need to bomb something else to prove that we're, you know, big and strong and not going to be pushed around by these kind of attacks\").</p> <p>Yet the self-evident pointlessness of&#xa0;the Iraq war and the huge costs it incurred \u2013 human, political, financial \u2013 shoved the warrior ethos back into its box. Only in Russia, where the consequences of merchant rule were spectacularly awful, did the warrior caste come back to power, in the shape of Vladimir Putin. In the west, continued merchant rule brought \"economic insecurity, corrosive inequality and potential environmental catastrophe\", with unbridled and unregulated financial competition leading from 2008 onwards to unprecedented financial collapse, government indebtedness and political instability with no foreseeable end.</p> <p>Priestland's solution, predictably enough in a book coming from an Oxford don, is more sagely power. Yet there are few signs of this happening, and, drawing on the example of the 1930s, he warns darkly that \"the year 2008 has set the world on a course towards potential conflict, and the domestic and international forces that brought us the violence of the 1930s and 1940s are with us today\" \u2013 not least in a China that has close similarities with the kaiser's Germany in its synthesis of nationalism and merchant power, though it's clearly less militaristic.</p> <p>If sages are to be reinstated in positions of power, they need, according to Priestland, to forge alliances with others, above all with creative groups and with workers. Yet this is where his model begins to come apart, for these two elements in society remain shadowy figures in the background all the way through his book. He clearly believes in democracy, but by portraying history as a struggle between elites he takes it out of the picture, reducing the vast majority of people to passive objects of the ongoing fight for supremacy by their superiors. This is history from above with a vengeance. Moreover, by forcing so much into such a simple straitjacket of historical categories, he lets himself in for a whole range of dubious generalisations and obvious oversimplifications. Are we really ruled by merchants for example? Have the military in the US really been sidelined? Is China really like Wilhelmine Germany? At the end of almost every paragraph readers will surely feel the word \"but\" coming to their lips.</p> <p>Priestland is of course aware of the complexities of political structures, but he leaves himself too little space to explain how and why alliances between his castes occur, and how the different groups modify and intermingle their values and behaviour with those of the others; if he'd done that, then the detail would have submerged his schema out of existence. Nevertheless, it's a schema well worth pondering and reflecting on. And among the many contributions to the dissection of our current predicament, this is surely one of the most thought-provoking.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard J Evans is Regius professor of history at Cambridge.</p>",

The figures for English literature are 76.3% at grades A*-C compared with 78.4% last year. In all subjects, the number of entries achieving the A* grade is down 0.5%, while the number achieving A*-C is down 0.4% year-on-year \u2013 the first fall since the qualification was introduced in 1986. It comes after a series of changes to the GCSE system this year and new efforts by the exams regulator to curb grade inflation.</p> <p>Around 658,000 16-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their results on Thursday.</p> <p>The fall in English will leave many children disappointed and may affect their ability to take up places in sixth forms. A decline in English results is also critical for schools, which are judged on the proportion of pupils achieving five good GCSE passes including English and maths. Schools that fall below the government target \u2013 40% achieving five good grades with English and maths \u2013 face being closed or taken out of local authority control and converted into academies.</p> <p>Headteachers representing dozens of schools in England <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/22/english-gcses-marked-down-teachers\" title=\"\">have told the Guardian </a>that, in some cases, students had been marked down by an entire grade in English compared with the results teachers had predicted. Schools in Leeds and across London, Essex, Kent, Hampshire, Suffolk, Bedfordshire and Somerset have all reported problems with the English GCSE.</p> <p>The drop follows the introduction of a revised English exam and pressure on examiners from the exams regulator Ofqual, supported by the education secretary, Michael Gove, to curb grade inflation. Exam boards also say there has been a shift in the pattern of entry for English, with fewer candidates entering early, in winter. This means more lower-ability candidates have taken the exam in summer.</p> <p>However, schools say that grade boundaries have been shifted to make the exam harder to pass. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"The grade boundaries in English have been moved up on the C/D boundary, moved up substantially by about 10 or 18 marks. This has been done at the end of the course.</p> <p>\"A number of schools have had a serious effect on their 5 A*-C indicator. But it appears standards of achievement haven't changed one iota, it's just the way the standards of marking have changed. English is the key to all the professions, it's the key to university.\"</p> <p>Speaking before the publication of the results, chief executive of exams regulator Ofqual <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jul/02/0levels-exams-regulator-profile\" title=\"\">Glenys Stacey</a> denied there had been any effective grade deflation this year to counteract years of rising results.</p> <p>She told Radio 4's Today programme: \"Our job is \u2013 as you know \u2013 to make sure that exam results are right, the grades are right, and so what we have done this year and indeed last year actually is to hold the line on standards steady, so that if the qualification and the type of student taking the exam are broadly the same the results will be broadly the same.</p> <p>\"Any differences in results, in English or in other subjects, will reflect the differences in the make up of the group taking the exam in terms of the number of their abilities or indeed this year, differences in the qualification system.\"</p> <p>She added: \"This year we have seen differences in the qualification itself and the students taking it. Having said that I'm not expecting to see a 10% reduction in English results across the board.\"</p> <p>This year's results also show that it is the first time the A*-C pass rate has fallen in the 24-year history of GCSEs. The exams were first taught in 1986, with the first exams taken in 1988. They reveal that:</p> <p>\u2022 In maths, 58.4% of entries got at least a C grade, down from 58.8% in 2011, and 15.4% got A*-A, compared to 16.5% last summer;</p> <p>\u2022In science, 60.7% got A*-C grades, down from 62.9% and 9.8% got A*-A, down from 11.6% in 2011. There is a new and more demanding science qualification this year, examiners say.</p> <p>\u2022 Girls have significantly outperformed boys at A*, with 8.7% of girls' entries achieving this grade compared with 6% of boys. Girls have also outperformed boys in terms of grades at A*-C.</p> <p>\u2022 In biology, physics and chemistry, girls outperform their male classmates at A* and A grades even though more boys than girls take these subjects.</p> <p>\u2022 There has also been a rise in entries for history and geography. Religious studies also continues to grow in popularity.</p> <p>\u2022 There is a 10% increase in the number of candidates taking Spanish, but entries in French and German both dropped. Entries for other modern languages rose to around 29,800 from just over 26,000 last year. There were significant increases, in percentage terms, in Arabic, Chinese, Persian, Portuguese and Italian.</p> <p>\u2022 The ten most popular subjects, in order, are mathematics, English, science, English literature, additional science, design &amp; technology, religious studies, history, geography, and art and design.</p> <p>Michael Turner, director of the Joint Council for Qualifications, said: \"These are a good set of results and students and teachers should be pleased with what they have achieved. It will be interesting to see if this year's rise in students taking Spanish and the rate of decline slowing in French and German is the beginning of a trend that will see more young people studying languages.\"</p>",
  "<p>So you got the gig as a member of the jury on the Apple-Samsung trial. It's been a blast so far: big names such as, well, perhaps not, but Phil Schiller, Apple's longtime head of marketing has testified, and Scott Forstall, head of the iPhone and iPad software division, as well as members of Apple's design division. Samsung has also had designers on hand, though more of the time has been spent with expert witnesses.</p> <p>Now comes the tough part, though. The judge is winding up and you have to decide on the merits of the cases of the two companies in front of you. The judge has given you a briefing note that is (we kid you not) 109 pages long. Even the paper on which you're meant to write your verdict is 20 pages long, consisting of 33 questions, for which there is a literally astronomical number of possible permutations if you were to answer at random.</p> <p>Luckily, you've got the Guardian's guide to help you with your decision. </p> <p>The decision is going to make an enormous difference, and will be heard around the world. The two companies between them control about half of the world's smartphone market; Samsung has more than half of the Android smartphone market; the two collect the majority of the profits and revenues in the smartphone market; Apple is Samsung's largest customer, and Samsung is Apple's largest supplier. </p> <p>This is an unusual case because it's not one-way traffic. Apple is accusing Samsung of violating patents on how a number of its phones work, and also of creating products intentionally designed to look like the iPhone and iPad so as to tempt buyers into thinking they're the same thing. </p> <p>But Samsung is accusing Apple of infringing a number of its patents, particularly relating to 3G (\"UMTS\") standard which is used in the US and Europe on millions of phones by using the technology without a licence.</p> <p>OK. Deep breath. Here's how to work through the list.</p> <h2>1) Start at Samsung's end of the case</h2> <p>Its claims are, in comparison, pretty simple to figure out. Did Apple use the UMTS/3G patents without a licence? It certainly used them, because the codes are part of the 3G standard. But Apple says that by using Intel chips which had licensed the patents from Samsung, it is protected by \"patent exhaustion\" (you can't charge someone twice for using the same patent); and that Samsung's pricing, of about 2.75% of the device's price, is unreasonable use of its monopoly. </p> <p>Samsung says that although the Intel chips do use its 3G technology, they're designed and built in Germany and shipped to China \u2013 and the law requires that they be sold in the first place in the US for \"patent exhaustion\" to apply. So, is the meaning of \"sold\" where they're incorporated into an iPad or iPhone \u2013 or where Intel and Apple sign the contract for their inclusion in the devices? Apple's lawyer says the receipt lists \"California [Apple's HQ] and Chicago\". Decide, jurors. </p> <p>Samsung also says that Apple infringed three other patents: the use of email in a camera-equipped phone; bookmarking a photo in a camera-equipped phone's image gallery; multitasking on a mobile device so you can listen to music in the background. Apple says these are either invalid or not infringed. Samsung says they're valid, and infringed, and it deserves a payment (of about $200m). </p> <p>Answer those, and that's <strong>10 questions of 33 sorted out</strong>. You'll have to figure out how much, if anything, Apple or Samsung is entitled to damages from this part, but you can probably come back to it later.</p> <h2>2) Now figure out Apple's claims. Start with whether Samsung really copied the \"functions\"</h2> <p>Apple says that it patented a number of elements used in the iPhone and iPad \u2013 the \"rubber band\" effect when you try to scroll past the end of a list, the \"double-tap to zoom\" effect on the screen, the \"pinch and squeeze to zoom\", and the general shape of the iPad (the \"D'889\" patent). It says Samsung infringed them all with a number of phones and tablets. </p> <p>Samsung says they were either obvious, or that it didn't infringe them, or that there was already existing \"prior art\" that incorporated them. </p> <p>Decide, jurors \u2013 based on the many objects and prototypes that have been (in at least one case literally) wheeled into the courtroom. Apple or Samsung? And if you decide in Apple's favour, there's always the question of whether Apple actually suffered financial harm as a result. Did it lose sales?</p> <p>Oddly, one of the strongest pieces of evidence for both sides is a study Apple carried out, looking at why people bought a Samsung smartphone rather than an iPhone. It was a small study, with fewer than 100 respondents, but the most common reason was because people were on the wrong carrier \u2013 the iPhone was only sold on AT&amp;T's network until January last year \u2013 and so couldn't get an iPhone. So, jurors, did they get the Samsung because it looked a bit like, and behaved quite like, an iPhone? Or because they liked the phone? </p> <p>Get this sorted and <strong>you've answered another 11 of the 33 questions</strong>. </p> <h2>3) Figure out the \"trade dress\" stuff, which is where the real \"copying\" claims come in</h2> <p>\"Trade dress\" is a lawyer's phrase for \"what it looks like when you're far enough away not to spot minor differences\". It's a sort of \"first reaction\" thing. Calor Gas bottles have a distinctive shape and colour; if you tried to make a pressurised cooking gas container in the same shape and colour, its lawyers would doubtless grab you on a \"trade dress\" suit.</p> <p>Apple is claiming that Samsung attempted to fool the public (not the specialist public, but just the general, undiscerning public) by making a number of its smartphones look like the iPhone 3G and 3GS, and some of its tablets like the iPad. Were people confused by the appearance of the device in a shop to the extent that they bought one thinking it was the other? That would be proof absolute of trade dress confusion \u2013 but Apple doesn't even have to show that; only that people might <em>in general</em> have been confused about which is which. That is \"trade dress dilution\", and another 10 of the 33 questions relate to this.</p> <p>Apple had a good start on trade dress, with some data from Best Buy about people who had returned Galaxy Tabs because they had bought them thinking they were iPads. The idea that Samsung intentionally copied Apple's designs is one that Apple's lawyers pushed extremely hard during the case. They have produced internal documents in which Samsung staff talk about a \"design crisis\", minutely compare Samsung's icons with the iPhone's, talking of the difference being \"heaven and earth <strike> hell </strike>\". </p> <p>Apple's lawyers also showed the evolution of Samsung's icons pre- and post-iPhone \u2013 such as the symbol for the phone going from a grid of numbers (for a keypad) to the \"landline handset\" icon. (It even faces the same way.) Apple also says that Samsung was warned by Google in December 2010 not to make its tablet designs look too much like the iPad. A Samsung engineer who worked on the Galaxy Tab testified to not having heard about that \u2013 which Apple's lawyer used in his summing-up to suggest means Samsung executives kept information from its staff and \"let them keep copying\".</p> <p>Samsung's rebuttal is to say that it was working on touchscreen phones before the iPhone, and tablets before the iPad. The document was to gee up the troops, not an instruction to plagiarism. And some icon designs just work better than others. </p> <p>As to the \"trade dress\" issue, Samsung said that there are key differences in the appearance of the Galaxy Tab and the iPad (the former has a two-tone back, for example) and that anyone who turned a device on would know the difference at once. Apple, it said, is just trying to stifle competition \u2013 and the idea that if Samsung hadn't been there then all those people would have bought iPhones or iPads is just ridiculous; they would have bought another Android product at the same price as they paid for the Samsung product.<br>uchSo, jurors: did Samsung intentionally copy, or is Apple just trying to quash fair competition? On this hangs pretty much the whole case. This takes you to the last two questions (if you've done it our way, although they're 22 and 23 out of 33 on the list): how much money, if any, is Apple entitled to? </p> <p>The worst question of all? If the jury decides that Apple does deserve damages, then question 23 asks them to list precisely how much \u2013 for each of 28 smartphones and tablets. </p> <p>By now, after four weeks of argument and counter-argument, and who knows how much deliberation, they may just prefer to write a single number down.</p> <p><strong>Correction:</strong> the phrase in the Samsung document was \"heaven and earth\", not \"heaven and hell\".</p>",
  "<p>The UK's flush of enthusiasm over the Olympic Games continues and will be boosted again by the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/paralympics\">Paralympics</a>, but academics who study our national attitudes to sport do not expect it to last.</p> <p>Football will soon reassert its primacy because of the communal, team and 'clubby' nature of the game and its very long-standing structure, according to Dr Chris Stride of Sheffield university who created the <a href=\"http://www.offbeat.group.shef.ac.uk/statues/\">Sporting Statues Project.</a></p> <p>This has compiled a directory and 'biography' over over 100 sporting statues in the UK of which only five are of Olympians: Sir Steve Redgrave, <a href=\"http://www.matthewpinsent.com/\">Matthew Pinsent</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/feb/12/john-curry-olympic-gold\">John Curry</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-18971752\">Steve Ovett</a> from modern times, and <a href=\"http://www.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/home\">Eric Liddell </a>from the <em>Chariots of Fire </em>days in the 1920s. The contrast is striking with the evidence in ancient marble from Olympia in Greece, where the original games inspired an industry of statues portraying that favourite subject of the classical artist, the male nude.</p> <p>There is currently talk of statues in Sheffield and Edinburgh of Jessica Ennis and Sir Chris Hoy, but Stride is sceptical despite the success of the Royal Mail's golden pillarboxes and almost daily new stamps commemorating medal winners this year. He says: </p> <blockquote> <p>The lack of Olympian statues in the UK is ironic given the origins of sports statues in the ancient Greek Olympics but, for a statue project to succeed it requires a site and funding. Football clubs own land to site a statue upon and, at the higher echelons, a statue is a relatively small expense.</p> <p>The use of statues and other types of nostalgic branding in the commercialised world of Premiership Football is now well established. Even smaller clubs will often have a group of committed supporters willing to fundraise over a period of years to honour their childhood heroes.</p> <p>Conversely Olympic athletes are in the public eye for relatively brief periods and are not typically part of a larger sports organisation, so they do not have the same committed supporter base to campaign for a statue or raise money for one - nor do they have a regular home stadium where a statue would be placed. Even when they are suggested as statue subjects for a town or city centre site they may often be competing with other local heroes from all walks of life for the honour.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395083353\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2011/11/14/1321271004221/Sebastian-Coe-and-Steve-O-001.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett, knitted\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Ovett and Seb Coe got into knitwear.

After totting up the figures, Radio 4's More or Less has worked out that the deadliest fictional place in the world of deadly fictional places is Cabot Cove in Maine, home town of one Jessica Fletcher in Murder, She Wrote, which has 149 murders for every 100,000 people. Ystad, home of Swedish detective Wallander, is nipping at its heels, with 110 murders per 100,000. By comparison, Oxford, which is home to Inspector Morse and his sidekick Lewis, is positively boring, with a mere three murders for every 100,000, while Midsomer, of Murders fame, (where recent murders include the body of a tax inspector being found dumped in a barrel of cider and a local farmer brutally murdered on an ancient stone circle) has just 3.2 murders per 100,000. Handily, the Sun gives a few top tips for keeping safe if you ever find yourself in any of these places, including keeping an eye on your drink so no one can poison it and to never arrive in storm.

  "<p>Of all interactive entertainment genres, the fighting game seems to provoke the strongest sense of community and identity from its fan base. While first-person shooters attract a larger competitive audience, the likes of Street Fighter, Tekken and Virtua Fighter seem to inspire something more, something akin to a true subculture, with its own language, meeting places and sense of visual style.</p> <p>Publishers like Namco and Capcom are experts at capitalising on this, hence the \"We Are Tekken\" Instagram competition, which is running throughout August. UK gamers are being encouraged to send in snapshots of what Tekken means to them. The best images are then to be displayed at Shoreditch's Protein gallery from 13-16 September.</p> <p>The photos are pretty interesting, ranging from little pieces of Tekken art to photos of people playing the game.

We built a rover, so unless the rover roves we haven't accomplished anything.\"</p> <p>Theisinger said the mission had been going \"extremely well\" so far, reporting \"no anomalies or other issues\", with the exception of suspected damage to one of two wind sensors on the rover's weather station, most likely caused by pebbles striking the device.</p> <p>The site where Curiosity landed has been named Bradbury Landing, the team said, after science fiction writer Ray Bradbury. In his short story collection The Martian Chronicles, humans colonised Mars after fleeing a ravaged Earth. Bradbury, who died in June, would have turned 92 on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"This was not a difficult choice for the science team,\" said Michael Meyer, lead scientist of Nasa's Mars Exploration Program. \"Many of us and millions of other readers were inspired in our lives by stories Ray Bradbury wrote to dream of the possibility of life on Mars.\"</p> <p>The journey on Wednesday was described as \"very beautiful\" by lead driver Matt Heverly, who was behind the wheel for Curiosity's initial foray. \"I'm pleased to report that today Curiosity had her first successful drive on Mars,\" he told the news conference in Pasadena, California, to whoops and cheers.</p> <p>Heverly reported a \"fully functioning\" system on the rover. The conditions for driving had been kind too, the soil \"firm, great for mobility\". The key thing ascertained from the drive, Heverly said, was that the team had been able to \"do one full revolution of the drive actuators\", which power Curiosity's six wheels.</p> <p>\"We're very excited to have this milestone behind us. We can see that the system is performing very well.\"</p> <p>The first few weeks on Mars are set aside for performing various tests on Curiosity to check its cameras and various scientific instruments. It is also an opportunity for engineers to get used to using Curiosity's robotic arm, which is 2m long and weighs in at 30kg \u2013 much bigger and trickier to manoeuvre than the arms on the previous Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity.</p> <p>\"They're not in any rush \u2013 this mission is meant to last for two Earth years,\" said Peter Grindrod, a planetary scientist at University College London, who has been watching every move of the mission. \"The first few days are about: is everything in one piece, are the cameras working?\"</p> <p>The science experiments will start when the rover gets to its first place of interest, an area called Glenelg, about 400m away to the east of where it is now. Nasa scientists are also keen to analyse blast marks created on Mars's surface when the descent rockets moved away dust during the landing, revealing interesting-looking bedrock.</p> <p>The rover has already fired its laser into the landing site and taken pictures and data, but Nasa has not yet revealed any of the measurements. \"All the other rocks on the surface look like the Mars everyone knows from Viking through to Spirit,\" said Grindrod. \"The ones that have been revealed [at the blast marks] look like they might be slightly lighter toned and might suggest a different composition. The most interesting thing is that these don't look like rocks that are just sat on the surface and have ended up there, either from thrown out from a meteorite impact or having been delivered by erosion. These things look like they might be in situ, where they formed.\"</p> <p>Geologists can use in-situ rocks to ascertain a good idea of the history of that part of the planet \u2013 when it formed, for example, and in what conditions.</p> <p>It will take Curiosity around three weeks or more to travel to Glenelg and, along the way, Nasa scientists will be watching everything the rover sees, in case they spot anything interesting on the journey. It could be a year before Curiosity gets to its main mission: Mount Sharp.</p> <p>\"There's two main things that make Mount Sharp interesting,\" Grindrod said. \"It's five kilometres of layered rock, which are probably sediments. We're not sure how they are laid down but, on Earth, those layers are very good at revealing the environment in which they formed.\"</p> <p>Another factor in choosing where to land Curiosity was the chemistry scientists saw from orbit. \"Near the bottom there is evidence that water was around at some point in some form. If you go to the top, it's dry,\" said Grindrod.</p> <p>While Nasa's current Mars lander has barely started its operations, the space agency is already planning its next. Insight will travel to Mars in 2016 to investigate how the interior of the planet is different to that of Earth \u2013 in particular, is it solid or liquid? </p> <p>A liquid core on Earth drives a dynamo that creates a magnetic field around our planet. Mars does not have a magnetic field at the moment but scientists think it might have had one in its very early history. </p> <p>As the core died out and stopped moving, said Grindrod, the planet would have lost its magnetic field and, consequently, its protection from the damaging solar wind. The atmosphere would have been stripped away, explaining why it is so thin at the moment.</p> <p>\"That happened at the same time as the volcanoes were erupting, that the water turned acidic,\" said Grindrod. \"All these things happened at the same time, making Mars go from a life-friendly environment to a more life-unfriendly environment, all at the same time.\"</p>",
  "<p>If a single word dominates the recent white paper, <a href=\"http://caringforourfuture.dh.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Caring for our future</a>, it is \"quality\". The word is dotted throughout the white paper and an entire chapter is devoted to the concept.</p> <p>The white paper stresses the government's desire to drive continuous quality improvement in services. The health secretary, Andrew Lansley, for example, states in the foreword that \"the quality of care and support that people receive can vary considerably \u2026 And all too often, the system only grinds into action in response to a crisis, rather than acting quickly to prevent one.\"</p> <p>The white paper outlines a number of initiatives that seek to raise standards and quality. The government reinforces its belief in a market-based approach to continuous improvement, seeing informed and empowered service users (using their own money or a proxy such as a personal budget or direct payment) making choices which drive up quality and/or force poorer providers to improve or exit.</p> <p>But the key question is whether or not the initiatives in the white paper amount to a coherent strategy for quality. The truth is that most do not require legislation to be progressed and several have already been announced or are in train. For example, the role of regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is reconfirmed as being one of ensuring (and if necessary enforcing) compliance with essential standards of quality and safety.</p> <p>So the white paper contains few completely new ideas and, as such, the aspirations for better quality care are unlikely to be easily met by the proposals it contains.</p> <p>The fundamental problem is that the government fails to appreciate that driving continuous quality improvement requires, among other things, a consistent definition of high quality around which all parties can coalesce. There is also huge potential for the public to be confused about the roles of the key agencies in relation to quality.</p> <p>The government's role is to set the overarching policy and legal framework, provide funding, and ensure accountability. But while a consumerist approach \u2013 that is, giving users of social care and their families a greater role in the choice and standard of their care \u2013 is to be welcomed, it is short-sighted if it then means the government appears to play less of a strategic leadership role. Leadership in this respect is critical; each of the recent Winterbourne reports underlines this. But the message, loud and clear, is that it is for others to both assess and drive quality above the compliance level.</p> <p>For example, far from rationalising the number of organisations concerned with social care quality, there appears to be a trend towards increasing them. So, as well as established bodies like local councils, the CQC, Skills for Care, Scie (the Social Care Institute for Excellence) and TLAP (Think Local Act Personal), there are plans to involve or extend the remits of NHS Choices, Nice, HQIP (Healthcare Quality Improvement Programme) and Healthwatch. Only the government can address this issue of overlapping roles \u2013 not least because it controls the purse strings and the legislation governing many of them.</p> <p>There are organisations like Scie whose exclusive focus is social care and yet the task \u2013 and presumably funding \u2013 of developing a \"library of social care standards\" is given to Nice, a \"clinical\" excellence body. Then the government plans to invest in developing an ambitious web-based data portal on providers' quality profiles which it claims will \"support the production of independent quality ratings that are easy to understand\", though it's not clear how this is going to happen.</p> <p>Too many cooks spoil the broth, as the adage goes. I wonder who at the DH thinks it is a good idea to involve so many different and diverse agencies in delivering its quality strategy?</p> <p>Furthermore, the government will support and work with organisations developing websites that allow service user and families to feedback on practice and quality. For example, the government's portal, which is part of the NHS Choices website, sounds like an ambitious version of how CQC quality and risk profiles were originally presented. But these consumer-informing risk profiles have not developed into the quality improvement tool some envisioned, due in part to the relatively limited data flows in social care. The government's portal though sounds like a heavyweight industry in waiting and providers are concerned that it will add administrative burden with little real benefit for service users or families.</p> <p>It is important to note that many of the initiatives outlined in the white paper are voluntary and it is unclear how key features of the new architecture will work together. Take the Nice-produced quality standards, these will be aspirational statements of high-quality care while CQC-monitored essential standards are legally binding. But how will consumers and commissioners know which is which and whether services meet a relevant quality standard?</p> <p>And finally, there's an obvious but important note of caution about how you can drive up quality without significant investment. The detailed impact assessments accompanying the white paper suggest additional spending on quality and the workforce \u2013 a critical and central influencer of quality \u2013 of only some \u00a3140m over 10 years and only \u00a315.2m over the years 2012-13 and 2013-14. Such small sums are surely unlikely to be transformative, in a sector currently spending some \u00a316bn of public funds on adult social care.</p> <p>The longer I look at the white paper, the harder it is to see it as a coherent and compelling vision for driving continuous improvement. The best strategies are usually simple ones but the degree of structural complexity and competing systems these proposals introduce will be confusing and unhelpful to the public. Combine that with the fact that the proposals in Caring for our future present us with little that is new, the transformative vision of quality in social care that Lansley presents at the start of the white paper looks increasingly out of focus.</p> <p><strong> This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>When Julian Assange was first arrested, we were struck by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/08/wikileaks-rape-allegations-freedom-of-speech\" title=\"\">unusual zeal</a> with which he was being pursued for rape allegations.</p> <p>It seems even clearer now, that the allegations against him are a smokescreen behind which a number of governments are trying to clamp down on WikiLeaks for having audaciously revealed to the public their secret planning of wars and occupations with their attendant rape, murder and destruction.</p> <p>Justice for an accused rapist does not deny justice for his accusers. But in this case justice is being denied both to accusers and accused.</p> <p>The judicial process has been corrupted. On the one hand, the names of the women have been circulated on the internet; they have been trashed, accused of setting a \"honey trap\", and seen their allegations dismissed as \"not real rape\". On the other hand, Assange is dealt with by much of the media as if he were guilty, though he has not even been charged. It is not for us to decide whether or not the allegations are true and whether what happened amounts to rape or sexual violence \u2013 we don't have all the facts and what has been said so far has not been tested. But we do know that rape victims' right to anonymity and defendants' right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty are both crucial to a just judicial process.</p> <p>Swedish and British courts are responsible for how the women's allegations have been handled. As with every rape case, the women are not in charge of the case, the state is.</p> <p>Whether or not Assange is guilty of sexual violence, we do not believe that is why he is being pursued. Once again women's fury and frustration at the prevalence of rape and other violence, is being used by politicians to advance their own purposes. The authorities care so little about violence against women that they manipulate rape allegations at will, usually to increase their powers, this time to facilitate Assange's extradition or even rendition to the US. That the US has not presented a demand for his extradition at this stage is no guarantee that they won't do so once he is in Sweden, and that he will not be tortured as Bradley Manning and many others, women and men, have. Women Against Rape cannot ignore this threat.</p> <p>In over 30 years working with thousands of rape victims who are seeking asylum from rape and other forms of torture, we have met nothing but obstruction from British governments. Time after time, they have accused women of lying and deported them with no concern for their safety. We are currently working with three women who were raped again after having been deported \u2013 one of them is now destitute, struggling to survive with the child she conceived from the rape; the other managed to return to Britain and won the right to stay, and one of them won compensation.</p> <p>Assange has made it clear for months that he is available for questioning by the Swedish authorities, in Britain or via Skype. Why are they refusing this essential step to their investigation? What are they afraid of?</p> <p>In 1998 Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London following an extradition request from Spain. His responsibility for the murder and disappearance of at least 3,000 people, and the torture of 30,000 people, including the rape and sexual abuse of more than 3,000 women often with the use of dogs, was never in doubt. Despite a lengthy legal action and a daily picket outside parliament called by Chilean refugees, including women who had been tortured under Pinochet, the British government reneged on its obligation to Spain's criminal justice system and Pinochet was allowed to return to Chile. Assange has not even been charged; yet the determination to have him extradited is much greater than ever it was with Pinochet. (Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, whose request for extradition of Pinochet was denied, is representing Assange.) And there is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation_of_Ahmed_Agiza_and_Muhammad_al-Zery\" title=\"\">a history</a> of Sweden (and Britain) rendering asylum seekers at risk of torture at the behest of the US.</p> <p>Like women in Sweden and everywhere, we want rapists caught, charged and convicted. We have campaigned for that for more than 35 years, with limited success. We are even having to campaign to prevent rape victims being accused of making false allegations and imprisoned for it. Two women who reported visibly violent attacks by strangers were given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/aug/12/layla-jailed-after-reporting-sexual-assault\" title=\"\">two</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/09/gail-sherwood-jailed-campaigners\" title=\"\">three year</a> prison sentences.</p> <p>But does anyone really believe that extraditing Julian Assange will strengthen women against rape? And do those supporting his extradition to Sweden care if he is then extradited to the US and tortured for telling the public what we need to know about those who govern us?</p>",
  "<p>Irwell Valley chief executive Tom Manion certainly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2012/aug/15/tom-manion-reward-society-housing\" title=\"\">makes a bold claim</a>: \"If we want a happy, healthy and prosperous nation, we need the policies, tax incentives and penalties which promote these outcomes \u2026 we should stop devoting inordinate time and money dealing with people whose behaviour is inconsistent with a just and fair society\".</p> <p>Another critique of the ongoing banking scandal? A pop at our politicians? No. Manion is referring welfare recipients and social housing tenants, who find themselves in the firing line again, this time as a way of realising what is known as the \"reward society\".</p> <p>We can all agree that incentives have a role to play in housing management strategies to tackle rent arrears and voids. Many social landlords are already using <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/ uk-politics-16943729\" title=\"\">aspects of \"nudge\" theory</a> to modify the behaviour of tenants. But having read Manion's article more than once, I still have difficulty with some of the claims made for deploying incentives and the theoretical underpinning for his reward theory.</p> <p>By appealing to spending on welfare and the supposed \"low productivity\" derived from the \u00a3700bn public sector in the UK, Manion reduces the impact of his argument. First of all, the UK only spends \u00a3200bn on welfare as claimed, if the costs of pensions and other benefits to older people <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/apr/25/uk-public-spending-1963\" title=\"\">are included</a>.</p> <p>Benefits to non-pensioners are around half the \u00a3200bn quoted and the costs of unemployment are below 10% of the total welfare budget. What's more, the welfare benefit bill excluding pensions is only just over 6% of the UK's GDP, which is only marginally higher than a decade ago. The fastest growing item is housing benefit as a direct result of ballooning private sector rents and social landlords' loan repayments to the financial sector.</p> <p>In terms of productivity, Manion chooses to highlight the Scandinavian countries as ones to emulate without acknowledging that these countries have generally more generous welfare states than the UK. Clearly, our state can offer more help to unemployed people, especially the young, in finding work and there may be a role here for rewarding positive behaviour. However, I would argue that rewards will have only marginal effects at a time of high unemployment and double-dip recession.</p> <p>A further issue with the reward society applied to housing is using performance indicators to demonstrate the effects of the theory. As all who work in housing know, the factors that affect rent paying, churn and tenant satisfaction are complex. More disadvantaged tenants with homes located in more deprived neighbourhoods make the housing management task more difficult. Housing management within a context of higher levels of social exclusion has a <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/regulation/value-for-money-call-queried/6523174.article\" title=\"\">monetary and performance cost</a> too.</p> <p>Equally, tenant behaviour and collecting data to capture it is difficult and is highly contingent upon collection methods, particularly for tenant satisfaction. So claims for the success of rewards need to be isolated from other policies and trends.</p> <p>If rewards work, why \u2013 having handed out \u00a31.3tn to the financial sector in corporate rewards for bank failure after years of regulatory featherbedding \u2013 has there been so <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/12/reality-check-banking-bailout\" title=\"\">little behavioural change</a>?</p> <p>Let's stop aiming the spotlight at those at the bottom of the pile and recognise that <a href=\"http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resource/the-spirit-level\" title=\"\">yawning inequality</a> in the last three decades has been the reason for the growth in \"benefit dependency, incarceration, divorce, single parenthood, obesity and deaths from alcohol\", not an unproductive welfare state.</p> <p><em>Kevin Gulliver is director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.humancity.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Human City Institute</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest job vacancies</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>This month eight NHS trusts were warned by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/17/nhs-private-patients-overcharge-oft-warning\" title=\"\">anti-competitive behaviour over the way they run their private patient units</a> (PPUs).</p> <p>Earlier this year, a whistleblower approached the OFT to highlight potential concerns about commercially sensitive information being exchanged between members of the Southern Region Private Healthcare Association. The OFT has now closed its file, as the trusts in question have given voluntary assurances that they will no longer exchange commercially sensitive information relating to the prices they charge private patients.</p> <p>The OFT has not disclosed details about the nature of the information that was exchanged, but it is clearly sending a strong signal to all NHS trusts and foundation trusts that they must comply with competition law while engaging in private healthcare services. The private healthcare sector is currently the subject of an in-depth investigation by the Competition Commission and the OFT (and Monitor) is keen to ensure there is a truly level playing field between PPUs and providers from the private and voluntary sector.</p> <p>The OFT's announcement comes at an interesting time for the healthcare sector, following the introduction of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. As the bill passed through parliament, there was much debate about how competition law should apply in the public healthcare sector. In reality, competition law already applies to NHS entities where they perform commercial activities and certainly for private healthcare activities such as PPUs, so the real question was not whether competition law applies to such activities (it does) but how it should be enforced in practice.</p> <p>This raises some interesting questions in the context of public healthcare, where it is entirely legitimate and important for NHS entities to cooperate with each other. What these entities cannot do, however, is allow this legitimate co-operation to spill over into anti-competitive activity. Where this behaviour infringes competition law, it can attract significant financial penalties of up to 10% of turnover.</p> <p>The OFT's decision to close the file at this stage is deliberately lenient, but it lets the NHS trusts know that more serious forms of anti-competitive activity, such as discussions with other hospital trusts (or private providers) which could affect their strategies or pricing for private patient services, or which could share territories, services or types of customer between them, will be punished in future. The OFT is writing to all NHS trusts and foundation trusts that operate PPUs urging them to provide training to their staff on the importance of complying with competition law.</p> <p>Monitor is expected to issue guidance over the coming months, in line with its new responsibilities for competition law enforcement under the act. These guidelines will shed further light on the approach it intends to adopt in balancing the need for integrated patient care, which requires close co-operation between providers along the pathway, and competition between providers to drive better outcomes for patients. Whatever approach Monitor takes, it is clear that the competition authorities are increasingly interested in healthcare and we are likely to see more activity in this sector.</p> <p><em>Bruce Kilpatrick is head of the city competition law team at Addleshaw Goddard and an expert in competition in the healthcare sector</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-healthcare-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers. </strong></p>",

  "<p>Some landlords and lettings agents are breaching the law by issuing contracts preventing tenants from switching energy supplier to get a cheaper deal.</p> <p>Research by comparison website <a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com\" title=\"uSwitch website\">uSwitch.com</a> showed that 3% of people who rent privately have been unable to switch gas or electricity provider because their contract won't allow it, while 7% have been told by their landlord that they cannot switch.</p> <p>A rental contract is allowed to stipulate that tenants ask a landlord before switching energy supplier, but it cannot refuse permission to switch altogether.</p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading states: \"The tenant should have the choice of supplier, although he may be required to keep the landlord informed of any change and to return the account to the original supplier at the end of the tenancy.\" It adds that landlord's consent cannot be \"unreasonably withheld or delayed\".</p> <p>The uSwitch figures suggest as many as one in 10 landlords may be in breach of the law. A large number of tenants also appear to be unaware of their rights. Fewer than a third of private renters (31%) were aware they could switch energy suppliers, subject to their rental contract, while 28% think being a tenant makes it more difficult for them to switch.</p> <p>Some lettings agents appear to have struck deals with utilities companies that see the latter pay commission if tenants use their services.</p> <p>A website run by a property management company in Hull has a list of potential questions tenants might ask, including \"Can I choose my own utility provider?\". It answers: \"We are working closely with a company called Utility Warehouse to ensure our tenants receive the best service and market prices for their utilities and to enable all our properties to be with one provider. As part of your agreement we ask you to join the Utility Warehouse Club. The cost for this service is \u00a31.76 per month, however, the benefits received compensate for this minimal fee.\"</p> <p>Landlords can, however, add specific requirements into an assured shorthold tenancy (AST) contract concerning changing utility providers, especially where switching supplier could result in alterations to the property, said Chris Norris, head of policy at the <a href=\"www.landlords.org.uk/\" title=\"NLA website\">National Landlords Association</a>.</p> <p>\"For example, if tenants are installing new meters or phone cables, damage could occur to the property. It is wise to ask the landlord before any work is carried out,\" he said. \"If an energy supplier needs to install a pre-paid box to the property, it's also important the landlord is aware.\"</p> <p>Tenants who do want to switch should look out for early exit fees on energy tariffs, uSwitch said, especially where the tenancy is for a period of less than a year.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government should urgently analyse the impact of its new tax rules on developing countries, MPs on the House of Commons international development committee said on Thursday.</p> <p>Depending on the results of the analysis, the government should consider whether to drop its proposals from its finance bill, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/news/tax-in-developing-countries-report/\" title=\"\">a committee report, Tax in Developing Countries</a>, said.</p> <p>In the 2012 finance bill, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/06/uk-tax-concessions-cost-developing-countries\" title=\"\">government proposed a relaxation of its anti-tax haven laws, or controlled foreign companies (CFC) rules</a>. Designed to discourage UK-owned corporations from using tax havens, the rules have applied to British-owned companies operating either in the UK or overseas.</p> <p>If a UK-owned company reports profits in a country with lower corporate taxes than the UK, the government is able to impose an extra tax charge on the company to \"make up the difference\". Consequently, as things stand, profits moved from developing countries into tax havens still incur tax at UK rates.</p> <p>Under the new rules, due to come into force in January, the UK will only impose this extra levy if the profits have been shifted from the UK. Profits moved from developing countries into tax havens will incur tax at the tax-haven rate, rather than the UK rate, so the incentive to shift profits will be significantly higher.</p> <p>NGOs strongly oppose changes to the CFC rules. ActionAid estimates poor countries <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/103143/the_problem_with_a_new_loophole.html\" title=\"\">may lose up to \u00a34bn in tax revenues</a>. The Treasury does not accept the estimate, but has acknowledged there would be a cost to developing countries. \"We do not know if this estimate is correct, but the government cannot legitimately refute the \u00a34bn figure unless it is prepared to conduct its own analysis,\" said Malcolm Bruce, chairman of the committee. \"That is what we are urging it to do.\"</p> <p>The committee urged the Department for International Development (DfID) to take into account the development impact of tax and fiscal policy. It also said there should be an administrative or legislative requirement for the government to assess new primary and secondary UK tax legislation against its likely impact on poverty reduction and revenue-raising in developing countries.</p> <p>The report highlights the importance of tax collection in developing countries, noting that tax revenues represent a significantly more predictable and sustainable source of revenue than aid. The committee looked at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/feb/29/uk-urged-support-zambia-tax-multinationals\" title=\"\">Zambia, which is heavily dependent on copper mining, as a case study</a>. To test allegations that companies are not making their audited accounts available to the public, the committee suggested that DfID should request access to the accounts of some of Zambia's main corporations.</p> <p>The committee praised DfID's work on taxation, citing a successful programme in Rwanda, where revenues collected increased sixfold over 10 years. It recommended that DfID increase its technical assistance work with the national revenue authorities of developing countries.</p> <p>The committee also said UK-owned multinationals should be required to report their accounts on a country-by-country rather than aggregate basis, which would enable irregularities to be more easily detected. Requiring tax authorities to exchange information automatically with their counterparts would also constitute a strong deterrent against cross-border tax evasion, the report said. The committee urged the government to enact unilateral legislation to achieve both objectives.</p> <p>NGOs strongly endorsed the committee's findings. \"It's fantastic to see there is a strong, cross-party consensus that collecting tax effectively is vital for poor countries to escape aid dependency and poverty,\" said Joseph Stead, senior economic justice adviser at Christian Aid. \"For the sake of the billions of people harmed by tax dodging, the prime minister must act on the committee's powerful recommendations. Next year's UK presidency of the G8 provides a global platform to demonstrate this leadership.\"</p> <p>Lucia Fry, head of policy at ActionAid, said: \"The international development committee has rightly recognised just how fundamental tax revenues are for developing countries. Tax avoidance is now a major global concern, and the UK needs to take into account the impact of its own tax regime on the world's poorest countries.\"</p> <p>The Treasury, however, said the CFC rules protected UK tax revenues and were never designed to protect other countries' tax revenues.</p> <p>\"Their reform will encourage investment and drive growth in the UK,\" it said in a statement. \"It is not sustainable for developing countries to protect their revenue using our tax rules, a much better way is to build their capacity and capability to collect the tax that they are due.\"</p> <p>The Treasury also questioned the feasibility of analysing the impact of the tax changes.</p> <p>\"Any assessment of the impact of CFC reform on developing countries would need to primarily focus on the nature of, and interaction of companies with, the tax regimes in developing countries. It would be an assessment not of our tax rules, but of the tax rules of other countries,\" said a Treasury spokesperson. \"Preparing an assessment of the impacts across a range of countries is inherently difficult and uncertain and the government does not think that such an assessment is feasible.\"</p>",
  "<p>In spite of its countless champions in government, social enterprise remains a sticky subject.</p> <p>I believe market-based income generation can be a crucial means for some organisations to support their work \u2013 namely when the business plan is closely linked with fulfilling the an organisation's mission.</p> <p>But there's an awful lot in the social enterprise world coming from the other end of the spectrum. I've called this \"Corporate Social Responsibility 2.0\" \u2013 or a veneer for profit-making businesses to portray themselves in a more positive light, without changing deeper unethical practices.</p> <p>It is \"enterprise\" with a sprinkling of \"social\" for PR purposes.</p> <p>That might sound too cynical. I don't want to imply that this is necessarily a malevolent effort, but that profit-making companies must do more than channel a small portion of their profits into a mostly removed charitable cause if they want to be taken seriously as a social venture.</p> <p>While many businesses turn profits through deeply unethical practices and then make sizable donations to charity, social enterprise should not be the \"carbon trading of social good\", by which I mean buying the right to keep doing something which is fundamentally wrong.</p> <p>This means thinking about how every part of what the organisation does, inside and outside its walls, aligns with the values it espouses. How is it making money? What impact do these activities have on the environment? On people involved in them, directly or indirectly?</p> <p>But there's a deeper question which is hardly limited to social enterprises, applying to so many of our more traditional charities and social change organisations. Do we believe our methods as much as we believe in what we do? I believe we should.</p> <p>Are our management structures, reporting processes, communication methods, individual behaviours and relationships with colleagues, reflective of the values we want to see more of in the world?</p> <p>In my experience with social enterprises, charities, NGOs, and campaigning organisations, this is often not the case. So many socially-focused institutions have taken industrial-era corporate organising blueprints and attempted to apply them to a range of social aims. But these systems were not designed to help create a better world, just a more profitable one.</p> <p>My friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBarasi\" title=\"\">Paul Barasi</a> often jokes about the number of social change organisations that use words such as engagement, participation, or involvement in their Twitter bios, yet who only follow newspapers' and politicians' accounts, and who don't communicate with people who tweet them. This makes for a relatively superficial, but also quite stark, disconnect between purpose and practice.</p> <p>More fundamentally, countless organisations promote ideas about democracy and egalitarianism, yet hold most decisions as high up the organisational command chain as possible, not trusting those doing the work to understand how best to do it.</p> <p>Or the many organisations that aim to improve relationships \u2013 whether personal or institutional ones \u2013 yet are deeply adversarial workplaces, where honest and open dialogue is distorted by accountability systems and management practices that promote the opposite ways of working with colleagues.</p> <p>Such contradictions have given rise to the first ever <a href=\"http://www.concretesolutions.org.uk/?p=1317\" title=\"\">More Like People Action Week</a>, a spur-of-the-moment initiative, happening right now, to remind us how people how don't wear organisational hats, nevertheless manage to organise. As Paul tweeted me on Sunday when he suggested the idea: \"It's about one small action you can take this week to make your workplace a bit more human.\"</p> <p>This is similar to what happens in communities when people come together for a common aim and figure out what to do about it at the pub, or around someone's kitchen table. It is also what happens online when we randomly connect with others concerned with the same social problem, and multiply our individual voices in the process.</p> <p>It also has similarities with the autonomy of joining an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/occupy-movement\" title=\"\">Occupy camp</a>, or a <a href=\"http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Uncut</a> action, knowing that what you do is up to you, and that you can find your own path to making a difference, as part of a bigger movement.</p> <p>What each of these examples have in common is that we come to them as ourselves, not as a professional or whatever our job title calls us, and we do things in the ways we want to do them, not through established formal systems that control us, and limit our abilities.</p> <p>And there's no reason these notions can't be a part of our working lives.</p> <p>Organisational culture isn't dictated from above, like so many policies; it is the cumulative result of how each of us who are a part of it chooses to engage with our work and with each other.</p> <p>If we don't feel our organisational culture is living the values we'd like it to, what can we do to improve it? We each have the opportunity to help make it a bit better, which is what this week is all about.</p> <p>What can you do differently this week to help your social change organisation to be more human? It might be about how you relate to a difficult colleague. Can you focus on hearing them, rather than proving them wrong? It might be about how you hold a meeting. Could you let conversation flow, and drop the formal agenda?. Alternatively it might be about how you make decisions. Can you involve more colleagues' opinions? Or put it out as a question on your social media channels?</p> <p>But it's up to you. And if you share your action on Twitter using the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\" title=\"\">#MoreLikePeopleWeek</a> hashtag, or add a comment about it to the blog below, you might just inspire someone else to take a step to make their organisation a bit more human too.</p> <p><em>Liam Barrington-Bush is a (normally UK-based) facilitator, consultant, and co-founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.concretesolutions.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Concrete Solutions</em></a><em>.

  "<p>I interviewed Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, this week.</p> <p>Here's a transcript.</p> <p>On the future of qualifications:</p> <blockquote> What's very important for me is securing a vocational pathway alongside the academic pathway that exists now. <br>The big concern that I've got is that we are still not addressing what people describe as the other 50%. <br>We've rightly been expanding higher education. Getting more young people from a working class background into higher education should be a priority but we need to have that alongside good quality vocational education. <br>I certainly welcome the strengthening of higher level apprenticeships, the requirement on FE colleges with regard to English and maths. <br>We need to go further on English and maths, we are examining this as part of the policy review, requiring some English and maths learning between the ages of 16 and 18. I don't think its just about retaking for those who haven't achieved at GCSE. <br>We've seen the usual stuff from the Tories about <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2190753/Mickey-Mouse-subjects-taken-90-pupils-Soft-courses-axed-league-tables.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">Mickey Mouse subjects</a>. If you look into the detail of some of the qualifications removed or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jan/31/vocational-qualifications-stripped-league-tables\" title=\"\">downgraded</a>, there's a real risk of some good quality qualifications - in areas like engineering, IT - these qualifications being downgraded as well. <br>What we attempted with the diplomas, including the engineering diploma was to provide a rigorous and challenging course linked to employers. We were starting to get to the point where we had a high quality rigorous option at 14. The Tories ripped that up. There's no sign of a credible replacement for it. <br>The key is that we don't fall into the trap of saying there's one route for some people at 14, a different route for other young people. We need a broad education that is high quality, has English and maths. We can learn from some of the countries that do this better than we do currently, certainly Germany, certainly the Netherlands, have succeeded in giving practical subjects the kind of status they haven't had in this country, and have 14 to 15-year-olds doing a mix of academic subjects and vocational options. [Giving examples of high quality vocational options] There are obviously high quality courses like engineering, areas like construction, [if you're] getting it right with ICT, this is not a soft option by any means. <br>Of course knowledge is important, but that must not be at the expense of skills; communication skills, team working skills should be reflected in all qualifications. <br> </blockquote> <p>The playing fields row and obligations on academies:</p> <blockquote> I've always believed in schools having independence and flexibility. I believe in school autonomy, but I think there's a certain basic entitlement parents and children expect of a state funded school. The national curriculum [for example] should apply to academies and free schools. <br>The government has removed the minimum space requirements for outside space, [and] when challenged, said it doesn't matter because all these decisions have to go to the secretary of state. The problem is that the secretary of state has overturned [the advice of the independent panel] five times. <br>For all state-funded schools, there should be a minimum expectation of the amount of time spent on sport. <br> </blockquote> <p>On teaching:</p> <blockquote> When you look at what matters most in terms of the differences between schools, it's the quality of the teaching. <br>There's a specific proposal in the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/education-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/attracting-training-and-retaining-the-best-teachers/\" title=\"\">education select committee report</a> that I'm keen to take forward; teacher taster sessions. Sixth formers and university students get a chance to go into schools and and get taster sessions as teachers. The other is the suggestion of establishing a College of Teaching independent of government. <br>If we're going to see significant further improvement, it will be about the quality of teaching. Michael Gove has a tendency to use teachers as human shields. If something goes wrong the easiest thing to do is talk about teachers as the enemies of promise. David Cameron did this on school sport, we need to get completely away from that sort of approach. </blockquote>"
