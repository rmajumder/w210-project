  "<p>David Laws, the new Liberal Democrat schools minister, will announce on Saturday that the pupil premium paid to schools for every child they take from a disadvantaged background will rise from the current \u00a3619 a pupil to \u00a3900 in September 2014.</p> <p>Laws will tell his party's conference that it means they have met their commitment to spend \u00a32.5bn on the pupil premium in 2014-15, the last full year of the parliament.</p> <p>Ofsted, the schools inspector, expressed concern this week at the lack of accountability over how schools spend the extra cash. Lib Dems want to see schools do more to spell out how the extra funds are spent.</p> <p>Schools receive the premium for every child registered as eligible for free school meals at any point in the past six years and children in care who have been looked after for six months. Laws and Nick Clegg see the premium as central to their drive to improve social mobility.</p> <p>Laws will tell his conference on its opening day: \"Opportunity cannot only extend to the boundaries of the playing fields of Eton, or even Westminster. It must be available in every school, in every community, in every part of our country. We are moving from an education system which entrenched privilege, to an education system which will hand opportunity to every child.\"</p> <p>Latest official statistics show 35% of pupils on free school meals achieved five good GCSE grades compared with 62% of other pupils.</p> <p>There had been debate in government on whether ministers should have done more to stipulate how the premium is spent. Critics claim the premium is only going some way to fill a gap left by cuts elsewhere in the schools budget.</p>",
  "<p>If you wanted a quick insight into the character and capacities of <a href=\"http://www.salmayaqoob.com/\" title=\"\">Salma Yaqoob</a>, you could do worse than bring up a clip, now on YouTube, of one of her appearances on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdq-3POhhfw\" title=\"\">Question Time, in&#xa0;December 2009</a>.</p> <p>The programme was broadcast that night from Wootton Bassett. It was broadcast not just to licence-fee payers in Britain, but also to serving British soldiers, including those in Afghanistan, and it had six panellists, rather than the usual five: Yaqoob, General Sir Richard Dannatt, then serving as defence adviser to David Cameron, Paddy Ashdown, Piers Morgan, Bill Rammell, then minister of state for the armed forces, and William Hague, then shadow foreign minister.</p> <p>The first, striking effect was visual \u2013 six men, including David Dimbleby, and a slight woman in a bright green cardigan and pale hijab. The next was the reasoned force of Yaqoob's argument, and how clearly and directly she spoke. Directly, first, to defuse any kneejerk doubts about her national loyalties: \"I&#xa0;am a mother,\" she said: \"I have three sons. I would be proud to have my sons defend this country\"; then to those abroad and in Wootton Bassett, concerned about the treatment of troops (the way the government is treating soldiers is \"an absolute disgrace\"), and then, having given the various constituencies unequivocal evidence that she had heard and thought about them, eviscerated the reasons for going to war, and the supposed reasons for staying. When she finished, four audience members spoke up, and all said the same thing. I agree with Salma.</p> <p>The Respect party, of which she was leader, was doing well enough that when the general election was called four months later, they hoped to take three seats. In the event, they took none, though Yaqoob came second to Labour in Birmingham Hall Green by only 3,799 votes, achieving an 11.7% swing from Labour to Respect and making it a marginal seat. After 2010, membership dropped below 1,000, but then the coalition cuts began to bite, and a party that had always campaigned both against inequality (or neoliberalism, as they would put it) as well as foreign wars (imperialism, they'd say), found that it was the former that people really wanted to talk about.</p> <p>Then in March of this year <a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/30/george-galloway-bradford-west-byelection\" title=\"\">George Galloway was elected MP of Bradford West</a> in a result that left Labour reeling. In the local elections in May, Respect acquired five councillors in Bradford. There was even talk of another possible byelection if <a href=\"http://liambyrne.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Liam Byrne</a> ran for mayor of Birmingham (voters rejected the idea of a mayor altogether), and of Yaqoob then becoming Respect's second MP.</p> <p>But last week, she resigned. The immediate catalyst was Galloway, who had said in a podcast that some of the allegations against Julian Assange by two Swedish women did not constitute rape \"as most people understand it\"; that Assange was simply guilty of \"bad sexual etiquette\". When I ask how these comments led to her leaving the party she helped to&#xa0;found, there is a long pause.</p> <p>Yaqoob, 41, is, in person, even slighter than she seems on television \u2013 she has long, thin arms and a face miraculously unlined by a decade spent raising three boys, working as a councillor in Birmingham (she resigned for reasons of ill-health last year), running a part-time psychotherapy practice \u2013 oh, and leading a new political party. She has just had a new kitchen fitted, and the backyard of her home in the Moseley area of Birmingham is piled with cardboard boxes. The ceilings are high, and the rooms full of light. On the kitchen table sits a straw basket of chapatis she has been baking.</p> <p>\"I've always admired George's anti-imperialist stances and I don't regret, for a second, standing side by side on those issues. But for me, to have to make a choice between that and standing up for the rights of women was a false choice. I thought it was a blurring of something that didn't need to be blurred. It's not that complicated \u2013 you can hold two ideas at the same time.\" Of course, \"we're all human, we can't always make perfectly worded and crafted sentences \u2013 I really hoped a clarification would sort that out.\" She published a statement setting out her own position, but then, as she describes it, things escalated. Although she says Galloway never got directly in contact \u2013 and still hasn't \u2013 she felt she was being personally maligned; that \"under the guise of different names there were personal attacks\".</p> <p>The irony is, of course, that so much of Galloway's victory in Bradford West was ascribed to women, and particularly women from traditional backgrounds who had in the past been expected to vote the way their husbands or fathers or brothers voted \u2013 the baradari system that generally delivered block votes to Labour \u2013 \"that's why it's been deeply disappointing, because I do feel that those women have been let down. [Comments like that] open the door to women being treated in a certain way. You are just dismissed, your views are not taken seriously, and a certain reactionary attitude is encouraged rather than challenged.\"</p> <p>A week before, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/31/manchester-greater-manchester\" title=\"\">Kate Hudson, who had joined Respect from the Communist party</a> after the Bradford byelection, and had been selected as their candidate for Manchester Central, withdrew her candidacy; there have been reports that in the week since Yaqoob left, others have followed her. There were accounts of crisis meetings held in Bradford, predictions in the Pakistani press (which also noted that Yaqoob had been <a href=\"http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-2-131640-Galloways-Respect-Party-leader-Salma-Yaqoob-resigns\">\"highly upset when thuggish elements, including some with a highly radical religious agenda, took control of the party during the election campaign\"</a>, although this is not an issue she mentions in our conversation) of mass exit. Yet, according<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/sep/13/georgegalloway-bradford-west-byelection-2012-muslim-women-salma-yaqoob-rape\" title=\"\"> to a piece on this paper's website, when Galloway addressed the Bradford Muslim Women's Circle</a>, hours after Yaqoob's resignation, he was still standing by \"every word I said in my podcast\".</p> <p>It looks like Respect, only six months after a great electoral victory, is imploding. Is this the end of your party? \"Only time will tell. Councillors have just been elected, on a very clear mandate. They are hardworking and principled and there is an opportunity still for them to enact that vision.\" But it would not be too extreme to assume that a significant part of that famous women's vote in Bradford came about because she comes from the Pakistani community (when her parents arrived in Britain they settled first in Bradford, where she still has family, and then in Birmingham, where her father worked 18-hour days at the Post Office to support seven children), because she is trusted and (often reluctantly) admired for a public role that has at times been difficult to play; surely the combination of her leaving, and leaving over an issue so specific to the way women are treated, is a body blow ? \"I think ... George has to deal with that in the way that he sees fit. And reflect on that.\" There's a sudden sense of the tone her sons must hear when they have overstepped the mark.</p> <p>One of the issues that has been increasingly true of Respect is the way in which it has often seemed, from the outside at least, to be dominated by one man, Gorgeous George, with all his undeniable gifts, but also his unpredictability, his ego, his sometimes dubious decisions (his salute to Saddam Hussein's \"courage, strength and indefatigability\"; his stated \"respect and admiration\" of Syria's Assad in an email). Many people did not necessarily realise Yaqoob was party leader. Was that not galling? \"Not at all! It's not a popularity contest \u2013 at least not for me. It's about the ideas \u2013 and I'm proud \u2013 whoever champions those ideas and they get that support it's a victory for all of us. Which is why I'm very open about supporting, for example, members of the Green party, or members of the Labour party, who share that progressive vision.\"</p> <p>Ah yes, the Green party. And Labour. Immediately after she resigned, Caroline Lucas was tweeting, \"Really hope Salma Yaqoob's resignation from Respect doesn't mean she's leaving politics \u2013 we need her clarity and vision,\" and Birmingham Labour MP Richard Burden was suggesting a possible future in Labour. These overtures are not a new development \u2013 it has even, in the past, been reported that she's had approaches from the Lib Dems and the Conservatives (which says something about the worlds she straddles, and the nature of her appeal; it could also be a cynical calculation about visible diversification and the attendant votes).</p> <p>\"This is all in 2010 \u2013 it's no secret that people have made approaches. But then my political platform and principles are very, very clear \u2013 there was never that temptation. And right now, although I'm very flattered and honoured, I'm taking stock.\" (She says that Galloway has been keen to find a way back to Labour. \"This is the irony \u2013 he's always said to me, 'if you have an approach, just make sure that I can come back in'. Ironically, that has not been on the cards. I think it's a great sadness to him, understandably, that he was expelled [for his vocal opposition to the Iraq war].\")</p> <p>Not everyone, of course, would be happy to see her join the Labour party: \"Labour right already hyperventilating at thought of @SalmaYaqoob joining party. No problem with Tories though #doublestandards,\" tweeted Diane Abbott. Others pointed to an open letter Yaqoob signed that stated: \"The US government and its allies, and their friends in the media, have built up a campaign against Assange which now sees him in prison facing extradition on dubious charges \u2026 We demand his immediate release, the dropping of all charges, and an end to the censorship of WikiLeaks.\" \"If you don't want the seriousness of the charges to be diminished,\" blogged Dan Hodges, \"why denounce them as 'dubious', claim they are part of a US government conspiracy, and call for them to be dropped?\" The word \"charges\" relates to extradition, she points out \u2013 Assange has not yet been charged with rape.</p> <p>There is also a significant cohort worried about the nature of the membership of Respect, that it is an uneasy alliance of far left and Islamist far right.\"I will not accept that. I've been there from the beginning. I know that we have fought those very reactionary forces, we challenged them from within. I get the hate calls \u2013 I get people in the streets saying, 'She is trying to wreck our homes.' I've had the death threats, that anyone who beheads me will go straight to heaven. Because I promote democracy, because I have a very clear stance on pluralism. Pluralism is not about just supporting people you happen to agree with anyway. I would challenge anybody to say where I have pandered to, never mind encouraged, any reactionary stance.\"</p> <p>It has been exhausting, she says, arguing with \"people who misunderstand or deliberately project their stereotypes, so you're constantly saying, 'I'm not this' or 'I'm not that,' while trying to maintain a clarity of what you actually are.\" This is, in many ways, one of the most likable and impressive things about her \u2013 her robust refusal of easy, essentialising demographic assumptions, even those that might initially play, politically, in her favour \u2013 but also, having done this, her patient spelling out of a vision. Granted, that vision can sound incredibly idealistic, and in these careful days almost shockingly left-wing, but, unusually for a political leader, it doesn't feel rote.</p> <p>And this ability to stand for herself is, of course, what she'd be risking by joining a bigger party such as Labour \u2013 even though she makes a point of saying that they seem to be making baby steps in what (for her) is the right direction: \"We've seen Ed Miliband say that the Iraq war was wrong. We've seen him be bold before a lot of other people about Murdoch and the corporatisation of media, the fact that he's talking about inequality as an issue.\" But for her it is all still too timid. \"I think there is real potential for mobilising around what people are feeling right now at home. And yet [they are also] feeling, 'Who's championing us, who's speaking for us?' There is a vacuum there. Labour is the natural home for those people, but it needs to not take that for granted, needs to infuse [their message] not just with a negative narrative of, 'Oh, the Tories are scary and let people down,' but actually with hope.\"</p>",

It works for a wide variety of common problems, severe or mild; from defiant \u2013 even violent \u2013 aggression to shyness, sleeping problems or underperformance at school.</p> <p>This is not the same as \"quality time\" \u2013 just hanging out with your child. When you love bomb, you create a special emotional zone wholly different from normal life, with new rules. More than 100 families have tried it, nearly all with positive results.</p> <p>So, how exactly does it work? First, you explain to your child that, sometime soon, the two of you are going to spend time together, one to one, and have a lot of fun. Your child is going to decide what they want and when they want it, within reason. You give the message that this is going to be a Big Event: It's Coming Soon ... How Exciting! The child then draws up a list of things to do. It doesn't matter if it includes lots of SpongeBob SquarePants: the key is that your child has chosen it.</p> <p>Throughout the experience, you are trying, as much as possible, to give them the feeling of \"whatever I want, I get\" \u2013 of being in control and of being gratified, as well as bombed with love.</p> <p>You may be thinking: Is he mad? My child is a tyrant \u2013 rewarding him like that is just going to make it even worse! This is understandable. Love bombing seems to fly in the face of conventional wisdom, which often recommends more control, not less, when a child is not complying, and stricter, firmer reactions to undesirable behaviour.</p> <p>But the love bomb zone is separate from ordinary life. Outside the zone, you continue to set boundaries, consistently and firmly. In fact, the love bombing experience will feed back in a benign way, greatly reducing the time you spend imposing limits, nagging and nattering \u2013 the \"Don't do that\", \"I've told you before, put that down\", \"Leave your sister alone\" into which all parents get sucked sometimes. Almost any child \u2013 even happy ones \u2013 will benefit.</p> <p>A key practical decision at the outset is the length of time to spend in the zone and the frequency. At one extreme, you can take your child away from home for a couple of nights at a hotel, bed &amp; breakfast etc.</p> <p>Alternatively, as many parents have done, the rest of your family can spend the weekend with relatives or friends, leaving you at home with your child. There is no need to spend money. Many parents have done a day away or just bursts of a few hours.</p> <p>In the case of Miranda and her depressed son Tim, as a dual-income family, they could afford two nights away at an inexpensive hotel. They settled in on the Friday night and set off into town on the Saturday. Much of the time was spent just wandering around, with a certain amount of shopping and a visit to an aquarium.</p> <p>Miranda recalled that this day \"made Tim feel very special. It worked. And when it came to spending money, Tim was reasonable about absolutely everything, much to my surprise.\"</p> <p>Children who feel loved are likely to be less consumption-obsessed.</p> <p>After a peaceful Saturday night at the hotel with a takeaway and the television, Miranda and Tim pottered around again on the Sunday and visited a zoo on the way home.</p> <p>As well as Tim feeling in control during this time, there was much affection expressed. Miranda recalls: \"Tim spent a great deal of time cuddling up to me and telling me how much he loved me (always reciprocated). It was interesting for me not to be in charge. I do tend to lead. Here, it really was mostly Tim's decision what we did next, what we ate and what we watched on TV.\"</p> <p>In the guidelines I offer, I suggest getting the child to give the experience a name before doing it, like Special Time or Mummy Time or Daddy Time. Often it helps to have a material object to remind them of the experience, like a stone from a beach or a teddy bear. Using this and the name to help as prompts, on returning, parents are asked to try to carve out half an hour an evening when they can briefly re-enter the love bomb zone together, even if only to watch TV.</p> <p>The impact of Tim's love bombing was immediate and dramatic. Five weeks later, Miranda wrote to me: \"Overall he is happier. He still has tantrums, but since the weekend away I haven't heard him say that he hates himself once.\"</p> <p>Eighteen months later, she reported: \"It is getting better, largely due to the love bombing and subsequent changes in our relationship.\"</p> <p>I have had similar reports of sustained success \u2013 followed up one to two years after the love bombing \u2013 from parents helping children with violent aggression, myriad anxiety problems, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), sleeplessness, perfectionism and even autism.</p> <p>In many cases, I suspect that the experience stabilises levels of the fight-flight hormone cortisol. If too high, the child can be manic or aggressive or anxious. If too low \u2013 blunted \u2013 the child may be listless or surly.</p> <p>Even a brief experience of love and control seems to correct that. Recent evidence suggests that children are far more plastic than was once thought and that the way they are is not fixed, for the vast majority of problems.</p> <p>The love bombing zone need not be a whole weekend. For instance, Sam, three, seemed a lot more sensitive than his younger brother, easily overwhelmed by simple situations. Sometimes he would melt down in toddler-like rages. He got very jumpy when separated from his mother, Emma. She said: \"In the house, he wants to know where I am all the time. \"If Emma was upstairs and he was downstairs he would scream asking her whereabouts.</p> <p>For practical reasons, she planned two consecutive Saturdays away from home with him, rather than a night. Sam named the first Pirate Day because they went to a funfair. He adored feeling in control and the expressions of love. As recommended by my protocol of what to do, she told him that she loved him repeatedly. Once into the habit, she continued. Since that day they both have found it easier to express love frequently . She believes they have \"much, much better communication\" and says: \"It reminded us of the good times that we can have together, setting us back on that track. It was a truly lovely day.\"</p> <p>Often it is not just the child's thermostat that is corrected, it is also the parent's in relation to the child. After love bombing, many report that it has been the first time for months, or years, they have remembered how much they love their child.</p> <p>Emma and Sam's second day was based at home and included a complete meltdown by him. It is extremely common during love bombing for the child to test out if the parent is for real \u2013 really loves them or will still love them if they are horrible. Emma rode it out and they emerged much closer.</p> <p>Afterwards, she reported: \"He has not had any unreachable tantrums since that one on the last love bombing day, four weeks ago.\" What is more, Sam's fear of not knowing where his mother is in the house has gone.</p> <p>However you do love bombing, there is nothing to lose. What's not to like about spending time having fun with your child? If it transforms them and your relationship, so much the better \u2013 the worst that can happen is you return from the zone having had a good time.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Love Bombing: Reset Your Child's Emotional Thermostat is published by Karnac Books, \u00a39.99.

  "<p>Carrol Smith was only recently married when she heard her father-in-law had been diagnosed with a serious illness. \"I remember answering the phone to my mother-in-law, hearing her voice, knowing it wasn't good news,\" says Carrol. \"Victor had been ill for some time: he was very shaky and getting quite short-tempered.\"</p> <p>Her mother-in-law, Maureen, said Victor's illness was progressive and would eventually be fatal. \"She said it was called <a href=\"http://hda.org.uk/hd/what-is-hd\" title=\"\">Huntington's Disease</a>. I'd never heard of it: I think I just said, oh,\" says Carrol.</p> <p>While desperately sad for her parents-in-law, Carrol had no inkling that this was far more than bad news. It was nearly a decade before she understood that her father-in-law's diagnosis would profoundly affect her own life and the lives of her husband, Gary, and their future children.</p> <p>In a way, she says, ignorance was bliss. For the next few years, things went on as usual. Gary enjoyed working as a civil engineer and Carrol worked as a secretary, and later in a restaurant. They moved to Hullbridge, Essex, where they still live, and in 1991 had a son, Ben, followed four years later by a daughter, Megan.</p> <p>The arrival of grandchildren was one bright spot on the horizon for Gary's parents, who were by now in the full throes of living with Huntington's.</p> <p>\"Victor [who has since died] was getting worse and worse \u2013 towards the end he was unable to communicate and spent a lot of time in bed,\" says Carrol, 50. \"It was terribly sad to see, and to see the awful effect on Gary's mum. It's not really a marriage any more, when you're faced with caring for a partner like that. It was tough for her, relentless.\"</p> <p>Looking back there were clues that all wasn't well with Gary: he caught a bug he couldn't shake off and had unusual memory lapses. There was no reason to think it was anything sinister, but in the newspapers the headlines were all about variant CJD. \"I was really worried I'd got that,\" says Gary, 55. \"I knew I wasn't right inside and things had started to add up.\"</p> <p>Only they hadn't, not until a hospital appointment in 1997. Gary had been referred for tests and it was clear the doctors were baffled. \"I remember this moment when the doctor said: is there any illness in your family? When we said Gary's dad had HD [Huntington's Disease], the doctor's expression changed \u2013 it was as though a light had gone on,\" says Carrol.</p> <p>All the couple were told, though, was that Gary would need a blood test.</p> <p>\"So we went to where they did blood tests and said, 'Gary's been told he needs a test but we're not sure what for.' And the nurse looked at his notes and said, 'You can't just walk in for this. You'll need counselling first.'\"</p> <p>And that, says Carrol, is the moment that the truth hit her for the first time.</p> <p>HD, she realised, hadn't just been a tragedy for Victor and Maureen \u2013 it was a tragedy for them all. And especially for Gary, who \u2013 at the age of 40 \u2013 was probably in the early stages.</p> <p>But beyond Gary were Ben and Megan, then aged six and two. \"I remember the way the fear rippled through, how it gripped me \u2013 not them too!\" Later, they learned that Gary did, indeed, have HD: and at that stage, doctors were able to confirm there was a 50% chance the children would have the gene as well. \"The one thing they know about HD is that everyone who has the gene will, sooner or later, develop the illness,\" says Carrol.</p> <p>She and Gary could hardly bear to think about what HD could do, not just to them but to the children. They decided it was much too early to tell them. \"We thought it would be best to wait till they were older,\" says Carrol. The right moment came a few years later. \"Gary's condition was taking hold \u2013 he'd started to drop things a lot. This particular night the children were laughing at him, which was making him really cross. I said, 'This is the time: they need to know.' We'd been making up excuses about why Gary had to go to hospital so often \u2013 they needed to know what was going on.\"</p> <p>For Ben, now 21, then 16 \u2013 and Megan, now 17, then 12, it was a lot to take in. Their immediate concern was for their dad rather than their own health. \"I remember feeling confused,\" says Ben. \"We went from being a completely normal family to getting this big slap in the face. But I was mostly worried for Dad, wondering what his future would hold \u2013 and for Mum, thinking about what life was going to be like for her.\"</p> <p>For Megan, things fell into place. \"I used to sit on the floor near Dad to watch telly, and he was always moving his feet around and kicking me,\" she says. \"Now I knew why \u2013 Mum explained that involuntary movements were part of his illness. We spent more than three hours talking it all through that evening. Then we all cried before going to bed. We knew our family was never going to be the same.\"</p> <p>The children wondered whether to tell their friends and decided to wait. \"It seemed a scary thing to tell other people,\" says Megan. \"At school a girl asked to borrow my pen; and when she realised I'd been sucking it, she said: I don't want it, you might have a disease. I thought, does she know?\"</p> <p>HD can only be passed from parent to child: it's caused by a faulty gene on chromosome 4. At some point in life, damage is caused to nerve cells in the brain, leading to gradual physical, mental and emotional changes. Looking back, Gary and Carrol could see a pattern through his family.</p> <p>\"His uncle had it, and a cousin,\" says Carrol. \"Further back there were relatives who we think had been put into asylums \u2013 in the past, HD was considered a form of madness.\"</p> <p>As Ben and Megan neared adulthood, the big question was whether or not to have a blood test for the faulty gene, although that wouldn't reveal when the disease would develop. \"Deciding whether to have the test is really huge because it has massive implications if the test is positive,\" says Ben, a racing car mechanic. \"It can make it difficult to get a mortgage or life insurance and cause employment problems.\"</p> <p>For now, he and his sister have decided against a test. \"I don't think it would improve my life to know,\" says Megan. \"I'm going to live to the max: I'm going to take every opportunity I can, I'm going to savour life and its experiences. If I do have it, then I'll have enjoyed every minute I&#xa0;could.\"</p> <p>Megan is an indefatigable fundraiser for the <a href=\"http://hda.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Huntington's Disease Association</a> \u2013 and realising she'd need to rope in her friends, decided to tell them about her family. \"Everyone has been really kind and when we&#xa0;were learning about genetics in science I was asked to do a presentation about HD.\"</p> <p>She's glad others know. There are often moments in life, she says, when she needs reassurance. \"It's always there at the back of your mind. I think about it every single day. Every time I twitch or drop something I think, could this be it? But I have to try not to panic, and my friends are really good at helping me deal with it.\"</p> <p>Typically, people with HD develop symptoms between the ages of 35 and 45 \u2013 but early onset is possible.</p> <p>\"Sometimes I can hardly bear to just wait and see what happens,\" says Carrol. \"I think, I've got to know \u2013 I've got to find out whether my children have this. But then I think, if they tested positive, how would I begin to handle that? It's the most horrific cloud to have to live under.\"</p> <p>It's not just the worry about the children: there are also the increasingly burdensome daily issues of caring for Gary. \"His condition has progressed a lot over the last few years \u2013 he can't work, he has trouble walking. In many ways, he's not the man I married. He has periods of really quite deep depression, which are terrible to watch him go through.</p> <p>\"And people don't always understand that he's got a medical condition: the symptoms look like intoxication, so you've got other people's attitudes about that to deal with as well.</p> <p>\"It's a long way from the life I expected to be living at this stage. I get through it and I know I'm lucky to have a lot of support from my family and friends \u2013 and Ben and Megan, of&#xa0;course.\"</p> <p>Looking back to the day she first heard the words Huntington's Disease, Carrol can hardly believe she was in the dark for so long. \"But we're not the only family to have had this experience: the way genetic conditions are dealt with has changed a lot over the last few years. In the past things were swept under the carpet and it was easier not to say anything than confront it head-on.\"</p> <p>Bill Crowder, of the Huntington's Disease Association, confirms this: he says it's only in the last 10 years or so that doctors have begun to make the repercussions of the diagnosis clear. \"It was only in 1993 \u2013 so two years after Gary's dad was diagnosed \u2013 that the predictive test was developed that could pinpoint whether or not an individual had the gene, and would get the disease,\" he says.</p> <p>Had they known what it meant, Carrol says it's unlikely she and Gary would have had children. \"It's impossible to know, but we'd have thought very hard and very long before bringing children into the world with this hanging over their heads,\" she says.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of research going on and our big hope is that if Ben and Megan do have the gene, treatments will be vastly improved by the time they develop symptoms.\"</p> <p>Gary, who finds talking difficult, nods in agreement. \"We didn't have a clue when we had the children,\" he says. \"But all the same, I feel the guilt. This thing came through my family \u2013 and it's the most horrible thing to feel you've handed something like this on to your children.</p> <p>\"There's so much I'd like to be able to do with them that I can't. Megan has just done her AS-levels and I wish I'd been able to talk to her about her courses, to help her with her revision. And I wish I could still go out to the races with Ben \u2013 we always loved doing that together.\"</p> <p>There is, though, one ray of light at the end of this family's long, dark tunnel. It's now possible, through gamete gene testing and IVF, to ensure that a couple affected by the HD gene only conceive and give birth to children who are free of the condition. \"That's an absolutely brilliant advance,\" says&#xa0;Megan.</p> <p>\"If I do find out I have the gene, I'll have my eggs tested before having a child. Ben would do the same. Our family has had to live with this horrible disease for generations, but we'll be the ones who'll change things for the future. We're going to make sure that the terrible difficulties our parents and grandparents had to live with will never touch the lives of our children and grandchildren. I feel quite proud of that.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Jeans for Genes Day, on 5 October, invites people to wear jeans to school or work in return for a donation to </em><a href=\"http://www.geneticdisordersuk.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Genetic Disorders UK</em></a><em>, j</em><a href=\"http://www.jeansforgenesday.org/\" title=\"\"><em>eansforgenesday.org</em></a><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>I grew up listening to the sound of the bagpipes. It is one of the reasons any noise now rarely disturbs me. The family story is that when I was born, my mother, on the way back from hospital, suggested to my father that he might want to stop playing the pipes at home. They were living in a tiny rented flat and my mother, holding her first baby in her arms, was anxious that the sound of him practising was going to disturb me, that his tuning up and long hours of playing an instrument that one 16th century poet likened to \"a diseased heron\" would keep me awake at night. \"Nonsense!\" my father replied. \"It will be lovely and soothing. If anything, the music will help her sleep.\"</p> <p>My father has always been very opinionated. About how he's to behave. About how he will spend his time. The Gunns generally, he says, have always been clear on matters of principle. We haven't based ourselves in one of the most remote and, some might say, inhospitable parts of the British mainland, the far north-east of Scotland, for nothing. The family motto is \"Peace or War\", after all, and the sound of the pipes has indeed taken armies in the past and present off to fight and into battle.</p> <p>Not that <em>p\u00ecobaireachd</em>, which is what my father has always played, the most formal and ancient form of classical bagpipe music, is anything like those rabble-rousing tunes. <em>P\u00ecobaireachd</em>, or <em>Ce\u00f2l M\u00f3r</em>, the \"big music\", as it is also known, will always be a lament or a salute. Something much more like a song, my father has always said. Something restful, musical, complex and very beautiful \u2026</p> <p>I agree with him now.</p> <p>Growing up, though, in far away New Zealand where we then lived, the sound of his enthusiasm was embarrassing and exhausting. \"What's that noise?\" was the refrain of my childhood \u2013 when visitors arrived, or friends came over to play.</p> <p>Tuning up the pipes is challenging to the ear, no doubt about it. It can go on for half an hour or more before the player even starts in on one of the long, slow tunes that must be played without interruption. I can remember, as a small child, going to stand in the room where my father was playing \u2013 to wait to pass on a message or ask him something, all conveyed in sign language or by mouthing the words \u2013 and it might be hours, it seemed to me, before he would even notice that I was there. Then there'd be a quick nod to a cup of tea, or a shake of the head, when I indicated that someone was waiting on the phone. Then he'd turn and march off the other way as though I'd never been there.</p> <p>\"Nonsense!\" he always said again, whenever any of us children complained. When we wanted to go out and he was holding up a family expedition. \"Nonsense!\" again \u2013 while my mother was waiting to serve food. \"Nonsense!\" was how he did what he wanted, in the way he wanted to do it. \"Nonsense!\" he said when we wanted to play other music on the stereo or someone had the television on. \"Nonsense!\" to our new neighbours when we'd moved house next door to a pianist and her cellist husband, who came over right at the start to introduce themselves. They'd heard, somehow, that my father played the pipes, and looked troubled as they explained that they had quiet evenings of chamber music, that she taught piano to children in the afternoons; he singing in the evenings.</p> <p>The moment of meeting could have exploded unpleasantly \u2013 I remember noticing that as a child. My father standing ramrod straight as the new neighbours indicated that, though there were large trees between their garden and ours, they were worried about noise. \"Nonsense!\" my father said, and he had a smile on his face. \"The bagpipes are a lovely instrument. There's nothing for you to worry about. You'll get used to them, you'll see.\"</p> <p>He was right. The wife went on to become my piano teacher. They came over for evening drinks, for carols at Christmas time. \"Your father's quite a character,\" she said. That \"Nonsense!\" of his \u2013 egocentric, single-minded \u2026selfish? \u2013 had won the day. It was his way of not letting anything get between him and his music.</p> <p>When my mother was diagnosed with the cancer that would kill her, my younger brother, sister and I, all under the age of 12, were suddenly made aware of a terrible silence in the house \u2013 my parents all at once shut away in the sitting room, with hushed phone calls, low voices, their bedroom door always closed. It was a great relief when, after some time, my father picked up his pipes again. He played through my mother's illness and her endless hospital visits. He played after chemotherapy and surgery. He played as she lay quietly in her room. He invited his piper friends over in the weekends and in the evenings, too, and they played for hours on end. All <em>piobaireachd</em> without a break.</p> <p>Some of my mother's relatives, and my father's, for that matter, suggested that maybe he should give up for a while. But by now his own family would not have wanted him to. The sound was part of our life, and the silence of his grief as he watched the wife he loved slip away from him was moored in the tunes he played. One lament after the other.</p> <p>The sound never stopped. He played after my mother's funeral \u2013 at the party that went on for two days and longer. He played through the long summer that followed, and the summers after that, at our place by a lake \u2013 a simple sort of cottage where there's not a great deal of room so my father used to practise outside instead. There the music carried across the great silvery expanse of water, echoing and reverberating through twilight into night, keeping goodness knows how many people awake. Tiny children, still in their swimsuits from the long, hot day would gather, awestruck, at the edge of our garden, clusters of them standing in the velvety dark. \"What is it?\" they would say, and their parents, \"What <em>is</em> that noise?\"</p> <p>As I went deeper into my teens I became more and more mortified by that question. I had new friends \u2013 groovier, far cooler than I could ever be \u2013 phoning me up to talk about homework and boys, and they, too, were asking that same question. \"What on earth's that awful noise?\" Later, nervous boyfriends asked it too, dropping me off at the front gate after a party or a dance, and looking around anxiously, not wanting to come inside. \"Is that your father?\" they said. Of course it was, and there was nothing, nothing I could do about it.</p> <p>How awful this was for me, and awful to think about \u2013 that sense of shame, the embarrassment, the self-consciousness, awareness that our family seemed different from the rest. I remember, and by now this was a few years after my mother's death, a teacher phoning the house \u2013 he was concerned that I'd been falling behind in an English class so he rang and I answered. Down the hall, my father was well into his second hour of play. \"Oh, my God!\" the teacher cried. \"What is that I can hear in the background? Is everything all right?\"</p> <p>\"It's my father,\" I had to reply. \"He's playing the bagpipes.\"</p> <p>Now I'm all grown up, though, and those years are far behind me. I've had a long time to consider all this, these memories of a difficult music and how it has been imprinted on me. I can see now that, though it's been hard to accept, I've been lucky to have been brought up by a parent so committed to his art that nothing may swerve him from it. Not the birth of a child, or the death of his wife. Not the embarrassment and shame of his daughters. Not a sense of social propriety and standing. Of worrying what others may think. I have my own children now and I write books that take me, like the pipes took my father, far away from them, into my own sphere and space where I too, like him, must endlessly practise.</p> <p>My father is 82 now and he had a fall last year. He doesn't drive as much as he used to, or go out. But he will be playing at the <a href=\"http://www.halkirkgames.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Halkirk Highland Games</a> this year, and maybe in Skye, as he does most years. And still, like me, he keeps going back to what he does. Playing the tunes. And playing them again \u2026</p> <p>When my father's oldest, dearest friend \u2013 someone he's known since they played together as boys in a pipe band \u2013 emerged from a stroke last year, the first person he asked for was my father and started talking about <em>piobaireachd</em>. For art, as well as offering the consolations of form and shape and beauty in a troubled word, protects us. \"It's a comfort to him,\" my granny used to say, during those hours and hours while my father played as my mother was dying. But it seems my father has been right all along. It was a comfort to us, too. The sound of his music helped all of us sleep.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/27/big-music-kirsty-gunn-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Big Music</em></a><em> is published by Faber, \u00a320.

  "<p>For anyone who doubts the therapeutic effects of the internet, I can recommend the Twitter feed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TTPMO\" title=\"\">@ThingsThatPissMeOff</a>. It made me realise that I am not alone in spending so much of my life being pissed off. True, a lot of the things that piss off the tweeters don't piss me off at all. \"Not being texted back\", for instance, or \"not respecting God\". But \"being interrupted when you're trying to say something important\" is right up there, along with \"forgetting what you were doing\".</p> <p>The story of family life is the story of how you manage the way you piss each other off. I have a greater range of techniques to annoy than anyone else in my family, and I consider this one of my few genuine achievements as a father.</p> <p>I don't listen. I try to steal the food off other's plates. I do things with bad grace. I don't respect the recycling bins. I am surly with waitresses. I make excuses. I lose things \u2013 sometimes other people's things \u2013 then incessantly ask where they are, or blame other people for losing them.</p> <p>I knock things over. I won't relinquish the TV control. I leave a trail of detritus behind me as I make my way around the house, consisting of food remnants and dirty clothes. I repeat myself unnecessarily. I start tasks without finishing them. I don't put the loo seat up when I'm peeing. I repeat myself unnecessarily.</p> <p>So much for the mea culpas. This is what really pisses me off about my family, children first. Tantrums. Disobedience. A child's assumption that they are living in a five-star hotel in which their parents are menials. Telling tales \u2013 especially about me, to my wife. The insistence on fanatically, meaningless equality between siblings, as in \"her Nobbly Bobbly ice lolly has got better coloured bobbles than mine\". Pointless resistance to the inevitable, such as refusing to go to bed unless threatened. A permanently livid sense of injustice.</p> <p>I could continue but it isn't really the point. The real point of this column is to say what annoys me about my wife, because I can never get it all out in real life without her interrupting me, which is very much one of the things that pisses me off about her.</p> <p>What pisses me off about my wife is that she is more often right than me, and she doesn't have the good grace to conceal the fact. She only remembers what she want to, and claims that I do the same thing, which is clearly absurd, because I know I only remember what is true.</p> <p>She pisses me off when she tweets while watching TV programmes and the programmes she watches piss me off even more \u2013 what is a PhD in literature doing watching Celebrity Big Brother, Masterchef, and The Apprentice? She pisses me off when, with her lit crit hat on, she informs me that \"the author is dead\", when I'm not, and it pisses me off that she claims to know more about Shakespeare than me just because she happens to teach it.</p> <p>I could continue. In fact, why don't I? She pisses me off when I show her one of these columns in advance and, as a matter of routine, she informs me that it's \"a bit desperate\" or \"rather shallow\", and it pisses me off even more when she's right. It pisses me off when I try to cook something and she stands over me to make sure I don't make any mistakes, therefore ensuring I make mistakes all the time.</p> <p>Most of all, it pisses me off that however much she pisses me off, I still can't help loving her. The same goes for my children, and life itself, because life is not the proverbial bowl of cherries. Life is being pissed off. All a good life really amounts to is not minding that much.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Tim on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://es.twitter.com/timlottwriter\" title=\"\"><em>@timlottwriter</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Looking after someone with advanced dementia is tough. They're unpredictable, sometimes aggressive and need help to get dressed, eat and go to the toilet. Their charm has often been scoured away, aside from the odd glimmer, and they are a constant reminder of the endgame. For many of us, work is a distraction from human frailty. For such carers, it's something they must constantly negotiate.</p> <p>So it takes a special kind of person to do a good job in such difficult, depressing circumstances, usually on minimum wage.</p> <p>Since Dad got ill, one of the rare pluses has been learning how many of these individuals are out there. Far from the urban life I'm used to \u2013 full of people distracted by house prices, handbags and bonuses \u2013 there's another world where others are quietly doing something much more meaningful. It's pretty shaming actually.</p> <p>Of course, for some carers it's just a job \u2013 one of the easier ones to get in a poor, rural area when you have few qualifications. But for a heartening number, caring is a vocation; they do it so well and afford their patient such dignity, it's truly inspiring to watch.</p> <p>While I've often, in the last couple of years, been distracted by Dad's latest crisis, I've also still managed to find comfort in the qualities that such natural carers offer. First, and most important, is warmth. It's obvious, but some people really do have a Ready brek glow. They put you at ease, they put your poor, demented relative at ease. Everyone can finally breathe a sigh of relief.</p> <p>Enthusiasm is a close second in the virtue stakes. Life in a dementia care home isn't about excitement, that's for sure, and the ability to approach those long, shapeless days with a smile is admirable. I'll never forget the afternoon I went to visit Dad and one of his carers put on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/12/film-review-the-hangover\" title=\"\">The Hangover</a> for everyone in the main living room to watch.</p> <p>The sight of a roomful of slumped dementia patients watching a series of drunken Las Vegas misadventures was incongruous, to say the least. Certainly none of them had a clue what was going on, but she just sat there hooting with laughter, injecting the room with&#xa0;life.</p> <p>Which leads on to another thing I've noticed that really great carers do: they make things seem normal. In the face of terminal decline, the business of making each day happily unremarkable is a gift.</p> <p>Fear has a way of sucking the joy out of life's smaller pleasures \u2013 cups of tea, slices of cake, good songs on the radio, juicy gossip. And some carers are really skilled at reclaiming it. Composure is also important. When someone is slowly but inexorably losing control of their bladder and bowels, with all the attendant accidents and embarrassment, a certain sang-froid is welcome.</p> <p>I've also noticed that Dad's best carers demonstrate great flexibility. They will pick up whatever scraps of dialogue he throws out and spin them out into something like a conversation. They are pleased by his compliments, interested in his odd declarations.</p> <p>They are also tactile. They don't shy away from his hugs or flinch when he wants to stroke their faces. They don't deprive him of that fundamental human need to touch someone else, and in that way they dignify him.</p> <p>That thread of humanity is what skilled caring preserves. Dementia sufferers are just people, like you or me. What has happened to them could happen to any of us, and if it does we have to hope that someone holds our hand.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Rebecca on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebeccahelenley\" title=\"\"><em>@rebeccahelenley</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Only in Brooklyn would you find a place called the Body Actualized Center For Cosmic Living. Its mission, as outlined on a website that resembles a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/yeasayer\" title=\"\">Yeasayer</a> album campaign, is all about \"raising human consciousness by supporting the artist within\". The ideal venue, in other words, for a recent comeback gig by 70s cosmic rocker Franco Falsini, who was raising consciousness through music long before the hipster hippies conquered the area.</p> <p>Over the past 40 years, the Italian underground legend has embraced progressive rock, disco, post-punk, acid house and even psychedelic trance, but is only now, in his 60s, enjoying a revival of sorts. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/dj-shadow\" title=\"\">DJ Shadow</a>, it should be said, was the first to acknowledge him, sampling Falsini's pioneering 70s group Sensations' Fix \u2013 Florence's answer to Faust or Pink Floyd \u2013 on 2002's The Private Press. In 2008, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/sonic-youth\" title=\"\">Sonic Youth</a> paid their own discreet tribute by subtitling an exhibition of their artwork and ephemera \"Sensational Fix\", while last year John Elliott \u2013 from US hip synth voyagers Emeralds \u2013 reissued Falsini's 1975 solo album <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoIJtqJp0Ww\" title=\"\">Cold Nose</a>, an enchanting drone piece originally composed for a short film warning of the dangers of cocaine use.</p> <p>At the time, Falsini's Italian label Polydor was freaked out by his group of longhairs. \"They thought we were a bunch of drug addicts to be kept at a distance,\" he told the <a href=\"http://psychedelicbaby.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">It's Psychedelic Baby</a> blog earlier this year. \"We were kept out of the studios with the excuse that 'the smoke was hurting the machines'.\" Falsini lightened a little in the early-80s, producing Electra's frisky aerobics anthem Feels Good (Carrots &amp; Beets) \u2013 played by everyone from Horse Meat Disco to Aphex Twin \u2013 and knocking out a fantastic album of new wave pop in 1983 as the Antennas (check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaDgSAgzM3M\" title=\"\">Just Your Love</a>). Throughout the next decade he produced hours of mind-expanding acid-trance for his Interactive Test label.</p> <p>Now an excellent compilation focusing on the earlier, more ethereal side of Sensations' Fix, called Music Is Painting In The Air (1974-1977), is released by New York's <a href=\"http://www.igetrvng.com/\" title=\"\">RVNG Intl</a>, home to recent albums by Julia Holter and Sun Araw. For RVNG label manager Matt Werth, Falsini shares certain qualities with his new labelmates.</p> <p>\"There's something incredibly personal and earnest, though greatly escapist, about Franco's songwriting,\" he says. Compiled from the original tapes by Falsini and his son Jeyon, the album offers a journey through fluid krautrock, space-age synth work and metaphysical meandering.</p> <p>Werth has tentative plans for future volumes of Sensations' Fix collections, while Falsini who lives in Florence but has family in Virginia, has recently been spotted jamming with the likes of dreamy LA lo-fi bands Regal Degal and Puro Instinct.</p> <p>\"Franco is an unassuming artist who is turned on by freedom,\" notes Werth. \"What he does next is anyone's guess.\"</p>",

  "<p>When John Major returned to his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp94BNovs0o\" title=\"\">childhood haunts in Brixton for that famous 1992 election broadcast</a>, he looked distinctly uncomfortable. Dressed in an Armani suit, he was filmed buying kippers at the market before sweeping past his former family homes in a chauffeur-driven car. Then he spotted his parents' old house in Burton Road and his self-consciousness slipped away. \"It's still there,\" he whispered, straining against his seatbelt. \"It is, it is ... it's still there.\"</p> <p>It's no secret that he loathed the experience and commentators assumed he was ashamed of his background. The son of a trapeze artist, music-hall entertainer and purveyor of garden gnomes, he was painted as a complex man full of insecurities, suppressed rage and an educational and social chippiness he could never overcome. But not for the first time, perhaps, the pundits misread the signs.</p> <p>\"I wasn't embarrassed about my background at all, but I was concerned about the privacy of my family,\" he says. \"I'm very proud of what my parents achieved and what they stood for. They didn't have much, but in many ways they were richer than most. But it's perfectly true that I didn't wish to do the Brixton video. I thought the idea was corny, but I was persuaded by <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/oxford_people/key_university_officers/chancellor.html\" title=\"\">Chris Patten </a>and others.\" He laughs gently: \"Everyone said that famous line was fake, but it wasn't. It was absolutely genuine. I thought the house had been redeveloped.\"</p> <p>Now, as if to prove his doubters wrong, he has placed his parents firmly centre stage in his new book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/12/my-old-man-john-major-review\" title=\"\">My Old Man</a>, a homage to his father and the music-hall tradition. But today I suspect that family ties are the last thing on his mind.</p> <p>It seems his lot in life always to be overshadowed by meddlesome women. When he was prime minister, it was his <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/417211.stm\" title=\"\">\"backseat driver\" Margaret Thatcher</a>. Now it's his former lover Edwina Currie who is also <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2200025/Edwina-Currie-In-aftermath-affair-John-Major-shes-diaries-serialised-Mail.html\" title=\"\">hard on the publicity trail promoting her latest volume of diaries</a>. Indeed, on the day we meet she has revealed more intimate details of their past relationship and the headline, writ large across a national newspaper, reads: \"John Major was a sexy beast.\"</p> <p>Major has suggested we meet in the plush surroundings of the Goring Hotel in Belgravia, central London, a stone's throw from Victoria Station. When I arrive, he is having his picture taken in a neighbouring room and there is a large reception committee. Heading the pack is his chief of staff, a commanding woman who, I suspect, is fiercely loyal to her boss, not to mention a publicist and two Special Branch officers. I knew I'd be here to talk showbusiness, but I didn't realise I'd be playing to an audience.</p> <p>Major, habitually dubbed the grey man of politics, is today resplendent in a sharp suit and designer specs. If today's headline is bothering him, he shows no sign of it and bounds into the room before firmly shaking my hand. At 69, he looks very much the elder statesman.</p> <p>But his beginnings, by his own admission, were very different. Major never really knew his father, Tom Major-Ball, who died shortly before his 19th birthday, and wishes he'd asked more questions. He was, he says, Victorian to the core; loving but remote \"with all the virtues and vices of the age into which he was born\".</p> <p>From 1901, Tom spent nearly 30 years on the road as a music-hall artist, for much of that time the proprietor of his own show. He cut his teeth working in circuses and travelling galas, but in 1902 formed a double act with a singer and dancer called Kitty Grant, whom he later married \u2013 performing acrobatics, baton-twirling, patter, comic duets and comedy sketches. They became known as Drum and Major, and topped the bill at big halls such as the Leeds City Varieties. Forty years later, Major was the name on his son's birth certificate.</p> <p>But Kitty wasn't John Major's mother. That distinction fell to Gwen Coates, a Lincolnshire girl who joined the company as a dancer. She stepped into Kitty's shoes when a steel girder from a safety curtain struck the unfortunate woman on the head. On her death bed, Kitty asked her to look after Tom and Gwen married him a year later.</p> <p>As a boy, Major soon realised his parents were more exotic than those of his friends. For a start, they were much older and often mistaken for his grandparents. But they made no attempt to blend into their suburban surroundings, often reprising their stage routine in the back garden. Did they embarrass him? \"Yes, a bit,\" he says fondly. \"But in retrospect, what does it matter? I wouldn't have swapped them for anything.\"</p> <p>Tom and Gwen had three children; John was his mother's \"just-in-time\" baby. \"My father was 64 when I was conceived, my mother 38, which was late for babies in the 1940s. I think she was very ill when I was born \u2013 and so was I. There was some suggestion that neither of us might survive.\"</p> <p>His father was the maypole around whom the family danced. \"I knew him only as an elderly man, but his word was law and he could be quite severe. I came home one day, having finished second in an English exam, and rushed in to tell him. He simply commented that if I'd worked a bit harder, I'd have finished first. But he was never unkind. He often saw the ironic, foolish side of life and was a spectacularly good raconteur.\" He smiles: \"And so far as I was able to find out, most of his stories were true.\"</p> <p>Tom wasn't the most practical of men. He made and lost a fortune several times, but his luck ran out in his early 70s when he lost his savings in a business venture and had to sell their modest but comfortable family bungalow in Worcester Park, south-west London.</p> <p>Bankrupt, they moved into two rooms in Brixton owned by \"Uncle Tom\", who Major later discovered was, in fact, his half brother, the result of his father's affair with a married woman 50 years before. His parents never told him who he really was. \"My father was too lofty to explain, and my mother would have moved heaven and earth to protect me from that sort of thing.\"</p> <p>It was a claustrophobic existence, though his father, long used to theatrical digs, quickly adapted. \"There was my father, mother, sister and myself, a dog and the odd caged bird,\" he says [his elder brother, Terry, had by now moved out]. \"We shared an ancient cooker on the landing with an eccentric neighbour and the communal loo was three doors down. But there are still people who live like that \u2013 and worse \u2013 so I'm not screaming hardship.\"</p> <p>His parents inhabited a Micawberish world in which \u2013 somehow, sometime \u2013 all would be well. But it hardly ever was. \"It was extremely painful for our father, who was a proud man, to find himself bedridden, bankrupt, most of his dreams destroyed and knowing that he depended for his livelihood on a tiny pension and the help his children could provide. But there was never any question that those debts shouldn't be repaid, and we treated it as a collective responsibility. What I didn't know was that my mother often borrowed money from my half brother's wife.\"</p> <p>Ironically, it was his mother, \"a Peter Pan figure who never quite grew up\", who shielded his father. \"Her world centred on him and he accepted her care as his right. In this, if in little else in life, he was a lucky man. It was a special relationship. There were a lot of years between them, but you can't define attraction or the emotions that bring people together. They are mixed, varied and not always easy to understand.\"</p> <p>It's tempting to see Tom as a dreamer who failed to face up to his responsibilities, but Major quickly puts me straight. \"No, he just didn't care about money. Anyone who reads the book will discover this was pretty typical of music-hall artists. My mother was much better with money and would hoard what little there was to see us through.\"</p> <p>It's obvious that young John adored his mother \u2013 he often bought her presents with his hard-earned pocket money. His father may have dominated the family, but his mother was at its heart. \"When something threatened the nest, she'd stamp her foot and everybody wheeled in behind her. It happened rarely, but when it did, it was pretty clear who was running the show.\"</p> <p>Gwen bestowed all her hopes on her younger son, but at a price to him. \"She always wished to know exactly what I was doing, who I was with and what I was going to do next,\" he says without reproach. \"I've called it being possessive, but it was also huge interest. To a substantial extent, she was living her life through her youngest child.</p> <p>\"When she was quite ill, I took her to Spain. In truth, she was like a fish out of water and pretended to like all that wretched hot weather. But what she really liked was the fact that I had cared enough to invite her.\"</p> <p>His mother's death in 1970, after a long illness, came as a surprise but his father's decline eight years before seemed inexorable. When Tom's health deteriorated, he took to his bed and his young son became his audience, listening in awe as he sang the songs and recited the monologues from his music-hall days. The bond between youth and age was very strong.</p> <p>Somehow, word of his father's plight spread and \"careworn and often shabbily dressed\" strangers arrived at their door, former music-hall performers of his father's vintage. Old stories were resurrected and tears often flowed.</p> <p>Inevitably, the curtain had to fall. \"I was with him as he died,\" Major writes movingly in his autobiography. \"I was sitting by his bed and felt the warmth leave his hand. For a man of the theatre, who loved the dramatic, it was a peaceful end.\"</p> <p>It was to her younger son that his mother turned instinctively in her grief. \"She clung to me as though she would never let go,\" he writes. \"She knew the show must go on, but her smile was never again so bright.\" I read these words aloud and his eyes fill with tears. I ask if he wishes me to stop. \"No, no ... that's OK,\" he says with quiet dignity.</p> <p>Poignantly, his parents never lived to see him become prime minister, though his greatest regret is that he wasn't able to share his prosperity and buy his mother new clothes. What would they have made of his achievements? \"My mother would have claimed it was what she had expected all along. My father would have been proud, but wondered why I had gone into politics and where the instinct had come from. We didn't talk about politics at home, though my elder brother and sister said he always blamed the Attlee government for the difficulties his little firm got into in the 1940s and 1950s.\"</p> <p>His background, more classically Labour than Conservative, inevitably changed his outlook. \"It was useful because I saw things I wouldn't have seen, though it often made life quite awkward because my natural instincts were quite adrift from the free-market instinct of a typical Tory. One of the things that upset me most was when some colleagues on the right started being censorious about single mothers and I got the blame. They were emphatically not my views and couldn't have been, given my background.</p> <p>\"I thought I could do something different from any Conservative prime minister before me. But I couldn't. I was trapped with a socking great recession. Shops were closing, people were losing their homes \u2013 all the things I went into politics to avoid \u2013 and I was almost powerless to do anything about it. And then, after handing over the best economy in generations, I watched other people spend the money. So, was that frustrating? You bet it was.\"</p> <p>He never succeeded in shaking off his grey image, and his father's colourful background was often used as a stick with which to beat him. Seemingly, even he came to believe the stereotype, once flatly telling an interviewer: \"Maybe I am just grey and ordinary, like they said.\"</p> <p>But it's hard to reconcile the monochrome Major of folklore with the man before me now, whose emotions are rarely far from the surface. Perhaps the image was too simplistic? \"Most images are,\" he says, but adds: \"Who would have thought, those people who deal solely in image, that I was so interested in theatre and ballet and opera? There's always been a lot of ho-hoing behind the hands about me leaving school with three O-levels. What no one has bothered to say was that as soon as I could read, I read everything. And I qualified as a banker in the evenings after I left school.\"</p> <p>This will sound chippy in print, I warn him. \"I know. I've had to live with that for a long time,\" he says calmly. \"But who cares? I'm no longer public property, so I no longer care what they&#xa0;think.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 My Old Man: A Personal History of Music Hall by John Major is published by HarperPress, \u00a320.

  "<p>On the popular website Reddit, where users submit and share content, a member of&#xa0;a&#xa0;forum called \"creepshots\" was handing out advice last week. His subject? How to photograph women surreptitiously. \"Don't be nervous,\" he wrote. \"If you are, you'll stand out. Don't hover too much, get your shot and move on if you can ... You'll look less like a creep if you have photos of things other than just hot chicks' asses.\"</p> <p>He offered this advice in the comment stream attached to a gallery of photos of women snapped unawares at airports. Those images joined hundreds posted by group members of women waiting for trains, packing groceries, standing on escalators; the camera homing in on their bottom, crotch or breasts. And they joined thousands more on creep websites as a whole, a large, thriving online subculture. The point is to catch women unawares, lay claim to something off-limits, then share it around for&#xa0;bragging rights and comment.</p> <p>Erin Gloria Ryan, a writer for popular women's website <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/\" title=\"\">Jezebel.com</a>, was alerted to the forum by concerned Reddit users who are trying to get it closed, partly because some of the pictures appear to have been taken in schools. The content on the creepshot forum isn't pornography, says Ryan, \"but it is using people's images in ways&#xa0;they definitely wouldn't want authorised\". For group members, she says, it seems to be precisely women's lack of consent \u2013 the violation of their privacy and agency \u2013 that is appealing.</p> <p>The issue of women's pictures being taken and shared without their consent has been in the spotlight for more than a&#xa0;week now because of the furore around topless images of the Duchess of&#xa0;Cambridge. I suspect the most arresting photograph of the scandal will actually prove to be the one&#xa0;that shows where the photographer was apparently standing. An 'x' marks a&#xa0;spot on a public road, so far from the chateau where the couple were staying that you can barely make out the building itself. The perspective makes any argument against the right to privacy seem laughable, yet&#xa0;they continue. The editor-in-chief of&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/19/kate-topless-photos-swedish-magazine?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Denmark's Se og H\u00f8r magazine, which published a 16-page supplement of the photos</a>, has implied Kate must&#xa0;accept some responsibility for \"willingly revealing her breasts towards a public road\".</p> <p>The story prompts questions about why there is such a market, and therefore audience, for these pictures. As others have pointed out, it is not as though there is any dearth of bare breasts, consensually exposed and shared, on the internet. The answer involves a familiar combination of desire and humiliation. There is an interest in seeing not just any breasts, but all breasts, a sense that female bodies are public property, fair game \u2013 to be claimed, admired and mocked.</p> <p>Paparazzi culture has been a problem for decades, but it has taken on an especially sinister, sexualised hue in recent years. In 2008, for instance, a photo agency announced that Britney Spears definitely wasn't pregnant \u2013 by posting pictures of her in period-stained knickers. Emma Watson has said that on&#xa0;her 18th birthday she realised that \"overnight I'd become fair game ... One photographer lay down on the floor to get a shot up my skirt. The night it was legal for them to do it, they did it. I woke up the next day and felt completely violated.\" At the Leveson inquiry, towards the end of 2011, Sienna Miller said that for years she was \"relentlessly pursued by 10 to 15 men, almost daily ... spat at, verbally abused ... I would often find myself, at the age of 21, at midnight, running down a dark street on my own with 10 men chasing me\".</p> <p>While we associate this experience specifically with celebrities, we arguably all live in a paparazzi culture now. Cameras are ubiquitous, as is the technology to share and publicise pictures instantly. The throb of surveillance plays out in different ways. On the more benign side are the mild nerves many people feel when an email pops up to tell them they have been tagged in a Facebook photo, an image that could be from any moment in their life \u2013 recent or historical \u2013 now public, and open for comments.</p> <p>But it also plays out in more insidious ways. This includes the creepshot websites, and others where people collect images of ordinary women they have culled from around the internet. Julia Gray, co-founder of anti-street harassment group <a href=\"http://ldn.ihollaback.org/\" title=\"\">Hollaback London</a>, says she was horrified when a picture of her ended up in one of these groups, an image of her at her best friend's birthday party. \"We were really drunk, I fell over, and my friend took a picture that happened to capture my boobs down my shirt.\" When she saw it in her friend's Flickr album online, she was completely relaxed about it; in that setting it was just an innocent, funny image. But then it was appropriated, \"and in the context of all the other pictures \u2013 upskirt shots and down-top shots \u2013 it became incredibly creepy. All of a sudden it was this weird, voyeuristic thing, and I felt really preyed upon.\"</p> <p>Then there is the evidence that young women are being coerced into taking suggestive pictures by their male peers, badgered in a way that is distinctly paparazzi-like. Teenagers today have grown up in an environment filled with both paparazzi pictures and images of ordinary women with their tops off. We live in the land built by gossip and lads' magazines over the past decade. Heat magazine ran its Circle of Shame feature for years, encouraging young women to look at their female peers, deride them for ugliness, and simultaneously police their own appearance. Nuts magazine went into nightclubs and asked women to flash for them. Zoo magazine asked readers, \"What kind of tits do you want&#xa0;for YOUR girlfriend?\" in a 2005 competition that offered \u00a34,000 worth of&#xa0;surgery in return for pictures of readers' girlfriend's breasts.</p> <p>This has been the formative environment for today's teenagers, and in <a href=\"http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforprofessionals/sexualabuse/sexting-research-report_wdf89269.pdf\" title=\"\">a small-scale but fascinating NSPCC study published this year, researchers spoke to 35 students at two London schools</a>, and found \"peer surveillance and recording was normalised to the extent that many young people felt they had few friends they really 'trusted'\".</p> <p>A girl in her second year at secondary school whom the researchers spoke to reported that the demand \"Can I have a&#xa0;picture of your tits?\" occurred daily. If boys managed to get these photos, they immediately became a form of currency for them, and potential humiliation for the girls. Male interviewees spoke about posting these pictures to \"exposure sites\" on Facebook, profiles set up especially for this purpose.</p> <p>Allyson Pereira, an anti-bullying advocate from New Jersey, has had that experience first-hand. Now in her 20s, she was 16 when her ex-boyfriend \u2013 the first boy she had dated \u2013 said he would get back together with her if she sent him a topless picture. She did, and he immediately \"sent it to everybody in his contact list,\" she says, \"and it just went viral\". She found out when everyone started laughing at her, and calling her a&#xa0;whore. Her mother initially said they would have to move, former friends called her disgusting and teachers made jokes about it. Six months later, Pereira felt so lonely that she attempted suicide. Having planned to become a&#xa0;teacher herself, she abandoned the ambition, because: \"I would have had to explain to every single [employer] about my past, because you never know when a picture like that is going to resurface.\" She didn't go to university, because she felt too vulnerable. The photo is still out there, she's sure, and although her anti-bullying work gives her pride, feels her life will always be tainted. \"I don't like public places,\" she says, \"I'm still bullied sometimes now if I go out. I have people who call me a whore.\"</p> <p>In recent years a genre of websites dedicated to sharing humiliating pictures of women \u2013 and occasionally men \u2013 has cropped up, known as \"revenge porn\" sites. The idea&#xa0;is that vengeful people can post humiliating, sexual pictures of former partners, photos often clearly intended for personal use only, if they were taken with consent at all.</p> <p>Charlotte Laws first encountered these sites in January this year, after her daughter Kayla, who is in her mid-20s, had her computer hacked. In Kayla's email account was one topless photo she had taken of herself \u2013 it hadn't been shared with anyone \u2013 which was then posted on a notorious revenge porn site, Is Anyone Up. She was distraught, and Charlotte, an author and former private investigator, spent 11 days, non-stop, working to get the picture taken down. One of the nastiest aspects of the site, which has since closed, was that humiliating photographs would be posted alongside details of the person's social media accounts, so they were immediately identifiable.</p> <p>Laws wanted to find out more about the experiences of those whose images ended up on the site, so began an informal study. She called 40 people \u2013 a&#xa0;few men, but mainly women, reflecting the site's make-up \u2013 and says that 40% had had accounts hacked, while others were victims of vengeful exes. She spoke to three teachers, one of&#xa0;whom had lost her job due to the site, and another whose job hung in the balance. One woman was terrified the photos would be used against her in a&#xa0;custody battle. Another had seen her business ruined \u2013 even though the nude&#xa0;images the site ran alongside her social media profiles weren't actually of&#xa0;her. There was a woman who had taken pictures for her doctor, of her breasts bandaged after surgery, and those had been hacked from her computer and posted. All the pictures were open to biting discussion of looks and desirability.</p> <p>Laws has been researching possible legal routes for victims of such sites, which has brought her into contact with Mary Anne Franks, associate professor of law at the University of Miami. \"What&#xa0;unites creepshots, the Middleton photographs, the revenge porn websites,\" says Franks, \"is that they all&#xa0;feature the same fetishisation of non-consensual sexual activity with women who either you don't have any access to, or have been denied future access to. And it's really this product of rage and entitlement.\"</p> <p>Franks finds it interesting that the response to these situations is so often to blame the woman involved. Ali Sargent, a 19-year-old student and activist, says in her school years there were a few incidents of girls being filmed in sexual situations, without their knowledge or consent, and the attitude of other girls was dismissive at&#xa0;best \u2013 displaying that dearth of sympathy that distances people from the thought that it could ever happen to them. \"It was mostly just, 'well, she was pretty stupid,'\" says Sargent.</p> <p>Franks echoes this. She says the argument goes: \"'You shouldn't have given those pictures to that person', or 'You shouldn't have been sunbathing in a private residence', or 'You should never, as a woman, take off your clothes in any context where anybody could possibly ever have a camera'. That's been shocking to me, that people aren't just outraged and furious about this, but they're actually making excuses for this behaviour, and blaming women for ever being sexual any time, at all.</p> <p>\"Even in a completely private setting, within a marriage \u2013 it couldn't be any more innocuous than the Middleton situation \u2013 and yet people are still saying things like: what was she expecting, she's famous and she's got breasts, and therefore she's got to keep them covered up all the time. I do think it's a rage against women being sexual on their own terms. We're perfectly fine with women being sexual, as long as they are objects and they're passive, and we can turn them on, turn them off, download them, delete them, whatever it is. But as&#xa0;soon as it's women who want to have&#xa0;any kind of exclusionary rights about their intimacy, we hate that. We say, 'No, we're going to make a whore out of you'.\"</p>",
  "<p>If there is one thing that Chelsea do not need to change in this season of evolution, it is their striker. At least that is what Roberto Di Matteo claims, as doubts again&#xa0;surface about the usefulness of Fernando Torres.</p> <p>The forward started this season with three goals in four matches but his form in Chelsea's last three winless games has been so unconvincing that the criticism he endured for most of last season has reappeared.</p> <p>The former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit, speaking after their 2-2 draw with Juventus on Wednesday, even went so far as to say that with Torres in the team, Chelsea seemed to be playing with 10 men.</p> <p>Di Matteo disagrees and dismissed the idea that it is time to plot a new playing style that dispenses with Torres.</p> <p>\"That is not something we're thinking about,\" the manager said when asked whether, given the array of inventive midfielders at his disposal, he should drop Torres and introduce the sort of striker-less formation that Spain have often deployed.</p> <p>\"We have a forward and we're happy with him and we will soon get [the injured] Daniel Sturridge back, so at the moment our style is fine,\" said Di Matteo, who professed to be perplexed at the notion that Torres contributes little. \"He scored goals from the first game he played this season and he's always keeping defenders busy and moving and doing the right things. Even when he doesn't score he works hard for the team and provides an outlet. I don't see any problem with him.\"</p> <p>Torres admitted during the summer that at one point last season he became so aghast at his own form that he began to feel too \"scared\" to get into positions to score in case he fluffed the opportunities. Critics claim to have spotted signs of similar self-doubt during the draws with Queens Park Rangers and Juventus. That, too, is an idea that Di Matteo dismisses. \"I can't see that, he's full of confidence. He's playing well and scoring goals, though he didn't score in the last couple of games. There are no issues.\"</p> <p>Di Matteo also defended John Obi Mikel, the Nigerian midfielder who was not merely criticised for a costly mistake he made during the draw with Juventus, but was also racially abused on Twitter. Chelsea said they will ban the \"abhorrent\" abusers if they are found to be Chelsea fans and Di Matteo spoke of the need to \"further sensibilise [sic] people to eradicate this not just from football but from society\".</p> <p>Di Matteo also argued that criticism of Mikel's play is misguided. \"He has done extremely well for us,\" he said. \"It's a bit of a dirty job that he's got for us, breaking up the opposition's play and that's why he doesn't always get recognised with the right credit. But that's normal in football, fans normally only fall in love with the exciting players, the goalscoring players.\"</p> <p>On a day spent trying to dispel negativity around Chelsea, Di Matteo also downplayed the significance of Roman Abramovich's visit to the training ground on Thursday. He was said to be so outraged by the way in which Chelsea coughed up a two-goal lead against Juventus that he stormed into the club's complex at Cobham to demand an explanation. Di Matteo insists that is an overly dramatic account of a routine check-up.</p> <p>\"He's been [to the training ground] many times before,\" Di Matteo said. \"He likes to be involved so he comes down whenever he can. He's followed us a lot this season, he even came on the pre-season tour of the United States. He's the owner, he likes to know what's going on and constantly speaks to different people. We're always happy to see him.\"</p> <p>Such a hands-on approach from an employer not noted for his tolerance of disappointment might worry some managers but Di Matteo is unperturbed. \"At big clubs you're always under pressure to win and win well.\"</p>",

Oh, Hayley's baggage is that she eats mashed potato for breakfast. That's not&#xa0;really baggage, is it? She's perfect, I&#xa0;adore her, but we can't be together, because of what she has for breakfast ... that's not going to happen, is it? Lauren knows she died on the Titanic in a previous life. That's a bit better.</p> <p>To be fair, the baggage does get better as it goes on (\"the bigger the bag, the bigger the baggage\" is the catchphrase, the equivalent to <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/takemeout/\" title=\"\">Take Me Out</a>'s \"no likey, no lighty\"), so Hayley, who Gary eventually picks, turns out to be stalker. And Gary himself is a control freak. Their holiday is going to be a giggle. I always think, about these shows, that a hot holiday is quite a high-pressure first date.

Ninety-six balloons will be released before kick-off in memory of those who died, a mosaic reading \"96, Justice and Truth\" will be raised on three sides of the stadium and representatives of the campaign groups will be in attendance.</p> <p>Ferguson and Sir Bobby Charlton may present flowers to be laid in front of the Kop, and Ferguson has also written an emotive letter that will be presented to every United supporter as they enter Anfield. The letter states: \"Our great club stands with&#xa0;our great neighbours Liverpool today to remember that loss and pay tribute to their campaign for justice. I&#xa0;know I can count on you to stand with us in the best traditions of the best fans in the game.\"</p> <p>A small number of Liverpool and United fans have taunted their opposite numbers over the loss of life at Munich in 1958 and at Hillsborough. But after&#xa0;every Manchester City fan marked the 50th anniversary of the Munich disaster with respect at Old Trafford, Ferguson has called for Sunday's meeting between the north-west rivals to draw a similar line under \"obscene\" hostilities.</p> <p>He said: \"I don't think it will change in terms of the animosity towards each other. No question of that. What can change is going beyond the pale \u2013 the chants that refer to Munich or Hillsborough or whatever. So I think that is the end of that. There is a point where you go beyond the pale. And I think in the past it has been that way. You have to remember that it is not all the supporters \u2013 it is a minority. And a minority can create the headlines in order to get a voice.</p> <p>\"They have an opinion and they want to be heard \u2013 an obscene opinion but nonetheless it is there. And it does not reflect the general view or attitude of both clubs. We're talking about four or five hundred supporters on either side that bring their clubs into disrepute or whatever.\"</p> <p>Anti-Liverpool chants during United's win over Wigan Athletic at Old Trafford last Saturday, plus the first meeting between Luis Su\u00e1rez and Patrice Evra since the striker refused to shake the defender's hand in February, have added to the tension. But Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers are adamant that nothing should detract from the recognition being paid to the Hillsborough families and their 23-year fight for the truth.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager said: \"First and foremost it is an opportunity to commemorate the families and pay respect to all of those who have worked tirelessly for over 23 years. Football has been a great support in that, a lot of clubs have given fantastic support, and this is our opportunity to do the same at Anfield. It is an important day and the families deserve that respect from both teams and both sets of supporters.</p> <p>\"It is an emotion-charged game but I won't tell Liverpool supporters how to behave. They are well-educated supporters who value humanity so I see no issue there and the message from Sir Alex to his supporters has been clear too. Once we have paid tribute to the families we will get on with the football.\"</p> <p>Before kick-off, however, the Premier League handshake will bring together Su\u00e1rez and Evra, should he start for United. Rodgers insists he has not spoken about the issue to the Uruguay international, who served an eight-match suspension for racially abusing Evra last season, but is confident the controversy will not be reopened at Anfield.</p> <p>\"I think the whole situation last season was tiring. It just went on and on. We have brought closure to it,\" Rodgers said. \"I can only speak from working with the guy and, both in football and socially, I find him a really good guy.</p> <p>\"He is a good man,&#xa0;very family orientated, very much a team player and is very passionate about football. He is always into training&#xa0;early and never in the treatment room. He is not here to steal a living. Of course he had his incidents last year but people will boo good players no matter what they do.\"</p> <p>Ferguson went to Anfield to pay his respects to the Hillsborough victims in 1989 and United offered Liverpool any support they required in the aftermath of the disaster. As for the panel's findings, he said: \"I didn't read it. I just heard [David] Cameron's speech [when he apologised in Parliament]. It was horrific, absolutely horrific in this day and age. You think it could happen in some South American country but it was quite amazing.\"</p> <p>The United manager also urged his players to play the match rather than the occasion, recalling how difficult his team found it to play against City in the Munich 50th anniversary game in 2008, which they lost 2-1. He believes the match at Anfield could be flat for similar reasons.</p> <p>\"That is a possibility, I don't deny that. Human nature can be that way,\" he said. \"The players for instance when we played Man City in the 50th anniversary, the place was so flat. Even in the dressing room, I felt it before the game we could not perform. I was just happy to get over it. It was such an emotional day for us. I think we should let the players get on with it. There is enough pressure on players, let the game go on.</p> <p>\"We want to make sure we do our best and represent the [club] in the proper way and enjoy ourselves. I think that is the key for us on Sunday \u2013 just to go out and&#xa0;enjoy it. Once the kick-off goes, then go and win the game. That has got to be our attitude.\"</p> <p>Rodgers enters his first meeting with United as Liverpool manager without a league win and admits being \"hurt\" by the transformation of the two clubs' fortunes since growing up with the fixture in the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>He said: \"It does hurt when you've been a club of this standing for so many years and the reality is that you've fallen behind. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that. But it also brings great motivation and enhances my commitment to show that we're going to fight to keep moving forward.</p> <p>\"You can't control everything but certainly what you can control is your spirit and the level to which you look to perform on the field. Hopefully over these coming years we can close the gap. That's the reality of it. Off the field our supporters are the best in the world. But on the field we need to make up the gap for sure.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you are planning an extension or thinking about a self-build project, make sure you have given serious thought to what would happen if the builder goes bust, and whether you would be protected.</p> <p>That's the advice from Ann and Kevin Ruck, who are embroiled in an \"absolute nightmare\" after their builder went into administration before he had finished work on their \u00a3300,000 \"eco house\", a striking wedge-shaped building made with local materials.</p> <p>The couple had handed over almost all the money because it was supposedly more or less finished. But after the builder left the site, it emerged that the Rucks would have to spend tens of thousands of pounds to put right a long list of problems and complete work that was already supposed to have been done.</p> <p>Ann says they have learned, to their cost, that there seems to be little or no consumer protection when a builder goes bust, adding: \"You have more protection when spending \u00a3500 on a package holiday than when spending thousands on building work.\"</p> <p>Their experience could serve as a warning to homeowners thinking about taking advantage of the relaxation of planning rules announced by the government this month, which, some say, could spark a rush to build larger extensions.</p> <p>The Rucks had decided to build an environmentally-friendly home overlooking the sea near Gairloch on the north-west coast of Scotland where \"we could spend some quiet time as we start to work a bit less\".</p> <p>They were keen for it to be a sustainable build, using Scottish materials such as oak and Caithness stone, with the whole property highly insulated for energy efficiency.</p> <p>The builder started work in May 2010 and was supposed to finish six months later, but the work \"dragged on\" until early 2011. In March of that year, the builder wrote to the architect to say he was temporarily ceasing trading \"due to increasing bad debts\", and walked off the site. Shortly afterwards he went into administration.</p> <p>\"We had paid just about all the money and had thought the build pretty well complete, so at first we weren't worried. It wasn't until I got on site that I realised the extent of the problems,\" says Ann.</p> <p>\"The sewage system had not been done as per the contract. There was extensive remedial and completion work including replumbing, electrics, extensive interior plastering, large windows needing to be replaced because they had not been fitted correctly \u2013 it goes on and on.\"</p> <p>This work \u2013 which the Rucks are having to fund out of their own pockets \u2013 is still not finished. They have had to employ another builder and pay a surveyor to investigate potential problems.</p> <p>The couple, who live near Maidstone in Kent, say they thought they had done all the right things. They interviewed four architects before choosing one, while the builder was suggested by the architect but also competed in a tender process. They paid the builder on time, with the architect employed to administer the contract and sign off the work for payment at key stages. \"Yet we find ourselves in this position,\" says Ann, adding that it seems \"everyone is protected except the consumer\".</p> <p>Before work started on the house, Ann asked the architect whether they should take out a National House-Building Council (NHBC) warranty \u2013 which can, in some cases, offer protection if a builder goes bust (see right) \u2013 but he emailed: \"We've never done a building that is NHBC guaranteed. Waste of money. I would hope that all our houses surpass their standards without you having to pay someone to come and do expensive checks.\"</p> <p>Ann says the builder was a limited company with no assets to speak of, so they have been advised there is no point in suing him.</p> <p>She says they may have a case against the architect \u2013 who is a member of Rias, the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland \u2013 on the grounds that he signed off work that was not acceptable to building control. But \"because the builder has gone bust, he is able to use this as his defence \u2013 ie, if the builder hadn't gone bust, he would have made him put it right\".</p> <p>In an email to Ann, the architect said: \"Much as I am furious... and much as I regret the situation, we are not culpable for the fact that [the builder] did not carry out the works in accordance with the specification or rectify the works prior to ceasing trading.\"</p> <p>She says they may be able to make a claim against the architect's professional indemnity insurance, but this would be expensive, \"and, frankly, I don't know that I can afford it\".</p> <p>She adds: \"If people are going to embark on a building project, think about how you are going to be protected should the builder go bust, particularly if it is a limited company and goes into administration.</p> <p>\"The onus here seems to be totally on the consumer to protect themselves, whereas in other situations it's the industry that funds the protection.\"</p> <h2>Ways to avoid problems</h2>",
  "<p>Thousands of flat owners across Britain are handing over vast sums to managing agents to cover service and maintenance charges \u2013 but it doesn't have to be that way.</p> <p>My story explains how it's both possible and practical to break away from these companies using a simple process which, in our case, cut the service charges by more than two-thirds. In the summer of 2009, as a single man in my mid-20s, I moved into my perfect home: a waterfront flat in Cardiff Bay on the top floor of a block of three flats.</p> <p>The view from my balcony is spectacular in all directions, from the Cardiff skyline, to the Wales Millennium Centre, and, on a clear day, across the Severn estuary to the Mendip hills, as well as a stunning array of wildlife on the waterfront.</p> <p>Even now, I cannot believe my luck that I call this flat my home. However, there was just one catch: the managing agents, a controversial company called Peverel OM (now called OM Property Management, part of the Peverel Group) were charging more than \u00a3100 per month in service charges, which I considered excessive.</p> <p>To put it into context, this is a small block of flats with no lift. The only regular services the agents needed to provide were the insurance, cleaning the communal areas and maintaining the garden. Such a small amount of work did not, I felt, merit anything close to the \u00a33,500 they received that year from the three leaseholders.</p> <p>The following December, I received a letter from Peverel OM saying they would be increasing the monthly charge to \u00a3115.25 in the new year. A few weeks later, it sent me the accounts for the previous year.</p> <p>It contained a number of charges which I thought were questionable, the worst being the \u00a3250 they claimed for \"aerial system maintenance\".</p> <p>Two of the three leaseholders watch TV through a satellite dish, and the third has a set-top aerial for his Freeview connection. For me, this was the final straw.</p> <p>I did some research, and discovered that, under the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, we were entitled to remove Peverel OM and set up our own company to manage the block, known as a \"Right to Manage\" (RTM) company.</p> <p>Using one of several online firms specialising in this process, which costs around \u00a3150 per flat, the whole thing took roughly five months from the beginning to the day our RTM company took control. We used a Wirral-based company called <a href=\"http://www.leaseholddoctors.co.uk\" title=\"Leasehold Doctors website\">Leasehold Doctors</a>.</p> <p>The way our company operates is simple: all three leaseholders are directors, but I run it on a day-to-day basis, controlling the bank account and carrying out routine tasks such as renewing the building insurance.</p> <p>However, nobody is more important than anybody else. All major decisions are taken at our annual meeting, and, in the event of any dispute (we've never had one), a vote determines the outcome. Furthermore, because the company was set up as \"limited by guarantee\", we do not have to submit accounts to HMRC or pay any corporation tax, and each director's liability in the event of liquidation is \u00a31. We even have a website: <a href=\"http://rtminfo.com/seager/\" title=\"\">rtminfo.com/seager</a></p> <p>The savings we made in the year that followed were extraordinary. Each leaseholder paid just \u00a310 a month into the RTM bank account for general upkeep, and a gradual build-up of funds for larger repairs, with other payments as and when needed.</p> <p>Under Peverel OM, for example, our insurance was covered by a company called Kingsborough. Its buildings and terrorism insurance premium came to \u00a31,045 for the block.</p> <p>Using a commercial insurance broker, without any special treatment, I reduced that to \u00a3487 for our first year, rising only slightly \u2013 to \u00a3504 \u2013 for the current year. As a result, I pay, on average, around \u00a328 a month to cover things such as my share of the insurance, cleaning of shared areas, communal electricity, plus a little for a rainy day. My neighbour, Peter Downey, a retired lecturer, said: \"I consider it a huge success and feel much happier with the way decisions are taken about the upkeep of the block.\"</p> <p>Two years on, all three flat owners are saving money, and we feel far more comfortable being able to hire our own choice of tradesmen.</p> <p>I do believe most people can, with prudent management, expect to save enough each year for a holiday or a big-screen TV.</p>",
  "<p>HSBC has announced a link-up with the <a href=\"http://www.postoffice.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Post Office</a> that means the bank's customers will be able to access their current accounts at post office counters.</p> <p>From spring next year all nine million HSBC and First Direct personal current account holders will join the 80% of UK debit cardholders who can already make free cash withdrawals at any of the Post Office's 11,500 branches. The partnership deal will also enable the bank's customers to check account balances and make cash and cheque deposits.</p> <p>HSBC had been under pressure from some campaigners to announce such a link-up. However, at the same time, the Campaign for <a href=\"http://www.communitybanking.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Community Banking Services</a> group is concerned the move may give the banking group an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/21/hsbc-branch-closures-keep-banking-local\" title=\"HSBC branch closures spark battle to keep banking local\">excuse to continue closing branches</a>.</p> <p>Among the major banks only Santander has not reached a similar agreement, though some of its current account customers \u2013 those with former Alliance &amp; Leicester current accounts opened before June 2010 \u2013 can access their accounts at post offices. Services available to current account customers at post offices vary depending on the agreements signed by individual banks (see right). You can check which services are available for your bank or building society account on the <a href=\"http://www.postoffice.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Post Office website</a> or call 08457 223 344.</p> <p>HSBC's partnership deal includes the full range of services currently available. In common with most other major institutions, HSBC customers will be able to withdraw cash from their account at post office counters using what is described as \"a cash machine with a face\". Here, you put your bank account debit card into the terminal on the counter, known as a pin pad, and enter your pin. Then the cashier, rather than the machine, dispenses the cash. HSBC current account holders will be able to check their balance by putting their card and number into the pin pad, prompting the cashier to hand over a printed balance, face down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396478458\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348227452801/PostOffice-table-001.jpg\" alt=\"PostOffice table\" width=\"220\" height=\"395\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PostOffice table Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For people who do not like hole-in-the-wall cash machines, or are not used to using them, the personal touch of having someone to help with the process can be reassuring. But for anyone who is really not comfortable operating a pin pad, the Post Office has developed an alternative where they can withdraw cash using a cheque supported by a pre-arranged mandate from their relevant partner bank. HSBC will be offering this service.</p> <p>HSBC customers will be able to make cash deposits into their account by putting their card into the pin pad \u2013 no pin is needed \u2013 and handing the cash to the cashier, who will then issue them with a receipt stamped with the date and amount. Customers of some banks, including Lloyds TSB and Halifax, need to fill in a personalised paying-in slip issued by their bank in order to make a cash deposit. To deposit a cheque, customers will need to put the cheque together with a personalised deposit slip issued by their bank into an envelope, also supplied by their bank. Once they have sealed the envelope, they hand it to the cashier who will give them a stamped receipt.</p> <p>Some institutions including NatWest, Nationwide, Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland have not yet signed up for their customers to be able to deposit either cash or cheques at post offices.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Post Office says it is committed to enabling all UK current account holders eventually to be able to access their current accounts through post office branches. Once HSBC is on board next spring, 95% of all UK debit card holders will be able to withdraw cash from their current accounts at post office counters. The facility to carry out basic banking at local post offices is a boon for many, especially those in remote rural areas who may live miles from the nearest bank branch or fee-free cash machine. Chances are they may be nearer to a post office. The Post Office's UK network of 11,500 branches is bigger than those of all the major high street banks put together. Now an independent business, separated from Royal Mail since 1 April 2012, the Post Office has a branch within three miles of 99.7% of the population and has a commitment to no more branch closures. Many elderly people are also known to feel more secure making cash withdrawals inside a post office rather from a cash machine in the open air.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I wanted to hire a motor home for one week during the school holidays and, searching the web, eventually found that MotorHolme still had a few available. The motor home, I was told, was in Matlock, some 120 miles from our house in Banbury. </strong></p> <p><strong>Not wishing to let our children down, I agreed to the hire. I was told the cost for the week was going to be \u00a3897 plus \u00a312.50 per day for insurance cover. This would be a total of \u00a3992, so we provided our credit card details. We then received an email, which had a&#xa0;link its to terms and conditions. At the time of booking the company deducted the basic hire charges for the motor home, of \u00a3897. However, it has since taken another \u00a3331 for an insurance surcharge that was not covered in our original conversation.</strong></p> <p><strong>Trying to get in contact with the firm has been very difficult. At the time of writing, we still have yet to go on holiday with the hired motor home. I did contact its owner, who sounded genuine and was happy to tell me that everything will be OK.</strong></p> <p><strong>In the meantime, I have blocked MotorHolme from taking anything more from our credit card. What do you know about this firm? </strong><em>DR,</em> <em>Banbury</em></p> <p>Sadly, we know too much about MotorHolme, as we have received a&#xa0;number of complaints about this company from unhappy customers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/mar/09/motorholme-terms-and-conditions\" title=\"\">since we featured the firm in the column in March</a>. At that time, we reported on the case of TH of Sheffield, who complained the company was hiding its major insurance costs in terms and conditions that were only sent after the booking was made.</p> <p>DR has reported that the same thing happened to him, as have others. Readers complain that this is a difficult (and rather aggressive) company to deal with. It quotes a price and omits to point out its insurers then set their price dependent on the driver's record just before the rental begins. Company owner Andrew Hughes says his insurers demand it is done this way because there can often be a long time between a booking and the actual rental, and this risk has to reflect any points on licences.</p> <p>He disputed suggestions that his staff were unpleasant to deal with, saying they operate in the tough holiday bookings environment. He says the vast majority of the 21,000 hires pass off without incident, and that we only hear about the tiny number of unhappy customers.</p> <p>Since DR contacted us, he has taken the hire and described it as unsatisfactory. He said the motor home had several faults and was older than he thought it would be. Also, a refund Hughes promised as a goodwill gesture didn't materialise, though he said that if DR contacted the firm it would be paid. Ultimately, if we were looking to hire a motor home we would not be using this firm. If you are considering using the company we suggest you spend time on the net looking for feedback, and read its T&amp;Cs carefully before you hand over your card details.</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

  "<p>\"It's the buzz,\" Paul Smith says. \"When you capture somebody else's bird, you get a buzz. That's the whole point.\" Smith is a dooman. \"Doo\"&nbsp;is a Scottish word for male pigeon, and doomen keep pigeons.</p> <p>But that's only the half of it. Doomen also keep other people's pigeons. The pigeons are a&nbsp;special type, known as horseman thief pouters. They look quite different from your average feral pigeon \u2013 prettier, prouder, more erect, as if standing to attention at a passing-out parade. They are often bleached peroxide-blond and puff their chests out like Orson Welles in his heyday.</p> <p>Male and female pouters are hot, and they know it \u2013 they attract other pouters back to their hut, and that's where the doomen come in. As soon as their pigeon lands on the roof with its prospective new partner, the dooman whips down the net and bags the bird. The bird is then legitimately theirs and is often sold on. It's kidnapping as competition. Traditional pigeon fanciers often regard doomen as pirates.</p> <p>Flying doos is a working-class sport in Scotland. Smith lives in Muirhouse, a part of Edinburgh far removed from the cosy intellectualism of the festival. Doomen tend to live tough, hard-drinking, sometimes lawless lives. While flying doos does not necessarily keep them on the straight and narrow, it does&nbsp;keep them on a path that is a bit straighter and narrower than it might have been.</p> <p>It's 9am on a hot Sunday in August, and Smith&nbsp;is hungover. He's looking towards the sky&nbsp;and it's&nbsp;hurting his eyes. He was on the beer&nbsp;last night,&nbsp;he&nbsp;says, as he pours us coffee.</p> <p>\"My earliest memory is of my grandad flying them 40 years ago. He and my dad used to take me to the wee pet shop, and the guy used to wear a long white coat, like a doctor. Back then, you could buy pigeons for 50p. That's how I got hooked.\" The most he's paid for a pigeon is \u00a375.</p> <p>Smith says human skill plays a part in his sport, but most of it is down to the bird. \"There are birds who will catch a hen when they meet it, nae trouble, and there are other birds I've had for five years who have never caught a single pigeon.\"</p> <p>He opens the hut and shows me his favourite, a&nbsp;Dutch bird he calls the Tillinator \u2013 plump and primped. He takes a hen out of her cage and holds&nbsp;it out towards the Tillinator, to demonstrate his reaction. \"They blow themselves up to try to make themselves the Don Juan of the pigeon world.\" Sure enough, the Tillinator's chest becomes even more plumped. The birds are kept from mating for as long as possible before being released in order to \"build up steam\".</p> <p>\"That's the one they're all trying to catch, but&nbsp;naebody can catch him. When he gets a hen, he's so sharp, so quick.\" How many birds has the&nbsp;Tillinator caught? \"About 25.\" How long has he had him? \"Five years.\"</p> <p>You need to be patient in the doo business. Smith says he's out there flying two to three hours a night, maybe all day at the weekend, and sometimes he can go weeks without a sniff of a&nbsp;pigeon. There are few doowomen or girls. It has always been regarded as a man's sport, and every man has a story about the domestic strife the birds have caused. Smith says his grandmother used to throw pigeons out of the window when his grandad kept them in the house. Nowadays, Smith's own wife tells him he cares more for his pigeons than he does for her. Is it true? \"Probably 50%. The pigeons never give me grief!\" He laughs. \"If it's a nice day, are you going to sit in there, or stand outside, fly your birds and get a tan?\"</p> <p>Smith talks about his relationship with fellow doomen \u2013 they can be friendly, but there is always an intense rivalry. Do they ever congratulate each other when a rival has lured away a good bird?</p> <p>\"Pfff! Never heard of that yet. Never.\"</p> <p>Six years ago, Smith's teenage son Kevin was murdered \u2013 stabbed by three young men after they stole his scooter. When Kevin died, Smith lost interest in his pigeons. \"I couldn't feed them \u2013 my brother came down and fed them for me. I couldn't do anything. It takes time, and it never goes away.\" Now at least, he says, his love of flying has returned. All those hours outside with the birds is thinking time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://robertormerod.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Robert Ormerod</a> started taking photographs of doomen more than a year ago. Everything about them is fascinating, he says \u2013 the passion, the lifestyle, the battles, the birds themselves. Many doomen live unpredictable lives and are hard to track down \u2013 they might agree to a photograph one day and not want to know you the next. Ormerod is driving us to the Niddrie estate, which became infamous for gangs and knife crime, and has now been largely demolished. We are here to speak to two boys he has photographed \u2013 one 18-year-old who already has two children, and his younger brother, who's nine. Ormerod warns about their two huge dogs, which can&nbsp;be intimidating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396581878\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348048468827/Pigeon-fanciers-in-Edinbu-008.jpg\" alt=\"Pigeon fanciers in Edinburgh\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Father and son Ian and Mark Wilson dye their newest pigeons yellow in the Southhouse area of Edinburgh.

Only the nine-year-old is home, but he doesn't want to talk to us today and we are sent packing. Another young man says he will talk only for money. So we drive to the south of Edinburgh, to meet 56-year-old Iain Wilson and his daughter, Sinead. It's 11am and he offers me a beer. Wilson is a plumber and runs one of the two shops operating out of Edinburgh where doomen trade pigeons. Flying doos, he says, is an addiction. \"I caught a curse. It's like smoking. You cannae give them up.\" Which is more dangerous? \"The same degree,\" he says. The pigeons produce dust that is easily inhaled. \"I've had part of one of my lungs removed because of dust-related injuries.\"</p> <p>His obsession with the birds dates back to his boyhood. \"My mother and father had nae love of&nbsp;animals at all, so, much to their annoyance, I&nbsp;used to bring injured pigeons home.\"</p> <p>How did they react? \"They looked at it as a hobby and were relieved I wasn't going about the streets throwing stones at windows.\" Does he think he'd have got into trouble otherwise? \"Probably, aye. I&nbsp;had good friends, not hardened criminals; we'd just do a wee bit of shoplifting now and then.\"</p> <p>Why was he so taken with pigeons? \"I was fascinated by something that could fly that comes back to you. You get an affinity with them. Certainly with the horseman. I used to have a&nbsp;pigeon that followed me all the way to the pub.\"</p> <p>He feeds them only the best food, he says. \"Sinead, show Simon.\" Sinead returns with a&nbsp;bucket of food that could pass for nibbles at an upmarket party. \"Sunflower seeds, barley, maize, maple peas, wheat, barley \u2013 I used to eat it when I&nbsp;was waiting for the racing pigeons. So they get the best grub; no rubbish.\"</p> <p>As he talks, he keeps an eye on the sky and catches sight of a hen coming in to land. \"Bop. Bohop bhop. Ooop. Cooo,\" he warbles gently.</p> <p>Can you be a good dooman without talking to the pigeons? \"No, you've got to talk the language. You've got tae have some affinity with the birds. Good pigeons respond.\"</p> <p>These days it's Sinead who plays Florence Nightingale to hurt birds. \"If my mates find an injured pigeon, they'll always bring it to me because I cannae turn it away,\" she says. \"They wouldnae take it to my dad, though, because he'd kill it. He's only interested in pigeons who work.\"</p> <p>\"I'll be perfectly honest with you,\" Wilson says. \"I'm brutal with killing pigeons. If pigeons dinnae perform for you, you've got to kill them. Either that or you'd have thousands. I either pull their neck or tap them on the back of the head.\"</p> <p>He hopes that if Sinead becomes a fully-fledged doogirl, it will keep her out of trouble. \"Well, it doesn't matter if it's pigeons or whatever \u2013 you want your children to have some sort of thing, because there's absolutely nothing for children to do here. It is quite a drugs-dominated place, a lot of coke. Very high unemployment. Everybody that flies in this scheme beyond me and my son dinnae work.\" He pauses. Mind you, he says, you can get into plenty of trouble flying doos. Sinead smiles knowingly and says nothing. \"In the old days, there'd be murder,\" Wilson continues. \"Huts burnt down. Glasgow was the worst. You strive for years to get good pigeons, then if someone comes into your hut and steals them, it makes your blood boil. Once you get a good pigeon, everybody knows about it.\"</p> <p>Has he ever got into trouble over the birds? \"Touch wood I've never had that scenario, because I think people know, were that to happen, there'd be repercussions. The majority in the scheme are frightened of me.\" Physically frightened? \"Aye.\" Because he's tough? \"I don't know whether I'm tough now, but I used to be. I'm getting a bit old. I've hung up my gun belt. I mostly keep the peace. My son, he's a hot-headed one.\"</p> <p>It's funny, Wilson says, sometimes he wonders why he still dedicates so much of his life to the birds \u2013 there's his lungs, the time, the money. \"The worst thing is that it brings out emotions that it shouldn't bring out.\" Such as? \"Anger. There are times you want to kick people around the street. I think it triggers off emotions that you wouldn't normally have in everyday life. Extreme emotions, aye. I could be sitting in the pub having a laugh. Instead, I'm standing in this garden going off my head at the pigeons.\"</p> <p>So why does he keep doo-flying? \"Pure addiction. Aye, it ruins your life.\" Then he sees a&nbsp;pigeon coming in, smiles with relief, and welcomes it home with a warble.</p>",

On one side, it adds a dewy, youthful glow to the face that many of us would love (and routinely try to replicate with cream blushers, illuminators and glosses). On the other, shiny skin rarely holds make-up well, is usually a sign of excess oil and an ever-present threat of breakout, and can look a little sweaty and undone come the afternoon.</p> <p>The problem with many anti-shine&#xa0;products is that they can make&#xa0;skin look chalky and patchy, because they over-absorb grease and&#xa0;replace it with powder and silicone. Others strip so&#xa0;much oil that they leave skin frantically producing more to overcompensate, so exacerbating the shine problem.

  "<p>That morning, I got the train as always. I was a&#xa0;publishing director and was looking forward to reading my newspaper, as usual. I&#xa0;would always turn to the cryptic crossword, but that day it didn't make any sense. I'd been doing it for 30-odd years, but trying to read this one was like treading through treacle: incredibly slow and hard. I&#xa0;thought I must be tired.</p> <p>At the office, I sat down, turned on my computer and found I couldn't read the message on the screen. I&#xa0;said to my assistant, \"This is strange, I can't make my computer work\", and she started laughing. Although I had no idea at the time, I&#xa0;was speaking gibberish.</p> <p>Eventually, worried colleagues contacted my wife, Beth, and she drove me straight to hospital. There, confirmation came that I'd had a stroke in the part of my brain that deals with communication. I was now suffering from aphasia, a condition that means it's difficult or impossibe to receive and produce language. When Beth asked the consultant how long it would take for me to get better, he replied, \"How long is a piece of string?\"</p> <p>Over that first day, I got progressively worse. I couldn't understand what people were saying; I couldn't speak intelligibly; I&#xa0;couldn't read or write. A couple of nights later, I had to go to the loo and realised I couldn't read the signs on the doors. That was the first time I thought, \"Christ, this is serious.\" It was the only time I cried.</p> <p>I was back at home a week later, and my goal was to get better and return to work in a couple of months. I started seeing a speech therapist three times a week, and was given homework to help rebuild my vocabulary and grammer. I'd&#xa0;look at simple pictures and try to describe them as my mind wandered round and round in the darkness, looking for words.</p> <p>Apart from being incredibly tired, and sleeping for hours and hours, I&#xa0;felt healthy. But I was deeply confused. Sitting around the table with my wife and children, all I could hear was a babble of noise. I couldn't separate sounds, be it a dog barking outside, music in the background or my wife talking to me. It was hugely frustrating. After a month, my own speech became functional \u2013 \"Could you pass the salt?\" \"Shall we go for a&#xa0;walk?\" \u2013 but I couldn't have a conversation. I couldn't read the newspaper. When I sat down to my favourite television programme, The Sopranos, I couldn't understand a thing. I felt isolated.</p> <p>People at work were fantastically supportive, but as the months passed it became clear I wasn't going to be able to go back to my old job. I&#xa0;still couldn't read properly, or have a phone conversation. The phrase that kept going through my mind was: damaged goods. For 25 years, I&#xa0;had defined myself as a publisher. I&#xa0;was used to a&#xa0;busy day of meetings, and bringing three manuscripts home with me each night. I enjoyed colleagues, I&#xa0;enjoyed working with writers and the status I'd had. I loved reading books and the sustenance of new ideas. I didn't feel ready to say goodbye to my old self. There were times when I felt incredibly angry.</p> <p>In the darkest months, I devoted myself to trying. I would spend hours writing a description of something simple like a pencil, which would run over two pages. I couldn't manage novels or newspapers, so I&#xa0;tried reading poetry, and found the&#xa0;shorter lines less overwhelming. My speech came back, and I learned how to read again, albeit much more&#xa0;slowly. I also learned patience, and the ability to zone out of conversations when I couldn't keep up. I spent more time outside, looking after our garden, and eventually got a job a couple of days a week at a nursery. I allowed myself to slow down, and started to enjoy it.</p> <p>Gradually, I sloughed off my old skin. I grieved the past, its passing and its absence, and started to come to terms with it. Now, 10 years later, I look after my grandson a day a&#xa0;week, and my relationship with my family is deeper than ever. We have learned to be very patient with each other. If you'd asked me 15 years ago to rank the importance of the things in my life I might have said family, but in truth my all-consuming job was up there as well. I'm no longer a&#xa0;high-achieving publisher or someone who reads 10 books a week. I'm a family man and gardener with aphasia, and if I read 10 books a year, that's pretty good.</p> <p>\u2022 For more information on aphasia, visit Connect at <a href=\"http://www.ukconnect.org\" title=\"\">ukconnect.org</a>. <br>As told to Becky Barnicoat <br>Do you have an experience to share?

  "<p>Sexual intercourse began in 1963, noted Philip Larkin, between the end of the Chatterley ban and the Beatles' first LP. The career of Indian classical music in the western world began roughly three years later, when George Harrison, alerted to Ravi Shankar's virtuosity by the Byrds, took a short crash course in the sitar from the Indian musician.</p> <p>Despite being an Indian, I came, like many of my age and background in 1970s Bombay, to Indian classical music via the Beatles. The history of this music is subject to constant reinvention, and can't be vouchsafed for in any one story. For 20 years I practised classical singing \u2013 the form called the <em>khayal</em> \u2013 eschewing my former western pop affiliations, until, after beginning to listen again to the blues, I thought I heard the riff to Derek and the Dominoes' \"Layla\" in some notes I was singing while practising <em>raga Todi</em>: that was the beginning of my own musical experiment.</p> <p>The music itself goes back at least to the centuries leading up to and just after Christ's birth, which is roughly the era of the composition of the <em>Natya Shastra </em>(meaning the \"art of performance\"), the earliest known text in which Indian music is theorised. This canonical work, like others from Sanskrit, caught the attention of British Orientalist scholars; but the British colonial was contemptuous of the music itself \u2013 which sounded to him or her like an alarming cacophony \u2013 and stayed emphatically disengaged from it. That much is typical, even understandable. Understandable, because no classical tradition in music is easily comprehensible to the ear of the lay populace, let alone to outsiders. Add to this the microtonal explorations of Indian music and the incredible mathematical complexity of its approach to rhythm, and you have some idea of why the ordinary English ear (not to mention the Indian one) might have been baffled. Typical, because the discrepancy between British scholarly interest in Indian classical heritage (which included the rediscovery of temples and of texts like the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>) and colonial indifference to developments in the arts \u2013 literature, painting, classical and modern music - in modern (by which I mean 19th- and 20th-century) India is symptomatic. Still, this indifference counted for little to the many decisive innovations in the realm of north Indian classical music, as it did to modern literature and painting, mainly because of the subterranean patronage of the Indian middle class, and its investment \u2013 despite its privileging of the sciences \u2013 in the arts.</p> <p>The relationship the middle class had with north Indian classical music from the mid-19th century onward was hardly lacking in ambivalence. It was identified with the prostitutes' quarters, and with the bazaar, where its most accomplished practitioners were reportedly found. The <em>Natya Shastra</em> attests to the fact that music was already a classical art in ancient India; but some of the foundations on which its present incarnation rests were laid during the cross-cultural Hindu-Muslim ferment of the Mughal period. In fact, many of the most far-reaching developments in vocal music took place when the Mughals were already in terminal decline, in the court of the reprobate Muhammad Shah, and then under the patronage of Wajid Ali Shah of Awadh, just prior to the East India Company's ascendancy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396427325\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/19/1348065882623/Chitrangana-Agle-Reshwal-008.jpg\" alt=\"Chitrangana Agle-Reshwal\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chitrangana Agle-Reshwal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time the middle class began to show a grudging but genuine curiosity, it had become, by the new standards of 19th-century India, disreputable, and had to, in a sense, be Vedantaised \u2013 that is, linked to the scriptural and spiritual legacies of ancient (Hindu) India that were then being resurrected, secularised, and given to Indians as a \"high\" cultural past. Yet take to this music the middle class did, despite its misgivings. The emergence of <a href=\"http://www.ravishankar.org/\" title=\"\">Shankar</a> marks how irrevocably classical music journeyed from the old musical families towards the bourgeoisie: Shankar, born in Banaras to a <em>bhadralok</em> (bourgeois) Bengali family, was the son of a Middle Temple lawyer. By the mid-1950s, when <a href=\"http://www.menuhin.org/\" title=\"\">Yehudi Menuhin </a>discovered Shankar and his brother-in-law <a href=\"http://www.ammp.com/\" title=\"\">Ali Akbar Khan</a>, the great sarod player, and roughly 10 years before it was glamorised by the Beatles, it's safe to say that Indian classical music and its daunting intricacies had, for whatever reason, become a matter of national pride.</p> <p>Once he'd got over his first hesitation, Shankar was keen to disseminate his music to the west, and also take advantage of the receptivity of the flower children. It was a coincidence that Shankar (like his brother-in-law) was one of India's greatest maestros and innovators, because popular fame for South Asian artists in the west is often capriciously granted and unrelated to merit and judgment. Shankar, despite benefiting from the Harrison association, was anxious to dissociate Indian music from mood-enhancing drugs and psychedelia; he was only slightly successful. After tuning his instrument for five minutes at the <em>Concert for Bangladesh</em> and receiving warm applause, he took pains to say that he hoped the audience would enjoy the actual performance equally.</p> <p>Besides Menuhin, among the first western musicians to listen to him carefully were Jimi Hendrix and John Coltrane. Comparisons with jazz became habitual, given both Indian classical music and jazz were putatively improvisatory. Shankar, who was curious about other musical traditions, and would have been exposed to Coltrane's increasingly atonal free improvisations, was anxious, again, to shoot down the analogy. Yes, there was improvisation in Indian music, but only within stringent conventions governing its two fundamentals: the <em>raga</em>, a pre-ordained progression of notes, and <em>tala</em>, the time-signature, which was absolute, and despite the artist's high spirits, needed to be strictly adhered to.</p> <p>Yet there is a convergence between jazz and Indian classical music, and it arises from the blues: a five-note pentatonic scale from which both jazz and rock are engendered, and which is also to be found in abundance in Indian music. Considering the blues leads us to further convergences. The bent notes blues guitarists play on their instruments are unusual in western music; the principal intention of the bent notes, achieved by pulling on the strings sideways, is, surely, to approximate the voice, and the peculiar plangency of blues singing in particular. Bent notes are rendered with a degree of alarming virtuosity by sitar players, especially by those who pursue the<em> gayaki ang</em> or the \"vocal interpretation\", reproducing the intricate coloratura and glissandos of Indian classical singing with their fingers. One such exponent is Ustad Shujaat Hussein Khan, son of the late Vilayat Khan (Shankar's main rival as India's leading sitar player), an artist whose music has great emotional richness. He'll be performing, with other leading Indian musicians, at the Darbar Festival in London this week.</p> <p>The blues instructs us about the primacy of the human voice in expressing emotions; the<em> gayaki ang</em> is a reminder that the voice, with its suppleness, its ability to render microtones, is the basis of Indian classical music. Some of those microtones can be heard in the blues too, and this explains how Harrison, who'd early on developed a taste for Bo Diddley, was, in a sense, prepared for Shankar's music. It also explains why our ears are more attuned than ever to understanding the exceptionally subtle beauty of this tradition, why we have travelled such a long distance from the British colonial.</p> <p>There's no easy path bringing west and east together in music; but, in the world we inhabit today, the passage from the one to the other is at once unexpected and unavoidable.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Moment of Mishearing</em>, an audio-visual show about Amit Chaudhuri's music, will take place at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on-book-tickets/spoken-word/amit-chaudhuri-and-his-band-a-moment-of-mishearing\" title=\"\">King's Place, London N1, on 6 October</a>.</p> <h2>Listen to Amit Chaudhuri's music</h2> <p> <br>Chaudhuri's gorgeous take on Gershwin's famous Summertime from the American composer's 1935 opera Porgy and Bess.</p> <p><br>One Fine Day, an original composition and arrangement by Amit Chaudhuri, from the album Found Music.</p> <p><br>His arrangement of Good Vibrations, incorporating ragas Kalavati and Abhogi.

  "<p>In 1943, Italy, having signed the act of capitulation to Germany, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_invasion_of_Albania\" title=\"\">withdraws from the Albanian territory</a> which it has occupied since 1939 and German troops enter the country under the guise of liberators. Their first stop is the ancient stone city of <a href=\"http://wikitravel.org/en/Gjirokast%C3%ABr\" title=\"\">Gjirokast\u00ebr</a>. Among the citizens there are two doctors who carry the same name, Gurameto: the heftier one is called Big Dr Gurameto, the other Little Dr Gurameto. To everyone's surprise, the Nazi commander, Fritz von Schwabe, recognises in Big Dr Gurameto an old friend from their university days.</p> <p>Von Schwabe has changed \u2013 he is, of course, older, scarred by fighting \u2013 but Big Dr Gurameto acknowledges his former comrade and invites him to dine at his house. However, the Albanian resistance, which long fought the Italian invader, now turns its efforts against the German one, and snipers start shooting German motorcyclists. As a reprisal, 100 Gjirokast\u00ebr citizens are taken hostage.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the dinner still takes place in Big Dr Gurameto's house and somehow, during the conversation with his old friend, the doctor manages to convince him to spare the hostages, including a Jewish pharmacist. The next day, the Germans leave the city. Though there has never been any rivalry between the two Gurametos, Big Dr Gurameto is now hailed as a hero for having saved the city, while Little Dr Gurameto is scorned.</p> <p>After the war, the newly instituted communist regime accuses Big Dr Gurameto of collaborating with the Nazis, and both doctors, linked in the authorities' mind by their common name, are arrested and tortured. Big Dr Gurameto realises that the man they take to be his colleague is someone else. And among the proofs of his alleged treachery is the fact that the man he invited to dinner 10 years earlier could not have been Commander von Schwabe, who was killed on the front a few months earlier. Who then are these presences, these impostors?</p> <p>In <em>The Fall of the Stone City</em>, first published in 2008 and now brilliantly translated by John Hodgson, Ismail Kadare's subject, as always, is the presence of the past. In Kadare's Albania, a country that has suffered under consecutive dictatorships \u2013 the Ottoman empire, Italian fascism, German nazism, communism \u2013 the dead and the living share the everyday stage on which official lies and private pretence build up a setting of deceit and incredulity in which nothing is as it seems. Against the backdrop of the unreal city, a maze of stone with its back to the wolf-haunted mountains, overlooking gentle Greek-minority settlements along the river, rumours and plots, betrayals and threats, old tales and new occurrences cast a doubt on everything that might be called history. It is said that the girls from the neighbouring villages are kidnapped and taken to Gjirokast\u00ebr, or perhaps they drifted there of their own free will. \"No one knew what went on inside. Were they wretched there or happy? Perhaps their dream of becoming ladies had come true. Or perhaps they themselves had been only a dream, and nothing else.\"</p> <p>We are accustomed to historical fiction that pretends to be factual: poetic licences are contritely confessed in an afterword and critics are keen to point out anachronisms or impossibilities. Kadare has never been interested in archaeological fidelity. In his admirable and vast literature (more than 20 novels to his name), mythology and history are equally competent to bear witness, except that the former is better at illuminating facts than the latter at reporting them. Kadare's contemporaries are not only the victims and victimisers of his sad century, but also the men and women who fought on the plain of Troy and in the legendary places of the Albanian epics. In his books, there is no facile comparison between past and present, but a profound understanding of our common tragedies, of their constancy, fluidity and pathos.</p> <p>In telling the story of <em>The Fall of the Stone City</em>, Kadare has perhaps taken as his model the terrible last scene of <em>Don Juan</em>, the dinner that the hero offers the dead Comendador. But what is hubris in the Spanish tragedy is humility here: the resigned acceptance of past ghosts who will not disappear or find rest. As the novel unfolds, the borders between the material and the dream worlds blur even further, the characters and features blend, fact and fiction merge into each other until finally, on the last page, though \"there was no evidence anywhere to show what really occurred at the most ineffable moment of Big Dr Gurameto's life\", the reader is offered a revelation (which should not be betrayed in a review) more astonishing and truthful than any mere documentary chronicle.</p> <p>\u2022 Alberto Manguel's <em>A Reader on Reading</em> is published by Yale.</p>",
  "<p>You might think that there is nothing new to say about the pre-Raphaelites and their women. And on the evidence of this book you'd be absolutely right. Perhaps, though, this is to miss the point. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/the-pre-raphaelites\" title=\"\">pre-Raphaelite brotherhood</a> and their consorts \u2013 those milliners and shopgirls who turned themselves into Arthurian heroines with a shake of their crinkly hair and a sweep of some old brocade curtains \u2013 have become a kind of foundational myth of the 19th century, one that appears to bear endless retelling.</p> <p>But how many times, really, do we need to hear how Lizzie Siddal nearly caught her death while posing in a tin bath as Ophelia? Or how high-minded <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Holman_Hunt\" title=\"\">Holman Hunt</a> spent money he didn't have on finessing barmaid Annie Miller into a lady? Or how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/mar/27/william-morris-iceland-ian-mcqueen\" title=\"\">William Morris</a> married ostler's daughter Jane Burden, only to lose her to his mentor Rossetti, who in turn was fretting over the fact that he'd buried his best poems in Lizzie Siddal's coffin and just might have to dig her up? These stories might have the lulling circular rhythm of well-loved fairy tales, but their magic depends on their being told with rare feeling. Trot them out once too often and they start to seem shabby and thin.</p> <p>And \"shabby and thin\", really, is what we are dealing with here. Henrietta Garnett rehearses these lovely ballads without adding anything new. Although nominally concerned with the pre-Raphaelites' consorts rather than the roaring boys themselves, she has no choice but to use the men as both the spine and the beating heart of her narrative. And so we find ourselves back inside that little house in Gower Street in September 1848 when a clutch of Royal Academy students barely out of their teens swear to shake up the sclerotic art scene by returning it to the bracing pieties of the quattrocento.</p> <p>Only once the young men are established on their journeys \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/gallery/2007/may/15/2\" title=\"\">Millais</a> to Ewell to look for a pool in which to drown Ophelia, Hunt to the Holy Land to learn how to paint goats, and Rossetti to general perdition \u2013 do the stunners start to settle in to the story. Found in shops, pubs or simply the street, these odd-looking girls with their columnar necks and bruised mouths find themselves wrenched out of their drudging daily lives and projected into a world of stately archetypes. Under the archaizing gaze of their fogey-ish lovers, these modern city girls become goddesses, queens, madonnas and penitent whores.</p> <p>And that, really, is pretty much how they remain in Garnett's strangely inert account. For although recent scholarship has done much to emphasise Lizzie Siddal as a talented artist in her own right (you can see her work at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/31/pre-raphaelites-ybas\" title=\"\">the Tate's new blockbuster exhibition</a>), you certainly wouldn't guess it from Garnett, who dismisses Siddal's paintings in a couple of sentences as \"derivative\" while spending pages on her lustrous hair and laudanum habit.</p> <p>Likewise Jane Morris gets virtually no credit for leading the revival in needlework skills that became such an integral component of the arts and crafts movement of the 1870s and beyond. Instead, sultry Jane is confined to a narrative that dwells in immense detail on her anguished triangle with Morris and Rossetti. While we hear all about her posing as Astarte, Mariana and Proserpine, her exquisite embroidery is shuffled off to a couple of scenes in which she stitches quietly in the background. In one she's even lying on a sofa.</p> <p>Less easy to blank out are Effie Gray, who married first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/mar/29/aesthetic-movement-john-ruskin\" title=\"\">John Ruskin</a> and then John Everett Millais, and Georgie MacDonald, who became Mrs Burne-Jones. While both had the required pre-Raphaelite look \u2013 fragile pallor, thick brown hair \u2013 neither became regular models for their husbands or their friends. Mostly this was a class thing: women could not become \"public\" faces without courting the suspicion that the rest of them was up for sale too. But it might also be that Effie and Georgie's upbringing as the daughters of professional men gave them a sense of identity that could not be overridden simply by being told to hold very still and imagine themselves as Guinevere. They were too singular, too much themselves, to be of use as muses.</p> <p>Both women set out from the provincial middle class and ended married to baronets. The difference was that Effie endured an early chilly marriage to an impotent Ruskin before finding the kind of luxurious love that suited her so well with Millais. Georgie, by contrast, was engaged in a love match at the age of 15 to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/aug/25/last-pre-raphaelite-maccarthy-review\" title=\"\">Edward Burne-Jones</a> and enjoyed years of happiness before the marriage almost broke down under the strain of Ned's affair with Maria Zambaco, the Anglo-Greek heiress who became the go-to model whenever a particularly tempting temptress was required.</p> <p>None of this is remotely new. Indeed, <em>Wives and Stunners</em> reads as if it were loosely stitched-together from fine existing biographies of individual pre-Raphaelites by the likes of Fiona MacCarthy, Jan Marsh and Angela Thirlwell. If you really want to get a proper sense of what we know now about how these people lived and worked, you would do much better to buy the catalogue for the Tate show, <em>Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde</em>. In it there are essays by leading scholars such as Elizabeth Prettejohn that deftly link deep knowledge about individual works of art with the social, human context in which they were made. In the process, women who languish in Henrietta Garnett's book as \"wives\" or \"stunners\" spring to life as proper historical actors, participants in a rich and surprising story rather than empty vessels waiting to be filled with ancient gossip.</p> <p>Kathryn Hughes's<em> The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton</em> is published by Fourth Estate.</p>",
  "<p>In a hotel beside a Norwegian fjord, encircled by snow-streaked mountains, the novelist and playwright <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuruddin_Farah\" title=\"\">Nuruddin Farah</a> has his mind on warmer waters.\"Are they pirates?\" he says of the Somalis who hold ships hostage off the Horn of Africa, where he was born. \"What they do has the characteristics of piracy. But that wasn't how it started.\" He fixes his eye on the Arctic trawlers in the harbour. \"The majority were fishermen who lost their livelihoods to Korean and Japanese and European fishing vessels, fishing illegally in Somali waters. I'm not condoning the things they're doing. But there are unanswered questions. Someone is not telling us the truth.\"</p> <p>Over 45 years, Farah has pursued complex, elusive truths as one of Africa's greatest novelists, and a cosmopolitan voice in English-language fiction. He was driven into exile by the Somali dictator <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-mohamed-said-barre-1566452.html\" title=\"\">Mohamed Siad Barre</a>, who ruled from 1969 to 1991, and he now lives in Cape Town. But all 11 of his novels (translated into 20 languages) are set in Somali-speaking lands, one impulse being to \"keep my country alive by writing about it\". When I first met him in London in the 1980s, he was with Salman Rushdie at a Royal Court play, and his became a staunch Muslim voice against the fatwa. Rushdie writes in his new memoir of seeking his friend's advice on how to depict a country lost to him: \"'I keep it here,' Nuruddin said, pointing to his heart.\"</p> <p>For Nadine Gordimer, Farah is one of the continent's \"real interpreters\". Aged 66, he has lived in 10 African countries and is often cited by other African writers as overdue for the Nobel. His novels scourge received opinion \u2013 whether of female inferiority (he writes women characters who make their own destinies), religious dogma, nationalism (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Maps-Nuruddin-Farah/dp/0140296433\" title=\"\"><em>Maps</em></a>), foreign aid (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=gifts+nuruddin+farah&amp;tag=googhydr-21&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=9682614392&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=1145084661748327081&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;ref=pd_sl_18e0wod9c8_e\" title=\"\"><em>Gifts</em></a>) or clannism (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Secrets-Nuruddin-Farah/dp/0140280456/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347633498&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\"><em>Secrets</em></a>). They trace the history of a region long an arena for proxy wars and great power rivalries, in an oblique, metaphorical style that marries proverbial wisdom (\"a dead man's shoes are more useful than he is\") with daily life in a modern African state awash with sim cards and AK47s.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/crossbones-by-nuruddin-farah-book-review.html\" title=\"\"><em>Crossbones</em></a> is the final volume of a trilogy, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/82898-past-imperfect\" title=\"\">Past Imperfect</a>, set in the civil war that erupted when Siad Barre was ousted. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/16/featuresreviews.guardianreview9\" title=\"\"><em>Links</em></a> (2004) a Dante scholar returns to the seaside capital Mogadishu to find StrongmanNorth and StrongmanSouth battling with US Marines in the infernal, Italianate ruins. In <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/books/review/deBellaigue.t.html\" title=\"\"><em>Knots</em></a> (2007) a Canadian-Somali actress arrives as the warlords have been vanquished by bearded men in white robes, foisting \"body tents\" on women. By <em>Crossbones</em>, the ascendant Islamists \u2013 whom Farah terms \"religionists\" \u2013 are spoiling for war with Ethiopia, while piracy proliferates off the breakaway coastal region of Puntland.</p> <p>I spoke to Farah as a peace process was under way in Somalia that culminated in the inauguration last Sunday of the country's first elected president in decades. The author was in Troms\u00f8, a tranquil town of clapboard houses and silver birch trees 360km north of the Arctic Circle,&#xa0;to address global Ibsen experts. He was already \"pregnant\" with his first published novel, <em>From a Crooked Rib</em> (1970), when he read Ibsen's plays as a student of philosophy&#xa0;and literature in India. The novel-in-progress was the tale of a fight&#xa0;for selfhood in a world where women are \"sold like cattle\", told through the eyes of a 19-year-old nomadic woman. \"I could&#xa0;not have written <em>From a Crooked&#xa0;Rib </em>if I had not read <em>A Doll's House</em>,\" he said at Troms\u00f8&#xa0;University. Growing up in Somalia and Ethiopia, and studying in India, he tells me, \"I saw, on a daily basis, women beaten, girls not sent to school, and the injustices meted out to women. But at 19 or 20&#xa0;I&#xa0;lacked&#xa0;the&#xa0;courage to articulate it.\" The gulf between Ibsen's Nora and his unlettered pastoralist clarified his task: \"For Ebla, even in a metaphorical&#xa0;sense, there was no door to slam.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/crooked-Rib-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/0141187174\" title=\"\"><em>From a Crooked Rib</em> became a Penguin Modern Classic in 2004</a>. At a time when fiction in Africa was more focused on colonial power and emerging nationhood, Farah scrutinised the intimate power play between men and women. The novel was subversive in other ways. Some women berated Farah for trespassing on their realm for exposing the horror of female genital mutilation practised among Somalis (a&#xa0;practice banned last month under Somalia's new constitution).</p> <p>His second trilogy was conceived when he returned to Somalia in 1996, for the first time in 22 years, and was taken hostage by a minor warlord. In Kismayo, \"I was kept incommunicado for a few days. The warlord sent a technical [vehicle] with 16 gunmen; he'd been told wrongly that I was a journalist, and wanted me to write an article praising him.\" The warlord's sister-in-law pleaded for Farah's release: he had been her school teacher in the early 70s. Reconsidering, his captors demanded that he deliver lectures. He complied, since there was nowhere to escape to. He shrugs at the absurdity: \"I was held hostage and gave lectures to the community.\"</p> <p>Later in Mogadishu, he was \"shocked by the destruction. It was a country I didn't recognise, and many of the people in it were newcomers.\" Since the 10th century, he argues, Mogadishu had been a cosmopolitan city-state, but with the civil war, \"it lost its old inhabitants \u2013 some of Persian, Arab and Indian origin who had intermarried. Its character changed.\" In an essay, \"Of Tamarinds and Cosmopolitans\", Farah wrote of a clash not of clans, but between pastoralist nomads and urbanites, in a once \"open city with no walls\". But he was moved by his welcome as one of Somalia's most famous sons (a celebrity matched only recently by the British Olympian Mo Farah): \"People touched me and said, Nuruddin is back, life is here. Others will come.\"</p> <p>Born in 1945 in Baidoa, in Italian Somaliland, Farah went to school in Ogaden (ceded by the British to Ethiopia) and Mogadishu. His father was an interpreter for the British governor, and his mother an oral poet. He used English textbooks, took Qur'anic lessons, and spoke Amharic, Arabic and Italian too. He claims an American typewriter had much to do with his choice of literary language. But his efforts to write in Somali, once it gained a written script in 1972, were curtailed by censorship. All his novels were later banned, and read only in smuggled copies.</p> <p>His first wife was a student from Bangalore whom he met while studying in Punjab (\"her father and I played chess\"), and their son is now an auditor in Detroit with two small daughters. Leaving Somalia in 1974 to do a master's degree in theatre at Essex University, Farah worked at London's Royal Court (\"making tea\"). When his second novel, <em>A Naked Needle</em> (1976), riled Somalia's despot, his brother advised him not to return. He was sentenced to death in absentia. \"The country died inside me, and I carried it, for a long time, like a woman with a dead baby,\" he says. \"It became the neurosis from which I write.\"</p> <p>After a trip that took in the Soviet Union, Greece under the colonels and Sadat's Egypt, he wrote his first trilogy, Variations on the Theme of an African Dictatorship (1979-83), consisting of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sweet-Variations-Theme-African-Dictatorship/dp/1555971598\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet and Sour Milk</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sardines-Variations-Theme-African-Dictatorship/dp/155597161X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347634030&amp;sr=8-2\" title=\"\"><em>Sardines</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Close-Sesame-Variations-African-Dictatorship/dp/1555971628\" title=\"\"><em>Close Sesame</em></a>. He once challenged fellow Somalis to \"study the structure of the Somali family and you will find mini-dictators imposing their will \u2026 We become replicas of the tyrant whom we hate. When you rid yourself of a monster, you become a monster.\" Somalia's implosion, which he predicted as early as 1988, fuelled a personal crisis. His mother died in 1990, when it was still unsafe to return. He got married for a second time, to a British-Nigerian academic, and moved to northern Nigeria, then South Africa.</p> <p>In his talk in Norway, he described being in a \"very difficult marriage, much worse and more debilitating than Nora's, even though I stayed in it ... maybe because I was in mourning\". As he sees it now, the collapse of Somalia \"necessitated the creation of a foundation. I was afloat, and needed an anchor. Marrying became an anchor \u2013 which was probably wrong.\" When the couple eventually split, and his children were taken to California, \"it reminded me of when I couldn't see my [elder] son.\" At that time, \"I couldn't go back; I was being hunted down. Two attempts at killing me were made, in Nigeria and Rome.\"</p> <p>As his second marriage foundered, \"writing became hard; living a lot harder.\" It took a dozen years to complete his second trilogy, <a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/blood_in_the_sun.html\" title=\"\"><em>Blood in the Sun</em></a> (1986-98), begun with <em>Maps</em>, set during the 1970s Ogaden war, and <em>Gifts</em>, at a time of famine. <em>Secrets</em> unfolds on the eve of civil war, and he deems it a pessimistic book. \"I was pretending to be happy, but wasn't. It's a novel that predicts terrible days.\" As a nation ruptures along bloodlines, the novel evoked incest and bestiality, \"to make everyone sit up and see the ugliness of what was happening. The entire country was a death camp\".</p> <p>Farah met his father for the first time in 17 years in a hospital in Mombasa, Kenya, and was told: \"We fled because we met the beasts in us, face to face.\" Farah's son and younger sister also fled by boat. In the non-fiction <em>Yesterday, Tomorrow</em> (2000), based on conversations with Somali refugees, Farah extrapolates from his own exile the anguish of people without means, education or a writer's creativity, when their country ceases to exist. The voices are \"raw, tearful, pained\". The book was spurred by \"two types of Somali: the poor in refugee camps in Kenya; and the rich, corrupt sons and daughters of the dictator and his cronies, staying at the Hilton in Nairobi&#xa0;and flying in private jets. I was interested in where the future of Somalia lay.\"</p> <p>He has been back often since 1996, and played peace- broker between armed groups in an effort curtailed by the Ethiopian invasion of 2006. Somalia, he says, is \"full of stories. We say, 'one sick person; a hundred doctors'. Somalia is a sick country and&#xa0;everyone has an opinion. Mine is&#xa0;one version; in a civil war, there are&#xa0;millions.\" In <em>Links</em> he wanted to offer an alternative angle on the US intervention of 1993 to the film <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. The trilogy was conceived, he says, in the context of \"misunderstandings, misconceptions and missing the point\", chief among those being that the conflict is clan warfare. Farah does not see himself as belonging to a clan. \"Anyone who claims to represent a clan is a dastardly liar. You can represent people who elected you. I can't represent my own brother.\"</p> <p><em>Crossbones</em> also casts doubt on reports of boom towns rich on piracy. Farah visited Puntland, and says: \"I did not see that wealth.\" The novel suggests those up the food chain, and abroad, take their cut. \"Nobody wants to talk about illegal fishing or the destruction of the environment \u2013 the marine life and coral reefs. What we talk about is the consequences of this destruction. There's enough UN information about nuclear and chemical waste dumped on the shores of Somalia \u2013 the tsunami unearthed it. Entire communities in Puntland have children born with deformities.\"</p> <p><em>Crossbones</em> takes place against the rise of al-Shabaab, the military wing of the Union of Islamic Courts, which has claimed allegiance to al-Qaida. Farah, who is a professor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, says susceptible teenagers were \"told they were fighting an enemy: infidels, unbelievers, Ethiopians, the federal government.\" The militant leaders are hypocrites, he adds, who \"leave their own sons and daughters in school, and recruit other people's.\" Taxliil in the novel, a troubled teenager briefly inducted by the militants, has no exit but via Guant\u00e1namo. Farah is indignant that \"he is going to prison. He's been misled by people who don't go to prison, but their names are known.\"</p> <p>Al-Shabaab's withdrawal from Mogadishu in August last year heralded&#xa0;the city's rebirth, with the return of many expatriates. Rather than having been routed by peacekeepers, Farah says, \"Shabaab's beastly attitudes alienated people, with stories of women raped and pregnant, whipped, killed. People were afraid; now no longer. More understand that Shabaab has nothing to do with religion; it's interested in political power.\" He was once attacked online for insisting the \"Afghan-type body tent is not culturally Somali. I said: 'My mother never wore a veil, nor my sisters.' They said my mother was not a Muslim.\" In the diaspora, he argues, \"the majority could not articulate their Somali culture. The less you know about Islam, the more conservative people become.\"</p> <p>When the National Theatre in Mogadishu was devastated by a suicide bomb last April, only two weeks after reopening, Farah's response was to write a short play in Somali, though its staging may take time. Three more of his recent plays are being translated into Somali. As Jean Anouilh set Sophocles in Nazi-occupied Paris, Farah's <em>Antigone in Somalia</em> is set during the Ethiopian occupation of Mogadishu of 2006-09. Antigone's brother, whose corpse cannot be buried, is a suicide bomber. In areas al-Shabaab controls, says Farah, they have \"forbidden song and dance because they're closer to Wahhabism than most Somalis\". Theatre that is verse-based, and sung to music, \"challenges everything such groups represent. They say it's evil, Satan's work, and that a woman's place is not on the stage.\" Yet visiting Mogadishu in the spring, he found people \"playing&#xa0;music and singing in tea houses and at parties. Women have created their own space.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/16/somalia-president-power-assassination-attempt\" title=\"\">Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud</a>, elected by MPs, took power last week, four days after surviving a suicide bombing for which al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Though Farah has reservations about \"electing MPs and president on a clan-based formula\", he believes there is no present alternative, given years of war. The president, whom he has met, \"struck me as trustworthy, a man capable of uniting the country and taking it forward, away from attrition and in-fighting.\"</p> <p>Though his protagonists strive to leave their homeland better than they found it, good intentions go awry. Farah notes a pessimistic turn in his fiction, \"and the reason is, Somalia is no longer what it was. No matter how the characters struggle, how can you reconstruct a country that's self-destructing continuously?\" Then, under a blazing Arctic summer sun that refuses to set over the harbour, he rallies: \"I'd like the dust to settle first. It will take five more years of peace. Then good things will come.\"</p>",
  "<p>To the US government, the People's Mojahedin Organisation of Iran (MEK) was a terrorist group alongside al-Qaida, Hamas and the Farc in Colombia. The MEK landed on the list in 1997 with American blood on its hands and by allying itself with Saddam Hussein along <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/qanda-mek-us-terrorist-organisation\">with a long list of bombings inside Iran</a>.</p> <p>But the organisation is regarded very differently by a large number of members of Congress, former White House officials and army generals, and even one of the US's most renowned reporters, Carl Bernstein. They see the MEK as a victim of US double dealings with the regime in Tehran and a legitimate alternative to the Iran's Islamic government.</p> <p>That difference is in no small part the result of a formidable fundraising operation and campaign to transform the MEK's image led by more than 20 Iranian American organisations across the US. These groups and their leaders have spent millions of dollars on donations to members of Congress, paying Washington lobby groups and hiring influential politicians and officials, including two former CIA directors, as speakers.</p> <p>In a highly sensitive political game, MEK supporters have succeeded in pressing the state department into removing the group from the list of terrorist organisations after winning a court order requiring a decision to be made on the issue before the end of this month. But its supporters were forced to tread a careful path so as not to cross anti-terrorism laws.</p> <p>Only a few years ago, the US authorities were arresting pro-MEK activists and freezing the assets of front groups for \"material support for a terrorist organisation\". Now members of Congress openly praise the group in apparent contradiction of the anti-terrorism legislation many of them supported. Nearly 100 members of the House of Representatives backed a resolution calling on the US government to drop the MEK from the terrorist list.</p> <p>At the forefront of the campaign are several Iranian American organisations across the US. They are:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The Iranian American Society of Texas</strong>. It paid more than $110,000 in fees last year to a Washington lobby firm, DiGenova &amp; Toensing, to campaign for the lifting of the ban on the MEK and the protection of its supporters still in camps in Iraq.</p> <p>The Texas group's president, Ali Soudjani, has personally donated close to $100,000 to members of Congress and their political campaigns over the past five years because, he told the Guardian, of their positions on the MEK and Iran. Among the beneficiaries were Ted Poe, a member of the House foreign affairs committee, and Sheila Jackson Lee, who have been vocal supporters of delisting the MEK. The pair appeared at a House event at Congress earlier this year also attended by Soudjani at which Poe gave support to the MEK in calling for \"freedom-loving Americans [to] support a regime change in Iran\". Jackson Lee described the group as the \"voices of freedom\". Soudjani also gave to John Boehner, speaker of the House of Representatives as well as the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Obama Victory Fund.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Colorado's Iranian American Community</strong>. One of its leaders, Saeid Ghaemi, paid close to $900,000 of his own money to a Washington lobby firm, DLA Piper, for its work to get the MEK unbanned, the protection of its members in Iraq and human rights issues. Ghaemi's brother, Mehdi, who is president of the Colorado group, paid $14,000 to fly a member of Congress, Bob Filner, to meet MEK leaders in Paris and attend the group's rallies. In the weeks before Filner spoke at an event in support of delisting the MEK last year he was the recipient of several thousand dollars in donations from Iranian Americans living outside his district.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The Iranian American Community of Northern California</strong>. It paid $400,000 over the past year to a Washington lobby group, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, to work on Capitol Hill to work for the removal of the MEK from the list of foreign terrorist organisations. The company assigned several former members of Congress to the account. The IACNC has also organised events in support of unbanning the MEK with appearances by Ros-Lehtinen and other prominent members of Congress as well as former White House officials.</p> <p>Its director, Ahmad Moeinimanesh, has made personal financial donations to Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the chair of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee even though her congressional district is on the other side of the country in Florida, as well as to her reelection committee. She has accepted more than $20,000 in political contributions from activists who support the MEK's delisting.</p> <p>The IACNC's registered address is at a photocopying shop in Albany, California, owned by Behnam Mirabdal who has made financial donations to Ros-Lehtinen and Dana Rohrabacher, a subcommittee chairman who is among the most vigorous proponents of unbanning the MEK.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The Iranian Society of South Florida (ISSF)</strong>. The group came to the notice of US authorities eight years ago as one of the sponsors of a fundraiser in Washington ostensibly to help victims of the Bam earthquake which killed 30,000 people. The FBI concluded it was a front for raising funds for the MEK.</p> <p>The ISSF's president and vice-president, Bahman Badiee and Akbar Nikooie, have for years made regular donations to Ros-Lehtinen. The Florida congresswoman <a href=\"http://ros-lehtinen.house.gov/about-me/awards\">boasts on her website</a> of receiving an award from the ISSF.</p> <p>Nikooie also spent at least $130,000 in 2009 to pay a lobby firm, DLA Piper, to promote \"human rights\" in Iran, including pressing for the unbanning of the MEK in the US. Badiee contributed $3,200 to Ros-Lehtinen. He gave $2,000 to congressman Mario Diaz-Balart in March the day after he made a speech in Congress in support of the MEK.</p> <p>The principal lobbyist on the account was the former leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, Dick Armey, who a decade ago wielded considerable power and played a major role in the Republican takeover of Congress. He went on to head the Tea Party-supporting group, Freedom Works.</p> <p>Armey used his relationship with sitting members of Congress five years ago to press them to urge the then secretary of state Condoleezza Rice to unban the MEK and to support legislation that would effectively have resulted in US sponsorship of the group. He also lobbied the Pentagon, the White House and the state department in support of unbanning the MEK.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The <a href=\"http://californiasdi.org\">California Society for Democracy in Iran</a></strong>. Its founder and president is Nasser Sharif who has called for the US government to \"<a href=\"http://www.californiasdi.org/history-of-csdi/\">engage the Iranian people and their organized resistance</a>\". Sharif is listed as donating thousands of dollars to Rohrabacher and Filner.</p> <p>Sharif <a href=\"http://www.ocregister.com/articles/mek-315002-iranian-designation.html\">called the MEK's banning an \"injustice\"</a> in an article in the Orange Country Register in which he quotes Rohrabacher in support of his cause. He has organised events at which the speakers include Ros-Lehtinen, Rohrabacher, Filner and Poe.</p> <p>Several of the groups also poured money into persuading leading politicians and former administration officials to speak on behalf of unbanning the MEK. Among those who have addressed meetings arranged by the Iranian American Community of Northern California are the former Democratic presidential candidate, Howard Dean; the former FBI director, Louis Freeh; the ex-attorney general, Michael Mukasey; and Tom Ridge, the former homeland security secretary. They have been joined by members of Congress including Ros-Lehtinen, Poe and Jackson Lee.</p> <p>Sharif's California Society for Democracy in Iran has organised meetings at which John Bolton, the former US ambassador to the UN; Andrew Card, President George W Bush's chief of staff; Mukasey, Ros-Lehtinen, Rohrabacher and other members of Congress have spoken. Several prominent former officials have acknowledged being paid significant amounts of money to speak about the MEK. The former Pennsylvania governor, Ed Rendell, has accepted more than $150,000 in speaking fees at events in support of unbanning the MEK.</p> <p>Among others who have spoken in support of delisting the group are two former CIA directors, James Woolsey and Porter Goss. Some speakers have been flown to Paris and Brussels.</p> <p>The US authorities have at times scrutinised efforts in support of unbanning the group, including launching investigations in to whether they breached laws against financial dealings with banned organisations or legislation barring material support for terrorism.</p> <p>Three years ago, seven people in California pleaded guilty to \"providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organisation\", and a parallel conspiracy charge, after fundraising for the MEK. Among other things the seven admitted to raising several hundred thousand dollars in collections at Los Angeles airport and other public locations in the name of a charity, the Committee for Human Rights.</p> <p>Following an investigation by the FBI's joint terrorism task force and the convictions, the US attorney's office said \"the CHR was simply a front organisation for MEK fund-raising operations in the United States\" and that the money was going in part to support the group's \"terrorist activities\".</p> <p>\"We cannot allow any terrorist organisation to fundraise on our shores or to steal money from our own citizens so that they can finance their own terrorism operations,\" said the prosecuting US attorney, Thomas O'Brien.</p> <p>In 2004 Bush administration officials examined whether a fundraising event at a Washington DC convention centre, ostensibly on behalf of victims of the Bam earthquake, was in fact a cover for collecting money for the MEK. The organisers, the Iranian-American Community of Northern Virginia, described the $35 a head event as a \"night of solidarity with Iran\" and a \"referendum for regime change in Iran\".</p> <p>Among those paid to speak at the event was Richard Perle, at the time a defence adviser to the Bush administration and a strong advocate of invading Iraq. Perle later said he was unaware of any connection to the MEK.</p> <p>The organisers claimed the money was going to the Red Cross but even before the event was held the Red Cross said it did not want the proceeds because the fundraiser was political. The FBI concluded that the Iranian-American Community of Northern Virginia was a front for the MEK and the treasury department froze the funds raised by the event.</p> <p>Those groups cosponsoring the fundraiser included several that the FBI described as MEK front organisations or as linked to prominent supporters. These included Iranian Society of South Florida, the Iranian-American Society of Texas and Colorado's Iranian-American Community.</p> <p>The Iranian-American Society of Northern Virginia is now defunct.</p> <p>Soudjani pointedly said that the money was not intended to support the MEK but it's unbanning \"in the name of freedom and justice\".</p> <p>\"The MEK is supporting a free Iran. That is what we are supporting,\" he said.</p> <p>Sharif makes a similar argument.</p> <p>\"None of us are involved in illegal activities. All we're doing is bringing the issue to the attention of members of Congress,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked if his donation to Filner, who has a district about 2,500 miles from where Sharif lives, was because of his position on Iran and the MEK, Sharif said that it was.</p> <p>\"Yes. If you see members of Congress with a good position on Iran, you can support them. This is a voluntary thing. Members of the community do this. If they feel like members of Congress have a good position in supporting these issues they are willing to support those members of Congress\".</p> <p>Moeinimanesh and several other leaders of Iranian American organisations did not respond to questions. Neither did Ros-Lehtinen and other members of Congress did not respond to questions. But Rohrabacher did speak to the Guardian.</p> <p>The California congressman said he is comfortable accepting donations from MEK supporters.</p> <p>\"If they want to contribute to me because I believe strongly in human rights and stand up in cases like this, that's fine. I don't check their credentials,\" he said.</p> <p>Rohrabacher said he is not concerned at potentially being at odds with the law.</p> <p>\"When you have a person or an organisation that has been legally labelled something that is not just then you should take that label off. It doesn't undermine efforts to label terrorists when they are indeed committing acts of terrorism,\" he said.</p> <p>The congressman also denounced the treasury investigation of payments to speakers in support of the MEK.</p> <p>\"It seems to be me this is an example where somebody's challenging a government policy and the government is trying to intimidate those who don't believe in the policy into closing their mouths. Because someone is advocating a certain position, and it goes against government policy, it doesn't mean the government should start focussing on them and try to find something they can hurt them with. That's a damper on freedom of speech,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has visited Manchester to pay his respects to the two police officers shot dead this week.</p> <p>During a visit to Greater Manchester police headquarters the prime minister said: \"I think the whole country is profoundly shocked by what has happened and it is right we praise the work that they did and remember all they have done.</p> <p>\"I think it is also important that the government makes sure that it is doing everything it can to help the Greater Manchester police force tackle organised crime and gang-related violence, and I think that is an important conversation and important work to be done too.\"</p> <p>On Friday morning the man accused of murdering the officers as well as a father and son <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/21/dale-cregan-court-police-murder\" title=\"\">made a two-minute court appearance in Manchester</a> amid tight security.</p> <p>, Police said a 15-year-old boy had been arrested at a school over the murders of the two policewomen. The teenager was held on suspicion of assisting an offender and questioned by police investigating the deaths of Pc Nicola Hughes, 23, and Pc Fiona Bone, 32, and father and son David and Mark Short. He was later released on bail until 27 September pending further inquiries.</p> <p>Earlier, armed officers were in the city's magistrates court as Dale Cregan, 29, of no fixed address, appeared in the dock in a dark blue sweatshirt and tracksuit bottoms, with a full beard and wearing a black onyx false eye to replace his missing left eye. He was led into the dock of the packed courtroom flanked by four police officers, while two more officers dressed in military-style fatigues and armed with machine guns stood outside the dock and two armed officers sat in the public gallery. Armed officers could be seen in offices overlooking the court building.</p> <p>Cregan appeared before district judge Jonathan Taaffe charged with the murder of constables Bone and Hughes on Tuesday at the Hattersley estate in Mottram, Tameside.</p> <p>The officers were killed in a shooting and grenade attack as they responded to a routine burglary report. Cregan is also charged with the murders of David and Mark Short, and attempted murder of four other people either injured or present during the separate attacks on the father and son.</p> <p>Cregan sat down briefly after he was led into the dock but stood up when asked to do so by Taaffe. The defendant spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth to the packed courtroom.</p> <p>Mark Short, 23, died from a gunshot wound to his neck after a gunman entered a pub and opened fire at around 11.50pm at the Cotton Tree Inn in Droylsden, Tameside, on 25 May. Cregan is also accused of the attempted murders of Michael Belcher, Ryan Pridding and John Short, who were in the pub at the time.</p> <p>On 10 August the victim's father, David, 46, died in a grenade and gun attack on his home in Clayton, Manchester. Less than 10 minutes later there was another grenade explosion less than half a mile away in Droylsden. Cregan faces a further charge of attempted murder of Sharon Hark arising from the incidents on that day.</p>",

  "<p>Only seconds after we left the hotel, the attacks began. The first hit got me right in the face, a direct shot from a passing car \u2013 a drive-by. A second came from a gang of youths hiding in an alleyway. Then the bombs came thick and fast. As we edged towards the centre of town, they pelted us from hidden corners, and bombarded us from unnoticed balconies. Within an hour we were drenched.</p> <p>Sequins, beads and feather headdresses have their place but, in Bolivia, carnival time is celebrated first with water fights. From late January and throughout February, Bolivians young and old take to the streets for spontaneous water fights, using water balloons, spray cans of foam, and semi-automatic-sized water pistols.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry,\" Javier, our contact in La Paz, had warned my friend Anna and me before we set off to Sucre, Bolivia's attractive judicial capital, \"but as tourists you will be targeted even more!\" He wasn't wrong. While exploring the colourful buildings, craft markets and cool little bars of small, neat Sucre \u2013 very different from vast, rambling La Paz \u2013 we wore cagoules with the hoods pulled tight, and wrapped our cameras in carrier bags.</p> <p>Being drawn into a giant nationwide water fight wasn't the only festive fun. Though our month in Bolivia began a week before the big carnival parades, the country was already in party mode. Balloons, flags, flower garlands and streamers decorated every building; bands were playing their way around town on foot; and at weekends it was hard to spot a child not in fancy dress.</p> <p>One morning we were buying textiles in one of Sucre's craft stores when we heard a brass band outside. Poking our heads out, we were swept along by a dancer who took us by the arms and twirled us along for several blocks.</p> <p>Days later, we arrived at midnight in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2012/may/11/bolivia-hotels-uyuni-desert-mountains\" title=\"\">Uyuni</a>, the desolate outpost town near the country's incredible salt flats, in a terrible storm after a grim 10-hour bus journey from Potos\u00ed. We were amazed to hear the strains of folk music floating out of the darkness from a little brass band playing their hearts out in the rain in the deserted street.</p> <p>While these small celebrations add a joyful dimension to South American travel at this time of year, we would have been mad to miss one of the continent's biggest carnival parades, El Carnaval de Oruro, a week-long Rio-style procession of dozens of dancing troupes from all over Bolivia who gather in an isolated mining town on the southern Altiplano. Performing in fantastic costumes and huge masks, they continue for several sleepless days and nights, fuelled by strong spirits and <em>chicha, </em>a thick bubbly slop made from fermented corn.</p> <p>The celebration is shown continually on Bolivian TV and becomes the focus of the nation's attention while it's on. Traditional dance groups and Oruro's own Diablada (\"devil\" dancers in special costumes) rehearse all year and spend hundreds of dollars on each costume, forming a parade thousands strong, with thousands more spectators travelling to attend.</p> <p>It is a complex mix of Christian and indigenous tales and rituals, an expression of good over evil, of native groups over the Spanish. The dominant explanation says it commemorates the Virgin of Candelaria who, legend has it, helped an injured thief reach his home in Oruro to die and left her image in a cave where she has been worshipped by the mining community ever since.</p> <p>I had imagined a quaint folk-dancing show, but then I exchanged emails with travel blogger Jamie Lafferty, who sent me a link to <a href=\"http://idoneaholiday.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/party-time-or-how-i-decided-to-stop.html\" title=\"\">his report</a> of the previous year's event. This rather literally pissed on our parade: he described being beaten up and robbed at knife-point, waking up in hospital, and wild drunks peeing in the streets (and on his girlfriend). We bought waterproofs and went anyway.</p> <p>The rest of the year, Oruro is just a poor unvisited mining town, with few recommendable sights, redeeming features, or hotels. The lack of infrastructure means it is not the easiest festival to attend, and those who turn up without a hotel room booked months in advance might be lucky to share a room in a private home with dozens of others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396478636\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/20/1348148586121/Carnival-in-Sajama-001.jpg\" alt=\"Carnival in Sajama\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carnival time in Sajama, Bolivia.

So we stayed on until La Paz and arranged for a driver to take us back to Oruro the next day.</p> <p>Even in the morning the atmosphere was frenetic. We had to push through crowds covered in foam to get to the parade, then wait ages for a space to become free on one of the rough tiered benches set up for spectators. As we took our seats, the Bolivians seated around us shouted \"no! no!\" and tried to shoo us away, worried we would attract water attacks. But several hours later we were sharing beers, crackers and coca leaves with them, singing and cheering the energetic procession. Dancers in glittering thigh-high boots, ra-ra skirts and feathered bowler hats strutted by, dashing drummers leapt and jangled their ankle bells, and suited band members, too drunk to keep their eyes open or play their instruments, wobbled along hilariously, all creating a spectacle.</p> <p>After seeing another similarly noisy, sparkly big-city parade in La Paz, we felt we'd like to see how people celebrated in their normal lives, too.</p> <p>Throughout the carnival period, but particularly on Shrove Tuesday, Bolivian families gather to perform <em>cha'lla</em>, a ceremony of thanks to Pachamama, the earth mother. Blood and alcohol are sprinkled at the corners of their homes, villages and sacred sites, sayings are repeated, streamers hung and fire-crackers let off.</p> <p>Cha'lla is part of life whether you're Aymara, Quechua, or mestizo, and most folk are Catholic, too. In La Paz, I saw cha'llas on battered old cars, fast-food joints and dirty street corners, and Javier told us one day he was off to bless his office, including the computer (presumably without the llama blood).</p> <p>To witness more traditional cha'lla ceremonies away from the cities, we drove south-west across the Altiplano, to a village called Curahuara de Carangas. In the sunny square they were blessing trees festooned with balloons, and preparing for a feast to be thrown by the mayor.</p> <p>\"I'm so sorry,\" he said when we met, \"you have just missed the sacrifice of the llamas!\"</p> <p>How disappointing. Instead, we accepted an invitation to a village council meeting. He and his wife, dressed in their finest red and green ponchos and woven shawls, sat at the head of a table upon which lay a big bowl of coca leaves and the heads of 30 llamas, gifts from local families. We chewed our leaves politely while the council decided a suitable punishment for a man who'd got drunk at the party and hit his wife (a certain number of bricks would have to be made for the village, they agreed).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396478635\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348221448671/Houses-in-sleepy-Sajama-a-001.jpg\" alt=\"Houses in sleepy Sajama, at the foot of Bolivia's highest mountain\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Houses in sleepy Sajama, at the foot of Bolivia's highest mountain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next we reached Sajama, Bolivia's oldest national park, near the Chilean border, where Bolivia's highest mountain, Nevado Sajama (6,542m), rises up as a perfect snowy cone. Sajama village was so sleepy we thought we'd missed everything, and we were the only guests at the Albergue Ecoturistico Tomarapi just outside, jointly owned by 36 families.</p> <p>But the area is also a spectacular place for hiking. To go high-altitude trekking in Sajama, we only needed to step out of our door: the village is at 4,200m. We roamed higher, over plains of green moss and quinoa fields, among herds of llama and alpaca. The world's highest forest \u2013 of underwhelming dwarf <em>que\u00f1ua</em> trees \u2013 grows here and there were bubbling multi-coloured geysers and hot springs where we swam down peaty channels.</p> <p>And then, one late afternoon, as the sky turned purple behind the snow-capped volcanos, the village suddenly came out. The boys mounted wild-looking ponies, women in frilly shiny skirts began to dance, and the men got out their <em>quena</em> flutes. They all formed a small but beautiful procession on the cold muddy streets and we followed them as they blessed each corner of their shabby little village for what had passed that year, and what might lie ahead.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The trip was provided by High Lives (</em><a href=\"http://www.highlives.co.uk/default.aspx?pageid=132\" title=\"\"><em>highlives.co.uk</em></a><em>).

  "<p>Ten years ago, the hills of Britain glowed with 500 beacons to signal a campaign for \"liberty and livelihood\" in the countryside. About<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/23/hunting.ruralaffairs2\" title=\"\"> 400,000 descended on London</a> in chartered trains and buses, hunting horns blaring and whistles shrieking in the biggest demonstration since the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_Tax_Riots\" title=\"\">poll tax disturbances of 1990</a>: the aristos from their country estates; the poorer workers at their gates; and the nouveau hunting and shooting set.</p> <p>\"Listen to us,\" they screamed outside Westminster. Parliament didn't. The Hunting Act, ostensibly banning hunting with dogs, received royal assent in 2004, with a majority of MPs ignoring claims 16,000 jobs would go as a direct result, and hundreds of hounds destroyed. As I reported for the Guardian at the time, quoting respected rural academics ruthlessly criticised by a newly formed Countryside Alliance, the claims were alarmist in the extreme.</p> <p>Few, if any, jobs have been lost. The hunters keep hunting, albeit their hounds sometimes following trails of either aniseed or a concoction replicating fox scent. Foxes are still destroyed legally by shooting and illegally or otherwise by hounds that can't be diverted from following their traditional quarry. And who can prove \u2013 here's the crux of the act \u2013 whether an animal was \"intentionally\" killed or not? It's a legal minefield.</p> <p>But there's a broader issue rarely challenged: is hunting really a vital ingredient of rural England, binding communities together? Professor Michael Winter, a member of the government's 1999 Burns inquiry, which examined the consequences of a hunting ban, recalls: \"One of the things it showed was just how marginal hunting is to life in the countryside \u2026 most people are not involved.\"</p> <p>Consequently, 10 years ago, the alliance skilfully placed hunting alongside wider concerns in the countryside to appeal to a much broader constituency. Today, 300 odd hunts in England and Wales (10 in Scotland) carry on regardless, give or take the odd saboteur, seemingly oblivious to a deepening countryside crisis for those on low and average incomes, and others aspiring to get on the farming ladder.</p> <p>House prices are rocketing. The agency Hometrack reports that in second home \"hot spots\" they've doubled in 10 years, with a staggering 108% rise in north Devon. Bus services are being decimated, with almost a third chopped from a once ringfenced rural bus grant by the coalition. Agricultural land prices are going through the roof as speculators exploit inheritance tax, capital gains loopholes and lucrative farming subsidies.</p> <p>Behind the veneer of rolling pastures and timeless villages of honeyed Cotswold limestone, and shimmering Cumbrian green slate or harsher Cornish granite, the people who service the rural economy \u2013 farm workers, hotel staff, teachers, health visitors, the self-employed \u2013 often can't afford to live in their own countryside. Many are forced into cheaper accommodation in towns and cities, \"reverse commuting\".</p> <p>Moreover, enforced council house sales have removed a social housing pool for workers who can never afford a mortgage. Latest figures show an alarming fall in annual '\"affordable\" rural housing completions in England to only 3,184 in 2011-12 \u2013 \"affordable\" now means paying rents at 80% of full-market rates \u2013 with social housing being consigned to history. Government plans to remove an obligation for new developments to include an element of affordable housing will make it even harder for many to find a home in a rural England increasingly the preserve of a new, moneyed class.</p> <p>Above it all, the old aristocracy is more secure than ever in a country with the most concentrated private land ownership in Europe, according to Philip Lowe, professor of rural economy at Newcastle University. He says this concentration in the hands of old money \u2013 Dukes of Buccleuch, Westminster, Northumberland, for instance \u2013 sets England (and much of Scotland) apart from the rest of the world. But with newish land reform legislation, Scotland at least is moving towards democratic ownership, with community-run trusts now owning at least half a million acres in the Highlands and islands.</p> <p>This week the Prince of Wales, ultimate manifestation of that ownership concentration, whose Duchy of Cornwall owns at least 141,000 acres, hosted a seminar at his Highgrove home in Gloucestershire. The aim was to get more young people into farming and boost domestic food production. That is a formidable task, with <a href=\"http://www.alternativeoutlook.co.uk/2012/09/booming-demand-for-farmland-pushes-prices-higher/\" title=\"\">agricultural land prices trebling</a> in 10 years to an average of \u00a36,628 per acre according to the latest figures \u2013 making outright ownership a distant dream for many.</p> <p>While around 70% of agricultural land in England is owner-occupied and 30% tenanted, the <a href=\"http://www.tfa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Tenant Farmers Association</a> cautions the figures are misleading because at least three-quarters of farmers are dependent on renting some land. The big owners often hold sway.</p> <p>Ominously, the one option that offered a way into agriculture for aspiring farmers \u2013 county council-owned farms \u2013 is slowly contracting as local authorities sell valuable assets to make ends meet. Although still covering 228,000 acres across England, with 2,700 tenants, at least 100,000 acres have been sold since the mid-1980s. The number of tenants has fallen by a third.</p> <p>There is a sensible way forward. With no prospect of England following Scotland by embracing land reform, surely it's time for a serious debate \u2013 possibly a commission of inquiry \u2013 into the ownership and management of English land. As a modest first step, Philip Lowe sensibly advocates a charter between landowners and the government setting out rights and responsibilities. Will either this government, or the hunting lobby \u2013 self-styled guardians of the countryside \u2013 take up the challenge? Not a chance. Tally-ho!</p>",

  "<p>As someone who has spent much of his working life bridging the gap between Germany and the UK, I would like to thank you for your insightful and entertaining series on Germany (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/germany-the-accidental-empire\" title=\"\">The accidental empire</a>). Few Britons probably realise they share a love of allotments with the Germans. And your portrait of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/angela-merkel-austerity-swabian-housewives?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">thrifty Swabian housewife</a>, with a tradition of abhorring waste, also gave clues as to why the green movement gained far greater traction than in the UK.</p> <p>However, in describing how Germans save a one-third deposit before buying a house, it is important to understand that this is enforced by law, since the Pfandbriefgesetz, which regulates the issue of mortgage-backed bonds by banks, restricts the maximum loan-to-value on eligible collateral to 65%. Such a statutory cap remains political taboo in the UK (though ironically the British authorities never hesitated to use it in Hong Kong), but, alongside rent regulation, has been the key to a stable, affordable housing market in Germany.</p> <p>Larry Elliott fairly observed (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/angela-merkel-shape-europe-german-image\" title=\"\">Why one country carries so much clout</a>, 18 September) that German banks were not immune from the \"reckless investment decisions\" of US or UK banks abroad, but is completely wrong in his conspiracy view of German banks pumping up \"housing bubbles in Spain and Greece\". Nord LB's own exposure amounts to 5% of all credit extended globally \u2013 and the bailout of Bankia in Spain points to the inconvenient truth that their property bubble is overwhelmingly home-grown.</p> <p>Ill-advised purchases of portfolios of US mortgage-backed securities by several banks including West LB (which are now being wound up) triggered the German banking crisis of 2007-08, not exposure to Europe's peripheral economies.<br><strong>Tom Brown</strong><br><em>Senior credit executive, Norddeutsche Landesbank, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 David Blunkett is wrong to criticise Germany as \"imperialist\" for its refusal to consider a renegotiation of debt bailouts, which the Greeks voted for in their general election (Report, 17 September). A key theme of the eurozone crisis has been the clamour of countries in fiscal difficulties for Germany to shoulder more of the financial burden with higher debt guarantees. Leaving aside the question of whether Germany even has the capacity to do this, it is politically inconceivable that Chancellor Merkel, who is answerable to German voters, could simply accede to such a demand solely because Greek voters desire it.</p> <p>This criticism rings particularly hollow given that the UK itself has steadfastly refused throughout the crisis to step in and commit to either the EFSF or the ESM rescue funds.<br><strong>Professor Simon Green</strong><br><em>Co-director, Aston University Centre for Europe</em></p>",
  "<p>Next week Professor David Nutt will test the effects of MDMA \u2013 otherwise known as ecstasy \u2013 on a number of volunteers live on TV in a research project funded by&#xa0;Channel&#xa0;4. Julia Manning, chief executive of thinktank 2020Health believes the experiment is reckless. Oliver Laughland chairs.</p> <p><strong>David Nutt:</strong> The project has two purposes. The first is to show the whole process \u2013 from design to analysis \u2013 of a scientific experiment being performed. The second is to do the first UK imaging study of the human brain with [the effects of] MDMA, using the latest technology. The drug has been around for 50 years, and been used massively by young people. It also has important therapeutic potential and it's necessary, from the perspective of a neuroscientist, to understand what it does in the brain.</p> <p><strong>Julia Manning:</strong> It's reckless and pointless. We have a high regard for British scientific research. But I was alarmed when I heard about this. I don't believe it is a serious scientific study. It's been funded by Channel 4 because the Medical Research Council (MRC) and other authoritative bodies wouldn't fund it.</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> The research quality in this study is world-leading, using cutting-edge neuro-imaging technology and analysis. It will be published in the highest-quality journals. It's being funded by a television company not because other funders don't value the qualities of the research. When we put this study as part of a larger project to the MRC, it was scored very highly, but didn't fit in with the MRC's portfolio of addiction. As we know, MDMA is not addictive. I should be commended for finding a way of doing quality science, which otherwise wouldn't happen.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> Simply because you're using high technology doesn't make it quality. I also dispute that MDMA isn't addictive, because it's an amphetamine and it's well-known that amphetamines are addictive. Ecstasy and other drugs are illegal for good reasons. Not just for scientific reasons \u2013 it's because of the social, economic and moral messages that it&#xa0;sends out as well.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Laughland:</strong> Do you think the programme will send out the wrong moral message?</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> I don't think a scientific programme has any relationship to moral messages. What we're trying to do is understand the effects on the brain of a drug which, as everyone who uses it \u2013 by and large \u2013 tells us, produces an interesting and profound change in people's feelings in a positive direction. This science will give us an insight into a brain mechanism underpinning trust, empathy and love, and may lead us to new therapies. I am president of the British Neuroscience Association; I know what good neuroscience is, and this is cutting-edge.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> It's publicity-seeking neuroscience. It's publicity-seeking neuroscience. The issue is that you're using an illegal drug to get publicity for your research and position, which is wanting to legalise access to [some] drugs. If&#xa0;you're really looking to do serious neuroscience, why aren't you looking for a cure for Alzheimer's or Parkinson's?</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> Sorry, Julia, but depression is still \u2013 as you may know from the recent report from the European Brain Council, of which I'm vice president \u2013 the largest cause of disability in Europe. We have many treatments that are not particularly effective. I'm looking to innovate. You should be endorsing this approach and encouraging the British pharmaceutical industry to support me. The reason it is not is because it is too terrified of the illegal status of these drugs \u2013 it believes, incorrectly, that working in this field would give it bad publicity. Your argument with me is essentially fuelling that prejudice.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> That's absolutely not the case. The University of Birmingham is using a derivative of MDMA [in a modified form to examine its effects on fighting blood cancer cells]. It has got a licence from the Home Office. Have you got one?</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> Of course we have. Are you saying that fighting cancer is more important than depression? That it's all right to use illegal drugs for cancer but you can't use them for depression or trauma illness? The illegality is a separate dimension. There are drugs that are very useful but also illegal; drugs such as opiates, ketamine, amphetamines \u2013 all of which are prescribable for medical conditions. My view is clear. If this drug has therapeutic utility, doctors should be able to use it.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> This sends the wrong message to the public and to young people because it implies that taking MDMA as it is currently constituted, could be valid for therapeutic use. The other examples that you cited have medically approved, trialled and tested forms in which the risks have been considered to be less than the benefits. That is the basis of all our medicine. There is no restriction on doing proper trials on drugs that are available as illegal forms. If you come up with a valid scientific study, the MRC and the Home Office will often give approval to looking into possible therapeutic uses for those drugs \u2013 often in different forms, not in their street form. The law is in place to protect and that is important. What this programme will do is glamorise the taking of MDMA.</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> This is something we thought about very carefully. I'm not in favour of taking any [illegal] drugs, which is why I'm concerned about the glamorising of the taking of alcohol in many aspects of our society. I am anti-drugs, and my entire research career has been directed towards understanding the harms of drugs so we can minimise them. I'm not in the business of glamorising anything. You will see when you watch the show that it's extremely rigorous. It will tell us where MDMA works in the brain, whether there is a biological relationship between taking MDMA and the three-day blues [come down] \u2013 which I can tell you now there isn't. It will make the data even stronger on how this drug might be useful in post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p><strong>OL:</strong> Won't showing you taking this drug in a controlled environment go some way to demystifying its use? It's a fact of life for thousands of young people.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> I don't think drugs are a fact of life. Only three million adults have tried drugs. Use of drugs is symptomatic of profound malaise; we are letting down young people and children if we imply taking drugs is something that could have value. It's not the drugs that are in question, it's the human, psychological and existential issues complicit in drug-taker behaviour that we should be raising.</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> These people [taking part in the experiment] are taking a chemical that's 99.9% pure ecstasy. This is not street drugs, this is the pure form that could be used therapeutically. I was working with the Home Office when people began to get concerned about the harms of ecstasy in the 1990s. Now I realise this was due to a misunderstanding of how to use the drug, and gross exaggeration by the media. I realise now that the drug is far less harmful then I believed at the time. Putting it into class A was wrong, it was politically motivated. It's been vilified.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> We don't agree that you can look at a drug by itself. You have to consider the social, moral and economic implications of doing anything that suggests taking a banned substance is OK.</p> <p><em>Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial is on Channel 4 at 10pm on Wednesday and Thursday next week</em></p>",
  "<p>If I deliberately wound up an angry, resentful acquaintance to&#xa0;the point where he went on a&#xa0;rampage and murdered someone, I like to think I would have some regrets, that the important detail would not be the&#xa0;fact that it was my right to make the points I did, in the manner I&#xa0;did, but that I had caused someone to kill and someone to die.</p> <p>Similarly, I like to believe that if a teacher called to say my child was insisting on her right to criticise the physical, intellectual and social shortcomings of some of her classmates, and that it was causing those classmates distress, then I would have a word with my child about her behaviour.</p> <p>I would also like to think that were I&#xa0;the editor of a French satirical magazine, having just watched as swaths of people&#xa0;across a number of countries erupted into sometimes fatal anger over&#xa0;a film they believed had insulted them, I would not think: \"Cool. Let's see&#xa0;if we can stoke that nightmare right up again.\"</p> <p>However, an astonishing number of people seem to feel differently. The right to free speech is not in the least abused, it seems, when troublemaking hotheads decide their provocative opinions have more legitimacy than any other consideration within the complex matrix of human responsibility.</p> <p>The right to offend is precious. The right to taunt large numbers of already resentful people is the acme of freedom, civilisation and sophistication. Apparently.</p> <p>Many of the people who defend so ardently the right to offend would call the police immediately if a mob of angry&#xa0;people decided to stand on their&#xa0;doorstep and tell them they were selfish, little narcissists who ought to be ashamed of themselves. Why? Because \u2013 no offence \u2013 they were all of those things and hypocrites as well.</p> <p>But who really thinks the right to offend is inalienable? Who believes that&#xa0;some hideous error was made when&#xa0;it became untenable to put a sign on the door of your pub saying: \"No Irish, no blacks, no dogs\"? Is there anyone who thinks the world would be&#xa0;a&#xa0;better place if high levels of homophobia were lauded as a wonderful sign that the right to free speech was being enthusiastically upheld? And who&#xa0;would think it fair and sensible if&#xa0;the primacy of free speech dictated that there could be no such thing as slander or libel?</p> <p>Free speech does not confer the right&#xa0;to be wrong, mistaken, biased or&#xa0;merely a doggedly axe-grinding pain-in-the-ass about your pet hates. It&#xa0;is by no means a&#xa0;settled fact that there&#xa0;is no God, that Muhammad was not his final prophet and that the world would not be a better place if everyone submitted to his teachings. I am absolutely certain that it is bunkum, but&#xa0;I can't prove it. So until someone tries to make me live my life as if Islam were an indisputable fact, I am happy to&#xa0;let Muslims arrange their own lives under whatever legal set of narrative values they prefer. That, to me, is the most vital western value \u2013 not the absolute and untrammelled freedom to shoot my mouth off, whatever the ghastly consequences.</p> <p>Happily, the teachings of Islam don't contradict those truly fundamental values. Yes, a lot of hideous acts are perpetrated in the name of Islam, acts that most Muslims abhor. But a lot of hideous acts are perpetrated in the name of liberal democracy, too, without invalidating all aspects of liberalism or democracy. Neither belief system is perfect, and therefore, surely, neither can claim the perfect right to condemn and ridicule the other.</p> <p>Furthermore, many of the Islamic values the west finds so reprehensible were our own settled values too, until embarrassingly recently. Islamic homophobia? Not acceptable.</p> <p>Yet gay people in Britain only achieved the <a href=\"http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_home/hate_crime_domestic_violence_and_criminal_law/2643.asp\" title=\"\">same rights to legal sex as&#xa0;heterosexuals in 2001</a>. Islamic inequality in its treatment of men and women? Don't start me. Yet I remember a time when two women walking into a&#xa0;pub together was like two pheasants wandering on to a shooting range.</p> <p>Barbarous Islamic punishment? We hanged our last murderers in 1964. Some Islamist groups' yearnings for world domination? Britain parcelled out the land of another people like it was the family allotment, as recently as 1948.</p> <p>Of course, most extremist Islamists (not all Muslims) are hypocrites too. They reserve the right to condemn the secular values of&#xa0;the west, even as they threaten to kill&#xa0;those who condemn the religious values they cleave to themselves (or any&#xa0;more handy proxy who happens to&#xa0;be within reach). They demand unconditional respect for Islam, while reserving their own right to despise and revile the west.</p> <p>The worst irony? Despite the many differences between the Islamic world and the west, we have one vast arrogance in common: we won't content ourselves with living and letting live. We each want our values to be universally adopted. We each want to be proved right. We each want to win.</p> <p>The west won't win by antagonising those Muslims who can be relied on to&#xa0;rise to the western dog whistle. It scores a few petty propaganda points, that's all. And Islamists won't win by antagonising those westerners who rise to the Islamic dog whistle. Telling the west it can't criticise Islam, any more than Muslims can, is like a red rag to a&#xa0;bull.</p> <p>Mass Arab street protest thrills the west when we agree with it \u2013 as with the Arab spring \u2013 and appals if we don't \u2013 as&#xa0;when we see a heated anti-American uprising. Yet indiscriminate anti- Americanism is no more or less valid than indiscriminate Islamophobia. Maybe it is time for both western and Islamist hotheads to have a think about this, for example: \"Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.\" (Quran 13:11). Smart advice. Works for everyone.</p> <p>Islamists need to stop attacking the west, and issuing fatwas against those outside the Islamic belief system. Likewise, the west needs to solve its own problems, rather than insisting on interfering in the affairs of Muslims, while failing to admit that previous interference might have provoked much&#xa0;of the \"Muslim rage\" that westerners find so \"medieval\". In fact, the finger-wagging criticism from Islamaphobic zealots is just more of the \"We know what's best; you do what you're told\" attitude that has already caused such mayhem. It&#xa0;is time for both parties to get a grip.</p>",
  "<p>Supporters of a designated Iranian terrorist organisation have won a long struggle to see it unbanned in the US after pouring millions of dollars into an unprecedented campaign of political donations, hiring Washington lobby groups and payments to former top administration officials.</p> <p>A Guardian investigation, drawing partly on data researched by the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/\">Centre for Responsive Politics</a>, a group tracking the impact of money in US politics, has identified a steady flow of funds from key Iranian American organisations and their leaders into the campaign to have the People's Mojahedin Organisation of Iran removed from the list of terrorist organisations.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, is expected to notify Congress that the MEK will be removed from the terrorism list in the coming days. </p> <p>The campaign to bury the MEK's bloody history of bombings and assassinations that killed American businessmen, Iranian politicians and thousands of civilians, and to portray it as a loyal US ally against the Islamic government in Tehran has seen large sums of money directed at three principal targets: members of Congress, Washington lobby groups and influential former officials. </p> <p>Prominent among the members of Congress who have received fund is Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the chair of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee. She has accepted at least $20,000 in donations from Iranian American groups or their leaders to her political campaign fund. </p> <p>Other recipients include Congressman Bob Filner, who was twice flown to address pro-MEK events in France and has pushed resolutions resolutions in the House of Representatives calling for the group to be unbanned. More than $14,000 in expenses for Filner's Paris trips were met by the head of an Iranian American group who also paid close to $1m to a Washington lobby firm working to get the MEK unbanned. </p> <p>A Texas Congressman, Ted Poe, received thousands of dollars in donations from the head of a pro-MEK group in his state at a time when he was a regular speaker on behalf of its unbanning at events across the US, describing the organisation as the ticket to regime change in Iran. </p> <p>Mike Rogers, chairman of the House of Representatives intelligence committee, has also received the backing of individuals and groups that support the unbanning of the MEK. Rogers has been among the strongest supporters in Congress of delisting the group, sponsoring resolutions and pressing other members of Congress to support the cause. </p> <p>A leading advocate of unbanning the MEK and chairman of the foreign affairs committee's oversight subcommittee, congressman Dana Rohrabacher, has received thousands of dollars in donations from supporters of the banned group this year alone.</p> <p>The Guardian sought comment from Ros-Lehtinen, Rogers, Filner, Poe and Rohrabacher. Only Rohrabacher responded.</p> <p>He said he was comfortable accepting donations from MEK supporters but that the money has no influence on his position that it should be unbanned.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't doubt that people would donate to my campaign if it's something that they see as beneficial to them, to what they believe in, whether it's the MEK or whether it's anybody else,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The question is whether it's the right position to take or not and whether it's a benefit to the people of the United States as a whole. In this case I've no doubt that supporting the MEK under this brutal attack from the Mullah regime [in Tehran] is in the interests of what I believe in but also in the interests of the people of the United States.\"</p> <p>Rohrabacher said the MEK's past attacks on Americans, its bombing campaign in Iran that killed top politicians and civilians, and its support of Saddam Hussein were history and the group has turned its back on violence. He also denied that public support for a designated terrorist organisation might put him in conflict with the law.</p> <p>\"This isn't a bad group. A long time ago, in their history, they certainly had a questionable time \u2013 20, 30, 40 years ago. But I don't know of any evidence they've engaged in terrorism for many, many years,\" he said. \"They're not a terrorist group simply because some bureaucrats in the state department say so.\"</p> <p>Three top Washington lobby firms - DLA Piper; Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld; and DiGenova &amp; Toensing - have been paid a total of nearly $1.5 million over the past year to press the US administration and legislators to support the delisting of the MEK and protection for its members in camps in Iraq.</p> <p>Two other lobby groups were hired for much smaller amounts. The firms employed former members of Congress to press their ex-colleagues on Capitol Hill to back the unbanning of the MEK.</p> <p>Scores of former senior officials have been paid up to $40,000 to make speeches in support of the MEK's delisting. Those who have received money include the former chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Hugh Shelton; ex-FBI director Louis Freeh; and Michael Mukasey, who as attorney general oversaw the prosecution of terrorism cases.</p> <p>The former Pennsylvania governor, Ed Rendell, has accepted more than $150,000 in speaking fees at events in support of the MEK's unbanning. Clarence Page, a columnist for the Chicago Tribune, was paid $20,000 to speak at the rally. Part of the money has been paid through speakers bureaus on the US east coast.</p> <p>Others accepted only travel costs, although in some cases that involved expensive trips to Europe.</p> <p>In June, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the US House of Representatives and Republican presidential candidate, flew to Paris to address a pro-MEK rally and meet its co-leader, Maryam Rajavi. He was criticised for bowing to her.</p> <p>Congressman Rohrabacher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/22/iranian-terror-group-lobbies-capitol-hill\">has described the lobbying campaign as one of the most effective</a> he has seen on Capitol Hill. It has galvanised powerful support for delisting the MEK far beyond those receiving political contributions, lobbying fees or other payments.</p> <p>Ros-Lehtinen has been a vigorous proponent of recognition of the MEK, flying around the country to speak in support of unbanning the group and pressing the issue among fellow members of Congress. She has accepted an award from one group funding the campaign to delist the MEK. Other recipients of political donations, including Rogers, Filner and Rohrabacher, have also lobbied other members of Congress to support the unbanning. As a result, nearly 100 members of Congress have co-sponsored a resolution demanding the Obama administration to delist the MEK.</p> <p>Last month, 17 former senior officials and US generals called on the state department to remove the group's terrorist designation. Among them were General James Jones, Barack Obama's former national security adviser; Tom Ridge, the former homeland security director; as well as Mukasey, Freeh and Rendell.</p> <p>Some of the same politicians and former officials have also targeted newspapers and online publications in a campaign of opinion articles and letters aimed at changing the image of the MEK as a terrorist group.</p> <p>The campaign has in part been funded by substantial donations from Iranian Americans and a web of organisations they lead from Florida to Texas and California.</p> <p>The most generous benefactors include:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Saeid Ghaemi, head of Colorado's Iranian American Community</strong>, who paid close to $900,000 of his own money to a Washington lobby firm for its work to get the MEK unbanned.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ali Soudjani, president of the Iranian American Society of Texas.</strong> He gave close to $100,000 over the past five years to congressional campaign funds. His organisation paid more than $110,000 in fees to lobbyists last year.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ahmad Moeinimanesh, leader of the Iranian American Community of Northern California.</strong> The group paid $400,000 to a lobby firm. Moeinimanesh made personal donations to Ros-Lehtinen's campaign even though her constituency is several thousand miles from where he lives.</p> <p>Some of the payments have prompted an investigation by the US treasury department. It is examining the fees paid to Shelton, Freeh, Mukasey and Rendell, and possibly others, to see if they breach laws against \"material support for a terrorist group\". In cases involving links to other banned organisations, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, individuals have received long jail sentences for indirect financial support.</p> <p>The original source of the considerable sums involved is not always clear as groups making political donations or funding lobby firms are not required to declare their origin. Previously the MEK has relied in part on funding from Iraq under Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>Soudjani told the Guardian that the moneys were raised from Iranian Americans in the US. \"The Iranian community is wealthy. It has more than $600bn in the United States. This is pennies for supporting freedom,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked if his own donations to members of Congress was specifically because of their positions on the MEK, he replied: \"Yes, it is.\"</p> <p>However, Soudjani was careful to say that the support is not for the MEK as an organisation, which could open donors to investigation under anti-terrorism laws.</p> <p>\"We are not giving material support to the MEK. We are supporting freedom of speech for justice and peace in Iran,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing beats an argument over free speech and religion to bring out entrenched positions and prejudices. The saddest part of the street and rhetorical battles over the infamous anti-Muhammad video is that it plays to bigots on both sides.</p> <p>In pre-internet days, the musings of a saddo somewhere in the world would become known only to that person's close friends \u2013 plus the recipients of the odd green-ink letter. Now, you can draw attention to pretty much anything. Even so, it still took some time for the Innocence of Muslims to gain the attention its creator so desperately sought.</p> <p>The best description of the 14-minute video I have heard so far comes from Tony Blair (not a man I've taken to applaud too often in recent years). But the word \"laughable\" sums it up accurately. It is not worthy of being taken seriously. As for the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, this is a satirical magazine: horses for courses.</p> <p>Beneath the welter of comment and emotion, there has been a reluctance to debate the principles underlying this supposed clash of civilisations. On one point, most agree: violence is unacceptable. So far, so easy.</p> <p>But what about incitement to violence? Direct incitement \u2013 \"I don't like Mr Cohen/Mr Singh who lives in number 22, I suggest we go after him\" \u2013 is clear. But is \"insult\", which could lead to violence, the same thing? Andrew Brown, writing in the Guardian, appeared to think so, when he argued: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/sep/12/libya-anti-muhammad-youtube-clips\" title=\"\">This film is purely and simply an incitement to religious hatred</a>.\" He added that it was \"obviously blasphemous to Muslims\".</p> <p>This typifies a merging of distinctive issues. Incitement is a direct exhortation to violence. It is not saying something that could lead to violence by people who feel offended. Nor is it the same as religious and racial hatred, which in turn is separate from \"blasphemy\".</p> <p>Who better to turn to on these issues than Aryeh Neier? A long-time leading light of Human Rights Watch and the Open Society Foundation, he stumbled into this maelstrom more than 40 years ago. More than 40 years ago, as head of the American Civil Liberties Union, Neier (a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany) defended the right of a neo-Nazi group to march through Skokie, Illinois, home to a number of Holocaust survivors. He has since reflected long and hard about his decision.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/freedom--blasphemy--and-violence-by-aryeh-neier\" title=\"\">Writing this week, Neier said</a>: \"It is important to differentiate blasphemy from hate speech. What is objectionable about hate speech, and makes it punishable by law in countries around the world, is that it is intended to incite discrimination or violence against members of a particular national, racial, ethnic, or religious group.\" Yet he added: \"Judgments about literary or artistic merit should not be the basis for decisions about freedom of expression. The proclivity of some elsewhere to react violently to what they consider blasphemous cannot be the criterion for imposing limits on free expression.\"</p> <p>Do some folk need more protecting than others? It might be bad taste to disparage, say, the Cornish, or vegetarians, but unless I've missed something I haven't come across too many wounded souls. It's important, therefore, to achieve some clarity in questions of treatment. Does the recent focus on \"blasphemy\" suggest a special dispensation for religion? In an attempt to defuse tensions, the EU, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the Arab League and the African Union issued a message reiterating \"profound respect for all religions\". They then added, in a classic fudge: \"While fully recognising freedom of expression, we believe in the importance of respecting all prophets, regardless of which religion they belong to.\"</p> <p>If, as this seems to imply, speech might be circumscribed to protect religious belief (a suggestion most would surely bridle at), should all religions be treated the same? If so, issues around particular grievances (Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel-Palestine, Guant\u00e1namo, take your pick) become irrelevant.</p> <p>Does Islam require special favours? In the New York Times, Thomas Friedman suggested that Muslims are just as likely to impugn other religions as they are likely to be upset themselves. Most of the recent free expression-v-offence battles have revolved around Islam \u2013 from the Satanic Versus to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/07/terrorism.religion\" title=\"\">Theo van Gogh</a> to the Danish cartoons to now. That is not to say that other religions and races do not complain, but the nature of the grievance \u2013 real or manufactured \u2013 appears to be of a different magnitude.</p> <p>As an ardent advocate of free expression, my instinct is always to hold to first principles. Barring direct incitement or other clearly illegal activity (such as child pornography), one should surely trust in common sense, while seeking to ignore and isolate rather than ban. A thick skin is the essence of a&#xa0;mature society.</p> <p>These first principles are most vividly enshrined in the US first amendment. But for many in the Middle East and elsewhere, that amendment is another example of cultural hegemony. For as long as freedom of expression is seen in parts of the world as a US \"import\" buttressing against cultural and religious sensitivity, rather than a universal right and requirement, nothing will be solved.</p>",
  "<p>The former justice secretary Ken Clarke has been accused by Labour of giving a \"positively misleading\" impression that judges will have the key say in deciding whether new secret courts will be convened to hear sensitive intelligence material.</p> <p>In a sign that the plans are heading for a rocky parliamentary ride this autumn, the shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan, has written to Nick Clegg to say Labour cannot support the plans unless ministers change their \"misguided\" approach. Khan is intervening days before the Lib Dems debate a motion at their conference in Brighton calling for a watering down of the plans to set up a new generation of secret courts.</p> <p>The Lib Dem deputy prime minister supports the plans after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/apr/04/human-rights-committee-hidden-justice\" title=\"\">securing a series of concessions from Clarke</a>, who remains responsible for the bill after he lost his job as justice secretary. These include assurances that the courts will only be used in exceptional cases where there are concerns over national security.</p> <p>But Khan says that one of Clegg's main demands \u2013 that judges, not ministers will decide when the special courts are invoked \u2013 has not been met. In his letter, Khan writes: \"This is not the judge-led process that Ken Clarke has claimed. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is positively misleading to claim it is judge-led. Ministers retain the power on what is kept secret \u2013 meaning the usual checks and balances that provide proper scrutiny of government action will not be present.\"</p> <p>The shadow justice secretary singled out Clarke for criticism after he used a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/justice-and-security-bill-on-track?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Guardian article this week</a> to claim that judges would have the upper hand in deciding whether sensitive intelligence is placed before the secret courts. \"Judges and not the executive will have to take the key decisions about whether a closed hearing is justified,\" Clarke wrote.</p> <p>The proposals are designed to ensure that intelligence material that cannot currently be heard in court can be admitted as evidence by restricting its circulation. The intelligence would be heard by a judge but not by claimants or their lawyers.</p> <p>The bill was drawn up after the public airing of evidence during litigation brought on behalf of Binyam Mohamed and other former Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees. The court of appeal agreed to disclose CIA information which showed that MI5 and MI6 knew Mohamed, a British resident, had been abused.</p> <p>Khan, who is understood to have been briefed by Clarke on privy council terms, calls on Clegg to give serious consideration to alternatives to the \"close material procedures\". He writes: \"It is simply wrong to claim, as justice ministers do, that if CMPs are not introduced, intelligence officers would be forced to give evidence in public courts. Such claims totally ignore how our current system has different ways of coping with these kinds of circumstances. Rather than a misguided rush to legislation, the government would have been better advised to hold a proper debate about all the options available.\"</p>",
  "<p>A pledge by the new BBC director general, George Entwistle, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/19/george-entwistle-bbc-women-presenters?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">to put more older women on screen</a> has suffered a blow with the former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly making a formal complaint about the \"hostile attitude\" of corporation executives in the wake of her ageism case.</p> <p>In a fiercely critical, 1,800-word letter to the BBC's head of complaints, O'Reilly said apologies and offers of work from Entwistle and his predecessor, Mark Thompson, were \"clearly just a PR damage-limitation exercise\".</p> <p>O'Reilly, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/11/miriam-oreilly-bbc-ageism-victory?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">successfully took the BBC to an employment tribunal</a> after she was dropped from Countryfile three years ago, said she felt she had no option but to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/25/miriam-oreilly-interview-bbc-women\" title=\"\">leave the BBC this year, just nine months into a three-year deal</a>. She said it was \"very quickly clear that I was not going to receive fair treatment\" and alleged that a member of the production team on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/apr/08/miriam-oreilly-crimewatch-roadshow\" title=\"\">only TV project she presented on her return, BBC1's Crimewatch Roadshow</a>, \"appeared to be on a mission to humiliate and undermine my confidence.</p> <p>\"One one occasion he was cueing me as 'Hayley' during a live broadcast and laughing,\" said O'Reilly. \"When we came off air and I asked him why, he said it was because I reminded him of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayley_Cropper\" title=\"\">Hayley Cropper, a transsexual character in Coronation Street</a>.

He derisively said he did not want me to eat with the team in the evening as I had to be 'fresh' to remember my lines in the morning.\"</p> <p>The revelations will embarrass Entwistle, who began his \u00a3450,000-a-year role on Monday and used his first week in the job to declare he wanted to put more women on BBC television and radio. Entwistle said in various interviews that he wanted to see more women on BBC News, including a second regular female presenter on BBC Radio 4's Today, and more coverage of women's sport. Entwistle <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/apr/08/miriam-oreilly-crimewatch-roadshow\" title=\"\">wrote to O'Reilly in January</a>, when he was still in his previous job of director of BBC Vision, saying he \"wanted to get in touch to thank you for all your help on the projects you've undertaken for us in the last year, specifically Crimewatch Roadshow, and to assure you we would like very much to discuss working with you again once your break was over\".</p> <p>The new director general said in an interview in the Radio Times that he did not know when she would be back on screen: \"If she comes up with a brilliant idea, I would love to have her back.\"</p> <p>O'Reilly said in her letter to Jessica Cecil, the BBC's chief complaints officer and head of the director general's office: \"Apologies and offers of work after my tribunal win from Mark Thompson and George Entwistle were clearly just a PR damage limitation exercise as nothing has materialised. Despite the BBC saying publicly that it accepted the unanimous findings of the tribunal, what happened privately tells a very different story.\"</p> <p>She said the lack of work on Radio 4, despite it being included in her contract, and her treatment on Crimewatch Roadshow led her to believe she was \"never going to be treated justly or fairly so I decided for the sake of my health to step back\". A subsequent TV programme idea that she pitched was not taken up.</p> <p>O'Reilly expressed surprise that she had not been invited to take part in subsequent discussions of ageism, including her case, on Radio 4 and BBC1,She said she believed a senior executive had attempted to persuade programme makers not to include a photograph of her in a discussion about ageism in the media in BBC1's Sunday Morning Live, which was broadcast on 2 September. \"One would think since my case was <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2098498/I-got-wrong-older-women-BBC-boss-admits-ARE-TV.html\" title=\"\">what Mark Thompson called the 'turning point' in the ageism debate</a>, that I might have been invited to comment. Of course if this didn't suit editorially, then fine,\" she wrote.</p> <p>\"This cumulative action is not what one would expect of a fair and balanced BBC, but it clearly shows the level of animosity which exists and which has denied me my career.\"I won my case unanimously, but the attitude of some executives following my return to work shows a contempt for the law. The way I've been treated isn't worthy of the BBC, or what the BBC stands for.\"</p> <p>A BBC spokesman said: \"The BBC has apologised both privately and publicly to Miriam for what happened to her and, as an organisation, we have made sure we learned lessons from it. As recently as this week George Entwistle said he would welcome Miriam back to the BBC if she had a great idea for a programme \u2013 the same challenge he has laid down to programme-makers nationwide.</p> <p>\"It would not be right however for Miriam to appear on every single debate about ageism across the BBC as it would risk limiting the range of voices and opinions that audiences could hear.\"</p> <h2><strong>The BBC and women</strong></h2> <p><strong>Today </strong>Sarah Montague is the only regular female presenter on Radio 4's Today.

  "<p>If only the politicians would tell us what they really think, we say. If only they'd drop the soundbites and the focus-group-tested messaging and give it to us straight. Two politicians did just that this week. They granted us an unimpeded look into their true souls \u2013 and it wasn't pretty.</p> <p>Nick Clegg was not one of them. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/sep/20/nick-clegg-apology-tuition-fees-video\" title=\"\">His apology</a> over his broken tuition fee promise was meant to look candid and genuine, but it was as much a made-for-video stunt as his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXw7yqHfxDI\" title=\"\">original pledge</a> \u2013 and, as one observer rightly noted, took the curious form of a husband saying \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliaHB1/status/248499548178239488\" title=\"\">sorry for my affair; next time I won't vow to be faithful</a>\".</p> <p>The act of unbridled honesty was committed instead by the chief whip Andrew Mitchell who, living up to his \"Thrasher\" nickname, gave a tongue-lashing to the police guarding Downing Street. Whether he called them \"f***ing plebs\" who ought to \"learn your f***ing place\", <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4549265/Andrew-Mitchell-insults-police-at-Downing-Street-by-calling-them-fing-plebs.html#ixzz277DyayRq\" title=\"\">as the Sun had it</a>, we may never know. But that Mitchell insulted men ready to risk their lives to protect him and his colleagues was confirmed when the chief whip telephoned the officer concerned to apologise.</p> <p>The damage will linger, suggesting this is what the government's most senior enforcer \u2013 a millionaire said to live as expensively as he was educated \u2013 really thinks: that the police are glorified servants who, if regrettably exempt these days from the obligation to bow and touch the forelock, ought at least to do what they're told by their betters. It is an ugly impression, one fast congealing in the public imagination as the defining feature of this government's top echelon: that they are a rich, over-privileged clique, out of touch with everyday life and with a nasty streak they cannot conceal.</p> <p>Luckily for David Cameron, Mitchell has next to no public profile and is in a job that requires even less. Unless more police officers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/andrew-mitchell-police-tirade-labour\" title=\"\">demand his head</a>, he can be quietly disappeared. Across the Atlantic, the Republican party's problem is somewhat graver. The man whose true self was exposed this week is their nominee for president, Mitt Romney.</p> <p>It bears repeating that, as former Reagan speechwriter <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2012/09/18/time-for-an-intervention/?mod=e2tw\" title=\"\">Peggy Noonan puts it</a>, this was meant to be the year \"the Republican presidential candidate almost couldn't lose\". Barack Obama has disappointed, his poll rating usually below 50% with unemployment stubbornly above 8%. A halfway decent, generic Republican should win this comfortably. The election is Romney's to lose \u2013 and he is doing his best to make that happen.</p> <p>The killer blow may well prove to be the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/watch-full-secret-video-private-romney-fundraiser\" title=\"\">secret video of his appearance</a> before a closed-door, $50,000-a-plate dinner for donors recorded in May but which surfaced this week. Much has been made of Romney's casual writing off of 47% of the American population as parasites who pay no income tax, see themselves as \"victims\", and believe the government owes them a living \u2013 to paraphrase only slightly \u2013 who will never vote for him anyway. As strategies for winning votes go, condemning half the electorate \u2013 including the millions of pensioners and veterans who receive benefits \u2013 is certainly novel.</p> <p>The candidate's remarks on Middle East peace were not much more politic, attacking the Palestinians as bent on Israel's destruction and admitting that his game plan for the conflict would simply be to \"kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen\".</p> <p>But while these specifics are gobsmacking, it's the overall tone of Romney unplugged that is so striking. Read the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/full-transcript-mitt-romney-secret-video#nodeal\" title=\"\">full transcript</a> and you realise that you are eavesdropping on a meeting of the 1%, a conclave of the cosseted super-rich of which Romney is so clearly a part.</p> <p>He begins with a quip about inheritance planning, which clearly resonates with his audience. He gets another laugh when he jokes about immigration, chuckling that if \"you have no skill or experience \u2026 you're welcome to cross the border and stay here for the rest of your life\". Romney goes on to voice the perennial, if improbable, complaint of the privileged white male: that life would be so much easier if he were fashionably ethnic. Recalling that his father was born in Mexico to American parents, he muses that \"had he been born of Mexican parents I'd have a better shot at winning this \u2026 it'd be helpful if they'd been Latino\".</p> <p>That's not the only instance of what is said to be a common feature of the extremely wealthy: self-pity. An audience member complains that people don't realise how hard it is for multimillionaires like them: \"We kill ourselves, we don't work a nine to five. We're away from our families five days&#xa0;a&#xa0;week.\" Romney shouldn't apologise for his wealth, they tell him,&#xa0;he should be proud of it. But \"I'm as poor as a church mouse\", the candidate replies \u2013 and, in that company, he might well be.</p> <p>The Romney caught on video could not be less appealing, a Monty Burns caricature of a heartless plutocrat. The persona his aides have worked so hard to construct is left shattered into a thousand glassy pieces. They brag of his devotion as a husband. But at the fundraiser he speaks of his wife in terms that are icily transactional: \"We use Ann sparingly right now, so that people don't get tired of her.\"</p> <p>The word \"gaffe\" doesn't do justice to this. Gaffe is adding an \"e\" to the end of the word \"potato\", <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/quayle3.htm\" title=\"\">as Dan Quayle did</a>, or forgetting the third government department you plan to close, which <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15680178\" title=\"\">undid Romney's Republican rival Rick Perry</a>. This is gaffe as diagnosed by the commentator Michael Kinsley: when the mask slips and a politician accidentally tells the truth about themselves.</p> <p>Something similar happened to Obama four years ago when \u2013 also at a closed-door fundraiser \u2013 he mused on those <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/14/barackobama.uselections2008\" title=\"\">small-town voters who get \"bitter\"</a> at the state of their lives and so \"cling to guns or religion\". He would never have put it like that publicly, but it exposed an Ivy League condescension that was real.</p> <p>Such moments are not trivial but illuminating. The Romney tape, for example, reveals an Ayn Rand, survival-of-the-fittest philosophy, pitting <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-a-republican-mind-set-without-promise/2012/09/20/798901f8-0344-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story.html\" title=\"\">the \"makers\" against the \"takers\"</a>, that is crucial to understanding today's Republican party. And somehow, for all the complaints of control and artifice, the much-derided modern presidential campaign rarely fails to produce such moments of clarity. Yes, it is flawed \u2013 both too long and too costly. But it provides a priceless service, a scrutiny from which no candidate can hide.</p> <p>Being president \"reveals who you are,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/michelle-obama-democratic-convention-live\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama told the Democratic convention</a> earlier this month. Running for president does the same thing. The trouble for Mitt Romney is&#xa0;that not many Americans like what they see.</p> <p><em>Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland?tw_i=244868341578211328&amp;tw_e=screenname&amp;tw_p=tweetembed\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of officers, including armed-response teams, have been drafted in from neighbouring forces to help overstretched police in Greater Manchester tackle the vicious gang feud that is said to have claimed the lives of two officers, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>Round-the-clock police patrols continued in east Manchester and Tameside as the investigation into the killings of two police officers, PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, went on against a backdrop of heightened tensions. There was tight security at Manchester city magistrates court on Friday morning as Dale Cregan, 29, appeared before magistrates charged with four murders \u2013 those of the two constables and Mark Short, 23, and his father David, 46. He was remanded in custody and will appear before the city's crown court on Monday.</p> <p>Criminals have been active in the city as the attention of the force concentrates on the violent fallout ascribed to a long-running feud between two crime families around the Droylsden and Clayton districts to the east.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, masked raiders dressed in high-visibility jackets walked into Selfridges in Manchester city centre, smashing display cabinets with axes and crowbars and grabbing \u00a3500,000 of watches in an audacious 80-second raid.</p> <p>It was an attack that sources say was not a coincidence, as police focused on Tameside and Old Trafford where Manchester United were playing that night. The feuding between the two families in east Manchester appears to have been caused by an incident when a&#xa0;woman was slapped in the face by a man in a pub in east Manchester earlier this year. The incident lit the touchpaper for violence, the like of which has&#xa0;not been witnessed in Greater Manchester, involving grenades and firearms.</p> <p>Senior officers believe that organised crime \"does not get noticed and is dismissed by many as something that involves criminals against criminals\". A&#xa0;police source said that the feud between the two families has been going on for 10 years.</p> <p>In recent times, scant intelligence has been passed on to police and all appeared quiet, until the pub incident. While people were happy to give information to the police, few were willing to make formal statements, perhaps for fear of repercussions. Both families involved in the feud allegedly run chaotic criminal empires. They are suspected of focusing on cannabis farms, illegal property deals and the handling of stolen goods, \"fencing\" on a vast scale. Extortion and violence go hand in hand with their activities.</p> <p>This week, Garry Shewan, the assistant chief constable, urged the two crime families to end the feud and said that Tuesday was a watershed and \"enough is enough\". Greater Manchester police's chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, has said that those who believe organised crime has nothing to do with them, need to think again: \"The important thing is for people to realise this is not the stuff of films or books. When you have jewellery stolen or a car stolen, when you are burgled, when there is drug dealing in your area, it is these kinds of criminal outfits that are doing it. Some people think it doesn't effect them; it does.\"</p> <p>Gun crime has fallen dramatically in Manchester, which in the 1980s and 90s struggled to shake off the nickname of Gunchester. But serious firearms are still available, with one source claiming in the Manchester Evening News this week&#xa0;that hand grenades can be purchased for as little as \u00a350 if you know where to look.</p> <p>An American man, Steven Greenoe, smuggled more than 60 high-powered weapons into Britain in 2010 through Manchester airport in his luggage. He is now in jail in the United States but the vast majority of the firearms he trafficked are still in circulation and have been used before in shootings in Manchester and Merseyside.</p> <p>The firearms include 11 Glock 19 handguns, which have a magazine containing 15 rounds. Latest statistics show that in Greater Manchester between April 2011 and March 2012 there were 39 firearms fired, resulting in deaths of four occasions. Gun crime has been falling, year on year, for the last decade. In contrast, at the height of the \"Gunchester\" era, 27 people died and 250 were injured over a troubled five-year period.</p> <p>The history of Manchester gangs is by no means a new problem \u2013 it dates back to the late 19th century, when parts of the city were the turf of the most feared \"scuttlers\", with rival gangs engaging in fatal knife battles. In recent years, the focus has predominantly been south of the city centre, in Longsight and Moss Side, where high unemployment and the arrival of crack cocaine prompted a violent war on the streets.</p> <p>Operation Xcalibre was set up eight years ago to tackle the guns menace that was blighting communities and affecting the national perception of the city. The breakthrough came three years later following the shooting of Tyrone Gilbert at the funeral of Ucal Chin, a young father with friends in the Longsight crew. The rival Gooch gang leaders Lee Amos and Colin Joyce opened fire into a crowd of mourners as they drove into the crowd of 90 people. Senior police described the pair as psychopaths.</p> <p>When 11 members of the gang were later convicted at Liverpool crown court following an intensive police operation, shootings tailed off enormously. But there are new, worrying trends emerging.</p> <p>The violence&#xa0;has switched to areas such as Salford \u2013 where innocent Indian postgraduate student Anuj Bidve was murdered on Boxing Day last year by Kiaran Stapleton after he inadvertently wandered into his patch \u2013 and to the deprived estates east of the city. Hattersley has struggled to shake off its reputation following the Moors murders in the 1960s, since Myra Hindley and Ian Brady lived nearby. And Britain's most prolific serial killer, Dr Harold Shipman, who murdered 215 patients, lived and worked just up the road in Hyde.</p> <p>On the Hattersley estate in Mottram where the officers died, residents began&#xa0;to speak out against the perception that the community routinely presented a wall of silence to the police. Lisa Holmes said the vast majority of locals were not criminals and dismissed the suggestion that known members of crime groups were treated as folk heroes.</p> <p>\"The suggestion that children on the estate welcome home violent criminals and look up to them is wrong,\" she said. \"My child attends Arundale primary school on John Kennedy Road and as a mother, I know most of the children there. They are frightened at the thought of the criminals and certainly wouldn't sit praising them and welcome them to their area where they play.\"</p> <p>Along with other residents, she's organising a vigil for the officers next week and added: \"Hattersley doesn't stand for what happened on that fateful day.\"</p> <p>Patsy Mckie, founder of the charity Mothers Against Violence, established to combat gang violence in south Manchester, said: \"What we are seeing now is feuding families, rather than just gangs. I've seen a change in what's happening with regards to gangs.\"</p> <p>When she began her work, she said the gangs were involved in violence within their own community in Moss Side and Longsight. \"They were shooting each other for different kinds of reasons. It might have started off with drugs, it might be to do with guns. Or where you live, or don't live, where you can move or not move, the young people decided the lines drawn in sand. But what we are seeing now is feuds.\"</p> <p>She acknowledges that there have always been feuds, but now she believes the emphasis is shifting, \"which makes us think about the responsibilities of communities and how they live their lives and [take] responsibility for things that happen there,\" she added.</p> <p>Three miles east of the city centre, past Manchester City's stadium, Clayton, where David Short died on 10 August, is poor, but fiercely proud, a tight-knit community of red-brick council homes.</p> <p>Canon Ansbro, of St Willibrords Roman Catholic church, officiated at Mark Short's funeral. \"They weren't regulars at church,\" he said. \"They came here because they wanted us to hold Mark's funeral. I'd not seen him myself for years, since he was at school. But I met his father and mother. I don't really know them, but I took the funeral as the family requested it.\"</p> <p>A publican in Clayton, perhaps reflecting the reluctance to speak about Short, told the Guardian: \"I did know David Short and I do know of him but I'd rather not say any more.\"</p> <p>The Rev Rob Weir, who is a methodist minister in Clayton, said people were wary of walking through the nearby nature reserve at night, but generally the area is not as bad as it is often portrayed in the media.</p> <p>\"I know someone in the area who had to go through a police cordon to get to their house after the murder of David Short, but not the main players. In Clayton, there are an awful lot of people who are just going about their everyday lives, and something like this where people are throwing grenades near where they live is shocking as it happened on their doorstep.\"</p> <p>Tony Lloyd, Manchester central MP and Labour candidate for the city's first elected police commissioner, said that a lot of people who live in Clayton lead normal lives and that the activities of the criminal families do not impinge on them.</p> <p>He pointed out that gun crime in the city is at a 10-year low. He is not in favour of arming the police and said that the majority of those in Mottram had greeted the police officers' deaths with \"shock, horror and disbelief and a sense of impotence\".</p> <p>He said that most people felt solidarity with the victims.</p>",
  "<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v52FLMOPSig?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v52FLMOPSig\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It's always heartwarming to see former political big hitters lend their support to new contenders. In the highest echelons of power, we've seen Bill Clinton grudgingly throw his weight behind Barack Obama, George Bush formally endorse John McCain, and Sarah Palin praise the Romney/Ryan ticket. While these stamps of approval must inevitably sometimes be seen as proverbial albatrosses, every so often they can be just the boost you need.</p> <p>Now imagine the coup if an entire presidential staff were persuaded to record a video in support of a candidate for Michigan's supreme court. Lucky Bridget Mary McCormack then, for she has managed just that. President Josiah Bartlet (leader of the free world: 1999-2007), and his staff have recorded a message to persuade the great people of Michigan to be aware of the non-partisan candidates on the ballot, and in particular, for McCormack. The video has gone viral, and caught the eye of many a media outlet not previously inclined to cover the local election with such enthusiasm. This shouldn't surprise anyone, given that Jed Bartlet has regularly been voted America's most popular president, with approval ratings that would make even Mitt Romney finally embrace those pesky 47%.</p> <p>Of course, you know that there was no \"real\" President Bartlet. But for those of us who watched the West Wing with an almost religious zeal during the Bush years, it was hard not to wish that there was. The fictional president was a studious and thoughtful man, with a degree of honesty and belief that voters don't usually find in real politicians. His staff were passionate, hard working and often too attractive for Washington (hello, Josh Lyman, Charlie Young et al). </p> <p>Throughout each of the seven seasons, we followed the frustrations of governance and came to understand just how seriously the characters took it. This was often in stark contrast to the famous gaffes of George Bush, which only made the fictitious White House seem that much more competent.</p> <p>Since the West Wing has secured its place in TV history with its enduring popularity, Bridget Mary McCormack may very well have played her trump card. The video is bereft of the opulent White House set, and it's hard to explain non-partisan candidacy in a particularly gripping manner, but despite this, the short film manages to capture the basic essence of the series. The famous \"walk and talk\" is there, as is the Aaron Sorkin-like lofty dialogue that can veer dangerously towards pretension. </p> <p>As the nostalgia for these particularly loved in-jokes builds, fans will be sure to check out McCormack's credentials, and no doubt enjoy her close link to one of the cast (she is Mary McCormack's sister). By any stretch, she will be more recognised today than she ever could have been previously. You cannot buy this kind of spotlight unless you are actually the president.</p> <p>Without wanting to criticize my beloved political dream team, I might offer two criticisms of the short reunion. The first is whether a globally watched video actually can make the desired impact in one specific state. As one YouTube viewer said: \"Good luck on your campaign..wish I lived there to vote for you!\" </p> <p>And therein lies the problem. Whilst I'm prepared to pack up my bags and ship off to Michigan to vote in a West Wing-endorsed race, will it convince the locals? Hollywood has a record of turning off voters when they engage in the electoral process. Will the Michigan electorate really listen to the points made on the video, or will the problem of low voter engagement for non-partisan candidates remain just that?</p> <p>The more obvious problem with this kind of campaign is the realization that we live in a world where a fictional president is more effective at capturing the electorate's attention than the wars, recession and global warming that some of us will actually face in our lives. </p> <p>Does the affection reserved for a TV show that ended six years ago still have the power to make people get out and vote? And what does it say if our real politicians can never muster this kind of loyal turnout? </p> <p>It's unlikely that I'll be watching the state supreme court results, however. I've remembered I still have West Wing box sets I could be re-watching.</p>",
  "<p>A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the South African politician Julius Malema on charges of corruption.</p> <p>Malema, who was expelled from the governing African National Congress (ANC) this year and has become an outspoken critic of President Jacob Zuma, is expected to appear in court next week.</p> <p>South Africa's City Press newspaper reported that the warrant <a href=\"http://www.citypress.co.za/Politics/News/Breaking-Arrest-warrant-issued-for-Malema-20120921\" title=\"\">related to charges of fraud, money laundering and corruption</a> involving government contracts. Malema has always vehemently protested his innocence.</p> <p>Nicqui Galaktiou, a lawyer for Malema, said she had not yet seen the contents of the warrant. \"We were notified today that a warrant had been issued and we have been negotiating with the authorities regarding Mr Malema's appearance in court,\" she told eNews Channel Africa \"He will hand himself over voluntarily at a court appearance next week.\"</p> <p>The case would be heard in Polokwane in Limpopo, Malema's home province, Galaktiou added. The date has not yet been confirmed.</p> <p>Malema, 31, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/01/anc-african-national-congress-southafrica\" title=\"\">removed as president of the ANC Youth League</a> in March but remains one of South Africa's most electrifying politicians. He seized on the recent industrial unrest to call for a national mining strike, turning himself into a lightning rod for workers' anger over the yawning gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>But critics regard him as an opportunistic demagogue who has cynically manipulated the situation in an attempt to revive his political career and oust Zuma.</p> <p>Asked if the charges were politically motivated, Galaktiou replied: \"That is our belief up to now. Once we've seen the charges, we'll have a better idea.\"</p> <p>At a press conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday, Malema claimed that Zuma was likely to move against him. \"If we are illegally arrested tomorrow, we would have been arrested by Jacob Zuma,\" he said.</p> <p>Malema was willing and ready to go to jail and was not intimidated, he added. \"I have nothing to hide \u2026 I only have my convictions. Nothing will stop me from fighting for economic freedom, not even my death ... We are unshaken.\"</p> <p>Reports that Malema is facing arrest have been swirling since long before the crisis erupted at the Marikana mine. He has been under investigation by the elite Hawks detective unit for alleged corruption relating to his Ratanang Family Trust and its shareholding in On-Point Engineering, a company that has made millions of rand from government tenders in Limpopo.</p> <p>A separate report into the matter by South Africa's anti-corruption ombudsman, the public protector, is also said to be imminent.</p> <p>Many commentators have questioned how a self-proclaimed champion of the poor can fund a lavish lifestyle that includes champagne parties, a Breitling watch and a Mercedes-Benz. In a recent interview with the Guardian at his home in Sandton, dubbed the wealthiest square mile in Africa, Malema denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>\"I'm waiting for the day I'm going to be charged with corruption because to be judged that I've got where I am because of corruption is incorrect,\" he said. \"There is no judge or any credible institution which has arrived at that conclusion. For as far as I'm concerned, I'm innocent until proven otherwise.</p> <p>\"How am I corrupt when I've never worked for government, I've never dished out tenders for government, I've never sat in any committee that gives tenders in government. How am I influencing those people? Who did I influence?\"</p> <p>Asked about his personal wealth, Malema replied: \"I'm not worth anything.

Half of what I have belongs to the bank.\"</p> <p>As in previous court appearances, Malema and his supporters are likely to spare no expense in mounting a legal defence.</p> <p>On Friday the opposition Democratic Alliance welcomed the arrest warrant. \"The South African public are sick and tired of politically connected individuals abusing public procurement to line their own pockets,\" said Dianne Kohler Barnard, the shadow police minister.</p> <p>\"Now that Julius Malema is outside of the ANC fold, he clearly lost the protection from law enforcement agencies that he once appeared to enjoy.\"</p>",
  "<p>A joint Franco-British investigation team has been set up to streamline inquiries into the deaths of a British family in the Alps as a French prosecutor admitted that bureaucratic obstacles had at times made progress \"extremely slow\".</p> <p>Surrey police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the unit would help improve co-operation in the inquiries into the killings of British engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old wife, Ikbal, her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, and Frenchman Sylvain Mollier, 45.</p> <p>The four victims were found shot dead on a forest road near the village of Chevaline on 5 September. The Hillis' seven-year-old daughter, Zeinab, had been shot and badly beaten, and her four-year-old sister, Zeena, was found hours later hiding beneath her mother's skirts.</p> <p>Despite the work of dozens of police officers on both side of the Channel, efforts to get to the bottom of the mysterious attack have yielded no suspects.</p> <p>Outlining the function of the joint team, public prosecutor Eric Maillaud said the inquiry had been hindered by differences between the French and British judicial processes.</p> <p>\"There is a shock of legal cultures which is making everything extremely slow,\" he told AFP.</p> <p>He said the team \u2013 which would bring officers from Surrey police, representatives of the CPS and gendarmes from nearby Chamb\u00e9ry under the authority of two French investigating magistrates \u2013 would work \"as if they were in one country\" and \"as if there was no longer a border\".</p> <p>In a joint statement, Detective Chief Superintendent Adrian Harper and Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS South East Jaswant Narwal said: \"The establishment today of the Joint Investigation Team marks a significant step forward in progressing the murder investigation, enabling closer co-operation and greater understanding between the UK and French authorities, with a single focus of bringing to justice those responsible for these heinous crimes.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Surrey police said: \"We've had a very good ongoing relationship with the French authorities from the word go, but because it's an inquiry that's over two jurisdictions, that brings with it its own challenges. Having the [team] simplifies the way we can make our inquiries over here.\"</p> <p>In response to a claim by Maillaud that it had rejected several official requests for co-operation, the Home Office said in a statement it had \"co-operated fully with the French authorities\" on the case.</p> <p>Since 2000, EU member states have been able to form joint teams under the control of the EU judicial co-operation body Eurojust for specific investigations that stretch across two or more countries.</p> <p>Maillaud said this latest initiative would be the 25th established involving France but only the second between France and Britain. He suggested it could ultimately be expanded to cover other European countries such as Spain, where Saad al-Hilli's late father lived, Sweden, where Allaf lived, or Switzerland and Italy, where the killer or killers may have fled.</p> <p>Investigators on the case have said they are pursuing three main lines of inquiry into the deaths.</p> <p>The first centred on an alleged family feud after reports surfaced that Saad al-Hilli had been involved in a dispute with his brother over their father's inheritance. His brother, Zaid, has vehemently denied the reports. The second concerned Hilli's work as an engineer for different companies, and the third involved his roots in Iraq, where he was born and where he is believed to have returned two years ago in a bid to recoup some family assets.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/17/woman-jailed-taking-drugs-to-abort-child\" title=\"\">case of Sarah Catt</a>, jailed for 8 years for aborting her 38 week foetus, has prompted serious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/judicial-machismo-sarah-catt-britain-medieval\" title=\"\">questions about the appropriateness of a lengthy jail term</a> for a disturbed woman who poses no threat to the public. There are also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/21/judge-jailed-abortion-woman-christian\" title=\"\">concerns</a> about the impartiality of the judge, who has<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/21/judge-jailed-abortion-woman-christian\" title=\"\"> links to a Christian charity which has campaigned for more conservative abortion laws</a>. But the case raises another difficult legal question: what right does a woman have to determine the course of her own pregnancy?</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/87/contents\" title=\"\">Abortion Act 1967</a> does not address this issue directly. It simply makes abortion lawful in certain circumstances. Outside of these criteria, abortion remains unlawful by virtue of a patchwork of crimes, including the crime for which Catt was convicted \u2014 use of poison with intent to procure a miscarriage under <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/crossheading/attempts-to-procure-abortion\" title=\"\">section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1867</a>.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://t.co/jGHi4ftI\" title=\"\">judge commented</a>, she might also have been prosecuted for child destruction post-28 week gestation under <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/19-20/34/section/1\" title=\"\">section 1 of the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929</a>. There can be no doubt about the effect of these laws: any woman who aborts her child commits a criminal offence unless the abortion was authorised under the Abortion Act.</p> <p>The criminal law stands in interesting contrast to the law on forced interventions in a woman's pregnancy. Since the decision of the court of appeal in S v St George's Healthcare Trust [1999] Fam 26, a pregnant woman's right to refuse treatment has been admirably clear. Unless she is deemed to lack capacity under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents\" title=\"\">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a>, she has complete control over every decision affecting her unborn child. She can refuse medical treatment, such as caesarean section, that would save her child's life. The appeal court in S stated:</p> <blockquote> \"Although human, and protected by the law in a number of different ways \u2026 an unborn child is not a separate person from its mother. Its need for medical assistance does not prevail over her rights. She is entitled not to be forced to submit to an invasion of her body against her will, whether her own life or that of her unborn child depends on it. Her right is not reduced or diminished merely because her decision to exercise it may appear morally repugnant.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>How can this be squared with criminalisation of women who carry out unauthorised abortions? There is, of course, a distinction between acts of omission and commission, but the court of appeal's twin assertions of female autonomy and the indivisibility of mother and foetus undermine the logic of the criminal law.</p> <p>In the United States, the court of appeals for the ninth circuit very recently considered the prosecution of a woman for an unauthorised abortion at 21 weeks in <a href=\"http://us9thcircuitcourtofappealsopinions.justia.com/2012/09/11/mccormack-v-hiedeman/\" title=\"\">McCormack v Hiedeman</a>. The court found the historical purpose for regulating abortion had been to protect, rather than punish women and held that abortion laws should not be used to prosecute a woman for aborting her child.</p> <p>The facts of the Catt case were extreme. But before prosecuting women for abortion and passing lengthy jail terms, we should ask whether our laws are coherent and, indeed, whether criminalisation is ever appropriate.</p>",
  "<p>Universal Music chairman and chief executive Lucian Grainge has reiterated his pledge to make \u00a3100m in annual savings after buying EMI, despite being forced to sell off nearly a third of the British group, while also promising to revitalise famous labels such as Virgin Records.</p> <p>Grainge told investors that one rationale for Universal's \u00a31.2bn bid for EMI Music was the ability to find \u00a3100m in annual savings.</p> <p>However the European Commission said on Friday that Universal must <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/21/universal-emi-takeover-approved\" title=\"\">sell off about 30% of EMI</a> \u2013 including more than half its presence in Europe \u2013 including jewels such as Parlophone, home to Coldplay.</p> <p>\"That's the plan,\" said Grainge when asked if he was sticking to the \u00a3100m cuts target.</p> <p>\"This was an incredible deal, an amazing deal. Capitol, Virgin, EMI, the Beatles, Robbie Williams and wholly-owned EMI businesses in the top three markets \u2013 the US, Japan and Germany.

I don't want to get caught in the weeds of the financials, we are extremely happy.\"</p> <p>Grainge also confirmed that he had scotched an attempt by Sir Richard Branson to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/19/branson-universal-music-virgin-records?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">buy back the Virgin Records label</a>, although Universal is selling Virgin Classics.</p> <p>\"We will do our best refloat Virgin, I'm absolutely committed to it,\" he said.</p> <p>Grainge denied the accusation that with less competition Universal's takeover of EMI would mean fewer releases and less investment.</p> <p>\"I'm glad you asked that, it means exactly the opposite,\" he said. \"It is one of the most incredible companies and we want to halt its decline. It's gone from what, 18% to 10% share, all these companies were neck and neck. Look at the amount of new releases EMI has put out.</p> <p>\"We will take our synergies, take our courage and increase investment in EMI. We will make more music and take more intelligent risks ... and there will be more people creating it, more A&amp;R. We have to fill the gap.\"</p> <p>Grainge was bullish that the enforced asset sale \u2013 which will include EMI operations in nine European countries and labels such as Chrysalis, Mute and Sanctuary, home to artists including Spandau Ballet, Depeche Mode and Iron Maiden respectively \u2013 will draw premium bids and that Universal will not lose out by offloading them.</p> <p>\"The good news about the divestment procedure is what we are selling is really good quality rights and industrial structure,\" he said. \"There is a lot of interest. Too say I'm optimistic is a weak term.\"</p> <p>The European Commission noted that it needed to insert a clause restricting Universal's power in digital music because even Apple could not \"defeat price increase or other types of worsening of licensing terms by Universal\".</p> <p>Grainge scoffed at the notion that Universal would try and suffocate or control the digital market.</p> <p>\"I have a responsibility and duty to various stakeholders, primarily artists and the creative ecosystem, to create and sell as much music in as many ways and on as many platforms in an as agnostic a way as I humanly can,\" he said. \"Google, Apple, Amazon, Spotify, we are out there fighting, hunting to get this in as many places as possible.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>The Italian artist Arnaldo Putzu, who has died aged 85, was one of&#xa0;the most distinctive illustrators of his generation, painting film posters \u2013 from Italian realist cinema to the Carry On series \u2013 and book and magazine covers. While his long career started and finished in Italy, his work in Britain encapsulated the whole look of popular illustration in the 1960s and&#xa0;70s.</p> <p>Putzu was born in Rome, the son of&#xa0;a&#xa0;senior Italian navy officer. At about the age of 10, he began painting seriously, studied art at the Rome Academy, and found a love of&#xa0;portraiture, which he practised by&#xa0;painting his relatives. While doing illustration work in Milan in 1948, he&#xa0;met the poster artist Enrico de Seta, who took him back to Rome to work at&#xa0;the heart of the booming Italian film&#xa0;industry.</p> <p>After four years with De Seta, Putzu felt confident enough to set up his own studio. He worked for, among others, Augusto Favalli, who then controlled a dazzling roster of artists employed by the Cinecitt\u00e0 film studios. Putzu created some of the most famous Italian film posters of the 50s and early 60s, painting such stars as Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida. His depiction of the voluptuous female figure in Poor But Handsome in 1956 was condemned by&#xa0;the Pope.</p> <p>The most powerful British film company of the period was Rank, which controlled a network of overseas distribution offices, including an outpost in Rome. A Rank executive based there, Geoff Martin, was impressed by the poster artwork coming out of Studio Favalli and spotted an opportunity. In collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/sep/15/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Eric Pulford</a>, creative head of Rank's UK agency Downton Advertising, the studio gradually began employing Italian artists to work on British film publicity. At first Pulford simply flew back and forth between London and Rome, carrying bulging suitcases full of artwork, but by the late 1950s the artists themselves were being brought over to Britain. One of the most brilliant of&#xa0;them, Renato Fratini, was based in&#xa0;the UK throughout the 1960s.</p> <p>Putzu, a friend of Fratini, began to&#xa0;work for Pulford in the late 1950s. His&#xa0;first British poster was for The&#xa0;Secret Place (1957), featuring an atmospheric portrait of the Rank starlet Belinda Lee. With his UK commissions steadily increasing, Putzu was keen to join Fratini. He arrived in Britain in&#xa0;1967 and went to work on the poster for Morecambe and Wise's film The&#xa0;Magnificent Two.</p> <p>After a couple of years Putzu was given an office in the Great Portland Street studios of Feref Associates, a&#xa0;new breakaway group of five former Downton artists, led by the designer Eddie Paul, who specialised in film work&#xa0;and had gained several major distributor accounts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396509471\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348248980267/Arnaldo-Putzu-008.jpg\" alt=\"Arnaldo Putzu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arnaldo Putzu at work on a Carry On film poster</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When, in 1973, Fratini died, Putzu found himself the top-rated and most in-demand poster illustrator working in Britain. His output over the 1970s included oddball Hammer Horror fantasies such as Creatures the World Forgot and Legend of the 7&#xa0;Golden Vampires. For the Get Carter posters he put the ruthless gangster Michael Caine into an unlikely floral jacket, demonstrating the whimsical humour that makes his best posters unforgettable.</p> <p>At the same time he made another key contact in Colin Shelbourn, art editor at the newly launched children's TV magazine Look-In, who wanted an illustrator to give his weekly covers a cinematic look. Putzu thus painted almost every Look-In cover from 1973 through to 1981, and in the process amassed a vivid catalogue of 70s popular culture, from On the Buses to&#xa0;the Bay City Rollers.</p> <p>By the end of the decade, the rate of&#xa0;his commissions was slowing. With cinema audiences in decline, painted artwork for film posters was starting to look like an expensive luxury to increasingly cash-strapped distributors. Putzu's final British posters appeared around 1980, and included titles such as the nostalgic war-drama The Sea Wolves and a blockbusting reissue of&#xa0;Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway, featuring Steve McQueen snarling down the barrel of a gun. Meanwhile, at Look-In the focus became pop, illustrated with photographs rather than artwork. There were a few later TV-personality posters, but by the mid-80s Putzu's commercial work had dwindled, and \u2013 rather reluctantly, for he loved Britain \u2013 he flew back to Rome in October 1985.</p> <p>Putzu continued to paint, turning to privately commissioned portraits, still-lifes and landscapes, and never really retired. When he began to suffer from Alzheimer's disease in his early 80s, he&#xa0;found for a while that the symptoms could be alleviated by painting.</p> <p>He always welcomed admirers and recounted sometimes unlikely anecdotes with a painter's eye for the telling detail \u2013 the story of how he was once briefly mistaken for David Cassidy by an over-excited crowd of teenagers outside a TV studio was a particular favourite.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Liliana, son, George, and daughter, Susan.</p> <p>\u2022 Arnaldo Putzu, commercial artist, born 6&#xa0;August 1927; died 1 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>Dorothy Wedderburn, who has died aged 87, was a social scientist with interests that came to&#xa0;centre on industrial sociology. She was also a socialist, university principal, enemy of all self-advertisement and an untypical member of the community of \"the great and the good\".</p> <p>Born in Walthamstow, north-east London, she was the youngest child of&#xa0;Frederick Barnard, a class-conscious trade unionist carpenter and joiner, and his wife, Ethel, who had left school at 13 to earn her living in service. Both were the children of blacksmiths. Even in relatively meritocratic Britain, few 20th-century academics and administrators of distinction started life in such a working-class family. For both Dorothy and her brother George, an eventual president of the Royal Statistical Society, to graduate from Cambridge University before 1945 was yet more uncommon, though helped by&#xa0;school scholarships.</p> <p>From an evacuated Walthamstow high school for girls, Dorothy applied to Oxford and Cambridge and was offered a place at both. In 1943 she went to Girton College, Cambridge, where she could study economics, \"which I&#xa0;knew nothing about but which seemed relevant to my interests\".</p> <p>Like George, she soon joined the Communist party and remained a member until sometime in the mid- or late 1950s \u2013 she claimed not to remember exactly \u2013 but never announced her resignation or&#xa0;changed the basic pattern of her political activities. She remained steadily, if&#xa0;sometimes sceptically, loyal&#xa0;to the labour movement and the&#xa0;left.</p> <p>The prospects for academic careers were scant in those days, and Dorothy had not seriously thought of one when, married to an undergraduate contemporary, the economic historian AN \"Max\" Cole, she returned to Cambridge after a spell as temporary assistant principal, and then research officer, at the Board of Trade (1946-50). A perceptive economist suggested she should supervise undergraduates, and she joined Richard Stone's department of applied economics, where she stayed for the next 15 years as research officer, and later senior research officer. She never took a research degree.</p> <p>Her interests shifted from economics to social policy \u2013 on which she began to lecture at Cambridge \u2013 and, after work on poverty, redundancy and old age, with a number of books in the 1960s, to&#xa0;industrial sociology. She was awarded honorary doctorates by Cambridge and six other universities, and maintained her friendships and connections with Cambridge, particularly with Darwin College, to the end.</p> <p>In 1962, two years after her first marriage ended in divorce, Dorothy married the labour lawyer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/12/lord-wedderburn-of-charlton\" title=\"Lord Wedderburn of Charlton obituary\">Bill, later Lord, Wedderburn</a>. When he moved from Cambridge to a chair at the LSE, she considered but rejected a post there in favour of one in the engineering department at Imperial College London, with more scope for her interest in the influence of technology on work organisation. She rose from lecturer to professor of&#xa0;industrial sociology (1977-81) and head of the department of economic and social studies.</p> <p>As a member of \"the great and the good\", she chaired an inquiry into women's prisons and sat on research councils, on the Committee on the Pay and Conditions of Nurses, on the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth (strangled by the incoming prime minister, Margaret Thatcher), and on the council of&#xa0;Acas, the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service, which survived even the iron lady. Until 2004 she served on the board of the Anglo-German Foundation.</p> <p>Though indifferent to showmanship, Dorothy found herself to be an academic grandee \u2013 a member of&#xa0;advisory committees and governing bodies. In 1980 she was elected principal of&#xa0;Bedford College, University of&#xa0;London, retaining her link with Imperial as senior research fellow (1981-2003). She supervised the difficult but necessary merger of the oldest of British women's colleges with another Victorian foundation for female higher education into <a href=\"http://www.rhul.ac.uk/aboutus/ourhistory/home.aspx\" title=\"College history\">Royal Holloway and Bedford New College</a>, University of London in 1986. Six years later its name was shortened to Royal Holloway, University of London. She remained its principal until 1990, quietly refusing the title usually offered in&#xa0;such&#xa0;cases. But she did not disdain the honorary presidency of the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/\" title=\"Fawcett Society website\">Fawcett Society</a> (1986-2002), campaigning for gender equality.</p> <p>Why Labour governments made so little use of a social policy expert so deeply committed to the labour movement puzzled many. In the 1960s she may have been considered too radical. In the era of Tony Blair, Downing Street had no enthusiasm for politically unreliable academic intellectuals.</p> <p>Though she had more than one close partner, Dorothy did not remarry after her second divorce, in 1968. She acted as a matriarch of the Barnard clan, radiating intelligence, warmth and trust.</p> <p>Active holidays in Denmark, Wales and Norfolk became increasingly difficult. She bore strokes from 2006 and the loss of her sight in 2010 with grace and the help of family, loyal friends and music.</p> <p>A notably attractive woman, Dorothy continued to take her appearance seriously. At the lunch with which Royal Holloway celebrated her 80th birthday, she reserved a table for the staff of her Knightsbridge hairdressers. She never ceased to enjoy the recreations which she described in Who's Who as politics and cooking. For her survivors, her greatest gift was friendship.</p> <p>\u2022 Dorothy Enid Cole Wedderburn, sociologist, born 18 September 1925; died&#xa0;20 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>A Nigerian court has sentenced a 29-year-old actor to three months imprisonment under an archaic colonial law that deems sodomy an \"against the order of nature\", as the government seeks to tighten the existing legislation by introducing an anti-gay bill.</p> <p>Bestwood Chukwuemeka, a minor star in the local Nollywood film industry, pleaded guilty after a male friend he had sex with in his private home later reported him to the police.</p> <p>\"I was under the influence of alcohol and I want the court to temper justice with mercy,'' local media reported him saying.</p> <p>Nafisatu Buba, the sentencing magistrate at a court in the capital, Abuja, said the sentence would send a message to others. \"This would serve as warning to other youths who hide under the influence of alcohol to commit crimes,'' she said.</p> <p>Anal sex is illegal in Nigeria, and punishable by whipping or stoning in some states in the predominantly Muslim north which are also governed by sharia laws, although no stonings have been carried out to date.

  "<p>The first chief coroner of England and Wales has promised to establish a cadre of specialists to examine deaths in custody and military fatalities.</p> <p>In his inaugural address, Peter Thornton QC said he would use his new powers to intervene in cases that, he implied, became highly complex or controversial.</p> <p>The judge, who presided over the inquest last year into the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests in 2009, said the current coroners system suffered from \"a lack of consistency, a lack of leadership and a lack of guidance\".</p> <p>There has been severe criticism of the work of pathologists \u2013 particulary Dr Freddie Patel, who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/23/tomlinson-pathologist-freddy-patel-struck-off\" title=\"\">struck off</a> by the General Medical Council this summer \u2013 and the thoroughness with which inquests investigate deaths in custody.</p> <p>Thornton's appointment itself was the subject of intense political battles. The post was created by the last Labour administration, and abolished during the coalition government's so-called bonfire of the quangos. It was reinstated after lobbying by the Royal British Legion and the organisation Inquest, which supports families attending coroners' courts. During that process, the post lost the power to hear appeals against inquest decisions.</p> <p>Addressing the annual conference of the Coroners Society of England and Wales, Thornton said: \"I will have the power to step in and take over an investigation at any stage. I do not intend to do that frequently, only very occasionally. And I would prefer to do it by consent.\"</p> <p>The chief coroner has the authority to transfer a case to a named coroner with experience in specific investigations, a power rarely used by ministers. \"[I] will, I believe, be closer to the transfer process and will be able to influence a greater level of flexibility. That does not mean that I will want to intervene on a regular basis,\" Thornton said.</p> <p>Enhancing the role of experts was vital, he suggested. \"I am considering developing a number of specially trained coroner groups. The greater flexibility in the new act over coroner areas and the possible movement of coroners by way of an extended transfer system, coupled with new training, provides the opportunity to develop and apply specialist groups of coroners.</p> <p>\"The groups could include a cadre of specially trained service death coroners who, if necessary, would travel to the area of the next of kin to investigate and hold the inquest.\" Thornton said he had already begun to consult with the Ministry of Defence and the Royal British Legion.</p> <p>\"Another group could include coroners specialising in deaths in custody or even particular types of deaths in custody such as asphyxia from restraint.\" Deaths in prison or police stations involving suspects who have been held down have been been a recurrent challenge for the inquest system. Thornton stressed the importance of Rule 43 reports, which are designed to prevent further such fatalities.</p> <p>Deborah Coles, of Inquest, said: \"The whole coroners system has been so grossly neglected for the past hundred years, we hope we will now see a more accountable and meaningful system. He seems to be heading in the right direction. It's a proper recognition of the complexity of the law. The real challenge for the chief coroner is going to be a question of resources.\"</p> <p>Inquest is due to publish its own report next week on learning from deaths in custody and highlighting the importance of Rule 43 reports.</p>",
  "<p>The Premier League clubs will meet next week to discuss the imposition of some radical new cost control measures.</p> <p>Among the ideas up for debate is a proposal from Ellis Short, Sunderland's owner, that clubs should agree to limit any increases in player costs to a fixed sum, say 10%, for prearranged periods. The ensuing restrictions on wage rises would make it increasingly difficult for leading players and their agents to demand huge salary hikes mid-contract, thereby helping achieve the Premier League's aim of financial sustainability for all members. An alternative suggestion is that clubs should spend no more than 70% of their turnovers on wages.</p> <p>Another item on the agenda which will be discussed when the 10 southern clubs meet on Monday and their 10 northern counterparts convene on Wednesday is asking chief executives to supply the Premier League with five-year financial forecasts. At present the League receives one-year financial plans from all clubs but there is a feeling that, with player and managers sometimes joining on five-year deals, it is important that they demonstrate a longer term ability to guarantee such contracts.</p> <p>A third possibility is that all England's elite clubs may agree to adopt and abide by the \"break even\" element of Uefa's new financial fair play rules, which from 2014 will affect British clubs involved in European competition.</p> <p>With the recent salutary examples set by Portsmouth and Leeds serving as stark warnings, \"financial sustainability\" is increasingly heard in Premier League circles but persuading all 20 clubs to enforce such cost control stipulations and agree sanctions will prove tricky. Chelsea, Fulham and Manchester City are all opposed to the mooted restrictions and there will be much debating before concrete proposals are put to the vote.</p> <p>Even so there is a sense that the wind of financial change beginning to blow through English football will eventually become inexorable.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong> Good afternoon - we didn't OBO it but what I watched of Brendon McCullum's 58-ball 123 off Bangladesh this morning was as impressive an innings as I've seen him play. Obviously you have to put in the caveat that it was Bangladesh but it came on a pitch favouring the bowlers and against an attack with the type of left-arm spin that has put the brakes on him in the past. One of my colleagues said earlier today that he felt this tournament needs something seismic \u2013 an underdog win or a 36-run over. He's obviously been thinking about Stuart Broad who, of course, fits both bills , having been clouted by Yuvraj Singh in the inaugural tournament South Africa in 2007 and bowling the last over when the Netherlands squeezed past England in the opening game of the 2009 tournament. He could do without either today and does seem very calm and assured. I liked his answer to the inevitable KP question at the pre-match press conference. He was asked had he liked Pietersen's TV commentary so far. \"I've got this Formula One game at the minute. I'm a bit addicted to it, so I've not seen anything.\" It rather echoed Gordon Strachan's years ago: \"I've got more important things to think about. I've got a yoghurt to finish by today, the expiry date is today. That can be my priority rather than Agustin Delgado.\"</p> <p>As England know, you can't win the tournament during the phoney war but you can lose it and Afghanistan showed enough against India not to be written off as a threat. Shapoor Zadran looked very sharp indeed and the strangling job done by the spinners made the Indians take risks. Mangal and Nabi batted with confidence and flair in the chase. Bumble's already had a laugh at how podgy they are as a team and reckons England will be far too good for them. Logically, he's right. But we all know about logic and T20 games.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>It's Friday afternoon:</strong> Go to the pub.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Afghanistan have won the toss and put England in to bat</strong></p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>England XI:</strong> Kieswetter, Hales, Wright, Morgan, Buttler, Bairstow, Patel, Broad, Swann, Finn, Dernbach.</p> <p><strong>Afghanistan XI:</strong> Mohammad Shahzad, Nawroz Mangal, Karim Sadiq, Asghar Stanikzai, Mohammad Nabi, Samiullah Shenwarri, Shafiqullah, Izatulla Dwalatzai, Gulbodin Naib, Dawlat Zadran, Shapoor Zadran.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Is it really four years since Nick Knight was the Guardian's chief scout? </strong> Here he is, live and direct from the vault, on his two picks that summer in this team \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/20/middlesex.cricket\">Steven Finn</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/27/middlesex.cricket\">Eoin Morgan</a></p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Advertisers</strong> Enough with the Nouvelle Vague. It was old hat a decade ago. \"Just stuck a tenner on Afghanistan,\" writes Richard Clarke. \"That will brighten up my hung over afternoon.\" It means more when you've got money on it, Richard.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>The conundrum: </strong>\"Looking beyond this match,\" writes Robin Hazlehurst, \"what do England need to do to advance? Because everyone loves an underdog, right? And everyone loves Afghanistan (the cricket team at least), right? And Stuart Broad could probably do with being taken down a peg or two, so a shock Afghanistan victory here could actually be rather enjoyable even for the committed England fan. Except not if it kiboshes England's chance of staying in the tournament. So in short, is it OK for England to lose this without risking their participation - in which case come on the Afghans - or is it already a must-win match for England - in which case c'mon England? And how would a draw or a tie leave things?\" You nearly had me convinced there, Robin. No it's not OK for England to lose this match so let's not tie ourselves up in conscience knots. For those asking for an update on the OBOers contribution to Afghan cricket following the 2010 T20, here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/mar/21/afghanistan-cricket-pitch-guardian\">Andy Bull</a>.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>The Afghan anthem</strong> has stirred Marie Meyer and Peter Inglesby. Here it is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhHYmaPKk54\">again</a>. \"Just wanted to check that the use of the phrase 'Phoney war' is a cricketing metaphor and not a political comment, what with this being the Guardian and all that,\" says Phil Withall. \"Sorry I was going to be witty but I've just woken up on the sofa, the dog was licking my feet, it's midnight and I seem to have cricked my neck. Also are the Afghan national anthem and the champions league music in any way related? I was slightly confused for a moment \u2026\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Kieswetter b S Zadran 0</strong> Out off the last ball of the over, a wicket maiden, dragging on as he tried to take his bat off the perpendicular.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1st over England 0-1 (Wright 0, Hales 0)</strong> Shapoor Zadran opens the bowling, left-arm over and his first ball scares the life out of Kieswetter, not with its pace but by the pitch's lack of bounce as it dies and trickles through to the keeper off a shortish length. Kieswetter gets stuck. He often finds it difficult to get going. Needs a pre-match fluffer. He's out from the last ball of what turns into a wicket maiden, put in three minds by the pitch not having the bounce he's bargained for.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2nd over England 5-1 (Wright 0, Hales 5)</strong> Hales gets England off the mark with a thick edge off Dawlat Zadran. His first two balls are short, wide and swinging away. The four flew past slip and would have been bagged by an orthodox field. he has a nibble at the next, too. Scrambled brains all round as Hales gets off strike with a daft KPesque single to mid-off, giving the fielder three stumps to aim at and had he hit Hales would have been out by two yards. There's bounce at this end, though, Dawlat rapping Wright on the knuckles to finish the over.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3rd over England 10-1 (Wright 4, Hales 5)</strong> Shapoor Zadran bowls three dot balls in succession to start the over, his inky hair in the wind giving him a touch of the Shoaib Akhtar effect. Pitching up at last wide outside off he gives Wright room to open his arms and drive him square for four. Be careful for what you wish for, Robin?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>4th over England 17-1 (Wright 8, Hales 7)</strong> The Zadran boys are offering contrasting tests for the batsmen, Dawlat getting swing but then makes the error of dropping short and is turned round the corner for a single, drops even shorter and is punished with a pirouetting and powerful hook. When he pitches up he's looked very dangerous, especially as Wright is looking to drive him during the powerplay rather than settle for accumulating while the pitch has some zip (from this end). A request from Peter Collins to any Sarf Londoners: \"A couple of years ago I gave a lift to a very polite young man who claimed he was a member of the Afghan cricket team. He was somehow stranded in the car park by Morden Hall swimming pool, when he actually had to be at the Old Rutlishians sports ground in Merton Park - a good few miles away and near where I live. He was in a hurry and I never got to ask his name, but I wonder if any of the good folk reading OBO have any knowledge of Afghanis playing at that sports ground or was I either dreaming or being spun a yarn?\" Can anyone help?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>5th over England 38-1 (Wright 18, Hales 16)</strong> Shapoor Zadran pitches up and it rears up from a spot only a foot or so infront of the popping crease and hurtles over the keeper's head for four byes. So he goes shorter and Hales square cuts him for four. The shackles come off as Shapoor experiments, opting for a slowish attempted yorker that Hales turns off his pads. Fine leg dives but misses it and is given the glare by Shapoor. The fourth boundary comes off the fifth ball, a long hop off-driven on the up and then Wright middles the last ball miles up and back over the bowler's head for six.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>6th over England 52-1 (Wright 23, Hales 25)</strong> \"Eeek, is this my fault,\" writes Robin Hazlehurst. \"Hmm, OK, but... But maybe this is the best sort of English victory, a classic collapse-stylee scenario followed by a desperate dig to get out of the original hole and a backs-to-the-wall display of bowling dry to just save the match with the last ball. I'd prefer that sort of victory to the sort of slightly embarrassing one that NZ managed earlier, fantastic as McCullum was. And thank God we've not picked any leakily expensive bowlers and that we can always rely on KP in the middle order to rescue us. Eh? Oh.\" Written before the last over, Robin. Relax. Wright has just belted another four through point and Hales follows up by clubbing a length ball over mid-off and the next over mid-on for more boundaries.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>7th over England 56-1 (Wright 26, Hales 26)</strong> Shenwari the leggie comes on and is giving Hales some food for thought with his variations, the top-spinner zipping through that gives the batsman the hurry up and the stock ball ripping and gripping. \"Kevin who?\" asks Phil Withall \"(prepares to place left foot firmly in mouth)\". Hales can't pick him it seems, Wright doesn't have to bother as the last ball is so short Wright pivots and pulls through midwicket without risk.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>8th over England 60-1 (Wright 27, Hales 29)</strong> Sadiq continues and England change tack, looking to nurdle and run the fielders. Wright gets a leading edge to the one that skips on at him from the flightless off-spinner but the ball falls shy of cover's run. The brakes are back on with spin from both ends.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>9th over England 69-1 (Wright 34, Hales 31)</strong> Wright rides his luck with his edged drive against the spin supposed to go to wide mid on but ends up dropping over cover safe. He does pick up a boundary with a more orthodox on-drive but both batsmen have been disconcerted by the skiddiness the spinners are extracting from the pitch cramping their ability to get any power into their shots.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Hales run out 31</strong> Poor sod, he was run out backing up when Wright slapped a shorter straight ball back down the wicket and Sadiq turned it on to the stumps at the non-striker's end.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>10th over England 74-2 (Wright 38, Morgan 1)</strong> Looking back at the wicket it wasn't a deliberate deflection rather a fumbled stop with Hales a third of the way up the pitch. Enter Morgan and Ian Chappell advising the leg-spinner to tempt him to use the pull shot. Karim Sadiq comes round the wicket to Wright and he's not getting enough turn to get the lbw he wants for rapping Wright's pads. Not getting any turn in fact. He's Min Patel. \"Don't know about the Afghan bloke from Sunny South London, but we were put to the sword in Sutton a couple of years ago when a young Afghan lad smashed a ton off of 60 odd balls,\" writes Ian Burch. \"He'd been discovered by the opposition a couple of weeks before at a local pizza parlour where he was working behind the counter. A lovely surprise as normally you get approached by Aussies and Saffers in SW London when you're carrying a cricket bag on the way to a game, bloody pests.\" Saffers outnumber Aussies now in my small radius west London cricket circles, Ian.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>11th over England 79-2 (Wright 41, Morgan 3)</strong> Morgan manages a run a ball, using his feet to get down the track to Shenwari, and Wright, too, hops about a bit to try and throw the bowler off his line but Shenwari cleverly waits for him and restricts him to three singles off four balls.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>12th over England 84-2 (Wright 43, Morgan 4)</strong> A UK Subs song, Stranglehold, arrived in my head for the first time in more than 30 years at the beginning of this over from Mohammad Nabi. Round the wicket he comes to Morgan, changing line, pace and length, giving Morgan nothing to work with to get under the ball and go over the top so he sweeps and reverses to keep the score moving instead. Too much premeditation perhaps, in that when he comes down the wicket he has set off far too early so far.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>13th over England 99-2 (Wright 54, Morgan 8)</strong> Luke Wright moves from 43 to 50 off two balls, a steepling six over mid-on and a prodded single. He's batted very sensibly, manipulating the ball around the clock face then unleashing when the ball dips quickly and sits up from the spinners. He plays his ugliest shot to finish the over, a shovel over midwicket for four played on one knee. Effective shot but you wouldn't marry it.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>14th over England 105-2 (Wright 56, Morgan 12)</strong> Shenwari, who began his spell tormenting Alex Hales, ends with 0 for 33 off his four overs. Nabi's is a real ragbag of an over, slower balls, quick ones even lobbers that the batsmen can only turn into the offside. Someone was telling me the other day that in his younger days Mike Brearley was an effective donkey drop bowler, perhaps the last practitioner in first class cricket. Does anyone know anything more?</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>15th over England 109-2 (Wright 58, Morgan 13)</strong> Pace returns with Dawlat Zadran who Dernbachs his speeds and makes it supremely difficult for Wright to play proper shots. \"As I must, I squeezed in my engagement between the SA series and the ICC T20 tournament,\" writes Simon Brereton, hoping to yank the food out of my children's mouths by bypassing a paid announcement. \"I realise it's not a genuine OBO engagement, but the OBO was instrumental in bringing Suzy to relish cricket. And because it's cheaper to print it in the Guardian this way \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr and Mrs J McAnanama, of Staten Island, NY, have the pleasure to announce the engagement of their eldest daughter, Suzanne McAnanama to Simon Brereton, lately of New York, and heir to several thousand pennies</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>16th over England 131-2 (Wright 73, Morgan 20)</strong> Oh, hello. Morgan hits his first six with a towering hit over midwicket and then Wright hits a four and a six. The four was a gift after the fielder slipped when Wright swept, the six was bashed over mid-off. Poor Nabi had bowled well till now but another fielder lets him down when the ball bounces over his attempted stop at mid-on. Four more.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Morgan c Mangal b Dawlatzai 27</strong> Tame looking push,a ttempting to go over midwicket but he didn't connect properly and lobbed it up to the captain.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>17th over England 141-3 (Wright 75, Buttler 0)</strong> \"TMS keeps mentioning the dancing girls - as they usually do - but can we have a description from you please?\" asks John Starbuck who fancies me for involuntary redundancy I reckon. \"They might be very westernised in style, or maybe talent imported from elsewhere, or perhaps locals doing whatever are the ethnic SL dance moves. We should be told.\" It's a cross between the Hitman and Her and a Kula Shaker video with \"jolly\" lasses, John. Dwlatzai makes the mistake of delivering a no-nall to Morgan who smashes him over mid-off for six but falls shorter with his free hit which is still dropped. But his luck and technique do not survive the over.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>18th over England 155-3 (Wright 76, Buttler 11)</strong> Dawlatzai has just dropped an absolute dolly that would have got Buttler for a duck at point, juggling and flailing before grassing it on the dive. The over from Nabi had begun so promisingly, hitting Buttler in the grille as he tried to sweep then almost pulling off a planned legside stumping. Buttler looks as though such a scratchy start can't dent his confidence though and helped by some atrocious fielding recovers to smack a couple of fours.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Buttler lbw Dawlatzai 15</strong> Struck on the back leg when trying to pummel it square. Job done, though - 15 off seven balls.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>19th over England 187-4 (Wright 95, Bairstow 7)</strong> Yeoman Buttler stands up and cracks Dawlatzai's first short ball, and it races to the midwicket boundary. Off he goes and Dawlatzai gives Bairstow a no-ball as an \"Ahoy hoy\" which he smacks for six. Another no ball off the free hit so they take a single and Wright has a chance off the second free hit. Wright is caught on the mid-on boundary off that and a comedy of errors ends with the fielder touching the boundary board with his heel. Six more. Nineteen off three legitimate balls. Make that 25 off four with Wright feasting on a full-length straight one with a flat straight six. Thirty-one off five \u2013 on-drive from a ball pitched up and on middle and off. Terrible bowling. His head's gone. Only one off the last as Dawlatzai in the end learns that you can't give Wright or Bairstow room to have a heave. <strong>Wright's is now England's highest ever World T20 international innings. </strong></p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Bairstow c S Zadran b D Zadran 12</strong> A Sidebottom special slower short one traps Bairstow \u2013 he pulls too soon and sends it down mid-on's throat.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>20th over England 196-5 (Wright 99, Patel 0)</strong> So Dawlatzai ends with two for 56 off three overs. Dawlat Zadran, the pick of the bowlers, returns for the last one and Bairstow smacks him past the undefended midwicket rope for four then Bairstow Bolts it to make tow from a push to cover to give Wright a chance of a century. Zadran arrows the ball into his ankles and he has to make do with one. Two balls left. Bairstow is out but they cross giving Wright three to get off the last ball but he falls two short. Excellent knock from Wright. From 0 for 1 off one over to 196-5</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Innings break </strong>\u2013 yes I'm aware the words \"World T20\" were missing from the statement about Wright's highest ever innings. Sorry I was typing too fast off a 32-run over to read it back before publishing. Apologies.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Interval email:</strong> \"When Arjuna Ranatunga decided to improve Sri Lankan cricket, he worked his team (if not himself) first on the fielding because he knew they could match he world in that discipline if not cricket's other two,\" writes Gary Naylor. \"Yet, such is the standard of Twenty20 led fielding these days, that a bit of trundling with the ball and biffing with the bat is a lot easier to produce amongst an XI than the astonishing feats we take for granted in the field. Baseball will be copying cricket soon.\" Ha. The sad thing is, Afghanistan did so much so well. A Randall, Paul Parker and Graham Barlow and they' would never have conceded so many runs. </p> <p>Wright, who looked upset as he walked off but recovered his equanimity in time for his interview, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=11;filter=advanced;orderby=start;outs=0;runsmax1=99;runsmin1=99;runsval1=runs;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">is the 18th man to make 99 not out in international cricket</a> \u2013 all since 1979, oddly \u2013 and the third Englishman.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Shahzad c Broad b Finn1</strong> Finn ties him down then throws him one that looks appetising but he gets underneath it and knocks it straight down mid-off's throat.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Shafiqullah c Sub (Bopara) b Dernbach 0</strong> Sliced his cut shot up in the air to the substitute Bopara at point. Golden duck. Two for two.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>1st over: Afghanistan 2-1 (Shafiqullah 0, Mangal 1) chasing 197</strong> Finn bowls the first over with two slips in and at 85mph. Shahzad almost runs himself out then obliges off the last ball of the over.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Afghanistan 4-2 (K Sadiq 2, Mangal 1) chasing 197</strong> Dernbach isn't bothering with his variations yet, going for some enforcement with pace and a short of a length line, foxing Shafiqullah then clattering Sadiq's helmet to welcome him to the crease. Dernbachs saves his slow ball for the end and Sadiq has time to recover and jab his bat down on it. He got off the mark with a shot straight out of the Darrowby v Rainby match in one of the James Herriott books.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Afghanistan 12-2 (K Sadiq 2, Mangal 6) chasing 197</strong> Mangal cashes in from the PP regulations by flat batting a cross bat hoick wide of Patel at mid-on for four. Finn then appeals for a catch down the legside off the batsman's glove but the umpire signals a wide instead. There was a hint that it might have feathered the bony bit infront of the wrist but nothing convincing.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Mangal c&amp;b Broad 8</strong> Oh dear. This is a cakewalk. Don't want to get all Cpl Jones and don't like it up them, but their timing off fast short-pithed bowling is woeful, another spliced cross-bat shot his downfall. Excellent catch from Broad who must have thought it was flying past mid-on at least but it took an age to get to the bowler who was in his followthrough.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4th over: Afghanistan 17-3 (K Sadiq 2, Stanikzai 3) chasing 197</strong> They can take singles and the odd two when Broad or anyone pitches up but the short ball is causing havoc.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>5th over: Afghanistan 22-3 (K Sadiq 5, Stanikzai 4) chasing 197</strong> Runs for Sadiq with a graceful whipt hrough midwicket when Finn knees the stumps over but his shot from the shorter ball is as confused as his team-mates', thick-edging it just beyond Bairstow sprinting across at third man for the catch. He does stop the boundary though.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Karim Sadiq run out 5</strong> Huge credit to England for imposing such pressure with bat, ball and fielding but Afghanistan are accomplices. Buttler's wonderful stop at square leg should have stopped the run before his throw demolished the stumps with the batsmen committed.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Stanikzai c Bairstow b Broad 4</strong> Andrew Hilditched another bouncer and top-edged it to fine leg where Bairstow scooped it an inch off the turf with a fine run and dive. Have you ever seen a better wicketkeeper in the outfield?</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>6th over: Afghanistan 22-5 (Shenwari 0, Nabi 0) chasing 197</strong> Has anyone seen Bumble's lost pants? He's had to buy spares in Colombo according to Nasser Hussain. Perhaps the Afghan players have nabbed them given their startled rabbit response to England's line of attack.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>7th over: Afghanistan 25-5 (Shenwari 2, Nabi 1) chasing 197</strong> \"It seems Stuart Broad is going for the full beard in this tournament, just like they used to on tour, back in the day. If they last the distance, he should make a respectable set. How come the BLF hasn't remarked on this yet?\" Because the Flett signal has not been sent from Guardian Towers. It has now, though, John. Samit Patel comes into the attack and Sourav Ganguly is a fan of the balance he brings to the side. Three singles come off the over.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Shenwari c Finn b Swann 2</strong> One hopes that this shellacking does not demoralise the Afghan players. They bowled well, Shenwari in particular at the beginning of his spell. But the batting. Hell. Shenwari was unlucky in that his reverse sweep was pretty well executed off Swann given the drift and turn but he could not have hit it any closer to the fielder had it been iron/cobalt/nickel (and definitely not copper only a fool who did Latin and Greek instead of chemistry and biology would be so dumb to write such a thing) and Finn had been equipped with a magnet.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Nabi b Patel 1</strong> Danced down the wicket and missed a straight one that clipped middle and leg. Dreadful shot.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>8th over: Afghanistan 25-6 (Naib 0, Nabi 1) chasing 197</strong> I'm losing overs here between the wickets.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! D Zadran st Kieswetter b Patel 0</strong> This is embarrassing now. Same shot as Nabi, he threw his head up high, set off down the track and missed it by six inches. He's a tailender, of course, and was beaten by the flight but it was a bloodrush of a shot.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>9th over: Afghanistan 26-8 (Naib 1, S Zadran 0) chasing 197</strong> Two wickets for Samit who is bowling well but whether he would have anything against players with more resistance is debatable.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>10th over: Afghanistan 26-8 (Naib 1, S Zadran 0) chasing 197</strong> Maiden from Swann, who is using his height to pin the batsman back on his crease.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>11th over: Afghanistan 28-8 (Naib 1, S Zadran 2) chasing 197</strong> Good shot from Shapoor Zadran to midwicket. He's got fast hands, Harry. He took two and we had to wait for a while to see if Jos Buttler touched the boundary board but he managed to let go before his foot clipped the rope.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>12th over: Afghanistan 44-8 (Naib 17, S Zadran 2) chasing 197</strong> Swann begins his third over and concedes his first run of the spell off his thirteenth ball when Naib decides to have a dart over the bowler's head then repeats to midwicket. He likes hitting with the spin, sweeping for two then bombarding cow corner with a six. Excellent. Time for a quick.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>13th over: Afghanistan 45-8 (Naib 17, S Zadran 2) chasing 197</strong> England are going to give Luke Wright a rare bowl instead of the chin music. He likes to bowl those Mark Ealham short ones that move away from the left-hander and Zadran has a fish at one and a swerve away from the other. \"Copper is not repeat not attracted to or by magnets,\" writes Bernard Cohen. Damn chemistry. Should. Have. Paid. More. Attention.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>14th over: Afghanistan 50-8 (Naib 22, S Zadran 2) chasing 197</strong> Broad brings himself on and Naib edges him for four. Broad paints on a smile. More a crocodile smile than a rueful one. \"Aha,\" writes Paul Ilechko. \"That's your problem, then. Magnetism is physics, not chemistry.\" I was in the scholarship form, Paul. I know not of this \"physics\" of which you speak.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>15th over: Afghanistan 64-8 (Naib 35, S Zadran 3) chasing 197</strong> Dernbach comes back into the attack after bowling only one over so far, Naib not reading his slower ball and toeing it to up just short of Bairstow running in from long on. A lovely slow one out of the back of the hand bamboozles Naib but not the next which he smears for a six over mid-off. He's having it and follows it by taking his front foot towards midwicket and cross-batting it to deep midwicket for six more. \"Copper isn't magnetic unless it's got a current flowing through it,\" writes Ant Pease. \"I merely took it for granted that was what you meant, safe in the knowledge that a Guardian journalist wouldn't either make a basic mistake or try to patronise their readers.\" Yes. Both those things. You know me so well.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! S Zadran lbw Swann 9 </strong> Zadran had just belted him for six then pushed the next ball through quicker and caught the batsman on the crease with the one that went on straight.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>16th over: Afghanistan 70-9 (Naib 35, Dwlatzai 0) chasing 197</strong> Shapoor Zadran departs after going down on one knee to clear the long grass boundary at deep midwicket.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>17th over: Afghanistan 79-9 (Naib 43, Dwlatzai 0) chasing 197</strong> Naib is having fun and doing an even better job in restoring some pride, middling a four off Finn that rifles past Bairstow's dive at long on then smacking a full bunger straight on the ground to the Yorkshireman and turning down the single. It seems he wants to bat out the overs, the first of his team-mates with long-term ambition in this innings. \"Magnetism is physics?\" splutters Phil Sawyer. \"I thought it was a superpower. Mind you, I did spend a lot of my school days buried in X-Men comics when I should have been learning stuff.\" Ha. Naib plays the most astonishing shot from Finn's fifth ball, taking a huge stride outside off before the ball had been delivered, and turning it to the square leg boundary.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Naib c Morgan b Dernbach 44</strong> Dernbach's leg-spinner catches the bottom of Naib's bat as he tries to find cow corner again and spoons up on the offside. Morgan calls for the catch and takes it easily.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>England win by 116 runs</strong> A clinical bowling performance followed a fine innings from Wright and strong contributions and cameos from Hales, Morgan, Buttler and Bairstow.

The vast majority of the world's 1.5 billion Muslims expressed their disgust and dismay through peaceful, legitimate means.</p> <p>This situation challenges all rational and responsible people not to respond to malicious provocation with violence. Likewise, it challenges us to isolate all forms of extremism, whether in the west or in Muslim lands. This is a task for thinkers, civil societies and opinion makers on both sides as much as it is for politicians. The colonial and postcolonial eras have been marked by mutual mistrust: we need a real change in policies as well as mutual respect and a genuine dialogue.</p> <p>The revolution that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/19/peter-beaumont-libya-intervention-gaddafi\" title=\"\">overthrew the Gaddafi regime</a> was an armed revolution and a war. The Libyan people sacrificed the lives of tens of thousands in order to attain their freedom. What we witness today in Libya is a difficult transitional phase: the state is virtually absent, and there is a proliferation of weapons, especially among the young.</p> <p>Libyan cities are generally safe, but that does not preclude the breakdown of security from time to time. The painful incident in Benghazi can be attributed, at least in part, to the weakness of the state, which the Gaddafi regime destroyed over the course of its 42-year rule. But Libyan society will not surrender to the chaos of weapons. The success of the last free elections is the greatest proof of Libya's steady trajectory toward democracy.</p> <p>Today, we see the workings of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19204111\" title=\"\">first elected parliament in the history of Libya</a>. We see all the political forces sitting in the same room, agreeing and disagreeing, but within the framework of a democracy. We have just witnessed a serious but transparent competition to elect the prime minister, with clear and distinct options. The successful candidate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/13/libyan-pm-regional-militias\" title=\"\">Mustafa Abu Shagour</a>, will form the first elected government since the revolution: it is expected to be a coalition incorporating many political trends.</p> <p>At the same time \u2013 and on a daily basis \u2013 we also witness groups of the very revolutionaries who toppled Gaddafi surrendering their weapons to the state and returning to civilian life.</p> <p>True, Libyans are coming face to face with many difficulties as they seek to transform their society. But just as they did not surrender to the Gaddafi regime, they will not surrender now. They will continue to march steadfastly toward democracy and civil peace and reconciliation.</p> <p>Therefore, it is unwise for the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/14/libya-attacks-us-drones_n_1884058.html\" title=\"\">US to send drones into Libyan airspace</a> or naval destroyers to its shores: such steps will only increase tensions. Drones are not only provocative and illegal in international law but have also led to the killing of many innocent civilians in other countries that has had a serious impact on how the US is perceived in the region. Libya's sovereignty must be respected, in spite of what has happened. There should be trust in the Libyan justice system and their ability to pursue and prosecute the criminals. The Libyan government has already taken action and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19617175\" title=\"\">arrested suspects</a>.</p> <p>What is needed from the international community at this critical juncture is assistance to help Libya achieve stability and complete its transition to democracy without any intervention in internal Libyan affairs. Any such intervention can only complicate the situation.</p>",
  "<p>Rudeness is back in the news today. When is it ever absent, you may well ask, when Russell Brand still stalks the airwaves or our courts are obliged to discuss whether a footballer's stream of public abuse of a rival player breaks the law, not because it is foul-mouthed and offensive, but because a racial epithet may be attached? Rudeness about Islam is an inflammatory topic \u2013 literally so \u2013 again this autumn.</p> <p>By comparison with riots over American films and French magazines, today's domestic excitement is mild and not all the news is bad. Andrew Mitchell, the government chief whip, is accused \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4549265/Andrew-Mitchell-insults-police-at-Downing-Street-by-calling-them-fing-plebs.html\" title=\"\">by the Sun</a>, no less \u2013 of being rude to Downing Street police officers who told him he couldn't ride his bike through the big double gates into Whitehall but would have to use the pedestrian side gate like everyone else in the biking community.</p> <p>I'm slightly torn on this one. I try not to believe what I (rarely) read in the Sun unless it's strictly necessary. Last week's Hillsborough expos\u00e9 has reopened some fading wounds and uncharitable thoughts about its operational habits in the Murdoch era, though I accept Ofcom's verdict that they don't behave that way at BSkyB. Being accused of rudeness by the Sun is like being accused of egotism by Edwina Currie.</p> <p>There again, I know that smoothie, Andrew Mitchell. He can be charming, but also a bit snooty and rude. I can well imagine him saying something along the lines reported by the Sun. Was it just gossip which the paper picked up? Or did annoyed coppers shop the chief whip to teach him good manners, the more so because the incident took place just a day after the double police murder in Manchester?</p> <p>Perhaps. That sort of thing happens in these less than deferential times, but even in the days of steep social hierarchy the better sort of toff was not supposed to abuse their social inferiors in such coarse terms. In what nostalgics call the good old days it wasn't remote like Downton Abbey where most of the Crawley family's time seems to be taken up with worrying about the staff.</p> <p>But putting on a decent show did not include effing and blinding at police officers or (denied) calling them \"plebs\". In the good old days the coppers might have quietly punctured Mitchell's tyres or, worse, breathalysed him biking home. In the Flanders trenches of 1914-18 they might just have shot him.</p> <p>The better overnight news is that Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions (DPP), said this week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/dpp-prosecutions-facebook-twitter-abuse\" title=\"\">offensive tweets on social media should not attract prosecution unless</a> they can be shown to be part of \"a sustained campaign of harassment\" \u2013 the kind of nastiness which causes persistent distress and occasionally drives people to suicide.</p> <p>Good for Keir Starmer. In launching a consultation on how best to proceed in our new world of instant and often horribly inaccurate social media here's part of what he said:</p> <blockquote> \"Access to social media is ubiquitous and instantaneous. Banter, jokes and offensive comment are commonplace and often spontaneous. Communications intended for a few may reach millions. <br>\"Against that background, the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] has the task of balancing the fundamental right of free speech and the need to prosecute serious wrongdoing on a case by case basis. That often involves very difficult judgment calls and, in the largely uncharted territory of social media, the CPS is proceeding on a case by case basis.\" </blockquote> <p>Free speech, eh? What will they think of next? He's right and he's also right that it's not easy when the police, over-stretched in so many ways already, are now dealing with 14,000 such cases a year. Elsewhere in today's papers we learned that the internet troll who abused the diver Tom Daley and his diving partner, Peter Waterfield, after they failed to win Olympic medals. It had been a misguided attempt at humour and a one-off, meant for limited circulation, the CPS decided.</p> <p>Yet the person who set up a Facebook site to celebrate the alleged murderer of the two Manchester police officers was arrested this week under the Communications Act 2003. Putting aside the personal feelings of the arresting officers I think we can follow the logic of that, can't we. A website is a much more positive act that a tweet, its offence calculated and sustained.</p> <p>But it's tricky territory in which all of us are sometimes confused and contradictory.</p> <p>To take one obvious example on my working patch, many voters dislike the slanging match they witness at PMQs \u2013 but some of the same people hate it even more when they see the political class in constructive agreement. That's cosying up, we don't like that. Ditto Nick Clegg's now-famous apology \u2013 at this rate It will be a West End musical by Christmas \u2013 which attracted vituperation out of all proportion to its merit. I thought we wanted our elected leaders to own up to error?</p> <p>Women columnists have long complained about the violent and misogynistic tone of comments made below the line in what is an overwhelmingly male (and safely anonymous) world of tweeting and trolling. But it's far wider than that and hard to escape the suspicion that the liberating possibilities of the internet unleash demons as well as the wholesome decency anyone of us can find if we make a Google search for jam-making, medical advice or beekeeping.</p> <p>It matters because \u2013 so the BBC's Justin Webb was reporting on the Today programme from Florida \u2013 the temper of many Romney-Obama partisans in US presidential elections is getting even uglier and lies circulated online are hard to monitor or expose. I'm making a judgment here about Andrew Mitchell's clash with the coppers and conclude he was indeed probably rude to them. But I could be wrong \u2026</p> <p>Overshadowing most such debates about our wired world is Islam and the hyper-sensitivity of some Muslims to slights, real or imaginary, justified or merely abusive, on their faith and its founder. It's all far worse than it was in 1989 when the Iranian fatwa was issued against Salman Rushdie over his impenetrable novel The Satanic Verses. Hearing him promote his memoirs this week is to be reminded what an irritating fellow Rushdie can be, the Edwina Currie of literature.</p> <p>But the British taxpayer was right to protect him, even though he has been characteristically ungrateful. Would we be so brave today? I hope so but Channel 4's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/11/channel-4-cancels-screening-islam\" title=\"\">recent cancellation</a> of historian Tom Holland's film on the historic \u2013 as distinct from theological \u2013 origins of Islam is one of many straws in the hurricane which suggest otherwise. Holland is not some ignorant American crazy with a grudge.</p> <p>Islam is a religion undergoing the enormous strains of belated modernisation which we must hope will eventually deliver it to a better place. So I have some sympathy. As an American judge once observed no one's free speech gives them the right to shout \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre. The law exists to protect cinema-goers from such dangerous irresponsibility and Muslims \u2013 or police officers - from incitement.</p> <p>And, as with internet trolls, chief whips too for that matter, manners and taste should also act as restraints. But the argument cuts both ways. The absence of free speech and rigorous intellectual inquiry during the declining centuries of Islam \u2013 the Ottoman empire banned the new-fangled printing press \u2013 contributed to its decline, just as the onslaught by Christian fundamentalists on American science will do there unless it is checked.</p> <p>Free speech under the law is fundamental. Now Keir Starmer, tell us exactly what the law says.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney faced a fresh setback Friday at the end of his worst week since the presidential campaign when newly released figures showed he has come off second-best to Barack Obama in an area the Republicans had expected to be dominant: fundraising.</p> <p>The Obama campaign team, after a series of frantic appeals for funds from small donors throughout the summer, has $88m on hand to spend on ads and campaign staff in the coming weeks. Romney has $50m but that includes $15m he has to repay on a loan, leaving him with $35m.</p> <p>So far this campaign, Obama has raised $774m, giving him an edge over Romney, whose supporters have raised $736m.</p> <p>The Romney strategy for winning the White House was based largely on a promise that he would outspend Obama by about two to one in the biggest ad blitz America has ever seen in the final months of the campaign. But, in spite of his personal wealth and the support of billionaires, that strategy appears to be going up in smoke.</p> <p>Although the election is still a month and a half away, some senior Republicans are already beginning to write off their hopes of retaking the White House unless there is some major international event, such as a Middle East crisis that pushes up the price of petrol, or some bad economic news or a major gaffe by Obama.</p> <p>Former Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan, in an comment piece in the Wall Street Journal on Friday, voiced the criticism many Republicans have been making in private and joined calls for a change at the top of the campaign team.</p> <p>It was the second time this week that Noonan has been critical. Referring to her earlier piece about the campaign, she wrote: \"This week I called it incompetent, but only because I was being polite. I really meant rolling calamity.\"</p> <p>Romney's wife, Ann, offered a rare glimpse of the growing sense of frustration inside the camp in the face of such criticism. In an interview with Radio Iowa, she told critics: \"Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it? Get in the ring.\"</p> <p>It was not a helpful intervention, only adding to the sense of disarray.<br>Obama is ahead in the polls both nationally and in almost all the seven swing states that will decide the election: Florida, Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada. One poll had Obama ahead of Romney by 5% in Colorado and 8% in Iowa.</p> <p>Romney embarked on a new strategy Friday, his second campaign re-launch in the space of five days. The first relaunch on Monday, announced by one of his strategists, Ed Gillespie, promised Romney would become more specific about what policies he would pursue in office rather than the negative approach of concentrating almost solely on attacking Obama's record.</p> <p>That strategy lasted little more than a few hours until Romney, in the biggest setback to his campaign yet, was confronted with a devastating secret video of his speech to a small, $50,000-a-place dinner for Republican donors in Florida in which he characterised 47% of the American population as freeloaders, dependent on federal government help. </p> <p>At a 12,000-strong campaign rally on Friday in Virginia \u2013 a key battleground state \u2013 Obama stepped up his attack on Romney's 47% remark. \"I don't see a lot of victims in this crowd today. I see a lot of hard working Virginians,\" he told the crowd in Woodbridge.</p> <p>As part of the new-look strategy, Romney, who, unusually for a candidate at this stage in the election cycle, has been largely absent from the campaign trail over the last two weeks, is visiting the swing states where his hoping to address large rallies and stick to a scripted speech rather than the off-the-cuff remarks that have landed him in trouble.</p> <p>The Democratic party is warning against complacency, stressing that there are still weeks of campaigning left, including three presidential debates, the first on 3 October. Early voting begins in some states next week.</p> <p>Former president Bill Clinton, who provided the star turn at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, this month, warned that while Romney will have to do a lot of explaining about what he meant about his 47% comment, Democrats should not believe that gaffe amounts to a knock-out punch.</p> <p>He told CNN: \"I still think you have to assume it's going to be a close race, assume it's a hard fight and then fight through it. But I think the president has the advantage now. We did have a very good convention. He got a good boost out of it.\"</p> <p>The Clinton call for caution was reinforced when Obama, in an interview with Latinos, said that \"change\", the slogan on which he campaigned on in 2008, could not come from inside Washington but outside.</p> <p>Romney is to push this line during a tour this weekend of Ohio and Colorado, saying he cannot believe the president who won on a slogan of \"Yes we can\" was now saying he could not implement change from inside Washington.</p> <p>The details of fundraising for August, released on Thursday night as required by law, show that Obama's coffers were boosted mainly by small donors.<br>Obama's campaign team, separate from the Democratic effort, raised $85m compared with Romney's $67m.</p> <p>Obama's campaign, combined with a separate fundraising efforts by the Democratic party, raised $114m to Romney's and the Republican party's $111.6m.</p> <p>The Obama Super Pac Priorities USA also out-raised for the first time this year its conservative counterpart Restore Our Future. Priorities was helped by big individual donors such as billionaire hedge manager Jim Simons who gave $2m.</p> <p>According to the figures submitted to the federal election commission, Obama's campaign spent more than $83m in August and Romney $66m.</p>",
  "<p>A judge who criticised UK abortion policies while sentencing a woman to eight years in prison for performing her own abortion at a late stage in her pregnancy is one of at least five members of the judiciary with links to a Christian charity which has campaigned for more conservative abortion laws.</p> <p>There has been surprise at the severity of the sentence Justice Jeremy Cooke imposed on Sarah Catt, who took a drug when she was 39 weeks pregnant to cause an early delivery and pleaded guilty in July to administering a poison with intent to procure a miscarriage.

It states that one of its objectives is \"applying God's justice on the ground\".</p> <p>The most senior member of the judiciary in the LCF, the influential high court judge Mark Hedley, is widely respected by peers \u2013 as is Cooke \u2013 but has admitted it can be difficult to square his beliefs with work as a judge.</p> <p>\"One of the difficulties of being a Christian within the law is that you're administering a system which doesn't claim to be Christian and the standards which law expects of people are often much less and rather different from the standards that Christians expect of themselves,\" <a href=\"http://www.request.org.uk/reflections/people/hedley/hedley_conflicts.htm\" title=\"\">he says in an interview</a> for a religious education website.</p> <p>\"So that does lead to conflicts from time to time but at the end of the day we have to accept that we are put in a society and we have to live in the society in which God has placed us and we all have to play our roles in ensuring that that society works.\"</p> <p>A number of other judges are associated with the LCF. They include a number of circuit court judges: John Stuart Colyer (now retired), who is listed in Who's Who as a vice-president from 1993, David Richardson, who has addressed annual conferences of the LCF's Student and Young Lawyers' (SYL) section, and Peter Collier. Asked how many judges were members of the LCF, and who they were, the fellowship responded by saying that it would be in breach of the Data Protection Act if it named members.</p> <p>But while there is no suggestion that lawyers and judges associated with the LCF have been anything other than professional in their work, there has been unease among secular campaigners about its role.</p> <p>Terry Sanderson, the president of the National Secular Society, said: \"The Lawyers' Christian Fellowship appears to have a large number of influential legal representatives among its members. It purports simply to promote Christian fellowship among them, but one of its stated primary objectives is 'applying God's justice on the ground'. What does that mean when it comes to judges? Does it mean that 'God's law' \u2013 whatever that might be \u2013 will trump for them the democratically agreed laws of this country?</p> <p>\"There is nothing wrong with a judge being a Christian, but that is a very different thing to being a 'Christian judge' who wants to apply biblical principles to judgments when those principles might not accord with the civil law that he or she is charged to uphold.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/features/a-matter-faith\" title=\"\">In another interview</a>, Hedley was said to be keen not to overplay the distinctiveness of being a Christian in the law, stating that a Christian and a humanist judge would reach the same conclusion in the vast majority of cases.</p> <p>In practice, secularists have been among those who have admired his handling of highly emotive cases, notably that of a severely brain-damaged baby boy who Hedley ruled could be allowed to die even though his devoutly religious parents wanted him to be kept on a life-support system.</p> <p>On another occasion, there was approval in the rightwing press and among Christian campaigners for his comments in a case in which a gay man and his lover took the lesbian mother of his children and her partner to court for access rights. The judge reportedly expressed frustration at the \"lack of sufficient vocabulary to explain the true nature of the relationships\" and said the case \"provides a vivid illustration of just how wrong these arrangements can go\".</p> <p>Asked about suggestions that there could be a conflict of interest in cases such as the one involving Cooke, the LCF said: \"The only membership requirement for the Lawyers' Christian Fellowship is agreement with its broad basis of faith. On issues outside the basis of faith members may, but do not necessarily, have the same views as the leadership of the organisation. There is no conflict between membership of the LCF and judicial office.\"</p> <p>The Judicial Communications Office, which represents judges in England and Wales, said Cooke had no further comment to make on his sentencing remarks.</p> <p>The official Guide to Judicial Conduct, issued by the Judges' Council of England and Wales, states that judges' active involvement in community groups such as educational, charitable and religious organisations \"is not necessarily inappropriate and may confer a public benefit\". But it adds that \"care should be taken that it does not compromise judicial independence or put at risk the status or integrity of judicial office\".</p> <p>A persistent area of controversy is the relationship between the LCF and a socially conservative campaign group, <a href=\"http://www.christianconcern.com/\" title=\"\">Christian Concern</a>, which other evangelical Christians increasingly regard as extreme.</p> <p>Christian Concern, which encompasses the Christian Legal Centre, was established in 2008 by Andrea Williams, the LCF's former director of public policy, who reportedly said it was done <a href=\"http://www.e-n.org.uk/p-4591-The-Christians-advocate.htm\" title=\"\">\"so as not to jeopardise the charitable status of the LCF\"</a>.</p> <p>The fellowship's website retains a link to Christian Concern, which has been at the forefront of some of the most high-profile campaigns on issues including abortion and gay rights. It also seeks to provide \"a Christian response\" to what it describes as the growing influence of radical Islam in the UK, which it says \"has great repercussions for all of us\".</p> <p>In May, the Law Society cancelled a booking for a conference organised by Christian Concern and a US conservative group that was set to debate gay marriage at the Law Society's London headquarters</p> <p>Sir Paul Coleridge, the family division judge who recently launched a new charity to combat marital break-up, was to be among the main speakers, but the event was called off after the Law Society ruled that the programme reflected \"an ethos which is opposed to same-sex marriage\".</p> <p>Christian Concern's activities have included helping to organise a 2010 conference where speakers promoted \"therapy\" for gay and bisexual people and last year was heavily involved in a campaign that led to peers voting by five votes to amend the equality bill, giving faith groups legal opt-outs that effectively allowed them to refuse to employ gay, bisexual and transgender people.</p> <p>It advertised earlier this month for a communications manager and a fundraising manager who would \"develop relationships with churches, major donors and be responsible for developing and promoting individual regular giving and direct marketing activities\".</p> <p>Asked to clarify the nature of its relationship with the Christian Legal Centre, the LCF said: \"The LCF is a completely separate organisation from the Christian Legal Centre. It provides no funding and is not involved with it. Our website has links to a number of different organisations. The LCF website makes it clear that it has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites for which it has hyperlinks.\"</p>",
  "<p>News Corp shareholders have reacted angrily to news that James Murdoch could soon run the media giant's flagship Fox TV channel.</p> <p>The son of News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch was heavily criticised on Thursday by British regulators over his role in the hacking scandal. On the same day, news broke he may soon be given control of some of the media firm's most high profile assets.</p> <p>One dissident shareholder called the news a \"slap in the face for shareholders, not to mention victims of the hacking scandal\".</p> <p>Murdoch is reportedly set to take over the running of Fox Networks, News Corp's US TV business that includes its national Fox channel, home to American Idol and The Simpsons, and cable businesses including FX.</p> <p>The news, first reported by the Financial Times, came the same day that British regulator Ofcom issued a report that took Murdoch to task over his role in the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>James Murdoch was head of News Corp's UK newspaper business as the hacking scandal broke. The regulator concluded he \"repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman\" and that his lack of action in was \"difficult to comprehend and ill-judged\".</p> <p>But in a ruling that handed a major victory to James' father Rupert Murdoch, Ofcom ruled that BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster whose largest shareholder is News Corp, remains a fit and proper owner of broadcast licences.</p> <p>News Corp declined to comment on the reports of James Murdoch's role at US operations.</p> <p>Julie Tanner, director of socially responsible investing for New York-based Christian Brothers Investment Services, said: \"This move proves that Rupert Murdoch is running News Corp solely for the benefit of the Murdoch family.\"</p> <p>Last year Tanner led a shareholder revolt that ended with the majority of independent shareholders voting against the re-election of James Murdoch, his brother Lachlan and most of the News Corp board. She has lodged a similar resolution ahead of this year's meeting.</p> <p>\"While we are disappointed \u2013 and frankly, somewhat amazed \u2013 by this move, I also hope it sheds light on the importance of voting for our resolution to appoint an Independent Chair at the New Corp AGM. This is a clear example of the need for improved corporate governance at the company,\" she said.</p> <p>The promotion would come as News Corp continues to face legal investigations into the phone-hacking scandal on both sides of the Atlantic. The justice department is investigating News Corp under the foreign corrupt practices act (FCPA), a statute that prosecutes US firms found guilty of bribing foreign officials.</p> <p>Some 50 people have so far been arrested in the UK over the scandal, including two journalists at The Sun newspaper and a policeman arrested this week during an ongoing bribery investigation.</p> <p>James Murdoch resigned as chairman of News International, the media group's UK newspaper business, in February and from BSkyB in April. He relocated to the US and has so far kept a lower profile. But his elevation would likely to trigger a new round of criticism from shareholders and pressure groups.</p> <p>In August lobby group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) filed a complaint with the broadcast regulator the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) arguing News Corp was unfit to run US broadcasting licenses.</p> <p>Crew executive director Melanie Sloan said the possible elevation of James Murdoch would strengthen their case. \"It seems to me that there is a lot more to come out about James Murdoch. There are plenty more questions that need answers,\" she said.</p>",

Centrica's potential departure could have something to do with the economics of nuclear power, with construction costs more than doubling from \u20ac3bn to over \u20ac6bn \u2013 and rising for each of the French-designed European pressurised reactors being built in Finland at Olkiluoto, and Flamanville in France.</p> <p>Separately, since Germany's RWE and E.ON in March <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/29/nuclear-reactors-rwe-eon-energy\" title=\"\">pulled out of the UK's second nuclear consortium, Horizon Nuclear Power</a>, two Chinese nuclear state corporations, China Guangdong Nuclear Power and State Nuclear Power Technology, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/20/china-uk-nuclear-power-plants\" title=\"\">are considering taking on the consortium</a>. Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear energy corporation, has also expressed an interest in the UK nuclear market.</p> <p>At this point, it's worth looking at the underlying business ethics of the Russian and Chinese nuclear industries, and questioning the wisdom of their strategic involvement in key UK energy infrastructure.</p> <p>Russia's Rosatom has recently built the hugely controversial nuclear power plant in Iran at Bushehr, and is ready to help Iran build another power generating unit there, despite reports that Iran has installed an underground uranium enrichment facility, potentially paving the way for nuclear weapons development.</p> <p>In Tibet, the Chinese nuclear industry is engaged in a determined effort to secure uranium deposits located in Amdo, where leaching and open pit extraction are reported to have resulted in significant environmental contamination. Regulation of safety oversight mechanisms is relatively weak in the Chinese nuclear industry, and according to a recent <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Nuclear Materials Security Index report</a>, China ranks 29th among the group of 32 nuclear nations in terms of nuclear security and materials transparency. Although it's to be hoped that greater corporate social responsibility and sensitivity to vulnerable industrial communities is evolving in both Russia and China, it's still troubling to reflect on their respective human rights situations, documented by Amnesty International.</p> <p>A more responsible way forward to this ethically questionable strategy can be found closer to home.</p> <p>Germany uses 20% of all European electricity, and its decision to go nuclear-free by 2020, meeting power and CO2 targets by investing in renewables and energy efficiency, grid network infrastructure, and planning for trans-boundary pumped storage hydroelectricity, with combined heat and power gas and some coal as interim measures, will prove significant for all European energy policy.</p> <p>Germany also views its non-nuclear energy policy as a driver of economic expansion. As Chancellor Angela Merkel says: \"We can achieve a transformation to efficient and renewable energy, with all the opportunities that brings for exports, developing new technologies and jobs.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Dorfman is the founder of the <a href=\"http://www.nuclearconsult.com/index.php\" title=\"\">Nuclear Consulting Group</a> and a nuclear policy researcher at the <a href=\"http://www.jrct.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust</a></p>",

It can be a curse\"). No wonder: here was a Corrie matriarch of the old school; bust like a fortress, agenda hewn from coral lipstick and galvanised steel, tongue you could use to sandpaper the skirting boards. The Horlicks-to-poison ratio may not yet be as well defined as those of her battleaxe predecessors, but two weeks in and Gloria (Sue Johnston, a world away from Brookside's home-permed drudgery) already feels part of the Weatherfield furniture, running rings around an exasperated Stella, harassing the menfolk (\"Ooh, hello!\") and steaming up Norris's glasses with plans to turn the Rovers into a rustic-inspired gastropub with cross-generational plate-appeal (\"Cumberland sausage is all the rage in Clitheroe \u2026\").

Then, last week, a breakthrough: with Michael demanding he repay his massive debts, Ian wondered if selling his stall was his only option. \"Maybe it's karma,\" he mused glumly during a conversation with Phil. \"Maybe I deserve it.\" Phil regarded him with interest. \"Look atcha,\" he barked, thoughtfully. \"You wanna gerra grip.\" Then daughter Lucy galumphed into view and started banging on about how \"we need more money\" and \"this situation ain't right, Dad\" and something snapped. \"ENOUGH, bellowed Ian, sending bananas and extras scattering. \"I HAD A BREAKDOWN, NOT A LOBOTOMY\" \u2013 and lo, order was restored and the planets returned to their usual positions.

  "<p>This week we've set ourselves the challenge (along with most of the developers here at the Guardian) of undertaking <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun\">Functional Programming Principles in Scala</a>. <a href=\"http://www.scala-lang.org/\">Scala</a> is the main programming language that we use at the Guardian, and through studying this course we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the language, learn new features and improve our programming style. The course is devised and delivered by Scala's creator, <a href=\"http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/\">Martin Odersky</a> and we're excited by the insights he's sure to reveal.</p> <p>One of the first things that jumped out at us is how well-organised the course is. A common complaint of Scala is that it can be quite complicated to get the tools up and running before you are ready to begin writing code. Upon entering the portal for the course, however, we found ourselves presented with well laid-out instructions for getting started on each of the major operating systems. Concise written instructions as well as detailed screencasts are available to take you through setting up a working development environment that includes the language, the build tool and an IDE. On top of that, pre-configured downloads of these tools are available if you don't want to get your hands dirty configuring the required plugins manually. For a programmer setting out to learn Scala for the first time, these details mean the course has perhaps already been a worthwhile endeavour, even before the lectures and assignments have started.</p> <p>We're into the first week now so we've seen the format for the course. Every week, Odersky releases a set of video lectures and perhaps some accompanying reading material that you can consume at your own pace. When you feel ready, there's a homework assignment comprised of a few programming exercises that put into practice the theories and techniques learnt during the week. So far the assignments have been fun and we're already looking forward to having some more problems to tackle next week. </p> <p>The bulk of the course is the video lectures, which are given clearly and concisely and interspersed very neatly with small optional questions and exercises. Given his rich background in computing, Odersky has a lot of knowledge to share and one of the wonderful things about this course is to be given the opportunity to benefit from his teaching. It's only the first week and we've already learnt some new concepts. Once the course progresses and the content gets more advanced, we'll certainly have broadened our programming skills.</p> <p>One of the most interesting features of the course design is the assignment submission process, using <a href=\"http://www.scala-sbt.org/\">SBT</a>. The tools come with an SBT plugin which will, with a single command, send your code to their servers where a few minutes later your work gets automatically graded, according to your code's style and functionality. Your assignments page shows a log of all your submissions with a score and feedback, including a useful stack trace of any errors. While such a tool is obviously required for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odersky/status/248768435599863808\">such a popular course</a>, the flawless implementation delights in its simplicity and makes submitting the assignments a real pleasure.</p> <p>While it's great that everything is so well set-up to make it easy for beginners to get started, this does mean the downloadable projects come in a slightly non-standard layout. Because we already use Scala here in our day-to-day work we found integrating the projects with our own toolchain (in particular, <a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">IntelliJ</a>) a bit tricky. After a bit of tinkering we've made it work, so if like us, you'd rather use IntelliJ to work on the project, then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2012/sep/21/funtional-programming-principles-scala-setting-up-intellij\">check out our blog post that takes you through the configuration</a>.</p> <p>Now that we're up and running with IntelliJ, we're looking forward to getting stuck into Scala. Looking ahead at the syllabus, the next few weeks will involve reasoning about functions and immutable objects, core data structures in Scala and utilising functional techniques such as pattern matching. We might not be leaving our computers for a while...</p>",
  "<p>Every week 15m of us push our shopping trolleys up and down the aisles of the Co-op's 3,000 stores. As we do so, the in-store radio plugs their deals of the week. When we settle up at the checkout, the till displays promote their latest venture: legal services.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/apr/03/uks-first-chain-high-street-lawyers\" title=\"\">QualitySolicitors</a> (QS) might have private equity clout to fund a \u00a315m advertising campaign (designed by Team Saatchi no less), but the Co-op has a store on every high street and potentially up to 1,000 bank branches (if you count its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/19/co-op-lloyds-branches-high-street-bank\" title=\"\">recent purchase of 632 Lloyds branches</a>). It also has the one thing that no law firm or law firm marketing scheme like QS is ever likely to achieve \u2013 with or without TV ads in the middle of Downton Abbey \u2013 a brand that many of us have warm feelings towards, underpinned by the Co-operative ethos.</p> <p>On Thursday Co-operative Legal Services launched its new family law arm of its business. Earlier this year Co-op became the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/apr/02/abs-tesco-law-here\" title=\"\">first consumer brand</a> to become an ABS (alternative business structure) and among the first three ABSs regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.</p> <p>In a movement named after its high street rival (Tesco Law), the Co-op's progress into legal services has been somewhat overlooked. Their foray into family law is well-timed and might well change the face of consumer legal services. The retailer has 500 staff at its headquarters in Bristol (20 in its family department in Paddington, London with room for 80) and ambitions to recruit 3,000 lawyers in five years.</p> <p>The retailer claims to have developed a low-price, fixed fee tariff for family work. Non-lawyers might well be stunned that fixed pricing in divorce counts for an innovation in the rarified world of legal services. Relationship breakdown might be one of the most upsetting and financially precarious times of life, but family lawyers remain wedded to the hourly rate - only compounding uncertainty.</p> <p>If priced correctly, the family offering will be well received, especially in the context of the dreadful legal aid reforms which will strip publicly-funded legal advice in family law except where there is domestic violence.</p> <p>\"I personally think it is an absolute tragedy,\" Christina Blacklaws, director of family law with the Co-operative Legal Services, said of the legal aid act last week. Blacklaws joined the retailer from legal aid firm TV Edwards at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/nov/10/coop-move-into-family-division\" title=\"\">end of last year</a> (together with managing partner Jenny Beck and head of business development, Chris May). The Co-op already does a lot of publicly-funded family work, including child protection, and is applying for more contracts in the current tender round. \"We, and all other advice agencies, need to work together,\" the lawyer told me.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We will continue to offer legal aid for as long as we can. We might well be the last man standing when it comes to legal aid.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Ironic perhaps that the largest legal aid family practice (if the Co-op isn't the largest already) could be a new style ABS \u2013 doubly ironic if it is \"the last man standing\". Critics of deregulation have argued that new-style market entrants would only be interested in those more profitable aspects of legal practice, ditching the less remunerative. \"The expectation is that big business will storm the aisles like a deranged contestant on Supermarket Sweep throwing all the money-making stuff \u2013 personal injury, conveyancing etc \u2013 into its trolley and leaving non-remunerative, publicly funded law to gather dust on the shelf,\" I <a href=\"http://www.newlawjournal.co.uk/nlj/comment/reply/1118\" title=\"\">observed in 2008</a>.</p> <p>In the run up to the passing of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/29/contents\" title=\"\">Legal Services Act 2007</a>, the Law Society even tried to argue that new market entrants should be made to offer financial support to existing law firms to \"safeguard access to justice\".</p> <p>Eddie Ryan, who was MD of the Co-operative Legal Services up until July, used to talk of the Co-op's relationship with members as \"wrapping our arms about people who need our help\". Legal services appear to be a great fit for the Co-op brand.</p> <p>When I spoke to Christina Blacklaws last week, she talked of the guiding principle for its move into the legal services being its \"ethos, the ethical standards of the Co-op and everything that stands for\". That ethos is articulated this week in a new <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/legalservices/family-and-relationships/our-charter/\" title=\"\">customer charter</a>, number one being \"no nasty surprises. Apparently that principled stance will also inform their lawyering, including in the emotionally fraught area of divorce. \"If people want a Rottweiler, they can go somewhere else,\" Blacklaws told me.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the forthcoming QualitySolicitors TV campaign will be \"openly anti-supermarket law (as well as anti-bank law and anti-breakdown company law). \"Legal services offered by supermarkets and others will be faceless and entirely remote and miss the crucial local, personal element,\" <a href=\"http://www.qualitysolicitors.com/qualitysolicitors-legalzoom\" title=\"\">says founder</a> Craig Holt.</p> <p>The flashpoints for competition in the newly\u2013liberalised world of legal services are already around greater standards, accessibility, price transparency and innovation in the delivery of services. Frankly, lawyers have much to learn from other sectors.</p>",
  "<p>A high court judge has ordered that more than 1,000 international students at London Metropolitan University should be allowed to start their courses on Monday pending the outcome of a legal battle over their future.</p> <p>But Mr Justice Irwin refused to quash the home secretary's decision to suspend the university's licence to sponsor overseas students, saying that it should not be able to recruit a fresh wave of students in January until the matter has been settled legally. The judge granted permission for the university to launch a full-scale legal challenge to the revocation of its highly trusted status by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to sponsor international students on 29 August.</p> <p>The decision left in limbo more than 2,000 overseas students who were studying or were about to start courses at the north London university and who faced the stark choice of finding another university place or leaving the country.</p> <p>Irwin said he was moving to protect students from outside the European Economic Association area who were already in Britain and whose immigration status was in order. The temporary order covers more than 1,000 students already on LMU courses or who are starting on Monday, but many remain unhappy at their treatment.</p> <p>Seyda Yilmaz, 20, from Istanbul, who is about to start the third year of a \u00a310,000-a-year journalism course, said: \"I was told I needed a new visa, even though I have a valid visa until 2013. It's been a month now that we've been having these difficulties and I've been trying to find a new institution. I have found one, and if I can change my university, then I really want to, because I don't want to stay with London Met, with all these problems.\"</p> <p>The judge also ordered that those who had decided to transfer to other universities should not lose out financially. The Home Office has already said it would allow a further group of 400 students to complete their courses. The exact number reprieved was not clear on Friday night as the details were still being negotiated.</p> <p>Professor Malcolm Gillies, vice-chancellor of London Metropolitan, said he was delighted by the \"very good news\", adding: \"It's an important issue and there are lessons for all to learn.\"</p> <p>A third year student, Donna Marie Winstanley, from Hong Kong told the BBC: \"It's really good. I have not applied to any other universities. I had a feeling that the university was going to win the case. Most of my classmates have already applied. I didn't want to pay any more money. I had already paid \u00a316,000 in fees for my first two years.''</p> <p>The judge rejected legal arguments from the university's lawyers that the home secretary, Theresa May, had acted disproportionately, or was not justified in revoking its overseas students licence.</p> <p>But he did accept it was \"just arguable\" that she had acted unfairly in not allowing the university sufficient time to respond to UKBA concerns before suspending its licence. He said a full legal hearing was needed to test the university's claim that the decision had been taken under guidance that had not been approved by parliament or referred to anywhere in the immigration rules.</p> <p>The university's counsel, Richard Gordon QC, said because of this, there was a strong prima facie case that the UKBA's decision was unlawful. \"The financial impact on the university, and on its reputation and good will, are enormous. The impact on students' education, financial position and the disruption to their lives is extremely significant,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"It is not easy to see how, when the UKBA can't point to any [current] student who is in breach of immigration control requirements, how - with a decision that affects huge numbers of innocent students - the threat to immigration control has justified so draconian a decision as revocation or indeed suspension.\"</p> <p>But Lisa Giovannetti QC, for the Home Office, said it could not be suggested that LMU was not made aware what the concerns were as the university had been aware for \"months and months\" that its systems simply did not comply with sponsorship requirements.</p> <p>It was not suggested that LMU had deliberately breached the regulations, and it had made attempts to put things right, but had been unable to do that effectively, she told the judge.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the UKBA said: \"UKBA agreed to allow existing genuine students to continue studying at the university until their course has ended or the end of the academic year, whichever is sooner, as long as they meet the right standards. But students who are here illegally and do not meet our immigration criteria will not be allowed to stay.</p> <p>\"Revoking the university's licence was the right course of action and we will continue to fight their challenge at the full hearing.\"</p> <p>The Home Office has said that action was taken after it found that 26 students out of a sample of 101 were studying at LMU even though they did not have leave to remain in Britain. It also claimed that the lack of required monitoring meant there was no proof that students were turning up to lectures in 142 of 250 (57%) of those sampled. LMU rejected claims of systemic failings and said the revocation decision was based on a highly flawed UKBA report.</p>",
  "<p>The dance has inspired a host of parodies, the song has hit the top of the charts in South Korea, Malaysia, Finland and Latvia, and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0\" title=\"\">YouTube video</a> has accumulated more than 227m views. Now, according to Thai media, Gangnam Style, by the K-pop star Psy, has inspired a West Side Story-esque show of rivalry between two Bangkok gangs who are said to have had a dance-off before engaging in a gun battle.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.innnews.co.th/shownews/show?newscode=405843\" title=\"\">INN</a> website reported that the two gangs were dining in the same restaurant when \"the younger members of both groups danced provocatively at each other in the manner of top hit Gangnam Style\". The dance-off escalated into an argument and, eventually, a gun attack in the upmarket Ekkamai neighbourhood, in which one of the gangs <a href=\"http://www.coconutsbangkok.com/news/bangkok-gangs-danced-gangnam-style-before-ekkamai-gun-battle-report-claims/\" title=\"\">fired at least 50 bullets from a carbine and an 11mm gun</a>.</p> <p>No one was injured in the incident, police Lt Col Apichart Thongchandee <a href=\"http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/313385/over-50-bullets-fired-in-ekamai\" title=\"\">told the Bangkok Post</a>. He said the two gangs had a history of confrontation and would face arrest warrants.</p> <p>The shootout has stoked debate over gang violence in Thailand. Much of the violence plays out in secondary schools and vocational colleges \u2013 the latter primarily cater to working-class children \u2013 where students seek to defend their school's honour with guns, knives, machetes and even homemade grenades. Between January and July this year, Bangkok police registered more than 1,000 cases of student rivalry, according to a recent <a href=\"http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/featurenews/view/1223877/1/.html\" title=\"\">report by Agence France-Presse</a>. Several students have been killed or injured since the start of the school year in May.</p> <p>Thai authorities recently established an army-style boot camp where, according to AFP, repeat offenders must endure regular fitness drills and 5am wake-up calls side by side with their rivals. Not all those attending went back home reformed, Lt Col Wanchana Sawasdeem said, \"but for 90% it will work, even if it just means they hesitate before fighting \u2026 At least the camp will have made them think.\"</p> <p>That the two gangs apparently engaged in a Gangnam Style dance-off is indicative of the video's popularity. Psy, otherwise known as Park Jae-Sang, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/19658732\" title=\"\">told Radio 1's Scott Mills</a> this week that his distinctive dance style emulated \"riding an invisible horse in your lower body\". The video features Park doing the dance all over Seoul \u2013 from car parks to steam rooms \u2013 with a supporting cast dressed as geishas, nuns and boxers. Park sports various outfits, among them a blue tuxedo together with shellacked bouffant and sunglasses. \"This is the point of the Gangnam Style,\" Park told Mills. \"Dress classy and dance cheesy.\"</p> <p>The track, which is said to mock the affluent Seoul suburb Gangnam, could become the first Korean pop song to reach number one in the UK charts, according to the BBC. Park has already featured on numerous US TV shows, taught the horse-riding dance to Britney Spears, and helped inspire <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/09/21/saying-i-do-gangnam-style.html\" title=\"\">a flash-mob wedding proposal</a> in Malaysia.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>9.15am: Today it's the Ukip annual conference and I was up early to get on a train to Birmingham. I've never been to a Ukip conference before. In fact, only a few years ago, any half-decent political correspondent volunteering to attend would have been dismissed by colleagues as an eccentric. That was in the era (2006) <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4875026.stm\">when David Cameron dismissed them as \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly\". </a>Now they are still a minor party and they don't have any MPs. But they came second in the European elections in 2009, they are level-pegging with the Lib Dems in the polls and they exercise a potent influence on Conservative party politics. Anyone interested in the British political scene would be foolish to ignore them.</p> <p>My colleague Martin Kettle explored this in detail <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/ukip-force-shape-2015-election\">in his Guardian column yesterday.</a> He argued that, as the 2015 election approaches, there are two key reasons why Ukip matters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first is the Ukip factor itself. From 2009's 16.5% in the Europeans, Ukip slumped to 3.1% in the 2010 general election. A disastrous fall? Undoubtedly. The party crumpled.<br>But that 3.1% \u2013 still nearly a million votes \u2013 may have made some of the difference between a hung parliament and an outright Tory win. Small though it was, the Ukip vote exceeded the majority in 21 marginals the Tories failed to win in 2010, including Ed Balls's seat in West Yorkshire. If Ukip does as so many expect, and fares even better in the 2014 Europeans than in 2009, the Tory fear of a palpable Ukip effect in the 2015 general election will be even greater than before, even if Ukip's vote tanks again as it did in 2010. Any Conservative with a majority of 1,500 votes or fewer may be at risk.</p> <p>The second reason why Ukip success matters is because of Britain's place in post-eurozone crisis Europe. The competition between the parties on whether to promise an EU referendum \u2013 and, crucially, what question it would ask \u2013 is already intense behind the scenes. Every Ukip success is likely to push that competition further towards an in-out referendum pledge. Even if that does not come about \u2013 and a referendum on a less cut-and-dried choice of the sort that is apparently preferred by David Cameron would certainly cause problems for Ukip \u2013 the momentum of the whole process is towards increased UK marginalisation within whatever remains of the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the Ukip conference in the Birmingham town hall today, the highlight will be the speech by Nigel Farage, Ukip's leader. Farage was on the Today programme at 8.10 this morning talking the possibility of a doing some kind of deal with the Conservatives before the next general election. I'll write a full post about his comments soon. He will be speaking at 11.45am.</p> <p>But I will also be writing about the rest of the conference too. It opens at 9.45am and the full agenda is <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/page/conference-schedule\">here.</a> Ukip has in the past been vulnerable to charge that it's a one-man band, the Farage party, an outfit whose success is largely dependent on the efforts of one accomplished campaigner in a pin-striped suit. Today I want to see what the rest of them look like close up too.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@Andrew Sparrow.</a> I won't be updating this blog quite as regularly as I normally do when I'm writing my daily Politics Live, but there should be updates at least every hour.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>9.28am: <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> has been talking this morning about the possibility of Ukip doing some kind of deal with the Conservatives before the general election. His message has not been entirely clear.</p> <p>At Euston this morning I picked up a copy of the Daily Express. It's not normally the first paper I turn to in the morning, but it has become the Ukip house journal and, sure enough, there on page two was <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/347306/Ukip-leader-offers-a-poll-pact-with-Tories\">a story about the speech Farage will give today.</a> Here's how it starts.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UKIP leader Nigel Farage will today make a dramatic offer to David Cameron to form a pact with the Tories at the next General Election.</p> <p>He will use his keynote speech at Ukip's annual conference to raise the prospect of an alliance at the polls.</p> <p>But he will demand in return the promise of an in-or-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>But then, when Farage was asked about this in his interview on the Today programme, this is how he started his reply.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>I haven't offered a deal at all. What has happened here is in Tory circles they fear that the Lib Dems will move to the Left and will head towards Labour, leaving the Conservative party very exposed. They look at Ukip at 10% in the polls and they say 'we've got to do a deal with Ukip'.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage then went on the clarify his position, in a way that stands up the Express story. I've taken the quote from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm responding to many voices within the Conservative party, and what I've said is we're a different party with a different manifesto, but if we were offered a deal that made it easier to push open a door marked 'independence for the United Kingdom' of course we'd consider it.</p> <p>But I wouldn't even contemplate doing a deal, even if it gave the party an advantage, unless we first had, written in blood I think, an absolute promise that we would have a proper referendum on our relationship with the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>As Macer Hall says in his Express story, there are some Tories who want their party to form some kind of non-aggression pact with Ukip at the general election.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tory Euro MP Daniel Hannan said yesterday: \"I'd like to move to a position where people who vote Ukip and people who vote Conservative at the moment can support the same candidates.\"</p> <p>Earlier this week, senior Tory MP Brian Binley wrote on his internet blog: \"Support for Ukip is growing. Conservatives and Ukip share a lot of common ground on Europe and a re-alignment with supporters of Ukip on the issue might also help win back some of the voters who abandoned us for them after the last election.</p> <p>\"We can't keep patronising Ukip as extremists. They represent the strength of feeling on an issue that is so important to the British people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresecoffey/status/248959181774807040\">on Twitter</a> the Tory MP <strong>Therese Coffey</strong> said that Farage seemed to rule out a pact with the Conservatives only five days ago, when he was interviewed<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01mnqqz/Westminster_Hour_16_09_2012/\"> on the Westminster Hour. </a>She's got a point. I've been listening to the programme and this is what Farage said when he was asked if Ukip would stand down at the next election in seats where Tory candidates were calling for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No. Our intention is to fight every seat in the country at the next election. We are not just about Europe. We are about how we re-invigorate Britain once we've left.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.20am: I've arrived. The press room at Birmingham town hall obviously doubles up as a broom cupboard, and so I'm inside the main hall itself, perched near the top of the balcony. According to Ukip, around 900 members are coming to the conference and there must be several hundred in the hall already. I couldn't get a seat downstairs. As I type, <strong>Mike Read</strong>, the former Radio 1 DJ, is speaking. He's already mentioned Churchill, and I've only been here five minutes. And he's winding up now.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will soon be time to say once more: \"The long night of European darkness is over. Good morning, Great Britain.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>You get the gist ...</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>10.52am: Nigel Farage will be speaking in about an hour's time. Before he starts, here's a Farage reading list.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/20/nigel-farage-ukip-leader-interview\">\u2022 Nigel Farage told the Observer in a long interview earlier this year that Ukip could trigger a realignment of British politics.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can he imagine 20 more years of [campaign for a referendum on EU membership]?</p> <p>\"No. But I would think in the next four to five years we will either win the big question as far as we are concerned, or we will succeed in realigning a segment of the British political scene.\"</p> <p>An alliance with sceptical Conservatives?</p> <p>\"It's not completely impossible there will be some SDP-type moment, a coming together of different people over this one issue. Eventually, this question will have to be resolved.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9543841/UKIP-axes-pounds-sign-logo-saying-it-has-won-the-battle-to-save-sterling.html\">\u2022 Nigel Farage told the Daily Telegraph in an interview last week that he wanted to ditch the pound sign as the party's logo.<br></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our pound sign has been a fantastically simple image. But now it is in my opinion represents a battle honour and not a forward looking aspiration for a party that wants to represent an independent UK.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100181226/nigel-farage-has-to-save-ukip-from-its-golf-club-eccentricity/\">\u2022 Tim Stanley at the Telegraph says Nigel Farage is the only person holding Ukip together.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The appearance of coherence is the genius of Nigel Farage. Farage is one of Britain's great everyman conservatives, with an innocent, unblinking expression that suggests a pug being gently squeezed from its middle. Like Boris or Nadine, \"Nige\" is an anti-politician. He visits lap dancing clubs, smokes, drinks and is alleged to have had an affair with a Latvian woman he met in a pub in Biggin Hill. The ordinariness defuses the potential extremism of UKIP's manifesto and injects some real world outrage into politics. There are too few conservatives like him left \u2013 men in camel hair coats who would abolish the income tax and swap the Channel Tunnel for a brick wall. But such is the power of Farage's joyful libertarianism that I wonder if UKIP would survive without him. It could either split into philosophical factions or, as it did under Lord Pearson, simply fail to generate attention.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/19/nigel-farage-tory-donors-ukip?newsfeed=\" true\"\">\u2022 Farage tells Michael White in a Guardian interview that disillusioned Tory voters are turning to Ukip.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9553120/Pinstripes-plain-views-and-areal-problem-for-Cameron.html\">\u2022 Paul Goodman in the Telegraph says Farage's long-term goal is to split the Conservative party.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Ukip leader has had testicular cancer, led his party before, stopped leading it, nearly died in a plane clash (while campaigning during the last election to win the Buckingham seat held by the Speaker), and come back to lead Ukip again. In other words, he is a tough old thing who gives his turbulent party momentum by sheer force of character. His contempt for Messrs Cameron and Osborne would curdle low-fat milk but, significantly, doesn't extend to the older generation of senior Conservative politicians, of whom he speaks with guarded respect. His plan is evident: to gain the In/Out EU referendum that would split the Conservatives in half, and to realign British politics, much as the Common Market referendum of 1975 did.</p> <p>After all, a new force eventually emerged from the cross-party alliances formed during that referendum \u2013 the SDP. The Ukip leader evidently hopes that similar co-operation during another referendum would bring a similar outcome \u2013 that a No vote and Tory splits would divide the Cameroon leadership of the party from its base. The latter, joined with Ukip, would then morph to become the full-blooded Thatcherite party that even Lady Thatcher herself never quite led. Hence his recent decision to drop the party's long title and replace its pound-sign symbol. Hence, too, Ukip's support for grammar schools and opposition to gay marriage. Mr Farage is trying to wean his party off the EU issue alone, woo traditional Tory voters and park his guerrilla army on Mr Cameron's lawn.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>11.16am: And here are some more lines from the various interviews that Nigel Farage has been giving this morning, in addition to the points he was making about the (very, very remote, it sounded to me) possibility of a pact with the Conservatives at the election. (See 9.28am.) I've taken the quotes from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a><br><strong><br>\u2022 Farage said he had more respect for Boris Johnson than for any other leading Conservative politician.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have to say I have a great regard for Boris, he is the only leading Conservative figure who stands up and says things that many UKIP members agree with ... When I hear him talking about the City of London and the fact that it is a rather valuable asset, he is closer to us, but he's not quite UKIP yet.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 Farage said Ukip were rightwing on some issues and liberal on others.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think on economics, you can put us on the centre-right. But on issues of liberty - we're the party that believe in habeas corpus, we're the party that wants a smaller state. In that sense we're classical liberals.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that most people joining Europe were coming over to the party from the Conservatives.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we have, since the last general election, got the Conservative party worried. A lot of people have come to us; some from the Lib-Dems, some from Labour, but the bulk that have come to us in the last two years from the Tories. They look at David Cameron and what they see is another brand of social democracy.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 He said Ukip's politicians had more real-life experience than the government's.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>I think people think we're being run by a bunch of college kids. They look at UKIP and think, well they may not be perfect, but at least it's led and full of people who've run businesses and got experience of life.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 He said Nick Clegg would probably be gone as Lib Dem leader within two years.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that schools do not teach pupils about British history or Christianity.</strong><br><strong><br>\u2022 He claimed that 75% of British laws originate from Brussels.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that Ukip wanted to spend more money on defence because the cuts to the armed forces were \"absolutely shameful\".</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said too many 18-year-olds were going to university.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Ukip wanted a 31% flat tax on all incomes over \u00a311,500. National insurance would be abolished under Ukip, he said.</strong></p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>11.33am: Farage claims that 75% of British laws come from Brussels. (See 11.16am.) But <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP10-62\">the House of Commons library has had a look at this issue and published a paper on it.</a> Its conclusion is different.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>All measurements have their problems. To exclude EU regulations from the calculation is likely to be an under-estimation of the proportion of EU-based national laws, while to include all EU regulations in the calculation is probably an over-estimation. The answer in numerical terms lies somewhere in between the two approaches, and it is possible to justify any measure between 15% and 50% or thereabouts. Other EU 'soft law' measures under the Open Method of Coordination are difficult to quantify as they often take the form of objectives and common targets. Analyses rarely look into EU soft law, the role of EU standard setting or self-regulatory measures.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>11.38am: Back in the hall, <strong>Lord Hesketh</strong> is giving the warm up speech for Farage. Hesketh is one of Ukip's prize defectors; he was a minister in the Thatcher government and chief whip in the Lords under John Major, but left the Conservatives for Ukip last year. He mentions Neville Chamberlain (his grandfather was Chamberlain's PPS, he says) and he says Chamberlain deserves credit for keeping Britain out a slump in the 1930s because he spent money on rearmament. He says the whole of Europe is becoming disenchanted with a political class that cannot be trusted to tell the truth, and he suggests that Europe needs an 1848-style revolution.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>11.53am: <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> is on the stage now. He starts by welcoming to the stage three councillors who have defected to Ukip from the Conservatives. And he welcomes to the stage <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19627027\">Lord Stevens of Ludgate, the former chair of United Newspapers, who joined the party this week.</a></p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>12.00pm: <strong>Lord Stevens</strong> is speaking now. He cites David Cameron's quote about Ukip being full of \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\". (See 9.15am.) It's a pleasure to join you, he says.</p> <p>He says he finally decided to join Ukip<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9411876/David-Cameron-says-Britain-should-not-leave-EU.html\"> when Cameron told the Telegraph in an interview earlier this summer that he would never campaign for Britain to leave the EU.</a></p> <p>He says Britain could have a perfectly good free-trade agreement with the European Union. There should be an in/out referendum, he says.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>12.07pm: <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> is speaking now.</p> <p>Something has changed, he says. At the general election Ukip got 3% of the vote. But now they are up to 12% in some polls, he says.</p> <p>What has changed? They have been lucky with their enemies, he says.</p> <p>But it is not about individuals. People look at the three parties. \"They look the same, they sound the same.\" And they look like college kids, he says.</p> <p>Ukip is run by people with some understanding of the real world.</p> <p>Ukip has also got better, he says. In the 1990s \"it was a bit shambolic\". But now it is more organised. It came second in the Barnsley byelection.</p> <p>The Human Rights Act has turned justice on its head. People want a debate on that, he says.</p> <p>People support Ukip because they see it as the voice of opposition on a whole range of issues, he goes on.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>12.10pm: Farage says Ukip is \"not a one-trick pony\".</p> <p>It is reaching out to people concerned about things like windfarms.</p> <p>But Europe is the key issue, and it is rising to the top of the agenda.</p> <p>This week Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, gave a speech that let the cat out of the bag. He used the f-word (federation) for the first time.</p> <p>The EU wants a constitutional change that would rule out the need for further referenda, he says.</p> <p>Farage says Barroso called him \"an extreme populist\". And he said Ukip was irrelevant to the main debate.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, Mr Barroso, it is Ukip's intention to make you eat those words.</p> </blockquote> <p>That gets the biggest round of applause so far.</p> <p>He says the new treaty proposed by Barroso is so extreme that no UK party would back it. Even the Lib Dems would not support it, he says.</p> <p>So a referendum on this question is inevitable, he says.</p> <p>People might argue that that is good news.</p> <p>But Farage says he is \"very worried\" by what he sees.</p> <p>From David Owen to Liam Fox, we now see the political class uniting behind a political position.</p> <p>There is growing support for allowing Britain to be part of a customs union with the rest of the EU.</p> <p>He says Cameron will propose a referendum on whether Britain should be part of the full federal EU, or whether it should just be part of a customs union.</p> <p>But this would stop Britain negotiating its own customs agreements with the rest of the EU, he says.</p> <p>Farage says he wants Britain to be able to have a free trade deal with the Commonwealth. (This gets a very big round of applause too.)</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>12.17pm: Farage says the EU wants Britain to have an \"open door\" to the whole of eastern Europe.</p> <p>That would be irresponsible with unemployment as high as it is.</p> <p>And Britain should not be subject to the European court, he says.</p> <p>That's why there needs to be a full in/out referendum.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>12.19pm: Farage turns to the issue of a deal with other political parties.</p> <p>Some of the press reporting is wrong, he says. Ukip is a full, independent party.</p> <p>But Ukip would be \"silly\" not to consider something that might bring closer the chance of an in/out referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>All this talk of a deal with the Conservatives has not come from me. It has come from the Conservatives.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clegg will go to Brussels before the 2015 election to replace Lady Ashton, he says. Under Vince Cable, the Lib Dems will float the idea of a deal with Labour. In those circumstances, if Ukip are 10% in the polls, the Tories will want to do a deal, he says.</p> <p>Farage says he has worked to build up Ukip. He would not do anything to jeopardise its identity, he says.</p> <p>Even if the Tories were to promise a referendum, that might not be enough. Some politicians do not keep their promises, he says. Any deal would have to be \"written in blood\".</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>12.23pm: Farage says Ukip has not yet made a breakthrough in local elections. But next year it will fight more seats than ever. And it will use those as a springboard for the European elections, he says.</p> <p>Ukip's goal will be to win those elections. He will work night and day to achieve that, he says.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>12.26pm: The Farage speech is over. I will post a summary shortly.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>12.58pm: The conference theme music seems to be XTC's \"Making Plans for Nigel\". They played it at the end of Nigel Farage's speech, and it has been blasting intermittently through the main hall ever since. It's almost as catchy and annoying as the Clegg \"sorry\" song.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>1.20pm: Here are the main points from Nigel Farage's speech.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Farage said that Ukip's priority now was to ensure that Britain had a full in/out referendum on membership of the EU, not just a referendum on Britain having a looser relationship with the EU.</strong> None of the main political parties is yet fully committed to an EU referendum, but David Cameron has strongly signalled that the Tories would call one after the next election and it is widely assumed that the plans to renegotiate the EU treaties in the light of the Eurozone crisis will eventually lead to British voters being given a say on any new arrangements. Farage said a referendum was inevitable. But it was not the referendum Ukip wanted, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm very, very worried about what I see. From David Owen to Liam Fox, what we're now seeing is the political class uniting around a position. The position is that we don't want to be part of this new federal superstate, but we do want to be part of the customs union, and we do want to be part of the single market and that there's nothing to fear from all those things because we won't be trapped inside a political union with Europe.</p> <p>Well, I've decided to take that on and I've launched a booklet called A Referendum Stitch-up. Because what is happening is remarkably similar to what happened back in 1975 \u2026 when you were told it was a common market. They are trying to do the same thing again.</p> <p>I think what Cameron will do, next week or the week after, is to say we can have a referendum on whether we join that full federal union, or whether we stay with the single market and a customs union. And that is a battle for us. We have got to go out there as a party and make the arguments. We don't want to be stuck inside a customs union that prevents us from making our own trade deals with the rest of the world, the growing parts of the world ... We in Ukip demand that this country is given a full, free and fair choice in a referendum, so that we can decide who governs Britain.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He played down the prospects of Ukip entering into some form of electoral pact with the Conservatives before the general election. </strong>Ukip was an independent party, with its own agenda and its own candidates at elections, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But if an opportunity came which meant we could get this country closer to walking through a door marked 'UK independence,' if we had the opportunity to do something that was in our national interest, we would be silly not to even consider it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage said that talk of an electoral pact was coming from the Conservatives and that he personally would do nothing to \"sell this party short\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only way we would even consider a negotiation of any kind at all would be if first an absolute promise was made to give this country a full, free and fair referendum so that we could decide whether we remain members of the EU or not. That would have to be on the table before we even considered any proposal.</p> <p>And we would possibly have a problem even then. Some of you may have noticed that there are one or two people in politics who make promises and then break them. So I don't think a cast-iron guarantee would satisfy Ukip. At the minimum, it would have to be written in blood.</p> </blockquote> <p>What does \"written in blood\" actually mean? The only plausible interpretation must be \"written in statute\" - ie, the government would have to pass legislation before the 2015 election for a referendum afterwards. The chances of that are minuscule.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Ukip's aim was to win the European elections in 2014.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>By then we may well have the bones of a new treaty. We will have a political class doing their best to ignore the issue, doing their best to give us a fudged, stitched-up referendum. I think we will be in the driving seat for those European elections. I believe it must be Ukip's aim and goal to win those European elections in 2014, to cause an earthquake in British politics and to change the future of this country forever.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>1.58pm: In the past Ukip never used to receive much media attention, but this year it's rather different. There's a respectable media contingent, including the Today programme's Evan Davis and Channel 4 News' Michael Crick. Crick has been commenting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelLCrick/status/249101854796042240\">on Twitter.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of great things about UKIP conference is how it glories in its eccentricity - Union flag ties, colourful waist-coats, great moustaches</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>2.22pm:<strong> Tim Congdon</strong>, the economist, has just finished addressing the conference. He has recently produced a 56-page report called How much does the European Union cost Britain? and it claims that EU membership costs Britain around 10% of GDP, or \u00a3150bn. It is the latest version of a report that Ukip has been producing annually and Congdon said that he wanted it to become \"the best document produced by a political party in the country\".</p> <p>So it's a shame that I can't find a link. There's <a href=\"http://www.betteroffout.net/the-uk-could-be-150-billion-a-year-better-off-out-of-the-eu/\">a brief summary at the Better Off Out website,</a> but I can't find a link to the whole thing.</p> <p>Congdon attributes half the cost - 5% of GDP - to regulation. I haven't had time to read the whole document, but his methodology seems open to challenge, to put it politely. In the chapter on the costs of regulation, he quotes an EU commissioner in October 2006 putting out a statement \"which invited the interpretation that the annual cost of EU regulation was 600 billion euros, or 5% of GDP\". Perhaps it invited other interpretations too, but I don't know because I have not had time to check. And the report also says that Peter Mandelson told the CBI in 2004 that EU red tape cost 4% of GDP. After a quick search, I've been unable to find the quote to back it up. Does anyone have the link? I used to cover CBI conferences regularly during that period and, if Mandelson did say that, I think I would have remembered.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>2.49pm: <strong>Timo Soini</strong>, the leader of the True Finns party (a Ukip sister party in the European Parliament) has just finished speaking now. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/21/true-finns-nationalist-populists-european-parties\">Their electoral success last year generated the kind of political earthquake, apparently, that Farage wants to achieve here. </a>His speech included references to at least two Tory heroes. Describing the Eurocrats as \"pillocks\", he praised Margaret Thatcher and inverted one of her best known sayings.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think they [the Eurocrats] hated your prime minister so much that they decided to do exactly the opposite in every single detail ... Where there is harmony, they will bring discord. Where there is truth, they will bring error. Where there is faith, they will bring doubt. And where there is hope, they will bring despair.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also ended by quoting Churchill: \"We will never surrender.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>3.08pm: The economist <strong>Roger Bootle</strong> is addressing the conference now. He says that the creation of the euro was a mistake and that the best solution would be for Germany to leave. What's more likely to happen is that another country beginning with G (Greece) will leave, he says.<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18721155\"> Bootle, of course, won the Wolfson Economics prize for working out a method as to how this could happen.</a></p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>4.05pm: So, what have we learnt? In news terms, I think I have already summarised the main points. (See 1.20pm.) But the attraction of coming to a party conference is to see what a party looks like close up and, in that respect, coming to Birmingham has been worthwhile. It is refreshing to come to a party conference that is not swamped by corporate lobbyists and PR executives in smart suits. There are none of those here, just hundreds of (mostly quite elderly) party activists. And, even if Ukip isn't your cup of tea, it is generally invigorating to spend time in an environment full of people with a passion for their politics and strong views. It's not always like that at the main party conferences.</p> <p>As for my conclusions, here are four things I've learnt.</p> <p><strong>1. Speculating about a Ukip/Conservative electoral pact is a waste of time because it is not going to happen. </strong>That is not to say I can promise not to write about the prospect. There are <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/goldlist/2010/05/did-ukip-cost-the-tories-a-commons-majority.html\">a significant number of seats where the Ukip vote in 2010 was higher than the amount by which the Conservative candidate lost</a> and, as the election approaches, there is bound to be some kind of pressure for a deal \u2013 either seat-by-seat, or nationally \u2013 that would prevent a split in the Eurosceptic vote. But exactly the same kind of discussions took place before the 2010 general election, and they got nowhere. Even David Heathcoat-Amory, who was so Eurosceptic that he resigned as a minister from John Major's government over the issue, could not persuade Ukip to give him a free run. As he recalls bitterly <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Confessions-Eurosceptic-David-Heathcoat-Amory/dp/1781590486\">in his memoirs,</a> he thinks this led to him being defeated by the much more pro-European Lib Dem, Tessa Munt. Ukip seems too established as a party to want to contemplate these deals. Nigel Farage made this point in his speech and, if you read what he said about the possibility of a deal, it is fairly clear that he does not expect it to happen.</p> <p><strong>2. Ukip is not confident about winning an EU referendum. </strong>If, like me, you have not spent much time thinking about the difference between a free trade agreement and a customs union, you might think that Ukip (who want Britain outside the EU, but with a free trade agreement) would welcome the fact that the Conservatives want a looser relationship with the EU. But Farage clearly sees this as a threat and the most interesting part of his speech was the passage that dealt with this. (See 1.20pm.) He seems to think Cameron would find it relatively easy to win a referendum about whether Britain should remain in the EU as a member of a customs union.</p> <p><strong>3. The Conservative split has already happened.</strong> Earlier I quoted from an article by Paul Goodman, the former Conservative MP, saying that Farage seeks a fundamental realignment of British politics. But, after a day here, I sense that it has already happened. Ukip activists (with a few exceptions) are members of the broad Conservative tribe. They look like old-school Tories, talk like them and sound like them. Anyone who went to a Conservative party conference before they started to become anodyne in the mid-1990s would feel perfectly at home here.<br><strong><br>4. Ukip are not just a single issue party.</strong> I've heard plenty of Euro-bashing from the platform, but they have got strong views on other topics too. After Farage, the most interesting speaker in the morning was <a href=\"http://www.godfreybloommep.co.uk/policecommisioner.html\">Godfrey Bloom, the MEP who is standing against John Prescott in the elections for police commissioner in Humberside on what could safely be described as a Daily Mail platform:</a> anti-political correctness (there is a post on his blog entitled <a href=\"http://www.godfreybloommep.co.uk/news.htm\">\"Hate crime is not a crime\"), </a>pro-motorists (speed cameras would only be allowed near accident blackspots or schools) and pro shooting burglars (Bloom said he would take disciplinary action against any officer who arrested a householder for protecting his family). This is a party with a distinct libertarian agenda. Alexandra Swann, who defected to Ukip from Conservative Future, put it like this in her speech to the conference: \"I believe in more than independence from Europe. I believe in independence for the individual.\"</p> <p>That's it for today. I'm off for the train. Tomorrow I will be blogging from the Lib Dem conference, starting at around lunchtime.</p>",
  "<p>Attempts by the criminal justice system to deal with antisocial networking in recent years have been reminiscent of awkward teenagers stumbling and fumbling their way out of virginity. They have a natural urge to do it; their friends all tell them they should be doing it, but the end results are not so much satisfaction as awkward embarrassment and a few painful abrasions.</p> <p>We took three steps forward in July, when the high court finally overturned the ludicrous conviction of Paul Chambers in the so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/27/twitter-joke-trial-high-court\" title=\"\">Twitter joke trial</a>, but two steps back last week, with the conviction of Azhar Ahmed for ranting his crass, ugly but ultimately legitimate views about British soldiers in Afghanistan. Now, at last, we see some sensible noises coming from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/dpp-prosecutions-facebook-twitter-abuse\" title=\"\">director of public prosecutions</a>. In explaining the decision not to prosecute the young Twitter user who taunted and abused diver Tom Daley during the Olympics, Keir Starmer said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The time has come for an informed debate about the boundaries of free speech in an age of social media \u2026 This case is one of a growing number involving the use of social media that the CPS has had to consider. There are likely to be many more\"<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer also announced that the DPP will launch a public consultation and issue guidelines on the legal status of offensive social media messages. Not before time.</p> <p>Barring a few free-speech fundamentalists, most of us would agree that there should be some sort of criminal threshold for online communications. Menacing threats of violence, systematic harassment and crimes of incitement are all recognised as serious offences in any medium. <a href=\"http://liberalconspiracy.org/2012/09/15/convicted-for-a-facebook-rant-where-is-free-speech-now/\" title=\"\">Clarifying the line between criminal behaviour and everyday banter, abuse, bullying, flaming and trolling</a> will be a challenge. Better wish them luck with that one.</p> <p>But the prospect of formal guidelines as to the legality of online messaging does raise the tantalising fantasy of banishing once and for all some of the most infuriating habits of my fellow social networkers and website commenters, not least here on Comment is free. If I had my way, the following offences would all warrant a stretch in the deepest dungeon, where the offender would be forced to do nothing but read the comments on YouTube until reduced to a quivering puddle of remorse.</p> <p><strong>1. Calling anyone who disagrees with you a troll. </strong>Someone who genuinely believes the NHS should be run as a Walmart franchise might be a sociopath, an idiot, a cabinet minister or all three, but he or she is not a troll. True trolls are mischievous, magical creatures that have been exposing online hypocrisy and self-righteousness since the days of Usenet. Don't insult them like this or they might just gobble you up like an errant goat.</p> <p><strong>2. Using what you know about people's work or family life against them.</strong> The devil keeps an extra sharp pitchfork to hand for anyone who has ever posted a comment like \"You're a public sector worker? I pay your wages, get back to work.\" or \"What kind of parent are you if you're chattering here online all day?\" or \"You have mental health problems? That explains your views on\u2026\" Not only does this deter people from talking frankly about their lives, it reveals the offender to be a judgmental supercilious snotrag. It's the worst.</p> <p><strong>3. Asking \"Why are we talking about this when we should be talking about that?\"</strong> Let me explain something. The internet is really, really big. You might think it's a long way down to the Post Office, as Douglas Adams might have said, but that's nothing compared to the internet. Those pixels just go on and on forever. That thing you want to talk about? There's an article about it, just over there and if there isn't, you can write your own somewhere else. I hope this helps.</p> <p><strong>4. Posting when calm and sober. </strong>I was going to write something about posting when angry and drunk, then I realised the problem is the exact opposite. Yes, many of those abusive, hurtful messages are posted when the offender has had a few, but the real problem is usually with the person at the other end who, most inconsiderately, insists upon being sober and reasonable at the time. It's true that if everyone online were always sober, the internet would be a nicer if duller place. On the other hand, if we were all bladdered, we'd simply forget what was said by the morning. In 99% of cases, that would be the best possible outcome.</p> <p>Those are my suggestions, and I'm sure you'll agree they are eminently sensible. What type of commenters would you lock up and throw away the key? Which trolls get your goat? The director of public prosecutions is eagerly awaiting your opinion, and so are we.</p>",
  "<p>On Wednesday, I accused the government of failing to act on the significant and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/29/crop-pesticides-honeybee-decline\">growing evidence</a> that neonicitinoid pesticides cause significant harm to bees. For my trouble, I was \"<a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/09/19/neonicotinoids-bees/\">mythbusted</a>\" by the department for environment, food and rural affairs (Defra).</p> <p>But I am <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/what_we_do/the_bee_cause_35033.html\">far from alone</a> in my concerns and I can now reveal that a full parliamentary enquiry is going ahead into the matter. Joan Walley MP, who chairs the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/eacom\">House of Commons environmental audit committee,</a> a powerful cross-party group that acts as parliament's green watchdog, sent this letter to the Guardian on Friday.</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Dear Sir</p> <p>Damian Carrington's blog on the government's response to recent research on the impact of insecticides on bee populations is timely (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/18/bees-pesticides-neonicitinoids\">The silence of the bees</a>). Last week the Environmental Audit Committee, which I chair, decided to undertake an inquiry looking at the effects of pesticide use in the UK on biodiversity with a specific focus on bees.</p> <p>As Damian's blog pointed out, the use (and abuse) of evidence in policy-making and formulating regulation is clearly at the heart of the matter. But there are other issues that I want our investigation to examine. What monitoring is there of actual - rather than recommended - levels of pesticide usage? What are the potential impacts of these insecticides on human health? And should Defra be encouraging alternative pest-control measures, such as natural predators and plant breeding for insect-resistance, in a bid to make UK farming more bee-friendly?</p> <p>We will be announcing details of the inquiry soon. In the meantime, Defra ministers may want to start doing their homework on pesticide policy and biodiversity, because we will be calling them before parliament to answer questions on these issues. In particular, we will be scrutinising the evidence behind the Government's decision not to revise pesticide regulations or follow other European countries in temporarily suspending the use of insecticides linked to bee decline.</p> <p>Joan Walley MP<br>Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee<br>House of Commons</p> </blockquote> <p>I have very little to add to that, beyond hoping that the MPs can flush out the trials always cited by government and pesticide companies in defence of the chemicals, but which appear not to be in the public domain. The whole issue is very murky and the MPs will shed some very welcome light.</p>",
  "<p>Still watching sexy sex? You know, the stuff that really turns you on? Ugh. That's <em>so </em>2011. Awkward sex is the new sex and 2012 has been full of it. Kicking off with the home release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/03/american-pie-reunion-review\" title=\"\">American Pie: Reunion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/true-blood\" title=\"\">True Blood</a>'s, well, <em>different </em>family reunion this week, it's best to watch these scenes while avoiding eye contact with anyone you hope to talk to, ever.</p> <h2>Hunderby</h2> <p>We're only 18 minutes into the first episode of Hunderby before we see Alex MacQueen's newly married pastor Edmund comparing his bride Helene's pubic hair and breasts to his dead wife Arabelle's, and proceeding to set a time limit for their wedding-night intercourse. The sex is completed ahead of time, despite Helene (Alexandra Roache) pointing out he's \"not, er, in\". Edmund finishes his rutting (that's <em>rutting</em>) with a curt \"yes\", a scene made worse only by the speed with which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/julia-davis\" title=\"\">Julia Davis</a>'s Dorothy enters the room, offering \"bubbly milk\". It's a wedding night every girl can dream of.</p> <h2>True Blood</h2> <p>Not seen your sibling in ages? Do not greet her in the way that vampire Eric (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) says hello to his long-lost \"sister\" Nora \u2013 they were both turned by the same vampire \u2013 in True Blood. That's with loud, naked, incesty sex. Not only does Bill (Stephen Moyer) tell them to \"keep the noise down\", but Eric answers his phone midway though. Then they have a big old row. Not weird enough? \"We fight like siblings, but we fuck like champions,\" Eric concludes. Guys? Not cool! Christmas must be really gross round your house.</p> <h2>Fresh Meat</h2> <p>In the first episode of Channel 4's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/oct/27/fresh-meat-have-you-watched\" title=\"\">Fresh Meat</a>, Josie (Kimberley Nixon), determined to \"strap one on\" early in her first term at university, takes JP (Jack Whitehall) back to her shared house after a not-drunk-enough night down at the student union. Not only do they have to make the bed in her sparse, bare-mattressed room, but it soon becomes apparent that neither of them are that into it. \"Josie,\" asks JP after a few minutes, \"as you've got your Femidom, do you think I could take off my condom? Maybe you could \u2026 talk a bit?\" By the time Josie exhorts, \"Hump me \u2026 with your mega cock!\", we're desperate for it to end. It's all of your fears and sex insecurities, right there, on the screen.</p> <h2>Liberal Arts</h2> <p>Think back to a teacher you really fancied at school. Now imagine what he or she looks like now. Twenty years saggier than your teenage fantasy and probably still with coffee breath, right? That's exactly where Josh Radnor's 35-year-old Jesse in Liberal Arts goes wrong. Running into his favourite lecturer in a bar near his old college campus, he gets very drunk and decides that nostalgia = the horn. No! The sex is so awkward that no one bothers to fully undress, and then he refuses to leave. Jesse wants to talk books, but professor Fairfield (an amazing Allison Janney) barely waits until he's off her bed to take another sip of whisky and light a cigarette. Jesse's there, still blabbing on about books, proving that the key to a good one-night stand is leaving very quickly afterwards.</p> <h2>American Pie: Reunion</h2> <p>While American Pie's previous instalments might have been on-purpose disgusting, at least everyone was having fun. But the reunion has an air of desperation and shame hanging over every stroke. Jim (Jason Biggs), who clearly hasn't learned that when he touches a gym sock, he's moments from disaster, fires up a not-even-porn site while his wife Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) is in the bath. After mere moments (but too long to be watching a man touch himself) he's caught by his son, slams the laptop shut, and \u2026 you can guess the rest. It's funny to get caught abusing a pie by your dad at 18, but at 30, throwing a soggy sock at a one-year-old is just wrong.</p> <h2>Homeland</h2> <p>Suspected terrorist Brody (Damien Lewis) has returned to his wife Jessica (Morena Baccarin) after eight years away and things aren't exactly back on track in the bedroom. In a scene you can't unsee, Jessica tries to seduce her husband, but Brody won't let her touch him, so he angrily takes matters into his own hands. Nobody is having a nice time here, and it's awkward because it's so sad. Also: CIA agent Carrie (Claire Danes) is watching him through secret cameras, adding an extra layer of uncomfortable.</p> <h2>Louie</h2> <p>The most talked-about episode in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jul/28/louie-louis-ck-uk-tv\" title=\"\">Louis CK</a>'s third series of Louie sees him on a blind date with Laurie (Melissa Leo). When they leave in her car, she comes on to him. \"Whip it out \u2026 let me blow ya!\" she cackles. The problems start when she expects Louie to reciprocate (\"Strap on the feedbag!\"). \"Are you saying I'm a whore?\" Laurie asks. \"I don't give a shit. I just want to get off. Your sperms are dying inside my mouth right now. Where are the gentlemen?\" Then she smashes his head into the window and threatens to break his fingers. The worst date ever, in five minutes.</p> <h2>Episodes</h2> <p>Films have taught us that sex on a desk is hot. Who hasn't wanted to sweep everything off to make way for someone else's bum? Only now, instead of a shower of pens and paper, you're more likely to break \u00a34,900-worth of iPads, Macs and phones. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jun/07/episodes-tv-comedy\" title=\"\">Episodes</a>, desk sex is tricky. Married couple Beverly (Tamsin Greig) and Sean (Stephen Mangan) are working late on a writing job (sexy!), get drunk (hot!) and finally forget the whole \"she slept with Matt LeBlanc\" thing. After some awkward fumbling, it's made a bit too clear that proceedings have begun. But just seconds later, Sean finds he can't stop thinking about Beverly's betrayal and walks away, leaving her standing, half-naked, in their office. Heartbreaking. Especially as Sean was probably picturing 2012 Matt LeBlanc. Everyone knows you can only get off to late-90s Matt LeBlanc.</p> <h2>Mad Men</h2> <p>Floor sex: the most overrated sex of all time, even more than desk sex. Once you've got a carpet-burned foot, it's flip-flops for a week. Pity Mad Men's Megan Draper (Jessica Par\u00e9), because she can't wear Havianas and pass it off as Primark shoe-rub. The angry carpet sex from series five of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\" title=\"\">Mad Men</a> is uncomfortable as no one's really sure where the power lies: is Megan finally in control? Is Don? Also, we know it's 1966, but why isn't her bra more supportive?</p> <h2>Girls</h2> <p>The sex in Girls \u2013 especially between Lena Dunham's Hannah and Adam (Adam Driver) \u2013 is unsatisfying, awkward and very, very depressing. Hannah's constant commentary (\"So, I can just stay like this for a while, do I need to move forward, or \u2026 do you want me to, um \u2026\") and desperation to please, combined with Adam's weird fantasies \u2013 \"You're a heroin-addicted girl on the streets, I'm going to send you back to your parents covered in semen!\" \u2013 make you want to look away, curl your toes so hard they break, and slam your hands over your face so quickly they leave a mark. Although Adam would probably get off on that, too.</p> <h2>American Horror Story</h2> <p>Cry-wanking is pretty tough to watch at the best of times. Bus stops, McDonald's, when you've shut your boyfriend outside in the rain because you want to watch The X Factor in peace: it's not something you want shoved in your face. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jan/10/have-you-been-watching-american-horror-story\" title=\"\">American Horror Story</a>, Dylan McDermott's Ben hasn't had sex with his wife Vivien (Connie Britton) in a year, so when he sobs his way through an inconclusive wank, it's the No 1 scene you don't want to watch with your parents. Although, if you're watching American Horror Story with your parents, you're already brave or stupid.</p>",
  "<p>Violent anti-US demonstrations have erupted across Pakistan after a week of rising anger and the fateful decision by the government to declare a national day of protest against the US film that mocks Islam's prophet.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of all major cities, with many protests descending into serious unrest that killed at least 15 people, injured around 120 and did significant damage to businesses.</p> <p>In street battles across the country, protesters threw objects at police, who retaliated with teargas canisters and live rounds, mostly shot into the air.</p> <p>Three people were killed in Peshawar, close to the Afghan border, as mobs attacked buildings, including a number of cinemas that were set on fire.</p> <p>One victim was the driver of a broadcast truck owned by the television network ARY who was caught in police fire.

He called for peaceful protests, but also used language likely to inflame the many protesters who have claimed the video is part of a plot involving Jewish, Israeli and US interest.</p> <p>\"It is ironical that denial of Holocaust is considered a crime but no consideration is paid to the feelings of Muslims,\" he said. \"I hope the international community and Islamic world will be successful in preventing such things.\"</p> <p>If the intention of the government was to burnish its Islamic credentials in the runup to an election in the next six months, many protesters were not convinced.</p> <p>\"[President Asif Ali] Zardari is a man with no grace, he should resign,\" said Tabarak Lateef, a 22-year-old protester in Islamabad. \"Our rulers are traitors, they are American slaves and they should be ashamed of themselves.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not too long ago, Chris Christie, the obstreperous governor of New Jersey, liked to tout something he called a \"Jersey Comeback\". But that phrase somehow didn't make it into his keynote speech at last month's GOP convention. And no wonder: <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-16/new-jersey-jobless-rate-increases-to-35-year-high-of-9-dot-8-percent\">unemployment in the Garden State is at a 35-year high</a> of 9.8% \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm\">fourth-worst in the nation</a> \u2013 and unlike in the Rust Belt states or other hard-hit regions, in Jersey <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-is-chris-christie-the-right-messenger-for-the-gop-on-the-economy-20120817,0,5660988.story\">unemployment is still climbing</a>. Poverty rates are also at their highest in years, <a href=\"http://www.northjersey.com/news/bergen/Census_figures_show_NJ_is_hurting_.html\">according to new census figures</a>. And this week, all three of the <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2012-09-19/news/33953413_1_economic-forecast-revenue-growth-budget\">big credit rating agencies lashed</a> the state's economic performance, with S&amp;P cutting its rating to negative and warning that Christie's budget was a thing of make-believe.</p> <p>New Jersey, in fairness, is a tricky state for jobs. Many Garden State folks work in New York or Philadelphia; the state government can only do so much. But if the jobs picture is complex, the fiscal disaster is made to order in Trenton (seat of the Christie administration).</p> <p>Christie's ludicrous budget, which he touted at the convention as a model of good governance, relied on an annual growth projection of 7.2%, higher than anywhere in the nation save California. Some might call that optimistic, others downright fantastical. </p> <p>Not only is projected growth coming in below that figure, by nearly a point, but even if growth had met Christie's target, that <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-19/n-dot-j-dot-needs-8-dot-2-percent-growth-to-meet-revenue-goals-rosen-says\">would still leave the state short</a> $258m, thanks to across-the-board corporate tax cuts. There was never anything balanced about Christie's \"three balanced budgets with lower taxes\", as he called them at the convention. And Jersey, it's now clear, is not coming back from anywhere.</p> <p>The Christie juggernaut is finally facing a backlash. And so the governor's trademark petty insults are now directed not only at his political opponents, but at anyone who even mentions that things are going south. Both the media and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuA-2bJEtfQ\">Democrats are \"rooting for failure\"</a> if they point up that unemployment is up and revenues are down. And when the head of the state's nonpartisan office for budget analysis identified the massive revenue shortfall, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-05-24/christie-turns-to-name-calling-on-n-dot-j-dot-revenue-report-shortfall\">Christie responded</a> in typically furious fashion. \"Why would anyone with a functioning brain believe this guy?\" he yowled, before comparing him to Dr Kevorkian.</p> <p>To anyone surprised by Christie's absurd governance and indifference to economics, all I can say is that this is nothing new. Christie first trumpeted his arrival on the national scene by cancelling, at the height of Tea Party anti-government fervor, the largest public works project anywhere in the United States: a vital new tunnel under the Hudson River 20 years in the making. The project had already broken ground when the governor unilaterally shut it down, fearing that basic, sorely-needed infrastructure would put state taxpayers on \"a never-ending hook\". (What does a never-ending hook look like?)</p> <p>Yet, according to a report this April by the Government Accountability Office, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/nyregion/report-disputes-christies-reason-for-halting-tunnel-project-in-2010.html\">Christie had grossly exaggerated</a> New Jersey's liability for the tunnel. He said the state would have to foot 70% of the bill; it was really under 15%. The governor had railed that costs were spiraling out of control; actually, they were unchanged for several years. Naturally, though, the <a href=\"http://nation.foxnews.com/gov-chris-christie/2012/04/13/watch-full-christie-speech-gw-bush-institute\">governor was unmoved</a> by this nonpartisan budget analysis. When it comes to public works, whatever the figures say, \"no matter how much the administration yells and screams, you have to say no.\"</p> <p>It was classic Christie to couch his ruthlessness on the tunnel project in the language of \"tough calls\" and \"hard choices\" \u2013 a theme he returned to in his recent convention speech, where he laughably opined that politicians have \"become paralyzed by our desire to be loved\". To every self-serving dismissal you can trust Christie to impute the highest degree of righteousness. (In this, he has a friend in Paul Ryan, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/04/05/ryan.budget.proposal/index.html\">who likes to insist</a> that his oligarchical deception of massive tax cuts and the gutting of every public sector program outside the military is a \"moral imperative\" for \"our children and our grandchildren\".)</p> <p>But what tough call did Christie make with the Jersey cash earmarked for the tunnel? He put it into a transportation fund so he could <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/11/chris_christies_gas_tax_foolishness/\">keep the state gas tax</a> at an absurdly low rate \u2013 the third-lowest rate in the nation, less than half that of New York, and unchanged since 1988. Critically important infrastructure or a couple of pennies less on a tank of unleaded? As he says, it's a tough call.</p> <p>Enough, you might think, to make a New Jersey voter miss <a href=\"heaven_can_wait_rzIVCJVENUl8mgCezXBUCJ\">Jim McGreevey</a> and <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2002-09-30/politics/elec02.nj.s.torricelli.race_1_robert-torricelli-bradley-and-frank-lautenberg-republican-doug-forrester?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS\">Bob Toricelli</a>, the state's former champions of political malfeasance. And yet, such is the condition of American politics that this man \u2013 who, in case you forgot, also has trailing behind him the voluminous baggage of <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/chris-christies-presidential-baggage.php\">abuse of power scandals</a> that would spell doom for most politicians \u2013 remains the presumed standard-bearer for the Republican party in 2016.</p> <p>He is a smart enough political operator to know that the Romney campaign is capsizing. He denies reports that he turned down the VP slot out of fear of failure, but during his impressively self-serving keynote address at the GOP convention, he failed to mention Romney until 16 minutes into a 24-minute speech. <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/09/gov_christies_approval_rating.html\">His approval ratings remain high</a> in reliably blue territory, and more than half of New Jerseyans say their traumatized state is heading in the right direction.</p> <p>So what Christie, and we, are learning is that he doesn't need Romney or anyone else to succeed. He doesn't need to be a successful governor, or even a minimally competent one. Fill the role demanded by central casting \u2013 the hard-driving tax-slasher with no time for niceties \u2013 and there will be enough insulation, in the party and in the media, to withstand even the most dismal economic performance. He may be a bully rather than a leader, but Christie is savvy enough to know which gets to you to the top.</p>",

  "<p>The massive outpouring of anger over Troy Davis's death a year ago has not prevented other executions going ahead in the US amid considerable controversy. Here are five cases of death row prisoners who have been judicially killed over the past year, each representing a different flaw in the application of capital punishment in America today:</p> <h2>Manuel Valle</h2> <p><strong>Executed:</strong> 28 September 2011, aged 61</p> <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Cruelty of prolonged stay on death row</p> <p><strong>The case:</strong> Valle, a Cuban national who was convicted of murdering a police officer in 1978, spent 33 years on death row. During that time he was held largely in solitary confinement \u2013 conditions that it has been argued amount to cruel and unusual punishment that should be banned under the eighth amendment of the US constitution.</p> <p>The US supreme court judge, Justice Breyer, voted for a stay of execution for Valle but was outnumbered by his colleagues. Breyer <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/11-6029.pdf\">wrote a minority judgment</a> in which he said: \"I have little doubt about the cruelty of so long a period of incarceration under sentence of death.\"</p> <h2>Christopher Johnson</h2> <p><strong>Executed:</strong> 20 October 2011, aged 38</p> <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> \"Volunteer\"</p> <p><strong>The case:</strong> Johnson was one of the few prisoners who are executed every year as \"volunteers\" \u2013 that is they choose to die and waive all rights to appeal or clemency. That may sound like their right to do so, but the problem is that academic studies have found that about 80% of the volunteers show signs of serious mental illness.</p> <p>Johnson was no exception. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/21/ alabama-executes-christopher-johnson-doubts\">His childhood was troubled with psychotic episodes</a> and in prison he tried several times to kill himself. Yet his desire to be executed for having murdered in 2005 his six-month-old son was still taken by the justice system to be a sane expression of choice, and not as some experts decried a form of judicially approved suicide.</p> <h2>Edwin Turner</h2> <p><strong>Executed:</strong> 8 February 2012, aged 38</p> <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Mental illness</p> <p><strong>The case:</strong> You could tell that Turner had a history of mental illness just by looking at him \u2013 his face was terribly disfigured from a rifle bullet after he tried to shoot himself aged 18. His family also had a history of suicide attempts and <a href=\"http:// usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/02/02/10302815-too-crazy-to-kill-lawyers-try-to-stop- execution-of-inmate-they-say-is-mentally-ill\">hospitalisations for mental illness</a> that ran through both his parents and his grandmother and great-grandmother.</p> <p>There is no law in the US preventing executions for those who are mentally ill. Unless it can be proved they were insane at the moment they committed the crime, they are not exempt from the gurney.</p> <p>Despite clear evidence that Turner was ill, he was put to death for fatally shooting a clerk in 1995 during a robbery.</p> <h2>Marvin Wilson</h2> <p><strong>Executed:</strong> 7 August 2012, aged 54</p> <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Mental \"retardation\"</p> <p><strong>The case:</strong> Wilson was diagnosed as having learning difficulties \u2013 a condition still referred to by the US courts as \"retardation\". He was recorded with an IQ score of 61, putting him in the lowest percentile of the population.</p> <p>The US supreme court banned executions for people with learning difficulties in 2002. None the less, Wilson was still put to death for the 1992 murder of a police drug informant because his state, Texas, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ 2012/aug/05/texas-death-row-mentally-retarded\">applies its own definition of \"retardation\"</a> based on the character of Lennie Small in John Steinbeck's 1937 novel Of Mice and Men.</p> <h2>Daniel Cook</h2> <p><strong>Execution:</strong> 8 August 2012, aged 51</p> <p><strong>Flaw:</strong> Childhood abuse</p> <p><strong>The case:</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2012/08/ daniel_cook_convicted_murderer.php\">Cook was executed for the horrendous strangulation murders</a> of two men, one aged 16, in 1987. Though there was no doubt about the heinousness of his crimes, his lawyers argued that Cook suffered such appalling abuse as a child that he should have been shown clemency in commuting his sentence to life in prison.</p> <p>He was abused from infancy into his teenage years, including rape by his mother, step-father, foster parents, grandparents and the manager of a group home where he was resident. Expert witnesses testified at his appeal that he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the abuse, leaving him prone to wild mood swings that could have been a factor behind the murders he committed.</p>",
  "<p>For some law students, the dream of an exciting, new, high-status - if not always highly paid - job after law school is a reality but for an <a href=\"http://l2b.thelawyer.com/law-firms-predict-big-drop-in-graduate-vacancies/1013208.article\" title=\"\">increasing number</a> of others a bracing comedown awaits.</p> <p>\"After finishing bar school without a pupillage in 2009, I got a paralegal job with a car manufacturer in a town outside London. I was one of the lucky ones, with most people on my course struggling to get any sort of legal-related work,\" recalls Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) graduate Georgina Blower.</p> <p>A Legal Practice Course (LPC) graduate who has been working as a paralegal at a media company since finishing her studies this summer has had a similar experience. Speaking anonymously, she said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"At times, I can't believe I'm working in a minimum wage job having gone to law school. But it's a hell of a lot better than sitting around doing nothing.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Worse, such paralegal positions tend not to lead directly to a training contract, with large law firms favouring candidates who are still studying when they recruit (a process which typically occurs two years in advance of trainee start dates). Another anonymous LPC graduate who has been chasing a training contract for two years while working as a paralegal at a large Manchester-based firm summarised the situation like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"At any mid to large regional firm, and many national firms, paralegals number about 50-100 and they're all chasing a potential of 3-4 training contracts per year, which may go to an external applicant! It's more of an implied thing, serve your time (usually up to 3-4 years) and they'll offer you a training contract if you're good enough AND if you go through the usual training contract application/interviews procedure.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The situation is even tougher for prospective barristers, as they seek to persuade a set of chambers to take them on. Blower worked as a paralegal for a year, then completed an LLM at Cambridge University, after which she spent 12 months as a research assistant at the Law Commission, before finally bagging a pupillage at a criminal set in London, which begins next week. \"Working as a paralegal is good general experience, but in truth it's not particularly useful in terms of obtaining a pupillage,\" she adds. \"All you can do is keep stacking things in your favour and hope it all pays off.\"</p> <p>Happily, it's not all gloom for the law graduates caught out in the paralegal cold, with several decent options offering hope. The most obvious is to try and land a gig at a decent quality legal aid firm \u2013 a sector which has always been a bit more ad hoc in their recruitment style.</p> <p>At top human rights outfit Bindmans, for example, a stint as a paralegal is compulsory in order to be considered for a training contract. The firm's human resources manager Nicola O'Shea explains: \"While it depends on the department, we typically expect 12 months work as a paralegal. The majority of paralegals we take on get one of the approximately six training contracts we offer each year.\"</p> <p>Other firms specialising in publicly-funded work operate similarly \u2013 although they don't always pay their paralegals. Indeed, some expect their paralegals to pay out large sums to fund <a href=\"http://www.legalcheek.com/2012/05/named-the-law-firm-requiring-grads-to-self-fund-a-9-5k-paralegal-training-course-before-theyre-considered-for-a-tc/\" title=\"\">expensive additional paralegal training courses</a>.</p> <p>Another possibility is taking advantage of a new trainee recruitment agency model that is being developed with the aim of hooking top graduates who have slipped through the traditional recruitment net. Susan Cooper, the ex-City lawyer who runs Accutrainee \u2013 which recruits jobless LPC graduates, then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/sep/29/cut-price-traineeship-law-graduates\" title=\"\">loans them out</a> to short-staffed law firms, where they complete their training contracts \u2013 urges paralegals with sparkling CVs \"not to lose heart\". She continues: \"Law firms are increasingly realising that they are missing out on some exceptional candidates and are beginning to become more flexible in the way they recruit graduates.\"</p> <p>A tip for succeeding in the hyper-competitive world of the bar, is \"a willingness to think outside the box\", says Aiden Brindley, the head of pre-qualification barrister recruitment firm Baby Barristers. Brindley recommends trying to land a paralegal position at a law firm where there is a practising in-house barrister on the books who may be able to act as their pupil master. \"Graduates often forget that they can do their pupillage in-house \u2013 but only if the law firm has a barrister to supervise them, with solicitors unable to act as pupil masters,\" he explains.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest cause for optimism, though, is that the panel behind the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/13/reviewing-legal-education\" title=\"\">ongoing legal education and training review (LETR)</a> \u2013 representing potentially the biggest shake-up of legal education in three decades \u2013 is <a href=\"http://www.legalcheek.com/2012/07/a-neat-solution-to-the-legal-education-and-training-puzzle/\" title=\"\">considering allowing paralegals to qualify</a> as lawyers directly without having to do a pupillage or training contract. A final report will be made by the LETR early next year. Those who find themselves stuck in the paralegal holding pattern will be awaiting its recommendations with interest.</p> <p><em>Alex Aldridge is the editor of </em><a href=\"http://www.legalcheek.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Legal Cheek</em></a></p>",
  "<p>It's time for our weekly roundup of the best new iPhone and iPad apps, following a bustling week on the App Store.</p> <p>As usual, games aren't included, because they get their own separate post.

Armed with a maddeningly-catchy tune (already separately <a href=\"http://www.appsplayground.com/apps/2012/09/20/like-the-toca-band-song-its-on-itunes-and-spotify/\">available on iTunes and Spotify</a>), it's joyful fun for children and parents alike.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/amazon-cloud-player/id510855668?mt=8\">Amazon Cloud Player</a></h2> <p>As on Android, this isn't a new app, since it's been out in the US for a while, but it's brand new to the UK. Amazon launched its Cloud Player service earlier in the week, enabling people to play songs they've stored in Amazon's music locker service or bought from its MP3 store. The iPhone client is a solid first effort, including downloading as well as streams.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/scape/id506703636?mt=8\">Scape</a></h2> <p>Musicians Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers previously worked together on innovative music app Bloom, but Scape is their follow-up. Promising to \"make music that thinks for itself\", it's a \"new form of album\" that gets you to play with the music and its elements, without any actual musical ability required. 15 scenes (or \"Scapes\") are included, providing plenty of variety.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/skitch/id490505997?mt=8\">Skitch for iPhone</a></h2> <p>Evernote's Skitch app has been available on iPad for some time, but now it's out for iPhone too.

The app can be used to create digital paintings at resolutions up to 2048x2048, with a wide variety of brushes and export options.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/finding-nemo-storybook-deluxe/id545813738?mt=8\">Finding Nemo: Storybook Deluxe</a></h2> <p>Good news for parents whose kids can't get enough of Disney's fishy classic. Just in time for its 3D reworking, Finding Nemo has been turned into an iOS storybook-app, using voice narration from the original actors, and adding puzzles, painting and a mode where your child talks to Dory the whale, and hears their words translated into whale language.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/letters-with-pooh/id535661652?mt=8\">Letters with Pooh</a></h2> <p>Talking of familiar Disney characters... The company's new Winnie the Pooh app isn't a book: it's an educational tool. Focused on the alphabet, it teaches children to recognise, write and say their letters, with digital stickering and plenty of honey wrapped around the core activities.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/blood-ivory-special-report/id561743613?mt=8\">Blood Ivory - A Special Report</a></h2> <p>25,000 elephants were killed last year for their ivory, according to National Geographic. To raise awareness of issues around the ivory trade, it's released a free iPad app presenting its report, with additional video and interactive maps.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/paddy-power-premier-league/id525969522?mt=8\">Paddy Power Premier League</a></h2> <p>Bookmaker Paddy Power's new release is a second-screen app focusing on the English Premier League, providing scores, stats, news and team profiles. The clever feature comes when users point their device at the TV when watching a match, and tap a TV Bet button to get betting odds on that game.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fantasy-premier-league-2012/id552314764?mt=8\">Fantasy Premier League 2012/13</a></h2> <p>Apps seem to be turning up in pairs this week. This is the official iOS app for the official Fantasy Premier League competition in England, which apparently has more than 2.5m players. The app helps players pick their teams, check their points totals and make transfers.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dr.-seuss-bookshelf/id543665995?mt=8\">Dr. Seuss Bookshelf</a></h2> <p>Publisher Oceanhouse Media has turned pretty much every Dr. Seuss book into an app since the launch of Apple's App Store. Now it has a separate app to keep track of them all, providing one place from which to launch the apps that people own, as well as recommendations for the ones that they don't.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/livestream-for-producers/id493086499?mt=8\">Livestream for Producers</a></h2> <p>Livestream is one of the companies helping people \u2013&#xa0;including music artists and webcasters \u2013&#xa0;to broadcast live video online.

Flipboard, for one. This wants to get people creating their own topic-based news channels pulling articles in from the web, and then sharing those channels with their friends.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pregnancy-by-bounty/id560102929?mt=8\">Pregnancy by Bounty</a></h2> <p>British parenting club Bounty is also taking to the App Store with an app for pregnant women, explaining the process, providing a journal for them to track their own pregnancy, a due-date calculator and sponsored tips and videos.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/icc-cricket/id557159946?mt=8\">ICC Cricket</a></h2> <p>In perfect time for the World Twenty20 tournament, this is the official app of the International Cricket Council.

Aimed at \"children and inquisitive adults of all ages\", it gets people to take a photo of something nearby, then turn it into a rotating tile-puzzle for someone else to solve. Inventive and fun.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tunepad/id556683901?mt=8\">TunePad</a></h2> <p>It's not just Brian Eno looking to get iOS users making beautiful music. TunePad is the work of developer GearSprout, and is the latest grid-based music tool on the App Store, blending beats and melodies by drawing on the screen. A \"Tune Pack\" is available through in-app purchase, with more presumably to come.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/visuamusio/id556825102?mt=8\">Visuamusio</a></h2> <p>And here's more music-making, courtesy of Wow.inc. This is as much focused on visuals as music, as you drop geometric shapes onto the screen to create different sounds and melodies.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/spoonbill-for-app.net/id553799155?mt=8\">Spoonbill for App.net</a></h2> <p>The App.net clients are flowing onto the App Store, with Spoonbill the best-looking way so far to access entrepreneur Dalton Caldwell's Twitter-alternative. A lot of effort has clearly gone into the user interface, including keeping things clutter-free. It reminds me \u2013 not in looks, necessarily, but in ethos \u2013&#xa0;of early Tweetie, the app that went on to be bought by Twitter as the basis for its official iOS app.</p> <p>That's our selection, now how about yours?

This month the capital, Delhi, brought in its own ban, following 11 other states.</p> <p>According to the most recent government figures as many as 200 million people use some form of chewed tobacco, more than twice as many as smoke. Defenders say gutka is part of the centuries-old local practice of chewing mild stimulants, introduced by the Mughal emperors. To its critics, it is a major health risk created by unregulated mass production and marketing.</p> <p>Explaining her decision to end its sale and production in the city, the chief minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit, called gutka a \"very serious health hazard\".</p> <p>Campaigners and senior officials hope that, despite lobbying by manufacturers, a nationwide ban can be imposed.</p> <p>\"We are liaising with states and central government and trying for a total ban. If it doesn't work we will go to the courts wherever necessary. We are optimistic,\" said Dr Ravikant Singh, president of Doctors For You, an NGO which has petitioned courts for the change.</p> <p>One major concern has been the number of teenagers and even children developing gutka habits. Though the law forbids its sale close to schools or colleges, such restrictions are widely flouted.</p> <p>There are fears that the new ban will also be ineffective.</p> <p>\"The law is difficult to enforce and so we need public education campaigns too. You cannot drive away anything that is a custom overnight. It has to become a social evil,\" Professor GK Rath, a leading Indian cancer expert, said.</p> <p>Outside the cancer wing of the All India Institute of Medical Science, in south Delhi, hundreds milled around hoping for a bed last week. The wing has only room for 182 inpatients but is one of the best equipped in the country.</p> <p>Rath, who runs the centre, said that around a quarter of oral cancer cases that he sees can be attributed to gutka or similar products. The mix of tobacco with other substances \u2013 such as crushed areca nut, the leaf of the betel plant and lime \u2013 is a \"deadly combination\", he told the Guardian, with the lime eroding the mouth and throat.</p> <p>Saliva containing chewed gutka is so corrosive that engineers have been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/26/spit-threatens-indian-bridge\" title=\"\">forced to launch structural surveys of the famous Howrah bridge</a> in Kolkata after the accumulated spit of millions began to eat into its girders.</p> <p>\"It's like a drug. You just can't stop. If I could have my time again I would never start,\" said Sachin Goel, 36, who had much of his jaw and throat removed after doctors found an advanced cancer.</p> <p>Manufacturers argue that banning gutka \u2013 a \"homegrown\" industry which they say provides hundreds of thousands with a living \u2013 but not cigarettes makes no sense.</p> <p>\"Gutka is the luxury of the poor. They will just turn to cigarettes or country-made hooch instead,\" said Sanjay Bechan, of the Indian Smokeless Tobacco Federation. \"I should have a choice as an Indian.</p> <p>We are not living in a banana republic. The only people benefiting from this will be some multinationals who sell cigarettes.\"</p> <p>The government figures show that nearly two in five (38%) adults in rural areas and one in four (25%) adults in urban areas use tobacco in some form. Most gutka firms are family-run enterprises.</p> <p>\"The industry is obviously going to shut down completely,\" said Maha Dev, of Som Fragrances, a gutka factory in Delhi founded 25 years ago. \"It's a government policy so there's nothing we can do or say.\"</p> <p>Campaigners believe that the substantial donations made by gutka manufacturers to politicians may protect them in some parts of India.</p> <p>\"We will need strong action by the courts there. The politicians won't introduce a ban by themselves,\" said Dr Ravi Kant, the campaigner.</p> <p>The sellers who make a living from hawking the gutka appear resigned to the change. Ravi Shukla has sold gutka, cigarettes and soft drinks from a stall in Delhi's Saket neighbourhood for a decade.

  "<p>David Cameron has visited Manchester to pay his respects to two police officers who were shot dead in the line of duty earlier this week.</p> <p>During a visit to Greater Manchester police headquarters, two miles from the city centre, the prime minister said: \"I think the whole country is profoundly shocked by what has happened and it is right we praise the work that they did and remember all they have done.</p> <p>\"I think it is also important that the government makes sure that it is doing everything it can to help the Greater Manchester police force tackle organised crime and gang-related violence, and I think that is an important conversation and important work to be done too.\"</p> <p>On Friday morning the man accused of murdering the officers as well as a father and son <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/21/dale-cregan-court-police-murder\" title=\"\">made a two-minute court appearance in Manchester</a> amid tight security.</p> <p>Armed officers were in the city's magistrates court as Dale Cregan, 29, of no fixed address, appeared in the dock in a dark blue sweatshirt and tracksuit bottoms, with a full beard and wearing a black onyx false eye to replace his missing left eye. He was led into the dock of the packed courtroom flanked by four police officers, while two more officers dressed in military-style fatigues and armed with machine guns stood outside the dock and two armed officers seated in the public gallery. Armed officers could be seen in offices overlooking the court building.</p> <p>Cregan appeared before district judge Jonathan Taaffe charged with the murder of constables Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, on Tuesday at the Hattersley estate in Mottram, Tameside. The officers were killed in a shooting and grenade attack as they responded to a routine burglary report. Cregan is also charged with the murders of David and Mark Short, and the attempted murder of four other people who were either injured or present during the separate attacks on the father and son.</p> <p>Cregan sat down briefly after he was led into the dock, but stood up when asked to do so by Taaffe. The defendant spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth to the packed courtroom. Observers in the court said Cregan yawned before the charges were put to him, and then stood with his hands placed in front of his body.</p> <p>Mark Short, 23, died from a gunshot wound to his neck after a gunman entered a pub and opened fire at around 11.50pm at the Cotton Tree Inn in Droylsden, Tameside, on 25 May. Cregan is also accused of the attempted murders of Michael Belcher, Ryan Pridding and John Short, who were in the pub at the time.</p> <p>On 10 August the victim's father, David, 46, died in a grenade and gun attack on his home in Clayton, Manchester. Less than 10 minutes later there was another grenade explosion less than half a mile away in Droylsden. Cregan faces a further charge of attempted murder of Sharon Hark arising from the incidents on that day.</p> <p>Relatives of the Short family sat in the public gallery on Friday, one wearing a grey, hooded sweatshirt with photographs of Mark Short on it and \"RIP Mark Short\" in blue letters.</p> <p>Taaffe read out the eight charges against Cregan and said that they were so serious they could only be dealt with in a higher court. The case was automatically sent to Manchester crown court for a further hearing on Monday.</p> <p>\"You will be remanded into custody until that time, please go with the officers,\" the judge told Cregan.</p> <p>There was no application for bail by Cregan's solicitor, David Caplin.</p> <p>Taaffe reminded the media that it was \"an extremely sensitive case\" and called for it to be reported responsibly.</p> <p>Thousands of people have signed a book of condolence set up by Greater Manchester police paying tribute to the officers, and flowers have been left at the scene by wellwishers.</p> <p>A postmortem examination concluded the officers had died of gunshot wounds.</p> <p>On Thursday Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan urged two east Manchester crime families to end their feud, saying \"enough is enough\".</p>",
  "<p>Towards the end of their acting careers and particularly in cameo roles, Peter Lorre and the theatrical knights Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud perfected the art of scene stealing, throwing in improvised lines designed to disconcert, flamboyantly drifting off their marks to hog the shot or generally \"chewing the scenery\". In football the master of limelight larceny, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, needs no such tricks. Pitting the Portuguese and his team against the world is a familiar pre-match ploy and when vindication comes, he expresses his euphoria physically.</p> <p>On Tuesday night, however, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/18/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league\" title=\"\">when celebrating Cristiano Ronaldo's late, dramatic winner</a> against Manchester City with the knee-slide once-favoured by Billy Bremner and revived by Didier Drogba he seemed even more delirious. In the past at times there has been an element of calculation about it but this was spontaneous, probably tinged with relief after beginning the week by criticising some of his squad and changing the team.</p> <p>This was more Mourinho <em>contra mundum</em> than any match preceding it, about his judgment and methods as much as his team's. His exceptional gift as a manager has been to make his words sound like war drums in players' ears and having gone out on a limb following his side's patchy start to the season Ronaldo's goal triggered a war cry from him that was part triumph, a natural reaction when a game's carefully laid rhythm explodes in the last 15 minutes and you ultimately emerge unscathed, and part defiance of the&#xa0;doubters.</p> <p>He also trashed a decent suit, his grass-stained trousers looking like the evidence of guilt of a guest who got lucky at a garden party. His previous highlights did not offend his tailor though they did antagonise a wider audience. In 2004, when Porto went ahead late in the tie against Manchester United in the Champions League round of 16, he scampered up the Old Trafford touchline, hopping, skipping and jumping with his arms spread into a Y-shape.</p> <p>At Internazionale in October 2009, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK3LPJUldxA\" title=\"\">Mourinho celebrated Wesley Sneijder's injury-minute winner</a> against Udinese with his tongue out and rolling his fists as if he were preceding the funky chicken move in The Hustle. Even the club's president, Massimo Moratti, said: \"It was a bit strange but the important thing is that we won.\" When Inter prevailed over the defending champions, Barcelona, in the European Cup semi-final the same season, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsaAbuGtmz4\" title=\"\">he shot off across the Camp Nou pitch, one arm outstretched with his index finger pointing to the sky</a> <em>\u00e0 la</em> Denis Law and with a look of justification on his face that brought to mind Brian Glover's smirk in Kes when Mr Sugden converts his respotted penalty. Mourinho even ended his spree with Bar\u00e7a's keeper, V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s, in his face. He breaches the manager's accepted etiquette repeatedly, but that very lack of decorum is an essential part of the bond he makes between himself and his clubs' fans.</p> <p>\"After playing football, there's nothing like it again,\" said Kevin Keegan last year. \"Management is a pale attempt to hang on to the excitement.\" Yet Mourinho did not enjoy a stellar career, something he has in common with almost all of us. For him management is the excitement and the manner in which it captivates him would be the same for the broad majority who only watch him.</p> <p>Other managers' repertoires are more limited. Even in 1993 when Manchester United were wobbling against Sheffield Wednesday on their way to winning their first title since 1967, it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQiE3Ia7Rw\" title=\"\">Brian Kidd</a> who provided a more memorable image than his boss. The assistant encroached on to the pitch, flung himself in the air and dropped to his knees when Steve Bruce scored the decisive goal that was so late it was almost posthumous. Sir Alex Ferguson at that moment was enraptured but did not cross the line. Now he confines himself to the arms aloft shuffle characterised as a \"dad dance\", but I&#xa0;prefer to see that as a homage to Michael Douglas's seduction scene in the disco in Basic Instinct, albeit with less garish knitwear.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m0qTKP39gg\" title=\"\">Bob Stokoe </a>was the first manager I saw getting carried away by the emotion of victory when he ran across Wembley in his trilby, gabardine and tracksuit when Sunderland beat Leeds in the 1973 FA Cup final. It took a decade for anyone to seem so similarly intoxicated by the moment that their inhibitions were cast aside as if transported by rapture. Manchester City supporters again had to look on at a blithe spirit in 1983 when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MZPl3pMozw\" title=\"\">David Pleat </a>did his audition for Watership Down at Maine Road while wearing Richie Benaud's cast-off clobber&#xa0;to greet Luton Town's survival at City's expense.</p> <p>It is galling when you are on the receiving end but better an engaged manager by far than one of the growing band of scribblers who, like earnest gallery visitors, spend more time taking notes than looking at what they are there to see. It should not take Mourinho to show them how to enjoy themselves.</p>",
  "<p>More than 4 million people are tuning in to Paul O'Grady's new primetime ITV show For the Love of Dogs every week. We sob at the stories of Battersea dogs abused and abandoned, and smile as we see them rehomed \u2013 we are, after all, a nation of dog lovers. Or are we?</p> <p>Linda Goodman is a truly committed dog lover. So much so that, in an attempt to draw attention to the plight of battery-farmed dogs, she has chosen to live like a breeding bitch. A live webcam has been <a href=\"http://veetle.com/index.php/channel/view#5051a84562e74\" title=\"\">filming her suffering</a> for five days so far. Click and take a look: a sad sight, isn't it? But so far, very few people have paid her much attention. If O'Grady were stuck in a cowshed for a week, perhaps the press would take an interest.</p> <p>If For the Love of Dogs shows us the end of the story, Goodman's webcam shows us the beginning. When we talk of puppy farming, you might imagine it could be quite picturesque \u2013 adorable photogenic pups gamboling in paddocks. But it's actually grotesque.</p> <p>There are estimated to be 5,500 breeding bitches living in council-approved licensed kennels in just three counties of Wales. They will never know the love of a human being, never sit on a sofa, go for a walk or play fetch or have that spot on their tummies tickled that will make their back leg twitch. Enslaved to a breeding schedule, they're just locked in a barn for years and years, left to stand in their own mess \u2013 often in the dark \u2013 until their litter size falls to an unprofitable size, at which point they are put to sleep.</p> <p>Why? Because we buy their pups. Their misery will continue until the trade is either banned or it becomes unprofitable.</p> <p>The poor pups, meanwhile, are destined for dealers and pet shops. It's a lottery where they end up. And it's a gamble if they even survive the journey or their first few weeks. The life of a battery-farmed dog is cheap. Their poor rearing, lack of socialisation and lack of health tests can make them expensive for their owners, though. If they care enough to spend the cash of course: god help the puppy who was put on Gumtree and swapped for a pair of trainers, as happened to one Jack Russell last week.</p> <p>And yet perfectly sensible people look a wormy, sickly pet shop pup in the eye and hand over the money. They tell themselves they're \"rescuing\" it from the next person, someone who might not be able to properly care for it. But their money is blood-stained, no matter how good their intentions. Without profit there's no motivation for anyone to intensively farm dogs.</p> <p>Perfectly awful people buy these pups, too, and then start up their own dodgy backyard breeding businesses.</p> <p>The Kennel Club estimates one in five of us have bought a puppy-farmed dog. Linda in the shed knows all this. That's why she's locked herself in.</p> <p>You can educate people not to buy puppy farmed dogs until you're dog-tired, but as soon as they see a pup their brains turns to mush.</p> <p>So what can you do to get Goodman and all those poor dogs out of the shed? Write to your MP. Tell them to stop licensing misery. Ask them to tax bad breeding, and to bring in an enforceable puppy contract that would give existing consumer law some teeth. And resist the temptation of that puppy in the window, so that it becomes unprofitable to trade in misery.</p>",
  "<p>If you're a headteacher whose school is being forced to make the switch to sponsored academy status, you probably assume that all staff jobs are covered by <a href=\"http://www.cipd.co.uk/hr-resources/factsheets/transfer-of-undertakings-tupe.aspx\" title=\"\">Tupe</a>, legislation that guarantees the terms and conditions of existing employees. But when you meet the broker employed by the Department for Education to discuss the transfer, you may be in for a shock.</p> <p>\"We're being told directly by heads that DfE brokers are saying Tupe legislation doesn't apply to them, that a different job of principal would be created in the new academy, and that it would be advertised nationally,\" says Rob Kelsall, senior regional officer at the <a href=\"http://www.naht.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Association for Head Teachers</a> (NAHT).</p> <p>\"We've got heads who have been terrified not only by the thought of academy conversion being forced on their school but also that they do not feature in the future of that school.\"</p> <p>In one meeting between the headteacher of a primary in the north of England and DfE brokers, the senior leadership team was given advice that the NAHT says is unlawful and could lead to expensive industrial tribunals.</p> <p>In minutes of the meeting seen by the Guardian, the DfE broker explains that it's up to the sponsor to decide whether a headteacher is transferred as principal to the new academy. The rationale is that the role of principal is so different to that of headteacher that advertising the job is justified, should the sponsor choose to go down this route.</p> <p>Interestingly, it is also suggested by the DfE broker that it may not be in the best financial interests of a head to transfer to the academy. As a new principal, he or she would be rigorously performance-monitored and if it were subsequently decided that the person wasn't up to scratch in the new position, a compromise agreement with accompanying financial package pre-Tupe transfer would not be offered.</p> <p>This is not an isolated instance. Kelsall says that several headteachers have raised the same concern. His colleague, Ian Coupe, based in the west of England, explains that with one head he is advising, the DfE broker has \"virtually come in and said 'You don't have a job'.\"</p> <p>DfE brokers may be advising heads that their jobs are on the line, but it seems that academy sponsors \u2013 the employers of new academy staff \u2013 interpret Tupe legislation in an interesting variety of ways.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.harrisfederation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Harris Federation</a>, which from this month has 19 academy schools, says it works by the principle that Tupe legislation applies to all staff including the headteacher. So far, however, all but two of the heads in local authority schools which transferred under Harris sponsorship, have automatically become principals. The exceptions are a new free school and a head who resigned before the switch.</p> <p>But other sponsors take a different view. At <a href=\"http://www.oasiscommunitylearning.org/\" title=\"\">Oasis Community Learning</a>, which has 14 academies, spokesman Gary Streeter confirms that Oasis does require headteachers \"to reapply for their jobs\", unlike all other staff who are automatically transferred across.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.arkschools.org/\" title=\"\">Ark Schools</a>, with 11 academies, spokeswoman Lesley Smith says that heads \"have precisely the same rights [under Tupe as other staff],\" but then goes on to say, \"but there tends to be a conversation, particularly with the senior leadership team as the role changes\".</p> <p>Most worrying for heads is the response from <a href=\"http://www.e-act.org.uk/\" title=\"\">E-ACT</a>, a not-for-profit company that runs 27 academies and two free schools. Christine Lynch, its head of human resources, says that \"from a statutory point of view, in the transfer of any employee, the transferees carrying on the same business are Tupe-transferred.\"</p> <p>However she continues by saying: \"Where we'd have areas of variation around that is where we'd be saying to our academy principals that they come as new appointees. So our view on this is it's not quite the same in the case of the principal.\"</p> <p>Lynch suggests that the role of principal in a new academy is sufficiently different from that of headteacher and that it may require a different skillset . This means that when E-ACT sponsors a new academy, it advertises the role of principal, and \"we do go through a very rigorous selection process.\"</p> <p>Although Lynch says that in the three years that E-ACT has been running academies, all headteachers bar one (who did not reapply for the role of principal) have been transferred across, the NAHT's Kelsall says this misses the point completely.</p> <p>\"From our perspective,\" he says, \"we're seeing this as people trying to find a way round the legislation.\"</p> <p>Kelsall notes that <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/tupe\" title=\"\">guidance</a> on the BIS (<a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Department for Business, Innovation and Skills</a>) website says: \"The new employer cannot pick and choose which employees to take on. It follows that they cannot terminate contracts and dismiss employees just because the transfer has occurred.\"</p> <p>So are headteachers protected under Tupe or aren't they? Unfortunately for anyone involved, it seems that the department for education and business are contradicting each other.</p> <p>In an attempt to clarify matters, the NAHT's lawyers have written to the Department for Education to explain that Tupe applies to every member of staff including heads. They say that their understanding of the law means that, \"even where an economic, technical or organisational reason entailing changes to the workforce exists, dismissal may still be considered unfair, and in the rare circumstances where there is a substantial change of role during conversion, the employer still has a duty to take reasonable steps to avoid redundancy and operate a fair selection process.\"</p> <p>But the DfE seems to be keeping its options open. In a statement to the Guardian, it says: \"Headteachers are able to retain their existing terms and conditions when they transfer to the same role in an academy. Some academies advertise for an academy principal, which is a different role with a much broader remit. Headteachers may chose to apply for this position.\"</p> <p>It hardly offers unqualified reassurance that all headteachers will be protected. Until the two Whitehall departments sort out who's right on Tupe, it seems that heads who are told they must transfer to a sponsored academy will still have to wonder if the knock on the door from a DfE broker means that their job is for the chop.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2012. The original stated that E-Act runs 15 academies when it actually runs 27 academies and two free schools.</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Art looks set to imitate life as Roman Polanski prepares to direct his wife in a film about a director's shifting, compromised relationship with his muse. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2012/apr/13/peep-show-theatre-audiences\" title=\"\">Venus in Fur</a>, adapted from the Tony award-winning stage-play by David Ives, will star <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0782561/\" title=\"\">Emmanuelle Seigner</a> as Vanda, the apparently fragile actor who auditions for a role in a sadomasochistic drama. French actor Louis Garrel has signed on to play the director.</p> <p>Polanski's version of Venus in Fur will relocate the action from New York to Paris, the director's regular base since he fled the US in 1978. \"I've been looking for a chance to make a film in French with Emmanuelle for a long time,\" he said in a statement. \"Reading Venus in Fur, I realised the moment had arrived.\"</p> <p>Seigner, 46, has previously worked with Polanski on Frantic, Bitter Moon and The Ninth Gate.</p> <p>Polanski's film credits include Repulsion, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown and the Oscar-winning Holocaust drama The Pianist.

  "<p>As the new school year approaches in Mali, it is looking increasingly unlikely that hundreds of schools across the Islamist-controlled north that have been closed for several months will be reopening soon.</p> <p>Thousands of children have had their last school year ruined. When the rebel Tuareg MNLA took over the towns of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu at the beginning of 2012, classes had already been disrupted by teachers on a prolonged strike. Then fighting broke out between the MNLA and Islamist rebels from AQMI, Ansar Dine and MUJAO, and schools were closed and parents kept their children away for safety. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/30/mali-adultery-stoning-radical-islamists\" title=\"\">The victorious Islamists went on to declare that they would impose sharia law</a> across the north, and called for the introduction of Qur'anic schools where girls and boys could not be taught together.</p> <p>Although a new national government was named by Mali's president, Dioncounda Traor\u00e9, in August, the new education ministry has so far been unable to do much to get children back in class.</p> <p>\"This is having an enormous impact on the children psychologically, and on the whole country. How can we train the next generation?\" says Maiga Dramane, head of basic education at the ministry of education. \"But how do you expect us to persuade someone who is pointing an AK47 at us that they should reopen a school?\"</p> <p>In addition to the closed schools, thousands of people have fled from the north \u2013 latest figures suggest at least 174,000 people have been internally displaced and more than 200,000 are in refugee camps in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/12/mali-refugees-burkina-faso-food-crisis\" title=\"\">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2012/aug/15/niger-mali-refugee-crisis-video\" title=\"\">Niger</a> and Mauritania, all with little access to educational opportunities.</p> <p>But a few children have reached the capital, Bamako, and are now benefiting from remedial classes organised by Unicef and the Malian government. An estimated 12,000 displaced people are now living with their extended families in Bamako, and the classes are to support those young people who were supposed to sit their exams in the school year ending in July. The government has promised to make provisions for them to sit exams in October.</p> <p>\"When I heard about these new sessions I was in Mauritania, but I told my family I was going to Bamako,\" says 19-year-old Lala Zeinab Elmouany, originally from Timbuktu. \"All I was thinking about was my exams. I'd worked so hard and you can't get anywhere in life without them. I want to get to university. I only had a few weeks of study this year. I've forgotten so much. I will do my best to pass my exams.\"</p> <p>Many teachers from the north have also fled south, forced out by the Islamists because they were employed by the state to teach a secular curriculum. \"They hate the public school system, so what can I do? I can't teach the Qur'an, I'm classically trained,\" says Souleymane Maiga, who was teaching physics and chemistry in Timbuktu. \"I had to leave, but then all the teachers have come here. I'm not expecting to find another job.\"</p> <p>Mali already has a poor education record. According to the UN children's fund, Unicef, adult literacy rates for 15 to 24-year-olds are 47% for men and 31% for women. Thousands of children, especially girls, barely make it through primary school. Most wealthy parents send their children to private schools where fees can be upwards of $1,000 a year.</p> <p>\"The closure of these schools in the north just compounds an already difficult situation and places extra strain on the system, particularly with the suspension of aid after the military coup in March by some donors,\" says Euphrates Gobina, Unicef's head of education in Bamako. \"We're only reaching a small number of children so far, those in grades 1 to 8 [childen aged five to 15] are not getting anything at the moment.\"</p> <p>There seems little prospect of the lost territory in the north being regained soon. Mali's president has formally requested the regional grouping, the Economic Community Of West African States, to send a force to assist Mali's army in that task, but the issue remains deeply divisive among Malians and some of the soldiers behind March's coup have said they will not accept foreign forces on Malian soil.</p>",

  "<p>John Keats, the poet of \"beauty\", a devotee of aesthetic isolation who swooned at the thought of his so-called \"bright star\" Fanny Brawne and succumbed to TB when he was 25, was an opium addict.</p> <p>The claim is made in a new biography, to be published on Monday, by Prof Nicholas Roe, chair of the <a href=\"http://keatsfoundation.com/\" title=\"\">Keats Foundation</a> and a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</p> <p>Roe admits his finding will be contentious. \"This has never been said before: Keats as an opium addict is new,\" he said.</p> <p>Roe, professor of English literature at the University of St Andrews, dismisses other experts who have previously concluded that Keats only briefly experimented with the drug. The former poet laureate Andrew Motion, winner of the Whitbread prize for biography and author of a biography of the poet, has, said Roe, made \"assumptions\" about Keats and his use of opiates that \"simply have no warrant\".</p> <p>\"Andrew Motion's line was that [Keats' close friend] Charles Brown warned Keats about the 'danger of such a habit' and asked Keats to promise 'never to take another drop without [his] knowledge',\" said Roe. \"But on no evidence that I can find, Motion surmises that 'Keats did as he was told',\" said Roe.</p> <p>\"My biography takes the contrary view that the spring of 1819 was not only one of Keats's most productive periods but also his most heavily opiated. He continued dosing himself to relieve his chronically sore throat; and that opium-induced mental instability helps to explain his jealous and vindictive mood swings regarding Fanny Brawne,\" Roe added. Motion said he has \"admiring feelings\" about Roe's book, which he has read, and agreed it is \"possible that [Roe] is right about this even though I said differently in my book\".</p> <p>However, he added, \"it is quite striking that there is no hard evidence in the letters of Keats or his friends, as there is in those of Coleridge\".</p> <p>Motion also said that because Keats \u2013 who \"by that kiss\" vowed \"an endless bliss\"\u2013 had briefly taken laudanum in his youth and had seen the effect of it on others when he was a medical student, \"it's not beyond the bounds of possibility that he explored [the effect of the drug in his poems] from these remembered experiences rather than from a full-on vantage point. \"Nick is making assumptions, just as I made assumptions,\" he said. \"That's all we can do, because there is no hard evidence either way.\"</p> <p>But Roe said he is convinced that Keats' most famous poems, Ode on Indolence and Ode to a Nightingale, arose from opium reveries. \"This explodes entrenched conceptions of him as a delicate, overly sensitive, tragic figure,\" said Roe. \"That Keats was using opium to enhance what it meant to 'fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget' the world gives us a different Keats: a Keats whose struggle with life was more complex, and darker than we have previously thought.</p> <p>\"Keats's odes of spring 1819 have often been read as his most 'philosophical' engagement with the intractable contraries of beauty and mortality, time and eternity,\" added Roe. \"To find those two odes and, I suspect, La Belle Dame sans Merci, arose from opium reveries gives us a less intellectual or 'philosophical' Keats, and a poet who is closer to the mystical aspects of Romantic tradition associated with Blake, Baudelaire, Coleridge, De Quincey, Yeats, Huxley and Bob Dylan.\"</p> <p>In his book John Keats, published by Yale University Press, Roe claims that \"to be 'half in love with easeful death',\" as Keats wrote in Ode to a Nightingale, is the hallmark of the confirmed addict.</p> <p>Roe maintains that Keats, a trained physician, gained access to laudanum in the autumn of 1818 while administering the drug to his brother.</p> <p>Tom was dying of TB, the disease he gave to Keats and of which the poet died three years later. Opium was the only painkiller that could alleviate the young man's pain.</p> <p>After his brother's death, Keats began taking the drug regularly \"to keep up his spirits\", as Brown said later. Brown warned him of the \"danger of such a habit\". This, said Roe, \"suggests Keats was indeed an 'habitual' user of opium and had been dosing himself for a considerable time.\"</p> <p>Roe believes Keats's poem Ode on Indolence was written during an opium addiction that, he said, \"was as intense as ST Coleridge's\".</p> <p>\"When Keats writes in Ode to a Nightingale of having 'emptied some dull opiate to the drains' he means \u2013 very precisely \u2013 downing a decanter of laudanum,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Like Coleridge's Kubla Khan and like Thomas de Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, Ode to a Nightingale is one of the greatest re-creations of a drug-inspired dream-vision in English literature \u2013 a poem that frankly admits his own opium habit.\"</p> <p>Ode on Indolence, added Roe: \"grew out of a reverie induced by taking laudanum to ease the pain of a black eye, got while playing cricket on Hampstead Heath in March 1819\".</p> <p>Keats's continued use of opium is, Roe claimed, \"apparent from his up and down moods, and the increasing turmoil of his relationship with Fanny Brawne in 1820, a phase of his life that resembles Coleridge's opiated anguish over his unrequited passion for Wordsworth's sister-in-law, Sara Hutchinson, in the years 1802 to 1804\".</p> <p>He added: \"The final, tragic twist of this story [comes] when Keats and the young painter Joseph Severn were voyaging to Naples, en route, they hoped, to find a cure for Keats's TB.\"</p> <p>On the trip, Severn refused to let Keats take laudanum and hid the bottle. \"As a result, Keats endured the protracted suffering of pulmonary consumption and faced his death without the panacea that had helped his brother and called into being some of the greatest poetry in the language,\" said Roe.</p> <p>Richard Holmes, author of The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science, said Roe's book is \"an astonishingly fresh and observant new biography.</p> <p>\"It is meticulously researched ... and makes us see the poet from multiple angles, in all his fierce contradictions, so sympathetic and so modern,\" he added.</p> <p>The poet and professor Christopher Reid, author of A Scattering, agreed. \"[Roe's] radical, restless Keats is a wholly convincing and endearing portrait,\" he said.</p> <h2>Writers on drugs</h2> <p><strong>Thomas de Quincey </strong></p> <p>De Quincey started using opium to relieve the pain of toothache in 1804. His 1822 book, Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, was the first documentation of an opium addict to be published. De Quincey warned a young Samuel Taylor Coleridge against taking the drug when they met, in 1807.</p> <p><strong>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</strong></p> <p>Coleridge was a regular user of opium as a relaxant, analgesic, antidepressant, and treatment for numerous health concerns. Coleridge's addiction became public knowledge when his close friend, De Quincey, published his Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, in which Coleridge was featured. Kubla Khan is believed to depict the poet's opium-fuelled dreams.</p> <p><strong>Wilkie Collins</strong></p> <p>Collins took opium from the early 1860s in the form of laudanum to alleviate the symptoms of gout and rheumatic pain. Despite various attempts to give up the habit, including hypnosis in 1863 and a morphine injection in 1869, Collins became totally dependent on the drug in later life. Collins wrote most of The Moonstone while under the effects of opium. He told friends that, when he had finished, he hardly recognised the work as his own.</p> <p><strong>Percy Bysshe Shelley</strong></p> <p>Said to have used opium to alter his state of thinking, free his mind and calm his nerves. During his courtship of Mary Shelley, he carried a flask of laudanum with him, later apparently using it in a suicide attempt.</p> <p><strong>... but not Edgar Allan Poe</strong></p> <p>Dr Thomas Dunn English, who openly disliked Poe, insisted the poet was not a drug user. In a biography of Poe written by Arthur Quinn, a letter from English is quoted: \"Had Poe the opium habit when I knew him (before 1846) I should both as a physician and a man of observation, have discovered it during his frequent visits to my rooms, my visits at his house, and our meetings elsewhere \u2013 I saw no signs of it and believe the charge to be a baseless slander.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>Today's extract from the updated edition of <strong>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</strong>*, is by former ITN chief executive and senior executive at Ofcom, <strong>Stewart Purvis</strong>. He considers the various models for a new form of press regulation...</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396483494\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348231030197/HackBookFront.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>All the submissions to the Leveson inquiry suggesting a new form of press regulation advocated a version of \"independent\" regulation, but they differed on the degree of independence.</p> <p>Would newspapers be obliged to join? Would the state have any role at all? There were essentially three models. The first was a new system, but not truly a \"new system entirely.\"</p> <p>The national newspaper owners represented around the board table of the Press Board of Finance (PressBof) had been on something of a journey during the inquiry. One of the most influential members, perhaps the most influential, was Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Mail titles. </p> <p>He began by attacking the inquiry itself at its first event, a seminar. Leveson's team was a \"panel of experts who \u2013 while honourable distinguished people \u2013 don't have the faintest clue how mass-selling newspapers operate.\"</p> <p>Dacre wondered aloud: \"Am I alone in detecting the rank smells of hypocrisy and revenge in the political class's current moral indignation over a British press that dared to expose their greed and corruption?\"</p> <p>But half way through his speech there was a sudden change of direction. \"OK,\" he said, \"enough of being defensive. The truth is we are where we are. The perception is that the Press Complaints Commission is broken. It needs to be reformed if it is to regain trust, so may I make several suggestions.\"</p> <p>He suggested an ombudsman who could have the power to summon journalists and editors to give evidence, to name offenders and, if necessary \u2013 in the cases of the most extreme malfeasance \u2013 to impose fines. </p> <p>This was a surprising development and immediately raised the issue of how such fines could be imposed. Would it require some statutory involvement? The answer came when Lord Hunt, the new PCC chairman, told Leveson that he could achieve this through a contract agreed with newspapers rather than any statutory involvement, to which he was completely imposed.</p> <p>As the inquiry neared the end of its public hearings this contract model had been refined but was not completely resolved within the industry. According to Lord Black, representing Pressbof, he was presenting \"a snapshot of where the industry's thinking has got to at the moment\" and he was \"not going to pretend that this is the last word in it\".</p> <p>Black called it \"independently-led self regulation\", by which he meant that the system would be generated by and funded by the industry but in all component parts of the regulator there would be clear, independent majorities. </p> <p>But when Leveson and his counsel, Robert Jay QC, took Black through the detail they revealed that, for instance, industry representatives would effectively have a veto on the choice of the independent chairman and that the code committee membership would be composed of five independents and 12 editors.</p> <p>The second model - proposed in different versions by the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom, Professor Roy Greenslade and the National Union of Journalists - was a regulator based in statute, effectively a press version of Ofcom. </p> <p>The regulator would, therefore, be set up by, but not run by, the state. The idea did not command much outside support.</p> <p>The third way was a new model in UK media regulation, but one widely used in the legal profession. It was \"independent self-regulation\" but with what became known as \"statutory underpinning\" or \"statutory back-up\". </p> <p>One version was proposed by the Media Standards Trust (MST). I was one of seven past or present editors and media executives who helped draw up the proposal. The MST wanted to:</p> <p>* oblige large news organisations to join an independent self-regulatory<br>organisation; </p> <p>* ensure the system worked by establishing a backstop independent auditor recognised in statute; </p> <p>*introduce basic internal complaints mechanisms, and transparent compliance mechanisms, within large news organisations;</p> <p>* protect free speech by imposing no regulatory obligations on anyone but large news organisations.</p> <p>The proposal, therefore, had two elements that would have the force of statute \u2013 a legal requirement on large news publishers to join a self-regulatory body and the creation of a statutory oversight body. </p> <p>Other versions of \"statutory underpinning\" were put forward by the Media Regulation Roundtable and the Co-ordinating Committee for Media Reform.</p> <p>By the summer break, Lord Justice Leveson seemed, from the questions which he and Jay put to witnesses, to be unconvinced by some of the details of Pressbof's solution. </p> <p>Lord Hunt, looking for endorsement of his plan, told Leveson he was \"pleading for an opportunity to make progress now\" because of a \"number of parliamentarians who are intent on clipping the wings of the press\".</p> <p>His plea fell on deaf ears. Leveson replied: \"You say, 'If we receive a green light, we'll set up a new system.' I'm afraid I don't have coloured lights in my armoury.\"</p> <p>On the penultimate day of public hearings, the Lord Justice ventured the view, to no great surprise, that he could not see himself recommending a pure statutory regulator in the mould of Ofcom. </p> <p>Significantly, he added that he could not understand the reluctance of the press to have \"an underpinning\" based in law to ensure regulation was robust and mandatory on newspapers.</p> <h2>Ofcom's submission - 'a triumph of fence-sitting'</h2> <p>So what of Ofcom, the statutory regulator whom Lord Justice Leveson had very firmly invited to submit evidence on possible solutions? Clearly, they were to be spared any broadcasting-style role in press regulation but some other involvement could not be ruled out. </p> <p>Ofcom's submission, pointedly sub-titled \"A response to Lord Justice Leveson's request\", could equally have been called '\"We've just got out of jail once, why on earth would we want to touch any of this with a bargepole?\" </p> <p>They argued, apparently successfully, that a full statutory regulator would not be right for the press. Beyond that, their conclusions were a triumph of fence-sitting, littered with \"coulds\" rather than \"woulds\" or \"shoulds\".</p> <p>For instance, because \"there could be concerns\" about whether self-regulation would be sufficient, a minimal enabling statute \"could be necessary in some areas\".</p> <p>In their final covering letter they said that any new voluntary regime of press regulation should be reviewed within three years \"by somebody who is sufficiently independent and who is supported by an independent secretariat.\"</p> <p>And who might that be? Ofcom didn't say but one of its former executives, Tim Suter, a consultant on media regulation, had no doubt in his submission that his old employers were the right people to review or oversee the new press regulation body.</p> <p>So if Lord Justice Leveson and then the government accepts Suter's advice, the regulator that \"would cease to exist as we know it\" will have survived in an enhanced form that nobody would have predicted. </p> <p>And if it manages to avoid any responsibility for press regulation it will consider that to have been another narrow escape.</p> <p><em>On Monday:</em> In the final instalment of this series of extracts one of the book's editors, <strong>John Mair</strong>, takes a peep into the tabloid world</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis.

  "<p>G4S was, until early August of this Olympic year, hardly a household name company. Atos had been the target of disability rights campaigners but beyond the activists not many would know what they get up to. Dow Chemical would hardly register at all.</p> <p>All three of course were either official sponsors or approved suppliers of London 2012. Yet the high profile they paid so much for proved to be almost entirely negative. In <a href=\"http://www.philosophyfootball.com/view_item.php?pid=804\" title=\"\">my book</a> I made a plea for an uncommercial Games, the Olympic five rings to be protected as a symbol of sport, not a logo for the corporations. As an Olympics romantic I resented the Games' historic symbolism being used to flog fast food, fizzy drinks and dodgy internet connections.</p> <p>Yet I needn't have been so bothered, instead of militant opposition the companies managed to foul up their own PR so spectacularly that the commercialisation of London 2012 ended up being anything but the smooth and irresistible process I had feared. G4S will now forever be associated with their failure to provide the security staff and having to be bailed out by the armed services. Atos's unpopularity amongst the disabled community is now far better known than their supply of IT systems for London 2012. And the Bhopal chemical disaster, which many had probably forgotten about, was back in the news and associated with Dow Chemical.</p> <p>But it gets worse. Which marketing genius came up with the deal for Visa? Discovering that Visa is the only card with which you are able to buy tickets or food at the ground does nothing to make you feel warm about the company if you have their card, and inspires unreserved hatred for Visa if you don't own one.</p> <p>The sponsors were also a focus for unremitting scrutiny if they'd snapped up free tickets as part of any deal, especially if they were guilty of causing empty seats because they didn't take up their allocations. And hardly a day went by when the unhealthy products that most of the sponsors are responsible for were in one media spotlight or another with questions being asked why they were allowed to be associated with sport.</p> <p>London 2012 was subject to the strict guidelines for branding in all Olympic venues. These are pleasingly advert-free, an example of tough legislation to prevent the commodification of sport. It meant that outside the arenas, and in the build up, the advertising frenzy went completely overboard. But once the real action began, the standout gold medal-winning performances we'll all remember, there was not an advert or sponsor in sight. This for me is how it should be: the sponsors aren't backing the Olympics out of any charitable intent, they are using it to make money, to sell more products. They need the Olympics every bit as much as London 2012 needed their money. And there's plenty of competition to be a sponsor too, nothing reaches a global audience in the same way as the Olympics. So it was right to regulate their involvement and their profile to ensure they didn't overwhelm the Games.</p> <p>But (whisper it quietly) with no profile in the arenas, the bad press is likely to outweigh the good. What's more, the unpredictability of who wins the gold medals means they are likely to be associated with a non-Olympic sponsor. Mo Farah is a Nike man, so his gold medal was of next to no use to official London 2012 sponsor, Adidas.</p> <p>I could almost feel sorry for all the money the sponsors have wasted, but I won't. They still get all the credit for backing London 2012 rather than the Games' biggest single sponsor: you and me, the British taxpayer.</p>",
  "<p>It has been almost eleven months since Citi reached an agreement to sell EMI Music to Universal Music Group. From that moment to this, even as we worked tirelessly to help UMG reach the finish line, we have never waivered in our dedication to help our artists achieve their dreams.</p> <p>That dedication has continued to fuel our success, and there is no greater evidence of that than our August results, which I have to say were simply great. And as of this moment it looks like we are set to do even better in September and bring the half year in well above budget!</p> <p>While that is as good a reason to write you as any that I could think of, the actual reason I am doing so is that today we reached a milestone in our journey to new ownership. After many months of consideration, the European Commission has finally given its approval to the sale. (The European Commission's press release announcing their decision and their Q&amp;A is attached for you to read).</p> <p>With that approval and the imminent clearance in America, as well as those already received from other regulators around the world, UMG has cleared the final hurdle in its quest to become the owner of EMI Music.</p> <p>So, we are now ready to close this chapter in the history of EMI. It now seems all but certain that in a week's time, on September 28th, UMG will finally take control of this great and historic business.</p> <p>However as all of you know, to secure the approval of the transaction by the European Commission, UMG has committed to sell a substantial portion of our European business along with several of their own businesses. As a result, while in the coming days many of you will move on to become a part of UMG, others who are a part of the businesses that are to be sold on will have to wait a while longer to know who will be the long-term owner of their businesses.</p> <p>So what can each of you expect when the sale completes? For most everyone, certainly for some time to come, very little will change. As you have often heard me say, it will be pretty much business as usual.</p> <p>But of course the sale and the further divestiture will affect the way we are organised and over time how we work.</p> <p>The first step for those parts of the business that will be retained by Universal will be to change the reporting lines to connect each of our businesses into the UMG structure. It is UMG's aim to be sure that these lines of authority are understood by the affected executives even before they take control so all will move smoothly following completion.</p> <p>Clearly it is UMG's aim to see the two businesses move closer together.</p> <p>We will no longer be competitors, rather we will be working together to achieve a set of shared goals and objectives. To underpin that, a principle focus of the coming transition will be to unify systems and processes. Since that always takes time to accomplish, do not expect any great moves on day one.</p> <p>On the other hand, the businesses that will be sold on, as required by the agreement with the European Commission, will not be a part of the UMG structure. They will be brought together as a separate unit, managed independent of Universal. They will report to someone appropriately called the 'hold separate manager'. His role is to be sure that these businesses continue to be a strong and competitive force on the market, through and beyond the point at which they are sold. He will report to a Trustee whose duty is to assure that the intent of the agreement with the Commission is met. In the next few days Lucian [Grainge] will be announcing who will be taking up this role and I am sure that everyone affected will be as pleased as I am about his choice.</p> <p>I know this all sounds a bit complicated, but if you think about it this new unit is just a more a more concentrated version of the existing Europe+ Hub. It will draw on the resources of the central functions in the same way. And it will continue to participate in the MEA system, so repertoire will move freely under the existing intercompany terms.</p> <p>So for some time to come it will indeed be business as usual.</p> <p>However it goes without saying, that once they have a new owner they will move on and out of our system taking their repertoire with them. Though even then, it is likely there will be a further period of handover and transition.</p> <p>With the completion of the sale on the 28th, it will be the time for Ruth and me to step aside from the business.</p> <p>For those of you who are to be a part of UMG, you should look to Lucian and his team for leadership. They fought hard for the right to lead you, and I am sure that they will be a proud and committed steward of EMI and its heritage. I know that in the coming days Lucian looks forward to sharing with each of you his plans and aspirations for the future of the combined business.</p> <p>For those of you whose business remains on the journey to its ultimate ownership, I am certain that you will be well guided and led in these coming months as the search for a new home continues.</p> <p>No matter which direction our lives take us in the future, all of us will forever be a part of the EMI family.</p> <p>We have accomplished so much together, broken new ground, learned so much from each other, built lasting friendships and had a lot of fun along the way. Our dedication to our artists and our commitment to doing the right thing on their behalf has enriched us, and changed their lives \u2013 and those of millions of music fans around the world \u2013 forever. That is the legacy all of us carry with us, as we move on to the next chapter in our lives.</p> <p>I know I can speak for Ruth as well as myself that it has been both an honor and a privilege for us to have led EMI. You have made us proud.</p> <p>We wish you all the very best \u2013 you deserve it.</p> <p>Roger</p>",

How did it happen? </strong>It just blew up. It's been ridiculous. I never expected it. I finished it on Wednesday night, and woke up in the morning and it was already starting to go viral.</p> <p><strong>What was it that made you decide you wanted to do it? </strong>When <a href=\"http://www.thepoke.co.uk/2012/09/20/hell-of-a-day-at-the-poke\" title=\"\">the Poke</a> [a satirical website] came to me with the idea not long after the video was released by Nick Clegg, I thought, well I'll try to capitalise on it as soon as possible, as these things don't last too long, do they?</p> <p><strong>How long did the process of making the video take? </strong>I'm not really sure to be honest, quite a while, about six hours. It was made in three stages. The \"auto-tuning\" that everyone's talking about isn't actually auto-tuning at all, I used a program which allows you to manually alter each individual note. It's a lot different from the apps which are on the market \u2013 all those do is round off the singing to the nearest actual note. But what I've done is I've completely changed the notes. Then there was the music, I used a track I'd made before but never used, so I didn't have to create a new song to go with it. The last stage was video editing where I shot it all together.</p> <p><strong>I believe you've had other virals before \u2026 </strong>Yes, <a href=\"http://thisismyengland.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/i-dont-know-whether-to-laugh.html\" title=\"\">I have</a>, but none have gone viral as quickly as this. My first one, called Muslamic Ray Guns, about a group of EDL protesters, got about 100,000 views in the first week, and is only just beginning to get over a million now. I also remixed the Jeremy Kyle show.</p> <p><strong>What drives you to make such videos? </strong>I'm a musician by trade. At first I just didn't have any work on, so I just showed my friend the Jeremy Kyle one and the EDL one. I was working in a warehouse for a while, and I was actually working in that warehouse when my Jeremy Kyle remix got played over the tannoy. That was a bit bizarre. But for the last few months I've been full-time music producing \u2013 that's to say, in production music, music that gets used in the background of cheap productions.</p> <p><strong>What's your relationship with the Poke? </strong>They were the ones who made my Jeremy Kyle one go viral, and I've had about three or four commissions from them since. They came to me with this idea.</p> <p><strong>Things are moving really quickly now, how would you feel about charting and a potential Christmas No 1? </strong>(Laughs) I'm not sure we'll be able to keep the momentum going until Christmas, but to chart at all would be amazing. I've been in music for years, and to get inside the top 40 would be pretty cool.</p> <p><strong>I read on Twitter that Nick Clegg has requested that all the profits go to the Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust. Is that something you'd support? </strong>Yeah absolutely, I mean we did nick his speech, so he gets to choose.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel he was quite a good sport with the whole thing then? </strong>Definitely. I've even heard reports that he's been laughing about it.</p> <p><strong>Does the video attempt to send out a political message at all? </strong>No. I'm not really one of those angry students. There's no political message behind it at all. It doesn't really have a message, I've just taken what he did and set it to music. If you like it, great, if you don't, you don't.</p> <p><strong>What does the future hold then? </strong>I've got no idea yet. I'm in a band, we're working on an album, and I'd love to give it a plug. It's called Goldman, and we make synthetic, happy pop music.</p>",

Unfortunately, we couldn't fit 250 pupils and adults into a De Lorean car, so we are using our school as the time machine instead.</p> <p>I've worked on previous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2012/mar/02/hack-to-future-computer-science\">Hack To The Future events featured here in the Guardian</a>, and another at <a href=\"BBC MediaCity event http://teachcomputing.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/hack-to-the-future-bbc-media-city-5thmarch2012/\">BBC Media City on 5 March 2012</a>. Partners have included Google, Computing At School, Microsoft R&amp;D, BBC Learning as well as startups and independent experts. I ultimately hope to establish a network of these events around the country for learners of all ages to engage with.</p> <p>By live blogging the plans as they develop, I hope that fellow teachers and school will follow our activities and want to organise similar events. Plus, they'll be able to see how it was done.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday 18 September 16:15:</strong> During an ICT team meeting at school, we agree to hold a Hack To The Future event for Year 10 on Thursday 11 October. This will take place on the school's Extended Learning Day when the normal school timetable is suspended for one whole day.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday 19 September 19:44:</strong> I have created a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P_JXEYXh8Y0n8wz0NeqIpKhNvwDW7aHCs_aPeUg9SB4/edit\">Google planning document and shared it online</a> for others to view and contribute to. Now I need to start promoting the event among those likely to come and support us, using email, Twitter and Google+.</p> <p><strong>Thursday 20 September 14:40:</strong> I've been teaching all day today. I've not had a chance to give much thought to the Hack To The Future today. At the end of school, I need to drive over to Manchester for the Computing At School, Network of Excellence launch at the university, hopefully I'll find some people there that I can persuade to come to Hack To The Future.</p> <p><strong>Friday 21 September 7:30:</strong> Last night at the Computing At School event at the University of Manchester, I had an opportunity to tell people briefly what I am planning for October 11. Some of the computing science staff at the university sounded keen to get involved. I also met some of the staff involved in initial teacher training at Edge Hill, they too seem keen to get involved. I exchanged email addresses with a few and promised to send them a link to the planning document. I think that holding a Google Hangout next week on Thursday 27 September at 8pm would allow me to share my plans with a wide audience and allow others to ask questions.</p> <p><strong>Monday 24 September 08:00:</strong> Monday morning and I am starting to think that this was a real bad idea. Over the weekend I started giving more thoughts to alternatives. Nobody has signed up for any of the sessions, the timetable is blank for the day. This is starting to look like a bad idea. I hope that the Hangout I am going to be holding on Thursday helps to attract some attention, otherwise I seriously need to be considering options B and C.</p> <p><strong>Monday 24 September 15:45:</strong> After school, I have an email from Carl Simmons at <a href=\"http://www.edgehill.ac.uk/\">Edge Hill University</a> confirming that he can bring a group of teacher trainers and trainees on the day. Inventor Cefn Hoile confirms that he will be running his <a href=\"http://shrimping.it/blog/\">Shrimping</a> workshop on the day. A shrimp is Cefn's alternative to using Arduino (an open-source platform). The day ends on a positive note \u2013 it looks like we are back in business with the hack day plan.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday 25 September 11:30:</strong> Looking at the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theguardian.com/document/d/1P_JXEYXh8Y0n8wz0NeqIpKhNvwDW7aHCs_aPeUg9SB4/edit#heading=h.bf5348oj80zx\">Google planning document</a> online, I see that Carl's team from Edge Hill have now filled seven workshops into our timetable. To my delight, the timetable looks full. Although we may move some of the workshops around to create some more spaces.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday 26 September 12:30:</strong> Torsten Stauch of <a href=\"http://appshed.com/\">AppShed</a> confirms he will also be able to join us on the day. He has an idea for a workshop in which children build their own Facebook-style app complete with friends, wall and chat. They will then be able to send each other messages using their own app, using Google docs as a mini database.</p> <p><strong>Friday 28 September 12:30:</strong> Wow so much happened yesterday, I had 14 teachers in for the day on the <a href=\"http://ourlearning.co.uk/computingprogramming/teach-computing/\">Teach Computing</a> course that my school organises \u2013 some of the teachers were excited by the idea of the event that they told me that they also want to hold Hack To The Future inspired events in their schools, and some will now be joining us on 11 October. Later in the evening, I recorded a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR5GcLoPtFw\">Google Hangout</a> with more details about what to expect. Some of the Edge Hill University team joined us for their first Hangout. Looking back to Monday morning when I was sure we were going to have to call off the whole event, it is funny how much can change in a few days. I am speaking at Blackpool BarCamp on Saturday and PyConUK on Sunday, hopefully I can recruit some more geeks for our <a href=\"http://teachcomputing.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/hack-to-the-future-bbc-media-city-5thmarch2012/\">Meet The Geek workshop</a> on 11 October. </p> <h2><strong>How to run a 3D Printing Workshop</strong></h2> <p><strong>Friday 5 October:</strong> As part of the organisation for HackToTheFuture on 11 October, I found myself discussing ways of planning workshops with workshop leaders. One interesting problem was presented by Duncan Hull at University of Manchester. Duncan wanted to lead a workshop on 3D printing, but wondered how best to engage 30 children with just one 3D printer in the room. Duncan is going to bring a 3D printer along to the hack day to demonstrate, but it can take at least 15 minutes to print a small item. Duncan is not a secondary school teacher and he wondered what would be the best way to present the concept of 3D printing to a class of 30 pupils.</p> <p>Here is a very rough sketch of a lesson plan that we developed together for a one-hour workshop on the topic of 3D printing.<br>Connect/explore</p> <p>After a very brief \"Hello, I'm XXX\" explain that the workshop is centred around 3D printing. You have a 3D printer in the room with you (hidden under a towel/bed sheet). You don't want to reveal it just yet, since you want to find out what they know already. You want the pupils to work together in groups of three to five and try to answer as many of the following questions as possible (without using the internet). Suggest that in some ways the printer is similar to a 2D printer (for example laser/inkjet) but it differs in many other aspects.</p> <p>\u2022 Sketch and label what a 3D printer might look like.<br>\u2022 If a 2D printer uses paper, what medium would a 3D printer use?<br>\u2022 What types of products could/could not be manufactured using a 3D printer?<br>\u2022 How much might one cost?<br>\u2022 Where can you buy them from?<br>\u2022 Can you make one yourself?<br>\u2022 Is it possible to print a 3D printer?<br>\u2022 What would the really useful things be?<br>\u2022 What could the harmful effects of 3D printing be?<br>\u2022 Will everyone soon have one in their home?</p> <p>After a few minutes for pupils to discuss their answers, ask them to present and share their answers to the rest of the class. The workshop leader should confirm, deny, and praise answers as appropriate.</p> <p><strong>Reveal/demonstrate</strong></p> <p>At this point, reveal what the 3D printer looks like. Explain some of the practicalities and limitations as well as the possibilities. Then demonstrate manufacture of an item using the 3D printer that has been brought along. It is worth having some YouTube videos to hand in case the printer decides to stop working. I would suggest one video clip that demonstrates the wow factor of 3D printing - such as this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" jlq5r84tlvw&amp;nr\"\">wrench video</a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aghzpO_UZE\">print a flute</a>) in around one to give minutes and another that demonstrates the printing process (perhaps speeded up to reduce the boredom). Then, while the 3D printer starts printing, introduce the next activity.</p> <p><strong>Respond</strong></p> <p>Present the groups that the children were in before with some interesting challenges or problems to solve. These could be printed on cards for them to read and discuss. You could have separate problems for each small group (some duplication among groups). Instruct them that they have 15 to 20 minutes to work together in a group to solve the problem/challenge. The challenges could be related to the new moral/ethical challenges that 3D printing provides - such as <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/home-3d-printing-is-killing-the-manufacturing-industry/\">counterfeiting and fraud</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.discovery.com/news_tech_nfpc/2012/08/3d-printer-fetus-fasotec-120808.html\">printing an unborn baby</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12520951\">printing body parts</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19813382\">printing a 3D gun</a>, intellectual property, ownership. Each group should prepare some thoughts or slides to share with the rest of the class to demonstrate how they could solve the problem they were presented with.</p> <p><strong>Gather/share</strong></p> <p>Allow around 10 minutes at the end to first show the 3D printed object (if successful), then to allow for a show and tell. So, each group would lead with \"We were asked to consider how...\" and \"We thought the answer might be to.\"</p> <p>Are you thinking of running a hack day at your school? Need some advice?

  "<p>The covert cyberwar being waged in the Middle East and north Africa \u2013 particularly against Iran and its allies \u2013 is even more sophisticated and widespread than had previously been understood, according to new research.</p> <p>Two leading computer security laboratories \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.kaspersky.com/\" title=\"\">Kaspersky Lab</a> and <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com\" title=\"\">Symantec</a> \u2013 have been studying a series of powerful cyberweapons used against targets including the Iranian nuclear programme and <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/08/gauss-espionage-tool/\" title=\"\">Lebanese banks</a> accused of laundering money for Iran and its ally Hezbollah. They are <a href=\"http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/750/Full_Analysis_of_Flames_Command_Control_servers\" title=\"\">now convinced that all were probably created by a national government or governments working together</a>.</p> <p>They have also identified key similarities in the weapons' computer coding suggesting some \u2013 if not all \u2013 were worked on at different times by the same or related groups of programmers.</p> <p>Suspicion over the most likely culprit has centred on the US and Israel \u2013 not least after <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-israel-developed-computer-virus-to-slow-iranian-nuclear-efforts-officials-say/2012/06/19/gJQA6xBPoV_story.html\" title=\"\">anonymous briefings to the Washington Post</a> by an unnamed former senior US intelligence official this year.</p> <p>In June the New York Times disclosed that one of the weapons identified in the last two years \u2013 Stuxnet, a sabotage program used to attack Iran's nuclear centrifuge in 2010 \u2013 was part of a joint US-Israel cyberwar plan, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2\" title=\"\">codenamed Olympic Games</a>, targeting the Islamic republic, which suggests that the other cyber weapons could be part of the same wide operation.</p> <p>The latest disclosures follow forensic analysis by Symantec and the Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab of two command and control servers used by a sophisticated espionage worm named Flame, which was discovered by Iran this year stealing data from its computers.</p> <p>Analysts believe from studying fragments of Flame that it was only one of four similar weapons being used simultaneously, the other three of which have not been identified.</p> <p>Equally intriguing was the discovery that Flame and Stuxnet are related, with an early version of Stuxnet appearing in Flame as a plug-in.</p> <p>\"The Flame malware, including all of its components, was very large and our ongoing investigation revealed more and more details since that time,\" <a href=\"http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/750/Full_Analysis_of_Flames_Command_Control_servers\" title=\"\">Kaspersky Lab and Symantec said in a statement this week</a>, after being commissioned by the International Telecommunication Union to study the new cyberweapon. \"Flame was so advanced that only the world's top cryptographers could be able to implement it.\"</p> <p>They added: \"In June we definitively confirmed that Flame developers communicated with the Stuxnet development team, which was another convincing fact that Flame was developed with nation-state backing.\"</p> <p>According to the researchers Flame itself was a huge operation.</p> <p>Kaspersky Lab's Alexander Gostev said estimating the scale was problematic but researchers had been able to discover data intended to be kept by one of several command-and-control servers. \"Based on this we can see that more than five gigabytes of data was uploaded to this particular server a week, from more than 5,000 infected machines. This is certainly an example of cyber-espionage conducted on a massive scale.\"</p> <p>According to the researchers' analysis: \"During a period of just one week (25 March-2 April) 5,377 unique IPs were seen connecting to the server, the vast majority in Iran: 3,702. What is also surprising is the large number of IPs from Sudan: 1,280.</p> <p>\"Our previous statistics did not show a large number of infections in Sudan, so this must have been a dedicated campaign targeting systems in Iran and Sudan.</p> <p>\"If just one server handled 5,000-plus victims during a one-week period and given several servers were available, we can estimate the total number of victims for Flame is probably higher than previously estimated, exceeding 10,000.\"</p> <p>Flame is the latest to be identified in a series of related cyberweapons targeting Iran since June 2010, when the existence of Stuxnet was disclosed \u2013 including Duqu, an espionage program first detected last year, and Flame and Gauss this summer.</p> <p>Vitaly Kamluk, chief malware expert at Kaspersky Lab, said that it had considered three possible sources of such programs.</p> <p>\"It is not the sort of cyberweapon you see developed by criminals looking to access bank accounts nor is it the sort of weapon used by activists to make a political point. Those often use very available tools to write the programs.\"</p> <p>Last week's report said the data stolen by Flame was encrypted \"in such a way that only the attackers can read it through strong public key cryptography. These features are not normally found in malware created by everyday cybercriminals, reaffirming our initial conclusions that Flame is a nation-state sponsored attack.\"</p> <p>Kamluk added: \"Flame was massive and complex and we have identified the nicknames of at least four individuals involved in developing it.\"</p> <p>He said considerable effort had been put into disguising the program, not least in how it had been designed to attack a small and specific set of targets rather than spread rapidly across the internet.</p> <p>\"The discovery of Stuxnet, Duqu, Gauss and Flame is changing our entire view of cyberwarfare.\"</p> <p>Nor does it seem likely that \u2013 even with the new discoveries \u2013 the cyberwar plan has been slowed. There is evidence that some aspects of the latest cyberweapons have yet to be launched, recalling the claim to the Washington Post this summer by its anonymous former intelligence source.</p> <p>\"This is about preparing the battlefield for another type of covert action,\" the source said then. \"Cyber-collection against the Iranian programme is way further down the road than this.\"</p>",
  "<p>Universal Music has been given the green light for its \u00a31.2bn EMI takeover by the European Commission, but will have to sell off labels that bring in nearly a third of the British company's revenues \u2013 including recordings from Coldplay, Pink Floyd and David Bowie \u2013 in order to gain approval.</p> <p>The deal has already been cleared in Australia and Japan and was also approved in the US on Friday.</p> <p>Valuable EMI assets Universal will have to offload include the historic Parlophone record label \u2013 bar the Beatles \u2013 but also the British company's half share in the perennially popular Now! That's What I Call Music compilation series and its operations in 10 other European countries.</p> <p>Universal said that despite the large-scale enforced sell-off \u2013 understood to account for 10% of the new combined business's global revenues and 30% of the existing EMI operation \u2013 the deal will still be financially positive and parent Vivendi is still supportive of the music group's management.</p> <p>But the approval process has been bruising for Universal, which has been forced to make far more divestments than originally expected and has required the Vivendi chairman, Jean Rene Fortou, to join the lobbying effort in Brussels alongside the Universal Music chief executive, Lucian Grainge.</p> <p>\"We are delighted Universal Music will retain over two-thirds of EMI on a global basis, contributing to the accretive nature of the deal,\" said a Universal spokesman. \"With a broad array of EMI artists from Katy Perry, Emeli Sand\u00e9 [and] Robbie Williams ... to icons like The Beatles, the Beach Boys, Genesis and Bob Seger, we remain true to our vision: to invest in talent and grow the company to offer consumers more music and more choice.\"</p> <p>According to music industry sources as many as a dozen parties have already expressed interest in snapping up assets, including Warner Music and BMG Rights Management, the failed bidders for EMI's recording and publishing businesses. Universal will have to sell the labels to companies active in the music industry, or have a \"proven track record\" \u2013 and cannot re-sign any of the artists for a period of 10 years.</p> <p>In the US, the FTC approved the acquisition with a unanimous 5-0 vote, with no remedies or disposals required. The deal has been approved by regulators by all relevant country regulators.</p> <p>Vivendi said that the deal would be able to \"significantly strengthen its ownership of exclusive content\".</p> <p>In an email to staff the outgoing EMI chief executive, Roger Faxon, said: \"With [EC] approval and the imminent clearance in America, as well as those already received from other regulators around the world, UMG has cleared the final hurdle in its quest to become the owner of EMI Music.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Sir Richard Branson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/19/branson-universal-music-virgin-records?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">attempt to buy back Virgin Records UK</a> appears to have been thwarted, as Universal Music will not have to divest the business \u2013 although it is selling Virgin Classics.</p> <p>\"Competition in the music business is crucial to preserve choice, cultural diversity and innovation,\" said the European Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. \"The very significant commitments proposed by Universal will ensure that competition in the music industry is preserved and that European consumers continue to enjoy all its benefits.\"</p> <p>A major concern for the European Commission was the ability for an enlarged Universal Music to dominate the price of digital music, especially licensing deals with players such as Amazon, Apple, Spotify and Vodafone.</p> <p>\"The commission's investigation confirmed that even a customer such as Apple continues to launch new digital music services and that it is not established that it could defeat price increase or other types of worsening of licensing terms by Universal,\" said the commission.</p> <p>Bruce Kilpatrick, head of City competition at law firm Addleshaw Goddard, said that Universal had paid a \"high regulatory price\" but added that the impact of Apple on the music market also helped the deal go through.</p> <p>\"With such an extensive remedies package, Universal has paid a high regulatory price for EMI. But it's important to put this into context: this deal would have been blocked 10 years ago, before iTunes was established, so Universal will still be pleased to have secured clearance and will be confident that it can make the deal work for the benefit of its shareholders.\"</p> <p>As part of the deal Universal has agreed to drop the clause known as \"most favoured nation\" \u2013 which obliges digital customers such as Apple to extend any favourable term granted to rivals also to Universal \u2013 for 10 years.</p> <p>\"This commitment will allow Universal's competitors to negotiate more freely with digital customers and further levels the playing field between these competitors and Universal,\" said the commission. \"The commission concluded that competition on the digital music markets in the European Economic Area will be adequately preserved and that the transaction will have no negative impact on consumers.\"</p> <p>It has come in for intense criticism from the independent music industry, which is concerned about Universal's global dominance, but there has been a positive response to Universal having to sell off valuable EMI's assets to push the deal through.</p> <p>\"Universal are being forced to sell the crown jewels of EMI following their misjudged attempt to persuade the European Commission that there would be no competition concerns,\" said Alison Wenham, chief executive of the Association of Independent Music. \"We congratulate the EC on a very diligent and thorough investigation.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://musicandcopyright.wordpress.com/\">According to the Music &amp; Copyright Blog</a>, Universal has an almost 36% share of total recorded music revenues globally, ahead of Sony Music on almost 22% and Warner Music on 15%.</p> <p>Impala, which represents music companies including Beggars Group, home to Adele, said the remedies were \"not tough enough\" and that Universal's \"arrogance\" had paid off.</p> <p>\"Universal's arrogance has paid off for them ... they have destroyed a significant competitor, and that even with these divestments their ability to dominate and control the market has reached even more unacceptable levels,\" said Martin Mills, chairman of Beggars. \"Anyone trying to start a new digital service will be realising that very soon, and we will continue to look to the regulators to monitor ongoing behaviour.\"</p> <p>EMI's Faxon said it will be \"pretty much business as usual\" for business units of EMI that Universal is retaining.</p> <p>However, the parts that are to be sold off, probably over a period of about six months, will be ringfenced as a separate unit managed independent of Universal.</p> <p>Faxon, who said he will step aside on 28 September when the deal is complete, said that an executive will be appointed in a few days to run the businesses as a \"hold separate manager\".</p> <p>\"His role is to be sure that these businesses continue to be a strong and competitive force on the market, through and beyond the point at which they are sold,\" said Faxon. \"He will report to a trustee whose duty is to assure that the intent of the agreement with the commission is met\".</p> <p>Faxon is already the subject of rumours of a shift to a rival, with Warner Music touted as his most likely future employer.</p> <h2>Full list of divestments</h2> <p>\u2022 EMI Recording Limited (including EMI's iconic Parlophone label, with the exception of the Beatles), featuring artists such as Coldplay, Blur, Kylie Minogue and artists with steady revenues such as Pink Floyd, Cliff Richard and Tina Turner.</p> <p>\u2022 Other EMI labels, such as Chrysalis (featuring Spandau Ballet, but without the Robbie Williams catalogue) and Mute Records (featuring Depeche Mode, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds).</p> <p>\u2022 EMI Classics/Virgin Classics artist and composers and EMI's half share in the popular \"Now!

  "<h2><strong>Ferdinand von Schirach </strong><em>The Collini Case</em></h2> <p>A venerable man of German industry is brutally murdered in a hotel room. The killer hands himself in to police but refuses to explain his crime. To the press and the courts it looks like the motiveless work of a psychopath \u2013 until an inexperienced defence lawyer Caspar Leinen discovers documents about the dead man's secret past in Nazi-occupied Italy.</p> <p>Lawyer Ferdinand von Schirach \u2013 a lawyer whose grandfather Baldur von Schirach led the Hitler Youth was reich youth leader of the Nazi party \u2013 established himself as an author with two collections of short stories in 2009 and 2010, Guilt and Crime. The Collini Case has not only been a bestseller since it was published in 2011, it has also ignited a debate about a 1968 law, the introductory act to administrative offences, that meant many accused of war crimes during the Nazi era could only be tried for manslaughter, not murder. In February this year, the justice ministry commissioned an investigation into criminal law changes of the 1950s and 1960s.</p> <p>Germany's new role at the centre of Europe's political stage has led to soul searching at home and abroad: is the new generation done with atoning for the sins of its grandparents, finished with wartime guilt? Judging by the success of Von Schirach's novel, the process of historical self-examination is far from finished. In many ways The Collini Case is a step back from the last bestseller by a lawyer-novelist, Bernhard Schlink's The Reader, published in 1995, which broke many taboos by portraying a Nazi criminal in a partly sympathetic light. Von Schirach's book stays resolutely on the victims' side.</p> <h2><strong>Manfred Spitzer </strong><em>Digital Dementia</em></h2> <p>The famous neuroscientist argues that our growing reliance on search engines, satnavs and Wikipedia means we are failing to give our grey matter the kind of workout it needs. The unlikely heroes of Spitzer's study turn out to be a familiar species: London black-cab drivers. Thanks to a study of a taxi driver who had memorised \"the knowledge\" of the capital's streets, he writes, \"we know that the brain is not only the most complicated, but the most dynamic organ in our body. It grows or shrinks according to usage.\"</p> <h2><strong>Wolfgang Herrndorf </strong><em>Tschick</em></h2> <p>Praised by critics as a \"German Huckleberry Finn\", Herrndorf's Spiegel bestseller tells the story of a teenager from a wealthy but dysfunctional family and his Russian-German classmate, who one summer holiday embark on a road trip around the former GDR in a stolen Lada. It's also an exploration of the real East Germany as the west still doesn't know it.</p> <p>\"The world is bad, and people are bad too. That's what my parents told me, my teachers told me and television tells me. But the strange thing was that on our journey Tschick and I almost exclusively met those few people who weren't bad at all.\" A few months before the novel appeared in 2010, 46-year-old Herrndorf was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer. He has been chronicling his daily struggles with the illness in an <a href=\"http://www.wolfgang-herrndorf.de/\" title=\"\">online journal</a>since.</p> <h2><strong>Ann-Marlene Henning and Tina Bremer-Olszewski </strong><em>Make Love</em></h2> <p>A Joy of Sex for a generation growing up with internet porn, combining infographics, arthouse photography and practical advice. \"The abundance of sex creates a false impression of familiarity: we've seen it all, we've done it all,\" the authors write in the introduction. \"But the problem is: what the media presents as sexuality has little to do with the real thing.\" As a remedy, Henning and Bremer-Olszewski give us surprising facts (did you know that a full-on snog engages as many as 17 muscles?), a guide to rude words from around the world and a thorough deconstruction of modern porn cliches. Shifted more than 60,000 copies in the first 10 weeks after publication.</p> <h2>Rolf Dobelli: The Art of Clear Thinking</h2> <p>In 52 short chapters Dobelli tries to put a finger on why CEOs, economists or just the average shopper makes mistakes: because we sometimes believe in stories rather than facts, because we fail to draw lessons from our own failures or because we think that an item chosen from a large selection is more valuable than one from a small one. Mixing management-speak and real science, Dobelli's bestseller (300,000 sales to date) follows in the wake of Naseem Nicholas Taleb's Black Swan and Daniel Kahnemann's Thinking Fast and Slow.</p> <h2><strong>Thilo Sarrazin </strong><em>Europe Doesn't Need the Euro</em></h2> <p>\"If the euro fails, then Europe failed,\" Angela Merkel said in September last year, but former Bundesbank member Thilo Sarrazin doesn't buy it. Ditching the deutschmark, he says, was driven by \"magical thinking\", and those Germans now calling for eurobonds are \"driven by that very German reflex, which says that we have only repented for the Holocaust and world war once all our belongings, including our money, has been handed into European ownership\".</p> <p>Europe Doesn't Need the Euro has sold more than 200,000 copies, but critics have taken issues with some of Sarrazin's conclusions. The S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper asked why Sarrazin doesn't spell out what would have happened if Germany had stuck with the deutschmark. \"Perhaps because a strong D-mark would have made German wares increasingly expensive?\" As with his polemical 2010 book on Germany's migrant minorities, Germany Abolishes Itself, Sarrazin is quick to point the finger at potential problems but much slower to come up with constructive solutions.</p>",

The Department of Health has joined forces with the Alzheimer's Society to launch <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/09/dementia-campaign/\" title=\"\">a new campaign</a> to encourage people to talk to family members showing signs of dementia. On the Not so Big Society blog, social worker and commentator Ermintrude says <a href=\"http://notsobigsociety.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/world-alzheimers-day-2012/\" title=\"\">\"there can be a drive in policy to both marginalise those who have dementias and to increase the pressures on their families\"</a>. She adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dementia still carries a stigma. I know the government refers to a 'dementia challenge' \u2013 subtitled 'Fighting back against dementia' but generally I like to think of it as an opportunity to think about the way that society responds in different way. What are we fighting? Shouldn't we be working with and walking alongside dementia? We talk about an 'ageing population' and a 'tsunami of people with dementia' with an inherent negativity. While most dementias are not reversible, it's importance that the tenets of 'recovery' are not lost in terms of losing hope around a person and promoting a more positive quality of life and environment for those with dementia and for their families where they have them.<br>By referring to a 'dementia challenge' and framing dementia as 'one of the greatest challenges we face' I worry that we remove the responsibility of society to promote a less stigmatising environment around people with dementia. It's that social model of mental health again. Often dementias are forgotten by traditional mental health organisations because there are some differences but I'd like to see a lot of the developments in terms of user voice in mental health extended to dementia services and particularly towards users as well as carers as there is a propensity, particularly in older adults services to assume that the user and carer voice will be one and the same and can be interchangeable. I've been working in services long enough to know the importance of capturing user voice separately from carer voice and think that 'lazy' engagement is much easier than engagement which seeks out those who may have more difficulty communicating. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Dementia UK is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DementiaUK/status/249085399975198720\" title=\"\">inviting Twitter users</a> to \"share ideas about how we can combat stigma and make communities more dementia friendly\", to which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhoseShoes/status/249086976861540352\" title=\"\">Gill Phillips responds</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How to raise dementia awareness? @DementiaUK THROUGH STORIES!

He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... it is at 16-18 years old or even younger for some, that we fall into the myriad of traps that life can spring upon us. Add to that loss of family support and you're in real trouble. Vulnerable young people are just that, vulnerable. They are prey to people who want to exploit them for financial gain, either through prostitution, drug addiction, and drug dealing to feed a habit or through exploitation in an unregistered work place. Surely this is not how we would want to treat our children? But unfortunately we do. So in these cases homelessness is a byproduct or structural issue caused by the loss of guidance and support and, let's not beat around the bush, love. And who is the worst parent? I would say the state. There are more homeless people that have been through the cares system in one form or another than in any other category. The same can be said for our prison population.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Barrett adds that welfare reforms and other budget cuts are making the job of Porchlight and other charities increasingly difficult:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My nightmare is what we do when it comes to making decisions between those we can help and those who we cannot. The spectre of the debate between the deserving and undeserving poor raises its head once again. The problem here of course is that I cannot choose. We have to try and help those who are willing to accept our help, that's why as a charity we spend as little as possible on administration whilst attempting to support our frontline services to deliver the charity's mission.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 A new briefing paper for the candidates in the upcoming <strong>police and crime commissioner</strong> elections.

  "<h2>Changes to GCSE exams</h2> <p>Teachers and pupils were keen to share their experiences and thoughts on education secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/17/nick-clegg-gcse-replacement-confidence?commentpage=1#end-of-comments\">Michael Gove's proposed changes to GCSE exams in this thread.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18311907\"><strong>cymraeg147</strong> said:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gove and Clegg have come up with this plan to change GCSE exams to O'levels without any consultation with teachers, pupils, parents, universities or the examining boards. It is just a hobby horse for this self absorbed but incompetent duo. Continuous assessment is out and one exam at the end of a two year course will be the only method of evaluating a students potential. How reckless is that.<br>In so doing they have trashed the existing GCSE qualification in the eyes of industry and the universities, a qualification that many young people have worked hard to achieve.<br>In my experience at uni continuous assessment, as GCSE's currently are, is far more rigorous than a two year course that you can pass or fail on the basis of one exam. When coursework has no relevance to outcomes it may or may not be completed. Individuals can do little work and just cram for a couple of weeks at the end of the course just to get through the exam. Gove and Clegg are reducing the GCSE examination to a memory test devoid of understanding.<br>You couldn't make it up.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18311792\"><strong>misterbee</strong> said:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I took CSE's in the late 60's and they were a complete waste of time.They were the level we were educated to with no encouragement or attempt to raise the our sights any higher.Many people who took them achieved Grade 1 in subjects,which was supposed to be the equivelant to a GCE Grade C,but neither employers nor further ed considered them equal.The fact that Gove tried to bring them back just highlights how divisive this government is.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314784       \"><strong>dobedo</strong> added: </a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As an employer:<br>I do not give GCSE results much consideration at all; previous experience, employment, references and the personal achievements, passtimes, hobbies and activities from outside school carry more weight in assessing employability, as is the appearance and personaility of the prospective employee.<br>For those at 16 and looking for a job, GCSE's lost their credibility a long time ago. Grade inflation has practically made everything below an A a fail.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"     http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314525\"><strong>Thickstp</strong> </a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As someone who benefitted from the old system because I sussed the exam technique early, I was still appalled to see good, bright students get much lower results because their exam technique was weaker.<br>I was doing GCEs at the time when the first experiments with continuous assessment were being tried. In our case with the English Language 'O' Level. This would have been 1972-73. It still included exam elements but the continuous assessment elements were rigorous and I felt it was a much fairer and more balanced system.<br>Some students came into the school to do 'A' Levels as their \"Secondary Modern\" school (a euphemism for a dumping ground in my view), only did CSEs and had no 6th Form. They were in many cases brighter than many who had passed the 11 plus but they again suffered from the exam system when they took A Levels as they had not honed the technique at GCE level.<br>Switching to an exam only system will allow the relatively lazy student like I was at the time, to do better, based on exam technique not substance. I suspect it will also accentuate the advantage for the heavily coached private school candidates. Which is presumably why Gove likes the idea.<br>These so called \"reforms\" are a retrograde step back towards a profoundly flawed system.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18315387\"><strong>ThatWouldbeTelling</strong>:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My own experiences as a school pupil and then as a parent and school governor has given me a concern that school standards have been sacrified over the years in favour of grades and teachers' reputations. This may be unfair but for example:<br>My daughter spent the majority of her year 2 in primary school being taught to the test for her SATs of that year. In effect, that meant that the year was spent mainly on two subjects: Literacy and Numeracy. The school kept putting back the teaching of other subjects until the SATs practice and exams were over. This meant that she only started History lessons in the second half of the summer term. Long before the end of the year the light went out in her eyes to the effect that her mother and I agreed that year 2 was a wasted year for her.<br>I was working on a project covering Germany a couple of years back which requried cold calling German businesses. When a colleague in her mid-20s told me that she had an A @ A' Level in German I asked if she could help with my calls. She said she could barely remember a word of German because her teacher had basically told how to pass her exam but hadn't actually taught her any meaningful aptitude in the language.<br>Two teachers, one my daughter's form teacher in year six in primary school and the other a head teacher speaking to me in my capacity as a school governer, told me directly that these days you have to teach to the test otherwise you can't successfully operate as a teacher or as a school.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314433       \"><strong>mintycakeyfroggy</strong></a> <br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I took GSCE's, I am in no doubt reform needs to take place, GSCE's aren't perfect, largely due to curriculum and differing exam boards. However, if I had not done GSCE's I would have a completely different life. I was suffering in my final year of school from PTSD which included several panic attacks a day. I got extra time in the exam e.t.c. But no one could prevent the anxiety I felt, this undoubtedly affected my memory and my ability within exams. Up until my final 6 months at school I was an A/A* student, my final year exams reduced these grades to B's and C's, as my exam scores were C's or lower. I was not trying any less I was simply ill and unable to perform to my best. Had I had one exam at the end of the year I would have been marked with under C grades, not allowing me to go onto do A-levels, university and post graduate courses. With a final exam there is no look at overall achievemnt. It is a snapshot of what the person on that day is able to produce, a memory test</p> </blockquote> <h2>Topless Kate</h2> <p>Much interesting (and some less intelligent) debate ensued following the news pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge without her bikini top on would be published in a French magazine - including a debate around privacy laws when it comes to the paparazzi and the culture of the tabloid presses - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/sep/17/topless-kate-pictures-uk-papers\">here are some of the snippets from the women's blog.</a></p> <p><strong>PatriciaInOttawa</strong>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now that an Italian magazine is printing The Photos, I warrant it won't be long until they are in the English tabloids. Their evil little cash registers where their hearts should be will calculate that any fine or lawsuit will be worth the millions of copies they will sell. And they will sell, because you buy the trash in vast quantities.<br>Why oh why do you have this culture of wanting to destroy anything and everything after you build it up first?<br>I am quite convinced that the UK press won't be satisfied until Kate tops herself or is checked into a looney bin. This will be accompanied by endless dirges about the lovely princess who couldn't find happiness. Bleeuuurgggggh. Leave them the fuck alone.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314294   \"><strong>grayfox</strong>:</a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The comparison with page-3 girls is problematic given that these individuals consent to be photographed and are paid following the distribution of the images.<br>But the whole MailOnline sidebar is based around paparazzi shots which makes the faux-outrage at these pictures a little hard to stomach. Didn't the Mail solemnly promise to never use paparazzi shots after Diana? I wonder what happened to that sentiment.<br>In any case I have little sympathy. If you create a personality cult around certain individuals and proclaim them to be special via hysterical coverage, but neglect to establish an absolute dictatorship, this kind of thing is inevitable.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314267\"><strong>ToffeeGuy</strong>:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Much as I am no fan of Page 3 or The Sun I don't think the comparison is a fair one.<br>The models on Page 3 want and are paid to be in the paper. Numerous celebrity 'babes' are also complicit in wanting to appear in the papers by attending film premieres in whatever outfit they think will get them noticed. Often there is collusion between media, celebrities and publicists to get their picture in the papers.<br>Ok, getting photographed on a beach is slightly different but celebrities know they are likely to get spotted.<br>The difference here is that Kate was in a private villa. I think there is a hint of naivety in being outdoors anywhere topless within lens distance. A harsh lesson learnt perhaps.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314092\"><strong>shinything</strong> </a>said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think this is spot on. I could not see the fuss from the beginning. The Dutches was caught topless by the paparazzi, big deal. If it were any other celebrity no one would care, but the British media is still in the illusion that the royals need special treatment. It is fine as you say to have endless parade of topless somen, as long as they are from the lower classes. Kate and William better be prepared, they are treated like the celebrities that they are which means they are top news and anyone who can make money out of them will try. If they wanted to be treated differently they should not holiday in places where they can be caught of guard and as someone said what about the servants, did they not mind seen like that in front of their staff. Clearly not, are we still in the days where kings and queens and dukes and can get away with murder? Clearly we are</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18316082\"><strong>amateurdramatic</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As many of the above have said, Page 3 and \"Boobgate\" (or should that be \"Boobdrawbridge\") are not comparable; however, the criticism of the nip slip / upskirt / long lens culture is spot on. But I think the article is too reductionist and is missing the point. In my opinion, it's not the fetishisation of woman's bodies which is the issue. Remember, the culture is partly driven by photographs in the female glossies of both men and women, sexual and non-sexual images. The issue is one of privacy. Surely it's not difficult to work out if someone would want a photograph printed or not, and surely it's just as easy (if you're unsure) to phone their agent?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18315738\"><strong>ManchePaul</strong> </a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Good grief, the British are so bloody confused, both prurient and puritan at the same time. We are probably the only western European country that is terrified of nudity and freaks out at the possibility of anyone seeing anyone else naked. Certainly France and Germany don't even notice it. Yet at the same time there is this voyeuristic obsession of seeing pictures of half naked women in general, and sneaky long lens shots in particular. The Sun and the Mail seem to have readers who are essentially the looking up women's skirts perverts that appear in court, unless they are taking the pictures for those papers.<br>This woman was not wearing a top on a beach. Pretty normal behaviour on beaches in every other European country. The privacy issue is the one that counts, and it does not matter if she was completely naked or trying on a winter coat: taking long lens pictures is an ugly and wrong business.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18315355\"><strong>Secretary1001</strong></a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Surely the issue is not the body parts that have been photographed but how the photographs have been obtained and whether it's ok to force somebody to share private aspects of their life with the public at large. If you're on private property, a mile from the nearest road and not on a public engagement, surely you have a reasonable right to expect that what you do and how you dress while doing it is something you can keep private. I would have thought that by deliberately choosing such a secluded venue for topless sunbathing it was clear to anybody but a bottom-feeding pap that you didn't want to share any aspect of that sunbathing with anybody but the people with you at the time. It wouldn't matter if they'd only published photos of her picking her nose and eating it, the fact that she didn't want to share her holiday or seek to publicise her holiday and took more than reasonable steps to ensure privacy while on holiday means the photos, let alone the decision to publish them for nothing more that profit and circulation numbers, are indefensible. It's got nothing to do with hypocrisy about tits.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Painkillers</h2> <p>Does taking aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen actually increase your likelihood to get a headache? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/19/headaches-painkillers\">Following new research from NICE</a>, our readers shared their experiences and debated and pros and cons of killing pain.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18360039\"><strong>mrsmungo</strong></a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As someone who went to the doctor, after driving back from France where on the road home my vision suddenly split into two very distinctive views !! i went to the doctor where seeing my regular G.P. told me it was a megraine and to take the tablets. The next day my vision split into two very distinctive views again and on returning to the doctors saw a very young locum who immediately asked my wife to drive me thirty miles to the nearest hospital with a C.T. scanner. We arrived at ten o'clock in the morning and after being seen by the junior rergistrar placed on a trolley in a closed down ward to wait my turn at the end of the days scanning list at 6 in the evening. I slept most of the day and when my turn came for the scan i was wheeled into place in the donut shaped C.T. scanner.<br>You know when somethings up when the single technician behind the glass, their face ghastly green from the imaging screen suddenly becomes a multi headed hydra with a plethera of pointing fingers. Within half an hour i was whisked back the other way, thirty miles the other way of my original starting place and starting on a course the changed my life totally. What was on the screen ? A vague image of what was later diagnosed as a super giant cerebral aneursym. NEVER NEVER NEVER under estimate headaches. EVER</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18359443\"><strong>FlamingJune</strong></a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it entirely depends on what is causing the headache or migraine in the first place. I suffered from chronic headaches and migraines for a year and a half (and they are different - migraines can have very varied symptoms for different people, but often people who've never had one can be very scathing). My GP was at a bit of a loss, and kept wanting to prescribe me Migraleve and a mild anti-depressant. I was very against the idea of just medicating the pain without getting to the root of th problem, and certainly didn't want to take an anti-depressant every day. So in my case, this NICE study instinctively rings true and makes sense. I eventually put two and two together and realised there was a lot of tension in my neck and shoulders and a lot of physiotherapy has worked wonders. Unfortunately, as other posters have commented, some people's migraines are triggered by things that are hard to avoid.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18356843\"><strong>misterbee</strong></a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Don't know if it's just coincidence,but I used to get a lot of headaches and took painkillers regularly.For some reason (can't remember why now) I stopped taking them and I rarely get headaches now.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18356127\"><strong>Pfutsch</strong></a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be brutally honest, in a nation which is hopelessly incompetent at dosing its alcohol and junk food intake, it should not surprise us at all that people are over-consuming even simple drugs like aspirin and Ibuprofen. I know several people personally who got into various cycles of 'light' drug use - even things like combining red bull and pro-plus which then develops into a daily habit.<br>A good doctor (and I was lucky enough to find one as a chronic headache sufferer) will enlighten his patient about the causes, steer him/her away from the painkiller approach (which only deals with the symptoms), and recommend massage, exercise, yoga or a change of diet. Stopping smoking and drinking heps enormously (and drinking in combination with Aspirin, Paracetamol or Ibuprofen is really bad for your internal organs in any case).</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18354026   \"><strong>RayNoble</strong></a> <br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I must say I have not been overly impressed by the way this has been handled by NICE in the media. This may not be their fault of course. The key term here is \"could be causing\". Which means that for many it is not 'causing' a problem. It has been estimated that up to 1 in 50 people experience headaches caused by medication overuse and that women are five times more likely to get them than men. NICE haven't really given the background research for this so it is difficult to make sense of it. Of course I don't doubt it. Had someone asked me before this NICE statement I would have suspected that overuse of painkillers had this effect. But I have searched on NICE website but cannot find the evidence behind their press release.<br>One spokespersons for NICE said on TV news this morning that people should consult their GP but then looking rather alarmed pleaded that they don't all rush at once so as not to overload their GPs. A rather inept bit of advice. As if the community can orchestrate when they see their GP.</p> </blockquote> <h2>German week</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/germany-the-accidental-empire\">As part of our week-long series on Germany, </a> readers from the country have been sharing their experiences and thoughts on German society, lifestyle and relationships with Britain. Here is a pick of some of the best comments. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18304824\"><strong>JaneThomas</strong></a> comments on Germany and the economy: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From my experience of Berlin, I have found the Germans to be exceptionally able in administering to the needs of the public. In renting apartments there are those that one can rent if you are a visitor for only a short space of time, there are those that a student can share, there are those reserved for people on a low income and those that can be rented on an ordinary basis. If one is an artist they have the opoortunity of renting their own studio with in a complex or paying a small fee to work in the workshops of the BBK. Transport is varied and generally applied across the city and suburbs. That being said, this steady organisational capacity has begin to be undermined in the past few years by a set of rather greedy investors who wish to benefit from the relative inexpensiveness of the real estate. This will result in accomodation becoming more difficult and a decline in attractiveness for the youth that has made the city a sort-after destination.<br>Will this real-estate boom result in a similar demise that other Euro nations have suffered? Will the German people be able to sustain their economic capacity without standing on the shoulders of the rest of Europe? Or will they find that the developing nations that they have come to rely upon will develop their own capacities to export, thus resulting in declining exports from Germany?<br>Germany lies in the centre of Europe and cannot isolate itself from its neighbours. It needs them to thrive as much as they need Germany.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18300526       \"><strong>callepiedra</strong></a> on German stereotypes:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm half German, half English and knocking on 50. I work in an office in London where sexism and racism are definite no-nos. But when Germany crops up in conversation, so too do the old prejudices and stereotypes. This doesn't offend me because there's invariably no malice behind the comments. I'd say it's more in the way of a conditioned reflex or a conduit for nostalgia for an event that marks Britain's last major contribution to the flow of world history - which I guess brings us back to vfra's Vergangenheitsbewaeltigung.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18330079\"><strong>Brusselsexpats</strong> comments on hipsters in Berlin and the housing market:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can remember the days when residents of Brussels were similarly fed up with \"foreigners\" coming in and causing massive hikes in rent and property prices.<br>Back in the mists of time it was possible for every expat to move into dirt cheap and - unlike Berlin - excellent housing. As the then Common Market expanded, so did the run on property. The result meant that many Belgians on lower or middle incomes were forced to move to the outskirts of Brussels which triggered ever worsening traffic jams into the city.<br>Still housing here is still cheap compared to London (possibly anywhere is cheap compared to London).<br>A friend of mine, whose boyfriend lived in Geneva, said exactly the same thing had happened there only somewhat earlier.<br>At least older Berlin property is spacious. It could always be worse. You could be living in a shoe-box in New York with not even enough space to install a decent kitchen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Thanks for all your contributions this week.</strong></p>",
  "<p>No one has explicitly said it yet. But the suggestion that it might be time to give up on retail is starting to get louder. The latest Local Data Company report, entitled <em><a href=\"http://www.movehut.co.uk/news/ldc-report-warns-too-many-shops/\">Too Many Shops</a></em> makes it clear that we need to bring forward the prospect of alternative uses. Local authorities are already starting the process of turning empty shops into homes. And this week a <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_london_assembly/support-londons-high-streets-agenda\">Greater London Authority debate</a> suggested councils would have to kill some high streets to save others.<br> All this defeatism is against a background of growing indifference in Westminster. Where Government once loudly vowed to save the high street, there's now only the sound of wind whistling down an empty lane. Since the reshuffle of Grant Shapps there hasn't been one single high street announcement from Government. \"Business needs champions, more than ever,\" David Cameron told the country six months ago. Yet, at a time when retail, the UK's largest private sector employer, and one that contributes 20% to GDP no less, is hemorrhaging confidence, there's not so much a show of support from ministers as a resigned shrug of indifference. The recession has taken its toll here in the north west and retailers are angry at the lack of real action by Government to support the high street. In the region with the highest number of empty shops in the country no one is impressed with the Government committing less to its flagship Portas Pilot policy than Jordan Henderson's<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jordan-henderson-not-daunted-by-huge-liverpool-transfer-fee-2297000.html\"> transfer fee </a>to Liverpool.<br> Equally, no one is under any illusion that the high street model of today is sustainable. There are 46,000 empty shops and that's way too many. Yes, the model of yesterday has gone and town centres will never be the same in an era of omni-channel retailing. But that's still no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater and give up on retail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476110\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/13/1326470748653/Rochdale-Pioneers-003.jpg\" alt=\"Rochdale Pioneers\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rochdale knows all about shopping.

It's a big employer, counting for 10.5% of all jobs. In terms of youngsters it accounts for 40% of all under 20's employment. It's a sector that spends 12% of the UK's total investment in training and one that delivers value for money, with goods on average 5% cheaper than the Eurozone and clothes 20% cheaper. It's valuable to the Treasury too. Retailers make a substantial contribution to the Exchequer paying \u00a318billion from the four largest taxes alone. They use fewer Corporation Tax exemptions than other sectors and pay 28% of all business rates. There was a time when the economist Adam Smith said government should listen to our nation of shopkeepers. If Government today were to heed this advice they'd be told in no uncertain terms that bringing in the biggest business rates rise in 20 years during a recession was a foolish policy that could only do great damage to the high street. With reduced consumer spending, too many failed local authority regeneration efforts and counterproductive car parking rises, increased overheads in the form of unrealistic business rates has made retail simply no longer viable in many places. But that doesn't mean the alternative use brigade can proclaim a new beginning for our high street. If the costs have become too prohibitive for retail on our high street how do we think alternative uses can make it pay? Yes there are soft deals to be had. However, this is not sustainable for landlords in the long term. They are businesses too. Too many social enterprises and not for profit organisations with alternative uses will impact upon the nation's coffers through reduced rate income. This will ultimately impact upon front line services. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476111\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/About/General/2012/3/29/1333048931070/Mary-Portas-002.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Portas\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Portas.

Photograph: David Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we want to see diverse high streets with great shops once again at the heart of our communities then Government seriously needs to take a radical approach to business rates, which are proving to be a hindrance to entrepreneurial drive. We're becoming a nation that takes a lot in taxes but gives nothing back.<br> It's no surprise that chains like <a href=\"http://www.kurtgeiger.com/\">Kurt Geiger </a>are now looking to expand overseas because of unreasonably high business rates. For their store in Gateshead they pay \u00a3160,000 in business rates. The chief executive explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>It basically makes the store completely unviable. For a comparable store in the US and Germany, we would pay local taxes of just \u00a310,000.<br> </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Not so long ago I spoke to a retail trendspotter who works for a major department store chain. He laughed at my question about whether the Internet would signal the end of the high street:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nonsense. People will always want to go to the high street because they want to discover things and they want to be with people in a bustling environment. You can't try a dress on over the Internet. You get the 'wow moment' when you pull it off the rack.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> Retailers know this. But they know high streets have to offer a lot more than they currently do to win customers back. To do this we need Government's help to tackle empty shops. The new minister with responsibility for high streets, Mark Prisk, was formerly a small business minister who should be acutely aware of the needs and pressure on small businesses. If he brings this understanding to his new ministerial job along with a sense of urgency then there is still hope for high streets. It's time to move on from competitions and carrots and look at sustainable policy to keep our nation of shopkeepers trading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476112\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348223679311/Paul.jpg\" alt=\"paul turner mitchell\" width=\"140\" height=\"206\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://jp.twitter.com/Paul25Ten\">Paul Turner-Mitchell </a></strong>is a passionate campaigner for North West retail, whether it be taking 'shop local' campaigns to Downing Street, getting his local council to introduce free car parking or setting up an independent flagship local emporium of independent retailers.

  "<p>At their first home Premier League match this season, Chelsea, owned by the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, beat Reading 4-2 in front of 41,733 all-seated supporters whose season tickets at Stamford Bridge, apart from a small family area, cost a minimum \u00a3750. Last season's champions in Germany's Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund, began this one by beating Werder Bremen 2-1, watched by 80,645 people, including 24,454 fans in a vast standing area, paying \u20ac187 (\u00a3148) for their season tickets.</p> <p>That gulf in price and experience illustrates a profound difference in philosophy between hyper-commercialised, \"free-market\" English football and the more democratic German approach to what we used to call \"the people's game\". In both countries, football has been revitalised since the grim end of the 1980s, when 96 Liverpool supporters were killed in English football's worst disaster at Hillsborough, and average crowds in the Bundesliga sank to 17,291.</p> <p>German football has staged a recovery every bit as remarkable as that of the English game, but without surrendering some of the popular traditions, such as standing areas for fans and cheaper tickets. In 1993, contemplating outbreaks of hooliganism at Bundesliga grounds, the German FA, the Deutscher Fussball Bund, considered following England's lead and making all-seat stadiums compulsory. It decided to keep standing areas, in a statement cherished by the Football Supporters Federation in England: \"Football, being a people's sport, should not banish the socially disadvantaged from its stadia, and it should not place its social function in doubt.\"</p> <p>Just this year, the English FA told a Commons select committee for culture, media and sport inquiry that it considered issues such as ticket prices to be outside its jurisdiction. The general secretary, Alex Horne, said the FA believed in a \"free-market approach\" to club ownership.</p> <p>In Germany, the Bundesliga clubs are still large membership associations, owned and controlled by their supporters, a remarkable adherence to a mutual constitution in this hyper-commercial era. There are exceptions: Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkeusen have historically been the works teams of Volkswagen and the pharmaceutical company Bayer respectively, and Hoffenheim is owned by a software entrepreneur. The others remain associations, although most have formed a subsidiary company to run the football team itself.</p> <p>A league regulation, maintained by the clubs, holds that these football companies must be majority owned (50% plus one of the shares) by its member association. So even the mightiest of clubs, the multimillion-pound giants on the European stage Bayern Munich and Dortmund, are majority-controlled by their supporter-members. Bayern, Chelsea's opponents in last season's European Champions League final, have 185,000 members who own 82% of the football company itself; 9% stakes have been sold for vast sponsorship fortunes to the German corporate giants Audi and Adidas.</p> <p>The way the clubs work in practice varies, but all the member-owned clubs incorporate democracy. Now they are mostly structured like major German companies, with a management board running day-to-day operations, and a supervisory board appointing the directors and overseeing their performance. The members of the supervisory board are elected at an annual general meeting, at which the supporter-members, according to a 50%+1 regulation, have a permanent majority. So, the supporters exercise direct, democratic control over the great German football clubs. The management board is delegated to run the club, it in turn delegates the football decisions to a coach and their staff, and the fans turn up to watch the fruits of their labours.</p> <p>\"Football clubs are social and cultural institutions and not just businesses like any other,\" says Antonia Hagemann, head of European development at <a href=\"http://www.supporters-direct.org/\" title=\"\">Supporters Direct</a>, which campaigns for more supporter involvement in British football clubs. \"Democratic structures mean clubs are run openly and transparently; boards are held accountable, there is a certain stability in place, ownership doesn't change so democratically run clubs tend to follow a longer term vision.\"</p> <p>Three years ago, the 50% + 1 rule was challenged by Hannover 96, whose president had visions of Premier League-style stock market flotations, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2009/nov/13/bundesligafootball-bayernmunich\" title=\"\">the Bundesliga clubs solidly upheld it</a>, by 32 votes to Hannover's one (three clubs abstained).</p> <p>Jens Wagner, a Hamburg representative of the German football supporters group Unsere Kurve, which campaigned passionately for the rule to be maintained, said: \"German football is not perfect but we do not want to be like England, where the clubs are owned by one rich man who puts money in. That causes inflation and instability, and it is in the spirit of clubs for there to be democracy.\"</p> <p>Since its surprisingly late formation as a fully professional national league in 1963 (England's Football League began in 1888), the Bundesliga has incorporated financial regulations designed to encourage clubs to live within their means and not rack up huge debts. Refined over the years, this German system became the basis for Europe's governing body, Uefa, when it considered introducing its \"financial fair play\" rules, which require lossmaking clubs to move towards breaking even.</p> <p>It has not always been adhered to in Germany \u2013 Dortmund almost went bust in the late 1990s under the cost of expanding their Signal Iduna Park stadium to the huge capacity that has since been the foundation of the club's more recent success. Last year, the clubs collectively made a \u20ac52.5m (\u00a343m) profit, after tax, and reduced their liabilities, while Bayern reached the Champions League final and Bundesliga crowds, averaging 44,293, were the highest in the world.</p> <p>\"The Bundesliga is remaining true to its principles and maintaining its reliance on the factors which have made a decisive contribution to the success of the professional game in Germany in recent decades: stability, continuity and proximity to fans,\" said Dr Reinhard Rauball, the German league association president.</p> <p>Many English football supporters, offered no alternative by the Premier League and FA, look to the sporting principles maintained by the Germans with envy and admiration.</p>",

Will Arsenal pass the on-pitch test at the Etihad, and will Manchester United fans pass the off-pitch test at Anfield?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>1.00pm: <strong>Kevin is in the comments section answering questions. </strong></p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>1.14pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18400449\">objectsinmirror</a> starts thing off with a question about the English teams' performances in this year's Champions League campaign: <strong>\"Do any of them have enough make a sizeable enough impression this year?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18403196\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I know it's very early but as City have become more entertaining they may have lost a little of the resilience they had. They have lost a bit of balance between defence and attack. I enjoy watching them far more nowadays but some away games have to be handled with care. Real are not a bad team though! </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>1.23pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18403089\">Definatelynotashark</a> is concerned by Kevin's workload: <strong>\"With you doing this, the squad sheet preview, going to the game, writing the match report and a City/Arsenal in Crisis piece for Monday do you think that the Guardian Sportsblog has become a one man team?

Is the Guardian now a selling paper?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18403326\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I have the life of Riley.

With only Celtic to beat for the next three years, it could be a great way back into the Champions League.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18403457\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I wish Liverpool and others were playing in British League and coming to Glasgow. Celtic would be far richer and have better players, particularly forwards. They are the really expensive signings. Think Celtic have already had their miracle. They bought Henrik Larsson for peanuts and kept him for seven years.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>1.30pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18403375\">MrMondypops</a> asks: <strong>\"Why do you think football fans need constant reassurances from people they don't know in newspapers about how well their team are going to do?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18403511\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sadly, journalists are no different.

In practice, though, I think the Guardian posters are decent people. I speak as a reader who's been buying the Guardian for 38 years. I am privileged.

I'm a City fan and when we fell into the Europa League last year I was disappointed, which is a bit rich when we have done sweet FA in Europe for 40 odd years.

They tell me Portugal were the first to lose interest. After all, they are distinctly bigger in population than Scotland, Ireland etc.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>2.02pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18404538\">Edevhort</a> asks about the future of AC Milan: <strong>\"They have started the season disastrously, sold 20,000 season tickets for this season (San Siro capacity 80,000), and Berlusconi does not have the political or financial resources he once had. So how dark is the future for the Rossoneri?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18404650\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>You are right. The stadiums in Italy look so grim. We forget how long ago 1990 is. Everything seemed fresh and full of promise. They still have capable sides, but it all feels a bit humdrum now when I watch Serie A.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>2.04pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18404633\">reddwarf9</a> wonders when Roman Abramovich will be handing out his next P45: <strong>\"How long until Roberto Di Matteo is sacked?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18404762\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>There's no sense in pretending that anyone is safe. I must confess, too, that someone as down-to-earth as Roberto Di Matteo will be at risk if the club thinks it can conjure up a new Mourinho (or even plead with the actual Mourinho!). Villas-Boas was supposed to be the Jos\u00e9 equivalent.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>2.06pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18401417\">cavelier5</a> asks about Sunday's game at Anfield: <strong>\"It's been a pretty poisonous atmosphere in recent years, what with the tit-for-tat idiotic and downright disgusting chanting. Do you hold any hope that despite what the managers have been saying that this will be any different?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18404894\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I really think that even the morons might bite their tongues.

If so they have forfeited their basic humanity.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>2.16pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18401600\">mulliganandohare</a> asks about the role of the media at Anfield on Sunday: <strong>\"If five idiots chant 'victims' over and over, will the media blow it up out of all proportions and label Manchester United fans, and football supporters in general, neanderthal savages? Or will it be taken as read that in a crowd of 40,000, there will always be a handful of idiots, trolls, racists, loons etc and that these people should be laughed at?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18405174\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Idiocy is always possible. I would like to think that the odd drunk or lunatic will not do too much harm. Any realist knows, that you can't have vast crowds that are entirely free of morons. In fact, there is idiocy in all walks of life. Football didn't create it, although the game does suffer from it now and again.</p> <p>I still tend to think that clubs do have to act rather than keep low profile. Maybe morons are still subject to peer pressure, however. No one really wants to feel that their fellow fans think they are sick. Peer pressure is a mighty force.</p> <p>Incidentally, I am sure that, in general, grounds are far more civilised than they were when I first started going to games at the start of the 1970s.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>2.18pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18401623\">ShadowChaser</a> asks about Roberto Mancini's tactics: <strong>\"Now that Manchester City have Barry and Javi Garcia, will Yaya Tour\u00e9 be pushed further forward? Is that where Mancini sees him in future? If so, I'm getting him in my fantasy football team.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18405290\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I used to think Yaya Tour\u00e9 should play deeper but that was just me stereotyping him as someone who needs some space in which to get moving. I was very wrong. Now understand that he can do damage in congested areas too.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>2.26pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18402307\">Definatelynotashark</a> wants to know if there was violence in Reading: <strong>\"I need a Paul Doyle update, did he attack you over your pro-Trappatoni bias?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18405451\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I haven't seen Paul for a while. No doubt there will be a reckoning. As I may have said, I would be happy if Trap managed my country. I was at Scotland v Serbia recently...</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>2.33pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18404398\">bornblue</a> responds to Kevin's remark about buying the Guardian for 38 years: <strong>\"Bloody hell, very laudable and all that, but there must be a few free copies lying around the office.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18405723\">Kevin replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It's a fixation.

Daumier was a brilliant caricaturist but also something more. Born in 1808, he lived in a corrupt and revolutionary 19th-century France that offered plenty of material for the visual satires at which he excelled.

  "<p>Forget meticulous planning, management and control \u2013 a project is a temporary social system with the participation and engagement of those involved determining its success. This approach, called <a href=\"http://www.projectplace.com/about-us/social-project-management/\" title=\"\">social project management</a>, has revolutionised views about the best way to run a project. Going one step further: even the planning of a project is a social process.</p> <p>Scientific research in the past decade has taught us more about the human brain than the last one thousand years. Today, we know how people learn, what motivates them, and what makes people perform effectively in groups \u2013 these insights can be briefly summarised by saying that humans are not machines.</p> <p>Banal and obvious, certainly. But when it comes to how a project should be run, the ruling school of thought has always assumed that humans are exactly this: rational creatures through and through. If only everything in the project could be defined, planned and controlled with mathematical precision, then success would be guaranteed.</p> <p>Of course, this is not the case. People are governed by feelings and their driving forces are anything but purely rational. One of the strongest driving forces is social interaction; we want to be a part of the group, contribute and be recognised. And what is a project, if not a group of individuals working together to achieve a common goal? A project is a temporary social system.</p> <p>For a project to be successful, we need to start with the people. By applying this understanding and with the web-based collaboration tools, the likelihood of project success is increased ten-fold.</p> <h2>Involvement and commitment</h2> <p>Many of today's project models originated from the 1930s production-line thinking of large, industrial companies: top-down management to the last detail. This is not the reality of companies today. One thing we've learned over the years is that projects are more successful when the project plan is adapted to new knowledge and the new circumstances that emerge in every project. By moving your plan to the cloud it becomes a living process. After all, you can't just plan everything down to the last detail; you have to take action.</p> <p>We've also learned that planning is a social process. A crucial factor for project success is that those who do the work take part in the planning. If someone says, for example, \"In my previous project, we did things this way and it shortened the process by two weeks,\" then take advantage of that knowledge, irrespective of what was said and planned beforehand. Everyone involved in project planning also gains a better understanding of what the project is about, which in turn increases involvement and investment even more.</p> <h2>Motivation and initiative</h2> <p>The traditional way of managing a project puts a project manager at the head for planning, directing and controlling. As the central information office for the entire project, the project manager shoulders an unreasonable burden while the project members become passive and wait for instructions. The system is paralysed and ineffective.</p> <p>Collaborative planning is exactly the opposite because it is based on clear roles, transparency and participation. Project transparency means that it is crystal clear to everyone involved who has the authority to make decisions. It also means that all those involved should have access to information about important decisions taken, who took those decisions and why. No one should be excluded or allowed merely a fraction of information \u2013 yet it is virtually impossible to create transparency and openness when information is not accessible in the cloud.</p> <p>Transparency may sound frightening, but you'll find it creates trust and renders the project more people-centric. When you open up and invite people, you signal that you're secure and have confidence in everyone involved. You'll discover that people commit themselves even more, take responsibility and contribute \u2013 on their own initiative.</p> <h2>Productivity and efficiency</h2> <p>Projects should be people-centric, but technology is essential to enabling transparency and collaboration. Technology facilitates human relations and our ability to organise. <a href=\"http://www.projectplace.com/\" title=\"\">Projectplace's</a> \"digital planning board\" is one such example; it helps people view, plan and co-ordinate their work easily and playfully. Everything the team has planned, is working on and has completed is visible on the common board. Everyone is involved the whole time and can give instant feedback.</p> <p>The result is greater involvement on the part of employees who themselves develop new and more effective ways to organise the work. This is a crucial factor for success for all types of social systems. As such, it's also one of the most critical factors for success, for both projects and companies. The most exciting utilisation of new technology is when it is used in creating and maintaining human relations.</p> <h2>Conclusion: plan the social way </h2> <p>Successful projects are not the result of planning, management or control, but the outcome of motivation and involvement, which result from openness, trust and co-operation \u2013 the approach referred to as social project management. The very latest development is that even actual project planning is a social process.</p> <p>Social project management is the natural continuation of an even larger trend: social business \u2013 in other words, the business philosophy that brings knowledge about social co-operation into its operations. The social organisation is transparent in all its aspects and uses social, web-based collaboration tools to create and move the dialogue and company forward. The social approach to running companies, processes and projects is here to stay. There's no turning back; only going forward.</p> <p><em>Mattias Hallstrom is founder and head of R&amp;D at </em><a href=\"http://www.projectplace.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Projectplace International</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>There are so many dimensions to London's housing crisis I fear that the known universe cannot contain them all. Lengthening waiting lists, overcrowding, dubious landlords and, of course, the enormous cost of buying or privately renting a home in the capital are just the headings above thousands of human tales of distress, discomfort and uncertainty.</p> <p>In recent days the Guardian has reported the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/12/rental-market-london-south-east-overheating?CMP=twt_gu\">latest survey finding</a> that large numbers of Londoners (and others in the south-east) spend more than half their take home pay on rent, new data showing a huge increase in London households <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/17/homeless-families-bed-and-breakfast\">seeking temporary accommodation</a> as a result of housing benefit caps, and the remarkable fact revealed by Mayor Johnson that 170,000 potential new homes in London are not being built because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/davehillblog/2012/sep/20/boris-johnson-london-housing-crisis-andrew-boff\">the developments containing them have stalled</a>. The only people enjoying the current state of affairs are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/davehillblog/2012/sep/18/london-housing-market-boris-johnson\">very rich people from elsewhere</a>.</p> <p>The reasons for this lunacy are various and largely beyond mayoral or borough control. But are London's politicians doing all they could to counter a shortage and affordability calamity that is distorting the social character of our city and will damage its economy as well? </p> <p>The London Assembly is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/sep/20/london-private-rented-sector-duvall?newsfeed=true\">investigating the private rented sector</a>, which is good. Mayor Johnson says he's looking at ways to help get those 170,000 stalled homes finished, yet his manifesto pledges on housing issues were extremely tame. Perhaps that's just the traditional Tory pessimism at play, but it's telling, I think, that while the mayor is willing to pick fights with the government over airports and top-rate tax, his silence on housing is deafening. </p> <p><strong>The Guardian on London</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/davehillblog/2012/sep/20/boris-johnson-london-housing-crisis-andrew-boff\">London housing crisis: stalled developments</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/12/rental-market-london-south-east-overheating\">Rental market in London and the south-east is \"overheating\"</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/davehillblog/2012/sep/18/london-housing-market-boris-johnson\">London housing crisis: the market is distorted but does Boris care?</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2012/sep/17/earls-court-project-battle-endgame-is-nigh\">Earls Court project: the endgame is nigh</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/sep/20/london-private-rented-sector-duvall\">Private renting in London: a little less conversation please<br></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/heathrow-third-runway-london-referenda\">Heathrow third runway: London councils to hold local referenda</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/17/historic-debate-a-and-e-closure-plans\">Historic debate on A&amp;E closure plans</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/17/simon-harwood-sacked-gross-misconduct\">Ian Tomlinson case: PC Simon Harwood sacked for gross misconduct</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/sep/17/spitalfields-london-pictures\">In pictures: Spitalfields a century ago</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/17/hamleys-toys-sold-to-groupe-ludendo\"> Hamleys sold to French toy company</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/sep/18/video-game-art-city-hall\">London City Hall to host video game art exhibition</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2012/sep/21/royal-parks-half-marathon-st-james-park-unicef\">St James's Park: filth, thuggery and royals</a></p> <p><strong>London blogosphere</strong><br>Remember the outrageous Barnet Tory councillor Brian Coleman, who lost his London Assembly seat in May?

  "<p>It is perhaps a coincidence that just a matter of days after copies of <em>The Economist</em> landed on people's doorsteps, carrying <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21562938\">an article </a>questioning whether northern England is fast becoming a separate country from the rest, MPs this week considered the Government's plans to boost spending on infrastructure, a key ingredient to the revival of the northern economy.</p> <p>Amidst on-going economic woe, the fancily named <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/infrastructurefinancialassistance.html\">Infrastructure (Financial Assistance) Bill</a> would enable the Government to provide financial assistance of up to \u00a350 billion in support of infrastructure investment. Summarising its content, the House of Commons Library<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP12-54\"> explains</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Bill defines infrastructure widely, including not only utilities and transport facilities, but also housing, health and education facilities, and court and prison facilities. Financial assistance not only includes the provision of guarantees, but loans or \"any other kind of financial assistance (actual or contingent)\". The financial assistance can be given under the legislation not only for the construction of new infrastructure, but also for the operation and repair of existing infrastructure.</p> </blockquote> <p>For those on the Labour benches who have for so long called for such spending, it should have been music to their ears. And yet it wasn't. In the debate that followed it struck me just how much of a political football the north of England has become.</p> <p>From the blue corner came the likes of Graham Evans, the Conservative MP for Weaver Vale praising to the rafters the Government's proposals. Improvements to the Northern Hub, High Speed 2 and the potential for investment in the Mersey Gateway were just some of the positives he rattled off as he proudly declared that the legislation brought forward</p> <blockquote> <p>clearly shows that the Government are serious about growth, about rebalancing the economy, and about investing in infrastructure, especially in the north of England.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396470257\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2008/11/04/hazel130.jpg\" alt=\" Hazel Blears, Labour MP and Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hazel Blears.

Hers was a speech which focused more on the economic woe facing the north west region \u2013 unemployment higher than any other of the UK regions; the Government's flagship regional growth fund failing to achieve its desired results, and question marks over why, in its obsession with increasing air capacity in the South East the Government was failing to look at the potential of expansion at airports such as Manchester.</p> <p>Such exchanges are nothing new. As the <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/09/we-still-dont-have-enough-friends-in-the-north.html\">ConservativeHome website </a>has noted, the north is the crucial battleground for the Conservative party if it is to win an outright majority in 2015. Unsurprising, therefore, that the politics-as-usual has seen the Conservative desperately trying to play up all that they are doing for the north whilst Labour works equally hard to knock their arguments and alleged achievements down. </p> <p>That's just politics I guess, but it speaks to the fragmentation that lies at the heart of the north's problems.</p> <p>In Scotland, Alex Salmond's elevation to First Minister has kept the country very firmly in the spotlight and ensured that Ministers right across Whitehall are all too well aware of what Scottish voters want and need. Over in Northern Ireland, the existence of both a devolved Government together with cross-party unity has kept the prospects of a <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consult_rebalancing_ni_economy.htm\">devolution of corporation tax</a> a very real possibility in an effort to boost the economy.</p> <p>In the week that both Cardiff and Westminster have clashed over the future of GCSEs exams it is clear that devolution has given Wales a voice in a way it never had before, able to capture headlines and public attention on such issues.</p> <p>And then in London, we have \"BoJo\" as many in the Conservative party affectionately know him, a near permanent fixture on our TVs - and in ministers offices. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396470258\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/14/1347651813803/Boris-Johnson-002.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris.

MPs in the Commons who, during a debate on infrastructure, cannot resist the temptation to seek party political points; local authorities whose workings very few people understand, let alone knowing the names of many councillors or any of the officers who often wield the real power; and a plethora of economic bodies, such as Local Economic Partnerships which pit cities across the north against each other in the pursuit of Government funds to support growth.</p> <p>The north rejected comprehensively any notion of elected mayors in May but the blunt truth is that our current system of governance isn't working. The north simply doesn't have the clout that it should. I have lost count of the number of conferences that the same economic and political leaders turn up to time after time to go over the same ground, and I wonder what actually comes out of them? How are the lives of Mr and Mrs Average for want of a better phrase changed as a result of summits here and seminars there?</p> <p>With ministers having systematically scrapped the Regional Development Agencies across the country, it is time that our three great regions took matters into their own hands and considered the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>1. The appointment of high profile ambassadors, one each for each of our regions, given mandates by the political, economic and social communities of each, to bang the drum for investment, funding and recognition by both Whitehall and the media. </p> <p>2. A new 'grand deal' between the parties over the future development of the north. Quite simply the challenges facing us are such that they will be addressed only when a sustainable deal is struck that sees governments of all parties pursuing a consistent agenda to rebalance UK PLC and ensure that powerful eyes look north rather than south.</p> </blockquote> <p>Undoubtedly there are many other reforms that are needed, but these together would provide the bedrock for what the north so desperately needs \u2013 a united voice and a single voice to personify a region that has so much to give. </p> <p><strong>What do you think?

  "<p>The<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/11/egyptian-protesters-us-embassy-cairo\" title=\"\"> storming of the US embassy in Cairo</a> has diverted attention once again from the real issues facing Egypt. It couldn't have come at a better time for those who want to convince the Egyptian people to accept an International Monetary Fund loan, and extend former president Hosni Mubarak's liberalisation of the economy.</p> <p>While the western media and politicians seem content to view Egypt through the prism of political rights versus Islam, the economic causes of the revolution, the waves of strikes and economic demands of the activists are barely discussed.</p> <p>This allows the US and European governments to portray the $4.8bn IMF loan under negotiation, the \"assistance\" funds that will shortly start flowing into public-private \"partnerships\" and free trade zones being planned by the EU, as \"gifts\" to the Egyptian people. In recent days, highly critical rightwing commentaries about the US embassy incident have even suggested withdrawing such \"gifts\" until the Egyptian government can keep its people under control.</p> <p>The diversion into religious tension is also helpful to economic conservatives in the Egyptian administration, who are intent on pushing through the IMF loan, repaying Mubarak's odious debts and opening the country to western capital. It allows President Mohammed Morsi to stand firm against the US on issues that are more symbolic, while giving way to its economic agenda.</p> <p>The IMF agenda is not popular. When it tried to negotiate a loan with the unelected interim military government last year, it was turned down on the grounds that the resulting IMF interference would be unacceptable.</p> <p>At the time, the opposition Muslim Brotherhood said it was firmly against the loan. Today, in government, the party hierarchy is supporting it, despite serious doubts in the wider organisation, where many are rightly concerned that an IMF agenda is incompatible with Islamic principles of finance.</p> <p>The loan is also causing heated debates in Cairo's coffee shops and on the blogosphere. The IMF says it has changed its ways since working with Mubarak to restructure the Egyptian economy in the 1990s, and won't ask for many conditions this time around.</p> <p>However, many people remain sceptical about the IMF's agenda \u2013 privatisation, indirect taxation, removal of subsidies (many of which are corrupt, but some of which do genuinely support the poor) and an economy based around exports. As one government insider said last week: \"In Egypt, we call privatisation what it is \u2013 stealing.\" A propaganda campaign aims to convince Egyptians that \"there is no alternative\".</p> <p>Many of those who helped to organise the revolution are acutely aware of the need to focus on the economy.</p> <p>\"The question is not whether to take a loan, but who will run this country for the next five years,\" <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentP/4/52136/Opinion/The-IMF-loan-to-Egypt-Right-answers,-wrong-questio.aspx\" title=\"\">Amr Adly from the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights</a> told an anti-privatisation conference in Cairo. He's right because the IMF's plan is to extend and promote new loans to Egypt so that it can continue to pay (rather than question) Mubarak's debts, and use this influence to impose a whole host of liberalisation policies.</p> <p>Indeed, the IMF's plan is already moving forward. On 8 September, a team of US corporate representatives arrived in Cairo, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-05/marriott-joins-boeing-seeking-trade-assurance-on-trip-to-egypt\" title=\"\">including representatives from Boeing, Google, Exxon and Morgan Stanley</a>. The 100-strong delegation, the largest US business mission to Egypt, urged the government to adopt more business-friendly legislation. Prime Minister Hisham Qandil told them: \"We want you here to invest and make profits.\" He promised easier profit repatriation for companies coming into the country.</p> <p>Billions of dollars of \"aid\" promised by western governments are poised to flood into Egypt to begin buying the country's resources through public-private partnerships. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a public bank created to introduce the \"free market\" into post-Soviet eastern Europe, is trying to extend its mandate to north Africa.</p> <p>Certainly, Egypt's foreign currency reserves are depleting, and problems remain with its balance of payments. But it does have real alternatives. There's support \u2013 even from within the ruling party \u2013 for suspending payments on Mubarak-era debts and holding a public consultation to decide which debts should be repudiated.</p> <p>An economy that benefits Egypt's people depends on a national and regional development strategy similar to those that are being pursued in many Latin American countries. Countries such as <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/decreasing-inequality-under-latin-americas-social-democratic-and-populist-governments\" title=\"\">Ecuador and Bolivia</a> have shown that such policies not only create more growth, but lead to much fairer distribution of wealth in society and falling poverty. Incidentally, they are also much closer to Islamic ideas of what constitutes a \"just economy\" than anything being proposed by the IMF.</p> <p>In Egypt, the path to genuine development is open \u2013 in many ways, it will never offer better or clearer alternatives. But all of this will be impossible if the IMF gets its way. Ironically, the supposed political challenge to the west represented by the US embassy incident might actually help deter a much greater challenge to western power in the region represented by the <a href=\"http://www.dropegyptsdebt.org/\" title=\"\">campaign against the IMF loan</a>.</p>",
  "<p>A few months ago <a href=\"http://www.wycombewanderers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wycombe Wanderers FC</a> became supporter owned after the <a href=\"http://www.wycombewandererstrust.com/\" title=\"\">supporters trust</a> saved the club from financial turmoil by buying out the previous owner. It wasn't an easy path to take, but it was worth it.</p> <h2><strong>The story behind the takeover</strong></h2> <p>I was first introduced to the football club when a neighbour took his son and I to our old ground, Loakes Park. I was hooked from the word go.</p> <p>Many years later, the owners of the club were looking to move to a new ground with a greater capacity. With a Premiership rugby club under the same ownership, a capacity of 17,500 was required, although only around 5,000 fans watched our home games.</p> <p>Further plans emerged throughout 2011. A sports village, a hotel, residential homes and an airfield were all part of the package. We would not own the new ground. We would go from freeholder to leaseholder with the move. Our old ground would be sold. This move would take place on an extremely limited income. There was one big question. Where would we find the money to survive?</p> <p>Popular fan message board, <a href=\"http://gasroom.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Gasroom</a>, was alive with questions, speculation and opposition to the move to nearby Booker. It was from here that the <a href=\"http://notobooker.com/\" title=\"\">No to Booker</a> campaign kicked off.</p> <p>Our main demand was transparency as we wanted to understand how as a football club we would benefit from moving stadium.</p> <p>At the start we were the noisy few and it became clear we needed to be organised in order to show that not all fans were in favour of the move. Petitions were organised and a website was set up as mouthpiece for the campaign.</p> <p>As momentum increased we saw more and more fans wearing the black and white scarves \u2013 the visible symbol of the campaign which demanded answers in black and white. This was at a similar time to when Manchester United fans <a href=\"https://socialenterprise.theguardian.com/en/articles/social-enterprise-network/2012/apr/23/community-shares\" title=\"\">were saying \"no to Glazer\"</a> with their green and gold scarves.</p> <p>We quickly gained publicity through local, regional and national media. Pressure was mounting and we knew by some of the events around us that we were doing exactly the right things.</p> <p>After some months, the plans to move were scrapped. Support for the new ground had disappeared. We had won. We were part of this fantastic victory.</p> <p>But the journey didn't end there. It was never our intention to take control of the club. Wycombe Wanderers Trust was there simply to safeguard the interests of the fans \u2013 but it soon became clear that the best way to do this may be through fan ownership.</p> <p>During the campaign, I had met some of the supporters trust and admired what they stood for. I was pleasantly surprised when I was asked to stand for election to their board and was duly elected.</p> <p>A few weeks later I was away with work (I was still finding space for the day job) when, stood on a balcony in Cannes, I got a text updating me on developments back home.</p> <p>For me, this was where the rollercoaster really started. I agreed to sign an non-disclosure agreement (NDA) which if broken would have finished me. Safe to say there were no leaks, which is testament to those involved. Negotiations had begun before and we all were now participating.</p> <p>There were countless meetings, phone calls, emails and frustrations, and at times it felt like it would never be completed. But on Friday 29 June 2012 we finally did it. We owned our club.</p> <p>Twitter lit up, the Gasroom lit up, as did Facebook. I cannot say that the previous owner had anything but good intentions. It is difficult to know what happened behind the scenes, but he is now a fan and always welcome.</p> <h2><strong>Running the club</strong></h2> <p>On day one it was a question of \"where do you start?\" Basics first. The business has to operate to fund a football team, not the other way around. We have set the budget and luckily the manager, Gary Waddock has always known where we are coming from.</p> <p>Off the pitch, we had a plan. Operate and cut the losses. Move to a position where we can cover our costs and any profit will go to the playing budget. The senior team had some tough decisions to make. The business had to come first and we've been determined to make this work.</p> <p>We are a small club and are part of the community and because of this our structure is very different to other clubs. The joint chairman and I are as happy talking to fans of both teams in the bars or car parks as we are in the board room.</p> <p>On a match day I may sort out your problem, or direct you to your parking space. Deals are not in the directors box, they are in and from the community and you must engage with them.</p> <p>Our fans are such a massive part of the club and we work for them.</p> <p>We have no shareholders \u2013 maybe a little debt, but that is manageable. We will be in the black in the next few years.</p> <p>As for me, I have the best job in the world. My wife Louise sees the passion I have for the club I've supported since 1978, when I was five, and how determined I am to make a success of the club.</p> <h2><strong>Advice to others</strong></h2> <p>I believe the model of fan ownership will increase over the coming years. If you get the opportunity, go in with your eyes open and look at everything. Form your own opinions and trust your instincts.</p> <p>There is plenty of help out there. Advice from Supporters Direct has proved to be invaluable and they are always available for help, advice and support. Talk to other trusts and clubs, especially those who have been through the same process.</p> <p>Identify the key issues, look at your funding models and make sure that you don't rely on one source. Football is not sexy in the financial markets. Ensure that you have an excellent team around you who you trust 100%. It won't work otherwise.</p> <p>Set your long-term goals and make sure they are achievable. Benchmark these against other clubs and keep a very close eye on the competition such as local pubs, venues and other clubs. Be sure to keep up.</p> <p>Be welcoming and adapt. Don't rip people off for a cup of tea, for instance, and encourage fans to get to the ground early. Disposable income may be less but allow fans the choice to spend it with you and to ultimately progress together.</p> <p>Keep thinking fresh and share ideas, seek improvements and action them. Empower and train people, encourage responsibilities and develop together.</p> <p>And finally, business basics first \u2013 football can follow \u2013 and don't forget to budget, budget and budget. Don't chase the dream, lead it.</p> <p><em>Matt Clarke is director and fan of </em><a href=\"http://www.wycombewanderers.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Wycombe Wanderers FC</em></a><em> Limited.

  "<p>My day begins with an interview with a child whose parents are separating. There's been a heated dispute between Mum and Dad about how much contact each parent has with their son and when, which has led to them approaching the family court for help.</p> <p>I need to find out what arrangement would be in his best interests. Firstly, what will keep him safe, and ideally, what will keep him happy.</p> <p>I need to make sure he feels comfortable speaking to me. In private law cases, which consist mainly of separating parents, children can carry a lot of baggage from their families. In public law, where it's often a question of whether or not a child will go into care due to an abusive or unsafe situation at home, children have usually spoken to other social workers and can be quite well-rehearsed in what they say to me.</p> <p>I need to break through these barriers to ensure I can see the full picture of what life is really like for these children.</p> <p>Sometimes I need games or props to help make that necessary connection. Today, the child I'm talking to is quite young and particularly reluctant to be drawn out.</p> <p>To help things along, I give him one of a collection of little soft toy animals I carry with me. I start a conversation with the bear, asking it questions and having it respond to me. Soon he starts speaking to the bear as well. That gets a dialogue going. We don't discuss anything pertaining to the case for a while, but the technique starts a flow of communication and that's when I can ease us into a more serious conversation.</p> <p>Prior to contact with a child in each case, I speak to all parents and carers involved. While it's my job to advocate for the child only, I need to make sure I understand the wider context and narrative of every case I handle.</p> <p>Cafcass ensures that the court is aware of information from the police and local authority that highlights any child protection issues, past or present. Sometimes we recommend that the court orders additional checks, such as psychological assessments or tests for substance misuse in parents, to ensure that we and the court have a complete picture of a case.</p> <p>After the morning interview, I grab some lunch and head back to my home office where I start writing a report to present my recommendations about the case to court. These recommendations are based on all the evidence I have gathered through interviews and official checks. The report outlines the child's wishes and feelings, ensuring their voice is not lost in proceedings.</p> <p>In my reports, I always try to remind judges that the child needs to be at the centre of any decision \u2013 sometimes I humanise children by including a photograph. Other times I enclose a letter they have written and asked me to give to the judge. Today, I'm enclosing a picture the child has drawn.</p> <p>On other days, when I'm working on public law cases, I always keep in mind that my job is separate to that of a local authority social worker's. My role as a guardian in such cases is to advocate for the child, and to make sure that the local authority's plans are safe and suitable. If I spot any child protection concerns or other issues that fall within the local authority social worker's remit, I contact the relevant children's services department immediately.</p> <p>The rest of my day is spent looking into other cases on my caseload as well as assisting and supporting other family court advisers with their cases. As an enhanced practitioner, I'm qualified to mentor others. My remit across both public and private law really helps with this part of my job.</p> <p>To unwind at the end of the day, I indulge in my other passion, which is writing. I regularly write book reviews for the British Association of Social Workers but this evening, I'm working on some research I'm assisting the University of Nottingham with, which relates to child engagement and participation in justice.</p> <p>There are times when my job can be harrowing. What keeps me going is the positive affirmation I receive from so many of the children I work with. I have boxes of pictures and notes that children have made for me, saying things like \"Thank you for listening to me\", \"Thank you for letting me talk to the judge\" or \"I'm happy I get to see Daddy now\".</p> <p>Hearing it directly from the children makes me know I'm making a positive difference.</p> <p><em>If you know a role or someone who you would like to see featured in our a day in the life of ... series then get in touch by </em><a href=\"mailto:jessica.fuhl@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>emailing us</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>James Murdoch is reportedly being lined up to run News Corporation's Fox TV business in the US despite being sharply criticised by British broadcasting regulator Ofcom on Thursday.</p> <p>The role being discussed would put him in charge of the Fox Networks Group, which includes the Fox terrestrial TV network as well as cable channels such as FX and National Geographic, says a report in the Financial Times.</p> <p>Murdoch had hoped the promotion, which would return him to pole position to take over from his father and to run the TV business when News Corp demerges it from its newspapers next year, would have been announced in July.</p> <p>Sources told the FT that the new role had been formalised but Rupert Murdoch resisted the announcement.</p> <p>Another source cited said that News Corp could not countenance announcing the expanded role in July until there was a better idea about what would happen in London, where potentially damaging Ofcom and Leveson inquiry reports were still on the horizon.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/sky-broadcast-james-murdoch-criticised\" title=\"\">Ofcom declared BSkyB \"fit and proper\" to own broadcast licences, but the regulator was highly critical of James Murdoch's</a> handling of the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>It found that Murdoch's conduct in relation to News Group Newspapers \"repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of a chief executive and chairman\" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was \"difficult to comprehend and ill-judged\".</p> <p>If Murdoch ascends to the new role, there would be a new reporting structure at News Corp with Peter Rice, the Los Angeles-based head of News Corp's lucrative Fox Networks, reporting directly to him.</p> <p>Rice was promoted to this role in July and Murdoch had hoped his father would rubber stamp the deal then.</p> <p>The move gave Rice control of all programming of the Fox Networks Group, including Fox Sports, Fox International and National Geographic channels. However, Fox News, run by Roger Ailes, remains a separate business.</p> <p>In London, the phone-hacking scandal and its fallout will continue to cast a shadow over News International for some time. Lord Justice Leveson's final report on the future of press regulation is still to come, there are several hundred more civil damages cases to settle next year, and the Metropolitan police investigations into alleged criminality at the publisher and any resulting prosecutions could continue for up to three more years.</p> <p>Tensions are running high at Murdoch's favourite paper, the Sun, over the mounting number of arrests of journalists. On Thursday afternoon, the chief executive of News International, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/news-international-sun-journalist-arrest\" title=\"\">Tom Mockridge, called an unexpected staff meeting to try to boost morale</a>.</p> <p>The meeting was called after the third Sun journalist in two days was arrested in relation to Operation Elveden, the Met police inquiry into alleged payments to police and other officials for stories, and to Operation Tuleta, the police investigation into alleged computer hacking which was recently widened to include alleged criminal breaches of privacy.</p> <p>In all, 21 journalists at the Sun have now been arrested.</p> <p>According to one staff member who was at the meeting, Mockridge is very uneasy about the continuing role of the management and standards committee, the internal inquiry unit that set up by News Corp to clear Wapping of all alleged criminal practices.</p> <p>Mockridge told Sun staff that he had \"no date\" for when the arrests would end and said the company continued to co-operate with the Metropolitan police, as agreed by parent company News Corp.</p> <p>He said it was up to News Corp, not News International, to decide when to end co-operation with the police.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Coming out at work is probably one of the most empowering things I've ever done in my career. But deciding to do so was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made.</p> <p>I'd separated from my wife in 2003 and came out to friends and family shortly thereafter, but fear kept me living only part of a life. It wasn't until 2007 that I felt able to tell people at work that I was gay \u2013 and I can honestly say I've not looked back since. Today \u2013 without fear \u2013 I assume greater responsibility because I feel more able to achieve success.</p> <p>Stumbling across IBM's LGBT employee network was the catalyst I needed. If you're in a similar situation, and scared to come out, it's important to find out what your employer offers in terms of general diversity and LGBT-specific network groups. Check out your organisation's intranet to see what you can find; you may be surprised at how much support is out there. Once you know where the resources are, reach out to them (even if it's on a confidential basis) to find out more \u2013 again, you may be surprised at what you learn.</p> <p>If you're still concerned, consider this: no company wants to be seen as discriminatory in any way. Therefore, if you feel discriminated against by taking the brave step of coming out at work you will nearly always find a means of addressing this situation within your organisation.</p> <p>You may also be worried about dealing with clients or external parties \u2013 often one of the hardest aspects of being authentic at work. Discussing your concerns with your managers can help immeasurably, as having them on your side will provide the voice and support you need. You'll be surprised at how many managers are willing to go to bat for you once they know and appreciate your concerns.</p> <p>So why take the step when so many people seem to think that one's sexuality has nothing to do with one's job?</p> <p>The truth is that the lack of authenticity, which comes with hiding your sexuality, can do you a disservice at work. You could appear reserved or distracted when dealing with your colleagues and may not bring your full self to the table to deal with work's challenges. This can have obvious effects on how you are treated by colleagues, as well as restrict your motivation and creative abilities, impacting on your overall performance.</p> <p>Coming out can also have positive ramifications on one's career. In my case, identifying myself as gay led me to be selected by HR internal talent assessments for specific leadership training. This training has helped me transform my leadership capabilities, making me a far more confident and motivated employee and leader. As a member of our LGBT community, I've also become a mentor for a straight member of IBM's UK executive leadership team, providing me with further opportunities to share insights and influence the organisation at a higher level.</p> <p>I realise that the kind of support I've received from IBM is sadly not available to everyone. But it should be. If your organisation doesn't create an environment where everyone feels welcome, it won't be successful in the long term. I wholeheartedly believe that the more someone is allowed to be themselves, the better they are able to do their job.</p> <p>Competition for talent is a huge issue for industry. Companies that do not offer a work environment where people are comfortable about their sexual orientation will limit their ability to recruit the best talent. They will not only fail to hire high calibre LGBT candidates, but also straight candidates who value a diverse and inclusive workplace.</p> <p><em>Vince Cipollone is the corporate development executive at </em><a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/uk/en/\" title=\"\"><em>IBM</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Details are fast emerging of the web of corruption spun by the Colombian cocaine trafficker Daniel \"El Loco\" Barrera to cover the traces of his empire. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/colombian-drug-kingpin-captured-venezuela?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Barrera was arrested on Wednesday morning</a> \u2013 by that evening Colombian anti-drugs police had begun forfeiting the 500 front companies, property investments and small businesses that Barrera used to launder the vast sums he made from cocaine smuggling over the past 20 years.</p> <p>Barrera was one of Colombia's biggest traffickers. The Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, called him \"the last of the great capos\". His arrest is being celebrated in Colombia as a second major blow to the traffickers, coming three months after Venezuelan authorities arrested another big name cocaine trafficker, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18320086\" title=\"\">Diego Perez Henao</a>, aka Diego Rastrojo.</p> <p>But while Santos has good reason to be cheered, future court hearings are likely to raise awkward questions about how the capos avoided detection for so long, as well as the efficacy of the war on drugs.</p> <p>Barrera and Rastrojo are part of the second generation of Colombian cocaine traffickers, who learned how to duck under the radar of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in the years following the death of Pablo Escobar in 1993. Both were adept at striking production and trafficking agreements not only with the Farc guerrillas, but the rightwing paramilitary armies that sprang up to combat them in the 1990s.</p> <p>Colombia's civil war predates the cocaine business by at least 50 years. But thanks to the cocaine business, its illegal armed groups have been kept afloat and all attempts at negotiating a lasting peace have ended in failure.</p> <p>Until recently, the DEA and the Colombian army focused their efforts on the Farc. Under the auspices of Plan Colombia, which Bill Clinton signed off in 1999, Colombia's army and police have received billions of dollars from Washington. This has funded a dramatic expansion of their reach and effectiveness. Colombia's eastern plains, where Barrera and Rastojo were based, were home to several Farc fronts and paramilitary groups in 1999. Now they are largely in the hands of the army.</p> <p>But military solutions to the cocaine business have displaced, rather than weakened it. As aerial fumigation planes drive coca yields down in Colombia, the slack has been taken up by growers elsewhere. Cultivation has been driven into the isolated Andean valleys of southern Colombia, where the Farc and paramilitary units such as the Black Eagles continue to fight for control of the business. As the army goes after them, cultivation has moved to Peru and Bolivia.</p> <p>President Santos has admitted that this \"balloon effect\" renders any triumphalism premature. His ambassador to the UK, Mauricio Rodriguez, says that for anti-drugs initiatives to be effective, more needs to be done to tackle money laundering \u2013 a welcome change of tack.</p> <p>In their rush to fight a \"war on drugs and terrorists\", the White House insists that the \"narco-guerrillas\" are the biggest cartel of them all. The money trail certainly leads into the coffers of the Farc. But the paramilitaries have benefitted from drug money to an even greater extent than their enemies, and through them the money trail ultimately leads to the many local politicians and business owners in Colombia who fund and are funded by cocaine smuggling.</p> <p>It is a grotesque irony of the \"war on drugs\" that law enforcement seems to embed rather than uproot the cocaine business. Most traffickers saw the weaknesses inherent in the cartel model after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar\" title=\"\">Pablo Escobar</a> was gunned down on a Medellin rooftop 19 years ago. Today there are thousands of mini-cartels at work in Colombia, each handling a single stage in the production cycle. They know little about their suppliers or clients, which means that when they are busted, they can implicate nobody and the link in the chain is quickly bridged.</p> <p>Colombia certainly produces less cocaine than it did when Plan Colombia came into effect in 1999. The Colombian end of the business is considerably less violent and Colombian investors are rushing back to Medellin and Cali. This gives some cheer to Colombians, as well as foreign investors and tourists, who are travelling to one of the most beautiful countries in Latin America in increasing numbers.</p> <p>But the \"war on drugs\" has taught Colombian narcos another trick: better to leave the riskiest and most lucrative stage \u2013 smuggling cocaine into the US \u2013 to the Mexicans. As a result, Mexican cities such as Nuevo Laredo, which was relatively peaceful in 2002, are now a war zone. Thus, another victory for those striving for a \"drug-free world\" inadvertently leads to another blow for law enforcement somewhere else on the route between drug producer and drug consumer.</p> <p>There is still no prospect of achieving what the \"war on drugs\" set out to achieve: driving up prices so much that cocaine users can no longer afford the stuff. Instead, President Santos's success in fighting the cocaine business has only shunted it into countries with worse-funded armies and police forces.</p> <p>As another drug kingpin bites the dust, we shouldn't be diverted from admitting the unintended consequences of successful police work. Somewhere in Colombia's eastern plains, Daniel Barrera's lieutenants will be vying to take his crown. Mexico's capos will be awaiting his call.</p>",
  "<p>This book is all about a boy called George, his friend Annie and her dad Eric (a scientist) and their adventures in space. They travel there by a super computer Cosmos. In this adventure, Annie has a message from aliens and she and George travel into space with their friend Emmett at Ground Control to find out what's going on.</p> <p>It was an exciting read.

  "<p>The regulatory framework for social housing marks out tenant scrutiny as the principal way of ensuring housing providers deliver good consumer service standards. So how serious are we about co-regulation in social housing?</p> <p>Tenant scrutiny is an example of a wider expansion in community empowerment where service users are armed with the authority and instruments to challenge service providers, helping to redress the imbalance of power between users and providers of public services. It mirrors the balance of power in local government, where executive cabinets are scrutinised by strong, independent backbenchers.</p> <p>Scrutiny mechanisms today are philosophically very different than envisaged in Shelley Arnstein's seminal \"ladder of participation\" laid out 40 years ago. The conventional ladder sees communities, including social tenants, acquiring successively increased levels of control over their own services as they climb up the rungs, reaching community control at the figurative top step.</p> <p>So we have two very different routes to empowerment. The first, involving co-production, is like residents climbing the stairs of some multi-storey castle, acquiring ever greater authority over services and arriving at the boardroom on the top floor, as tenant board directors controlling their own organisation. Models such as tenant management or co-operative housing ownership would see tenants as \"kings of the castle\", owning their own assets.</p> <p>Co-regulation through tenant scrutiny is qualitatively different. It's more like scaling the ramparts \u2013 a form of external challenge to the castle of control. The purpose is not to capture overall control, but to challenge it from without. Tenant scrutiny is deliberately separated and at arms length from boards of management and ownership, a regulatory influence on the controlling authority but not a means for usurping or seizing control itself.</p> <p>Scrutiny has a theoretical philosophical underpinning. Aristotle's belief that knowledge is advanced through thesis (an idea) being challenged by antithesis (a competing alternative) and resulting in synthesis (knowledge advanced through the best of each). This model only works if the thesis is exposed to a full-blooded antithetical challenge \u2013 a conflict between broadly equal forces out of which some better equilibrium emerges.</p> <p>But building up, empowering and then letting loose scrutinisers is dangerous. Do housing providers really want this? Unpredictable, volatile, uncontrollable and explosive reactions are likely to occur. Who is brave enough to risk that when a quieter, more amicable relationship can be manufactured? A tamed scrutiny on a leash? Housing managers will surely be tempted.</p> <p>By co-opting scrutiny, or by diluting it or incorporating it within the status quo, we emasculate it and debilitate its potential to create the sometimes stormy dynamic tension of conflict, from which innovation and transcendent solutions are formed.</p> <p>Housing providers are now on the cusp. How will they respond? Are we serious about tenant scrutiny? Or will it become a placatory or manipulative tool, the bottom level of the ladder of participation?</p> <p>The consultation is over. We are now about to witness the reality, and the next 12 months will be decisive in determining to which of these destinies tenant scrutiny is consigned.</p> <p><em>Dr Bob Pocock is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.m-e-l.co.uk/about-m%C2%B7e%C2%B7l.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>M-E-L Research</em></a><em> and a Labour councillor for Sutton Vesey ward in Birmingham </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis, best practice and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Overshadowed somewhat by the arrival of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/sep/18/mark-prisk-pledges-work-housing-sector\" title=\"\">new housing minister</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/video/2012/sep/20/nhf-housing-network\" title=\"\">Yes to Homes</a> campaign, another important commitment was made at the National Housing Federation conference this week. At a conference fringe event, Women in Social Housing (Wish) relaunched after 10 years, set out its ambitions for a second decade.</p> <p>Established to promote career progression for women in housing, challenge stereotypes and remove the barriers to promotion and leadership, it now also aims to encourage more women to choose careers in the affordable housing and construction industries when leaving school, college and higher education.</p> <p>It's 300-strong membership and bold vision are a testament to the great progress that women have made in the sector, and to the inspiring leadership of visible figureheads such as Grainia Long of the Chartered Institute of Housing, Incommunities' Geraldine Howley and Ann Santry at Sovereign.</p> <p>What a shame, then, that I counted just two men at the launch \u2013 and one of them a fellow journalist. Speaking at the event, Howley, who has risen from receptionist in a council housing team to group chief executive of a large stock transfer landlord, spoke movingly about her career. Two things had proved critical, she said: mentoring and flexibility.</p> <p>Howley credited her early success to a male member of staff who took her in hand, advised her and fed her enthusiasm and ambition. He taught her to believe that she could do it. Later, the local authority she worked for set a new precedent for its staff by granting a job-share arrangement with a colleague \u2013 allowing Howley the time and space she needed to bring up her family while retaining significant responsibility in her career. \"If that hadn't happened, I'd probably have thought just forget it,\" she explained.</p> <p>Let's not forget how things have changed; when Howley was first appointed as a housing officer she was the only woman on the team and was placed on a coffee rota with administrative staff, and called back from the estates she helped manage to make a round when it was her turn. Now women are represented across housing organisations, but there are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/editors-blog/2012/mar/09/editor-women-top-social-housing?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">still too few at the top</a>.</p> <p>European legislation looks likely to require member countries to set targets for the percentage of women on top boards \u2013 and levy fines on those who fail to achieve them, all within the next year. But as Wish itself stresses, there's no point waiting for regulation. Housing should act first, and to do this we need male leaders to share the same ambition for women.</p> <p>When there are so many barriers to careers in construction and housing \u2013 not least the ongoing sexist attitudes around men's and women's work that still exist in our society \u2013 it's not acceptable to sit back and let women fight for themselves. With the majority of housing chief executives still men (and white, and middle class \u2013 but that's an issue that deserves the space of a separate post), it is up to those men to make change happen.</p> <p>Wish can help its members to advance their own careers, through networking, skills training and personal support. But I'd urge men in social housing, particularly those in senior positions, to take a look at the group too and ask what they can do to help achieve equality in the sector, today and for future generations of housing staff.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>\"Days are where we live.\" <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Philip Larkin</a>'s line is one that seems to resonate with Chris Ware's new graphic novel.

They vary from pamphlets each page of which are around A2-sized, to a single narrow strip of paper, zigzag folded. A couple are bound in cloth or cardboard. They can be read in any order: and in combination they describe the lives of the inhabitants of a three-story building in Chicago.</p> <p>On the ground floor is the lonely old spinster who owns the building and rents out the apartments above, dreaming her way through memories of a life barely lived at all. The middle floor is home to a youngish woman whose boyfriend is routinely horrible to her. The top floor is home to the main protagonist, who at first lives there on her own but will go on to move out into suburbia as a young mother. Having once dreamed of writing and painting, she is staled in domesticity: putting on weight, beset with anxiety, frustrated with her husband. She loves her daughter but still pines for her first boyfriend, who abandoned her after an abortion. She wonders where her life has gone.</p> <p>That is not to forget, incidentally, the two comics dedicated to \"Branford, The Best Bee In The World\". Branford, a bee whose hive is outside the apartment building, is the only male point of view we inhabit. Given the sexual politics of bees that's a wan Ware joke. This is ostensibly a book about buildings but it's more quietly, too, a book about women's lives.</p> <p>Somewhere in the ancestry of this volume you can detect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jan/08/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Will Eisner's</a> tenement stories, but it couldn't be further from the roustabout resilience of Eisner's work. When you read a Chris Ware comic you can be fairly sure that you'll end up with a migraine from the tiny writing, or suicidal from the worldview, and yet he's so damn good you do it anyway. It's impossible to overstate how meticulously his work hangs together: the symmetries on a single page; the motifs that worm through it; the multiple counterpointed stories.</p> <p>The building frames and encloses the lives of its protagonists. Days are where we live, and buildings are where we live, and \u2013 in Ware's comics \u2013 panels are where we live. Ware's style, accordingly, includes strong elements of graphic design and architectural drawing. He frequently uses isometric projection, or even flat-on 2D. His panels are rigidly, confiningly regular: squares or rectangles, boxing in his tiny characters and their tiny problems.</p> <p>Human figures are drawn with extreme economy \u2013 always on the verge of being potato-heads with dots for eyes. Yet through this almost diagrammatic style, he manages to achieve something like documentary realism: he captures the exact way a cat curls up on a bed, or arches its back when it hears a tin of tuna being opened on the countertop; the exact way that a toddler will climb up and out of its high-chair; the weight in people's bodies and how they carry it. An overweight woman pushing a baby buggy says \"huf\"; a cat about to be sick says: \"gkq\". These panels are crammed with everyday truth.</p> <p>It is a clich\u00e9 \u2013 and a slight inanity, come to that \u2013 to say of a comics writer that he extends the possibilities of the medium. But you find yourself wanting to say something close to it about Ware: he is so attuned to the possibilities of the medium, so completely in control of what he's doing, that he finds expressive potential in it that you simply couldn't have anticipated.</p> <p>Think how much harder it would be to capture in prose \u2013 without bringing it too pointedly into the foreground \u2013 the pervasive presence of smartphones and tablet computers, for instance. Yet here they are everywhere: distracting, absorbing, disconnecting. Husband and wife sit across from each-other at the table, each on their own laptop.</p> <p>One panel \u2013 which could stand for many more \u2013 shows Ware's heroine standing naked beside the bed, arms by her sides, her underwear pooled on the floor beside her, as if offering herself. She looks on the verge of tears and her eyes are fixed dead ahead. On his back on the bed, naked, genitals flaccid against one thigh, her husband is reading an iPad propped on his sternum, the glow painting his chest and face. He shows no sign of having noticed her at all.</p> <p>\"God!\" (or, as it's more wearily rendered on the opening panel of one of the sections, \"god ...\") sounds quietly through these stories. It's always a stock syllable of exasperation or dismay, but the idea that it could also be an appeal, or a cry for help <em>de profundis</em>, just distantly ghosts its meaning.</p> <p>Only in the tragicomic universe of Branford the bee can any sort of yearning for transcendence be expressed. He's forever being beaten up by the other bees, he loves his wife but can't stop fantasising about fertilising the queen, and when trapped in a windowpane or an old fizzy drink can undergoes a dark night of the soul. But for Branford, flowers are the \"eyes of god\" \u2013 and he babbles his idiot devotion. Some good it does him.</p> <p>There's nobody else doing anything in this medium that remotely approaches Ware for originality, plangency, complexity and exactitude. Astonishment is an entirely appropriate response.</p> <p>\u2022 Sam Leith's <em>You Talkin' to Me? </em>is published by Profile.</p>",
  "<p>It is often said,and usually true, that by the time the world becomes fascinated with a particular trend, then those at the cutting edge have already invented the next big thing.</p> <p>The hot device on the stands for the 50,000 television executives at this month's IBC broadcasting technology get-together in Amsterdam was the connected TV, but the true trendsetters were discussing connecting everything. That is, not just syncing your laptop or your mobile to your favourite TV programme, but how to create a new eco-system of connectivity that will involve most of the electronic devices in the home, including the fridge.</p> <p>Among those thinking this was the new executive vice-president of global media for Samsung Electronics, David Eun, who gave his first official appearance in his new role at IBC where he fleshed out an all-embracing vision with, of course, Samsung devices at its heart.</p> <p>As the head of the new global media group and an adviser to the president of Samsung's mobile group, Eun is a leader in the concept of creating a new means of electronic distribution that encompasses more than just the obvious communication devices. Currently, the hype is about all the entertainment screens (such smartphones and laptops and, increasingly, televisions) being connected to the internet, but Eun sees a bigger picture \u2013 all of those devices and more being connected to the internet and to each other.</p> <p>Samsung is not the only consumer electronics firm to be thinking beyond hardware \u2013 LG and Sony have also launched smart TVs loaded with apps as well. But Eun is well-placed to have this kind of a strategic vision because Samsung sells a lot of screens: it has been the leading seller of TVs for seven years now, which is more than Sony, and in the US Samsung sells more each year than its next three competitors combined. The company has also more recently become a powerhouse in mobile phones, outselling Apple's iPhone for several quarters, which has only added to the acrimony between the two companies over patent disputes, especially since the recent US court decision this summer that went against Samsung, awarding Apple $1bn in damages. Samsung's latest smartphone, the Galaxy 3S, shipped 20m in its first 100 days, while Apple's new iPhone 5 sold out online two days after its 12 September launch.</p> <p>Eun won't discuss the patent suit, saying that he sees his job to build on Samsung's device distribution prowess. \"All these screens are connected to the internet but they are not yet all connected to each other,\" he said. \"Once we connect all these devices to each other we will effectively have one of the world's largest platforms for distribution content, services and advertising.\"</p> <p>The question is can Samsung create an \"ecosystem\" of software, hardware, services and customer support with the same kind of success as Apple? According to David Mercer, vice-president of digital consumer practice at Strategy Analytics, Samsung has not yet proven that purchasers of its TVs will also remain loyal to the brand enough to also purchase a Samsung tablet and mobile phone. \"The different branches of the company need to work better together in consumers' minds,\" said Mercer.</p> <p>Eun, a 45-year-old Korean-American and a former executive at AOL, Google and NBC, was employed by Samsung only in January, but has since begun to set out his stall to help take the South Korean electronics giant in a new strategic direction in terms of its future focus. Of course, Samsung will continue to manufacture and innovate its hardware products \u2013 it spent $9bn on R&amp;D last year alone \u2013 but he is also thinking about the company's software developments and he's been meeting with companies and creatives around the world to match up relevant content and services that can be tapped into via the company's own device network. He is also talking about making some strategic investments in companies with services or software that will help build up the appeal of Samsung devices. He said he spends as much time in New York and Silicon Valley as we does in Korea and clearly with the trip to Amsterdam he is looking at Europe as well for both partnerships and acquisitions to build on the approximately 2,000 apps that Samsung already has on its \"Smart Hub\" on its connected TVs. \"Samsung hasn't had to do lots of acquisitions historically because of its scale and share of talent,\" Eun said. \"But acquiring other companies is a way for us to accelerate our entry into the content services space.\"</p> <p>Eun talks a lot about the \"power of the distribution network\", ie the ability to sell lots of devices quickly. One reason for this is that Samsung has embraced a more \"open\" ecosystem than Apple in terms of its approach to payment and content, using both Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows 8 as well as a new alliance with Intel called Tizen, which is an HTML 5-based platform for apps. \"At Samsung I have understood the importance of distribution and the importance of proximity to the user,\" said Eun. \"One the things that has blown me away about the opportunity is that Samsung creates more devices \u2013 and so we have more touch points with consumers \u2013 than virtually any other company on the planet.\"</p> <p>And for Eun it's not just the usual TV and phone suspects he is talking about, but other white goods products like refrigerators and windows, which Samsung also makes. \"We already have windows that are also displays and they have virtual shades,\" explained Eun. \"There is a world, and it is not far away, where the mirror above the sink in the bathroom is a display and is connected to all the other devices that we make.\" Eun says that he already can see the day when his young kids say to him: \"Daddy do you really mean you used paper and magnets on the refrigerator to communicate with Mom? Why didn't you just put a screen there?\"</p> <p>With his background in Silicon Valley, Eun is also keen to see the TV set evolve into a more easily updateable device and he spoke at IBC about Samsung's development of an \"evolution kit\" for that will be used to upgrade TVs already in the market to move them more to the kind of replacement cycle more typical of smart phones, laptops and tablets. \"Our TV sets are increasingly modular,\" said Eun.</p> <p>Samsung may be thinking outside of the box about connectivity ideas for the near future, but the company is certainly not alone. The demand for smart technology devices is increasing almost exponentially \u2013 the demand for connected devices is booming, while second-screen app providers like Shazam and Zeebox are causing a stir in terms of pushing the current boundaries of connected and socialized content. \"Regardless of where you start now \u2013 on the content or on the hardware side \u2013 you need to understand both,\" said Eun. \"There is no silver bullet but there are important paths to pursue and that's what we are doing.\"</p> <p><em>Kate Bulkley is a journalist and media commentator.

  "<p>Europe's antitrust chief has publicly warned Google that it could face charges of breaching EU rules, and be fined, unless it does more to ease concerns that it used its search clout to block rivals.</p> <p>EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that so far concessions from Google \u2013 which is in talks with the European Commission to resolve complaints from competitors, including Microsoft, which claim it is abusing its dominant position in the search business \u2013 had not gone far enough.</p> <p>His warning, <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/12/629&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en\" title=\"\">made in a speech to Fordham University in New York</a>, ratchets up the pressure on Google by making public the EC's willingness to move to a more confrontational approach to the negotiations, which have been going on since July.</p> <p>If the case moved to the courts and the EC showed that Google had broken EU antitrust laws through the abuse of a dominant position, Google could be fined 10% of its worldwide revenues \u2013 which for 2011 amounts to \u20ac2.9bn (\u00a32.3bn).</p> <p>More importantly, Google would be put into a legal straitjacket that would control how it could in future use its search results \u2013 rather as Microsoft, which previously fell foul of the EC over the dominant position of its Internet Explorer browser, now finds itself.</p> <p>In Europe, Microsoft is obliged to offer a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/02/microsoft\" title=\"\">browser choice screen</a> that lets users choose which of a number of browsers they wish to be the default on their PC.</p> <p>Speaking about the Google negotiations, Almunia said in his speech: \"We are not there yet, and it must be clear that, in the absence of satisfactory proposals in the short term, I will be obliged to continue with our formal proceedings.</p> <p>\"If effective solutions were found quickly and tested successfully, competition could be restored at an early stage.\" He said that his staff was in technical discussions with Google to assess in-depth the solutions presented to his office.</p> <p>Observers of the negotiations note that so far interested parties, such as those who first complained to the EC in 2010 alleging that Google was abusing its dominant position in the search market, have not seen any market testing of potential solutions. That seems to indicate slow progress.</p> <p>By going public with his unhappiness over the progress of the talks, Almunia seems to be raising the stakes in the discussions.</p> <p>Google was given, and met, a 2 July deadline by Almunia's office to respond to a statement of concerns about the way in which it orders search results to include its own products such as YouTube or Google Shopping, about the scraping of content from third-party sites, the export of advertising campaigns from Google's system and the placement of rival advertising on Google properties.</p> <p>Crucially it did not say what, if any, concessions it had offered, especially over the ordering of search results.</p> <p>Almunia has said he wants the proposals to be valid worldwide. The US Federal Trade Commission is also considering whether to open a similar case against Google, especially relating to the placement of its own products in search results.</p> <p>\"We continue to work co-operatively with the Commission,\" said Google spokesman Al Verney.</p> <p>\u2022 Almunia, who is investigating several patent disputes involving Google's Motorola Mobility (MMI), the world's biggest mobile phone maker Samsung and the world's second-biggest telecoms equipment maker Huawei, has urged the industry to resolve patent spats by itself rather than involve regulators where possible.</p> <p>\"I expect the leading companies in the sector not to misuse their intellectual property rights,\" he said. \"It is high time they look for negotiated solutions \u2013 I am tempted to call them peace talks \u2013 that would put an end to the patent wars.\"</p> <p>He emphasised that there was a growing consensus on both sides of the Atlantic on the damage that the misuse of standard-essential patents (SEPs) could do to competition\".</p> <p>Both Samsung and MMI are being investigated for using SEPs \u2013 which are meant to be licensed without prejudice to all comers \u2013 as weapons in patent battles which involve Apple and Microsoft.</p>",
  "<h2>What we wanted to do and why </h2> <p>A new initiative launched this week between the <a href=\"http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Canal &amp; River Trust </a>and<a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com/?utm_source=PPC_BR_Core_EX_5&amp;gclid=CJjb26DtvLICFYKMfAod13oAgQ\" title=\"\"> JustGiving</a> aims to give supporters more choice and control over how the money they raise is spent. For the first time, people can choose to fundraise for specific canal-related projects, knowing that 100% of their money will go directly to that appeal. Anyone visiting the trust's website can now select from 50 local projects they would like their JustGiving contributions to support.</p> <p>Research shows that people who support the trust have an affinity with a particular stretch of waterway \u2013 the 200 metres they walk their dog each morning or the five miles they run on a Sunday. Fundraisers who use the <a href=\"http://www.canaljunction.com/canal/kennet_avon.htm\" title=\"\">Kennet &amp; Avon Canal </a>want their money spent on improving the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal. Boaters in Birmingham will overwhelmingly want their money spent on their city's canals, rather than London's or Manchester's. And so on.</p> <p>I Donors decide on their preferred project, fundraise and can then monitor the impact their money is having. This will benefit us as a charity; with people confident about how we are using their money, we hope to see a larger increase in the number of people fundraising for us. We also know that donations are being directed on the projects that people care about.</p> <h2>What this kind of approach means for charities </h2> <p>In recent years, the charity sector has made great strides in being more accountable to donors. But being told what your fundraising is being spent on is just a start. Having the control and choice over where it is spent before you begin to fundraise is a different ball game.</p> <p>Choice and control are second nature across our lives. They're everywhere \u2013 from red-button choices on TV to self-booked holidays replacing packaged alternatives. Fundraisers should expect similar options when donating to their favourite charity.</p> <h2>How digital technology enabled us to do this</h2> <p>For charities to succeed in an increasingly competitive environment, it's vital that they use all the technology at their fingertips to give their donors a smooth user journey. Today's digital natives expect a simple and secure online donation process as standard. They aren't going to wait for a six-monthly newsletter to tell them how much was raised. So running these appeals entirely online ensures that there is a sense of momentum for people to get on board.</p> <p>It is also quick and easy to gain support \u2013 no ring-arounds chasing family and friends for the cash they pledged a few months before. It is easy to monitor, with online metrics enabling people to see the impact of their contribution to a particular project.</p> <h2>Will giving more control to supporters mean only the most popular and visible projects are boosted?</h2> <p>The answer is that it shouldn't. Charities remain responsible for setting the right balance. In the trust's case, the 50 projects have been selected to sit alongside our ongoing improvement and maintenance work. So even if donors favour some projects over others, as an organisation we are still ensuring the areas most in need are supported.</p> <p>We hope this initiative is the starting point for a new type of relationship with our supporters. As a new charity launching into a very crowded market, with so many good causes already competing for our shrinking wallets, we know that we need to engage effectively. We need to provide new ways for people to support us, and have those choices better reflect individuals' interests in our work. Only by doing so are we going to earn their support, raise income and, in the longer-term for the Canal &amp; River Trust, help people recognise our inland waterways as the national treasure they are.</p> <p><em>Ruth Ruderham is head of fundraising at the Canal &amp; River Trust</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown showed why the US Senate race in Massachusetts is one of the most closely watched in the nation, as the two candidates skilfully sparred and jabbed throughout their <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/09/20/scott-brown-elizabeth-warren-use-face-face-debate-amplify-themes-from-senate-trail/xbHOMMgcjrxdkQFYkM3r0J/story.html\">first debate</a> in what was a toe-to-toe contest.</p> <p>Both candidates displayed considerable ability as debaters, although Brown, the Republican incumbent, was willing to mix charm with mud-slinging, quickly ridiculing Warren's disputed claims to Native American heritage: \"Professor Warren claimed that she was a Native American, a person of colour and as you can see, she's not.\"</p> <p>Brown's remark was a reference to a controversy over Warren having represented her heritage without evidence, which Warren blames on \"family stories\" and denies any professional gain.</p> <p>Warren remained unflappable in the face of Brown's provocations, and at each point in the fast-moving debate hammered away at Brown's voting record in the US Senate, nailing him to extreme Republican positions on the economy, energy, climate change and women's rights. \"Senator Brown can say all he wants. But he has voted,\" Warren said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Brown strained to paint Warren as \"obsessed\" with raising taxes while trying to show her career in an unflattering light.</p> <p>On women's issues, Warren pointed to evidence of Brown's voting record as exposing the gap between his words and deeds. But Brown defended himself by saying: \"I've been fighting for women's rights when I was six years old when my mother was being abused by one of my stepfathers.\"</p> <p>Choosing to address his opponent as \"Professor Warren\" throughout, Brown's most outrageous remark came towards the end of the debate, when the candidates were asked about graduate unemployment. Brown launched into a rehearsed reply about the high cost of university tuition, which he turned into a reference to Warren's $300,000 salary from Harvard \u2013 suggesting that Warren's own pay was the cause of the rising cost of college tuition.</p> <p>Throughout the debate Brown bristled aggressively while managing to maintain an air of good humour and faint praise, while carefully blending in his support for positions popular in Massachusetts that are opposed by the Republican party nationally, such as abortion.</p> <p>Brown was eager to damage Warren's resum\u00e9, expansively attacking her for her part in asbestos claims settlements that Warren derided as wrong. When Warren voiced support for her former Harvard colleague Elena Kagan as US supreme court justice, and noted that Brown opposed her nomination, Brown sniped: \"I'm sorry I didn't vote for your boss.\"</p> <p>Warren's response was to yoke Brown to the Republican party of Mitt Romney and climate change deniers such as Senator James Inhofe, pointing out that GOP control of the Senate would put Inhofe at the head of the Senate's environmental committee. \"You're not running against James Inhofe, you're running against me, professor\" was Brown's riposte.</p> <p>Neither side could credibly claim victory from the debate. Brown launched a few skyrockets and displayed his everyman image, even mentioning the pickup truck he drove to the debate. Warren, less well-known than the incumbent, gained visibility and showed she had nothing to fear from Brown's attacks. If anything, her earnest demeanour contradicted Brown's efforts to label her a \"radical\", as he did seven times in the hour.</p> <p>The pair have three more debates still to come, and on the evidence of this they should be just as entertaining.</p>",
  "<p>When a team of scientists decided to work out the complex mathematics that control the shape and movement of a human ponytail, they had not set their sights on fame or glory. On Thursday, however, the British-American team behind the work were celebrated as this year's laureates for the Ig Nobel prize in physics.</p> <p>They were honoured alongside authors of research into why you spill coffee when walking around with a cup, how brain scans can detect brain activity anywhere (even in dead fish) if you use the right statistical tricks, and why leaning to the left makes the Eiffel Tower seem smaller.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.improbable.com/ig/2012/\" title=\"\">22nd Ig Nobel awards</a>, organised by the humour magazine <a href=\"http://www.improbable.com/\" title=\"\">Annals of Improbable Research</a> and awarded on Thursday at Harvard University, are a spoof of the Nobel prizes, to be announced next month. They honour achievements that \"first make people laugh, and then make them think\".</p> <p>Raymond Goldstein, a physicist at the University of Cambridge, was set the challenge of considering the physics of ponytails by the company Unilever.</p> <p>After developing a 3D imaging system to observe the properties of individual hairs \u2013 such as their curliness and stiffness \u2013 Goldstein's team was able to work out a mathematical equation that described the collective properties of a bundle.</p> <p>\"We found that the bundle of hair collectively behaved like a simple spring, where the force necessary to compress it was proportional to the extent to which you compressed it. That simple law is one of the things that would apply to a large number of systems.\"</p> <p>The mathematics might be interesting, said Goldstein, for people who want to make better loft insulation. \"You'd like to understand, if I manufacture this out of microscopic fibres with a particular elasticity and waviness, then what are the properties of the macroscopic bunch? How much will they settle under gravity over time?\"</p> <p>Craig Bennett, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was awarded this year's neuroscience prize with colleagues who decided to test out magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners on dead fish.</p> <p>Bennett and Abigail Baird, of Vassar College, had previously scanned a pumpkin and a Cornish game hen in a brain scanner so an Atlantic salmon seemed a reasonable next step. They used standard scanning techniques to build up a picture of the dead salmon's brain and were surprised to find a signal.</p> <p>Bennett said their study was a warning to neuroscientists to be careful with the way they do their work, so that they are not caught out by chance signals when they repeat a scan multiple times.</p> <p>\"If you have a 1% chance of hitting a bullseye when playing darts and you throw one dart, then you have a 1% chance of hitting the target. If you have 30,000 darts then, well, let's just say that you are probably going to hit the target a few times. The same is true in neuroimaging.</p> <p>\"The more chances you have to find a result, the more likely you are to find one, even by chance. We, as a scientific field, have accepted statistical methods to correct for this, but not all scientists use these methods in their neuroimaging analysis.\"</p> <p>Anita Eerland, of the Open University in the Netherlands, won this year's Ig Nobel for psychology when she and her team discovered they could make people guess the height of the Eiffel Tower incorrectly when they were leaning one way or another.</p> <p>Psychologists think people have a mental number line, where they tend to represent small numbers on the left and larger numbers on the right.</p> <p>This can be activated in a number of ways, such as looking to the right or left, and thinking about the line can prime people to think of higher or lower numbers.</p> <p>In her work Eerland found that the number line could be activated in volunteers who stood on tilted platforms. The volunteers thought they were standing upright but consistently guessed smaller numbers for the height of the Eiffel Tower when they were tilted to the left.</p> <p>For Rouslan Krechetnikov, of the University of California, Santa Barbara \u2013 the fluid dynamics Ig Nobel prize winner \u2013 inspiration struck at a scientific conference while watching delegates walking carefully with full mugs of hot drinks.</p> <p>His observational and theoretical analysis of the way coffee moved in cups led him to discover that it was just a coincidence that \"the sizes of common coffee cups (dictated by the convenience of carrying them and the normal consumption of coffee by humans) are such that the frequency of natural liquid oscillations in the cup is on the order of the step frequency of normal walking\".</p> <p>He noted: \"This fact together with the natural irregularity of biomechanics of walking, which contributes to the amplification of coffee sloshing, are responsible for coffee spilling.\"</p> <p>He had no idea, of course, of the attention his work would get. \"Personally, this goes along with my view of science \u2013 there should be a fun side to it. The project was certainly fun,\" he said. \"There are many people who are curious not only about black holes but also about everyday ordinary phenomena.\"</p> <p>Bennett said that, though his work on Atlantic salmon was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, it had had a wider use. \"In the year before our work was released, around 30% of fMRI papers did not use proper statistical correction methods in their analysis. Now, that number is less than 10%, and we feel that the salmon paper played a small but significant role in making that happen.\"</p> <p>This year's Ig Nobels were handed out by five Nobel laureates including the 2009 physics laureate Roy Glauber, 2009 physiology or medicine winner Jack Szostak, and 2007 economics winner Eric Maskin.</p> <p>Marc Abrahams, editor of the Annals of Improbable Research, and founder of the Ig Nobels, ended the ceremony with the traditional goodbye: \"If you didn't win an Ig Nobel prize tonight \u2013 and especially if you did \u2013 better luck next year.\"</p> <h2>Ig Nobel winners 2012 </h2> <p><strong>Psychology prize:</strong> <a href=\"http://ou-nl.academia.edu/AnitaEerland\" title=\"\">Anita Eerland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.brain-cognition.eu/index.html?personal.php?id=Zwaan\" title=\"\">Rolf Zwaan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mpi.nl/people/guadalupe-tulio\" title=\"\">Tulio Guadalupe,</a> for their study entitiled <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/11/23/0956797611420731.abstract\" title=\"\">Leaning to the Left Makes the Eiffel Tower Seem Smaller</a>.</p> <p><strong>Peace prize:</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.skn-nd.ru/products_en.html\" title=\"\">SKN company</a>, for using technology to <a href=\"http://www.skn-nd.ru/history_en.html\" title=\"\">convert old Russian ammunition into new diamonds</a>.</p> <p><strong>Acoustics prize:</strong> <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/qurihara/top-english\" title=\"\">Kazutaka Kurihara</a> and <a href=\"http://mobiquitous.com/\" title=\"\">Koji Tsukada</a> for creating the SpeechJammer, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6106\" title=\"\">a machine that disrupts a person's speech</a> by making them hear their own spoken words at a very slight delay.</p> <p><strong>Neuroscience prize:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/visit-researchers/bennett/index.php\" title=\"\">Craig Bennett</a>, <a href=\"http://psychology.vassar.edu/bios/abbaird.html\" title=\"\">Abigail Baird</a>, <a href=\"http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/miller/index.php\" title=\"\">Michael Miller</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~psych/people/faculty/wolford.html\" title=\"\">George Wolford</a>, for demonstrating that brain researchers, by using complicated instruments and simple statistics, can see <a href=\"http://prefrontal.org/files/posters/Bennett-Salmon-2009.pdf\" title=\"\">meaningful brain activity anywhere \u2013 even in a dead salmon</a>.</p> <p><strong>Chemistry prize:</strong> Johan Pettersson for <a href=\"http://www.skanskan.se/article/20111216/TRELLEBORGVELLINGE/712169821/1014/-/mysteriet-med-det-grona-vattnet-lost\" title=\"\">solving the puzzle</a> of why, in certain houses in the town of Andersl\u00f6v, Sweden, <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.se/37994/20111217/\" title=\"\">people's hair turned green</a>.</p> <p><strong>Literature prize:</strong> The US government general accountability office, for <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-480R\" title=\"\">issuing a report about reports about reports</a> that recommends the preparation of a report about the report about reports about reports.</p> <p><strong>Physics prize:</strong> <a href=\"http://math.stanford.edu/~keller/\" title=\"\">Joseph Keller</a>, <a href=\"http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold\" title=\"\">Raymond Goldstein</a>, <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/patrickbwarren\" title=\"\">Patrick Warren</a> and <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/rball/\" title=\"\">Robin Ball</a>, for calculating the <a href=\"http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/090760477\" title=\"\">balance of forces that shape and move</a> the hair <a href=\"http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/090760477\" title=\"\">in a human ponytail</a>.</p> <p><strong>Fluid dynamics prize:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.engineering.ucsb.edu/~rkrechet-lab/files/people/PI/index.html\" title=\"\">Rouslan Krechetnikov</a> and Hans Mayer, for studying the dynamics of liquid sloshing, to learn <a href=\"http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v85/i4/e046117\" title=\"\">what happens when a person walks while carrying a cup of coffee</a>.</p> <p><strong>Anatomy prize:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/dewaal.html\" title=\"\">Frans de Waal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/pokorny.html\" title=\"\">Jennifer Pokorny,</a> for discovering that chimpanzees <a href=\"http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/pdf_attachments/FacesBehinds2008.pdf\" title=\"\">can identify specific other chimpanzees</a> from seeing photographs of their rear ends.</p> <p><strong>Medicine prize:</strong> Emmanuel Ben-Soussan, for advising doctors who perform colonoscopies <a href=\"http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/13/5295.pdf\" title=\"\">how to minimise the chance of their patients exploding</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservative party treasurer is calling for a major change in tax laws so that Britain can compete with offshore havens.</p> <p>Lord Fink, the Tory donor and hedge fund chief, disclosed in an interview that he had lobbied George Osborne for a cut in taxes on invisible earnings so that he and other hedge funders no longer feel obliged to set up companies in places such as the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>His comments came as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/14/peers-mps-directors-companies-linked-tax-havens\" title=\"\">Guardian investigation reveals that 68 MPs and peers, who can influence Britain's tax laws, are either directors or non-executive directors of firms linked to tax havens.</a></p> <p>The findings show how widespread the use of offshore jurisdictions has become in British business life \u2013 even by companies which have lawmakers and major public figures on their boards.</p> <p>Politicians and companies have claimed that many of the offshore firms are established in these jurisdictions for operational business functions or administrative reasons rather than to secure a lower tax liability.</p> <p>Fink, who is a director of three firms which have subsidiaries or a parent company in the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and Guernsey, said: \"I don't see why the UK should not compete for jobs that at present are going to the Cayman Islands. I lobbied George Osborne when the Tories were in opposition. I have long felt that the British government loses jobs to tax havens by allowing the Revenue to have these rather archaic rules.\"</p> <p>The new business minister, Michael Fallon, the former trade secretary Peter Lilley and the backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg are among six Tory MPs who are listed as officers of firms established in, or linked to, jurisdictions known for opaque practices and low tax.</p> <p>Sixty-two peers including the Tory peer and composer Lord Lloyd-Webber, the former Lib Dem business spokesman Lord Razzall and Labour's Lord Carter of Coles are also involved with businesses that have offshore connections. Lloyd-Webber's company said its offshore subsidiary was dormant. Razzall said his company, which offers services including tax mitigation to clients, had not indulged in aggressive avoidance. Lord Carter has not responded.</p> <p>Of the 68 parliamentarians who have links to offshore havens, 27 are Tories, 17 are Labour peers, three are Lib Dem peers and another 21 are either crossbench or non-affiliated peers.</p> <p>The Guardian examined the registers of MPs' and lords' interests to identify companies where they are registered as directors or non-executive directors. This information was cross-referenced with accounts or other financial records to find out if the companies were registered or had a parent company or subsidiary in a tax haven.</p> <p>Revenue &amp; Customs does not provide a list of tax havens. The Guardian has drawn upon a list of <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr1265/text\" title=\"\">35 jurisdictions identified for their secrecy and low tax</a> compiled for the US Congress in 2009.</p> <p>The findings follow a national debate over the use of tax loopholes, prompted by claims from Osborne and David Cameron that they will clamp down on loopholes that allow \"morally repugnant\", albeit legal, aggressive tax avoidance. Anger at tax avoidance was heightened after revelations about the tax affairs of celebrities including the comedian Jimmy Carr.</p> <p>Legal tax avoidance represents nearly 14% of the UK tax gap, according to the Treasury. Research commissioned by the campaign group Tax Justice Network has found that at least \u00a313tn of wealth has been hidden offshore.</p> <p>Of the parliamentarians identified, most claimed the offshore firms were not being used for tax or corporate purposes. Many of the politicians and companies also said they made large tax contributions in the UK.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, which is conducting an inquiry into tax loopholes, said the findings were worrying because of the lack of transparency in offshore havens.</p> <p>\"As MPs, these individuals should be voting for proper transparency so we can see that these companies pay proper tax in the UK. The number of peers involved is bad enough. But to find that Tory MPs are setting themselves up as non-executives on companies that are connected to these places where there is such a lack of scrutiny and probity is just reprehensible and beyond belief,\" she said.</p> <p>Fallon was until two weeks ago a non-executive director of Tullett Prebon, the international money brokers. He stepped down when he took his post in the reshuffle. In 2008, he criticised Gordon Brown over the nationalisation of Northern Rock after it emerged the bank had a subsidiary in a tax haven. Under Fallon's directorship, for which he was paid \u00a351,000 a year when he left, Tullett also had an offshore operation in Guernsey. Tullett is registered in England, but it owns subsidiaries in secretive, low-tax jurisdictions including the Channel Islands, Switzerland and, until last year, Bermuda. He stood down as chairman of Tullett's remuneration committee in 2009 after an outcry over the company's decision to offer help to move staff to countries with more favourable tax regimes after the announcement of a tax on City bonuses.</p> <p>Fallon said none of Tullett's subsidiaries in Guernsey, Jersey and Switzerland were set up for tax reduction purposes and that the Guernsey and Jersey companies were resident for UK tax. The company said its Swiss arm was serving customers there and that Tullett had achieved HMRC's \"low risk\" status.</p> <p>Rees-Mogg declares his directorship of three separate companies related to Somerset Capital Management LLP on parliament's register of financial interests. However, he says he is not required to declare Somerset Capital Management (Cayman) Ltd (SCMC), which he also controls with two other directors, because it has no turnover or profit and the UK company receives all its revenue. \"I do not believe people have any obligation to pay more tax than the law requires but SCMC has no tax benefit to me, Somerset Capital Management or to our clients,\" he said.</p> <p>Tony Baldry, the Conservative MP for North Oxfordshire, was awarded a knighthood in the Queen's birthday honours. On a \u00a364,000 salary, he acts as an independent non-executive director at Woburn Energy whose parent company is registered in the British Virgin Islands tax haven. He said the company was independent from its parent, Cetus, and the offshore links were \"entirely as a consequence of the ownership structure of Cetus prior to its investment in Woburn\".</p> <p>Peter Lilley was recently appointed non-executive chairman of Tethys Petroleum, which has interests in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The company is registered in the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>He said: \"Tethys would not have a UK tax liability if it migrated to the UK since, as an exploration company, it reinvests its revenues in exploration, which extinguishes any tax liability under UK tax law. It of course pays taxes, royalties and production share to local governments in countries where it operates.\"</p> <p>The Tory former defence minister Nicholas Soames is chairman of private security contractor Aegis, owned by a Swiss holding company and with subsidiaries in the British Virgin Islands. Soames said: \"All trading profits of the group are either paid to or taxed as part of Aegis Defence Services Ltd's own activities and that company is fully taxable in the UK.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Evans, MP for Cardiff North, is non-executive chairman of Phoenix Life Ltd. Accounts from Companies House show Phoenix's parent company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and resident in Jersey. Evans did not respond to questions about the company.</p> <p><em>Comments will be turned on at 8am on 21 September 2012</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 September 2012 because the original said Michael Fallon moved from chairman to non-executive director of Tullett Prebon in 2009. Fallon has never been the company's chairman; the post he stood down from in 2009 was the chairmanship of its remuneration committee.</p>"
