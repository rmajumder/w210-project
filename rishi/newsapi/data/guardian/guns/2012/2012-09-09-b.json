[
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Welcome back, football</strong> After the appetiser that was the Dallas Cowboys' Wednesday night win in New York, the main course has finally arrived. So far it's been delicious. </p> <p>Already this afternoon we've seen <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap1000000060052/WK-1-Robert-Griffin-III-highlights\">Robert Griffin III make a sensational debut</a>, opening his account with an 88-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garcon and outperforming Drew Brees to put the Washington Redskins \u2013 at time of writing \u2013 on course for an incredible upset of the New Orleans Saints. Mark Sanchez and the New York Jets, meanwhile, have been making a statement of their own in dominating the much fancied Buffalo Bills.</p> <p>Now we move on to a match-up NFL fans have been waiting for ever since January. Green Bay and San Francisco were supposed to meet in the NFC Championship game eight months ago \u2013 the best two teams in the conference during the regular season. Instead the New York Giants awoke from a season-long slumber to knock off both teams in their own back yards before defeating New England at Super Bowl XLVI.</p> <p>If the stage here is not quite so grand, it will nevertheless be fascinating to see how each team begins the new season. Can Randy Moss, among the most athletically gifted wide receivers ever to play the game but coming off a one-year retirement, elevate a San Francisco offence whose main task last year was simply not to lose games that the defence could win on their own? Will an influx of youth provide a much-needed shot in the arm for Green Bay's defensive line?</p> <p>But just as was the case in January, the greatest intrigue will surround the match-up between one of the league's greatest offences and a similarly dominant D. Can San Francisco ends Justin and Aldon Smith bully Green Bay's offensive line as they have so many others? Will Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers find places to go that others couldn't against a defence that gave up just 14.3 points per game last year? It should be fun finding out.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Daring to dream</strong> Such is the parity that exists in the NFL that all fans should feel entitled to dream at this time of year. Every season, without fail, we see teams who massively surpass expectations and others who fail to live up to them. With that in mind I ask the fans out there, what would be your most optimistic prediction for your team in the season ahead? And what about your realistic one?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Meant to say in that last entry:</strong> You can email your predictions to me at <a href=\"mailto:pbliveblog@gmail.com\">pbliveblog@gmail.com</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.twitter.com/Paolo_Bandini\">tweet them over to @Paolo_Bandini</a>.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Update from the early games</strong> </p> <p>All of the following scorelines are now confirmed as final:<br>St Louis Rams 23 Detroit Lions 27<br>Miami Dolphins 10 Houston Texans 30<br>Atlanta Falcons 40 Kansas City Chiefs 24<br>Jacksonville Jaguars 23 Minnesota Vikings 26 (after OT)<br>New England Patriots 34 Tennessee Titans 13</p> <p>Still playing, meanwhile, are:<br>Indianapolis Colts 21 Chicago Bears 41<br>Philadelphia Eagles 10 Cleveland Browns 16<br>Washington Redskins 33 New Orleans Saints 25<br>Buffalo Bills 28 New York Jets 47</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Oh dear</strong> That was an inauspicious start. I'm afraid tech issues locked me out of the system there for a few minutes just at the point where the game was kicking off. Anyway, back now and the good news is that you haven't missed any scoring.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>49ers 0 Packers 0, 10:41 remaining in 1st quarter</strong> So here's where we're up to: Packers on offence after the Niners opened with a three-and-out. First and 10 at the San Francisco 42.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>49ers 0 Packers 0, 9:11 remaining in 1st quarter</strong> The Packers' drive comes to an end with Aaron Rodgers getting clobbered by his nearly namesake Carlos Rogers at the halfway line - Green Bay leaving the defensive back unblocked on what was supposed to be a quick release play on third and 11. Kyle Williams steps up to allow the punt to go out for a touchback. Meantime, the season predictions are flooding in. 49ers fan @PRDH tweets: \"Optimistic Superbowl win, realistic Championship game.\" That's a pretty high low bar you just set ...</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>49ers 0 Packers 0, 6:00 remaining in 1st quarter</strong> San Francisco are moving now and guess who that is streaking down the left sideline for a 20-yard grab to the Packers' 28-yard line. Randy Moss didn't have to do anything special to reel that one in, but I am fascinated to see how he goes this year. There might never have been a player with quite the same combination of size, speed and body control as Moss had in his younger years.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Field goal! 49ers 3 Packers 0, 4:53 remaining in 1st quarter</strong> The drive concludes with the Niners getting themselves on the board, courtesy of a 40-yard David Akers field goal. Charles Woodson had jarred the ball loose from Mario Manningham's hands on the play after the Moss reception, but it bobbled out of bounds. San Francisco did not manage another first down from there.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>49ers 3 Packers 0, 4:53 remaining in 1st quarter</strong> The kick-off goes for another touchback. Meantime, Darren Brimer is still fuming about an incident during our tech freeze, when Aldon Smith was penalised for taking his helmet off following a sack of Rogers. \"That's it. I haven't got a mortgage, but I'm going to take one out and put it on the Packers coming out on top this season,\" he thunders by email. \"They really are the luckiest team. Fifteen yards for taking your helmet off, which was half off anyway 'cause Rodgers kicked it. And now a wasted challenge by SF, which they WILL wish hadn't used later in the half.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>49ers 3 Packers 0, 2:57 remaining in 1st quarter</strong> Green Bay waste no time getting back up to midfield, Rodgers completing three quick passes in succession out of the no huddle before rolling out on a bootleg and running out of bounds for a first down at the 47. \"Oakland Raiders fan here,\" tweets @nomisknarf. \"Optimistic: 3rd place in the AFC West. Pessimistic: 4th place in the AFC West.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>49ers 3 Packers 0, 1:57 remaining in 1st quarter</strong> Wow - what a play that was by Tarell Brown, the 49ers DB launching himself with immaculate timing to stretch out a hand and bat away a Rodgers bomb that seemed sure to finish up in the hands of James Jones just a few yards outside the endzone on the left. The ball was slightly underthrown and Jones was falling, so it likely wouldn't have gone for a score but Green Bay certainly wouldn't have been far out. Instead, two plays later, they send out Masthay to punt from the San Francisco 45. Kyle Williams makes the fair catch at the eight.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>End of 1st quarter: 49ers 3 Packers 0</strong> Early days it may be, but so far defence&gt;offence. Meantime, @crashdavis2008 raises the pessimistic predictions bar further on Twitter: \"Vikings fan here - Optimism: 4th place in the NFC North. Realism: 4th place in the NFC North.\" And they won today, too.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>49ers 3 Packers 0, 14:12 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Green Bay's turn to get angry with these replacement officials, as Clay Matthews is handed a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty. The official position would be that he left his feet after Smith had made his throw. \"McCarthy is pissed,\" tweets @PackerReport. \"Not mad. pissed\". First and 10 for San Francisco at their own 40.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 10 Packers 0, 11:10 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> It had to be, didn't it? Randy Moss comes up with his first touchdown reception as a 49er less than four minutes into the second quarter of his first game for the team. A simple case of blown coverage in the Green Bay secondary, the receiver left to take up position unchecked right in the middle of the endzone. Smith had no trouble delivering the ball right to him.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>49ers 10 Packers 0, 11:10 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Another touchback from the kick-off. \"Browns fan here. My optimistic prediction is 4th place in the AFC North,\" writes Mark Elliott by email. \"Pessimistic: in a surprise move relegation from NFL introduced, Browns play in Lingerie League next season.\" In fairness, it would probably make for a more entertaining spectacle in Cleveland.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>49ers 10 Packers 0, 10:34 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> A statement throw from Rodgers to start the drive, looking Jordy Nelson's way for the first time all game and connecting with him on a 28-yard strike. Packers straight up to their own 48.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>49ers 10 Packers 0, 9:02 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Rodgers takes a shot after San Francisco jump offside on first down at the Niners' 38-yard line, but misses on the long bomb to James Jones. First and five at the 33 now.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>49ers 10 Packers 0, 7:33 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> What looks like a big-time catch from James Jones running a fade down the right sideline is wiped off by an offensive pass interference penalty. Perfect call by the officials, too, Jones giving Culliver a very visible shove just as the ball was about to arrive. The fans at Lambeau Field disagree.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>49ers 10 Packers 0, 5:21 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> In spite of the penalty, the Packers keep rolling - Rodgers hitting Jermichael Finley for a fresh set of downs on third and 12, then two plays later flipping a short pass to Randall Cobb, who turns it up-field for another 12 yards down to the San Francisco nine. \"For my Browns, the Number 1 pick next year,\" tweets @CiaranMcMonagle, wading into the predictions conversation. \"Optimistic and realistic.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>49ers 10 Packers 0, 4:47 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Very naughty from Perrish Cox, who treads on the ankle of Finley as the tight end lies in the endzone at the conclusion of a play. A brief kerfuffle ensues, but the more important news is that a pass interference call on the play will give Green Bay a fresh set of downs on the one.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 10 Packers 7, 4:40 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Revenge for Finley, who has the ball delivered to him in the endzone by Rodgers on a short buttonhook. Somewhere in amongst the five penalties on that drive, Green Bay actually seem to have got into a groove. Rodgers so far is 14 of 17 for 124 yards. San Francisco need to generate more pressure up front.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>49ers 10 Packers 7, 4:40 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> We're four for four on kick-offs going for touchbacks so far. \"Not fuming at all,\" writes Darren Brimer in response to my comments on his earlier email. \"Packers fan here. Just recognise that the Pack can occasionally get 'home' decisions, even on the road, with the same regularity as, say, a restart is awarded to a GB Olympic rower or cyclist.\" Naughty.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>49ers 10 Packers 7, 3:41 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> I've noted Rodgers's numbers, so here's a nod to Smith too. Another completion to Moss at the San Francisco 42 means he's now 10 of 11 for 112 yards and, of course, that TD. Could Moss be the man to finally help Smith start to become the player San Francisco had in mind when they took him with the first overall pick in 2005? Or is this Green Bay secondary just rather bad. Hmm.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Two minute warning: 49ers 10 Packers 7</strong> We reach the TV time-out with San Francisco driving, looking at a second and seven on the Green Bay 45 when we return. In the meantime, if you'd like to see Randy Moss's first touchdown catch as a 49er, <a href=\"http://t.co/N9wCYgpG\">now you can</a>.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>49ers 10 Packers 7, 1:05 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> San Francisco use their second time-out as they contemplate third and one at the Green Bay 25. \"What you think of all the bad calls/flags so far in the 49ers game?\" asks @AbdallaTaryam on Twitter. Rather than answer that question myself, I may as well hand you over to the league's former vice-president of officiating, and present Fox Sports analyst Mike Pereira (@MikePereira). \"Here's what I think of the officiating in Green Bay/San Francisco for first half,\" he tweets. \"Not too strong... at this point.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Field goal! 49ers 13 Packers 7, 0:55 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> San Francisco are unable to move the ball any further, but after another time-out David Akers belts a 43-yard kick through the posts. Time yet for Green Bay to respond?</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>49ers 13 Packers 7, 0:55 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Kick-off. Touchback. I can probably stop telling you about these, right?</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>49ers 13 Packers 7, 0:18 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> There's that pressure I was talking about! Green Bay go three and out with Rodgers twice feeling obliged to throw the ball away after being flushed out of the pocket. Masthay's huge punt is returned 20 yards by Williams to the San Francisco 38, and suddenly it's the 49ers looking to add to their score before the half.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>WHAT A KICK THAT IS! 49ers 16 Packers 7, 0:00 remaining in 2nd quarter</strong> Blimey. A 63-yard field goal (yup) from David Akers - tying the NFL record for the longest in league history - gives San Francisco a nine-point advantage going into the half. Colin Kaepernick had picked up 17 yards for the Niners on the first play of the new drive, but Smith threw incomplete on each of the next two plays, and with two seconds left on the clock Jim Harbaugh decided to let Akers have a shot at it. He got a perfect connection, but the ball still clanged off the crossbar before hopping over.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Half-time: 49ers 16 Packers 7</strong> To confirm, that's the half. A pretty darn one it was too for San Francisco - who went three and out to open the game but scored on every subsequent drive. The Packers have been undermined by penalties, but their failure to add more than seven points so far is also a reflection on a San Francisco defence which just does not give up points easily. We all know Green Bay can put up points in bunches, but this is not where they wanted to be at this stage of the game.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Kicking conundrum</strong> \"Which kick was the more impressive in your opinion, Akers 63-yard record equalling effort, or rookie Blair Walsh's 55-yarder to force overtime in Minnesota?\" asks Liam Offord by email. A good question - and both were certainly remarkable. Walsh's had an added element of pressure, with the game on the line, but 63 yards is 63 yards. There's a reason it's a record.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>49ers 16 Packers 7, 14:54 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Off we go again and - hey, look - a kick-off return! Cobb takes it out of his endzone all the way to the ... erm ... Green Bay 21. Oh well.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>49ers 16 Packers 7, 13:41 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Poor clock management obliges Green Bay to burn an early time-out as they prepare for a third-and-one at their 30-yard-line, Jordy Nelson having been pushed out of bounds there after a quick reception on the play before. Meanwhile, @crashdavis2008 notes that Akers was not the second ever to make a 63-yard field goal, as I mistakenly claimed before. \"3 x 63yd FGs in NFL history before today. Tom Dempsey, Jason Elam and Sebastian Janokowski,\" he tweets.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>49ers 16 Packers 7, 13:25 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Rodgers overthrows Nelson as he goes looking for a home run on third-and-one, and the Packers have to punt. Masthay does a good job with that, at least, booming it down to the San Francisco 16 with plenty of hang-time, leaving Williams to make the fair catch. \"Harbaugh knows how!\" writes an enthusiastic Timothy Talbot by email. \"How to motivate, how to delegate, how to un-complicate! He has instilled a culture of responsibility and achievement in the 9ers, who have very quickly become one of the most efficient, disciplined, and consistently excellent teams in the entire league. Some coaches come from the College ranks and have a rough go of it,but not Jimmy Harbaugh! In only his 2nd year, he already has established himself as one of the best Head Coaches in the league. Just a wonderful tactician and superlative motivator, also possesses a very keen eye for new talent, as well as getting the most out of what he's already got on hand. Could not be happier w/ what he's done with the long time sad sack 9ers, now the (once again) mighty 9ers!\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>49ers 16 Packers 7, 10:48 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> The 49ers are flying again here, requiring just three plays to cross halfway after Smith is sacked on the first play of the new series. After a short completion to Hunter, Smith hits Michael Crabtree for a 20-yard gain, then hands off to Frank Gore, who tears around the right side of the line for 21. Having previously questioned whether the Niners were generating enough push up front, I'd now have to turn that question to the Pack. Clay Matthews is getting no change out of left tackle Joe Staley, and nobody else seems to be picking up the slack.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Touchdown? 49ers 16 Packers 7, 9:17 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> The call on the field is a score for San Francisco, as Kendall Hunter bundles over the left-hand corner of the goal-line from nine yards out but this one is surely coming back. Replays suggest the running back had both stepped out of bounds at the two and then been down by contact before crossing into the endzone. We await the verdict from the replay booth.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Call overturned. 49ers 16 Packers 7, 9:17 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> The chief official rules that Hunter did indeed step out at the two. It will be second and goal from there for San Francisco.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 23 Packers 7, 8:15 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> This one will count, Smith zipping the ball into the hands of Vernon Davis from four yards out on third down after San Francisco had been pushed back by a false start. Davis, hilariously enough, attempts to spike the ball through the posts but fails to get enough clearance on his leap and winds up being rejected by the crossbar. The crowd jeer. This time, though, it may be that those who laugh last do not laugh loudest.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>49ers 23 Packers 7, 8:10 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Cobb takes the ball out of his endzone again from the kick-off, and this time gets out to the 28. \"As a 'Skins fan I'd have taken a 8-8 season this yr given past yrs rubbish,\" tweets @markc999, joining in our predictions thread. \"Now... RGIII's taking us to the Superbowl!!!\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>49ers 23 Packers 7, 4:20 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> The Packers just cannot get into a rhythm today - and though that is in great part a reflection on San Francisco's defensive performance, it is a straightforward mistake that kills this latest drive, with Finley dropping a ball he really should have caught just inside the 49ers half on third down. If San Francisco can score again on this next drive - and they have on the past five - it's going to be a long way back for Green Bay.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>49ers 23 Packers 7, 2:43 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> Oh dear. The crowd at Lambeau Field finally get something to cheer about as Smith is sacked by Woodson and Matthews to leave his team looking at second and 15 from their own 10-yard line, but on the very next play Frank Gore is allowed to turn the corner on the left and dash up the sideline for a 16-yard gain. Matthews had got great penetration once again, throwing Staley back into Gore's intended path, but despite taking such a detour he still found nobody waiting for him as he got to the outside.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>49ers 23 Packers 7, 0:46 remaining in 3rd quarter</strong> At last Green Bay get their stop, Michael Crabtree wrapped up two yards short of the marker on third and five. For the first time since the Niners' first possession, Andy Lee comes on to punt - booting the ball down to the Green Bay 19, where Cobb calls for a fair catch.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>End of third quarter: 49ers 23 Packers 7</strong> Rodgers finishes the half with completions to Cobb and James Jones, each good for a first down. His team will pick up at their own 48 when play resumes.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>49ers 23 Packers 7, 14:08 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Still nothing doing for Green Bay, Greg Jennings juggling and almost pulling in a low pass from Rodgers on third down before losing it just before Dashon Goldshon arrived with a brutal hit. Masthay's punt is fair caught at the 10 by Williams. Time is running out for last year's No1 seeds in the NFC.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>Touchdown? 49ers 23 Packers 7, 11:16 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Could this be the jump-start Green Bay needed? Randall Cobb returns Lee's punt 62 yards for a score after the Niners go three and out. Initially it appears as though the play will be wiped off by a penalty flag, but the block in the back call is overturned Now, though, the play is under review - with the head official set to check that Cobb didn't step out of bounds on his way to the endzone.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 23 Packers 15, 11:16 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> The ruling stands, and Green Bay cap it by making the two-point conversion. Suddenly, this is a one-score ballgame. While replays confirm that Cobb did not step out of bounds, the decision to wave off the flag was a questionable one. There were actually two incidents during the return that looked dubious, and Mike Pereira on Fox confirms that one of them - a block in the back by Terrell Manning - should have been penalised.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>49ers 23 Packers 15, 11:16 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Harbaugh is furious about the waving off of that flag, and with good reason - since it happened right in front of him. Throughout this game, these replacement officials have not covered themselves in glory. The kick-off goes for a touchback. \"This is a HELLA disheartening start to the Packers' season,\" tweets @maeve666 - possibly just before the Cobb touchdown. \"Are Rodgers' passes overthrown, or do his receivers underrun? Or maybe Rodgers and Cobb are going to wake up the Pack in the final quarter? Here's hoping.\" Rodgers has definitely overthrown a few today ... but Cobb has been everywhere.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>49ers 23 Packers 15, 8:59 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Harbaugh is getting no happier as he loses his second challenge of the game (the first was during our tech blackout), disputing the decision that Frank Gore was tackled short of the first-down marker on third and two from the 28. Lee's punt is downed by Cobb at the Green Bay 25.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Interception! 49ers 23 Packers 15, 8:50 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Oh. Just when it looked like the Packers were gaining some momentum, Rodgers throws his first interception of the season - firing the ball straight into the hands of Navarro Bowman, who he simply must not have seen. A terrible pass, and Bowman returns it to the Green Bay 23.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 30 Packers 15, 8:41 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> All too easy for Frank Gore, who sprints around the right end of the line and into the endzone on the first play of the new series. San Francisco restore a 15 point advantage, and frankly that's a fair reflection of the gap between these two teams today.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>49ers 30 Packers 15, 7:00 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Another penalty - this time for holding - threatens to derail Green Bay's latest drive, but at last Rodgers manages to make something happen deep - leading James Jones away down the right sideline. The receiver is eventually pushed out of bounds by Bowman - but only after a 49-yard gain. Just like that, the Packers are in the red zone.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 30 Packers 22, 6:03 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Where did that come from? Rodgers hits Jones again on each of the next two plays, picking up nine and then 10 yards en route to the endzone. The quarterback was five for five on that drive. We know he's more than capable of these sorts of drives, but we really hadn't seen any evidence of it tonight until now.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>49ers 30 Packers 22, 5:58 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Kendall Hunter takes it out of his endzone to the 49ers' 26.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>49ers 30 Packers 22, 3:45 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> The 49ers make quick progress to near midfield, Smith hitting Miller for a 15-yard gain up to their 46. But two plays later he is sacked for a big loss by Clay Matthews, and on third and long the quarterback opts to tuck the ball in and scramble for a short gain, rather than risk a shot downfield. Green Bay use up their last time-out to stop the clock.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>49ers 30 Packers 22, 3:37 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Cobb makes all of a yard back on the ensuing punt return, taking it out to the Green Bay 16. With no time-outs left, it's all or nothing time for the Packers.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>Two minute warning: 49ers 30 Packers 22</strong> A slow start to the drive as Rodgers throws incomplete on first down then finds himself scrambling for a single yard on second. But on third he gets the ball to Cobb over the middle and just past the first-down marker. And that takes us to the two minute warning.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Turnover on downs! 49ers 30 Packers 22, 0:49 remaining in 4th quarter</strong> Just as they have for most of the afternoon, San Francisco come up with the stop when they need it. Faced with fourth and 10 after one incompletion, a sack and then a quick hit over the middle to Cobb, Rodgers wound up for a big heave down the sideline to Nelson, but Culliver had perfect position on the receiver in man coverage and twisted in the air to knock the ball down. Alex Smith will kneel on the ball, and San Francisco are going to open the season with a win over the Packers at Lambeau Field.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>Final score: San Francisco 49ers 30 Green Bay Packers 22</strong> Well, well, well - a fantastic start to the season for San Francisco, defeating the team who posted the best record in the NFC last season on their own field. The Niners appear improved on offence - with Smith far more than just a game manager as he and Randy Moss attacked this Green Bay defence in the first half - and on defence as stout as ever. The Packers, though, will have much soul-searching to do after beginning this season as they finished the last: with a defeat at Lambeau. Anyway, that's all from me for now. Thanks for joining me and for all your tweets and emails. Do check back in tomorrow for our Five Things We Learned blog looking back at all the weekend's action.</p>",
  "<p>Many of Britain's gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools are \"no-go zones\" for disabled people and will struggle to cope with an expected surge in interest in fitness activities, following the Paralympic games, campaigners have warned.</p> <p>A crowdsourced survey of hundreds of gyms across the UK by charity volunteers suggests that many local facilities are partially inaccessible, difficult to navigate and expensive to join. Some did not have specialist gym equipment and nearly half lacked staff trained in disability awareness.</p> <p>One of the key legacy aims of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics-2012\" title=\"\">Paralympics</a> is to increase participation in sports by Britain's 11 million disabled people. Just 18% of disabled adults undertake physical activity for more than 30 minutes a week, compared with 38% of non-disabled adults,<a href=\"http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/our_news/%C2%A38_million_legacy_investment.aspx\" title=\"\"> according to Sport England</a>.</p> <p>The success of the Games has raised hopes of a surge in interest in disability sports participation, but the survey of gyms and leisure centres, carried out on behalf of the charity <a href=\"http://www.lcdisability.org/\" title=\"\">Leonard Cheshire Disability</a>, found that many facilities are unprepared to capitalise on the potential demand.</p> <p>The charity said: \"Gyms and leisure facilities are a crucial 'first point of entry' to sports and physical activity for most adults. Yet for many disabled people they are 'no-go zones'. Inaccessible changing rooms, steps, poor staff training and lack of usable sports equipment are some of the common barriers that can prevent disabled customers from getting involved.\"</p> <p>Guy Parckar, the charity's head of policy, said that while most gyms were \"broadly accessible\" and complied with disability discrimination laws to fit ramps and lifts, many had failed to get right small but crucial details. These could make all the difference when it came to attracting or retaining disabled customers.</p> <p>Although most gyms provided disabled parking spaces, for example, the survey found that some bays were not wide enough to enable a wheelchair to be unpacked from a car. Parckar said in many cases, improvements such as installing easy-to-read signs or colour contrast markings on steps, would be relatively inexpensive. It was crucial that gyms sought advice from local disabled people on how to improve access, he added.</p> <p>The survey of 300 UK leisure facilities found that:</p> <p>\u2022 Nearly a third of gyms did not have an automatic door at the entrance to the gym, while some were fitted with heavy internal doors that were difficult to open. One survey reporter said he watched a wheelchair user forced to open such a door by pushing it with his head.</p> <p>\u2022 Although many gyms had lifts, just over one in five were not working properly. A common problem was that lifts were too small for larger wheelchairs and control buttons were set too high. In one case, it was reported that a lift leading to the gym area of a leisure centre did not appear to have been working for more than a year.</p> <p>\u2022 A quarter of swimming pools did not have hoists to support disabled people to get into the water, while 31% of gyms did not have any fitness equipment that was suitable for disabled people.</p> <p>The survey, carried out as part of Leonard Cheshire Disability's <a href=\"http://www.actionforaccess.org/gyms\" title=\"\">Exercise Your Right</a> campaign, also highlighted instances where gyms provided excellent services to disabled people. Highly rated gyms were identified as such, not just because they had accessible buildings or equipment but because they practiced good \"customer care and management.\" They also employed staff who were trained to be aware of disabled people's needs.</p> <p>There is a potentially huge appetite for sport and exercise among disabled people, according to a separate survey of nearly 1,000 disabled people, carried out this week by Leonard Cheshire Disability. It found more than two thirds of respondents said they would like to take part in sport more regularly. Although a quarter said they exercised twice a week or more, a third of those surveyed said they never took part in sport or exercise.</p> <p>Some 85% of respondents were not members of gyms or leisure centres. Asked why they did not consider joining, more than half said it was too expensive, while 26% said difficulty in accessing facilities put them off</p> <p>Just under half of respondents said the Paralympics had inspired them to get more involved in sport or exercise, and 26% thought that the Games would encourage more disabled people to take part. But while 89% felt the Games would leave a \"positive legacy\" overall, just 12% believed it would lead to improved accessibility.</p> <p>David Stalker, chief executive of the Health and Fitness Industry Association, which represents more than 3,000 UK gyms and leisure centres, said it was concerned at the findings.</p> <p>Stalker said the association would be continuing its work with charities to get more disabled people active: \"We will continue to work with our operator members to go above and beyond the minimum requirements to deliver a user friendly environment for all their customers.\"</p>",
  "<p>A third of academy schools are selling junk food that is banned in maintained schools under regulations introduced to protect children's health, a series of freedom of information requests has revealed.</p> <p>Out of 108 academies that responded to the requests, 29 were selling chocolate and other confectionery, nine admitted selling fizzy drinks and seven sold energy drinks such as Red Bull.</p> <p>An investigation by Channel 4's <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-115/episode-2\" title=\"\">Dispatches</a> found that 37 out of the 108 academies that responded were selling at least one food or drink product that was not permitted before they became academies. Such schools are state-funded but independently run; more than half of secondaries in England are now academy schools, which can opt out of national standards for school meals.</p> <p>Dispatches also found from freedom of information requests to councils and academies that less than a quarter of children at the secondary schools that responded were having school dinners.</p> <p>There was wide variation on the money spent on dinners \u2013 from <a href=\"http://www.eastlothian.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">East Lothian council</a> which spent \u00a33.30 per meal on ingredients to Pembrokeshire, where the spend was just 53p.</p> <p>In a statement, <a href=\"http://www.pembrokeshire.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Pembrokeshire county council</a> said it provided \"fresh, high-quality school meals\", and had kept costs down by awarding the contract to a local supplier. A typical meal option is roast chicken with herb stuffing, potatoes, carrots and broccoli, or vegetable bolognese with garlic bread and peas, the council said. The Channel 4 programme also found that 14 schools had stopped providing a hot meal since 2007.</p> <p>In May, research by the <a href=\"http://www.schoolfoodtrust.org.uk/schools/reports/food-in-academy-schools\" title=\"\">School Food Trust</a> painted a mixed picture of academy food provision. Out of a sample of 100 academies, a quarter said they were selling crisps and savoury snacks, while more than half said they were selling cereal bars \u2013 these are banned from maintained schools because of their sugar content.</p> <p>The research found that some academies did well in providing food that met national standards, but at many others children were being offered a diet high in fat, sugar and salt</p> <p>Jamie Oliver, whose television <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/school-dinners\" title=\"\">series in 2005</a> first raised awareness of the lack of nutrition in school dinners, has warned that children's health will suffer because the standards that apply to maintained schools have been relaxed for academies and free schools.</p> <p>Oliver said earlier this year that the government's approach threatens a \"massive erosion of everything we have achieved\". <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=The%20Department%20for%20Education\" title=\"\">The Department for Education </a>described the Dispatches claims as \"shoddy and misleading\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"The last government never expected that local authorities would monitor schools' compliance with standards \u2013 so claiming that this government's education reforms have led to a weakening of the way those standards are applied is nonsense. Many academies are already using their freedom from council control to improve food.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was all about the new on Saturday, when Sale played their first Premiership fixture at the Salford City Stadium and gave a first start to Danny Cipriani. How poignant, then, that one of their favourite old boys should have returned on such an occasion to steal the show. Time has yet to dull Charlie Hodgson's edge. He collected 18 points in Saracens' 23-16 victory and generally upstaged the man who would replace him.</p> <p>\"He's slightly quicker than me, Cipriani,\" Hodgson said, with that shy smile of his, referring to a moment in the first half when Cipriani, having been charged down by Hodgson, turned and caught him to prevent a certain try. There is no doubt that the younger man is quicker of foot, and on this occasion enjoyed a better strike rate with his shots at goal, which is to say that he kicked four out of four in reply to six out of eight, but in every other department it was Hodgson's day.</p> <p>He will be 32 in November and his England days are over. The impression remains that his international career never hit the heights that it might have. He was handed the most unenviable of hospital passes in English rugby's history, by having to replace the man, Jonny Wilkinson, who had just won England's first World Cup before he went missing with injury. Twickenham Man never took to Hodgson but at Premiership level his achievements are unmatched. Last weekend he became the first man to pass 2,000 Premiership points. The next best, Andy Goode, is nearly 400 points behind.</p> <p>On Saturday, he orchestrated a classic Saracens victory: intense, focused and, when the moment came, deadly precise. \"I thought for the first 25, 30 minutes of the match we were massively in control,\" said Mark McCall, their director of rugby. \"We built a 12-3 lead. It could have been more.\"</p> <p>That said, it could have been less too. Hodgson's second penalty was a travesty perpetrated against Cipriani. A beautifully precise buildup worked Chris Ashton into Sale territory but his pass to Richard Wigglesworth, another former Sale man, was behind the man and into touch. The referee, Dave Pearson decided that Cipriani, who had lunged for the ball, had deliberately knocked it down. In truth, he was nowhere near it. Cipriani appealed to him to refer it upstairs, as, technically, the referee now can. But Pearson, as is his way, was sure of himself, and, anyway, is not allowed to act on the appeal of a player.</p> <p>So that penalty should never have stood and Sale were once again a little hard done by towards the end of the half, when they were in the ascendancy.</p> <p>Sam Tuitupou was taken out brazenly by Brad Barritt as he chased Cipriani's chip into the Saracens 22. That was referred upstairs and the foul play confirmed but Sale's reasonable appeals for a yellow card were dismissed. It is early days yet in the experiment to extend the powers of the television match official but it seems the greater his remit, the less he can keep everyone satisfied.</p> <p>Sale closed to within three points at the break and then scored a breakaway try through Will Addison at the start of the second half to open up a 16-12 lead but it was Saracens who dominated the rest of the match, culminating in a fine try by Ashton on the hour, worked into the corner masterfully by Hodgson and Alex Goode.</p> <p>At least a bonus point represents progress for Sale, after last week's 40-point defeat to Exeter. \"I thought we were a lot better than last week, which was the key thing,\" said Bryan Redpath, their director of rugby. \"But we lacked a little bit in confidence in certain parts because of last week's drubbing.\"</p> <p>Sale's players are better than this but it is a new adventure for them, which will surely improve. How they could do, though, with a man like Hodgson in the middle of it all.</p>",
  "<p>Favourable weather and good planning avoided major air pollution problems during the Olympics, prompting the University of Manchester to suggest that the London Games may have been the least polluted Olympics in recent times. Good news, but the Games were not pollution free.</p> <p>In the final four days of the Games, air began circulating over England and the near continent causing increases in ground level ozone. Increased air pollution presents a health risk to us all but it can be a much bigger problem for marathon runners due to sheer volumes of air that they breathe during the race. By scheduling the race in the morning the organisers avoided the afternoon peak in ground level ozone, and pollution was below the World Health Organisation's guidelines.</p> <p>The cycling road race passed through some of London's most polluted streets, including Putney High Street and roads around Knightsbridge; however, road closures during the events were very effective in reducing air pollution concentrations which remained low.</p> <p>On the last afternoon of the Games a huge fire broke out in Dagenham, east London, around 10km from the Olympic Park. Over 200 firefighters with 40 fire engines fought the blaze, London's biggest fire for several years, and brought it under control before the closing ceremony. Favourable weather meant that the smoke rapidly dispersed and did not cause any pollution problems.</p>",
  "<p>The queue to be the next Jason Robinson grows by the week. Nine days ago, after scoring twice and showing the trademark in-out style to defences in the season's opener at Twickenham, it was the Wasps wing Christian Wade who headed the list.</p> <p>Now Premiership coaches will be reaching for the tapes to analyse how Kyle Eastmond went round, through or under eight tackles to score Bath's third try to take Saturday's game at Bath away from Wasps.</p> <p>With 13 tries in his last 19 games, Wade may seem to outgun Eastmond and is already on England's radar. However, physically \u2013 at 5ft 7in and 12st 8lb \u2013 Eastmond is the better match for the man capped 51 times by England and who also spent some time on the Bath wing.</p> <p>However, Eastmond is no overnight success. He is 23 and, like Robinson, converted from rugby league, moving from St Helens last October for a first union season best forgotten. Injuries limited his appearances to two and both were from the replacements' bench. Saturday's try was his first in the league.</p> <p>Eastmond is said to have had an impressive pre-season, damaging the pride of at least one back-row forward who stood in his way. Brad Davis, the man who brought him to union, is convinced he has a future with England.</p> <p>\"We identified Kyle a couple of years ago with my league background and we got him to Bath,\" said Davis, formerly a coach with Castleford. \"He had an injury last season but he had a great pre-season.</p> <p>\"He's a smart player, we knew that when we signed him. His ability has never been in doubt and the try he scored was a contender for try of the season. Apart from that he has a lot about his game in terms of passing, kicking and running. He is one of the best at the club and we are very pleased with his development.\"</p> <p>Davis, who is all that remains of Sir Ian McGeechan's Bath coaching team, says Eastmond has responded well to the arrival of the former Springbok coach, Gary Gold. \"When the new coaching staff came in they encouraged him to play and there has never been a doubt in my mind about what he can do... if he can just keep developing and adding things to his game there is no doubt in my mind about what he can do for Bath and England in the future.\"</p> <p>Wade also scored and from 50 yards but not until seven minutes from time when Wasps were 14 points down. The 21-year-old was well marshalled for most of the afternoon and had his positional sense tested by an endless aerial bombardment from the fly-half Olly Barkley.</p> <p>A string of attacks down Wade's wing also brought an early try for Matt Banahan but the former England back ended the day with his knee in a brace and will have a scan on Sundaywas due to have a scan to learn the extent of the injury.</p> <p>As for Wasps, their coach Dai Young admitted to being second best except in broken play. They lacked patience, wasted too much ball and missed too many tackles. After two games they have just two bonus points to show for their promise.</p> <p><strong>Bath</strong> Abendanon (Cuthbert 72); Eastmond, Hipkiss, Banahan (Devoto 83), Biggs; Barkley, Claassens; Catt (James 52), Mears (Batty 70), Wilson (Palma-Newport 70), Hooper (capt Attwood 60), Day, Taylor, Fearns (Ovens 62), Skirving.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Banahan, Biggs, Eastmond. <strong>Cons</strong> Barkley 3 <strong>Pens</strong> Barkley 3.</p> <p><strong>Wasps</strong> Southwell (capt); Varndell, Daly, Bell (Mayor 22), Wade; Robinson, Simpson; Payne (McIntyre 70), Lindsay (Rhys Thomas 56), Staibano (Taulafo 70), Palmer (Launchbury 54), Wentzel, Haskell, Poff, Vunipola (Johnson 60).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Vardell, Wade. <strong>Cons</strong> Robinson 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Robinson 3.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> Tim Wigglesworth (RFU). <strong>Attendance</strong> 10,438</p>",
  "<p>Some commentators have taken to referring to this Wednesday as \"the day that could make or break the common currency\", and they're not far off the mark. On that day, Germany's constitutional court will announce its verdict on the legality of the European Stability Mechanism, the permanent rescue fund for struggling eurozone countries. If implemented, the ESM's share capital of \u20ac700bn would be provided by all 17 eurozone members in proportion to their economic size. Fourteen have so far ratified the treaty \u2013 Estonia, Italy and Germany are the only ones remaining.</p> <p>The German government has defended the ESM treaty, claiming it would fix Germany's maximum liability at \u20ac190bn, and that the Bundestag would retain control over the grant of further assistance. Either German politicians have not read the treaty they have signed, or they do not understand its small print, for there is little in the document that supports their interpretation. Because the ESM is plainly unlawful.</p> <p>For example, article 25(2) of the treaty states that members are jointly liable for any losses arising from loans made by the ESM. That means if one or more of the ESM members fail to meet their agreed financial contributions, the other members are liable for the shortfall. That situation is already a reality, because Greece and Portugal are unable to make any contribution.</p> <p>Article 21 further authorises the ESM to borrow on the capital markets, from banks or from other financial institutions, which presumably includes the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank\" title=\"\">European Central Bank</a>. There is no overall borrowing limit. The ESM effectively provides for the possibility of monetary state financing through the ECB. ESM members are again jointly and severally liable for all losses that may be incurred on money borrowed by the ESM to lend more money that cannot be repaid. Worse, those receiving the money are at the same time liable for any losses from bad debts \u2013 they are lending the money to themselves. If they are insolvent, their share of the loss will have to be borne by those still able to pay. Payer countries thus pay twice \u2013 for their share of the loss, and that share of the loss the defaulting country lent to itself.</p> <p>Contrary to the position of the German government, the ESM does not contain any limit on the extent of any member state's overall liability. If the ESM governors issue shares in excess of their nominal value, issue bonds or borrow from the ECB, and only one or two states become insolvent or leave the eurozone, Germany's exposure under the ESM could easily rise to between \u20ac400bn and \u20ac500bn. If the crisis worsens, Germany's likely ESM losses could exceed \u20ac700bn. That would push up its public debt to 110% of GDP and beyond.</p> <p>Germany's federal budget has a size of slightly over \u20ac300bn per annum. The ESM would, on realistic assumptions, increase Germany's exposure to losses in the weaker eurozone economies by between one and a half and twice the size of the federal budget. If Germany's other potential liabilities as an ECB shareholder and its additional aid to Greece, Ireland and Spain are taken into account, total exposure could reach a sum equivalent to four or five times the size of the federal budget.</p> <p>Even if only part of Germany's total claims against other eurozone governments eventually have to be written off, the loss would run into hundreds of billions and effectively extinguish the Bundestag's financial room for manoeuvre \u2013 its budgetary autonomy \u2013 for a generation and beyond.</p> <p>The ESM is not only patently in breach of the German constitution, it also violates every relevant provision of the EU treaties. Article 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) \u2013 which replaced the EC treaty \u2013 forbids the use of the printing press to bankroll governments and public authorities, makes it unlawful for them to borrow from the ECB or the national central banks, and expressly prohibits the sale of government bonds to the ECB.</p> <p>The ESM would create a parallel \"bad bank\", which would be allowed to do everything the ECB is ostensibly prevented from doing under the treaties: to buy government bonds directly, to lend to national government, to grant such loans without any prescribed limit, and to rescue insolvent banks. Once the ESM runs out of money, it can borrow directly from the ECB \u2013 which will print the funds needed.</p> <p>Moreover, the ECB president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi\" title=\"\">Mario Draghi</a>, has already indicated that he would take bond buys by the ESM as a green light that the ECB is no longer bound by the restrictions of article 123. At present the ECB has about \u20ac220bn in sub-standard Greek and other southern European government bonds on its balance sheet, in addition to much a higher sum of \"shaky\" government debt instruments deposited by banks as \"securities\" for ECB loans. Draghi refuses to disclose the breakdown of government debt on the ECB's books or their credit rating. The ESM treaty effectively provides for the mutualisation of national debt within the EU with no upper limit. Save for eurobonds, there could be no more flagrant violation of the \"no bail\" clause of article 125.</p> <p>Unless wages can be depressed further, inflation will eventually rise significantly due to the combined effect of an increase in the money supply and a depreciation of the euro, with resulting increases in import prices \u2013 especially of oil and gas. That trend will accelerate every time the ECB fires its so-called \"big bazooka\". Draghi has waited for the opportune moment, and is inaugurating the \"lirafication\" of the euro, the redefinition of the eurozone along Italian lines. Nothing could be more antithetical to the original \"Bundesbank\" model for the ECB and Article 127 TFEU, which says price stability and maintenance of the euro's purchasing power are the ECB's primary objectives.</p> <p>Yet, despite the ESM breaching German law and EU treaties, few observers expect Germany's constitutional court to say so, although many think it may ask for minor changes.</p> <p>If implemented, the ESM will reverse the greatest 19th-century political achievement in Europe: the transfer of the power to determine taxation and expenditure from unaccountable monarchical governments to formally accountable parliaments. The eurocratic transformation will have taken place through systematic disregard by the EU institutions and its member states of practically all legal and constitutional safeguards put in place to prevent precisely the disaster that has befallen the eurozone now.</p> <p>In the 18th century, the Landgrave of&#xa0;Hesse sold thousands of men into military service for the British crown. Today Germany's political establishment seems committed to consigning German taxpayers to economic serfdom and stagflation for at least a generation \u2013&#xa0;not for gold, to be fair, but for the euro, to assuage the markets and to appease international opinion. The issue is: will the German constitutional court take itself and the German voter seriously? Law, one had better remind oneself, is the continuation of politics by other means.<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>Called upon at the start of the credit crunch to explain the collapse in value of a Goldman Sachs investment fund, the bank's chief financial officer did some high-net-worth head-scratching: \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d2121cb6-49cb-11dc-9ffe-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz25yhrr4ur\" title=\"\">We were seeing things that were 25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row</a>.\" Which all sounds plausibly lofty and technical until you are reminded of the observation from <a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/33382946/Tim%20Harford%20The%20Undercover%20Economist%20Chapter%206.pdf\" title=\"\">the economist Tim Harford</a> that one wouldn't expect to see three 25-standard deviation days in a row for far longer than the 13bn years the universe has been in existence. Goldman's David Viniar was effectively saying that his models weren't at fault; it was reality that was wrong.</p> <p>Laughable though that sounds, financial regulators \u2013 the people paid to protect the rest of us from overconfident financiers \u2013 have trusted the bankers and their highly sophisticated models of risk. Indeed, the watchdogs have themselves adopted ever more complex models of risk \u2013 thus taking the bankers at their own word. As the Bank of England's Andy Haldane points out in an important new paper, <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2012/speech596.pdf\" title=\"\">The Dog and the Frisbee</a>, the first international Basel rules on finance reached in 1988 ran to only 30 pages. The latest incarnation, Basel III, weighs in at 616 pages. In America, the Dodd-Frank act on financial regulation is more than 20 times as long as Glass-Steagall, the 1933 law that split investment banks away from savings banks. All this complexity costs: the number of people employed in the UK's financial sector has barely increased over the past 20 years (despite the lobbyists' promises, finance does not create jobs); the number of regulators has leapt almost six-fold.</p> <p>Yet all this detail and sophistication is a less effective guide to regulation than the old trusty rules of thumb. As Mr Haldane effectively demonstrates, looking at how much banks had borrowed by the end of 2006 \u2013 their leverage ratio \u2013 would have been a better predictor of which would go bust than all the rest of the armoury. As the Bank's head of financial stability sums up: \"Modern finance is ... too complex... As you do not fight fire with fire, you do not fight complexity with complexity.\"</p> <p>Two obvious conclusions flow from this. The first is that financial economics is heading back towards the world as Keynes and Hayek knew it: where economic uncertainty was recognised as such, rather than mathematised and missold as controllable risks. Second, that regulators really ought to deal with bankers using a regime of brutal simplicity that errs of the side of caution. If a bank looks like it's borrowed too much, it probably has \u2013 no matter what the risk models say \u2013 and should be stopped. Mr Haldane's view makes far more sense than that described in the Basel agreements or Vickers commission: and in its simplicity, it is pleasingly radical.</p>",
  "<p>According to Victoria Pendleton, British <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/cycling\" title=\"\">Cycling</a> has already sold off her bike. Some staff members will probably never speak to her again. She suspects they will be relieved not to have to deal with her any more. She tells me all this with a twinkly, tinkling laugh, the kind people adopt when they are trying especially hard not to sound bitter. The words ring in my head as I hang up the phone after our second conversation. I feel unexpectedly gutted. I had anticipated writing a fairly straightforward story about a champion \u2013 a complicated champion, yes, but one who had experienced familiar ebbs of struggle and glory on the way to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/19/olympics.cycling\" title=\"\">Olympic gold</a> at Beijing, followed by those wild, psychological battles in London, where she won gold in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/03/victoria-pendleton-london-olympics\" title=\"\">keirin</a>, silver in the sprint. Instead, the tale of Queen Vic feels much darker.</p> <p>This hadn't come across so strongly at our first meeting. At that stage I had only been given the first half of her autobiography, Between the Lines, written with Guardian sports interviewer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/donaldmcrae\" title=\"\">Donald McRae</a>. This covered some difficulties in her path to Olympic success, but nothing too extreme or extraordinary.</p> <p>Pendleton is immensely friendly when we meet at the St Pancras Renaissance hotel, London, with an openness people probably either find brilliant or totally unnerving. She is renowned for being nakedly emotional, sobbing when she loses \u2013 sobbing when she wins. \"I'm someone who wears their heart on their sleeve,\" she says. \"I find it hard to act other than the way I feel.\"</p> <p>She is suffering from a throat infection, which flared up predictably in the wake of her Olympic training, so pops a few pills as we start. If some of her comments have an obvious, umbilical connection to past problems \u2013 she never bites a medal for photographers, she says, because it would be like \"licking a handrail\", reminding me of her compulsive teenage hand washing \u2013 well, none of it seems too troubling either.</p> <p>What comes across from the start is her quest for approval, specifically from men. The more desperate she has been to achieve this, the more it seems to have pushed people away. We talk about her earliest memory, and she says it is probably of watching her father race. Max Pendleton was a star amateur cyclist when she was growing up, and the book begins with him riding away from her up a hill, as she struggles to catch him, with the words \"he doesn't love me, he doesn't love me,\" beating through her head.</p> <p>Her other earliest memory is of being on the back of a yellow tricycle, ridden by her father, alongside her twin brother Alex. When they were four, Alex was pricked by a wild rose thorn that caused blood poisoning; he then had leukaemia. The illness came on suddenly, she says, and she remembers the moment he was rushed to hospital with perfect clarity. Was she worried? \"I was <em>very</em> worried.\" She began praying intently, night and day.</p> <p>Alex recovered, but their parents continued to watch him carefully; Pendleton writes that she sometimes \"had to fight to get noticed as much\", although life was pretty rosy beyond that. She began cycling at six, on the back of her dad's tandem, then racing with Alex, aged nine. For years he and the rest of the field \u2013 the juvenile group went up to 16 \u2013 would usually beat her. But Pendleton pursued cycling anyway, because she just \"wanted to be good at something,\" she says, with a note of desperation. \"I was just, like, all I want to do is be really good at something. Really, really good at something, so people are vaguely impressed by me.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395899805\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347042363599/Pendleton-in-action-in-th-010.jpg\" alt=\"Pendleton in action in the velodrome.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pendleton in action in the velodrome. Photograph: Visionhaus</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visionhaus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By her mid-teens she was beating Alex, and when they were 15, he gave up cycling, as their older sister Nicola had before. She uses an interesting phrase to describe this, writing that Alex \"saw his chance and took it\", as if he was escaping a kidnapping. Did she wish she had given up then, too? \"At times I felt like, 'Ah, I wish I'd been first to get out,' and then I was like: 'No, but those two would have both quit anyway, and Dad would be left with no one to cycle with.'\" Couldn't he have cycled alone? She laughs. \"Yeah, I know! He had lots of friends to cycle with anyway.\"</p> <p>But there was no giving up. She felt responsible for her father's mood. Did the pressure bother her? \"Oh gosh, yeah.\" If she was invited out on a Saturday night by friends, it meant she wouldn't be properly rested for cycling, and she would \"be filled with guilt,\" she says. \"Should I go, shouldn't I go? I really want to, but no. I'll go with Dad, and I'll go to the race, because that's more important, keeping him happy, than it is keeping [a friend] happy, and yourself happy ... You know, I didn't have to do it. If I'd had the strength of character to say, 'Actually, no, I'm not going this weekend,' I would have done. But I didn't.\"</p> <p>When she was 16, the national track team noticed Pendleton's talent, and she was invited to Manchester to ride at the velodrome. But she wasn't set on pursuing a track career yet. One of her most interesting qualities is her ambivalence about cycling. Where most champions seem powered by a blinkered obsession, she is much more clear-eyed. For instance, she fully recognises that sport is essentially entertainment, and finds this comforting. \"When you're in that bubble, training in that environment, with all those personalities who want you to win <em>so</em> desperately ... You think it's life or death. It feels like if you don't win you're going to be hung, drawn and quartered.\"</p> <p>But she remembers watching track cycling on television last year, \"and I was like, this is the most ridiculous sport on earth. Riding around a wooden bowl, with a bike with no brakes ... And it was just like \u2026\" She takes a big sigh. \"Aaaaaah, it doesn't mean I don't take the training incredibly seriously. But at the end of the day, it's just a bike race.\"</p> <p>She arrived at Northumbria University to study sport science, and started going to the gym every day. By her final year she was spending a week each month training with the British cycling team in Manchester. It was a male-dominated environment, and it is clear she felt an unworthy outsider at first, training alongside the men's elite squad, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/chrishoy\" title=\"\">Chris Hoy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/bradleywiggins\" title=\"\">Bradley Wiggins</a>. \"I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm rubbish. I don't even know what I'm doing' ... It really didn't feel like I fitted in. Not that they made me feel that way \u2013 the guys were always very friendly, but I did feel like a complete novice.\"</p> <p>In 2002, she came fifth in the sprint at the World Cup in China. Not long afterwards she went to train at a sprint academy in Aigle, in the Swiss Alps, under French cyclist, <a href=\"http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ma/frederic-magne-1.html\" title=\"\">Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Magn\u00e9</a>. \"Within the first two weeks,\" she says. \"I thought I was going to die. My eyes were totally sunk in the back of my head. I had bags under my eyes. I was so tired. I was like: how do people do this for a living?\"</p> <p>As the months went on, she began to doubt herself. She felt she needed to work on her core strength, and began to exercise outside her prescribed training programme. This angered Magn\u00e9. \"I had always feared letting down figures of authority,\" Pendleton writes, \"my dad most of all, and so I felt diminished by disappointing Fred.\"</p> <p>She had started cutting her arms with a Swiss Army Knife, and as their relationship deteriorated she continued. \"I'd been training really hard,\" she says, \"and my progression had been very slow ... I just dwelled on the negativity of being stuck in that little room in Switzerland, by myself, feeling like a failure ... Thank the Lord, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/may/08/4\" title=\"\">Steve Peters</a> came along, because if I hadn't met him, I think I probably would have left Switzerland, and given up.\"</p> <p>Peters, a psychiatrist, had been sent out to see her by British Cycling; the two connected instantly. So much so, he apparently introduced her once to his students as his \"greatest success\". He gave her \"some options,\" she says. \"'You are in control of this Vicky. You do have the power, and the ability, to retrain the way you think right now, and get out of this situation'.\"</p> <p>Pendleton headed home in 2004, before a disappointing first Olympics in Athens, where she came ninth in the sprint. But it wasn't long before she hit a winning streak, claiming the world championship in the event the next year. She has won nine world titles altogether, six in the sprint. Then, in 2006, she met Scott Gardner, an Australian performance analyst who had joined the British team, and after a frosty start, they fell in love.</p> <p>Both knew this wasn't allowed; a relationship between a member of the coaching staff and an athlete was considered unprofessional. \"We knew Scott would lose his job,\" she says, \"so that was an accepted part of us deciding to go on a date for the first time.\"</p> <p>Once they had decided they were serious, they told <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/01/shane-sutton-red-white-blue\" title=\"\">Shane Sutton</a>, head coach at British Cycling; he and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/dave-brailsford\" title=\"\">Dave Brailsford</a>, the performance director, agreed the relationship should be kept quiet in the buildup to Beijing. There, at the Games, Pendleton rode to triumph, confirming her position as a towering champion, the best female sprinter in the world.</p> <p>It should have been a moment of celebration, but all she felt was \"deadened incomprehension\", she writes. And these feelings didn't improve over the next few days. Sutton and Brailsford decided the news of her relationship with Scott had to come out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395899806\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347042216748/With-boyfriend-Scott-Gard-010.jpg\" alt=\"With boyfriend Scott Gardner after winning silver in the sprint this summer.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With boyfriend Scott Gardner after winning silver in the sprint this summer. Photograph: Andy Stenning</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Stenning</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was the part of Pendleton's book I had reached when we first met, but I knew some of what happened afterward: the fallout from the revelation of their relationship, Scott having to leave his job. I just couldn't work out what was behind the continuing rift with the team's staff. After she won her medals at the London Olympics this summer, for instance \u2013 medals that marked the end of her cycling career \u2013 she and some of the senior staff didn't even exchange proper goodbyes.</p> <p>One was Jan van Eijden, her full-time sprint coach, the man responsible for holding her on the bike at the start of each race. They had a great working relationship before she became involved with Gardner, so it was difficult to understand why he would be so angry. Towards the end of her book though, the chronology breaks, as she reflects back on the night after she won her gold medal in Beijing. At this point, parts of the picture become clearer.</p> <p>Van Eijden had just found out about her relationship with Gardner, and the three were having a furious row. \"I was so shocked at the severity of his reaction,\" she tells me, when we speak again over the phone. \"I thought he might be a bit annoyed, but the fact that he was literally raging, livid, was shocking. He was disgusted in what we'd done, thought we were unprofessional, disrespectful and we'd betrayed him. All these words which, personally, for me, they're not words that people use. Because I'm not that kind of person. I'm very by the book, you know? I don't like breaking rules. For someone to describe my character, and Scott's character, in such derogatory terms, was very hurtful.\"</p> <p>She was so upset that she found a pair of nail scissors and cut herself in front of the two men. I wonder if, after this, some staff were scared of her. A colleague who reacts to a row by cutting themselves is someone you might be both worried for, and wary of. When I suggest this, she says she doesn't \"think anybody knew about it apart from Jan\". Perhaps that's true, but it's the sort of story that has the potential to spread quickly around a workplace, particularly one where psychology is so central. \"I don't think anyone will know until they read it,\" she says, \"if they read it.\"</p> <p>Has she had any reactions to the book yet from the team? \"No, I don't imagine they'd speak to me any more, anyway, to be honest. I'm not imagining I'll have much contact with them. As it is, they've sold my bike already.\" She is close friends with some of the team, but there are certain key members, \"who I am sure will be very happy not to have to deal with me ever again, and I think they'd probably be quite open about expressing that too. And I don't blame them, because if I've hurt them with my actions, I can't change it. It's something I'm going to have to live with, and I'm sorry it caused people such distress. But I'm in love with Scott, and I wouldn't change that. I'm very happy with him.\"</p> <p>The hardest part was \"if it had been any other kind of job, I might have been able to change organisations, and carry on doing the job somewhere else. But I had no other options. I can't change nationality, and I wanted to represent Great Britain.\" There were times when her relationship with Van Eijden was so bad that she almost felt: \"I don't want to win because he takes the credit for it, and really I don't feel he's part of my performance, any more, in some respects. But I would never do that, because I would never compromise my end result. But these thoughts would run around my mind sometimes, when I was feeling particularly low.\"</p> <p>She is \"pretty worried\" about the book coming out, she says. \"Because I have been fairly open and honest about a lot of issues \u2013 but I haven't told any lies \u2026 I was worried about British Cycling being annoyed that I've kind of, well, not talked them down, but haven't necessarily portrayed them in a glowing light ... For so many years I've had to talk about how amazing the programme is, and how well supported I am, and at times I haven't really felt 100% supported by that, but it's my job, it's what I have to say. And I'm still performing, so people are like \u2013 well, why are you still producing gold medals then, if it's so bad? It makes for a very difficult situation, and I don't want to be coming across as the whingy whiner, but I'm the only one to complain, so no one else has a problem.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think that I'm a particularly complicated person to work with,\" she says. \"But I'm not a robot. And if they've learned anything, I hope they've learned that they need to approach working with the girls in the team a little bit more sensitively than they have in the past. Because if everything I've been through has done that then it's been a success. And it would be nice that it's been worth it in the long run, because I do feel that somewhere that a lot of sports, and my sport in particular, fall short is the level of support for the men and the women is so different. They seem to know what men need, but they don't really seem to understand how to get the best out of the women.\"It can't help that so few of the senior staff are women. \"There's nobody with any power, female,\" she replies bluntly. \"And they need that, in my opinion.\"</p> <p>Pendleton is such a mixture of parts; a rock and indie kid, with a Smashing Pumpkins lyric tattooed on her wrist, who also revels in fashion. She says it's going to be liberating, to do whatever she wants, \"and not feel responsible! The only person I'm going to let down is me, if I don't do very well at my next job. I'm just going to have a whole year of trying new stuff.\" She plans to marry Gardner in 2013, and after that she'll start thinking about a serious career choice. \"I've always had this one thing overriding my lifestyle since I was nine. I have never missed a racing season since 1989. Having a year to make up for all that commitment is not unreasonable.\"</p> <p>She loved her Olympics experience this year, despite the disappointment of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/02/victoria-pendleton-pain-olympic-sprint\" title=\"\">disqualification</a> in the team sprint, and relegation in the first race of the individual sprint final too. When she won gold in the keirin, she says she felt: \"Oh, I'm so happy right now. This is amazing. I sung the national anthem, because I would anyway, but it was the only thing that stopped me from blubbering completely on the podium\".</p> <p>It would have been so easy to leave the self-harm material out of the book. It's not as if she's short of drama. But she says she wanted to send a message to other people that you could have problems like these, get past them, and succeed. \"I'm not the perfect model of what an athlete should be, mentally or physically,\" she says, \"but I've worked very hard to be as close to that as I possibly can, and it's taken time, effort and practice. It's not something that comes naturally, I wasn't born with it ... If you're willing to work, you can be better. You can be the best, there's nothing stopping you.\" The question is, would you want to?</p>",
  "<p>Vince Cable reasserted his control over the business department on Sunday as he dismissed rightwing claims that further business deregulation is the key to growth, and readied a series of announcements on the economy including the rejection of \"fire at will\" employment laws.</p> <p>Cable will this week make three growth-related announcements covering no-fault dismissal, the removal of a chunk of health and safety legislation and a long-term industrial policy likely to include plans for a small business bank. The scale of the bank and the details to be announced on Tuesday were discussed over the weekend.</p> <p>Cable also lifted the veil on his continuing dispute with the home secretary, Theresa May, saying he would be delighted to wield an axe over \"the enormous amount of red tape around the whole immigration system, permits for workers, visas for people coming from China, students\". He has long complained about Home Office controls on skilled workers.</p> <p>There have been suggestions that the reshuffle put rightwing ministers such as Michael Fallon in Cable's department to strengthen the voice of business.</p> <p>Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Cable rejected the reports and angered some on the right by conceding the supply-side reforms he is to announce this week will not transform the outlook.</p> <p>\"The problem of growth is that we have a very serious shortage of demand. It's nothing to do with those supply side measures basically. It's a demand issue.\"</p> <p>His remarks were echoed by the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Simon Hughes, who admitted \"Plan A was not enough\", adding: \"Growth hasn't come nearly as quickly as people thought and hoped, the levers that have been pulled haven't adequately worked.\"Cable will make three announcements, starting with plans to scrap or overhaul more than 3,000 of 6,000 regulations for which the UK is responsible by 2013. David Cameron has described the rules as a \"health and safety monster\" stemming from the EU.</p> <p>He will also promise to abolish health and safety inspections unless firms are operating in higher risk areas such as construction or energy, or if they have a record of poor performance. The right to compensation is also to be cut back. It was stressed that the initiatives were cleared with Conservatives well before the reshuffle.</p> <p>On Tuesday Cable will set out an industrial strategy building on a framework document published last October, and focusing on how government can support technological innovation as well as industries of the future such as energy, the automotive industry and science. Discussions continue on whether a small business bank will be announced. George Osborne has said the idea would bring together \"all the alphabet soup of existing schemes\" available to small businesses. Cable would like the bank to have real powers to lend and not be merely \"a one stop shop\" for small business.</p> <p>Later in the week Cable will reject proposals from the Beecroft report, completed last October, that would allow micro-employers to dismiss staff without risk of redress other than some financial compensation. Cable said government consultation showed minimal business support for the idea, adding that greater job insecurity was undesirable at a time of low consumer confidence. Britain anyway has very flexible labour markets, he said. \"There is job insecurity, we don't want to add to it. That's why we're not going down the no-fault dismissal line.\"</p> <p>He will instead propose a statutory code of practice to encourage voluntary settlement agreements for micro-businesses, allowing staff to agree to leave a company in return for a payment. Offers made by businesses could not be used as evidence in an unfair dismissal case.</p> <p>This would act as an alternative to going to an employment tribunal, which can be costly and time-consuming, and, according to businesses, makes employers less inclined to hire staff.</p> <p>Cable said he was not interested in the Liberal Democrat leadership, but admitted he \"very, very occasionally\" talks with Labour leader Ed Miliband.</p> <p>He also said he was not embarrassed to describe himself as a \"centre-left\" politician. \"I do believe in fairness and income distribution, and I also believe in having a successful business sector and competition, a market economy. Those two things have got to be married together. That's the big challenge of politicians in the Western world.\"</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, heaped praise on Cable, saying: \"Vince has distinguished himself by always making the argument about what's right for Britain.\"</p> <p>He questioned whether Nick Clegg would also describe himself as a centre-left politician and added: \"I would be very surprised if Nick Clegg fights the next election for the Liberal Democrats, and I don't think it's in the Liberal Democrat or in the national interest.\"</p>",
  "<p>As Republicans were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/republicans-hurricane-mitt-romney-ann\" title=\"\">promoting themselves as a multiracial party</a> from the platform in Tampa two weeks ago,&#xa0;an ugly incident on the convention floor suggested not everyone had got the memo. From the podium a range of speakers of Haitian, Mexican, Cuban and Indian descent spoke of how their parents had overcome huge barriers so they could succeed in the US. In the audience, a successful black woman who works for CNN was being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/republican-national-convention-race-tampa\" title=\"\">pelted with peanuts</a> by a convention-goer, who said: \"This is how we feed the animals.\"</p> <p>The tension between the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/169746/behind-gops-diversity-display\" title=\"\">projection of a modern, inclusive, tolerant party</a> and the reality of a sizeable racially intolerant element within its base pining for the restoration of white privilege is neither new nor accidental. Indeed, it in no small part explains the trajectory of the Republican party for almost the last&#xa0;half century. In his diary, Richard Nixon's chief-of-staff, Bob Haldeman, described how his boss spelled out the racial contours of a new electoral game-plan to win southern and suburban whites over to the Republican party in the wake of the civil rights era. \"You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks,\" Nixon told him. \"The key is to devise a system that recognises that while not appearing to.\"</p> <p>This could be the final hurrah for what became known as Nixon's southern strategy in what is shaping up to be the most racially polarised election ever. Black support for the Republican party literally cannot get any lower. A recent <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/21/13399788-nbcwsj-poll-heading-into-conventions-obama-has-four-point-lead NBC/\" title=\"\">Wall Street Journal poll</a> had 0% of African-Americans saying they intend to vote for Romney. At 32%, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx\" title=\"\">support among Latinos is higher</a> but still remains pathetically low given what Republicans need to win (40%) and what they have had in the past \u2013 in 2004 George W Bush won 44%. As a result, the party of Lincoln is increasingly dependent on just one section of the electorate \u2013 white people. To win, Romney needs 61% of the white vote from a white turnout of 74%. That's a lot. In 2008, John McCain got 55% from the same turnout. \"<a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/politics/obama-needs-80-of-minority-vote-to-win-2012-presidential-election-20120824\" title=\"\">This is&#xa0;the last time anyone will try to do this</a>,\" one Republican strategist told the&#xa0;National Journal. And Republican consultant Ana Navarro <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-republican-minority-party-20120829,0,3047039.story\" title=\"\">told the Los Angeles Times</a>: \"Where his numbers are right now, we should be pressing the panic button.\"</p> <p>There are two main reasons for this panic. The first is that the \"system\" Nixon referred to is now recognisable by most \u2013 particularly with a black president in the White House. As people have become more attuned to the frequency of the dog whistles, the tone has necessarily become more shrill. During the primaries, <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/165576/gops-blatant-racism\" title=\"\">Rick Santorum told a crowd in New Hampshire</a>: \"I don't want to make black people's lives better by giving them somebody else's money; I want to give them the opportunity to go out and earn the money.\" Newt Gingrich branded Obama \"<a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-25/gingrich-calling-obama-food-stamp-president-draws-critics.html\" title=\"\">the food stamp president</a>\". Just a few weeks ago, in a clear nod to the \"birthers\", who insist Obama was not born in the US, the party's nominee, <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/romney-makes-a-birther-joke-while-campaigning/\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney, went to Michigan and joked</a>: \"No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this&#xa0;is the place that we were born and raised.\" This is rhetorical peanut throwing. When everyone can hear it, you've transitioned from a dog whistle to a straight-up whistle.</p> <p>Second, with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/us/politics/obama-may-still-have-an-ally-in-wisconsin-demographics.html\" title=\"\">white people destined to become a minority</a> in a few decades, the strategy is no longer an anchor but a millstone. Tying Republican fortunes to the white vote made electoral sense in the early 1970s. Since 1980, the white share of the electorate has fallen in every consecutive election bar one \u2013 1996, when Ross Perot ran. The more black and Latino voters the Republicans alienate, the more white voters they need to replace them. The trouble is they are fishing for a larger number in a smaller pool, which demands ever more juicy bait. \"The demographics race we're losing badly,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham, acknowledging the problem. \"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> <p>But that's not for want of trying. In just one example, the New York Times' <a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/making-the-election-about-race/\" title=\"\">Thomas Edsall analyses</a> a Romney ad lambasting Obama's healthcare reform. The ad states: \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4gPvToKTWU\" title=\"\">You paid into Medicare for years</a> \u2013 every pay check. Now when you need it, Obama has cut $716bn from Medicare. Why? To pay for Obamacare. The money you paid for your guaranteed healthcare is going to a massive new government programme that is not for&#xa0;you.\"</p> <p>Leave aside the fact that the ad is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/20/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-cuts-716-medicare-pay-obamacare/\" title=\"\">judged by Politifact as only half true</a> and that the Republican vice-presidential candidate <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/15/news/la-pn-romney-paul-ryan-medicare-cuts-20120815\" title=\"\">Paul Ryan has proposed a budget</a> that would cut a similar amount from Medicare without healthcare reform. More than three-quarters of Medicare recipients are white; more than half those without health insurance are not white. By linking the two in this way, \"Obamacare\" thereby becomes a transfer of resources from hard working white retirees to indigent minority ethnic people. Meanwhile, Larry McCarthy, who produced the now infamously racist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC9j6Wfdq3o\" title=\"\">Willie Horton ad</a> for George HW Bush's campaign in 1988, is working for one of the Super Pac's backing Romney.</p> <p>Describing the evolution of the Republicans' racial appeal, the late Lee Atwater, one-time chair of the Republican National Committee and member of the Reagan administration, <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6DF1E30F935A35753C1A9639C8B63\" title=\"\">said in 1981</a>. \"You start out in 1954 by saying, 'Nigger, nigger, nigger'.

  "<p><em>[Updated below - Update II (Mon.)]</em></p> <p>In October 2003, the intensely pro-US president of Bolivia, Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada, sent his security forces to suppress growing popular protests <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/world/bolivia-s-poor-proclaim-abiding-distrust-of-globalization.html?\">against the government's energy and globalization policies</a>. Using high-powered rifles and machine guns, his military forces killed 67 men, women and children, and injured 400 more, almost all of whom were poor and from the nation's indigenous Aymara communities. Dozens of protesters had been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/14/world/bolivian-president-remains-defiant-as-protests-intensify.html?\">killed by government forces</a> in the prior months when troops were sent to suppress them.</p> <p>The resulting outrage over what became known as \"the Gas Wars\" <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/18/world/bolivian-leader-resigns-and-his-vice-president-steps-in.html?\">drove Sanchez de Lozada from office</a> and then into exile in the United States, where he was welcomed by his close allies in the Bush administration. He has lived under a shield of asylum in the US ever since.</p> <p>The Bolivians, however, have never stopped attempting to bring their former leader to justice for what they insist are his genocide and crimes against humanity: namely, ordering the killing of indigenous peaceful protesters in cold blood (as <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1586707,00.html\">Time Magazine put it</a>: \"according to witnesses, the military fired indiscriminately and without warning in El Alto neighborhoods\"). In 2007, Bolivian prosecutors <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7050273.stm\">formally charged him</a> with genocide for the October 2003 incident, charges which were <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1586707,00.html\">approved by the nation's supreme court</a>. </p> <p>Bolivia then <a href=\"http://jurist.org/paperchase/2008/11/bolivia-officials-request-extradition.php\">demanded his extradition</a> from the US for him to stand trial. That demand, ironically, was made pursuant to an extradition treaty signed by S\u00e1nchez de Lozada himself with the US. Civil lawsuits <a href=\"http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/mamani-v-sanchez\">have also been filed</a> against him in the US on behalf of the surviving victims.</p> <p>The view that S\u00e1nchez de Lozada must be extradited from the US to stand trial is a political consensus in Bolivia, shared by the government and the main opposition party alike. But on Friday night, the <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-07/news/sns-rt-us-bolivia-usabre88614o-20120907_1_president-evo-morales-extradition-coca-farmer\">Bolivian government revealed</a> that it had just been notified by the Obama administration that the US government has refused Bolivia's extradition request:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'Yesterday (Thursday), a document arrived from the United States, rejecting the extradition of people who have done a lot of damage to Bolivia,' leftist [President Evo] Morales, an outspoken critic of US foreign policy in Latin America, said in a speech.</p> <p>\"Calling the United States a 'paradise of impunity' and a 'refuge for criminals,' Morales said Washington turned down the extradition request on the grounds that a civilian leader cannot be tried for crimes committed by the military \u2026</p> <p>\"Sanchez de Lozada's extradition was also demanded by opposition leaders in Bolivia and they criticized the US decision.</p> <p>\"Rogelio Mayta, a lawyer representing victims of the 2003 violence, said 'the US protection' of Sanchez de Lozada was not surprising.</p> <p>\"'It's yet another display of the US government's double moral standard,' he said.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Because he has yet to be tried, I have no opinion on whether S\u00e1nchez de Lozada is guilty of the crimes with which he has been formally charged (Bolivian courts <a href=\"http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/08/bolivia-high-court-convicts-7-officials-for-genocide.php\">have convicted</a> several other military officers on genocide charges in connection with these shootings). But the refusal of the Obama administration to allow him to stand trial for what are obviously very serious criminal allegations is completely consistent with American conceptions of justice and is worth examining for that reason.</p> <p>Let's begin with two vital facts about the former Bolivian leader.</p> <p>First, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada was exactly the type of America-revering-and-obeying leader the US has always wanted for other nations, especially smaller ones with important energy resources. When he was driven into exile in October 2003, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/world/bolivian-leader-s-ouster-seen-as-warning-on-us-drug-policy.html?\">described him</a> as \"Washington's most stalwart ally in South America\".</p> <p>The former leader \u2013 a multimillionaire mining executive who, having been educated in the US, spoke Spanish with a heavy American accent \u2013 was a loyal partner in America's drug war in the region. More importantly, the former leader himself was a vehement proponent and relentless crusader for free trade and free market policies favored by the US: policies that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/world/bolivia-s-poor-proclaim-abiding-distrust-of-globalization.html?ref=gonzalosanchezdelozada\">the nation's indigenous poor long believed</a> (with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/20/world/bolivian-peasants-ideology-of-fury-still-smolders.html?\">substantial basis</a>) resulted in their impoverishment while enriching Bolivia's small Europeanized elite.</p> <p>It was S\u00e1nchez de Lozada's forced exile that ultimately led to the 2006 election and 2009 landslide re-election of Morales, a figure the New York Times in October 2003 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/world/bolivian-leader-s-ouster-seen-as-warning-on-us-drug-policy.html?\">described as</a> one \"regarded by Washington as its main enemy\". Morales has been as vehement an opponent of globalization and free trade as S\u00e1nchez de Lozada was a proponent, and has constantly opposed US interference in his region and elsewhere (in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20046315-503544.html\">Morales called</a> for the revocation of Obama's Nobel Peace Prize as a result of the intervention in Libya).</p> <p>So, this extradition refusal is, in one sense, a classic and common case of the US exploiting pretenses of law and justice to protect its own leaders and those of its key allies from the rule of law, even when faced with allegations of the most egregious wrongdoing. If the Obama DOJ <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/obama-justice-department-immunity-bush-cia-torturer\">so aggressively shielded</a> accused Bush war criminals from all forms of accountability, it is hardly surprising that it does the same for loyal US puppets. That a government that defies US dictates is thwarted and angered in the process is just an added bonus. That, too, is par for the course. </p> <p>But there's another important aspect of this case that distinguishes it from the standard immunity Washington gifts to itself and its friends. When he ran for president in 2002, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada was deeply unpopular among the vast majority of Bolivians as a result of his prior four-year term as president in the 1990s. To find a way to win despite this, he hired the consulting firm owned and operated by three of Washington's most well-connected Democratic party operatives: James Carville, Stan Greenberg and Bob Shrum. He asked them to import the tactics of American politics into Bolivia to ensure his election victory. </p> <p>As detailed by a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/movies/26fore.html?_r=1\">2006 New York Times review</a> of a film about the Democratic operatives' involvement in Bolivia's election, their strategy was two-fold: first, destroy the reputations of his two opponents so as to depress the enthusiasm of Bolivia's poor for either of them; and then mobilize S\u00e1nchez de Lozada's base of elites to ensure he wins by a tiny margin. That strategy worked, as he was elected with a paltry 22.5% of the popular vote. From the Times review:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'[The film] asks a more probing question: whether Mr Carville and company, in selling a pro-globalization, pro-American candidate, can export American-style campaigning and values to a country so fundamentally different from the United States \u2026</p> <p>\"'It's a very explosive film in Bolivia because it shows close up a very deliberate strategy,' said Jim Shultz, an American political analyst in Bolivia who recently saw the film with a group of friends. 'The film is especially explosive because it's about a candidate \u2013 so identified with the United States and so hated by so many Bolivians \u2013 being put into office by the political manipulations of US consultants.'</p> <p>\"Mauro Quispe, 33, a cabdriver in La Paz, said he saw slices of the film on the television news, and it raised his ire. 'I was stunned,' he said. 'He was being advised by the Americans, and everything they said was in English.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There's no evidence, at least of which I'm aware, that any of these Democratic operatives intervened on behalf of their former client in his extradition pleas to the Obama administration, but it rather obviously did not hurt. At the very least, shielding a former leader deposed by his own people from standing trial for allegedly gunning down unarmed civilians takes on an even uglier image when that former leader had recently had leading US Democratic operatives on his payroll.</p> <p>Then, there are the very revealing parallels between this case and the recent decision by Ecuador to grant asylum to Julian Assange, until his fears of political persecution from being extradited to Sweden are resolved. Remember all those voices who were so deeply outraged at Ecuador's decision? Given that he faces criminal complaints in Sweden, they proclaimed, protecting Assange with asylum constitutes a violent assault on the rule of law.</p> <p>Do you think any of the people who attacked Ecuador on that ground will raise a peep of protest at what the US did here in shielding this former leader from facing charges of genocide and crimes against humanity back in his own country? In contrast to Ecuador \u2013 which is fervently seeking an agreement to allow Assange to go to Sweden to face those allegations while simultaneously protecting his political rights \u2013 the US has done nothing, and is doing nothing, to ensure that S\u00e1nchez de Lozada will ever have to face trial. To the contrary, until Thursday, the US has steadfastly refused even to acknowledge Bolivia's extradition request, even though the crimes for which they want to try him are plainly within the scope of the two nations' extradition treaty.</p> <p>Then there's the amazing fact that Democrats, who understandably scorn Mitt Romney for piling up massive personal wealth while he advocates policies harmful to the poor, continue in general to revere these types of Clintonites who, arguably to a lesser extent, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/04/hillaryclinton.uselections2008\">have done the same</a>. Indeed, Democrats spent all last week wildly praising Bill Clinton, who has <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/03/politics/clinton-speaking-fees/index.html\">made close to $100m</a> in speaking fees alone by traveling the globe, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/bill-clinton-brazil-no-1-among-rising-economies-170823632--business.html\">speaking to hedge funds</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/11.29/09-clinton.html\">advocating globalization and free trade</a>.</p> <p>In this case, one finds both the prevailing rules and the prevailing orthodoxies of American justice. High-level leaders in the US government and those who serve their interests are exempt from the rule of law (even when <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/us/28bosch.html?pagewanted=all\">accused of heinous acts of terrorism</a>); only leaders who run afoul of US dictates <a href=\"http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/11/23/noriega-to-be-extradited-to-panama/\">should be held accountable</a>. </p> <p>Even in the civil case against him, an appellate court <a href=\"http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/mamani-v-sanchez\">ultimately ruled</a> that he was immune from damages or civil lawsuits, overturning a lower court ruling that there were sufficient allegations of genocide and war crimes against him to allow the suit to proceed. <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/04/more_federal_judge_abdication/\">As usual</a>, US federal courts are the leaders in ensuring that the most politically well-connected are shielded from the consequences of their acts.</p> <p>Relatedly, we find the prevailing sentiment that asylum is something that is only to be granted by the US and its western allies against unfriendly governments. The notion that one may need asylum <em>from</em> the US or the west \u2013 or that small Latin American countries unfavorable to the US can grant it rather than have it granted against them \u2013 is offensive and perverse to all good and decent western citizens, who know that political persecution is <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/believing-oppression-only-happens.html\">something that happens only far away from them</a>.</p> <p>The protection of this accused former leader will likely generate little controversy in the US because it was the by-product of the actions of both the Bush and Obama administrations, and because it comports so fully with how American justice functions. The only surprising thing would have been if there had been a different outcome.</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: One astute commenter on Twitter, noting the Obama administration's <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/03/06/attorney_general_holder_defends_execution_without_charges/\">claimed right</a> to assassinate even its own citizens without due process or charges, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eTajikistan/status/244876659835146240\">asks</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395907859\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/9/1347219137832/bolivia1.png\" alt=\"bolivia tweet\" width=\"487\" height=\"241\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If the US felt compelled to adhere to the same set of rules it imposes on everyone else, then the obvious answer would be \"yes\". But the point demonstrated by this episode (and countless others) is that the US clearly feels no such compulsion.</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE II [Mon.]</em></strong>: Several people have questioned why \"genocide\" is the appropriate charge for the crimes that occurred here. That is but one of the charges levied by Bolivian prosecutors and courts, and as the <a href=\"http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2011/09/15/the-bolivia-genocide-case-ex-regime-figures-convicted-us-shelters-top-fugitive-53633\">Bolivians seem to recognize</a>, that term has a different meaning under their domestic criminal law than it does under international law. International law professor Kevin Jon Heller <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinjonheller/status/244870849948168194\">yesterday suggested</a> that while \"genocide\" would not apply to these acts under international law, the term \"crimes against humanity\" -- for indiscriminately shooting unarmed protesters -- seems clearly appropriate.</p>",
  "<p>Activist investor Knight Vinke has publicly rejected an improved offer for mining company Xstrata from commodities trader Glencore, which is expected to release further details of its now-hostile \u00a356bn takeover proposal at 7am on Mondaymorning, with a full offer document to follow at a later date.</p> <p>It will be the latest twist in a long-running mega-deal that began as a friendly merger of equals, turned sour over accusations of excessive rewards for management, and has prompted interventions from both the Qatar state and former prime minister Tony Blair.</p> <p>In an announcement to the London Stock Exchange, where both companies are listed, Glencore will flesh out the new terms that its chief executive Ivan Glasenberg put to both his and Xstrata's shareholders in an 11th-hour intervention on Friday.</p> <p>It is understood this will not constitute a firm takeover offer or start the clock ticking on a new deadline in the process. Takeovers must be approved within 60 days of an offer being made, according to UK Takeover Panel rules.</p> <p>The new terms offered by Glencore included an increase in the offer price from 2.8 shares in the new company for each existing Xstrata share to 3.05 shares, and controversially the removal of a promise to make Xstrata boss Mick Davis chief executive of the merged group.</p> <p>In a statement released on Sunday night, Knight Vinke rejected Glencore's improved price, saying \"the value of Xstrata is substantially more than Glencore is proposing today\". The mining company is due to generate a threefold increase in earnings over the next two years, the only one of its peer group to have such a growth profile, argued David Trenchard, vice chairman of Knight Vinke, which is a top 20 Xstrata shareholder with just under 0.7% of the stock.</p> <p>Trenchard also called for a \"substantial increase\" to the price, offered and an \"appropriate premium\" given Glencore's offer has changed from a merger to a takeover, with a corresponding management overhaul, and now represents a change of control at Xstrata. Another Xstrata shareholder, Richard Buxton of fund management group Schroders, has already rejected the terms, saying \"the price is absolutely still too low\".</p> <p>Glencore's new offer came on the day the boards of both companies had gathered in the Swiss town of Zug to vote on the deal, and at the very moment Xstrata's directors were due to take their seats.</p> <p>Xstrata and its key 12% shareholder, the Qatar sovereign wealth fund, are understood to have been surprised by Glencore's stipulation that Davis would no longer lead the merged company as originally proposed. The Qataris are understood to be supportive of the mining group's successful management team.</p> <p>Blair was asked to intervene after it became clear Qatar would lead other Xstrata shareholders in blocking the merger on the grounds that Glencore's offer was too low. In a meeting at Claridge's hotel on Thursday night, Blair is understood to have mediated discussions well into the night between Glasenberg, the Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, and their advisers.</p> <p>The Qataris had in June demanded an offer of at least 3.25 merged company shares for each Xstrata share, but Glencore improved its offer and their stance softened.</p> <p>The new offer of 3.05 shares in the new companyrepresents a 17.6% premium to the miner's share price on 1 February before the merger plans were announced.</p> <p>However, in a statement released from Zug on Friday, Xstrata said the terms also required the replacement of Davis as leader of the merged group and an amendment to \u00a3200m of 'management incentive arrangements' that were due to be paid to more than 70 of the miner's executives in exchange for staying with the new company.</p> <p>In a proposal that irked shareholders at both companies, Davis had been due to receive as much as \u00a375m in retention money, with a further \u00a3144m set aside for his top team.</p>",
  "<p>There is one good reason for Greece to stay in the euro: to combat corruption. It is a sad fact that the country is riddled with it and needs outside pressure and support to sort things out. Athens is not the only place in Europe wrestling with corruption, but we'll come to that later.</p> <p>Even if Greece and its prime minister, Antonis Samaras, could overcome the huge loss of pride and reap some of the economic benefits of quitting the single currency, they would still be left with a corrupt economy, much of which strengthens the power of unions and trade associations.</p> <p>City economists tend to ignore the problem when they assess the pros and cons of euro membership. They have arrived at the collective opinion that leaving the eurozone is the best, if not the only, option for Athens. Central to the argument is that an independent drachma would immediately be devalued, making Greek exports more competitive and at a stroke wiping out many, if not all, of the country's debts.</p> <p>There is also a political dimension that is centre stage at the moment, following proposals for closer union and control from Brussels and, in Greece's case, by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p> <p>Yet these economists ignore the challenges that beset a nation where very few people pay their taxes, where public-sector jobs are secured through family ties and where contracts for work, public or private, are rarely signed without someone in a position of power asking for a backhander.</p> <p>Greek banks are at the centre of the problem, as in Italy and Spain, where bankers perpetuate all the worst corrupt&#xa0;practices.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fe52b940-d59c-11e1-af40-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"\">Martin Sandbu</a>, chief leader writer on economics at the Financial Times, recently chided the southern Europeans for not jumping at the chance to join a European banking union. He argued that the loss of control over a crucial pillar of the economy to a higher EU authority was worth it when set against the chance to end the insidious and corrupt relationship between bankers, politicians and the professional classes, which had so far proved impossible to break.</p> <p>It may seem conspiratorial to argue that corruption is at the heart of the Greek malaise, but it is one of the main reasons Berlin is adamant Athens has had all the help it is going to get, without some evidence the cuts are going through. For German politicians, cuts to sacred state subsidies and increases in tax revenues are a crude indicator that corruption is being tackled, however tentatively.</p> <p>Supporting the view that Greece is beyond helping itself, an <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/09/04/1145251/greek-tax-evasion-mapped-and-crunched/\" title=\"\">in-depth study</a> of how Greek banks, politicians and professional workers behave was published last week by two economists from the Booth school of business at the University of Chicago and a Greek academic based at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.</p> <p>Interestingly, their report, Tax Evasion Across Industries: Soft Credit Evidence From Greece, which documents the hidden, non-taxed economy, blames the current malaise not on dodgy taxi drivers or moonlighting refuse collectors, but on the professional classes.</p> <p>They found that \u20ac28bn (\u00a322.4bn) of tax was evaded in 2009 by self-employed people alone.</p> <p>As GDP that year was \u20ac235bn and the total tax base was just \u20ac98bn, it is clear that this was a significant sum. At a tax rate of 40%, it amounted to almost half the country's budget deficit in 2008, and 31% in 2009.</p> <p>The chief offenders are professionals in medicine, engineering, education, accounting, financial services and law. Among the self-employed documented in the report are accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers.</p> <p>The authors, Adair Morse and Margarita Tsoutsoura from the Booth school of business and Nikolaos Artavanis from Virginia Tech, were given unprecedented access to the records of one of the top 10 Greek banks. They found that, when professionals approached the bank for a loan or mortgage, their tax returns showed their debts almost exceeded their incomes ( debt payments ate up 82% of their incomes). For the beleaguered tax authority, this meant their income was too low to qualify for income tax.</p> <p>On average, they found the true income of self-employed people to be 1.92 times their reported income. Under generally accepted loan criteria, home ownership figure than the UK (80% versus 68%).</p> <p>customers would need to show that their debts, after their mortgage payments were taken into consideration, were less than 30% of their income.</p> <p>Of course, several countries lost control of banking regulation in the runup to the financial crash, including the UK, Ireland and Spain. But it is noticeable that the two countries that have so far done the least about the corrupt relationship between banks and their customers \u2013 Greece and Spain \u2013 are the two countries in the worst trouble.</p> <p>Unlike Ireland, which has exposed a wealth of corrupt practices, Spain continues to hide the extent of its bad loans, especially to property developers who are friends of the bank chiefs who sanctioned their loans.</p> <p>To emphasise the global scale of the problem, the authors point out that World Bank studies show that 52% of corporations worldwide hide some of their income from the tax authorities, and 36% of European companies do so. Corruption is everywhere as companies and individuals seek to preserve their status, incomes and standard of living.</p> <p>Brussels, while enforcing strict rules on Athens, has struggled to contain the rampant corruption that infects its own business and farming subsidies. With that in mind, it may seem a bit rich to lecture the Greeks, but an appreciation of paradox has never been the eurocracy's strong point.</p> <p>The Greeks have begun to crack down on tax evasion. Only this weekend, raids on 11 people found tens of millions of euros' worth of undeclared property and assets in New York, London and various offshore tax havens.</p> <p>The Greek finance ministry's financial crimes unit conducted the raids, and says it has many other groups in its sights.</p> <p>However, broader attempts to crack down on the professions were blocked last year by the Greek parliament. MPs voted against a bill mandating tax audits on people who had incomes below a minimum threshold. The bill targeted 11 professions, including vets, architects, engineers, economists, doctors, lawyers and accountants.</p> <p>The authors found, almost as an aside to their central examination of tax evasion, that the occupations represented in parliament \"are very much those that evade tax, even beyond lawyers\".</p> <p>They said: \"Half of non-lawyer parliamentarians are in the top three tax-evading industries, and nearly a super-majority in the top four evading industries.\"</p>",
  "<p>George Soros is calling on Germany to save the euro, either by abandoning its obsession with austerity policies \u2013 or itself leaving the single currency.\"The difficulty is in convincing Germany that its current policies are leading to a prolonged depression, political and social conflicts, and an eventual break-up not only of the euro but also of the European Union,\" he said in an article published in the New York Review of Books.</p> <p>He warned that the split between creditor and debtor countries in the euro risked becoming permanent, with debtor nations condemned to low growth because they are forced to pay a high premium for access to credit. European union was liable to fall apart under the pressure, he added.</p> <p>Soros singled out Germany as the country that should take responsibility for this \"class divide\" in the eurozone.</p> <p>\"In my judgment, the best course of action is to persuade Germany to choose between becoming a more benevolent leading nation, or leaving the euro. In other words, Germany must lead or leave.\"</p> <p>Soros called on Germany to show leadership by establishing a \"more or less level playing field\" between debtor and creditor countries, and aiming for eurozone growth of up to 5%, \"allowing Europe to grow its way out of excessive indebtedness\". But, he said, \"this would entail a greater degree of inflation than the Bundesbank is likely to approve\".</p> <p>Alternatively, he said, with Germany out of the euro, the currency would depreciate, cutting national debts in real terms and allowing debtor countries to regain competitiveness.</p> <p>IMF director Christine Lagarde yesterday also took a stand against further austerity measures, backing European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi's plan to keep a check on soaring Spanish and Italian borrowing costs, but saying the two nations had already taken enough action to repair their finances to merit aid.</p> <p>Draghi on Thursday announced the ECB was prepared to buy \"unlimited\" bonds to ensure governments had access to funding, but said the action would require a country to ask for a bailout, with tight strings attached.</p> <p>Lagarde said Spain and Italy had already taken \"strong measures\" and their fiscal and reform trajectories were \"adequate in and of themselves\".</p> <p>\"It's a country's decision, in relationship with its member state partners and the institutions of the euro zone, to decide what is best for itself and for the group to which it belongs,\" she told reporters.</p>",
  "<p>Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney said Sunday he will keep some of Barack Obama's controversial healthcare reforms if he wins November's election, breaking from a prior whole-scale rejection of the plan.</p> <p>\"Of course there are a number of things that I like in healthcare reform that I'm going to put in place,\" he said in an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press.</p> <p>Republicans have pledged to repeal \"Obamacare\" \u2013 legislation that has become the focus of a furious backlash from Republicans. Paul Ryan, the party's vice-presidential pick, has described the affordable care act as a \"Ponzi scheme that would make Bernie Madoff proud\". Romney himself has described the legislation as a \"job killer\" that \"puts the federal government between you and your doctor\".</p> <p>But the former Massachusetts governor said Sunday there were a number of pieces of the legislation he would keep if elected, including making sure that people with pre-existing conditions can get insurance. Romney also said he would allow young adults to keep their coverage under their parents' health insurance.</p> <p>\"I say we're going to replace Obamacare. And I'm replacing it with my own plan,\" Romney said. \"And even in Massachusetts when I was governor, our plan there deals with pre-existing conditions and with young people.\"</p> <p>The interview came as it emerged that Obama had received a larger boost than Romney in the polls following their respective conventions. According to Scott Rasmussen's latest poll Obama now leads Romney 49% to 45%, his biggest lead since March 17 and his best approval rating of the year. Obama also has a four-point lead in the most recent Gallup and Reuters/Ipsos polls.</p> <p>Rasmussen said: \"The president's bounce began the night after Bill Clinton spoke to the convention and received rave reviews. Sixty-six percent of voters nationwide have a favourable opinion of the former president. Democrats overwhelmingly believe Clinton and Obama have similar views on how to fix the economy, but few Republicans and unaffiliated voters share that assessment.\"</p> <p>He said the president had made significant gains in voters aged 40-64.</p> <p>The poll Sunday comes even after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/obama-jobs-figures-us-election-chances\">disappointing jobs figures released Friday</a> that showed the US added just 96,000 jobs in August. Obama has spent the weekend defending his record on the economy and attacking Romney's plans. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/08/obama-romney-campaign-battleground-states\">In the swing state of Florida on Saturday</a> Obama summed Romney's platform up as: \"Tax cuts, tax cuts, gut a few regulations, some more tax cuts.\"</p> <p>In an interview aired Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Obama further criticised his opponent for refusing to consider tax increases on America's super-rich as a way to help reduce the deficit.</p> <p>He said:\"You can't reduce the deficit unless you take a balanced approach that says, 'We've got to make government leaner and more efficient, but we've also got to ask people \u2013 like me or governor Romney, who have done better than anybody else over the course of the last decade and whose taxes are just about lower than they've been in the last 50 years \u2013 to do a little bit more.\"</p> <p>Romney attacked Obama's record on the economy on Sunday, stating: \"This does not look like a recovery.\"</p> <p>He also tackled Democratic claims that his tax policies will favour the rich. \"We're not going to have high-income people pay less of the tax burden than they pay today. That's not what's going to happen,\" he said.<br>Romney said he would keep taxes down by closing loopholes but declined to provide an example of a loophole he would close.</p> <p>\"I can tell you that people at the high end, high-income taxpayers, are going to have fewer deductions and exemptions. Those numbers are going to come down. Otherwise they'd get a tax break. And I want to make sure people understand, despite what the Democrats said at their convention, I am not reducing taxes on high-income taxpayers,\" Romney said.</p>",

He described her survival as a miracle, and said it was \"out of the question\" for investigators to interview her until her condition improved. \"We cannot go in a precipitate manner to interview someone who has been injured and traumatised,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"We feel desperately sorry for her [Zainab], and it is terrible that a victim, especially a child, has to be a key witness and has to be asked questions that will inevitably cause her even more suffering. We hope she will be able to tell us something, but it will be difficult.\"</p> <p>Zeena returned to Britain on Sunday after two family members, a British social worker and a police liaison officer travelled to Annecy to collect her.</p> <p>She hid in the rear footwell of the car when the shooting started. The petrified child was saved after taking refuge under her dead mother's legs, where she lay undiscovered for eight hours after gendarmes sealed off the scene, believing there was nobody alive in the car. Zeena has been in the care of a nurse, a child psychologist and has had round-the-clock care from a team from the British embassy. She has been \"gently questioned at length\" by French investigators over the past few days, but was unable to tell them anything. Apart from hearing \"noises and cries\", the public prosecutor said Zeena had seen nothing and was unable to advance the inquiry.</p> <p>\"The most important thing is to get her back to her family,\" he said. \"She has been interviewed, but we have tried to avoid causing her any further suffering.\"</p> <p>The victims were each shot twice in the head with an automatic pistol, suggesting an assassination. French investigators say they are still trying to establish if there was more than one killer and how many weapons were used. Around 25 bullet casings were found in and around the family's car. A source said initial ballistic tests suggested the shots had been fired from outside the vehicle at close range.</p> <p>Maillaud has refused to speculate or give details of DNA found on the bullets or the results of the postmortem examinations, for fear of aiding those responsible for the murders. He said all lines of inquiry are being followed.</p> <p>\"The investigation has to be the priority now. We are not going to release any details or information that might enable the perpetrator or perpetrators of this savage attack to escape. My only aim is to see whoever did this caught and jailed.\"</p> <p>He admitted that hopes of solving the case now rest with Zainab. The position of a child's car seat indicated that the elder girl was travelling in the front passenger seat when the family drove up La Route de Combe d'Ire near the village of Chevaline.Zainab was outside the vehicle, parked at the start of a mountain hiking trail, and was shot in the shoulder and subjected to a violent beating about the head, which fractured her skull.</p> <p>The girl collapsed at the feet of a British cyclist, who arrived shortly after the killings. French investigators praised his \"exemplary\" reaction in placing the critically injured child in the recovery position and calling the emergency services.</p> <p>The Briton, a former RAF pilot, who has a house in the region, was also profoundly shocked to discover the body of a French cyclist nearby. Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old father-of-three, had overtaken him on the hill leading to the beauty spot just moments before. Mollier, who police said appeared to have been \"in the wrong place at the wrong time\", was gunned down after apparently witnessing the bloodshed.</p> <p>Zainab has been under police protection in intensive care at Grenoble university hospital since Wednesday and has undergone operations. Doctors said her life was no longer in danger, but they had put her into a medically induced coma to help her recovery.</p> <p>On Sunday, detectives were going through the holiday caravan the family had stayed in since 3 September, which had been removed from Le Solitaire du Lac campsite on the banks of Lake Annecy on Saturday. French investigators are also looking at the contents of a laptop found in the caravan and two mobile phones found in the Hillis' BMW estate car. They are also communicating with police forces in Italy and Switzerland, where the killer or killers may have fled.</p> <p>Police continued to search the Hillis' Surrey home and contacted Swedish authorities to confirm the identity of the 77-year-old woman, who had a Swedish passport.</p>",
  "<p>Northampton confirmed the pecking order and the clean sheet they have over Exeter at Franklin's Gardens but they made hard work of it, needing tries from the new boy Luther Burrell and their captain, the England hooker Dylan Hartley, to see them to a bonus-point victory.</p> <p>Even then Matt Jess managed to find a way through the Northampton defence in the final minute to set nerves jangling for one final time, enough for the Exeter coach, Rob Baxter, to say it was his side's best performance here. \"We're moving forward and, if we keep learning, then one day we'll come here and turn a half-time lead into a win,\" said Baxter.</p> <p>\"It's by far our best performance here. We were competitive against a good side. We're getting closer.\" He even suggested the omens were good for Exeter to jump over Northampton in the title race.</p> <p>However, life would have been a lot harder for Exeter had Northampton, through Ryan Lamb and Stephen Myler, not missed five kicks and the easiest of drop goals, but then again Ignacio Mieres, normally the model of consistency, was off song for Exeter as well, nine kicks being missed on a day which looked perfect for the kickers.</p> <p>Given that Baxter's assistant, Ali Hepher, a Northampton old boy with 120 Saints games under his belt, had been saying all week that trips to Franklin's Gardens are a yardstick by which the Devonians must judge themselves, the first half would have been grim viewing, the first half-hour of it at least.</p> <p>Northampton's pack took control in the scrum and then shunted the Exeter lineout back 20 yards and then 20 yards again. Out wider England's full-back and occasional wing, Ben Foden, had the chance to put the younger Pisi brother Ken in, but his radar was on the blink and the full-back looked generally out of sorts until Mieres tried a high clearance.</p> <p>Foden took the catch five yards inside his own half and made another 30 before the Russian wing, Vasily Artemyev, got to within touching distance of the Exeter line. However, Christian Day was inside and Northampton seemed on a roll.</p> <p>Lamb missed the conversion and an earlier penalty, going left then right, but made amends with the break that set up the second try. Day was on hand again, Pisi Jr switched from right to left and, when Artemyev ran out of space this time, he found Phil Dowson outside him and the score was 10-0, 12-0 with Lamb's conversion.</p> <p>Exeter were finding it hard to put anything together but the Samoan wing Josh Tatupu, as he had done in last week's six-try victory over Sale, proved that nimble footwork can unlock most defences. He stepped inside Artemyev and then Phil Dollman stepped inside again to go under the posts.</p> <p>Mieres, who some think could soon be playing for Argentina, pushed a couple of earlier penalty misses to the back of his mind, added the conversion and then a couple of rapid penalties \u2013 the second after the referee, JP Doyle, had looked long and hard at the replay \u2013 and suddenly from being seriously on the back foot, Exeter were a point to the good and Northampton's new boy, Gerrit-Jan van Velze, was in the sin bin for a tip tackle on Will Chudley.</p> <p>Another Mieres penalty pushed the lead to four points but Myler replaced Lamb, the giant league convert Burrell was just too strong for the Exeter midfield and Hartley burst off the back of a 63rd-minute lineout to earn the acclaim of his director of rugby, Jim Mallinder. \"He's world class,\" said Mallinder. \"He stands out in everything he does. He doesn't have a sloppy session.\"</p> <p><strong>Northampton</strong> Foden; K Pisi, G Pisi (Burrell, 35), Waldouck, Artemyev; Lamb (Myler, 50), Dickson; Tonga'uiha (Waller, 67), Hartley (Haywood, 74), Mujati (Mercey, 63), Manoa, Day (Sorenson, 31), Dowson, Wood, Van Velze (Oakley, 61).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Day, Dowson, Burrell, Hartley <strong>Cons</strong> Lamb, Myler.</p> <p><strong>Sin bin </strong>Van Velze 38, Oakley 78.</p> <p><strong>Exeter</strong> Arscott; Tatupu (Naqelevuki 49), Whitten, Dollman, Jess; Mieres (Steenson, 76), Chudley (Barrett, 61); Sturgess (Moon, 63), Whitehead (Alcott, 65), Mitchell (Budgen, 77), Hayes, Muldowney (Hanks, 31), Johnson, Scaysbrook, Baxter (Phillips, 58).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Dollman, Jess <strong>Con </strong>Mieres<strong> Pens </strong>Mieres 3.</p> <p><strong>Attendance</strong> 12,230 <strong>Referee</strong> JP Doyle (RFU).</p>",
  "<p>My friend Stuart Le Pla, who has died of cancer aged 67, dedicated his life as a lawyer to public service rather than private practice, first as an articled clerk in Reading, then as a solicitor in Huddersfield and Kirklees, West Yorkshire, and ultimately, for more than 20 years, at Rochdale metropolitan borough council.</p> <p>In Rochdale, he put his belief in empowering ordinary citizens into practice. By the end of his time there he was the council's assistant chief executive with responsibility for community partnerships.</p> <p>The way Stuart lived his life reflected his liberal and democratic ideals. He was proud that his unusual surname could be traced back to the French Huguenots \u2013 people who stood up to persecution and oppression. Stuart was born in Chapeltown, Sheffield, son of Frederick, an engineer who had played rugby for Saracens, and his wife Winifred. Stuart and I were at school together, first in Sheffield, then at St Peter's, York, before Stuart went on to the London School of Economics to read law and then qualified as a solicitor.</p> <p>In the mid-1970s in Huddersfield, Stuart was instrumental in setting up a free legal advice service in the evenings for the Citizens' Advice Bureau, persuading other local solicitors to join him. After his retirement in 2001 he was appointed a non-executive director of Huddersfield Central primary care trust. He was a great believer in the NHS, but he distrusted the concentration on targets and internal markets, preferring always to put people as individuals first.</p> <p>Stuart was keen on many sports, especially swimming and rowing, had an eclectic taste in music which ranged from Tom Lehrer and Bob Marley to Bach and Elgar, and loved fast cars, particularly the MGA sports car which he owned for over 40 years.</p> <p>Before anything else, though, came his family \u2013 his wife Auriel, whom he married in 1968, and who cared for him at home to the end, their son Nathaniel, daughter Jessica and three granddaughters. They all survive him.</p>",
  "<p>So here's Shame! - a study of sex addiction in New York played for laughs, rather than lament. It's from the hand of Stuart Blumberg, who milked artificial insemination for lols with his script for The Kids are All Right, and now takes on directing duties for the first time, too. This film shares Kids' leading man, Mark Ruffalo, as well as its cocktail of first world tears and tickles. But the notes come through with heavier punch in this one: it's just as gluggable, but the aftertaste is less subtle. Sometimes it fizzes, at others - particularly a late scene involving a peripheral character's overdose - it curdles.</p> <p>Ruffalo is a eco-friendly businessman five years sober (no sex, even with himself) after a period of energetic indulgence. He attends an addicts group where his mentor is Tim Robbins, who's dabbled in booze and violence, as well as OTT nookie, but now seems reformed and still happily married to childhood sweetheart Joely Richardson (underused). Ruffalo himself has a mentee: Josh Gad's slobby doctor, who spends his days covertly filming up his boss's skirt and his nights chowing and wanking (it's testimony to Gad how sympathetic he still seems). Pink plays another troubled romper who makes Gad her first non-fuck buddy.</p> <p>Blumberg's screenplay is nothing if not structurally waterlight. Each lead's arc bisects neatly with the other; each character's sub-story chimes with appropriate counterpoint. Thus Robbins's son has returned home from a spell as a junkie, Ruffalo is tentatively dating Gwyneth Paltrow, who has food control issues, and Gad needs to tell mum Carol Kane to cut the apron strings before she emasculates him entirely.</p> <p>Shame was erotic compulsion turned into opera, full of sombre vibrato. Thanks for Sharing is probably the more realistic, as well as more mainstream, and there's a generous pinch of very funny lines, mostly bestowed on Robbins. But the tutti fruit of its predecessor does make it seem all the more vanilla.</p>",
  "<p>Almost 50,000 people living in care homes will next week be asked to rate their experience, in the first sign of a new approach to the way health and social care is monitored after a collapse of confidence in the system based on a single watchdog.</p> <p>The move by a group of leading care home chains to commission the independent survey is being backed by the watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, which says it points to a future system in which other agencies must share responsibility for demonstrating the safety and quality of care services.</p> <p>The commission says it will take firm action where there is evidence of services failing, and it is likely to order more inspections of hospitals and care homes that do not show verified evidence of their performance. But it says it cannot run the same intensity of checks at the more than 40,000 sites where care is offered.</p> <p>David Behan, the CQC's new chief executive, said: \"How we regulate a small, three-bed home for people with autism, how we regulate a dental practice and how we regulate a multisite, multimillion-pound teaching hospital needs to be different.\"</p> <p>His comments, in an interview with the Guardian, will be seen to mark a new chapter in the CQC's short but troubled history. The resignation last Friday of its chair, Dame Jo Williams, turned the page on the organisation's first phase, in which controversy dogged its creation in 2009 and its work as a super-regulator.</p> <p>Williams is expected still to join Behan on Tuesday in facing questioning by MPs on the Commons health select committee. But her announcement, following the departure this year of Behan's predecessor, Cynthia Bower, will have drawn much of the sting from what was likely to have been a tempestuous hearing.</p> <p>Next week's care home survey will be carried out by the polling firm Ipsos Mori and will cover 850 homes run by 13 operators including Anchor, Barchester Healthcare, Care UK and HC-One, which acquired more than 240 homes from the failed Southern Cross group.</p> <p>Residents and their families will be asked to rate factors including staff, activities, privacy, security and food and to say whether they are happy at their home and whether they would recommend it. Results will be published early next year and the exercise will be repeated next September, potentially involving many more of the 400,000 people in care homes.</p> <p>The scheme has been initiated under the banner \"Your Care Rating\" by operators brought together last year by Castleoak Group, a specialist construction company for the care sector, at a summit supported by the Guardian. Douglas Quinn, Castleoak chairman, said: \"It will help those looking for a care home to make an informed decision based on residents' real experiences. A great deal of care has been taken in the design and piloting of the survey to make sure that it is accessible to as many residents as possible.\"</p> <p>Behan said he had not seen any detail of the survey but the idea was exactly the kind of initiative needed from care providers in a system in which standards were driven up by the actions of agencies of all kinds and by the voices of service users.</p> <p>The CQC would want to verify the survey and be satisfied on its independence, he said. \"But if this innovation comes off and it begins to work, and these providers begin to develop a reputation for quality, then more and more people across the system are going to start following their lead and we will need to develop the way that we work in accordance with that.</p> <p>\"But what the public expects us to do is give an independent check on whether these services are providing quality and safety. So it doesn't remove the need for us to arrive at a judgment and to publish the outcome of that in a way that is clear and accessible.\"</p> <p>The CQC has opened a three-month consultation on how it will operate in the period to 2016. Behan acknowledged past failings and promised there would be change. \"We have just been through a period in which this organisation has been scrutinised probably more than any other in the public services for a good many years,\" he said. \"One of the hallmarks of a high-performing organisation, which is what I intend us to be, is that it listens to what people are saying about it, it considers that \u2013 and then it acts.\"</p>",
  "<p>Without any fanfare, the Care Quality Commission last week began registering 8,500 GP practices in the last leg of its marathon undertaking to regulate all state and private health and social care across England. The scale of the challenge has almost broken the organisation, but its new chief executive is determined to make sense of what many observers have seen as an impossible remit.</p> <p>It is likely to produce a way of working very different from a traditional regulatory model of routine and uniform inspections which, says David Behan, would be impractical even within the CQC's \u00a3153m budget, given the size of the task and the way that health and social care is becoming much more devolved and diverse.</p> <p>The organisation is seeking views on an approach based on different levels of regulation and partnership with other agencies. But it is already looking as far afield as Australia in search of other models with which it plans, in Behan's words, to \"experiment\".</p> <p>The commission has brought in Kieran Walshe, professor of health policy and management at Manchester Business School, to advise on these other models. He is working with Martin Marshall, a CQC board member and professor of healthcare improvement at University College London, in a partnership that should allay anxieties at least about the calibre of the research.</p> <p>Behan is adamant that differential regulation will not mean going easy. \"This is not soft touch; this is appropriate touch,\" he said. \"We will regulate everywhere and we will inspect unannounced. But in drawing up this consultation, we have asked people \u2013 and we have talked to 700 people \u2014 if we can have the same approach to a single-handed dental practice and to a teaching hospital, and they have said no, they don't think we can.\"</p> <p>A social worker by background, Behan, 56, joined the commission in July from the Department of Health, where he was director general of social care. Previously, he was chief inspector of the Commission for Social Care Inspection, one of three regulators that were merged to form the CQC.</p> <p>He appeared surprised by the resignation last Friday of Dame Jo Williams, CQC chair, and there is no suggestion of differences between them. \"Since I took up the post, Dame Jo and I have formed an effective partnership to develop and launch the proposals for a fresh strategic direction for the organisation,\" Behan said.</p> <p>Williams was acutely embarrassed by former health secretary Andrew Lansley's rejection of her request to sack Kay Sheldon, a CQC board member who has been the most prominent of several internal critics of the running of the commission and of a culture that has been described as secretive and bullying. Behan said he did \"acknowledge those factors\" and was aiming to create a more open culture. But he wanted to see the organisation signed up to a single purpose and vision. \"We can't have different views about why we exist and what we are here to do,\" he said. \"Clearly, we have had large differences in the past, and that's going to be difficult for some people.\"</p> <p>Thanks to an extra \u00a310m funding this year from the health department, the CQC is almost up to its full complement of inspectors for the first time. Some 115 recent recruits are waiting to start and 55 more are being sought, which would take the total to 955.</p> <p>Ministers want to see the department's \u00a360m grant shrink and the commission earning more of its income from registration fees. But, as Behan knows, that will depend crucially on his plans succeeding and confidence being won back.</p>",
  "<p>Hong Kong voters have gone to the polls in greater numbers than ever, after days of political drama in which students on hunger strike forced the government to drop an unpopular education policy extolling the merits of mainland China.</p> <p>The elections are for 70 seats in the legislative council, under rules that ensure a pro-government majority. The former British colony, under mainland Chinese sovereignty since 1997, is guaranteed freedom of speech and assembly but can only vote directly for just over half the seats available in the council.</p> <p>Three issues topped voters' concerns: the rising cost of buying a home, resentment towards mainland Chinese arrivals in the city, and a policy known as national education.</p> <p>This last brought tens of thousands of people, led by the school activist group Scholarism, to the government headquarters each night for the last two weeks. Posters read \"Love is learned\", with the first letter of learned crossed out. Drawings of a brain held in two hands were labelled: \"Do not wash \u2013 handle with care.\"</p> <p>\"From the moral or ethical perspective this programme does not do any good for Hong Kong society and I cannot see any economical benefits other than pleasing the Chinese government,\" said Taylor Li, a 21-year-old university law student who was one of a small number of people on hunger strike.</p> <p>He criticised the planned course for \"only praising China's spacecraft, its high-speed railway, its Olympics\". The syllabus makes no mention of 4 June 1989, when Chinese tanks moved on student protests in Tiananmen Square.</p> <p>Agnes Chow, 15, said she knew better than to love China blindly. \"When I look at the curriculum document, I think national education is really controlling the mind of children, so I joined Scholarism,\" she said.</p> <p>Hong Kong's chief executive, CY Leung, cancelled a planned visit to Vladivostok for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit, and on Thursday announced that two future apartment buildings would be reserved for Hong Kong rather than mainland buyers. Some believe mainland property speculation is to blame for high Hong Kong property prices.</p> <p>On Friday, Leung announced that a plan to allow more than four million mainlanders in neighbouring Shenzhen to apply for visas to visit Hong Kong would be indefinitely delayed. And after dark on Saturday he buckled on national education.</p> <p>Analysts described it as the rise of identity politics: Hong Kong people were different from their mainland neighbours and wanted to stay that way. The slogan of one of the leading pro-democracy political parties, the Civic party, was \"Say no to a red Hong Kong\".</p> <p>With the older Democratic party, the Labour party and the more radical People Power, Civic's main goal is universal suffrage in Hong Kong. Their better financed opponents \u2013 and the natural allies of Beijing \u2013 are the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) and the Federation of Trade Unions.</p> <p>If Leung was hoping his last-minute climbdowns would spur support for the pro-China bloc, he could be disappointed. \"They want to develop the sense of us to become really Chinese. But the more they want to enforce this subject, the more we want to pull back and not to follow what they want,\" said Chris Yung as she left a polling booth.</p> <p>The balance of power in the new legislature depends on highly complex vote-counting rules. The stakes are high: incoming representatives have the task of agreeing to or rejecting Beijing's need to act on its promise of further democratisation in the next five years.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who knows me knows of my hatred of 'scary novels'. However, my recent love of dystopia stories forced me into trying new book, 'Slated'. Chilling, haunting and spine-tingling, it's not one for the faint-hearted or easily scared. Although it terrified me out of my right mind, it is one of the most brilliant, mind-blowing, clever books I have ever read. </p> <p>'Slated' is set in a very scary future. Anyone under the age of 16 is made to undergo a surgery if they are believed to be 'terrorists', or if they are believed to be threats to the society. Their minds and memories are completely wiped and drawn blank. They have no idea who they ever were, and are given an amazing 'second shot' at life. This procedure is called being 'Slated'.</p> <p>Enter the character of Kyla. She's confused about all the terrifying flashbacks that keep returning to her - like the man who keeps returning to her dream, smashing her fingers with bricks. And yet, the only answer she is given is that she's \"different\". Then, enter the complications of Ben - sweet, funny and likes Kyla for who she is. Can Kyla find out who she is, who she was, and who she needs to be?</p> <p>With complications, grips, twists, turns and secrets, it's not only Kyla who feels uncomfortable in her world. As a reader, you are given the experience of never knowing where you're at, there's no better way to keep a reader engaged. We're involved and absorbed in the plot at all time, making us feel just as disturbed as Kyla. Exhilarating and fast paced, it goes without saying how fantastically the book is written, and whatever Terry's ambition in writing 'Slated', she has utterly succeeded.</p> <p>As a character, Kyla is one of the strongest I have read about in YA literature. It's so hard to portray a character whose personality is wiped blank, and yet Terry has managed to show the transition subtly and with complete ease - apart from the point that Jessica of 'Booked Up' made about the fact that if Kyla had been stuck in a hospital for 9 months, she would have known how to open a door. Tiny errors like that didn't annoy me though, and I only really thought about them when reading Jessica's review. </p> <p>Kyla really comes through and, excuse the cliche, springs off the page. Her innocence, and despair, but also how incredibly intense she is made Kyla so interesting - both as a character and to read about. I wouldn't go quite so far as to say you could completely relate to her, because she's not that kind of character, however, Kyla does sort of become a friend, and when reading a book in the first person, this can often be the case. Through the first person format, we can connect with Kyla, and the story being written in the present tense also allows us to be there in the moment of action, and to understand the complex plot easily. </p> <p>Slated certainly has plenty of bite. I won't lie and say I wasn't annoyed at the end since I hate cliffhangers. Cliffhangers are always a very clever trick, but agonising for someone like me who wants to know what happens next. <br>I'd say the best way to read 'Slated' is in small chunks, in order to savour every last bit. It's so gripping that you end up reading much more than you want to, and then it's finished - disappointing, not because of the plot, but because you're so desperate to know what happens next.</p> <p>I felt Kyla's pain throughout the whole book - it got better, than worse for her, and then better. And then worse. Her strength, emotionally, physically and as a character shone through for me and continued to grow with every chapter. </p> <p>The only negative comment I have about the book is about the character of Kyla's 'sister', Amy. I don't think her personality was as strong as the other characters, and it wasn't kept up throughout the book. Amy is a completely different person at the beginning of the book to at the end of the book, and it confused me - there was nothing stated that showed her transition. At the beginning, Amy was sincere, thoughtful and supportive towards Kyla, but at the end, she couldn't care less, and she's rude - I didn't see that happening, anywhere at all. Amy just fades into the background as your average, boring character, which is a real shame, as I thought if she had been built up, she could have made an immense difference to the book, and instead it was her boyfriend Jazz who took the star part.</p> <p>I won't dwell too much on Ben, because I think that's the loveliest part of the book, Kyla and Ben's connection grows throughout the book, so I didn't want to spoil that. </p> <p>I don't think 'Slated' has been publicised, emphasised or spoken about nearly enough - it's the best book I've read all year, and I honestly admire Terry, her motives, and 'Slated' as a book. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.</p> <p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site </a>and send us your review!</strong></p>",
