  "<p>The crowd came more in hope than expectation. Or maybe they came because they liked the idea of titanium wheelchairs crashing into each other at speed or they had heard that the North Greenwich Arena turned into a provincial nightclub between matches and breaks in play (\"It's fun to stay at the Y-M-C-A\"). In any event 6,000 raucous spectators were left disappointed but magnificently entertained as Britain's women were dramatically beaten 55-44 by Germany in the quarter-finals of the wheelchair basketball.</p> <p>Granted, it does not look that close. And the records will show the British team lost four matches out of five at the Paralympics (with the small print that the quarter-final selection was made from 10 teams). They were thrashed by Holland and Australia in the group stages and faced a public laceration from their coach, Garry Peel, who branded them \"an absolute disgrace\".</p> <p>But the British women were far from disgraceful on Tuesday night. With five minutes to play in the final quarter, they led Germany, unbeaten in the tournament so far, 41-38. They looked set to pull off one of the biggest upsets in wheelchair basketball history. Victory would have been a shock not quite on a par with the defeat of Oscar Pistorius but it might have resulted in an inquiry into whether the Britons had boosted the height of their wheelchairs beyond the regulation 21 inches off the floor.</p> <p>Afterwards Sarah Grady, the 28-year-old British guard, was asked if the better team had won. \"I don't think that,\" she replied. \"We were the better team, it's just that some of our shots didn't drop.\" It was an outrageous claim to make in the circumstances but she might just have had a point.</p> <p>The British women had been improving with each game but there had been no hint they were capable of such a sustained effort. From the tip-off they harried, hassled and intimidated a German team ranked second in the world.</p> <p>Before this match Germany had been insouciantly draining half the shots they took; in the first half they were barely netting one in four. Their star player Gesche Sch\u00fcnemann, completely ineffective, was reduced to watching from the bench.</p> <p>Sweat was the key to the British effort. They were manoeuvring their chairs faster (12.6kph compared with 11.9kph) and tyre-squeaking around more of the court than the Germans. They were let down a little by the accuracy of their shooting \u2013 a recurring problem in the Paralympics \u2013 but defensively they were outstanding.</p> <p>No one epitomised this resolve more than 22-year-old Helen Freeman, who played every second of the 40 minutes. From Watford, she was the youngest player in the team in Beijing and now studies at the University of Illinois. She went there to become one of the best wheelchair basketball players in the world and, with 19 points on Tuesday night, she is looking well set to achieve her aim.</p> <p>Germany will play Holland in the semi-finals while the British, who looked distraught as they left the arena to a standing ovation, are left to fight for fifth place. It will be little consolation but already it is tempting to think of Rio. Alongside Freeman, there is 19-year-old power forward Amy Conroy and tenacious 20-year-old guard Laurie Williams. The nucleus of the side is well set for 2016.</p>",
  "<p>Second time around David Weir made winning gold look even easier. He needed a sprint finish to win the 5,000m title on Sunday but he had pretty much wrapped up the 1500m gold by the time the bell rang to signal the final lap. Weir had been running in second throughout, holding his line in lane two to try to stop anyone overtaking him.</p> <p>With 350m to go he moved up into first. Such is his speed and strength no one was going to pass him. With the crowd roaring him on, he crossed the line in 3min 12.09sec, ahead of Thailand's Prawat Wahoram and South Korea's Kim Gyu-dae.</p> <p>The gold paint celebrating his 5,000m win was still drying on the postbox in his home town of Wallington. Weir has set himself a Sisyphean schedule at these Games. Each day he wakes and has to start rolling his wheels around the track again, in pursuit of another gold.</p> <p>He will be back at the stadium on Wednesday morning, taking to the start line for the 800m having had only a few hours' sleep to recover from the night's exertions. It beggars belief that after all that he will end his Games, on Sunday, by trying to win the marathon title too. \"I am glad I have got two days to rest before that,\" he said drily. The man is a phenomenon. No wonder his team-mates have come up with a special song, reworking Warren Zevon's old hit Werewolves of London in his tribute.</p> <p>The victory means that Weir is now 2-0 up in the fierce three-way rivalry at the top of the most competitive class in Paralympic track and field, T54 wheelchair racing. The two men he is duelling with did not even feature. Switzerland's Marcel Hug, who holds all four world records at 800m, 1500m, 5,000m and 10,000m, was fourth. And Australia's Kurt Fearnley, who has nine Paralympic medals, was seventh.</p> <p>In this form Weir will be favourite to beat them both and win the 800m title too. He says it will be a tactical affair but reckons he can win it whichever way they race it. \"I felt so relaxed today, I wasn't bouncing off the walls ready to race. I saved a lot of energy. I was very calm in warm-up and I did a few quicker laps in warm-up, and I just thought, 'I have got loads in the tank.' My speed was so good at the moment. I thought I went a little bit too early but all the endurance and speed work I have done in the last 12 weeks showed in that finish.\" The 1500m, he said, has always been the blue riband event, the one he has wanted to win ever since he first saw it being raced at Barcelona in 1992.</p> <p>The truth is, though, that Weir does not seem to favour one race over any other. He just wants to win everything. \"I haven't just come here to win on the track, I have come to win on the road as well.\" The battle with Fearnley on Sunday could be the most special race of all.</p> <p>Fearnley has the edge. He has raced 43 marathons, won 31 of them and been on the podium for another 10. But then Weir has won the London Marathon six times and beat Hug by a single second in the 2012 race.</p> <p>Fearnley has preferred to concentrate his energies on preparing for these Games. But he has won the last two Paralympic marathons. In Athens in 2004 he took gold despite the fact that his wheelchair got a puncture 5km from the finish. He just ran on his rims for the rest of the race. He is as tough as they come.</p> <p>In 2009 Fearnley climbed the 1,504 steps of Sydney Tower on his hands.</p> <p>He took them two at a time, and finished in a little under 20 minutes.</p> <p>Two months later he dragged himself over the Kokoda Trail through the mountains of Papua New Guinea. It took him 10 days. It takes most people 12 to do it on foot. On the flight back to Australia the airline he was using forced him to check in his wheelchair and tried to get him to use one of their own as a replacement. Offended, he refused, and crawled through the airport on his hands. The backlash caused the airline to revise its disability policies completely.</p> <p>Weir and Hug are just as uncompromising in their own ways. Weir's impairment has never stopped him doing what he wanted to do. All three were born with their impairments. Hug, who goes by the nickname of the Silver Bullet, has spina bifida. Fearnley has lumbar sacral agenesis and was born without the lower portion of his spine. Weir was born with a spinal cord transection. It is, in each case, one of the least remarkable things about them.</p> <p>None sees his disability as something he has had to overcome, or struggle with, none wants to be admired for the mere fact that he has had to cope with his impairment.</p> <p>Hug says that his major frustration in life is \"being admired as disabled person and not respected as sportsman\". Each of them just wants to be known as the best at what they do. But for any one of them to do that, he will need to beat the other two and right now neither Fearnley nor Hug looks capable of beating the Weirwolf.</p>",
  "<p>The loan drought which has prevented the UK's struggling small business sector from investing in new equipment and employing new staff has become more acute, according to a new report.</p> <p>Small businesses said they had lost confidence in lenders following a squeeze on credit that prevented them getting loans and overdrafts.</p> <p>BDRC Continental's quarterly SME Finance Monitor found that only 43% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) used external finance compared with 51% just three months earlier. A third of businesses that applied for loans and a fifth of those that applied for overdrafts were turned down, said the report.</p> <p>Confidence among firms that banks would sanction a future overdraft fell to a new low, with 39% confident of success compared with 52% in the first quarter, said BDRC Continental.</p> <p>More company owners were found to be using their own savings to fund investment or cover shortfalls in cashflow.</p> <p>The tightening of the screw on small businesses by banks reluctant to lend is a headache for George Osborne, who has made lending to small businesses a key Treasury objective. The chancellor has sanctioned several initiatives to spur lending, but they are either limited in scope or have yet to gain any momentum.</p> <p>Ministers know that SMEs are more likely to increase employment, compared with large businesses, when they can gain funding for investment in equipment and processes.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said bank credit was vital for a healthy SME sector and growth in the economy.</p> <p>\"The bottom line for the economy is that no more banking equals no more growth. It's as simple as that,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The message we must take from this devastating demolition of banks' lies that they are lending to small businesses is this: 'It's time we used the stick on the banks we own and nationalise RBS instead of force feeding them carrots.'\"</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce said the SME Finance Monitor figures showed there are still serious obstacles for many companies seeking external finance.</p> <p>\"The figures strengthen the case for the creation of a British Business Bank, which would help address some of the problems in business lending,\" it said.</p> <p>The report found that most businesses believe the poor state of the economy, employment legislation and the reluctance of big companies to pay their bills on time were bigger barriers to growth than a lack of bank lending, though all four areas were of vital importance to expansion.</p> <p>The EEF, which represents manufacturing companies, said it was concerned that SMEs were turning their back on bank finance.</p> <p>Chief economist Lee Hopley, said: \"UK banks need to be doing all they can to encourage creditworthy firms back through their doors. They can start by delivering on their commitments, such as consistently offering the declined loans appeals process and signposting service. So far awareness of these initiatives by relevant SMEs is running woefully low.\"</p>",

Police believed he was part of an armed gang who were about to attempt a drugs heist.</p> <p>On Tuesday night video footage of the incident recorded by one officer was released by the inquiry, despite the objections of the Metropolitan police.</p> <p>Audio captures one officer saying \"sweet as\" three times, followed by what appear to be the dull thuds of police gunshots ringing out across a surburban street. The video does not capture the actual shooting.</p> <p>Rodney, 24, was shot without an armed officer shouting an oral warning, the inquiry has been told.</p> <p>The inquiry heard from Rodney's mother, Susan Alexander, who believes her son was \"summarily killed\".</p> <p>In a statement during which she broke down, Alexander contrasted her son's death seven years ago to the fate of two other men in the car, Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, who were later convicted of firearms offences. Alexander said: \"To state the obvious they were at least able to walk away alive on 30 April, and have long since served their prison sentences, while it seems to be that Azelle was executed that day and as a result never got to see his baby daughter.\"</p> <p>Her barrister, Leslie Thomas, said that his client's case accepted that Rodney was not wholly innocent: \"We do not seek to justify what Azelle was doing on the day he died. Nor do we seek to portray him as an angel. But he was entitled to be apprehended, if there was evidence he was entitled to be charged.</p> <p>\"He was entitled to be brought before a court of law to face a trial before a jury of his peers and if convicted, rightly and properly punished with the deprivation of his liberty.</p> <p>\"The fact that he was strongly suspected of being involved in criminal wrongdoing does not justify him or anyone else being summarily killed.\"</p> <p>The intelligence in the Rodney case was passed to the Met by Customs. It is understood to have been developed through intercepts. Police believe it suggested that a gang would stage an armed heist against Colombian drug pushers on the streets of London, and steal their class A drugs.</p> <p>Samantha Leek QC, barrister for the firearms officer who killed Rodney, known as E7, said: \"He believed that Mr Rodney had picked up and was preparing to shoot a fully automatic weapon, and he fired at Mr Rodney until he believed that there was no longer a threat. He fully understands that Mr Rodney's family hold him responsible for Mr Rodney's death. He believed that he had no alternative but to fire.\"</p> <p>The Rodney case was one of the reasons that the last Labour government and then the current Conservative-led coalition considered introducing so called \"secret inquests\".</p> <p>An investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) exonerated the police, and the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was no criminal case for police to answer.</p>",
  "<p>Yorkshire clocked up another Games gold when Danielle Brown defended the Paralympic archery title she won in Beijing by shooting to victory in the women's individual compound final. The law graduate required her last arrow to see off the challenge from her British team-mate Mel Clarke, who won silver in a tense final at the Royal Artillery Barracks.</p> <p>Brown's victory follows golds in Beijing four years ago and in Delhi two years ago, where she made history as the first disabled athlete to represent \u2013 and win a medal for \u2013 England in an able-bodied event at the Commonwealth Games.</p> <p>Celebrating her gold, Brown, who is from Steeton, West Yorkshire, admitted to nerves in the earlier rounds due to \"crazy\" pressure in the build-up to her title defence in her home country.</p> <p>\"I've been really feeling it [the pressure] the last couple of weeks, so to actually come here and manage to keep my head in the right place, I'm chuffed to bits about that,\" she said. \"It's been crazy. I didn't think it would have affected me the way it has. My whole family and friends were out there watching me. It was just incredible \u2013 I was shaking so much.\"</p> <p>Brown, whose sister Georgina is an able-bodied archer, took up the sport aged 15, four years after she was diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, a neurological condition that causes her severe burning pains in her feet. Despite the chronic pain she refuses to use a wheelchair.</p> <p>Brown, 24, wearing her distinctive pink hat, and the 30-year-old Clarke could not be separated in the final's first set, which they scored 27-27. They were then tied at 29-29 in the second before Brown took a 4-2 lead by shooting three arrows of nine. Clarke took the fourth set 29-26 to level at 4-4 and force a fifth set.</p> <p>Norwich-born Clarke, who took up the sport after a try-out day with the girl guides 14 years ago, was left needing a maximum 10 score on her final arrow to send the contest to a tie-break. She had shot five 10s in the final but under such pressure could shoot only a seven, her worst arrow of the final.</p> <p>Brown said she was relieved to be shooting first, leaving Clarke to \"play catch-up\" and the pair made light of any rivalry after their gold-silver double, which repeats the success of the Paralympic archers in Beijing, where the team won four medals, second only to China.</p> <p>Clarke, who was forced to reinvent her shooting style nine years ago after Lyme disease caused her to lose sight in her aiming eye, described her silver as \"unreal\". \"If I was going to get beaten in the Paralympics final, there's nobody I'd rather get beaten by than Danielle,\" she said. \"I don't regard it as competing against Mel,\" said Brown. \"I just compete against myself and that way I can concentrate more.\" She said she was relieved she was shooting first. \"That helps a lot. My arrows had all gone and she had to play catch-up, as it were.\"</p> <p>Brown, who will celebrate her triumph with her parents on Tuesday night, said she had no intention of forging a career in law but would instead focus on winning her third successive Paralympic gold in 2016.</p> <p>\"I definitely want to go to Rio. I don't want to go back into law, archery's way more fun,\" she said. \"The more tournaments I go to, the more experience I get and the better I get.\"</p> <p>Although Brown said she enjoyed Paralympic competitions more than able-bodied events because \"it's much more friendly\", she vowed to continue to aim for as many competitions as possible. Unfortunately she will not be able to compete at the Commonwealth Games in 2014 because archery is not in the programme in Glasgow.</p>",
  "<p>The websites of the Arabic news network, Al-Jazeera, were hacked on Tuesday, apparently by a group sympathetic to the Syrian regime.</p> <p>Al-Jazeera's English and Arabic websites were affected by the hack, made by a group calling itself al-Rashedon, or \"the guided ones\".</p> <p>\"This is a response to your position against the people and government of Syria, especially your support of the armed terrorist groups and spreading false fabricated news,\" the group said in a statement blanketing <a href=\"http://aljazeera.net/\">aljazeera.net</a>. \"Your website has been hacked, and this is our response to you.\"</p> <p>In a statement, the network said its external services had been \"compromised\". It added: \"The company that operates them quickly resolved this, though some users may continue to experience issues for a while longer. We thank our online community for their patience and support.\"</p> <p>Commentators said they were not familiar with the group that claimed responsibility. \"I have not heard of this group before,\" wrote Ahmed Al Omran, a Saudi journalist and blogger, in an email to the Guardian. \"Previous attacks of similar nature have been claimed by the Syrian electronic army.\"</p> <p>Aaron Zellin of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a thinktank based in Washington DC, said: \"I think the hackers were just trying to make a statement and get their voices heard. It will get them attention, if just for a few days.\" Zellin said there were suggestions that the hackers may be a cyber arm of the Shabiha militia loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, but that such a connection was difficult to prove. </p> <p>Since the start of the Arab spring, al-Jazeera has made a name for itself as one of the leading news organizations covering the region's instability. Unlike some other state-controlled media, al-Jazeera has been known for aggressive coverage of dictators and oppressive regimes. But it has also been accused of inconsistency and bias.</p> <p>A number of staff <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/03/arab-spring-arab-tv-credibility\">resigned from al-Jazeera earlier this year</a>, accusing it of being biased against the Syrian regime but in favor of Bahrain, a Gulf state neighbor of Qatar, where the network is based.</p> <p>Al-Jazeera is funded by the Qatari government; critics say it follows its sponsor's foreign policy objectives, although the broadcaster says it is independent of government control.</p> <p>\"Over the past year al-Jazeera has become more sectarian and more biased in what they cover and what they don't cover,\" said Zellin. \"They don't cover issues that don't fit the Qatari foreign policy narrative.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 September 2012 to correct the spelling of the name of the Saudi journalist Ahmed Al Omran.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Once there was a plan to get the Tories back into government without those nasty Lib Dems. It was a clear plan, arrived at after much research. The man responsible, Lord Ashcroft, strategist and Tory moneybags, was very proud of it. You need to pick up more minority votes, he said. \"The party must understand the anxieties and aspirations of people from these backgrounds \u2013 and that many do not believe Tory principles extend to the concern for others that are an essential part of their own religious and cultural identity,\" he said <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9234157/Lord-Ashcroft-Conservative-party-must-disprove-fears-that-it-only-looks-after-its-own.html\" title=\"\">in the Sunday Telegraph</a>. \"Otherwise, it will continue to be seen as a party of middle-class white people which talks only to other middle-class white people.\" Some, looking at the stats, took this to heart, especially the modernisers in central office. So that was broadly the plan, more minorities, more women, more attention to the north. So where are we after yesterday's reshuffle? Down goes Baroness Warsi, demoted and reasonably so perhaps \u2013 but deposed as the figurehead of the Ashcroft approach and not replaced. Up goes Jeremy Hunt, the white male MP for South West Surrey, and Chris Grayling, the white male member for Epsom and Ewell; and up, up goes Grant Shapps, the white male MP for Welwyn Hatfield. Welcome back David Laws, the Tory's favourite Lib Dem, and honourable white male member for Yeovil. Once there was a plan. Now there is another plan that means no ethnic minority member of the cabinet. Poor Lord Ashcroft; and that isn't a sentence that trips off the tongue. What a waste of time and money.</p> <p>\u2022 Some women did benefit. Theresa May stayed put at the Home Office, and Justine Greening, having made clear her opposition to Heathrow expansion, will be jetting out from there every other week as international development secretary. And what about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jun/10/hugh-muir-diary-david-mellor\" title=\"\">Maria Miller</a>, Jeremy Hunt's replacement as culture secretary, responsible for the media? Just last year, we spent thousands giving her and the other rookie ministers basic media training to stop them messing up on the telly. A fast learner? We'll see.</p> <p>\u2022 The fact that education secretary Michael Gove held on to his job ensures that the PM will not have another restless and potentially dangerous soul to deal with on the backbenches. It also allows the favourite of the Tory right to push on with his free schools revolution; perhaps resuscitating some of the proposals that foundered in the first wave. By far the most imaginative of these must have been the <a href=\"http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Hull-MP-Chuckle-Brothers-Commons-debate/story-15847450-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">school that would have opened in Rotherham</a> under the supervision of a Tory-inclined teacher and one half of the northern comic duo, the Chuckle Brothers. The initiative foundered because the driving force backed out citing personal circumstances. Which was a shame for Gove, because he was behind the venture. \"The fact someone who is strong in the variety world wanted to back it is, to my mind, only proof that increasingly when people look at this government, from whatever background they come, they have a smile on their face as they consider our achievements,\" he said. The person most likely to smile in this context is surely Ed Miliband.</p> <p>\u2022 Ordinarily Grahame Morris, the Labour MP for Easington in the north-east, would smile too. But not today. He has, what one might call \"a situation\". It can't be easy, as the principled leader of Labour Left, to contend with <a href=\"http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9906351.MP_in__red_neck__row/\" title=\"\">Twitter trolls denouncing him as a misogynist and a \"redneck\"</a>. All because of his namesake Grahame Morris, a strategist with the Australian Labor party. Our Grahame Morris embodies the long tradition of working class political struggle. Their Grahame Morris called a female journalist a \"cow\" and suggested opponents of Australian prime minister Julia Gillard really \"ought to be kicking her to death\". Our Grahame might well struggle in Oz. They certainly wouldn't stand for the Aussie Grahame in Easington.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, he survived the reshuffle, but it's tough being chancellor of the exchequer these days. Why, colleagues are asking, did 80,000 people boo George Osborne on his visit to the Paralympics this week? Because that's the capacity of the stadium.</p> <p><em> Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The much-anticipated insider account of the Navy Seal raid that killed Osama bin Laden hit bookstores in the US on Tuesday, having already knocked this year's publishing leviathan Fifty Shades of Grey off its bestseller perch.</p> <p>Sales of the unauthorised memoir, No Easy Day, went ahead despite a Pentagon threat of legal action against its author for alleged violation of non-disclosure agreements.</p> <p>Before the Pentagon's warning last week, publisher Dutton brought the release date forward from 11 September, saying it was important to let the book speak for itself.</p> <p>On Tuesday the Pentagon said that after reviewing the book, it believed that it contains classified information. Rear Admiral Sean Pybus, who heads the Naval Special Warfare Command, said it could also provide enemies of the US with insight into their operations.</p> <p>He told his force in a letter quoted by the Associated Press that \"hawking details about a Seal mission\" and selling other details of Seal training and operations puts the force and their families at risk.</p> <p>\"For an elite force that should be humble and disciplined for life, we are certainly not appearing to be so,\" Pybus wrote in a letter to the 8,000 troops under his command. \"We owe our chain of command much better than this.\"</p> <p>At the Pentagon, press secretary George Little said an official review of the book determined that it reveals what he called \"sensitive and classified\" information, but he would not give details about which passages in the book were considered to be a violation of the non-disclosure agreements signed by Mark Bissonette, the real name of the Navy Seal who wrote the account under the pseudonym Mark Owen.</p> <p>Fox News identified Bissonette, 36, as the author of the memoir after Penguin announced the book last month and his identity was confirmed by military sources.</p> <p>In a letter addressed to \"Mark Owen\", Charles Johnson, the defence department general counsel, alleged the writer violated secrecy agreements and broke federal law. \"In the judgment of the Department of Defense, you are in material breach and violation of the nondisclosure agreements you signed. Further public dissemination of your book will aggravate your breach and violation of your agreements,\" Johnson wrote.</p> <p>Bissonnette's lawyer, Robert Luskin, disputed this, saying he believes the decorated former Seal has \"earned the right to tell his story.\"</p> <p>Luskin's <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/104540365/Owen-Johnson-Lt-r\">letter in response</a> said the author \"sought legal advice about his responsibilities before agreeing to publish his book and scrupulously reviewed the work to ensure that it did not disclose any material that would breach his agreements or put his former comrades at risk\".</p> <p>The controversy does not appear to have hurt sales of the memoir. Presales of the book at Amazon overtook the record-breaking erotic trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey, while an initial print run of 200,000 has been increased to 575,000 copies, according to <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/53798-navy-seal-s-lawyers-respond-to-pentagon-s-threat.html\">Publishers Weekly</a>.</p> <p>The book reveals details of the raid that differ form the official version of events and raises questions as to whether Bin Laden <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/navy-seal-bin-laden-raid\">could have been taken alive</a> .</p> <p>According to the author, Bin Laden was shot not at point-blank range in a bedroom but from a distance in a hallway as he peered around his bedroom door. He was unarmed and it was later discovered that weapons around the bed were not loaded, which Bissonette cites as being a mark of dishonour. \"There is no honor in sending people to die for something you won't even fight for yourself,\" he writes in the book.</p> <p>Bissonnette said he was behind the \"point man,\" or lead commando, as the Seals followed Bin Laden into the room. They discovered him on the floor at the foot of his bed with \"blood and brains spilled out of the side of his skull\", and two women wailing over \"still twitching and convulsing\" body.</p> <p>The official version of events is that the lead commando missed and the Seals confronted Bin Laden in his bedroom in the May 2011 raid, killing him with one shot to the chest and another in the left eye.</p> <p>Military officials have said that the Seals made split-second decisions, fearing that he could have been wearing a suicide vest, but critics have argued that despite being labelled a \"kill or capture\" mission, there was virtually no chance he would be brought back alive.</p>",
  "<p>Considering Heather Frederiksen's sideline as a qualified driving instructor, it is small wonder her speciality is reverse. Having promised to \"give it a right good go\" after qualifying fastest, the 27-year-old defending champion burst into tears after doing exactly that last night on her way to winning the Paralympic S8 100m backstroke title.</p> <p>It was her second medal of these Games and a step up the podium from the S8 400m freestyle silver that caused a similar outpour of emotion last week. Steering a gun-barrel straight course up and down her lane to finish in 1min 17.00sec, Frederiksen finished just under two seconds ahead of the USA's Jessica Long, with Russia's Olesya Vladykina back in&#xa0;third.</p> <p>Despite clocking in at a slower time than she posted four years ago in Beijing, this was an admirable triumph for an athlete whose preparations in the build-up to these Games were badly hampered by several lengthy spells in hospital prompted by a series of excruciating migraines. \"Obviously through the lack of training I've had through illness, I knew I just had to go out there strong and then try to hang on,\" she said afterwards. \"I had a funny feeling the girls were catching me down the last 25 or 15 because the crowd were getting louder but I just had to keep pushing and pushing and get to that wall.\"</p> <p>Frederiksen's victory provided her with a welcome opportunity to step into the Aquatics Centre limelight hitherto hogged by Ellie Simmonds, whose quest to depart from these Games sporting more gold around her neck than Mr T hit a snag when she found two swimmers too good for her in the S6 50m freestyle. However, despite tasting defeat for the first time in these Games, the double gold medal winner was far from downbeat and admitted she had not expected to feature in this particular shake-up.</p> <p>\"That was my weakest event and to be on that podium when I wasn't expecting it is brilliant and hopefully my coach is going to be really chuffed,\" Simmonds said. \"This puts me in really good stead going into the 100m freestyle on Saturday.\" Her effort here was typically heroic but the diminutive swimmer's apparent one-woman crusade to make a nonsense of the hoary old saw that a good big 'un will always beat a good little 'un came unstuck in a race that was simply too short to facilitate one of her trademark late victory surges. Given another 10 or 15 metres she might well have reeled in Mirjam de Koning-Peper and Victoria Arlen, the first two home.</p> <p>Having seen team ParalympicsGB arrive mob-handed for the evening's entertainment, with 15 swimmers contesting assorted finals across the board, a capacity partisan crowd did not have to wait long to roar a favourite on to the podium. In the men's S8 100m backstroke, Ollie Hynd led home a British three-four-five of himself, Thomas Young and Sean Fraser behind the white-hot Russian favourite Konstantin Lisenkov and his compatriot Denis Tarasov.</p> <p>On a night when Paralympic and world records were being smashed like like drum kits at a Keith Moon tribute night, Swansea's Stephanie Millward swam a European best time in winning her second silver of these Games, finishing runner-up to South Africa's defending champion and runaway winner Natalie du Toit in the women's S9 400m freestyle. Elsewhere China's Xu Quing, Australia's Brendan Hall, Belarus's Ihar Boki, USA's Justin Zook, Russia's Oxana Savchenko and Canada's Summer Mortimer helped add to the gaiety of a heartwarming number of different nations by swimming faster in their particular disciplines than any disabled athlete in the world before.</p> <p>On another night of home success not every British face was a happy one. Already a dual medal winner at these Games, the 16-year-old Surrey schoolgirl Hannah Russell finished well down the field in the S12 100m freestyle won by the world record-breaking Savchenko. Meanwhile in the S7 50m freestyle, Susannah Rodgers was edged out of contention and into that wince-inducing Olympic and Paralympic netherworld of fourth.</p> <p>Towards the end of a night punctuated by enough medal presentation ceremonies to tire even the most self-congratulatory South American despot, Matt Walker was the final British athlete to trouble the presentation party, making his way on to the podium clutching a photograph of his late father. The 34-year-old veteran from Stockport finished third in the S7 50m freestyle to maintain his record of having won at least one medal at each of his Games appearances since Sydney 2000.</p>",
  "<p>Whether the European single currency survives its existential crisis (and the betting on that must be yes, more or less), the larger project of bringing the continent closer together has been fatally damaged.</p> <p>That much was admitted by the European Central Bank last month in a bulletin titled <a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/is120802_media_request.en.pdf\" title=\"\">Indicators of Market Segmentation</a>, which found that lending across borders within the eurozone has fallen from 60% of money-market flows last summer to 40% this February. Foreigners held about 45% of all Spanish government debt in 2009; now the figure is closer to 30%. What was one continent \u2013 at least in financial terms and for over a decade at that \u2013 is swiftly coming apart.</p> <p>But the Great Break-Up goes further and deeper than that: not only are European nations coming unstuck from each other, they are also breaking into regions. Clear evidence is visible in Spain this week, with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19465277\" title=\"\">Andaluc\u00eda becoming the fourth province in the country</a> to ask Madrid for a cash rescue, after Valencia, Murcia and Catalonia. In part, this is about regions unable to bear the fiscal discipline that northern Europe has imposed on Madrid and that prime minister Mariano Rajoy is now trying to whip 17 semi-autonomous regional governments into following. There is political capital for Andaluc\u00eda's Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gri\u00f1\u00e1n \u2013 president of Spain's only Socialist region \u2013 in opposing Mr Rajoy's cuts, which is why <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-01/andalusia-challenges-spain-debt-caps-meant-to-deepen-budget-cuts\" title=\"\">he is challenging the federal budget in court</a>.</p> <p>But Madrid knows that if it resists the appeals for emergency funds then any disruption or closure of schools and hospitals (which are under control of the regions) will be blamed squarely on the capital. Hence the swift response from Mr Rajoy to set up an \u20ac18bn emergency pot to pay out to stricken regions. The prime minister's liabilities are unlikely to stop there \u2013 not with Spain's recession deepening and cutting tax revenues. The big risk for Mr Rajoy is therefore that he will not be able to deliver the austerity he has promised northern Europe, and will see his budget projections blown out of the water \u2013 even while his voters blame him for imposing unnecessary economic pain.</p> <p>Just like Italy, Spain is now paying the price for not using the long boom to build sustainable economies in its poorer regions. But it is not alone in that vice; Britain did the same, and it is very likely that Westminster faces more conflict with councils in the north and national governments in Scotland and Wales.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron shifted the political gravity of his government firmly to the right in a substantial government reshuffle that left Nick Clegg weakened and raised the prospect of a series of fresh coalition disputes over crime, the environment and business-friendly policies.</p> <p>In the only serious setback for Cameron and his closest ally George Osborne, Iain Duncan Smith insisted on staying at work and pensions secretary, so raising the prospect of a battle as the Treasury demands a second round of big welfare cuts next year to bring the deficit-reduction programme back under control.</p> <p>Heavy-handed Treasury briefing on Monday night prompted Duncan Smith to reject the offer of succeeding Kenneth Clarke as justice secretary.</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the tough employment minister, has instead been handed the role and will use the portfolio to challenge European judicial interference in British government decisions.</p> <p>A senior Tory minister said: \"Overall this is a serious lurch to the right.\"</p> <p>Downing Street itself billed the reshuffle, the only major recasting of government planned ahead of the 2015 election, as an attempt to promote ministers capable of delivering on policies already announced. In a symbol of the commitment to delivery, Cameron has appointed Locog chief executive, Paul Deighton, as Treasury minister based in the Lords to deliver infrastructure.</p> <p>Although No 10 said the reshuffle did not mean any change in coalition policy, a string of appointments signalled otherwise. Cameron demoted Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, after the debacle over health reforms in the past year, but surprised many by asking Jeremy Hunt to take up the portfolio.</p> <p>Hunt has been under relentless Labour attack over his role in News Corporation's attempted takeover of BSkyB, but is rated by Cameron for his ability to focus on a clear political message. His first task will be to resell and amend Lansley's legacy, aided by Grant Shapps, the smooth-talking new Conservative chairman.</p> <p>The removal of Justine Greening as transport secretary, a fierce opponent of a third runway at Heathrow, and her replacement by the former chief whip Patrick McLoughlin also paves the way for a government shift on aviation expansion, probably though a cross-party commission on aviation policy.</p> <p>In a blunt assessment even by Boris Johnson's standards, the London mayor denounced Greening's transfer to international development as madness. He issued a blistering statement praising Greening as \"a first-rate transport secretary\".</p> <p>\"Now it is clear that the government wants to ditch promises and send yet more planes over central London,\" he said.</p> <p>Theresa Villiers, another London MP opposed to the third runway, has also been shipped out of the transport department to take charge of Northern Ireland, a promotion of a woman to cabinet in a reshuffle that overall did little to advance the cause of women in politics.</p> <p>Grayling's appointment also signals a determination by Cameron to take a tougher line on sentencing, the Human Rights Act, legal aid and community punishment, a nexus of policy issues that has left Conservative backbenchers frustrated by what they regarded as Clarke's willingness to pander to Lib Dem opinion.</p> <p>Axing Clarke from the post removes a running sore for the Sun, Telegraph and Mail, even if he remains as a minister without portfolio free to advise on economic policy. It is a move Osborne will view with mixed feelings. Clarke, who rejected an offer to become leader of the Commons, has ensured that he will sit on the key cabinet sub-committee on the economy and on the national security council.</p> <p>One former Labour cabinet minister said: \"This reshuffle represents both Plan A \u2013 Osborne remains as chancellor \u2013 and Plan B \u2013 Ken Clarke as deputy chancellor.\"</p> <p>In practice Clarke has been a deficit hawk, and Tory pro-growth policies will be promoted by Michael Fallon at business, Nicholas Boles at planning and Mark Prisk as housing. But Tory MPs said Osborne had failed to extend his grip over Whitehall in every area. The biggest setback was the refusal of Duncan Smith to relinquish the post of work and pensions secretary, where he has been involved in a series of battles over his welfare reforms.</p> <p>The chancellor was keen to move Duncan Smith because he is fighting a public battle to resist Osborne's plans for a further \u00a310bn in welfare cuts by 2016. Duncan Smith's success raises the prospect of a renewal of his alliance with Nick Clegg, who provided vital support over the funding of his welfare reforms. The deputy prime minister told the Guardian last week that he would only accept some of the extra welfare cuts in return for a wealth tax.</p> <p>But Osborne will see some of his allies in key posts. Michael Fallon, a member of his circle, and Matt Hancock, his former chief of staff, move to the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills.</p> <p>Downing Street avoided a major setback when Lady Warsi reluctantly accepted a demotion from Tory co-chair to be \"senior minister of state\" at the foreign office.</p> <p>Warsi had planned to refuse the new job after being informed by the prime minister on Monday that she was being demoted. This would have raised questions about Cameron's focus on promoting members of Britain's minority ethnic communities. But in the end Warsi decided to remain on board, after Cameron told her she would remain a key member of the government.</p> <p>Only three cabinet ministers were fired altogether from the government\u2013 Caroline Spelman, Cheryl Gillan, and Sir George Young. Cameron appointed four women from the class of 2010. Liz Truss, one of the most influential thinkers of the new intake, becomes an education minister. Helen Grant, who played a key role in negotiating changes to the legal aid bill to answer concerns among women's groups about domestic violence, becomes a justice minister. Anna Soubry and Esther McVey come in to the health and work and pensions departments respectively.</p> <p>In a move designed to focus Liberal Democrat resources on election-winning domestic issues, Clegg appointed allies David Laws to education, Jeremy Browne to the Home Office and Norman Lamb to health. The Lib Dems vacated both the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence, a move that shocked Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat armed forces minister who had used his base to shape a distinctive policy on Trident.</p>",
  "<p>The organisation that will take control of the Olympic Park when the gates close for the final time on Sunday has vowed to invest \u00a32m in a range of Paralympic legacy projects including a festival of disabled sport.</p> <p>The announcement came as ParalympicsGB continued their run of medals on Tuesday with successes in the pool, in the archery at Woolwich and the equestrian events at Greenwich Park.</p> <p>Sophie Christiansen became Britain's first triple gold medallist of the Paralympic Games. Christiansen, riding her horse Janeiro 6, added Grade Ia freestyle gold to a team gold medal and individual championship title. The 24-year-old, from Maidenhead in Berkshire, who has cerebral palsy, also secured a British Paralympic record 11 medals in one Games for the equestrian team.</p> <p>Heather Frederiksen, who was told in 2004 she would never swim again after a serious accident, retained the gold medal she won in Beijing in the 100m backstroke S8.</p> <p>Frederiksen, who competed internationally as an open water swimmer before the accident that left her with limited use of her right arm and leg, had only been able to train for six weeks after spending time in hospital in March being treated for neuralgic migraines.</p> <p>Ellie Simmonds, 17, added a bronze to the two golds she had already won. She said she was pleased with a bronze in her weakest of four events and will target a hat-trick of golds in the 100m freestyle S6. There was also a silver medal in the pool for Stephanie Millward in the women's 400m freestyle S9 and a bronze for Oliver Hynd in the men's 100m backstroke S8.</p> <p>As the medals poured in, attention began to turn to how to ensure the optimism and interest generated by the Paralympics, which has sold out to 2.5m ticketholders and attracted record television audiences, left a meaningful legacy.</p> <p>The London Legacy Development Corporation \u2013 the City Hall vehicle with responsibility for what will become the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and the venues on it \u2013 said it would try to develop disabled sport at grassroots and elite level in east London.</p> <p>Under the \u00a32m programme, the corporation also said it would ensure all the sports facilities and housing on the park was fully accessible.</p> <p>The Copper Box, which hosted handball during the Olympics and goalball during the Paralympics, will be used for wheelchair rugby, boccia, wheelchair basketball and goalball when the park reopens. The LLDC will ensure agreements to provide provision for the sports are written into the contracts of the operators of the venues.</p> <p>The LLDC, which has found permanent tenants for seven of the eight permanent venues on the park, but must still finalise the future of the main stadium, said the annual festival of disability sport would have links to programmes in the surrounding boroughs to encourage grassroots sport.</p> <p>\"The Paralympics have captured our hearts and minds and the success of ParalympicsGB provides us with new heroes to emulate,\" said London's mayor Boris Johnson.</p> <p>\"With the Olympic Park set to become London's newest neighbourhood, today's announcement shows how the new facilities, training and job opportunities, and sports events will be accessible and open to everyone long after the Games have left town.\"</p> <p>But despite the promises, there are fears that constrained local authorities across the country will be less able to invest in ensuring that sports facilities are accessible to all.</p> <p>The north end of the Olympic Park will reopen on 27 July 2013, one year after the Olympic opening ceremony, and the south part that contains the stadium and has more of an urban feel will reopen in spring 2014.</p> <p>In the Paralympics archery Danielle Brown, who won a team gold medal for England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, won gold in the individual compound final. In a contest that went down to the wire she beat her compatriot Mel Clarke, who won silver.</p> <p>Brown has complex regional pain syndrome in her feet, which she contracted at 11 and leaves her in almost constant agony. She has said the intensity required for elite archery helps to control the pain.</p> <p>Nigel Murray, Britain's most successful boccia player, ensured he would end his final Paralympics with a medal after the mixed BC1-2 team secured bronze at the ExCel.</p> <p>At In Greenwich, Sophie Wells riding Pinocchio took silver in the freestyle test Grade IV equestrian final. And Matthew Skelhon took bronze in the mixed R6-50m rifle prone SH1 shooting final.</p> <p>But there was disappointment for one of Britain's best known Paralympians. However, wheelchair tennis player Peter Norfolk, the \"quadfather\", who has won gold in the singles at the last two Games and carried the union flag in the opening ceremony, suffered a shock defeat to Israel's Shraga Weinberg.</p> <p>And Great Britain's blind football five-a-side team were disappointed to go out of the competition in the group stage after losing 1-0 to Iran.</p>",

Few opportunities emerged for her great-great-grandmother, given to a life of work before she was 10 years old after being orphaned. On her mother's side, however, fortunes were rather different: her grandfather William Ferguson was a gamekeeper at Balmoral who once danced with the Queen Mother. But a rather scandalous case of illegitimacy preceded such salubriousness. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>Mrs Biggs</strong></h2> <p>9pm, ITV1</p> <p>Sheridan Smith plays the innocent young Charmian who, in 1957, meets the cocky, older Ronnie Biggs on a train and falls for his puckish twinkle. Daniel Mays is the young swaggerer who dresses in a suit for his commute, even though he works as a lowly carpenter. Adrian Scarborough is magnificent as Charmian's austere father and Smith further proves her chops as the helplessly-in-love ingenue. But the script feels a bit route-one, spoken by actors who are capable of so much more. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2><strong>Dallas</strong></h2> <p>9pm, Channel 5</p> <p>In the 80s, it was illegal not to watch the oil-rich family's fights every week \u2013 and now they're back.

They've now added a glossy new generation with John Ross (Josh Henderson) and little Christopher (Jesse Metcalfe) all grown up and following their dads' bitter rivalry. The young 'uns are sexy, champagne-slugging and covered in oil, thanks to the first drill on Southfork. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2><strong>Top Dog Model</strong></h2> <p>8pm, ITV2</p> <p>Rather disappointingly, this is not, as the title suggests, a competition to find the nation's most beautiful prisoner, but a search for a new canine supermodel. The X Factor-style judging panel is led by reality TV staple Stacey Solomon, which should give a fair indication of the quality of this show. David Walliams provides the innuendo-laced voiceover as primped pooches parade before the judges, who make incisive comments such as: \"Oh, he's so selling that sailor outfit to me!\" You'll need an unwavering love of dogs and talent shows to get through this one. <em>HV</em></p> <h2><strong>Storyville: The $750m Thief</strong></h2> <p>9pm, BBC4</p> <p>Marc Dreier was a New York lawyer who assembled his seemingly successful business empire and extravagant lifestyle by stealing from clients and financial institutions. After pleading guilty, and while awaiting sentencing, he is placed under house arrest for 60 days, which is where his ex-employee Marc H Simon interviews him about his misdeeds. The resulting film is intriguing; Dreier is frank about his crimes and the way the fraud spiralled out of control, though it's hard to sympathise with a wealthy, vainglorious man who saw himself as entitled to his dream lifestyle. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2><strong>Awkward</strong></h2> <p>9pm, MTV</p> <p>Series one of Awkward was a smart, sharp high-school comedy with a Mean Girls/Easy A splash of darkness.

  "<p>The prime minister promised at the weekend that his reshaped cabinet would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/david-cameron-cut-through-dither\" title=\"\">\"cut through the dither\"</a> impeding Britain's recovery. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/04/cameron-reshuffle-government-politics-live\" title=\"\">reshuffle</a>, he implied, would send a thunderclap of authority echoing across the land.</p> <p>So what happened? David Cameron decided that he would not move any of those responsible for the supposed dither. He would not change the chancellor, George Osborne, or the vice-ditherers, Vince Cable and Danny Alexander. Indeed he would encourage them to more dither. There would be a sixth, or is it a seventh, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/13/bank-of-england-new-lending-scheme\" title=\"\">attempt to get banks to lend to businesses</a>. There would be a third, or is it a fourth, attempt to change the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/george-osborne-deregulation-planning-laws?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">planning laws</a>. Cameron would sack his least dithering ministers \u2013 Kenneth Clarke, Andrew Lansley and Justine Greening \u2013 and promote his least emphatic, Jeremy Hunt. That would show them.</p> <p>Cabinet reshuffles are politically surreal. They honour the thesis that British ministers are repertory actors, a troupe able to mug up any script on the night. All that matters is to keep the audience happy. To be a minister needs no executive experience or training, merely a vaguely plausible manner. The civil service will run the country, and nowadays also take the blame if anything goes wrong.</p> <p>We were told Cameron understood this and intended to change it. No serious organisation plays musical chairs with its top executives every year or so, just for the sake of appearances. To this extent he deserves credit for keeping so many ministers, including all the senior ones, in post. It is only when we look at the changes he has made \u2013 and not made \u2013 that the message becomes blurred. Reshuffles may not mean much outside the Westminster village, but they are good indicators of the political weather.</p> <p>Cameron has clearly punished ministers for having their own minds, at least when they are outside his personal circle. Clarke's departure from justice is a sad loss of one of the few ministers to engage seriously with his brief and push through real reform. Chris Grayling is a solid enough successor, but he must be able to see the lesson. Politicians who seek to remedy Britain's dire record on penal reform will get no support from Downing Street.</p> <p>Likewise Cameron backed Lansley in his NHS radicalism and has now ditched him. Whether Hunt has the grasp to stick with, or unpick, Lansley's reform must be doubtful. Either way, it looks like dither. As for ditching Greening at transport, it indicates a return to more dither in this ever vexed policy area. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport#Secretary_of_State_for_Transport_.282002.E2.80.93_.29\" title=\"\">Eight transport ministers in 10 years</a> says all we need know about \"getting Britain moving\".</p> <p>The big-government centralists have survived: Theresa May at the Home Office, Michael Gove at education and Eric Pickles at local government. A clutter of \"non-portfolio\" ministers, so familiar under Tony Blair, is spreading across Downing Street, with Francis Maude, Oliver Letwin, Kenneth Clarke and, apparently, David Laws supposedly \"co-ordinating\" something or other. This is a recipe for more dither.</p> <p>To prepare for the reshuffle, Cameron and Osborne went out of their way to show themselves aware that economic policy is in a deep rut. The coalition's 2010 strategy had failed to avert double-dip recession and something new was needed. Yet, given their rejection of Keynesian monetary expansion, the two men were bereft of anything novel to say. This was glaring in their weekend performances, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2196870/DAVID-CAMERON-Hard-work-moral-good-dumbing--It-time-stop-dithering-thats-holding-Britain-back.html\" title=\"\">Cameron in the Mail on Sunday</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19455195\" title=\"\">Osborne for the BBC</a>.</p> <p>Both implied that the failure of policy was not their fault. We should look to foreign markets, the eurozone, bankers, planners and Osborne's derided \"communities\". This was nimby politics, the blame always directed to some other backyard. Regulation was everywhere too tight, despite Maude spending two and a half years supposedly curbing it.</p> <p>Cameron and Osborne offered just two drearily familiar remedies: yet another attempt to boost bank lending, and yet another attempt to weaken planning control. If more bank lending were the answer to <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/city-news/1-in-7-shops-are-empty-on-our-high-1301251\" title=\"\">one in seven high street shops now standing empty</a> \u2013 after a third of a trillion pounds had supposedly been \"injected into the economy\" \u2013 Britain would be booming. It is not. As for a few more acres of green belt given over to executive homes, it is absurd to suppose this might give a short-term boost to the economy.</p> <p>The real message of the reshuffle is that only one relationship matters in this government. It is not between Cameron and his Liberal Democrat coalition deputy, Nick Clegg \u2013 a shotgun marriage now painful for both parties. The key relationship is between Cameron and Osborne.</p> <p>Such closeness between prime minister and chancellor is a real asset to most governments, as can be seen when it so often breaks down. But to be fruitful it needs creative political tension, not just a friendly symbiosis. And of the two, the prime minister must be in the lead.</p> <p>The impression today is the reverse. Osborne has the stubbornness of a Treasury traditionalist. There is not a Keynesian bone in the body, and he is alarmingly susceptible to the Bank of England and the banking lobby. In this he is reminiscent of Labour's crisis chancellors, <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/REsnowden.htm\" title=\"\">Philip Snowden</a>, <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUcripps.htm\" title=\"\">Stafford Cripps</a> and, more recently, Alistair Darling. All lacked minds of their own.</p> <p>Cameron for his part has not shown the intellectual rigour to challenge the Osborne/Treasury dogma. He can wail about dithering, but he is the ditherer. He has dithered on taxation and banking reform. He has dithered on penal policy, localism and planning. In his reshuffle he has appeared to dither on the NHS and transport. He does not appear the dominant partner in the government because he has not manifestly seized control of economic strategy. Indeed he has just appointed Clarke, an ex-chancellor and worsted justice secretary, to roam free round Downing Street with a licence to \"give advice\". This is an accident in waiting.</p> <p>Osborne is coming to seem more and more like Gordon Brown to Cameron's Tony Blair. Cameron is known to admire Blair, who in 1999 wailed about \"bearing the scars on my back\" from the opponents of change. Then as now, Britain had an inexperienced prime minister, who dithered between when to change course and when to stand firm. True, Cameron and Osborne are plainly bosom friends. But then so were Blair and Brown, until the going got tough. When the going got tough, no one could tell which was in charge. From then on all was collapse.</p>",

As the boos rang out, Osborne feigned an unconvincing sporting smile for the cameras. But in an age where facial appearances count for much in politics, it isn't merely his unconvincing smiles that present a serious handicap (along with his policies, of course). It's the unfortunate sneer he so often wears, a disastrous characteristic for a chancellor from a privileged background presiding over the toughest economic era of modern times.</p> <p>Despite those Paralympic jeers and opinion polls spelling out the credibility deficit, Osborne was one man who knew he was never in line for reshuffling. The ex-PR man in David Cameron must know that the chancellor is the biggest single handicap to the Tories winning a 2015 election and that reshuffling him would have been worth several points in the opinion polls, but friendship, or whatever, cocoons Osborne. It will become Cameron's political suicide note.

Gove's free-school programme will perhaps deliver 20,000. It is also costly and, in some cases, wasteful.

  "<p>Squash 'em! That was the advice I was given on finding a little colony of cabbage white butterfly caterpillars. Many gardeners struggling against weather and weeds to maintain an aesthetic or productivity will be moved to violence when faced with the indolence of \"pests\" freeloading off their lovingly tended plants. There is a kind of moral indignation about wild Nature wriggling out of control and nibbling the precious produce as if it's a premeditated crime.</p> <p>Even now those attitudes jump the garden fence and inflict themselves on the environment. In this case the caterpillars were feeding on garlic mustard, a cabbage relative and therefore the prerogative of cabbage whites. The caterpillars had recently hatched from a cluster of eggs. Bristly, green and yellow like little commuter trains, their shear-like jaws chomped succulent leaf, leaving only a skeleton of veins as if the plant had been zapped by some alien death ray. The caterpillars worked together quickly, efficiently. They seemed so vulnerable \u2013 and slightly frantic, as if they had to get as much food&#xa0;into the wrinkly sleeping bags of their skins before being eaten themselves, or squashed.</p> <p>All this, just to grow, then pupate, then fly away as a butterfly to lay its own eggs. There's a lot about the idea of metamorphosis that we accept on faith. The difference between those gobbling grubs and the paper-white flutterers they will become is astonishing. Perhaps caterpillars and butterflies look so different because they are? That was the fascinating view of biologist Donald Williamson, whose evolutionary theory of hybridogenesis considered butterfly metamorphosis to be a result of larval transfer between velvet worms \u2013 the caterpillars and insects \u2013 and butterflies. Like many good ideas and things that don't fit in, that was squashed too.</p>",
  "<p>George Monbiot, like other self-righteous anti-war zealots, seizes on Desmond Tutu's refusal to share a platform with Tony Blair to once again demand the prosecution of the former prime minister for alleged war crimes (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/03/tony-blair-the-hague-iraq-war\" title=\"\">We're one crucial step closer to seeing Blair at The Hague</a>, 4 September). His case hangs on the detail of various UN resolutions which, like most such resolutions, are barely worth the paper they are written on, primarily because so much national self-interest affects the way members vote.</p> <p>Iraqi minorities were gassed, otherwise slaughtered, imprisoned, tortured and generally persecuted by Saddam's criminally fascist regime for decades and the west did nothing about it; indeed, it even supported this monster with aid and armaments. Today, he is long gone and Iraq is on the road to democracy.</p> <p>Blair-the-war-criminal faddists like Monbiot should think more about what Iraq would look like if Saddam had been left alone. The intervention in Iraq was perhaps justified, perhaps a monstrous folly, but that country is now a somewhat better place than the Iraq of Saddam.<br><strong>Brian Wilson</strong><br><em>Glossop, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008George Monbiot's analysis is correct. The invasion of Iraq violated the UN charter, and those who launched it committed the international crime of aggression. He might have added that Mr Blair was explicitly warned of the risk of prosecution for this offence by Lord Goldsmith, then attorney general, who wrote in his advice of 7 March 2003: \"Aggression is a crime under customary international law which automatically forms part of domestic law. It might therefore be argued that international aggression is a crime recognised by the common law which can be prosecuted in the UK courts.\" However, the headline to the article is wrong: we will not see Mr Blair facing this charge at the Hague because, as Monbiot explains, the international criminal court does not yet have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, and when it acquires jurisdiction it will not be retrospective. <br><strong>Geoffrey Bindman QC</strong><br><em>Bindmans LLP</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Failing Blair's appearance at The Hague, could he not still be impeached by the Commons for \"high crimes and misdemeanours\" in relation to the invasion of Iraq? The excellent report A Case to Answer, produced in 2004 for Adam Price MP precisely for this procedure (and strangely dropped at the time) should be revived and acted upon now by all those MPs who opposed the invasion. We don't need to wait for Chilcot.<br><strong>Raymond Fisher</strong><br><em>Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008George Monbiot is right when he says the means are weak in getting Blair to face trial. According to the Rome Statute of the ICC, an \"act of aggression\" is defined as \"the use of armed force by a state against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another state\". However, it's not all so clearcut. I have over time written to the court in furtherance of an indictment against Blair, and on 28 June this year received this reply from the office of the prosecutor: \"Most of the allegations that have been made are beyond my power to investigate since Iraq has not ratified the Rome Statute, meaning that the Court has no jurisdiction over its territory.\" So it appears that we exist in a kind of parallel universe where leaders can look to see who doesn't come under the jurisdiction of the ICC and then bomb them to smithereens.<br><strong>Richard Tippett</strong><br><em>Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008George Monbiot lists three ways the war on Iraq could have been legally justified: self-defence, humanitarian intervention, or UN security council (SC) authorisation. However, even had Blair and Bush twisted enough arms to get a second resolution, that in itself would not necessarily have made it legal. The first two would still need to be fulfilled. The SC is a political body, even when it is acting in a quasi-judicial way, and it still has to conform to international law. The only body that could give a definitive judgment on its legality is the international court of justice. Of course, it was never asked.</p> <p>But the problem is much wider than just Blair's guilt. In 1945 the UN was founded with the aim, as expressed in the preamble to its charter, \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\", and the security council, and in particular its five permanent members, was tasked with implementing that aim. Yet since 1945 there have been some 200 armed conflicts, resulting in many millions of deaths, and one or more of the P5 have been involved in almost all of them, directly or indirectly and/or by providing the weapons used. In any other sphere such incompetence (or worse, criminality) would result in severe punishment and removal from a position of power.<br><strong>Frank Jackson</strong><br><em>Former co-chair, World Disarmament Campaign</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Blair won't get his comeuppance. It is not by accident that the UN conducts its business of trying to prevent unnecessary bloodshed between its members in New York rather than Brussels or Strasbourg, ensuring that even where there has been an egregious breach of its own laws and procedures by the host country no prosecution of the aggressors will ensue.<br><strong>Bill Jackson</strong><br><em>Nottingham</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008George Monbiot's says Tony Blair \"will now find himself shut out of places where he was once welcome\" following the call from Desmond Tutu that Blair should face the ICC. Tutu's call should be widely welcomed and may well be a crucial step towards Blair appearing at The Hague, but other steps with more immediate effect can be taken that may help towards achieving that goal. It should be made clear that further canvassing by Blair for a role in the present Labour party will be rejected, which would be a great service to this country and our reputation across the world. <br><strong>Michael McGowan</strong><br><em>Former Labour MEP for Leeds</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008In support of George Monbiot's article I would say that when a prime minister endorses a document that is going to be presented to parliament and the British people and used as a \"business case\" to invade a country and cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, I believe that he or she needs to make absolutely certain that the content of that document is completely accurate.</p> <p>If the prime minister writes in the foreword to that document, \"What I believe the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons, that he continues in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and that he has been able to extend the range of his ballistic missile programme\" and \"his military planning allows for some of the WMD to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them\", and it then transpires that the country invaded does not possess even one of these weapons, the only conclusion one can draw is that the foreword was written by someone who has lied to engineer an illegal invasion of another country. In my opinion there is no doubt that such a person should be tried as a war criminal.<br><strong>David Gerrard</strong><br><em>Hove, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008As peace activists of diverse faiths and beliefs in Occupy Faith UK, the multi-faith arm of the Occupy movement, we applaud Archbishop Desmond Tutu's moral stand in calling Blair to account for war crimes before the international criminal court, and his Christian commitment to \"truth\" in rejecting a conference platform with a prime minister whose legacy has been one of lie after lie.</p> <p>We therefore view with regret the contrasting Tale of Two Bishops in the recent statement by the bishop of Derby, Dr Alastair Redfern, that \"Tony Blair is not a war criminal\" \u2013 speaking in his role as chair of the Inter Faith Network for the United Kingdom (of which Occupy Faith UK is a member body). This expensive taxpayer funded body is the national arena for the faith organisations in Britain, and has strongly resisted protests from faith leaders at its decision to admit to full membership the former prime minister's Tony Blair Faith Foundation.</p> <p>Tony Blair and George Bush have been the author of the deaths of untold numbers of innocent children, women and men in the pursuit of their illegal wars, and yet Archbishop Tutu's uncompromising integrity is a rare commodity among religious leaders, when many Church of England bishops, archbishops, Egyptian grand muftis and others have willingly eased Blair's political rehabilitation through sharing public platforms or serving on the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's board of religious advisers.</p> <p>In this 25th anniversary of the Inter Faith Network, Archbishop Tutu's challenge, \"If leaders may lie, then who should tell the truth?\", directly shames these faith leaders to speak up as prophetic and critical moral voices for the defenceless victims of Blair's crimes around the world, or risk falling into the same hypocritical collusion with power and bloodshed.<br><strong>Alan Bolwell</strong><br><strong>Mohamed Elsharkawy</strong><br><strong>Tanya Paton</strong><br><strong>Steven Burak</strong><br><strong>Sean Leigh</strong><br><em>Occupy Faith UK</em></p>",
  "<h2>Health <br></h2> <p>Doctors' leaders want new health secretary Jeremy Hunt's arrival to improve relations between the profession and ministers, which became very strained as the coalition pushed through its NHS reforms.</p> <p>\"The appointment of a new health secretary provides a fresh opportunity for doctors and government to work together to improve patient care and deal with the many challenges facing the NHS,\" said Dr Mark Porter, the British Medical Association's chair of council.</p> <p>But Labour questioned Hunt's suitability to be responsible for the NHS, pointing to a row over Hunt allegedly questioning whether the NHS should have taken pride of place in the Olympics opening ceremony. \"Right now the NHS needs somebody who believes in its values and is ready to stand up for it. Instead the prime minister has given it to the man who reportedly tried to remove the NHS tribute from the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games,\" said Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary.</p> <p>They also pointed to Hunt having been one of the Conservative politicians, including serving and future MPs, who were listed as \"co-authors\" of a 2005 book published by the right-of-centre campaign group Direct Democracy which backed \"denationalising\" the NHS. One chapter of the book said that: \"Our ambition should be to break down the barriers between private and public provision, in effect denationalising the provision of healthcare in Britain, so extending to all the choices currently available only to the minority who opt for private care.\"</p> <p>Hunt's exact role in the book, Direct Democracy: An Agenda for a New Model Party, which covered many policy areas, is unclear. \"Co-authors\" also included the education secretary, Michael Gove.</p> <p>But along with the reorganisation of the NHS, efficiency savings and repairing tattered relations between government and the NHS workforce, there was an appeal for Hunt to ask the bigger questions about the future of the health system. \"Top of Mr Hunt's in-tray will be making sure the NHS is financially sustainable for the future and fit to respond to the needs of our changing population\", said Mike Farrar, the organisation's chief executive of the NHS Confederation. <strong>DC</strong></p> <h2>Justice<br></h2> <p>Chris Grayling's appointment as the new justice secretary heralds a new hardline approach. David Cameron had grown exasperated with Kenneth Clarke and his ministerial team for what was regarded as an overly soft approach on law and order. \"We have a rightwinger at the ministry of justice,\" one government source said of Grayling, who will lead a completely new team.</p> <p>Clarke focused on managing the cuts to the prison service and the legal aid budget. Having largely taken the sting out of those two issues, he had recently been focusing on reforming community sentencing, introducing full work for prisoners and reforming the court system.</p> <p>Grayling will regard these as his main priorities too, but he will be more hardline on sentencing than Clarke. But on prisons Grayling will be more liberal than some had assumed. He is a strong supporter of the \"rehabilitation revolution\" and was consulted as shadow home secretary when it was outlined by the Tories in opposition.</p> <p>This is designed to reduce reoffending rates by providing incentives for the voluntary and private sector to find work for ex-offenders. Crispin Blunt, the outgoing prisons minister, was in the process of taking further steps to prepare prisoners for such work outside by increasing the amount of work in prison.</p> <p>Downing Street will be hoping that Grayling will change the government's tone over the European court of human rights. Clarke famously had a public bust-up with Theresa May, the home secretary, at the Tory conference last year when she claimed that a man had avoided deportation by invoking his right to a family life on the grounds that he needed to care for a cat. As a staunch Eurosceptic, Grayling will have no problem agreeing with May.</p> <p>Grayling will have to work with Clarke. The outgoing justice secretary will continue to pilot the justice and security bill through the Commons. <strong>NW</strong></p> <h2>Transport <br></h2> <p>The biggest question facing the new minister is about airport expansion, and especially Heathrow. Patrick McLoughlin \u2013 the ninth transport secretary in six years, but familiar with the territory, as an aviation minister back in the Major government \u2013 is inheriting a row over what to do next: government policy rules out a third runway in this parliament, but the Treasury has indicated it is open to the idea long term. The issue splits the government and backbenches alike. Many take his predecessor Justine Greening's move out of the transport department as a sign the plan is back on the cards \u2013 Greening had been a vocal opponent.</p> <p>There is another unresolved battle over rail, with Virgin currently seeking a judicial review of the West Coast mainline franchise award. If Virgin's legal action is dismissed, McLoughlin will just have to deal with an angry Richard Branson. If not, the consequences could be more far-reaching \u2013 possibly a review of the franchising process, delaying a host of contracts up for renewal in the next two years. He may also push the Treasury to again soften the blow on commuters of planned rail fares, set to rise between 6 and 11% in January.</p> <p>He will have to choose this autumn between the route options for the \u00a333bn high speed rail network north of Birmingham \u2014 a decision with the potential to create new areas of local opposition, particularly in London and the south.</p> <p>Roadbuilding woes lie further off. And for those Jeremy Clarksonites who believe there has been, in last-but-one incumbent Philip Hammond's words, a \"war on the motorist\", there is the promised, totemic raising of the motorway speed limit. But with road deaths climbing, McLoughlin may choose to let this one slip quietly away. <strong>GT</strong></p> <h2>Culture<br></h2> <p>Maria Miller arrives at what was once called the ministry of fun with plenty of work to do. The little-known 48-year-old has only a few weeks before she will be handed a copy of Lord Justice Leveson's conclusions of his inquiry into press standards and ethics \u2013 and will have to contend with public and industry fall out \u2013 even though the decision as to how to respond to Leveson will be taken well above her pay grade.</p> <p>She may also be in the uncomfortable position of being one of the first in government to learn whether Leveson is criticising her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, and front up what is expected to be a governmental decision to respond to calls for press reform by ducking calls for legislation.</p> <p>Her arrival also allows the department to return to normal business after Leveson's examination of Hunt's intensely scrutinised handling of the Murdoch bid for BSkyB \u2013 before the Olympics decision making at DCMS had simply seized up. A communications green paper was abandoned \u2013 a white paper is due at the turn of the year. But Hunt's thought to be quixotic local TV stations project has actually progressed so far now that it is likely to go ahead. There are 51 bidders for licences in 21 towns and cities.</p> <p>Culture is a disparate, complex department with no shortage of potentially emotive issues. Miller has to safeguard the legacy \u2013 or sustainability \u2013 of the Olympics at a time when there is public pressure to see greater participation in sport.The arts sector is contending with the impact of a near 30% funding cuts and she will also have to decide matters more technical too \u2013 whether more public money is needed to ensure broadband speeds maintain pace with other developed countries, and take a decision Hunt was keen to duck: when \u2013 if ever \u2013 it would be necessary to turn off FM radio in favour of digital. <strong>DS</strong></p> <h2>Environment<br></h2> <p>The new environment secretary, Owen Paterson, will be blooded into his new job in dramatic fashion: the start of the highly controversial badger cull in England. Animals will be shot within weeks, barring last-minute legal challenges. The cull aims to curb the scourge of tuberculosis in cattle and Paterson, when shadow environment secretary, wholeheartedly backed the farmers who support the cull.</p> <p>That is the most pressing issue in his in-tray, but the alternating threat of floods and droughts require urgent attention too. That will be tricky given the huge budget cut his predecessor accepted, the biggest of any major department. As a consequence, hundreds of flood defences that were in line for funding have not been built. With climate change increasing flood risk, the environment secretary sits one downpour from disaster.</p> <p>Rising food prices will be a challenge too, but the most important issue Paterson faces is far broader and at the heart of a fierce battle in cabinet: the fate of David Cameron's pledge to make his government the \"greenest ever\".</p> <p>As the economy has tanked, the Tory right has looked to bury that pledge in the name of growth at any cost. The environment secretary has been important \u2013 if not all that effectual in the guise of the sacked Caroline Spelman \u2013 in fighting that idea, for example by producing landmark studies on the value of the natural environment to the UK economy.</p> <p>With strong green voices in decline around the cabinet table, Paterson's key role will be how he uses his new power to argue against \u2013 or for \u2013 anti-environmental policies across government. <strong>DC</strong></p>",
  "<p>The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/03/moonies-sun-myung-moon-dies\" title=\"\"> death of Sun Myung Moon</a> has brought back to mind the panic that swept through the west in the 1970s and 80s. Moon was just about the last surviving charismatic leader of the \"cults\" that, it was widely declared, threatened to undermine our civilisation by brainwashing our youth and turning them into zombies prepared to do anything \u2013 including mass suicide and murder.</p> <p>Apart from Moon and his Unification Church, there was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Berg\" title=\"\">David Berg and his Children of God</a>, who became renowned for their practice of \"<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Flirty%20Fishing\" title=\"\">flirty fishing</a>\"; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness\" title=\"\">Prabhupada</a> and his International Society for Krishna Consciousness devotees, who could be seen dancing and chanting on the streets; Bhagwan Rajneesh, later called Osho, and his sannyasins; and L Ron Hubbard's Church of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/scientology\" title=\"\">Scientology</a> \u2013 and literally hundreds of other men and women selling their spiritual wares in San Francisco, New York, Montreal, Paris, Tokyo and London.</p> <p>Exactly what it was that was on offer varied enormously. But the general public was largely unaware of the differences, informed as it was by sensationalist media themselves fanned by a burgeoning number of so-called \"anti-cult groups\", which had started as gatherings of concerned relatives but developed into powerful lobbying groups that accumulated all the worrying stories about any one movement (and there were undoubtedly several to gather), and then generalised these into a conventional wisdom about \"what all cults do\" \u2013 forgetting that all these activities could just as easily be found in the traditional religions. Not, of course, that this would make deceptive practices, sexual exploitation or child abuse any less culpable.</p> <p>But why were intelligent, well-educated young people joining the movements in droves? One answer was heard more than any other. Our youth had not chosen to convert to a new religion; they had been brainwashed into leaving their universities, abandoning promising careers, and severing ties with their families in order to live in secluded communities, working long hours for their \"puppet masters\" and, in the case of those who came to be called \"Moonies\", getting married by a Korean messiah in a mass wedding along with thousands of other couples to someone they had never met before and might not even speak English. Clearly, it was claimed, these were the victims of well nigh irresistible and irreversible mind-control techniques.</p> <p>With hindsight, some of our views of these cults need correcting. Although the colourful devotees and sannyasins and the persistent Unificationists were highly visible in public places, people were not joining in anything like the numbers that were being alleged. While estimates of the number of Unificationists in Britain topped a million, there were in fact fewer than 150 in 1976.</p> <p>It is true that thousands attended one or other of the residential weekends where the \"brainwashing\" was said to occur, but 90% did not join as a result. Of those who did, the majority left within a couple of years. Much as the movements tried to persuade people to join their ranks, and much as they would have like to have had greater persuasive powers, they demonstrably did not have access to the irresistible or irreversible techniques they were reputedly wielding.</p> <p>But things have changed. It is not that there are not still thousands of new religious movements to be found around the world \u2013 there are. Inform, the government-funded organisation that provides information on minority religions, has on its files over a thousand new religions that are currently active in the UK. But most people would be hard pushed to name more than a handful of these. Why?</p> <p>First, since 9/11, the public is now more concerned about Islamic terrorism than about cults. Second, although young (and older) people are still wanting answers to all sorts of questions about God, spirituality, the state of the world and their relations with others, they are less likely to turn to a new religion for their answers.</p> <p>Next, the movements themselves have changed quite radically. Those that caught the public's attention during the latter half of the past century (and are now well into a second- or even third-generation membership that is no longer so concerned with recruitment but, more frequently, with getting on in the outside world).</p> <p>Then the new ones that have since emerged tend to be more spiritual and far less institutionalised than the earlier movements. The Children of God no longer \"flirty fish\"; the vast majority of Krishna devotees are people of Asian origin who have found a place to carry out their traditional worship. Most Unificationists now live with their families and work independently of the movement. Those second-generation members that have stayed in the movement (although the majority have left) are likely to be married to someone their parents suggested, often with quite a bit of input from their children.</p> <p>Scientology is, perhaps, one of the few \"bogey cults\" that remains in the public eye, due partly to the number of high-level members who have recently left, and, no doubt, to the high-profile antics of Tom Cruise. Perhaps The Master, Paul Thomas Anderson's acclaimed new film on the origins of Scientology, will provide us with some further understanding of \"the cult experience\".</p>",
  "<p>When you work in the fashion industry, there are some trends that you admire from afar \u2013 shaggy faux-fur jackets, for example, or head-to-toe leather \u2013 and some that, the moment you see them, you know will end up in&#xa0;your wardrobe.</p> <p>The stocky heel \u2013 the latest shoe trend to emerge \u2013 falls into the latter category.

This is a trend that I, for one, will happily be stepping into.</p>",
  "<p>In late March 2011, as the Arab Spring was spreading, CNN sent a four-person crew to Bahrain to produce a one-hour documentary on the use of internet technologies and social media by democracy activists in the region. Featuring on-air investigative correspondent Amber Lyon, the CNN team had a very eventful eight-day stay in that small, US-backed kingdom.</p> <p>By the time the CNN crew arrived, many of the sources who had agreed to speak to them were either in hiding or had disappeared. Regime opponents whom they interviewed suffered recriminations, as did ordinary citizens who worked with them as fixers. Leading human rights activist Nabeel Rajab was <a href=\"http://www.policemc.gov.bh/en/news_details.aspx?type=1&amp;articleId=6696\">charged with crimes</a> shortly after speaking to the CNN team. A doctor who gave the crew a tour of his village and arranged meetings with government opponents, Saeed Ayyad, <a href=\"http://bahraincenter.blogspot.com.br/2011/05/attacking-and-burning-down-of-saeed.html\">had his house burned</a> to the ground shortly after. Their local fixer was fired ten days after working with them.</p> <p>The CNN crew itself was violently detained by regime agents in front of Rajab's house. As <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-11/world/bahrain.detain_1_bahrain-center-entering-bahrain-military-vehicles?_s=PM:WORLD\">they described it</a> after returning to the US, \"20 heavily-armed men\", whose faces were \"covered with black ski masks\", \"jumped from military vehicles\", and then \"pointed machine guns at\" the journalists, forcing them to the ground. The regime's security forces seized their cameras and deleted their photos and video footage, and then detained and interrogated them for the next six hours. </p> <p>Lyon's experience both shocked and emboldened her. The morning after her detention, newspapers in Bahrain prominently featured articles about the incident containing what she said were \"outright fabrications\" from the government. \"It made clear just how willing the regime is to lie,\" she told me in a phone interview last week. </p> <p>But she also resolved to expose just how abusive and thuggish the regime had become in attempting to snuff out the burgeoning democracy movement, along with any negative coverage of the government.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I realized there was a correlation between the amount of media attention activists receive and the regime's ability to harm them, so I felt an obligation to show the world what our sources, who risked their lives to talk to us, were facing.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>CNN's total cost for the documentary, ultimately titled \"iRevolution: Online Warriors of the Arab Spring\", was in excess of $100,000, an unusually high amount for a one-hour program of this type. The portion Lyon and her team produced on Bahrain ended up as a 13-minute segment in the documentary. That segment, which as of now is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB2DeZBgTEk\">available on YouTube</a>, is a hard-hitting and unflinching piece of reporting that depicts the regime in a very negative light. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395765427\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/3/1346695364375/amberlyn_460.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Lyon, former CNN report\" width=\"460\" height=\"314\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Lyon on CNN, commenting on the March 2011 repression in Bahrain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the segment, Lyon interviewed activists as they explicitly described their torture at the hands of government forces, while family members recounted their relatives' abrupt disappearances. She spoke with government officials justifying the imprisonment of activists. And the segment featured harrowing video footage of regime forces shooting unarmed demonstrators, along with the mass arrests of peaceful protesters. In sum, the early 2011 CNN segment on Bahrain presented one of the starkest reports to date of the brutal repression embraced by the US-backed regime.</p> <p>On 19 June 2011 at 8pm, CNN's domestic outlet in the US aired \"iRevolution\" for the first and only time. The program received prestigious journalism awards, including a <a href=\"http://www.newyorkfestivals.com/nabshow2012/mobile/winners-and-finalist-index.php?country=USA\">2012 Gold Medal</a> from New York Festival's Best TV and Films. Lyon, along with her segment producer Taryn Fixel, were <a href=\"http://www.livawards.org/winners/finalists.html\">named as finalists</a> for the 2011 Livingston Awards for Young Journalists. A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AmberLyonCNN\">Facebook page</a> created by Bahraini activists, entitled \"Thank you Amber Lyon, CNN reporter | From people of Bahrain\", received more than 8,000 \"likes\".</p> <p>Despite these accolades, and despite the dangers their own journalists and their sources endured to produce it, CNN International (CNNi) never broadcast the documentary. Even in the face of numerous inquiries and complaints from their own employees inside CNN, it continued to refuse to broadcast the program or even provide any explanation for the decision. To date, this documentary has never aired on CNNi.</p> <h2>CNNi's refusal to broadcast 'iRevolution'</h2> <p>It is CNN International that is, by far, the <a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/21/cnn-is-undisputed-1-international-news-channel-in-ems-middle-east-survey/?iref=allsearch\">most-watched English-speaking news outlet in the Middle East</a>. By refusing to broadcast \"iRevolution\", the network's executives ensured it was never seen on television by Bahrainis or anyone else in the region. </p> <p>CNNi's decision not to broadcast \"iRevolution\" was extremely unusual. Both CNN and CNNi have had severe budget constraints imposed on them over the last several years. One long-time CNN employee (to whom I have granted anonymity to avoid repercussions for negative statements about CNN's management) described \"iRevolution\" as an \"expensive, highly produced international story about the Arab Spring\". Because the documentary was already paid for by CNN, it would have been \"free programming\" for CNNi to broadcast, making it \"highly unusual not to air it\". The documentary \"was made with an international audience as our target\", said Lyon. None of it was produced on US soil. And its subject matter was squarely within the crux of CNN International's brand.</p> <p>CNNi's refusal to broadcast \"iRevolution\" soon took on the status of a mini-scandal among its producers and reporters, who began pushing Lyon to speak up about this decision. In June 2011, one long-time CNN news executive emailed Lyon:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Why would CNNi not run a documentary on the Arab Spring, arguably the the biggest story of the decade? Strange, no?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Motivated by the concerns expressed by long-time CNN journalists, Lyon requested a meeting with CNNi's president, Tony Maddox, to discuss the refusal to broadcast the documentary. On 24 June 2011, she met with Maddox, who vowed to find out and advise her of the reasons for its non-airing. He never did.</p> <p>In a second meeting with Maddox, which she had requested in early December to follow up on her unanswered inquiry, Lyon was still given no answers. Instead, at that meeting, Maddox, according to Lyon, went on the offense, sternly warning her not to speak publicly about this matter. Several times, Maddox questioned her about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickKristof/statuses/137632874479366146\">this 18 November 2011 tweet</a> by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, demanding to know what prompted it:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395765428\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346755081261/kristof.png\" alt=\"Kristof tweet CNN\" width=\"490\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I asked CNN to comment on Maddox's meetings with Lyon, they declined to respond on specific details and said he was not available for interview. Instead, they made the following statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The documentary 'iRevolution' was commissioned for CNN US. While the programme did not air in full on CNN International, segments of it were shown. This differing use of content is normal across our platforms, and such decisions are taken for purely editorial reasons. CNN International has run more than 120 stories on Bahrain over the past six months, a large number of which were critical in tone and all of which meet the highest journalistic standards.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite Lyon's being stonewalled by CNNi, she said facts began emerging that shined considerable light on the relationship between the regime in Bahrain and CNNi when it came to \"iRevolution\". Upon returning from Bahrain in April, Lyon <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzyyIb5_jXA&amp;feature=player_embedded\">appeared on CNN</a> several times to recount her own detention by security forces and to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y221Y8CymxU&amp;feature=player_embedded\">report on ongoing brutality</a> by the regime against its own citizens, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/world/2011/04/22/lyon.bahrain.medical.crisis.cnn\">even including doctors and nurses</a> providing medical aid to protesters. She said she did not want to wait for the documentary's release to alert the world to what was taking place.</p> <p>In response, according to both the above-cited CNN employee and Lyon, the regime's press officers complained repeatedly to CNNi about Lyon generally and specifically her reporting for \"iRevolution\". In April, a senior producer emailed her to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We are dealing with blowback from Bahrain govt on how we violated our mission, etc.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>\"It became a standard joke around the office: the Bahrainis called to complain about you again,\" recounted Lyon. Lyon was also told by CNN employees stationed in the region that \"the Bahrainis also sent delegations to our Abu Dhabi bureau to discuss the coverage.\"</p> <p>Internal CNN emails reflect continuous pressure on Lyon and others to include claims from the Bahraini regime about the violence in their country \u2013 even when, says Lyon, she knew first-hand that the claims were false. One April 2011 email to Lyon from a CNN producer demands that she include in her documentary a line stating that \"Bahrain's foreign minister says security forces are not firing on unarmed civilians,\" and another line describing regime claims accusing \"activists like Nabeel Rajab of doctoring photos \u2026 fabricating injuries\".</p> <p>Having just returned from Bahrain, Lyon says she \"saw first-hand that these regime claims were lies, and I couldn't believe CNN was making me put what I knew to be government lies into my reporting.\"</p> <h2>Bahrain's PR offensive</h2> <p>As negative news stories of its brutal repression grew in the wake of the Arab Spring, the regime undertook a massive, very well-funded PR campaign to improve its image. As <a href=\"http://bahrainwatch.org/pr/index.html\">reported by Bahrain Watch</a>, the regime has spent more than $32m in PR fees alone since the commencement of the Arab Spring in February, 2011, including payments to some of Washington, DC's most well-connected firms and long-time political operatives, such as <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/09/01/joe_trippi_bahrain/\">former Howard Dean campaign manager Joe Trippi</a>.</p> <p>One of the largest contracts the regime had was with the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/08/08/qorvis_bahrain/\">DC-based PR firm Qorvis Communications</a>. As <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2011/11/29/disappearing-dissent-how-bahrain-buried-its-revolution/#ixzz25KBamm5o\">Time reported last November</a>, the firm, which also does extensive PR work for Bahrain's close allies, the Saudi regime, \"has a branch dedicated to rehabilitating the reputation of unsavory governments, a niche practice that has seen great demand in the wake of the Arab spring\".</p> <p>Qorvis often led the way in complaining to CNNi about its Bahrain coverage. An internal email from CNN at the beginning of 2012, seen by the Guardian, records the firm's calling to complain about excessively favorable mentions of Nabeel Rajab, who had been arrested and charged over an anti-regime tweet, and was just this month <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/16/bahrain-human-rights-activist-jail\">sentenced to three years in prison</a> for an \"illegal demonstration\".</p> <p>The long-time CNN employee said that \"iRevolution\" was vetted far more heavily than the typical documentary:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Because Amber was relatively new in reporting on the region, and especially because of the vocal complaints from the Bahrainis, the documentary was heavily scrutinized. But nobody could ever point to anything factually or journalistically questionable in Amber's reporting on Bahrain.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In response to several inquiries, Bahrain's Information Affairs Authority refused to say whether they had complained to CNNi about Lyon and \"iRevolution\". A spokesman, Fahad A AlBinali, instead offered only a generic statement that \"on occasion we contact media outlets to provide correct information or a balanced view of the subject,\" and, he claimed, when doing so, they are simply trying \"to help ensure that coverage of Bahrain is accurate and unbiased\". Subsequent attempts to obtain specific answers from the authority about the regime's complaints to CNNi about \"iRevolution\" and Lyon went unanswered.</p> <p>After Lyon's crew returned from Bahrain, CNN had no correspondents regularly reporting on the escalating violence. In emails to her producers and executives, Lyon repeatedly asked to return to Bahrain. Her requests were denied, and she was never sent back. She thus resorted to improvising coverage by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02dv9noPI1A&amp;feature=player_embedded\">interviewing activists via Skype</a> in an attempt, she said, \"to keep Bahrain in the news\".</p> <p>In March 2012, Lyon was <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/layoffs-at-cnn-as-network-transitions-to-acquisition-model-for-documentary-programming_b117576\">laid off from CNN as part of an unrelated move by the network to outsource its investigative documentaries</a>. Now at work on a book, Lyon began in August to make reference to \"iRevolution\" on her Twitter account, followed by more than 20,000 people. </p> <p>On 16 August, Lyon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmberLyon/status/236154858389008384?uid=21237820&amp;iid=am-136815635413452093798387947&amp;nid=6+275\">wrote</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmberLyon/status/236155385105506305\">three</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmberLyon/status/236156232992452609\">tweets</a> about this episode. CNNi's refusal to broadcast \"iRevolution\", she wrote, \"baffled producers\". Linking to the YouTube clip of the Bahrain segment, she added that the \"censorship was devastating to my crew and activists who risked lives to tell [the] story.\" She <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmberLyon/status/236140856288096257/photo/1\">posted a picture of herself</a> with Rajab and wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A proponent of peace, @nabeelrajab risked his safety to show me how the regime oppresses the [people] of #Bahrain.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The following day, a representative of CNN's business affairs office called Lyon's acting agent, George Arquilla of Octagon Entertainment, and threatened that her severance payments and insurance benefits would be immediately terminated if she ever again spoke publicly about this matter, or spoke negatively about CNN. </p> <p>When I asked CNN specifically about this alleged threat delivered to Lyon's agent, the company declined to confirm or deny it, commenting:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In common with other companies we do not discuss internal personnel matters.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Responding to Lyon's charge of censorship, CNN's spokesman replied:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"CNN International has a proud record of courageous, independent and honest reporting from around the world. Any suggestion that the network's relationship with any country has influenced our reporting is wholly and demonstrably wrong.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It is true that CNNi can point to numerous recent reports describing the violence against protesters by the regime in Bahrain. Given the scope of the violence, and how widely it has now been reported elsewhere, it would be virtually impossible for CNNi never to broadcast such reports while still maintaining any claim to credibility. But such reports required far more journalistic courage to air in the first half of 2011, when so few knew of the brutality to which the regime had resorted, than now, when it is widely known. Moreover, CNNi's reports on the violence in Bahrain take a much more muted tone than <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/02/17/erin_burnett_worst_of_the_worst/\">when it reports on</a> regimes disfavored by the US, such as Iran or Syria. </p> <p>More importantly, the tidal wave of CNNi's partnerships and associations with the regime in Bahrain, and the hagiography it has broadcast about it (see the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/04/cnn-business-state-sponsored-news\">accompanying commentary on the relationship between the network and the regime</a>), appear to have overwhelmed any truly critical coverage.</p> <p>But CNN's threat had the opposite effect to what was intended. Lyon insists she never signed any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement with CNN in any case, but she is sanguine about any risk to her severance package. \"At this point,\" Lyon said, \"I look at those payments as dirty money to stay silent. I got into journalism to expose, not help conceal, wrongdoing, and I'm not willing to keep quiet about this any longer, even if it means I'll lose those payments.\"</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/05/cnn-internationals-response-to-the-guardian/\">\u2022 Read CNN International's response to this article </a></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/reply-to-response-from-cnni.html\">Read Glenn Greenwald's blog response to CNNi's statement</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>Dallas sneaked into our house, almost literally by&#xa0;the back door. Our babysitter Petra, the oldest daughter of our neighbours, would hop over the garden wall to look after us when Mum went out to work \u2013 and she was addicted to the oil-soaked, Stetson-studded saga of the Ewing family. Before her first month's employment was out, so were my sister and I. If it was a guilty pleasure for us, well, so it was with the rest of the nation.</p> <p>Britain had its own soap operas, of course, but they were either as down-to-earth as we could make them (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/coronation-street\" title=\"\">Coronation Street</a> set the trend, beginning in 1960 as a portrait of a working-class street in an age of transition and still staying fairly true to its gritty roots in the late 1970s when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/feb/04/nancy-banks-smith-classic-reviews\" title=\"\">Dallas</a> turned up), or they were unutterable rubbish done on the cheap by a pool of typing monkeys, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/nov/27/crossroads-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\">Crossroads</a>, the saga of a&#xa0;Birmingham motel.</p> <p>But Dallas was different. Dallas had buckets of money, on and off screen, and buckets of melodrama. It had glitz, glamour and it revelled in excess. Instead of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgSQcY3Fb8\" title=\"\">Ena Sharples</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAsaAWnscog\" title=\"\">Martha Longhurst</a> eking out port and lemons in&#xa0;the Rover's snug, it had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7tvVGBs1fU\" title=\"\">Sue Ellen</a> knocking back whiskey in the face of her husband JR's endless evil. Instead of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3p8FjbdKTU\" title=\"\">Elsie Tanner</a> in a too-tight skirt, it had everybody in satin-sheeted beds with everybody else (by 1985, there must have been more chlamydia than oil in them thar fields). Instead of Albert Tatlock acting mardy with over-educated nephew-in-law Ken Barlow, it had blood feuds, blackmail and backstabbings galore between the Ewings and Barnes families and their billions and billions of oil dollars.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/clive-james\" title=\"\">Clive James</a>, the Observer's TV critic at the time, called it: \"Every American soap opera you have ever seen rolled into one and given an unlimited charge account at Neiman Marcus.\" The average Brit had never seen any other US soap opera, didn't know what a charge account was, and drew a total blank on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/19/neiman-marcus-plane-christmas-catalogue\" title=\"\">Neiman Marcus</a>, too, but that was all part of the fun.</p> <p>Above all, of course, Dallas had the 1980s. Has there ever been a show that so perfectly encapsulated and encouraged an era? Oil and money were king, and the good guys \u2013 like Bobby \"Baaahbeee!\" Ewing and his saintly wife Pam \u2013 were left for dust by the bad. No antihero has ever been more adored than JR, as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlWejfJhgo\" title=\"\">\"Who shot JR?\"</a> global furore proved. The arrival of the \"reveal\" episodes under escort at Heathrow made the BBC news. It turned out to be his ex-lover/wife's sister (no one ever had just one role in Dallas). Her name was Kristin which, by some curious collective mental quirk, no one ever remembers without effort.</p> <p>And now it's back. The new series of the show can be thought of as Dallas: The Next Generation, as it ostensibly centres around the still-feuding offspring of the original Ewings: John Ross Junior, who is drilling for oil on the hallowed turf of Southfork itself; Bobby and Pam's adopted son, Christopher, a fan of renewable energy and of not drilling for any oil anywhere; and of course their wives. But \u2013 BUT! \u2013 the real story is that the holy trinity of JR, Sue Ellen and Bobby is back. Twenty years on, Bobby is now the paterfamilias sitting at the head of what is still the billionaire ranch-owners' only dinner table, married not to Pam (who was left terminally ill when the show ended in 1991 and, unless of course the whole thing turns out to be a dream, is now alas no longer with us), but to Ann (played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/mar/18/desperate-housewives-voiceover-narration\" title=\"\">Brenda Strong</a>, AKA the dead one from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/10/euan-ferguson-farewell-desperate-housewives\" title=\"\">Desperate Housewives</a>).</p> <p>Bobby is determined to honour Miss Ellie's dying wish not to allow drilling on Southfork; he is also harbouring A Deadly Secret. Sue Ellen has used a huge divorce settlement from JR to go into (unnamed) party politics, disappointing all of us who nursed a secret hope that she would fulfil her destiny by joining the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/04/ten-best-religious-zealots-in-literature\" title=\"\">Quivering Brethren</a>. And she can still quiver, by the way: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btftw2KXVR0\" title=\"\">Linda Gray</a>, who plays her, is 71 \u2013 but her face is virtually unchanged, still both gorgeous and preternaturally mobile, which makes either her or her surgeon the eighth wonder of the world. And as for JR \u2013 well, he's a shadow of his former self, confined to a nursing home with clinical depression. Satan, you might say, is cast down. Can he be reached? Will the scent of a feud between his son and nephew rouse the sleeping serpent? No spoilers, but I think JR just might be back \u2013 and badder than ever.</p> <p>\u2022 Dallas starts on Channel 5 on 5 September at 9pm.</p>",
  "<p>First lady Michelle Obama will have the starring role on the opening day of the Democratic convention, tasked with winning back disaffected voters and defending some of the president's more unpopular decisions such as healthcare reform.</p> <p>Campaign aides told reporters before the first lady's primetime keynote address in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday night that she was in the best position to offer a personal insight into the president's almost four years in office, a period that has seen the euphoria that greeted his election give away to disillusionment.</p> <p>Stephanie Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign manager, said that unlike Ann Romney at the Republican convention last week, Michelle Obama did not need to introduce herself or her husband to the American people.</p> <p>\"Everybody knows the first lady, everybody knows the president. But what the first lady can do better than anybody else is give a lens into the values that drive the president.\"</p> <p>Michelle Obama, who is consistently more popular than her husband in opinion polls, is aiming to cement the support of women, Latinos and the gay community \u2013 the president has a significant lead among all three \u2013 and re-energise liberals disappointed that the president has not done enough. In her speech, she will spell out some of Obama's personal motivations behind key decisions.</p> <p>The prevailing mood among delegates in Charlotte is anxiety over Obama's re-election prospects as economic recover remains sluggish \u2013 a stark contrast to the optimism and confidence of the 2008 convention.</p> <p>The economy will dominate the event, which kicked off amid a row over whether voters were better off now than four years ago. A poll for<a href=\"http://gop12.thehill.com/2012/09/the-hill-poll-tough-fundamentals-for.html\"> the Hill magazine on Monday </a>found that 52% of voters surveyed felt worse off now than when Obama took office, and that 54% that he did not deserve re-election based solely on his job performance.</p> <p>Obama will attempt to overturn those concerns on Thursday night at a rally in a 73,000-seater football stadium where he will deliver his speech accepting the Democratic nomination. It will focus almost entirely on the economy, and will lay out a \"road map for what the next four years should look like\", White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer told a Politico panel session on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Michelle, who initially advised her husband against going into politics and who was reluctantly co-opted into campaigning in 2008, has been much more active in this campaign, particularly with fundraising. She has given 24 speeches since March in 10 states.</p> <p>Speaking at an ABC News and Yahoo News event in Charlotte, Cutter indicated that the first lady would be talking about some of the personal experiences in the president's life that has led him to make some of the difficult and \"unpopular\" choices he has made in his first term. </p> <p>She gave the example of his health reform, dubbed \"Obamacare\" by his opponents. The health reform was motivated in part, Cutter suggested, by the fact that Barack Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, struggled to find health insurance as she was dying from cancer.</p> <p>\"Very politically unpopular, a tough thing to get done, we've been trying for 70 years to get it done. But his mother had a healthcare story in her final days, and it was that memory that drove him to get healthcare done.\"</p> <p>Cutter also pointed to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first bill signed into law by the president that increased the power of women suffering from discrimination to seek legal redress. She said that the president's grandmother had been passed over for promotion at the local bank where she worked by male workers doing the same job she did.</p> <p>\"These choices come from a place of personal experience, and Michelle can speak very personally about that motivation and values and all of the things that drive him to do the things he does. She is a first-person testament to what the president has done over the last four years to show some pretty strong leadership in trying times,\" Cutter said.</p> <p>Ledbetter is among those invited to speak to the convention.</p> <p>Obama and vice-president Joe Biden are to be formally nominated as the party's White House candidates on Wednesday.</p> <p>In his speech on Thursday, Obama will set out his plans for a second term, including completion of healthcare and education reforms.</p> <p>A theme that appears to be developing from the Obama campaign is that should voters give him the chance of a second term, he would use it to create \"an economy built to last\". </p> <p>Ben LaBolt, Obama's campaign press secretary, said the focus of the convention would be \"on the pillars of an economy built to last: energy, manufacturing, education, restoring economic security for the middle class with investments in these areas instead of cutting back.\"</p> <p>The party would hear, he said, \"where we are going to go from here. That's what we didn't hear [from the Republicans] in Tampa last week.</p> <p>But other campaign staff hinted that there would be little new in the way of policy detail in Obama's speech.</p> <p>Aides suggested that the president would also show an element of humility over his record. </p> <p>Senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, an old ally of the Obamas from Chicago and now one of the most powerful people in the administration, admitted the president had made a mistake in his first year in office by failing to get out around the country to sell his reforms.</p> <p>Speaking at a convention event organised by Bloomberg, she said the president \"did not appreciate how important it was to tell that story\".</p> <p>Wednesday's keynote speech by Bill Clinton, who was critical of Obama during the 2008, is the only convention speech not yet vetted by the Obama campaign team.</p> <p>Jen Psaki, a campaign spokeswoman travelling with the president, claimed to be relaxed about the lack of an advance copy: \"We have absolute confidence about what he's going to say.\"</p>",
  "<p>MegaFon, Russia's second-largest mobile phone operator, is seeking permission for a \u00a32.5bn float in London, the world's biggest since Facebook listed in New York in May.</p> <p>Russia's richest man, Alisher Usmanov, who took control of the company in April, is reported to have asked the local regulator for permission for the flotation, which could be launched within three or four weeks.</p> <p>That would give investors the chance to buy into a firm that has positioned itself aggressively for the rollout of high-speed mobile data services loved by smartphone-toting urban Russians, and which is backed by the impeccable Kremlin connections of Usmanov, the Arsenal FC shareholder whose fortune is estimated by Forbes magazine at $18.1bn (\u00a311.4bn).</p> <p>Russia is one of the world's busiest mobile phone markets, with the third-highest penetration in the world behind the United Arab Emirates and Panama. The country's 227m mobile subscriptions cover over 150% of the population because almost all of the 144 million inhabitants have a mobile phone, with many owning more than one working SIM card. Megafon has 63m subcriptions.</p> <p>MegaFon has requested permission from Russia's financial markets regulator to list up to 123m shares abroad, equivalent to 19.9% of the company, according to Reuters. \"We are considering the possibility of holding an IPO,\" MegaFon said in response to questions from the news agency. \"The timing of the public offering will depend on market conditions.\"</p> <p>The float will see Teliasonera, the Swedish carrier, reduce its stake in Megafon to 25.1%.</p> <p>Competition is fierce in Russia among the three main networks - MTS, Megafon and Vimpelcom - with MTS having about 70m subscriptions and Vimpelcom 56m. Five other networks have around 38m subscriptions between them.</p> <p>Investors will be keen to buy a slice of the fast-growing company, analysts said, which comes as the mobile operators jostle for position in the race to sell 4G (fourth-generation) mobile services to the public.</p> <p>In July, Usmanov increased his influence in Russia's telecoms sector by combining his MegaFon stake into a holding company he controls that will own state-backed next-generation operator Scartel.</p> <p>The same month MegaFon was one of four companies to win a 4G licence, allowing it to provide superfast wireless internet using the LTE service, which is expected to become the global industry standard. In May it had used Scartel's network to launch LTE services in Moscow.</p> <p>\"MegaFon looks attractive because it is the leader on the Russian mobile internet market,\" Sergei Libin, Moscow-based analyst at Raiffeisen.</p> <p>\"MegaFon's IPO is likely to be one of the few positive Russian stories due to the combination of healthy business growth and good corporate governance,\" said Tibor Bokor, a London-based analyst at ING.</p> <p>It would be the largest IPO by a Russian company since state bank VTB raised $8bn in 2007. Notable Russian IPOs since include aluminium group Rusal's $2.2bn listing in Hong Kong in 2010 and internet search engine Yandex's $1.4bn float on the US Nasdaq exchange in May 2011.</p> <p>Waiting in the wings is Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, after forecast-beating quarterly results last week raised the likelihood that the often-delayed sale of a 7.6% state holding worth $5bn would go ahead.</p> <p>Mid-sized lender Promsvyazbank has also sought clearance from the regulator to float up to 25% in London in a deal managers have said could raise $1bn.</p> <p>A MegaFon IPO would be a defining deal for Usmanov, an Uzbek-born metals and mining magnate who has shown a deft touch as a tech investor and made 10 times his money investing in Facebook stock three years before it listed.</p> <p>But the enthusiasm for new technology offerings may have been dimmed by the dismal performance of Facebook shares after its $16bn offering: the shares floated at $38 but are now trading below $18, even while global stock markets have drifted higher through the summer.</p> <p>One source close to the deal said a launch of the IPO is probably three to four weeks away. MegaFon CEO Ivan Tavrin signalled in June that an IPO was some way off due to difficult market conditions.</p> <p>Sources have previously said Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had been appointed to lead the IPO. Other banks including Sberbank, Citi, Credit Suisse and VTB are also involved, sources and Reuters publication IFR have said.</p> <p>Megafon is also in negotiations to buy a stake in Russian mobile phone retailer Euroset, Reuters said. Euroset co-owner Alexander Mamut has been looking to sell his 50.1% stake since last December.</p> <p>MegaFon is majority owned by Usmanov's AF Telecom, which holds 50% plus one share of the company, while 35.6% is owned by Teliasonera, and 14.4% is held by the company as treasury stock.</p> <p>Teliasonera spokesman Thomas Jonsson confirmed that preparations for the MegaFon float were continuing but declined to elaborate.</p> <p>Analysts said valuation was more important than timing to TeliaSonera.</p> <p>\"Telia has been saying that it is dependent on market conditions and they are not particularly happy with the peer-group multiples of Russian assets as things stand,\" said James Britton, an analyst at Nomura Securities in London.</p> <p>\"Our view is that we certainly expect there to be some delay,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>A year ago, the former head of MI5, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_Manningham-Buller,_Baroness_Manningham-Buller\" title=\"\">Eliza Manningham-Buller</a>, raised eyebrows in the darker recesses of Whitehall by telling some home truths in&#xa0;her BBC Reith lectures about the security and intelligence agencies.</p> <p>She returns to her three key themes \u2013 torture, terrorism and secrecy \u2013 on Thursday with the publication of a short book, Securing Freedom, based on&#xa0;those lectures. It is a refreshing antidote to the rhetoric deployed by ministers and their acolytes who appear too frightened to come clean on any issue relating to that elusive but overarching concept of \"national security\". Here are some points that MI5, MI6, the CIA and the new justice secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/chris-grayling-jeremy-hunt-reshuffle?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Chris Grayling</a> should note:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> \"Torture is illegal in our national law and in international law. It is wrong and never justified ... Torture should be utterly rejected even when it may offer the prospect of saving lives \u2026 I am confident that I know the answer to the question of whether torture has made the world a safer place. It hasn't.\"</p> <p>MI5 and MI6 remain embroiled in the unresolved dispute about their role in the abuse and torture of terror suspects. The government tried to push allegations under the carpet by compensating UK residents and citizens taken by the CIA to Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 and no sooner had it done so than evidence emerged in Libya showing how MI6 helped arrange the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/31/libyan-dissidents-sue-mi6-officer\" title=\"\">abduction of Libyan dissidents to Tripoli</a>, where they say they were tortured by Muammar Gaddafi's secret police. \"There are clearly questions to be answered about ... whether the UK supped with a sufficiently long spoon,\" says Manningham-Buller, who was head of MI5 at the time. MI6, which was ultimately accountable to then foreign secretary, Jack Straw, says the rendering of the dissidents to Libya in 2004 was authorised by ministers.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> \"Rushing to legislate in the wake of a terrorist atrocity is often a mistake,\" says Manningham-Buller in a clear reference to the Blair government's practice of drawing up more and more \"counter-terrorism\" laws, a practice sharply criticised by Ken Clarke, now sacked as justice secretary. \"We compound the problem of terrorism if we use it to erode the freedom of us all,\" she adds. To the surprise of her former colleagues in MI5, she used her maiden speech in the Lords to attack the Labour government's proposal to detain suspected terrorists without charge for up to 42 days.</p> <p>Will the reshuffled government succumb to pressure from the security and intelligence agencies and introduce more laws they hope will frighten terrorists, ignoring the root causes? Governments, including the British, talk&#xa0;to terrorists, and, Manningham-Buller reminds us, they have \"too often preferred the stability of the devil we know to the uncertainties of democracy\" \u2013 a reference to the Arab spring and Britain's close relations with Middle Eastern autocracies.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> \"The scrutiny of the security and intelligence agencies will evolve, and it is right that it should. But, given that intelligence to counter these threats will still be needed, that scrutiny will never be able to be transparent. For to secure freedom, within a democracy and within the law, some secrets have to remain.\" And there's the rub. \"Overt information may be more important than secret intelligence. There are those, the sceptical observers I wish the readers of intelligence to be, who believe that governments hype threats for their own purposes to ensure legislation proceeds through parliament.\"</p> <p>The coalition government is determined to push through into law its \"justice and security\" bill designed to prevent any information from the security and intelligence agencies, domestic or foreign, from ever being disclosed in court. The very existence of such secret hearings would be secret, if the government has its way. Ironically, its fate may well end up in the hands of Manningham-Buller and others in the (unreformed) House of Lords.</p>",
  "<p>It was just over 40 years ago that he arguably changed the world: a beautiful, sexually ambiguous young man with a 26in waist, flame orange hair, pale makeup, a silk jumpsuit and red patent leather boots performing Starman on Top of the Pops and looking like nothing else that had gone before.</p> <p>\"It was a pivotal performance that changed pop history and turned David Bowie into a star,\" said the V&amp;A's Victoria Broackes. \"We could do an exhibition just on the number of people who saw that performance and said it changed their lives.\"</p> <p>The V&amp;A is going for the bigger picture though and has announced details of the first museum retrospective for a man who is one of the most influential performers of modern times.</p> <p>The museum has been allowed into Bowie's vast private archive in New York and given unprecedented access to some 60,000 items \u2013 costumes, photographs, designs, instruments, films \u2013 from which it has chosen around 300 for the show next spring.</p> <p>The tiny Starman costume, used for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muMcWMKPEWQ\" title=\"\">the performance on 6 July 1972</a> of the first single from his Ziggy Stardust album \u2013 \"I think he was living on a diet of cocaine, milk and red peppers,\" said Broackes, the show's co-curator \u2013 will be a highlight, as it should be.</p> <p>For the time it was an extraordinary performance, not least the way Bowie \u2013 who had told Melody Maker he was bisexual \u2013 effortlessly draped his arm around guitarist Mick Ronson.</p> <p>\"It was the manner of presentation, the way he pointed down the camera and was saying to people 'I look different, you can be different, you can be whoever you want to be,'\" said Broackes. \"Yes people were wearing pretty wacky things but Bowie was getting through to people in a different sort of way and allowing them to be individuals.\"</p> <p>The novelist Jake Arnott <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/23/fiction.davidbowie\" title=\"\">has written of his 11-year-old self</a> playing at being Bowie and Ronson in his garden with his friend Pete. Ian McCulloch, of Echo and the Bunnymen, remembered it this way: \"All my other mates at school would say 'Did you see that bloke on Top Of The Pops?' He's a right faggot, him!' And I remember thinking 'You pillocks' \u2026 It made me feel cooler.\"</p> <p>The V&amp;A show will be an exploration and celebration of Bowie's creative spirit and it will make big claims. \"Bowie has played a crucial role in shaping modern society due to his focus on personal self-expression that we in the west, at least, now take as a right,\" said the exhibition's other curator Geoffrey Marsh.</p> <p>\"Bowie may not have set out to do this \u2026 but help change the world he did and the ripples of those changes continue to move outwards around the globe today.\"</p> <p>The V&amp;A stressed it was the museum's show. The famously controlling Bowie has no say in it. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/18/david-bowie-victoria-albert-museum-costumes\" title=\"\">recent story in the Observer</a> suggested he would part curate the exhibition prompting a rare response on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/davidbowie/posts/10151008802892665\" title=\"\">his Facebook page</a>.</p> <p>Bowie, who lives almost reclusively in Manhattan with his wife Iman and daughter Lexi, 12, wrote: \"I am not a co-curator and did not participate in any decisions relating to the exhibition.\" He added: \"A close friend of mine tells me that I'm neither 'devastated', 'heartbroken' nor 'uncontrollably furious' by this news item.\"</p> <p>No one from the V&amp;A has sat down face to face with Bowie and, given he does not fly, it would be a surprise to everyone if he even made it along.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry to say I've never met him,\" said Broackes. \"Of course I'd love to and I really hope he likes it but in a way, because the V&amp;A always takes editorial control of what it produces, it is better that we haven't met him.\"</p> <p>Marsh said there were piles of books on Bowie \u2013 \"I'm sure there will be many more university doctorates\" \u2013 but this is the first significant exhibition and he promised it would be \"groundbreaking\" and hopefully achieve the almost impossible task of appealing to both diehard fans and an audience too young to really know how much of an influence Bowie was and still is.</p> <p>That present tense is important and the V&amp;A has called its show \u2013 which has taken two and a half years to plan \u2013 '\"David Bowie is.</p> <p>\"It underpins a key tenet of the exhibition,\" said Broackes. \"David Bowie's impact today.\"</p> <p>It will examine what has influenced him \u2013 German expressionism, music hall, Theatre of Cruelty, French chanson, surrealism, Brechtian theatre, avant-garde mime, musicals and Japanese kabuki to name a few \u2013 and the countless artists he in turn has influenced.</p> <p>The show will include costumes such as the Union Jack coat designed by Bowie and Alexander McQueen for the Earthling album cover and the outrageous striped bodysuit Kansai Yamamoto designed for the 1973 Aladdin Sane tour; classic photographs by Brian Duffy and Terry O'Neill; and excerpts from videos and films including The Man Who Fell to Earth and Labyrinth.</p> <p>The V&amp;A has held exhibitions about The Supremes, Kylie Minogue and Annie Lennox. There may be some who sniff at the V&amp;A staging a show on Bowie, but it points out it is the museum for performance and theatre. Broackes added: \"I don't feel there is an argument unless you think museums should be filled with things from the past. This museum has never been like that or about that.\"</p> <p><em>Tickets are now on sale for David Bowie is at the V&amp;A from 23 March-28 July 2013</em></p>",
  "<p>Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said he believes the next runway built in the south-east would be a second at Stansted, as he outlined his interest in bidding to run the Essex airport. But he added a third runway at Heathrow was \"inevitable\".</p> <p>He revealed he had been in talks with various potential investors about buying and running the airport, Ryanair's largest UK base, since BAA announced it would no longer fight the competition commission's ruling which forced it to sell.</p> <p>The Irish airline called on the airport regulator, the CAA, to confirm if and how it will reduce Stansted's landing charges, which Ryanair said have grown by 68% in the last five years, while traffic has significantly declined. O'Leary claimed the CAA was allowing BAA to \"cook the books\" by inflating Stansted's assets. The airport is valued at \u00a31.3bn although analysts predict it will not raise that sum.</p> <p>He said: \"The next runway in the south-east will be at Stansted. The south-east does need additional runway capacity: the advantage of Stansted is that it has already got planning permission, the land already exists, it's ready to roll. What it needs is a government decision allowing it to go ahead.\"</p> <p>In reference to the longer term, he added: \"I think a third runway at Heathrow is inevitable, then there will be a second runway at Gatwick.\"</p> <p>But, he said: \"Not in my grandchildren's lifetime will there be some lunatic airport in the Essex marshes or the Thames estuary or any other estuary.\"</p> <p>Asked whether an airline would be allowed to have a stake in the running of a British airport, he pointed out a consortium of British airlines including IAG part-owns the air traffic control service NATS. Ryanair carries two-thirds of passengers flying from Stansted.</p> <p>Ryanair would limit its holdings to below 25% but would want a management role. O'Leary said he could quickly reduce costs at the \"grossly mismanaged\" airport by scrapping \"the cathedral of check-in desks\" in favour of more retail space and \"blowing up the train\" that takes passengers from the terminal to the departure gates, replacing it with a bridge for passengers to walk over instead.</p> <p>O'Leary said he would not force passengers to pay to use a toilet should he own or run the airport. In fact, he said, his often quoted plan to make passengers pay to pee in when flying was dependent on making airport toilets the cheaper option, so he could install more seats on his plane.</p> <p>For now, true to form, O'Leary confirmed that Ryanair customers \"with no life and no friends\" who wanted to download its new mobile booking app would have to pay \u20ac3 for the privilege. \"If you want it you can pay for it.\"</p> <p>The bullish airline boss also said he \"didn't care\" that Suzy McLeod, a Ryanair passenger, had recently won the support of hundreds of thousands of Facebook users after being forced to pay \u20ac60 per person for the airline to print out boarding passes for her family of five at Alicante airport. He said: \"We think Mrs McLeod should pay for being so stupid.\"</p>",
  "<p>I recently took a trip through the Moors, en route to Whitby. The train from Middlesbrough meandered through miles of lavish Yorkshire countryside, stopping at tiny hamlets like <a href=\"http://www.eskvalleyrailway.co.uk/stations/castletonmoor.html\" title=\"\">Castleton Moor</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.eskvalleyrailway.co.uk/stations/ruswarp.html\" title=\"\">Ruswarp</a>.</p> <p>It was positively barbaric. Yes, the cottages are beautiful, but try getting a signal on your mobile. And if you do get a signal, try ordering a delivery from Ocado. This isn't entirely metropolitan snobbery. Whitby, a grand seaside town, is also the only town I've visited where \"golliwogs\" can still be won in arcade games.</p> <p>Now they want to dig up this achingly lush landscape for some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash\" title=\"\">potash</a>, a fertiliser ingredient. Imagine my sorrow. Sarcasm aside, the 11 local organisations now <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-16635060\" title=\"\">opposing</a> this development have a real grievance. This will be one of the biggest mines of its kind in the world, and will despoil 4.5 hectares of the 100 hectares of forestry already owned by York Potash, a subsidiary of the mineral mining company Sirius. The landscape is not only of aesthetic value, but also provides carbon storage, biodiversity and forms a natural flood defence, all of which are difficult to put a cash value on.</p> <p>Sirius promises that any negative effects will be outweighed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/03/potash-mine-north-york-moors?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">by the creation of 1,000 new jobs</a>. This is always the fastest route to the moral high ground for mining and development capital. Thus, some of the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/9517285/Siriuss-UK-potash-mine-plan-that-will-create-1000-jobs-blasted-by-environmental-campaigners.html\" title=\"\">opposition</a> from environmental campaigners hinges on the prospective damage to the economy, particularly tourism. But this merely highlights the false nature of the dilemma \u2013 growth versus sustainability\u2013 posed by mining interests.</p> <p>The real underlying issue in this, as in most controversies related to the exploitation of natural resources, is democracy. As George Monbiot has <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2012/08/02/dance-with-the-one-who-brung-you/\" title=\"\">argued</a>: \"The first prerequisite for protecting the environment is a functioning democracy.\" Whether it is in Brazil, India, Canada, or Britain, the struggles that take place are invariably over who gets the final say in what is done with the planet's wealth.</p> <p>Take, for example, the Rio Tinto potash mine in Mendoza, Argentina, which was <a href=\"http://www.europamines.net/195-argentina-mining-mendozas-turn.html\" title=\"\">approved</a> last month. Opposition centred on potential environmental damage and the creation of salt waste deposits that would pollute the drinking water. Rio Tinto was not trusted by locals to keep the area safe and clean. In addition, the opposition felt that they should have a say in how the country's resources were exploited. This <a href=\"http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/d2a23ad2d50cb2a280256eb300385855/5eb03ffbdd19ea90c1257664004831bd/$FILE/MartinezAlier.pdf\" title=\"\">environmentalism of the poor</a> is sometimes erroneously called \"resource nationalism\": it is just a matter of democracy.</p> <p>On the face of it, mining in the Moors is a different proposition. The major objection is that it's taking place in a national park, conserved for the benefit of the public: a blot on a beautiful landscape. Surely the opposition is conservative and romantic? But taken as part of the government's wider strategy for development we can see that similar issues are at stake.</p> <p>This government is engaged in a hasty retreat from environmental commitments regarding regional development. The potash development follows the abolition of the Regional Spatial Strategies inherited from the last government that, while foregrounding industrial development, included targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases and the development of sustainable industry.</p> <p>Furthermore, the government is intent on handing more leverage to business in how development takes place. Regional development agencies funded by central government were disbanded in this government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/nov/09/lords-quangos\" title=\"\">Public Bodies Bill</a> as part of a wider offensive against the public sector. The bill also included a plan to sell off the national forests to private developers, a controversial proposal abandoned at the last minute. These agencies have been replaced by local enterprise partnerships, which are not funded by central government but involve voluntary relationships between local governments and businesses.</p> <p>As a result, local authorities wishing to generate income and encourage development must subordinate everything to creating a convivial environment for investors. The York and North Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership naturally makes the potash extraction industry a central component of its growth strategy. You can hardly blame them \u2013 there aren't many other opportunities coming in areas, particularly Scarborough and Whitby, hit hard by spending cuts.</p> <p>So, here is the problem. Two major developments of neoliberalism obstruct environmental justice. First, neoliberal reform has been hollowing out what little democracy parliament affords us, the shift from quangos to voluntary coalitions between government and capital merely confirming popular exclusion from decision-making. Second, when the economy provides few investment opportunities, neoliberalism offers \"accumulation by dispossession\"; turning over previously public goods, whether hospitals or park land, to private profit. This can always be presented as \"creating jobs\".</p> <p>The only answer to this is to assert popular sovereignty over the environment. On that account alone, it would be a step forward if Yorkshire residents stopped the potash mine.</p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond has signalled that he is ready to strike a deal with David Cameron on the terms of the Scottish independence referendum within weeks.</p> <p>Unveiling his devolved government's next batch of legislation at Holyrood, the first minister said he expected to meet the prime minister \"in the next few weeks\" to conclude the talks about the remit and legal basis for the referendum due in autumn 2014.</p> <p>Salmond's remarks suggest he has dropped hopes of staging a two-question referendum, after failing to find any influential and prominent supporters able to campaign for an extra option of increased devolution short of independence.</p> <p>Salmond's officials indicated he had also abandoned his previous objections to meeting Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, first but insisted that the crucial meeting would be the one between the first minister and prime minister.</p> <p>A spokesman for the first minister said discussions about fixing a date for the Salmond-Cameron meeting were \"well advanced\". Downing Street officials were much cooler, insisting that no date had been fixed for a meeting between the two leaders.</p> <p>Cameron and Moore, who survived the UK government reshuffle on Tuesdaydespite rumours he might be replaced, have pressed Salmond to hold a simple \"yes or no\" poll, while conceding that the referendum would be extended to 16 and 17-year-olds.</p> <p>They have also insisted that a deal be struck in October to allow the legal powers needed for Holyrood to stage the referendum to come into force in time. Salmond confirmed that a bill to set up the referendum was at the centre of his legislative programme, followed by legislation to introduce same-sex marriages, \u2013 a measure facing heavy resistance from the Scottish Catholic church. The first minister brushed off opposition complaints that his new legislative programme was \"weak and tired\", insisting that only independence could give the Scottish parliament the full suite of powers it needed to support its economy and protect the welfare state.</p> <p>Salmond told Holyrood that his government's economic policies, including business rates relief for 160,000 companies, supporting enterprise agencies and accelerating capital spending, had meant the decline in output stood at 0.2% in Scotland against 0.7% across the UK, while employment rates were higher too.</p> <p>Urging Cameron to release Treasury money for further capital spending, to combat the recession, Salmond said: \"The record of this parliament is the clearest possible evidence that the best people to make decisions about the future of Scotland are the people who choose to live and work in our country.</p> <p>\"We will give them the choice of independence: responsibility for ourselves as a nation, a voice in the world, and government that reflects the people's priorities and Scottish values.\"</p> <p>Among the 15 bills were measures to dramatically increase childcare for three and four-year-olds to 600 hours per annum in 2014, first promised by Salmond's government in 2007; reforms of the Scottish criminal justice system; a new property-sales tax; increased cooperation between the NHS and councils on adult health and social care; and rationalisation of Scotland's colleges.</p> <p>Johann Lamont, the Scottish Labour leader, said that Salmond's programme missed a series of opportunities for more dramatic and ambitious measures: there was no sign of the trailed measures on reforming local democracy, no land reform bill and no measures to stimulate youth sports following the Olympics.</p> <p>She accused Salmond of wasting the first-ever full majority government at Holyrood: the childcare measures were first promised five years ago, she said.</p> <p>\"What we saw today was a tired first minister in charge of a flagging government who no longer has anything to offer the people of Scotland other than a referendum he continues to dither over,\" Lamont said.</p> <p>\"This legislative programme was largely an uninspired mix of re-announcements and technical bills which show a government out of ideas.\"</p>",

Obviously Impala mainman Kevin Parker is on something of a roll right now because he also found time to work, over in his home town of Perth, on the self-titled debut album by Parisian girl wonder Melody Prochet, a classically trained singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who operates as Melody's Echo Chamber. Prochet, not to be confused with <a href=\"http://www.melodygardot.com\" title=\"\">Gardot</a>, finished the record herself at her grandparents' beach house in Cavali\u00e8re in France, but the fact is, Parker's imprint is all over MEC, giving it a surface dazzle and cosmic effervescence that is very AWATS.</p> <p>It's also heavily influenced by krautrock, space-rock, dream-pop, electronica and shoegaze. We decided the music on the tracks by yesterday's 19-year-old rapper from New York, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/03/new-band-dominic-lord\" title=\"\">Dominic Lord</a>, could have resulted from the studio sorcery of Cocteau Twins' Robin Guthrie, and we're going to say the same thing about today's twentysomething French musician. The fact is, in a lot of instances, Prochet could sing over Lord's tracks, while he could rap over hers. How did that happen? Maybe <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/may/04/readers-panel-cocteau-twins\" title=\"\">Treasure</a>, without us realising, was big in Harlem and Paris in the 90s. We don't make the rules, we're just reporting on the action.</p> <p>Anyway, Melody's Echo Chamber is a fine record indeed. Throughout, Prochet doesn't so much sing as coo, a coup for those of us allergic to over-emoting. As a songwriter she appears to be in thrall to the Beatles, sunshine pop and French melody. The single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29I0srhPwg&amp;feature=youtu.be\">I Follow You</a> is as pretty as one of those mid-60s melodies so beloved of St Etienne, while the production is less lush than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBDpKzjE0E\" title=\"\">Lush</a>. Crystallized sounds like the work of a shoegaze Beatles, with a bass wig-out at the end. You Won't Be Missing That Part of Me is lovely, even if the title begs the question: Why? Has she had it surgically removed and placed in his suitcase? Some Time Alone, Alone is also great. Powered by a fuzzy guitar riff and a gorgeous counter-motif, it induces ecstasies of ecclesiastical evanescence. It really does. Snowcapped Andes Crash is a detour into 60s cool-jazz territory and Be Proud of Your Kids is a feast of celestial sonics and wispy, whispery vocals. We have no idea what Prochet is singing about, whether in English or French (she alternates), but then, as she says, that just allows her to get away with what might be lyrical murder. \"I've listened to so much English music, and you are able to sing more ridiculous things in English,\" she says, possibly thinking of <a href=\"http://www.funtrivia.com/playquiz/quiz29622721e9d70.html\" title=\"\">Champagne Supernova by Oasis</a>.

  "<p>The odds against an Israeli military strike on Iran in the next few months appear to be lengthening, and perhaps the strongest evidence comes from none other than Binyamin Netanyahu, the man who has beaten the war drums loudest over the past few months. </p> <p>By calling for<a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4276757,00.html\"> clear international (read US) 'red lines'</a> containing Iran's nuclear programme, the Israeli prime minister has put the focus back on diplomacy, and given himself a ladder to climb down from his earlier rhetoric.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ehud Barak, the defence minister who had claimed that Iran was approaching a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/magazine/will-israel-attack-iran.html?pagewanted=all\">'zone of immunity'</a> beyond which it could not be stopped, is now reported to be <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-barak-livni-axis.premium-1.462096#.UEYkt0aRCqQ.twitter\">against an Israeli attack (\u00a3)</a> before the coming US presidential elections.</p> <p>Consequently, Mike Rogers, the head of the US House intelligence committee returned from a visit to Israel with the conviction that Israel <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/gop-convention-tampa/246087-intel-chairman-israel-waiting-until-after-us-election-for-iran-strike\">will not launch an attack</a> before the US vote in November. According to The Hill online, the Republican congressman said the Israeli threat had lifted for now, \"because I think they believe that maybe after the election they could talk the United States into cooperating\".</p> <p>Such cooperation would be more likely in the event of a Mitt Romney victory in November, and with the poor state of the US economy, that seems increasingly possible. Netanyahu would look particularly foolish if he led Israel into a conflict on its own, just weeks before a close US ally came to power in Washington. The former CIA chief and current Romney adviser, Michael Hayden, was in Israel yesterday echoing the Obama administration message that <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/former-cia-chief-tells-haaretz-decision-on-iran-strike-can-wait.premium-1.462519\">military action can wait. </a></p> <p>Writing in Haaretz, the columnist Amos Harel, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/in-the-iranian-poker-game-netanyahu-and-barak-have-overplayed-their-hand.premium-1.462525\">notes that Israel Hayom (\u00a3) </a>, owned by the American casino magnate and one of Romney's biggest backers, Sheldon Adelson, and which is widely viewed as a Netanyahu mouthpiece, has considerably toned down its coverage of Iran's nuclear programme in recent days. Harel's reading is that Netanyahu and Barak have overplayed their hand in poker terms, and have realised they have damaged Israel's relationship with the US for little or no strategic gain.</p> <p>David Remnick <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/03/120903fa_fact_remnick\">reports in the current edition (\u00a3) </a> of the New Yorker on the substantial lobby in the Israeli security and intelligence agencies who are opposed to unilateral Israeli action this year. The patron saint of the dissidents, the former Mossad chief, Meir Dagan, tells Remnick in a particularly striking passage: </p> <blockquote> <p>After 33 years in the military and intelligence...[y]ou discover it is possible to get dragged into something and then it is hard to explain why it all happened. It's easy to go from being a victim to being an oppressor. You always have to pay attention to your internal moral compass and ask the right questions. </p> </blockquote> <p>The background to all this is <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/sep/04/iaea-report-full-document\">the latest report</a> from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the Iranian programme which failed to provide an unambiguous springboard for urgent action. It showed relentless progress, with a rough doubling of the number of centrifuges installed at Fordow, a heavily-protected site dug into the side of a mountain, and the main focus of Israeli and western concern. But the new centrifuges have not been turned on. The number of machines actually producing 20%-enriched uranium (critical because it can relatively easily be turned into weapons grade material) at Fordow has remained constant.</p> <p>And although IAEA reported that Iran has so far produced near 190 kg of 20%-enriched uranium, (theoretically enough for a warhead if it was further enriched) it has used 71 kg of that total for the production of reactor fuel plates, which are harder to turn into weapons-grade fuel.</p> <p>As Shashank Joshi <a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/go.php?structureID=commentary&amp;ref=C5044947B3D809#.UEYFn79y9E4\">argues in an analysis </a>for the Royal United Service Institute, it is questionable whether Barak's 'zone of immunity' idea made much sense in the first place. Fordow is under IAEA safeguards monitoring, so any attempt to \"break out\" and enrich to weapons grade would be flagged in advance. As there is no sign that Fordow is being fortified any further, the immunity of the programme does not seem to change. The 'zone of immunity' concept, Joshi says, should be 'understood primarily as a rhetorical device', and that rhetoric - this week at least - is sounding increasingly hollow.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ollyofficial\" title=\"\">Olly Murs</a> surely daydreams about the day he'll assume <a href=\"http://www.ollymurs.com/gb/news/post/olly_models_farrell1\" title=\"\">Robbie Williams' mantle</a>, a presumption that isn't as delusional as it sounds. Like Williams, he's made a career that relies as much on chappiness as it does singing, and, if this iTunes festival gig is typical, he appeals equally to young girls and the elders who control the purse-strings. Both his albums have reached No 1, and he's announced his second arena tour.</p> <p>But it's <a href=\"http://www.peterandre.com/\" title=\"\">Peter Andre</a>, not Williams, who comes to mind \u2013 and not solely because he chirps the chorus of the former's Mysterious Girl while reminiscing about the Essex pubs in which he sang before he appeared on the 2009 X&nbsp;Factor. Murs offers a slick, impersonal \"family show\" (his words) that posits him as the kind of celeb who would cheerfully abseil down Canary Wharf as&nbsp;long as the cameras were there. He dances on one leg, slaps his own behind and even does press-ups.</p> <p>Cheeky chappie he may be, but he's the sort who represses any vulnerability, even during a trio of songs that must mean a lot to him. The desolate soft rocker <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZewiUF0uAA\" title=\"\">This Song Is About You</a> is dedicated to his brother, who \"sold a really horrible story about me to the tabloids\"; I Don't Love You Too is about his grandparents' fraught marriage, and Please Don't Let Me Go was inspired by being dumped by a girlfriend during his first flush of X Factor fame. But such glimpses into his personal life are neutered by his show-must-go-on chirpiness. Nobody expects him to be Leonard Cohen, but Murs's perpetual good cheer makes it hard to engage with him.</p> <p>The upside is that he's a pleasantly breezy pop-ska singer, and it would have been a hard soul who didn't jiggle a bit to a finale of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5dFe-WKuPs\" title=\"\">Heart Skips a Beat</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/07/are-we-stuck-in-filter-bubbles-here-are-five-potential-paths-out/\" title=\"\">Are we stuck in filter bubbles?</a> Should we worry that the internet will end up telling us only what we want to hear? From Twitter streams to personal news feeds, we've become experts at sourcing only the content that is most relevant to our particular interests, but some commentators worry that our personalised content feeds can only tell us so much of a news story.</p> <p>How can publishers and media organisations become more transparent in their content delivery? How can it be delivered so that we avoid 'filter bubbles' and an unbalance of news?</p> <p>Here are all the best views from the panel in our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/aug/29/personalised-web-content-news-delivery-filter-bubbles\" title=\"\">live Q&amp;A</a> on the topic of the personalisation of the web and how it affects news readers, journalists, publishers and society as a whole.</p> <h2>Malcolm Coles, product director, Trinity Mirror \u2013 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/malcolmcoles\" title=\"\">@malcolmcoles</a></h2> <p><strong>Personalisation for publishers:</strong> I'm a big fan of personalisation. Like most news sites, we publish hundreds of articles a day. Surfacing them is a big problem \u2014 and personalisation addresses it. We ran some A/B tests, turning off personalisation for people who were getting it before, and found that personalisation means people spend longer on site.</p> <p><strong>Curation:</strong> I had an interesting chat the other day with some American news editors, who said they would never personalise the top of their home / channel pages because it was important that the brand be expressed through their curation decisions. But this assumes that there is one monolithic brand controlled by us at HQ. In practice, readers' views of the brand are likely to be different. A celebrity news reader of the Mirror is likely to see it in a very different light to a football news reader. So personalisation allows us to reflect each readers' individual view of the brand back at themselves \u2014 perhaps reinforcing brand loyalty in the long run.</p> <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> I doubt anyone can explain the algorithms in a way we'd find meaningful. Even Google has flip flopped from claiming that its results are objective to subjective. The ultimate test of an algorithm is if you like the results (or rather if you don't dislike them enough to switch to another main source). But even those stuck with a sub-standard algorithm because they don't know of a better one, still probably receive news from other sources.</p> <p><strong>Filter bubbles:</strong> I think the filter bubble is a bit of a myth. Most people in the old days read one newspaper, and no one complained about it then (well, they did, but not with so much angst \u2014 it was just a consumer choice). The internet lets us use data to show people what they are interested in so that they read it, as opposed to showing them stuff they don't care about that they won't read anyway.</p> <h2>Jeff Jarvis, director, Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism, CUNY Graduate School of Journalism \u2013 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jeffjarvis\" title=\"\">@JeffJarvis</a></h2> <p><strong>Personalisation: </strong>The essential problem, I think, is that we in news do not have personal relationships with the people formerly known as readers. Google and Facebook are built to gather and exploit signals for personalisation. Our content is one of those signal generators. But we are not built to do that.</p> <p>The first step has to be to give people a reason \u2014 their reason \u2014 to reveal something about themselves so that we can give them greater relevance in return. The next step is to be able to gather and analyse and act on that data and return that relevance. The next step is to also be able to exploit that economically: to target higher-value advertising or services as well.</p> <p>But above all this, we need to rethink what we do and how we do it. Just taking the content we already make and faux-personalising that (\"oh, you like sports I hear, so here's lots of sports links I hope are relevant\") will not do. We need to rebuild ourselves into platforms for people's information sharing and needs. That's the essence of personalisation. That importantly includes the ability of the public to share what it knows with itself. Then we know what people know and want to know and we can make the connections. That is personalisation.</p> <p><strong>Algorithms that write news stories:</strong> An article is just a form of data (information) visualisation in this context: you can show people a bunch of stats from a sports event or a financial disclosure in a spreadsheet or you can give it to them in the form we're used to \u2013 narrative. When I talked about Narrative Science at a smaller daily paper in the US, the sports editor was not threatened but delighted. He could hand over the \"writing\" of game stories to the algo and then get to the important work of coaxing scintillating quotes out of jocks.</p> <p><strong>Content:</strong> Do we really know what our content is about? Are most newspapers geocoding their stories so they could be served geographically (via maps or mobile)? Do we know the topicality of a story (is an injured-player story about sports or health?). If you're going to take the signals you get from the public and try to give them relevance back, you also have to understand your content fully.</p> <p>Further, the article may not be the best form for serving that relevant information. Here, I argue that we need to look at articles as assets and paths through them. That's another form of personalisation: <a href=\"http://buzzmachine.com/2012/05/26/news-articles-assets-paths\" title=\"\">different paths through the same set of information based on what you already know or want to know</a>.</p> <h2>Mary Hamilton, deputy SEO editor for theguardian.com \u2013 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/newsmary\" title=\"\">@newsmary </a></h2> <p><strong>Personalisation:</strong> Personalisation is definitely happening; it's always happened, and isn't something to be scared of. Publishers live in an ecosystem on the web where almost every avenue of information gathering is personalised, and people are becoming accustomed to it \u2014 that can make it easier to connect with an existing audience where they are. And publishers like the Mirror who are personalising content for readers on site are seeing increased engagement. Whether that's at the expense of a more fully-informed readership is an open question, and a massive can of worms.</p> <p>We're moving towards an understanding of information as a flow, but this is still very early days for the tech that's being used to make these filters work. Machine learning is only going to get better.</p> <p>Can filters be detrimental to publications? Can it limit reach? At the most basic level, it can make it harder to reach new readers if it's assumed that people mostly want what they already enjoy. Building on what Jeff says above, it also offers an opportunity for people in news production to build more personal connections with readers. If human connection is important to filter bubbles, that can only encourage us to build more relationships around our work.</p> <p><strong>Filtering reader comments:</strong> Personally, I rather like the <a href=\"http://slashdot.org/\" title=\"\">Slashdot system</a>, though it has its issues. It allows comment scoring as well as picking one of four descriptors, which lets readers sort by popular/insightful, or unpopular/funny, so there's lots of choice if you want to dig deeper. <a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/\" title=\"\">StackExchange</a> too is a fairly simple but deep model \u2014 they both also have moderation systems that are really interesting (if you're the sort of person who's interested by moderation systems, that is). I've also been very impressed with the Huffington Post for the way it has used the comment system to foster connections within its community, though I have to say I'm not a massive fan of the points-and-badges gamification approach.</p> <p><strong>Filter bubbles:</strong> I don't think the filter bubble is a myth, but I do think it's a new name for an old phenomenon. Back in the days when people read one newspaper, they trusted an editor to filter the world for them. Now, people trust Facebook, or Google, to filter their world \u2013 or they don't trust them, but it happens anyway. In the old days, if you didn't like the way your newspaper editor was filtering the world, you could choose a different paper, or at least buy another one or check the TV news for a different view. But it's much harder to use a different Google or Facebook, and requires much bigger change for the user.</p> <p>Plus there's the data issue. Newspaper editors don't generally use the contents of your email account or your friends's phone numbers to decide which stories to put in your paper; there are some legitimate concerns about that aspect of the filtration process, if it makes sense to call it that.</p> <h2>Sarah Marshall, technology editor, Journalism.co.uk \u2013 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/SarahMarshall3\" title=\"\">@SarahMarshall3</a></h2> <p><strong>Personalisation:</strong> I think personalisation by its very nature 'enlightens and educates' \u2014 or at least provides readers with a bit more info to something they already know about. Give me a headline to a story that I have no interest in and I'm not likely to click it; suggest a topic that I know something about and I'll read the article.</p> <p>Personalisation is good for readers of news sites \u2014 and Facebook and Google \u2014 as it helps filter the noise. I was interested to learn that the Mirror has tested time on site and seen it increase with the level of personalisation.</p> <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Can / will news sites innovate to give readers the flexibility and control the level of personalisation? Transparency is important. I suspect many Google search users, Facebookers and news site readers are unaware they are being delivered personalised news. I am not sure how happy readers would be if they were aware of all the parameters used (or imposed), including geography, age and gender.</p> <h2>Ariel Peled, founder &amp; CEO, PUBLICi \u2013 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/arielpeled\" title=\"\">@ArielPeled </a></h2> <p><strong>Personalisation:</strong> Many readers, specifically at the ages 18-24, use Facebook to personalise their news, registering to niche news providers of their choice. It seems that social is replacing email news updates with Generation Y readers. In my opinion, language bubbles are quite powerful barriers in most non-European countries.</p> <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> An important issue is transparency. You would like to know the algorithms (at least in general) that guide the filtration, otherwise it will be very hard to know if there's a hidden agenda behind the provided filters. One of our main goals at PUBLICi is letting the public decide. However, this opens the door to bias from organised reader groups, thus it's not a perfect solution on its own.</p> <p>Can or will news sites innovate to give readers the flexibility and control the level of personalisation? This is difficult for anyone other than large providers to do. They should also try to prevent over-filtration.</p> <p><strong>Data:</strong> Structuring data is a daunting task that corporations deal with on a daily basis. Getting different departments to agree on semantics is extremely difficult, even with management support. Getting so many independent data owners to agree seems to me like a Herculean effort.</p> <h2>Wilbert Baan, designer, Somehow \u2013 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/wilbertbaan\" title=\"\">@wilbertbaan</a></h2> <p><strong>Filters:</strong> The problem with filtering is that you don't always know it's happening. It's a very difficult concept. We still see information as static, instead of dynamic. A good filter helps with the density of information. This can be technology or people (journalists, teachers, curators). I think we need both. The amount of information at a news organisation is overwhelming. We need filters. News is a river of stories. Newspapers used to make a selection in the evening \u2013 now it's a continuous feed of developing stories. You miss more than you read.</p> <p><strong>Personalisation: </strong>In news it seems to be a good thing. If the filters are right. Technically we're not there yet. We might always need journalists or curators. I think on a wider scale there is a big downside to personalisation. For example, price discrimination based on your virtual identity. A shop can personalise because they know you are willing to pay more because you're using an expensive computer.</p> <p>I think this will lead to a split in how we work with privacy. On one hand we want more privacy on our computers. Think of the changed cookie regulations. On the other hand we are willing to expose more and more on trusted networks or controlled environments, like social networks. Filters are necessary to get the most out of the ever increasing amount of information that is coming to us.</p> <h2>Reader comment from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/ulrikh\" title=\"\">@ulrikh</a></h2> <p><strong>Personalisation: </strong>I see personalisation as potentially holding enormous benefits for the user and ultimately could fundamentally disrupt the way content organisations do business \u2014 that is all my opinion of course. In the mean time, there are ethical, legislative and factual questions to be answered, with regards to user data, with regards to objectivity and agendas and also with regards to the debate on filter bubbles \u2014 a debate that seems vague and not properly firmed up yet.</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>British troops killed 24 unarmed rubber plantation workers, subjected their families to simulated executions, and rounded up women and children during an operation described as a massacre during the anti-communist insurgency in Malaya more than 63 years ago, the high court heard on Tuesday.</p> <p>However, though this account \"could not be the subject of serious doubt\", and though it contradicts claims made by successive British governments, two judges dismissed an attempt by families of the victims to set up a public inquiry into the event.</p> <p>Their lawyers said they would appeal after Sir John Thomas \u2013 president of the high court's Queen's bench division \u2013 and Mr Justice Treacy ruled that it would be \"very difficult at this point in time\" to establish whether the shootings were \"deliberate executions\".</p> <p>This was despite their statement earlier in the judgment where they refer to allegations made in 1970 by soldiers that there was a \"deliberate execution of the men and it was 'covered up' by the Scots Guards and British army\". The judges added: \"This is a very serious allegation though one which can properly be made on the evidence.\"</p> <p>They ruled: \"The first matter in relation to the purpose of inquiry is to consider whether it can establish the facts. There are obviously enormous difficulties in conducting an inquiry into a matter that happened over 63 years ago. Most of the contemporary documents are missing and most of those who were engaged are dead. Nor, in our view, would it be any easier to determine whether the use of force was reasonable or proportionate.\"</p> <p>The judges analysed three investigations into the Batang Kali killings \u2013 in the late 1940s, the early 1970s and the mid-1990s. They said victims' relatives had alleged a cover-up in relation to investigations in 1948 and 1970.</p> <p>They said it was difficult to escape the conclusion that between 1993 and 1996 departments of John Major's Conservative government decided to \"progress any inquiries with as much delay as possible\".</p> <p>Since the account of the villagers and five Scots Guardsmen had never been the subject of a \"definitive inquiry\", it was \"now impossible to reach any definitive conclusion as to how the deaths of the inhabitants came about\".</p> <p>John Halford, of the law firm Bindsman, solicitor for the families, said: \"Many of the shameful events at Batang Kali have been firmly established, as has the UK's ongoing legal responsibility for them. If ministers can find the moral courage within themselves to address it, they can do so immediately. If they fail to act decisively to end the ongoing injustices at the heart of this case, the survivors and families of the Batang Kali massacre will continue to pursue legal action and complete the work this court has begun.\"</p> <p>Lim Kok, whose father, Lim Tian Shui, was found beheaded, said: \"Though the&#xa0;court found the government did not need to hold an inquiry on technical grounds, the fact is that the Scots Guards shot innocent civilians, my father included.\"</p> <p>Chong Koon Yin, whose father Chong Voon was also killed during the massacre, said: \"The truth has not been fully revealed. Without a proper inquiry or a proper acceptance of fault, the government held legally responsible for the killing remains unaccountable.\"</p> <p>On 11 December 1948 a patrol of Scots Guards surrounded and entered the village, which lies north of the capital. The male villagers were separated. That evening one of the men was shot by soldiers; the next day a further 23 died. None of the victims was armed and no weapons were found before the killings.</p> <p>The Malaysian relatives' hopes have been boosted by a group of Kenyan survivors, mostly in their 80s, who won the right last summer to sue the British government for damages over claims of torture during the 1950s Mau Mau uprising.</p>",
  "<p>The contrast between the Democrats and Republicans couldn't be sharper when comparing the policy platforms adopted by the two parties at their respective national conventions. But the more revealing comparison is between the <a href=\"http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform\">Democratic party platform of 2012</a> and its 2008 edition.</p> <p>Between the two parties this year, gay marriage, abortion, comprehensive immigration reform, healthcare and welfare spending all offer clear and distinct policy differences. In each case the Democrats are in favour and the Republicans are against.</p> <p>Although the official party platforms carry no real weight, with candidates free to adopt or discard them as they see fit, they do highlight one important point: while the Republican platform differs from that of the official Romney/Ryan ticket positions in a number of places, most notably on abortion, it would be hard to insert a \"Obama-Biden 2012\" bumper sticker between the Democratic platform and the presidential ticket.</p> <p>Aside from the political potshots the Democratic platform aims at Mitt Romney, the most significant new language is in its ringing endorsement of gay marriage, which largely aligns with Barack Obama's own recently changed stance. The 2012 platform reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We support marriage equality and support the movement to secure equal treatment under law for same-sex couples \u2026 We oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed same-sex couples who seek the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples.</p> <p>We support the full repeal of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act [Doma] and the passage of the Respect for Marriage Act.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78283\">That's a shift from the 2008 platform</a>, which skated over the issue with vague language of supporting \"equal responsibility, benefits, and protections\".</p> <p>Under the Obama administration, the department of justice has stopped defending Doma, but there have been no moves towards repealing it. That's unlikely to change soon, barring a dramatic change in the make-up of the House of Representatives.</p> <p>But the 2012 and 2008 editions differ most markedly over national security and civil liberties, especially the closure of the notorious US prison site at Guantanamo Bay; overturning the post 9/11 anti-terrorism laws such as the Patriot Act and trying alleged terrorists through domestic US courts. In 2008 the Democratic party unequivocally stated:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will not ship away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries, or detain without trial or charge prisoners who can and should be brought to justice for their crimes, or maintain a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law.</p> <p>We will respect the time-honored principle of habeas corpus, the seven century-old right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention that was recently reaffirmed by our supreme court.</p> <p>We will close the detention camp in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the location of so many of the worst constitutional abuses in recent years.</p> </blockquote> <p>After struggling and failing to meet his own deadline to close Guant\u00e1namo and move terrorism trials to the mainland, and now influenced perhaps by the unhappy realities of being in office, Obama's policy as laid out in the 2012 platform speaks in measured tones of \"checks and balances\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Advancing our interests may involve new actions and policies to confront threats like terrorism, but the president and the Democratic party believe these practices must always be in line with our Constitution, preserve our people's privacy and civil liberties, and withstand the checks and balances that have served us so well. That is why the president banned torture without exception in his first week in office. That is why we are reforming military commissions to bring them in line with the rule of law. That is why we are substantially reducing the population at Guant\u00e1namo Bay without adding to it.</p> <p>And we remain committed to working with all branches of government to close the prison altogether because it is inconsistent with our national security interests and our values.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/09/democratic-platform-again-seeks-guantanamo-closure-134261.html\">Politico's Josh Gerstein points out</a> that \"aside from the non-specific mention of 'new actions and policies' related to terrorism, there's no explicit reference in the new platform to Obama's dramatically ramped up use of drone strikes to kill suspected terrorists\".</p> <p>On Afghanistan, the 2008 platform's bold talk of educating Afghan girls and rebuilding the country's economy \"from the bottom up\" has disappeared, replaced in the 2012 platform by grim, pragmatic language of reversing the Taliban's momentum and giving Afghans \"the time and space to build the capacity of their security forces\" while preparing for the withdrawal of US forces by 2014.</p> <p>The 2012 platform also responds aggressively to a new threat: the Citizens United supreme court ruling that opened a gusher of untrammeled money into American politics. \"We support campaign finance reform, by constitutional amendment if necessary,\" is the platform position, one that President Obama announced last week.</p> <p>In all, the 2012 Democratic platform is recognisably related to its predecessor but, like the campaign it represents, it is indelibly stamped with the political pragmatism and rolled-back rhetoric of the Obama administration's four years in office.</p>",
  "<p>She lived as the \"godmother of cocaine\", ruthlessly ordering scores of bloody murders and violent revenge attacks as she plotted the course of Miami's infamous drug wars.</p> <p>So it seemed only fitting that the manner of Griselda Blanco's death on Monday reflected the brutality for which she became notorious \u2013 gunned down in the street by a killer on a motorcycle as she left a butcher's shop in her hometown of Medell\u00edn, Colombia.</p> <p>Blanco, 69, was credited with inventing the motorcycle ride-by killing during her years controlling southern Florida's fledgling cocaine trade in the late 70s and early 80s, an era in which she pocketed billions of dollars before being convicted of three murders, including that of a two-year-old boy. Detectives suspected her of dozens more.</p> <p>\"It's some kind of poetic justice that she met an end that she delivered to so many others,\" said Professor Bruce Bagley, head of the University of Miami's department of international studies and author of the book Drug Trafficking in the Americas.</p> <p>\"Here is a woman who made a lot of enemies on her rise and was responsible for the deaths of untold numbers of&#xa0;people.</p> <p>\"She might have retired to Colombia and wasn't anything like the kind of player she was in her early days, but she had lingering enemies almost everywhere you look. What goes around comes around.\"</p> <p>Blanco, who was deported from the US in 2004 after serving almost two decades in jail in New York and Florida for racketeering and murder, became one of Miami's original drugs gangsters as tidal waves of smuggled cocaine swept aside marijuana as the dealers' most profitable commodity.</p> <p>She set up a distribution network across the US that netted her tens of millions of dollars a month, making shipments of more than 1,500kg, and maintained her dominance by building an empire staffed with violent enforcers, who were well rewarded for following her orders to execute rivals at the drop of a hat to and make sure they left, no witnesses.</p> <p>She was also personally involved in developing creative methods to get cocaine into the US, even setting up a lingerie shop in Colombia that produced underwear for export with secret compartments.</p> <p>Her story, which was featured in the 2008 documentary Cocaine Cowboys: Hustlin' with the Godmother, showed that her love of the underworld did not only extend to her drugs activities. A son with her third husband, Dario Sepulveda, was christened Michael Corleone Blanco after the central figure in the Godfather trilogy of mafia movies.</p> <p>Two of her three other sons by her first husband were murdered after entering the family business.</p> <p>Blanco became a widow three times, and remained under suspicion for the deaths of all three husbands. In one notorious episode in 1975, remarkable even among Colombia's hardened drugs criminals for its violence, she confronted her husband and business partner Alberto Bravo in a Bogot\u00e1 nightclub car park over millions of dollars missing from the profits of the cartel they built together.</p> <p>Blanco, then 32, pulled out a pistol, Bravo responded by producing an Uzi submachine gun and after a blazing gun battle he and six bodyguards lay dead. Blanco, who suffered only a minor gunshot wound to the stomach, recovered and soon afterwards moved to Miami, where her body count \u2013 and reputation for ruthlessness \u2013 continued to climb.</p> <p>During her Florida reign of terror she was suspected of responsibility in at least 40 murders, possibly as many as 200, yet was convicted of only three \u2013 two drug dealers who crossed her and a two-year-old boy, Johnny Castro, the son of a former Blanco enforcer, who was shot twice in the head by hitmen as he travelled in his father's car.</p> <p>Blanco's former lieutenant, Jorge Ayala, told police: \"At first she was real mad because we missed the father, but when she heard we had gotten the son by accident, she said she was glad, that they were even.\"</p> <p>She escaped the death penalty on a technicality when Ayala was discredited as a witness after being caught having phone sex with secretaries in the prosecutors' office.</p> <p>Bagley said Blanco, who was shot twice in the head, was likely to become the subject of books or a Hollywood movie.</p> <p>\"She was a pioneer in the sense that she helped to forge and carve out the drugs trade in south Florida and used bloody tactics to do so,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The danger is she will be remembered not for her cold-heartedness and brutality but for being a woman entrepreneur in an emerging field dominated by men.\"</p>",

Sam Raimi's Ghost House Pictures produced the movie, which acquitted itself adequately over a traditionally torpid Labor Day session when minds and bodies are elsewhere.</p> <p>The end of the summer season brings with it more fretting over attendance figures and box-office grosses. We'll get the official summer stats later in the week, but it looks as if cinema admissions and grosses for summer 2012 are a bit below the comparable period in 2011. That said, the year to date appears to be running higher than the same period last year, as a solid winter and good spring got 2012 off to a fine start.</p> <p>Summer highlights were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">The Avengers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140156/spider-man-reboot\" title=\"\">The Amazing Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Legacy</a>. This week, Disney expanded Marvel Studios' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">The Avengers</a> to approximately 1,700 theatres (its 18th weekend), a move that brought in a little more than $1m dollars to push the worldwide running total past $1.5bn. It ranks as the third-biggest movie in history, behind Fox's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131170/avatar\" title=\"\">Avatar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/35417/titanic\" title=\"\">Titanic</a>.</p> <p>Warner Bros' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> was blighted by the Aurora massacre. Audience trepidation about multiplexes hit the movie's domestic gross, with the result that it has reached $433.2m, compared to $533.3m for 2008's The Dark Knight. However, the growth in international box office means that last week The Dark Knight Rises crossed $1bn in worldwide ticket revenues, joining its predecessor and a select band of nine other movies in reaching the milestone. Christopher Nolan's Batman finale returned $577.7m internationally compared to its predecessor's $470m. The latest movie will certainly cross $600m and has amassed more than $30m in its first week in China, where it is locked in a head-to-head battle with Sony's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140156/spider-man-reboot\" title=\"\">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> on roughly the same amount.</p> <p>The latter did excellently for a reboot, taking $259m. The original from Sam Raimi opened a decade ago and reached $403m. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone coaxed more than $475m out of international audiences, which was only bettered by the third movie in Sam Raimi's franchise. Sony top brass are understandably chuffed and a new franchise is born.</p> <p>Universal's R-rated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a> was the breakout hit of the season, just as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142098/bridesmaids\" title=\"\">Bridesmaids</a> was in summer 2011. It has taken $216.1m in North America and more than $382m worldwide. And so another sequel is born. Fox's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> from Ridley Scott fared well enough on $126m in North America and $351m worldwide.</p> <p>Sony's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148835/total-recall\" title=\"\">Total Recall</a>, however, was limp, and has managed only $57m domestically, although it's only a few days away from crossing $100m internationally. Universal's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146760/battleship\" title=\"\">Battleship</a> achieved low theatrical returns and grossed $65m in North America, which is a big flop for an effects-led summer release. The $237m international gross was much better, but overall hasn't been enough to recoup production and marketing costs \u2013 though ancillary platforms (DVD, VoD) will ensure the movie ends up making money.</p> <p>Now begins the autumn season and the cavalcade of Oscar contenders.

  "<p>After a few relatively quiet days on the market, leading shares took a turn for the worse after disappointing US manufacturing data.</p> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> was among the biggest fallers after a hefty downgrade by analysts at Bernstein, which moved its recommendation from outperform to market perform. It forecast continuing revenue declines in Europe - no surprise, given the economic crisis in the eurozone - and said Vodafone's shares were likely to slide in similar fashion, despite the \"tantalising prospect\" of a bid from US partner Verizon at some point.</p> <p>Vodafone fell 4.75p to 178.45p.</p> <p>Overall, the day had seemed to be drifting lower - with investors nervous ahead of the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday - when an unexpected decline in US manufacturing pulled the rug from under the complacent attitude. The US ISM index dipped from 49.8 in July to 49.6, compared to expectations of a slight increase to around 50. An \"inadvertently\" leaked set of UK PMI services numbers - which seemed better than expected - did little to soothe market nerves. So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 86.40 points lower at 5672.01, its biggest one day fall since 23 July.</p> <p>Chip maker <strong>Arm</strong> continued its decline after this week's downgrade from Deutsche Bank, falling another 31.5p to 528p.</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> fell 5.8p to 220.7p after a leading analyst effectively gave up on the business. Ian Gordon at Investec downgraded from buy to hold, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Labour Party adopted D:Ream's hit, \"Things can only get better\" as its campaign tune for the 1997 general election, but it heralded a false dawn. Investors in RBS have had too many false dawns \u2013 \"underlying\" operating profits performing broadly \"in line with expectations\" but continuing to be dwarfed by material negative one-off items, of which there are still more coming down the pipe. Reducing non-core drag softens the blow, but after another modest rally, we throw in the towel. Downgrade to hold.</p> <p>In absolute terms, it remains speculative, and while it still appears moderately cheap as a long-term recovery play, we expect to see better entry levels emerge. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>British Land</strong>, which announced a \u00a3300m convertible bond issue, dropped 14.5p to 527p after UBS moved from buy to neutral following the shares' recent performance.</p> <p>But oil field services provider <strong>Petrofac</strong> was one of just three FTSE 100 companies to buck the downward trend, adding 2p to \u00a315.18 after a positive note from Credit Suisse. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> <p>After a period of weakness we upgrade Petrofac to outperform from neutral, with our target raised to \u00a318 from \u00a317,50. We believe the stock has performed poorly on a lack of project awards over the summer period and elevated expectations for the integrated energy services business. We believe the next few months will be better: awards should step up, thanks to less instability in the Middle East, and the payoff of extensive marketing efforts in southeast Asia and amongst oil majors. There remain a number of risks. However, the stock is now the cheapest on enterprise value/earnings in the European sector, which we regard as extraordinary given the long term track record, and see limited downside. </p> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Ashtead</strong>, which rents out small tools to construction and power generation equipment, added 33.4p to 315.9p after it said first quarter profits jumped 82% to a record \u00a361.4m. A gradual improvement in the US, where it conducts some 80% of its business through its Sunbelt subsidiary, helped offset the difficult conditions in the UK.</p> <p>Drycleaning to facilities management company <strong>Johnson Service Group</strong> closed 2p higher at 30p after an upbeat statement despite a \u00a3500,00 drop in half year profits to \u00a36m as it closed 103 shops after a strategic review. House broker Investec was positive:</p> <blockquote> <p>Johnson Service has delivered a satisfactory overall performance against a difficult trading background. The two main divisions have performed well and whilst dry cleaning has been impacted by a very difficult trading environment, a substantial restructuring of that business will reduce its costs significantly. Helped by recent acquisitions that have integrated well, we are raising our forecasts [with profits up from \u00a314.65m to \u00a315.8m] and maintain our buy recommendation on a business that is lowly rated and has good medium term growth prospects.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, investors in <strong>Chariot Oil and Gas</strong> suffered a rocky ride. The company's shares fell sharply on worries about its Nimrod exploration project offshore Namibia. It had announced the start of drilling on the latest well, Kabeljou, at the end of July, and the market seemed to be unnerved by a lack of news. Analysts at Daniel Stewart said at the time of the July announcement that it would take 60 days to drill, and Chariot reacted to the day's share price fall by saying the results of the well were not yet known. Daniel Stewart, which put a buy recommendation on Chariot in its July note, did warn of the risks:</p> <blockquote> <p>We see the [Kabeljour] results as being the number one upcoming catalytic event for Chariot's share price; in the event of a success we anticipate a dramatic upturn. However, in the event of the well coming up dry, a collapse is more than likely. Chariot ended 21p lower at 100.25p.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>The title is a mite deceptive because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the male writer, not the female characters he created, who really dominates in this revival of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/23/miriam-margolyes-gay-mother-stroke\" title=\"\">Miriam Margolyes</a>' Olivier-winning, one-woman show from 1989, inspired by her love of&nbsp;the novels of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/07/letter-charles-dickens-200th-birthday\" title=\"\">Charles Dickens</a>. Theatre has moved on since 1989, but this kind of singular dash through great&nbsp;works still flourishes.</p> <p>Perhaps it's because we're still fixated by the idea that we can understand literature through biography, and that all authors do is work out personal trauma through the act of writing \u2013 particularly in a world where knowing who a writer slept with often seems to interest us more than the books they write.</p> <p>Shows of this kind sometimes can't quite make up their mind whether they belong in the theatre or a tent at a literary festival. (Radio 4 is probably their natural home.) No matter in this case, though, because Margolyes approaches her task with enormous relish. Her love of Dickens is evident from the moment she steps on stage as Sarah Gamp, the drunken layer-out of corpses from Martin Chuzzlewit. And, of course, the&nbsp;piece follows in the footsteps of&nbsp;Dickens, who loved to perform his own writing in front of a live audience. Margolyes even uses a copy of a reading stand used by the author for his own public performances.</p> <p>The show is at its best when it dispenses with attempts to psychoanalyse Dickens and posit reasons for his obsession with heroines aged 17 (the exact age at which his beloved sister-in-law died in his arms), and allows his glorious characters to speak for themselves. One of the nice things here \u2013 besides Margolyes's generous stage presence \u2013 is that she doesn't just do famed women such as the jilted Miss Havisham from Great Expectations, but also some of the less well-known creations such as Miss Mowcher, the dwarf manicurist from David Copperfield.</p> <p>You get what you pay for: a star name doing an audition in public, albeit one of very high quality. At its best, this show will either send you back to the novels or make you read them for the first time&nbsp;\u2013 although personally I've always rather gone along with Oscar Wilde's opinion that \"it would take a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing\".</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 September 2012. The original quoted Oscar Wilde as laughing at the death of Little Dorrit. That should have been Little Nell, and has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Maria Miller arrives at what was once called the ministry of fun with plenty of work to do.</p> <p>The little known 48-year-old has only a few weeks before she will be handed Lord Justice Leveson's conclusions of his inquiry into press standards and ethics \u2013 and will have to contend with public and industry fallout \u2013 even though the decision as to how to respond to the judge's proposals on the future of newspaper regulation will be taken well above her pay grade.</p> <p>She may also be in the uncomfortable position of being one of the first in government to learn whether Leveson is criticising her predecessor Jeremy Hunt, and front up what is expected to be a governmental decision to respond to calls for press reform by ducking calls for legislation.</p> <p>Her arrival also allows the department to return to normal business after Leveson's examination of Hunt's intensely scrutinised handling of the Murdoch bid for BSkyB \u2013 before the Olympics, decision making at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport had simply seized up.

  "<p>Andrew Mitchell can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/04/andrew-mitchell-justine-greening-uk-development?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">leave the UK's Department for International Development</a> (DfID) with his head held high. He has been a passionate defender of the need for the UK to help people living in poverty around the world, at an economically difficult time when many in his own party \u2013 and beyond \u2013 have demanded the country behave more selfishly.</p> <p>The first task for his successor, former transport secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/justine-greening\" title=\"\">Justine Greening</a>, must be to build on Mitchell's work. She should ensure the UK government maintains its commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas aid by 2013. Next year's budget will reveal whether the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/feb/02/government-backs-away-pledge-aid-law\" title=\"\">government has kept its promise</a> not to balance the UK's books on the backs of the poorest.</p> <p>Aid transforms the lives of millions of people, but alone it will never end poverty. There will never be enough of it. UK development policy must be driven by the principle that our aid should not be needed any more.</p> <p>So next on Greening's list should be a credible DfID exit strategy from aid, a plan that not only delivers value for money for UK taxpayers by attacking the global forces that keep people poor, but also helps developing countries tackle poverty and hunger themselves.</p> <p>Greening should pursue this even as she explains why, in the short-to-medium term, the UK must continue supporting people living in poverty by providing aid.</p> <p>The starting point for an exit strategy has three letters: T, A, X. Developing countries will stop needing aid when they get better at collecting revenue themselves. Today, these countries lose approximately $160bn annually as a result of tax dodging by multinational companies alone, <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/actnow/trace-the-tax/background.aspx\" title=\"\">according to my employer Christian Aid</a>. This is more than the global annual aid budget.</p> <p>Last month, MPs on the House of Commons international development committee <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/news/tax-in-developing-countries-report/\" title=\"\">published a superb report addressing exactly this challenge</a>. As the cross-party committee stated, if developing countries are to emerge from poverty and aid dependency, it is imperative they get better at collecting tax. At present, such countries collect vastly less tax than rich countries as a proportion of their GDP, with obvious \u2013 and appalling \u2013 consequences for public services.</p> <p>One solution, which DfID is already promoting and should do more on, is to support poor countries' tax authorities, which currently face a painfully unequal struggle against the highly-paid accountants and lawyers working for the wealthy and powerful.</p> <p>But that's far from the end of the story. As the MPs also recognised, the UK itself can help fight the damage done by tax dodging in poor countries. Part of the answer is to require multinationals to reveal more about their finances in each country where they operate; another part is to push for international co-operation to end the tax-haven secrecy that currently does so much for tax dodgers, money launderers, and bribe-takers.</p> <p>These reforms are so important for people living in poverty that Greening should champion them as passionately as Mitchell has with aid. But she will need to work with her Treasury and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) colleagues to get them implemented.</p> <p>This will be difficult. There are some powerful interests backing the secretive status quo, and the Treasury and BIS know it. These are the companies that hide money away in tax havens, capitalising on the absence of global rules and the weak governance in poor countries to take money from those who most need it.</p> <p>But without joined-up government, what DfID gives in aid will be outweighed by the money siphoned off by tax-dodgers. This is something that Greening should repeat publicly and often.</p> <p>Of course, we also expect the government to deliver on its 0.7% commitment. This is the right thing to do. It's a promise we made to the world's poorest people, and it needs to be delivered.</p> <p>But aid will only ease hunger and pay for basics such as education and vaccines while rich countries continue to give it. So what we most want from Greening is an intelligent exit strategy from aid, one that allows developing countries to become independent. That strategy should start with tax.</p>",
  "<h2>Best of this week's news</h2> <p>Regular readers of this column will be used to foot-in-mouth remarks from comedians, upsetting interest groups on a weekly basis in the name of publicity. Until now, however, none of them had actually declared war in the most geopolitically sensitive region on Earth. Step forward John Cleese, who is attracting opprobrium for filming <a href=\"http://www.suchsmallportions.com/news/john-cleeses-israeli-nut-ad-endorses-bombing-iran\" title=\"\">an advert in which he plays an Israeli general ordering the bombing of Iran</a>. In the ad, for HaSachar Haole's Sababa Egozim chocoloate spread, Cleese's military man is so moved by that confection's sweet and nutty taste, he shouts out its name \u2013 which translates roughly as \"Let's go nuts!\" His underlings take this to sanction an all-out attack on the enemy, and the ad ends to the sound of missiles being fired. Cleese was reportedly paid $50,000 for the commercial.</p> <p>A more commendable example of Cleese's output also comes to light this week, in the form of a trailer for the Monty Python team's animated film about their late colleague Graham Chapman, <a href=\"http://splitsider.com/2012/08/check-out-the-fun-trippy-trailer-for-graham-chapman-a-liars-autobiography/\" title=\"\">A Liar's Autobiography</a>. The film twins audio recordings Chapman made before his death with new animations, telling the absurdist tale of the comedian's life. In a lively week for fans of 1960s comedy, we also learn that <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/the-establishment-returns-to-soho-8091951.html\" title=\"\">The Establishment Club in Soho</a>, founded in 1961 by satirist Peter Cook as a home to cutting-edge comedy, is to be revived by establishment-baiting actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/sep/18/keith-allen-interview\" title=\"\">Keith Allen</a> and TV producer Victor Lewis-Smith.</p> <p>Back in the 21st century, Armando Iannucci has claimed in an interview with the Radio Times that the US version of The Thick of It was <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/tv-and-radio/sick-of-it-iannucci-blasts-buffoons-behind-us-remake-of-hit-comedy-1-2504436\" title=\"\">ruined by \"buffoons\"</a>. The American TV channel ABC rejected the adaptation after viewing the pilot, and Iannucci admits that \"it was terrible \u2026 conventionally shot and there was no improvisation or swearing. The mistake is to think that because America has this tremendous influence internationally, therefore all Americans are brilliant.\" British TV isn't exactly distinguishing itself either \u2013 at least if Channel 4's Paralympics comedy show <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-last-leg-with-adam-hills\" title=\"\">The Last Leg</a> is anything to go by.

And stop being retarded x.\"</p> <p>Fielding was duly replied to by a certain Miss Spidey, who took umbrage at his Gervais-esque use of language. The comedian \u2013 temporarily abandoning the charming flights of surrealist fancy that made his name \u2013 riposted by calling Miss Spidey a \"dumb fuck\". And, of course, his fans joined in, as Miss Spidey relates on <a href=\"http://spiderplantland.co.uk/noel-fielding-is-a-coward/\" title=\"\">her blog on the subject</a>. \"150+ of his followers decided that I was fair game and started tweeted [sic] some pretty offensive stuff directly at me. A few threatened to have me killed or commit the act themselves \u2026\" <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/noel-fieldings-luxury-comedy\" title=\"\">Luxury Comedy</a>, it wasn't \u2013 as Fielding seemed to recognise, backtracking fast online (\"I guess Twitter is a good idea in concept but not in reality\") and insisting that \"I literally meant retarded in the sense of slow or delayed thinking\".</p> <h2>Over to you \u2013 my pick of the week's reader comments</h2> <p>John Harris's article on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/02/frankie-boyle-pseudo-media-storm\" title=\"\">row over Frankie Boyle's Paralympics remarks</a> prompted a predictably lively response, including these thoughts from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18042408\" title=\"\">malasangra</a>.</p> <blockquote> A good [article], but one that isn't likely to be heard by the newspaper industry which makes its living from manufacturing pompous faux outrage. All newspapers need somebody to be angry about. Boyle is just providing them with the material they want and making a lot of money out of the \"bad boy comedian\" image it helps maintain. <br> I like \"edgy\", iconoclastic humour. I laughed out loud at some of his naughtier jokes on Mock the Week, but I was deeply disappointed when I sat down to <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/frankie-boyles-tramadol-nights\" title=\"\">Tramadol Nights</a> and realised that tasteless shock factor jokes were all he had. The future looks bleak for him, because most of his fan base will have finished puberty and started maturing into adults within a couple of years. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/30/comedy-gold-tim-minchin\" title=\"\">Leo Benedictus's overview of the comedy of Tim Minchin</a> sparked a debate as to where Minchin stood in relation to old-school musical comics, such as Tom Lehrer. According to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18002388\" title=\"\">bachemobile</a> :</p> <blockquote> Purely in terms of pianistic technique, Minchin's probably more proficient at the fiddly bits than Lehrer, but that's not really the point of songwriting, and certainly not comic songwriting. Lehrer's great strength IMO (and one of the reasons he'll still be listened to years from now) is his ability to gel together music and lyrics/message: Oediupus Rex would only be half as funny without the incongruous accompaniment. <br> Plus his tunes are memorable in their own right (if only because he ripped them off from the styles he was satirising: I was humming I Wanna Get Back to Dixie just the other day!  On the other hand, the Minchin songs I've heard, while amusing, haven't stuck with me as much as the TL ones, I think because the songs lack the same hooks and easy memorability. </blockquote> <p>Finally, readers had their say on TV's latest contributions to the nation's gaiety, after Sam Wollaston's reviews of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/28/hunderby-harrys-mountain-heroes\" title=\"\">Julia Davis's Hunderby and Adil Ray's much-discussed Citizen Khan</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17944024\" title=\"\">Plankton</a> had this to say about the former:</p> <blockquote> Hunderby was *brilliant*, it managed to out period drama pretty much every period drama for quite some time without even trying to! Perfect casting, sets, costumes etc and the humour was so underplayed and subtle it was a refreshing change from Julia Davis whom I love, but sometimes takes a joke too far. It was very, very clever to get all the performances and direction pitch perfect, as a few inches to the left and it's a French &amp; Saunders sketch with buxom wenches and \"But Sire!\" Oh, it was *brilliant*. I'm tuning in for the drama as much as the comedy, it reminds me of Green Wing in that respect. Can't wait for episode 2! </blockquote> <p>But that French and Saunders comparison was just the problem for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17959482\" title=\"\">SirJohnDanvers</a>:</p> <blockquote> If Hunderby had been written by French and Saunders (who did this kind of thing 20 yrs ago) the Guardian would wretch [sic] all over it. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17948253\" title=\"\">CaptainJory</a> dismissed Citizen Khan in terms that were widely echoed elsewhere:</p> <blockquote> I had been looking forward to Citizen Khan but it was a real let-down, although not entirely unexpected having watched the trailer. About 30 years too late, both in terms of its predictable jokes and its observations of British Asian life. I really don't understand what it was trying to achieve by regurgitating stereotypes that don't apply any more. The plastic sofa covers, the old Merc, etc, etc, none of this is particularly relevant now. Good job in feeding age-old misconceptions. <br> It was painfully unfunny and full of jokes that have been done to death before; parking in a disabled bay then hobbling off, accidentally speaking over the tannoy, forgetting to book the wedding venue, the favourite daughter who pretends to be good, etc, etc. I wonder what we'll get next week, some curry jokes, a mother-in-law, some Bollywood-style dancing perhaps. </blockquote>",
  "<p>Imagine the scene. The female policy adviser brought in to advise David Cameron on his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/oct/02/reality-check-coalition-losing-women-voters\" title=\"\">\"problem with women\" </a>tells him what they want from his first reshuffle: \"Get rid of a couple of the most senior women for a start,\" she says, \"then promote one woman to cover all those pesky media and sports problems as well as women and equalities. Oh, and make sure she is opposed to abortions and gay marriage while you're there. That should do the trick.\" </p> <p>Sadly, this isn't a scene from the new series of The Thick of It but, judging by the government reshuffle, probable advice.</p> <p>The leaked internal note that led to the appointment of a special adviser on women in the first place suggested that both personnel and policies were an issue when it came to the declining support for Cameron among women. Too much policy was being presented by white men in suits and the policies themselves were hurting women, particularly poor ones. But with his first major shuffle Cameron has failed both to improve the number of women in government and to offer support for the policies that matter to many of them.</p> <p>First of all, he has got rid of two of five of his female cabinet ministers \u2013 Caroline Spelman and Cheryl Gillan \u2013 and made Baroness Warsi (female, Asian and, my God, working class) even more the Tory token that she is by keeping her in the cabinet but without a proper job. In contrast, just one of the 19 men were shown the door, Sir George Young.</p> <p>Policy is always going to be more important than personnel, but to end the day with fewer women than the handful he started out with seems a tad careless.</p> <p>Some of those close to No 10 suggest that the next round of junior job announcement expected later today will favour more women, even those brought in as part of Cameron's controversial A-lists of 2010.</p> <p>Even so, it's hard to see how his first reshuffle takes Cameron any closer to fulfilling his pre-election pledge to appoint a third of his first government's jobs to women. Prior to today's changes just one in six ministers were women (21 of 121, including whips).</p> <p>There is of course <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/04/maria-miller-culture-secretary-cabinet-reshuffle?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the appointment of Maria Miller as both culture secretary and minister in charge of women and equalities</a>. (She has previously been the disability minister, a job obviously so well handled by this party loyalist that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/03/george-osborne-booed-paralympics\" title=\"\">chancellor of the exchequer was booed at the Paralympics</a>.)</p> <p>Admittedly, the government equalities office has been a bit of an orphan since birth, going to the ministers (Harriet Harman under Labour then Theresa May as the coalition's first home secretary) who most wanted to foster it. Yet such a surprise was it that it was being moved to the department for culture, media and sports that no one at the Home Office seemed to know what was happening a few hours after the news was announced.</p> <p>So, has Miller shown a keen interest in equalities to date? Cameron and his advisers must have looked at <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/People/Members_of_Parliament/Miller_Maria.aspx\" title=\"\">its own party website</a> and seen that this \"mother of three ... brings her experience as a working mother and in business to all aspects of her political work\". She has also worked in the education department and was shadow minister for the family.</p> <p><a href=\"http://skeptical-voter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Maria_Miller\" title=\"\">She also voted</a> for the proposal to stop abortion providers counselling women with unwanted pregnancies proposed by Nadine Dorries's amendment to the health and social care bill last year, and in 2008 this MP for Basingstoke <a href=\"http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpn=Maria_Miller&amp;mpc=Basingstoke&amp;house=commons&amp;dmp=813\" title=\"\">voted for the abortion time limit to be lowered to 20 weeks</a> against current scientific and medical consensus.</p> <p>She has also voted against gay marriage. As Chris Grayling was appointed justice secretary and Jeremy Hunt put in charge of health, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thefworduk\" title=\"\">@thefworduk</a>, the Twitter account of the <a href=\"http://www.thefword.org.uk/\" title=\"\">FWord</a> feminist website, tweeted: \"a homophobe in charge of justice, an anti-choice in charge of health...#keepshuffling\".</p> <p>Cameron was advised in opposition to reach beyond the Tory party's \"core\" vote towards more women, minorities, even more non-southern rich people. Ceri Goddard, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, had hoped the reshuffle was a \"golden opportunity for the prime minister to boost the present and influence of women in British politics\". Even with a few newbies appointed later today, that opportunity looks to have been lost.</p>",

  "<p>There was a time when every reshuffle was instantly appraised for what it said about the left-right balance of a government. When, for example, Tony Benn was ousted from the department for industry in 1975, and when Margaret Thatcher began culling wets a few years later, both developments were conceived as representing a lurch to the right. Such language might seem rather old fashioned today, in the long shadow of the avowedly post-ideological Tony Blair, but that is perhaps a shame. If we trace together all the paths that ministers are taking in and out of No 10 today I believe \u2013 in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/04/reshuffle-all-you-want-westminster-minister\" title=\"\">contrast to Daniel Hannan</a> \u2013 that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-coalition-cameron-data\" title=\"\">what we are seeing</a> is indeed a great trek to the right.</p> <p>There is of course no change at the Treasury \u2013 the man whose pre-Keynesian prejudices sank Britain into an unexpectedly deep double dip remains safe behind the chancellor's desk. George Osborne is not without pragmatism, and he is currently scrambling around increasingly desperately for PFI-type schemes that might allow a measure of Keynes without scaring the accountants and credit-raters whom he appointed as the referees of his policy. But to keep them happy he is going to have to stick pretty close to his failing plan A, a plan that implies that most of the ministers appointed today are going to have to make cuts for years to come, irrespective of how socially concerned they may be.</p> <p>That much is familiar, but it is worth restating as it sets the frame for everything else the government does, as it has since the coalition was formed. But during its first flush, the coalition could at least claim to offer something distinct, even progressive, within these constraints. The rhetoric of liberty, moves to curb the slow drift towards mass incarceration, real environmentalism, the promise of a new politics \u2013 all of these were distinctive not only from Thatcherism, but also from New Labour. And they persuaded the Liberal Democrats that they really had succeeded in bringing something distinctive to the cabinet table. After today's reshuffle to the right, all these things lie in tatters.</p> <p>One of the most significant appointments is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/chris-grayling-jeremy-hunt-reshuffle?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">replacement</a> of the liberally minded Ken Clarke at the Ministry of Justice. Grayling has moved an awfully long way since he was a member of the SDP, having made the news in recent years for championing compulsory unpaid work experience for benefit claimants, and for questioning laws that required bed and breakfasts to accommodate gay couples. On human rights, Clarke was adamant that any reform would have to respect the European convention on human rights, whereas Grayling has previously said he would like to \"tear up\" the Human Rights Act that codifies that convention. On prisons, where Clarke set out specific plans to curb the prison population by reducing recourse to custody, Grayling used his tenure as shadow home secretary in 2009 to propose yet another prison-building programme.</p> <p>The coalition once promised A New Politics. After the failure of, first, the alternative vote and then \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/03/nick-clegg-ends-agreement-on-mps-cull?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg confirmed only yesterday</a> \u2013 also of Lords reform, the only man who can really claimed to have delivered on that is the Tory moderate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeyoung\" title=\"\">George Young</a>. As leader of the House of Commons, he drove through a range of reforms to the way that parliament's lower chamber works which gave backbenchers more voice and a little more control. His replacement by the failed health secretary Andrew Lansley, who has no particular record of interest in democratic reform, suggests we should not hold our breaths for any more of it.</p> <p>The extraordinary jettisoning of the capable Justine Greening from transport, after less than a year in the job, can only be explained by her spirited resistance to the environmentally disastrous option of expanding Heathrow. Boris Johnson wasted no time in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/04/cameron-reshuffle-government-politics-live#block-5045f7ea58f923c82113b8d3\" title=\"\">pointing this out</a>, embarrassing David Cameron who had once made such sanctimonious play of resisting this polluting policy. But it is even more troubling for any Lib Dem who sincerely believed the talk about this being the greenest government ever. Other arguably troubling signs include the dismissal of Lady Warsi from party co-chair, a Tory traditionalist in many respects, but a Muslim woman whose very presence at the top table was at least a reflection of modern Britain's diversity, and one who occasionally made brave stands for multiculturalism.</p> <p>The most breathtaking appointment of the lot, however, is the dispatching of the semi-disgraced Jeremy Hunt to the Department of Health. No one will mourn the loss of the marketopian technocrat, Lansley, but \u2013 after the ruinous fall-out from his health shakeup \u2013 the challenge for the government here was surely to re-establish trust. But instead Cameron has appointed someone who is mistrusted before he even begins, because of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/24/hunt-cameron-bskyb-bid-decision\" title=\"\">close connection</a> to corporate power as embodied in Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Already-strong suspicions that the baffling Lansley NHS architecture of commissioning consortiums, willing providers and clinical senates is nothing more than a ramp for privatisation will only be redoubled. The coalition agreement waffle \u2013 about respecting the public service ethos, and trusting professionals \u2013 is exposed as utter cant.</p> <p>So, what is left of the claimed liberal promise of this government? As I write, the one clear bit of news from the Liberal Democrat camp is that coalition-enthusiast David Laws is to return to serve as some sort of underling to Michael Gove, becoming an able cheerleader for a free schools policy whose direction and indeed delivery are already under way, and which is \u2013 to my mind \u2013 more Conservative than liberal. If that is the extent of the Lib Dem answer to the unsettling questions raised by Cameron's shuffle to the right, then it really is time for the party to ask itself: what is left?</p>",

  "<p>We all knew it was going to happen sooner or later. When Tony Blair sacked Lord Irvine as lord chancellor nine years ago, launching the back-of-an-envelope bombshell that was later refined into the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Constitutional Reform Act 2005</a>, we realised straight away that Irvine's successors <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1432858/Blair-casts-aside-legal-history-in-radical-reshuffle.html\" title=\"\">would no longer need to be lawyers</a>. That blow was softened by the successive appointments of Lord Falconer, Jack Straw and Ken Clarke. All had been called to the bar. Falconer and Clarke were successful QCs.</p> <p>Although Straw moved quickly into full-time politics, he never lost his respect for the profession he had joined. Clarke, in particular, got on well with Lord Judge, the lord chief justice, whom he knew when both were young jobbing barristers in the Midlands.</p> <p>Now, in Chris Grayling, we have a lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice whose main qualifications for a post that has existed for 1,400 years are that he is perceived to be right-wing and once shadowed prisons.</p> <p>Does that matter? After all, the lord chancellor no longer sits as a judge in the UK's highest court \u2014 as Irvine did by virtue of his office. He no longer even appoints the judges - though <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2012-2013/0004/lbill_2012-20130004_en_19.htm\" title=\"\">legislation currently before parliament</a> would give him a say in the two most senior appointments. And he must <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/4/section/17\" title=\"\">swear an oath</a> both to defend the independence of the judiciary and make sure there are \"resources for the efficient and effective support of the courts\" \u2014 whatever that may mean.</p> <p>Of course, nobody would expect the health secretary to be a doctor, the education secretary to be a teacher or the Northern Ireland secretary to be Irish. You might even regard it as positively undesirable for a minister to be associated with the profession he or she has to work with.</p> <p>But it matters very much indeed. Grayling is not only the first non-lawyer to become lord chancellor in modern times. He is also the first holder of that office who might reasonably regard himself as on the way up in politics; it was because the role was always seen as a retirement job that it used to carry such an attractive pension. If Grayling is looking to advance his career, or even the prospects of his party at the next election, he will find there are easy headlines to be won by attacking the judges for being soft on sentencing or for upholding the human rights of unpopular members of society.</p> <p>That would make it much harder for Grayling to achieve the effective working relationship that the he needs to have with the lord chief justice. There are many responsibilities in which the two of them must concur. To take just one example, the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 gives the lord chief justice and the lord chancellor joint responsibility for dealing with complaints against judges. Acting together, they have the <a href=\"http://judicialcomplaints.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/Magistrate_Miss_Michelle_Martin_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_2312.pdf\" title=\"\">power to sack certain judicial office-holders</a>. Even the <a href=\"http://judicialcomplaints.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/Lord_Justice_Thorpe_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_0112.pdf\" title=\"\">most senior can be reprimanded</a>. There is certainly scope for mischief here.</p> <p>No doubt Grayling will tell us that he would be guided by the lord chief justice on such matters. That may be wise; but it is not what parliament intended. The lord chancellor should not be a rubber stamp. Getting the balance right is going to be much harder for a non-lawyer to achieve, even with the support of his officials.</p> <p>Tim Dutton QC, former chairman of the bar, <a href=\"http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/news/2202704/clarke-replaced-by-grayling-as-justice-secretary-in-reshuffle\" title=\"\">said on Tuesday</a> that the new justice secretary must fight hard for all the elements that make up the rule of law. An instinctive grasp of that elusive concept may not come easily to a non-lawyer. Even more difficult for Grayling will be balancing his responsibilities for prisons with his responsibilities for the judges who send people there and for paying enough money to the lawyers whose job it is to ensure that people are not wrongly imprisoned. It's a much more demanding job than he might imagine.</p> <p>Dominic Grieve is very well suited to the post of attorney general and I am not surprised to see him remaining in that post instead of succeeding Clarke. If Grieve had become justice secretary, Edward Garnier, the solicitor general, might have moved up a rung and become attorney general. As it is, Garnier is now out of a job.</p> <p>This is a pity, although Garnier always gave the impression that he was rather surprised to be in the government in the first place. Perhaps he was just too laid back and charming.</p> <p>His successor, Oliver Heald, is equally charming, but perhaps rather more Conservative. Heald practised at the bar for more than 20 years, but moved into politics before reaching the stage at which he would have become a QC. Perhaps for this reason, neither he nor - I suspect anyone else - was expecting him to become one of the government's law officers.</p> <p>Under Labour, the post of solicitor general was sometimes held by MPs who were politicians first and lawyers second. Whether you regard that as a wise approach rather depends on whether you want the solicitor general to be the cabinet's second most senior legal adviser or to be a backbench MP who can promote reforms such as the deferred prosecution agreements that Garnier has been pushing for.</p> <p>Whichever way you look at it though, there has been a distinct shift to the right among holders of the key legal posts in government, just as there has been within the government as a whole. Legal politics are beginning to look interesting.</p>",
  "<p>It was a cry, raw and anguished, that pierced the convivial party atmosphere and laid bare the sense of anomie gnawing away at South Africa.</p> <p>The archbishop emeritus Desmond Tutu had an emotional outburst on Monday night as he castigated politicians for greed, failing schools and the \"nightmare\" of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/south-african-police-shoot-striking-miners\" title=\"\">Marikana mine massacre</a>.

Can't you allow us elders to go to our graves with a smile, knowing that this is a good country? Because truly \u2013 it is a good country.\"</p> <p>Tutu, a Nobel peace laureate described as the moral conscience of South Africa, has not been afraid to criticise the governing African National Congress (ANC), for example over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/04/tutu-attacks-anc-dalai-lama-visa\" title=\"\">refusal to grant the Dalai Lama an entrance visa</a>.</p> <p>On Monday he was at the District Six museum for the launch of the struggle veteran Michael Lapsley's book Redeeming the Past, along with guests including Marius Fransman, the deputy foreign minister, and other high-ranking figures.</p> <p>Lapsley was an ANC chaplain who lost an eye and both hands to a parcel bomb sent by the apartheid regime. Later, speaking from the podium, Tutu expressed frustration at the betrayal of such sacrifices after the dawn of multiracial democracy in 1994.</p> <p>\"Is this the kind of freedom people were tortured and people were maimed for?\" he was quoted as saying. \"I ask myself, why were we in the struggle? The highest price was paid for freedom, but are we treating it as something precious?</p> <p>\"How can we have children 18 years later who go to school under trees and whose <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-07-30-anc-government-textbook-failure\" title=\"\">education is being crushed</a> without textbooks and no one is held accountable?

In a democracy? In a new South Africa? Have we forgotten so soon? Marikana felt like a nightmare, but that is what our democracy is in 2012.\"</p> <p>The Marikana tragedy, in which police gunned down 34 striking mineworkers, has been <a href=\"http://www.shanduka.co.za/news-releases/WHAT-WE-DO-NOW-WILL-DEFINE-US-AS-A-NATION/index.html?&amp;re=1\" title=\"\">described as probably the lowest point in South Africa's short post-apartheid history</a> and prompted much soul-searching in the economically divided nation.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Tutu caused controversy when he accused <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/tony-blair-iraq-war-desmond-tutu\" title=\"\">Tony Blair and George Bush of lying over weapons of mass destruction</a> in Iraq and called for them to answer charges of war crimes.</p>",

Of course, wondering about the world isn't exactly new. Our natural <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/occams-corner/2012/aug/09/mars-curiosity-nuclear-tweet\">curiosity</a> has always been there, but it's just that in the past, God (or gods) got most of the credit. From Descartes to Dawkins \u2013 whether it's part of God's greater plan, or a gene that is indeed selfish \u2013 science is often seen as mystical by those who practise it. </p> <p>This is actually not what science <em>is</em> but rather what some like to <em>think</em> science is, so perhaps we should call it Science. Seeing science as Science is further exacerbated by some science pundits, such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/aug/31/the-selfish-gene-richard-dawkins-review\">Richard Dawkins</a>, who hold up Science as an opposing force to religion, rendering the scientific endeavour mystical to the general world: Science as God's \"rational\" opponent.</p> <p>But this doesn't really work. It's like saying oranges are an opponent of Obama or that that you can oppose \"hate\" with logic. This false opposition is the fundamental problem with creationism (or intelligent design if you are a neo-conservative), both of which are pseudosciences based on God's plan. Setting up Science as the opponent of religion has the same fundamental problem: it becomes a pseudo-religion based on science. Science with a capital S would assert that science can explain (or will ultimately explain) everything \u2013 we just need the time to get there. However, this stance is faith, not science, or rather \"faith in science\", which is not science but a belief.</p> <p>Science is instead a way to logically explain observed natural phenomena \u2013 a human construct based on observable phenomena and not belief. Nature <em>is</em>, and science is how we try to describe it. Clouds exist; meteorology is the science of figuring out what they are and how they affect the weather. This has nothing to do with belief. If you do want to use Science as a belief system, it doesn't work very well.</p> <p>Science does not provide a final, ultimate <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/occams-corner/2012/aug/31/truth-religion-science-fiction\">truth</a> as many belief systems claim to do. Science is, in fact, defined by change. </p> <p>Scientific theories are educated, logical guesses at explaining observed physical phenomena and a scientific law is just the sum of our experience of a particular phenomenon, appropriately rationalised. With new observations, old theories are proved to be consistent, are modified or are completely discarded. </p> <p>Scientific laws don't get off the hook either. All a scientific law means is that there has never been an instance when anyone has observed anything different \u2013 until they do, then laws too are subject to change. Many ancient societies thought that the Earth was flat and the sky was a bowl, which isn't a bad theory given the observables back in the day. The Earth looks pretty flat locally and the sky does look like a bowl. But now we know the Earth is an orb and the sky is most decidedly not an upside-down bowl. And how do we know?</p> <p>New observations leading to new theories. This is science. </p> <p>Both famous and not-so-famous scientists often purport that Science is the ultimate purveyor of truth, which does not help to demystify the scientific endeavour. The illustrious Lord Kelvin certainly thought science had it all wrapped up in 1900, when he famously proclaimed: <a href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Kelvin.html\"><em>\"There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now.\"</em></a> </p> <p>Thankfully for us, Einstein and his partners in crime didn't listen. </p> <p>I am sure that Dawkins himself would argue against this accusation of setting science up as a pseudo-religion. Judging from his usual arguments, he would likely say something along the lines of science is evidence-based and rational and religion is irrational. Setting aside the dubious assertion that religion is irrational, a belief that Science can solve everything and tell us the ultimate answer is equally irrational. Science is not, and can never be, the final arbiter of truth. There are always new pesky observables popping up capable of ruining any theory. </p> <p>The practice of science is based on evidence and observable facts; it is a decidedly human attempt at understanding observations within the framework of what it can measure, test and observe. The framework itself limits science as a final arbiter of truth. </p> <p>In an age when rational thinking and science are sometimes lauded as a fixed point of truth, it is wise to remember that science is not mystical \u2013 it's actually something anyone can do. The cool thing about science is exactly that: science does not transcend human understanding but it is ever moving and adapting. It is plastic and malleable, mutable and changeable and at its best is an honest search for knowledge of the natural world.</p>",

  "<p>Freiburg in southern Germany is a remarkable place. It has a population of 240,000 and keeps winning prizes and accolades for its high quality of life. This achievement manifests itself in low levels of congestion and pollution, high levels of cycling, highly integrated and high quality bus, rail and tram services, high levels of renewable energy from sun and wind, internationally acclaimed car-free residential areas and huge success in job creation related to research and development and renewable energy. The problems that most similar UK cities face simply do not exist in Freiburg.</p> <p>Arriving at the main railway station provides direct access to the main bus station, a major tram stop and a cycling hub where bikes can be hired, parked and repaired. Public transport tickets cover the whole network and moving from tram to bus to local train is so easy that it makes car use unattractive by comparison.</p> <p>There is no rural transport problem. Buses and trains serve rural areas from very early until late at night and cover a dense network. If you are a visitor staying in the wider region in a hotel or a holiday home you pick up a \"konus card\", which grants free public transport throughout the region. Freiburg has a thriving retail sector in the city centre with no significant development of out-of-town shopping malls.</p> <p>So how does Freiburg achieve all this when UK cities in the main have relatively poor quality public transport and low levels of cycling? Those who live in Freiburg make 28% of all trips every day by bike, while in Manchester the figure is 1%; the car in Freiburg accounts for 30% of all trips every day, when a UK city will see 60% of all trips taken by car.</p> <p>In a recent <a href=\"http://scorecard.inrix.com/scorecard/summary.asp\" title=\"\">international survey of congestion</a>, Britain came out fourth worst out of 25 (only Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands fared worse). Germany was much lower down the list, with lower levels of congestion linked to the significantly higher quality of alternatives to the car.</p> <p>Britain is generally a poor performer on quality of life compared to Germany, Denmark, Switzerland and Austria. If this causes patriotic alarm, the antidote is to visit Freiburg, Copenhagen, Lund, Delft or Groningen where the many delights of moving around and enjoying high quality spaces can soak in and stimulate a desire to improve.</p> <p>Poor performance in Britain goes wider and deeper than just transport and public realm; it embraces child and elderly poverty, inequality, obesity and very poor levels of renewable energy.</p> <p>Britain was not always an international laggard; major improvements in sanitation and drinking water improved our largest cities in the closing decades of the 19th century, and after the great smog that killed thousands of Londoners in 1952 we produced clean air legislation.</p> <p>But now we are like rabbits caught in headlights and incapable of sorting out the approximately 20,000 deaths that are attributable to air pollution in the UK every year. Low emission zones can help to tackle this problem, but Britain has only three \u2013 and only one of these impacts on all vehicles \u2013 compared to 47 in German cities. This should be a matter of serious public policy concern.</p> <p>The how and why of Britain's underperformance is the central theme of my new book, <a href=\"http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415509558/\" title=\"\">Quality of Life and Public Management</a>. There is no simple explanation but it can still be found in the underfunding of local government, the over-centralisation of authority in Whitehall, the lack of fit between councillors and the people they represent and the British fetish around economic growth and regeneration that misses so many opportunities to provide by a broader vision.</p> <p>The good news is that we can make a change, and Britain can be in the top rankings of performers.

  "<p>All over Europe the need for new affordable housing \u2013 which was critical even before the current crisis \u2013 is rising. Though in some EU countries house prices have fallen, they have not dropped to a level where they are affordable for the many.</p> <p>With a lack of housing supply at a reasonable price, private landlords are complaining that social landlords are responsible for unfair competition because they receive state aids allowing them to provide housing at lower prices \u2013 the exact purpose for which they are granted public funds.</p> <p>Like other groups in Sweden and the Netherlands, the French federation of private landlords (UNPI) has made a formal complaint to the European Commission, citing unfair competition due to \"overcompensation\" received in form of state support for social housing provision. They claim that our sector has a competitive advantage, especially over the business of middle-income households.</p> <p> What is interesting is that, in the case of this complaint, private landlords are not proposing to provide affordable housing for all income groups, but only to \"the top of the low\". They argue that social housing providers should concentrate on very low-income groups, and private landlords should receive state support to offer housing at a discounted price for other groups in need.</p> <p>EU competition law is narrow enough that this kind of complaint can be receivable. It was designed before the housing crisis and is out of date. And if it is up to national governments to decide how to implement the law \u2013 how to define the mission for which a company is receiving state aid \u2013 then the EU rules cannot be adapted to our current economic situation.</p> <p>Similar complaints have been issued in the Netherlands and in Sweden, where both countries chose to reform their rules for state support to affordable housing, the former choosing to apply stricter income ceilings to access social housing and the latter opting to keep universal access to municipal housing but withdraw all forms of state aid.</p> <p>The fact that EU competition rules can have such a profound impact on national housing policy is little understood by citizens, and even by housing providers. These rules are inadequate for today's social housing sector. We strongly advocated for a change in the law earlier this year \u2013 without success \u2013 for two important reasons.</p> <p>Firstly, affordable housing should be part of the solution to the European economic crisis. Social landlords offer housing at a discount to all households that do not find accommodation in the market. To have a real impact on the housing market, it is crucial to have a comprehensive policy which ensures we do not create a split society by contrasting low rent for social tenants against high house prices for owner occupiers.</p> <p>Secondly, in a time of funding cuts the UK government is proposing that social landlords finance their lower rents by providing housing at 80% of the market rent, and others look set to follow their example. What exactly are French private landlords are complaining about? Cross funding is a necessity.</p> <p>So what do social landlords receive state support for? Housing providers are happy to discuss this with all landlords and lobby groups, and most importantly with tenants and consumers. We have always been very clear that any landlord who wants to comply with the obligations we meet over quality, price, tenure and security are more than welcome to work on our side.</p> <p>But this debate begs another question: what is affordable housing? The term, and the concept, is too often misused when so many European households are already overburdened by the cost of accommodation.</p> <p><em>Kurt Eliasson is president and Claire Roumet is secretary general of </em><a href=\"http://www.housingeurope.eu/\" title=\"\"><em>Housing Europe</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Last July three men left their village to hunt. They returned to witness, at a distance, the alleged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/amazon-tribe-massacre-alleged-venezuela?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">murder of their entire community</a>. Men, women and children were killed in an attack that involved crude explosives, executions and a helicopter strafing the village with machine-gun fire. The main building, which served among other things as meeting hall and religious centre, was burnt to the ground. The bodies were cremated, presumably to hide the crime.</p> <p>The village concerned was the <a href=\"http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8626\" title=\"\">remote settlement of Irotatheri</a>, an \"uncontacted\" group of Yanomami native Americans living in the southern Venezuelan state of Amazonas near the border with Brazil. Although it is horrific enough that around 80 people may have died in this brutal assault, the tragedy grows even worse when you realise that this village's entire sub-culture may have been destroyed. Illegal goldminers from Brazil (<em>garimpeiros</em>) who are presumed to have carried out the killings will take advantage of this atrocity to exploit the land in the most destructive fashion.</p> <p>The assault was brought to light by Horonami, a Yanomami umbrella organisation that campaigns to protect indigenous rights. The extreme remoteness of the settlement meant that news of the massacre had taken weeks to reach the outside world. Activists had, however, been able to talk directly to survivors and eyewitnesses, and, although details were still sketchy, the basic events were clear. <a href=\"http://assets.survivalinternational.org/documents/793/declaration-from-indigenous-organizations-of-the-amazon-regarding-the-yanomami-massacre.pdf\" title=\"\">Horonami, along with 15 other indigenous organisations</a>, called for an immediate public investigation.</p> <p>Over the weekend, however, Nicia Maldonado, the Venezuelan minister for indigenous peoples, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/world/americas/no-sign-of-massacre-in-amazon-venezuelan-officials-say.html?_r=2\" title=\"\">gave a statement to the press</a> denying that any such attack had taken place. She says that a committee has surveyed the known Yanomami communities in the area and found no evidence of any such assault \u2013 no eyewitnesses, no burnt longhouse, no bodies. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/world/americas/no-sign-of-massacre-in-amazon-venezuelan-officials-say.html?_r=2\" title=\"\">Additional sources blame initial reports</a> on \"some media outlets and destabilising sectors seeking to generate uncertainty in the population\" \u2013 a sample of <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/news/regions/americas/venezuela/venezuela-chavismo-chavez-capriles\" title=\"\">Chavista</a> rhetoric that suggests the government might have had its own motives not to find evidence of these killings <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-venezuela-amazon-tribebre88300i-20120903,0,2172993.story\" title=\"\">during a survey of millions of acres of thickly forested land that took less than a week</a>.</p> <p>Whether massacre or miscommunication, the context in which this story has emerged reveals why indigenous groups would so readily believe such a killing might take place, and why some communities might choose to remain uncontacted.</p> <p>That term <a href=\"http://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3109-questions-and-answers-uncontacted-tribes\" title=\"\">\"uncontacted\"</a> is often <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/feb/04/amazon-uncontacted-tribe-media-coverage?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">taken somewhat literally</a> and used to present such groups as cut off from the world \u2013 <a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Noble_savage\" title=\"\">noble savages</a> living in primitive and timeless ways. This ignores the fact that these groups are in contact with other indigenous communities \u2013 as can be seen in this case \u2013 and through them <a href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/how-globalization-has-impacted-yanomami-people-6589416.html\" title=\"\">engage in trade and information exchange</a> with the outside world. Moreover, the rhetoric of \"primitive man\" serves a colonial narrative that portrays an uncontacted community using guns or wearing T-shirts as somehow fallen or impure, and as no longer having the inherent rights of the original inhabitants of colonised lands.</p> <p>Naturally, the Yanomami and other indigenous groups have been changed by colonial encounters. There have now been centuries of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_history_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\" title=\"\">new diseases wiping out entire peoples</a>, <a href=\"http://ufam.academia.edu/PatriciaSampaio/Papers/1101410/Native_Americans_I_-_Amazon\" title=\"\">unequal armed conflicts</a>, enslavement and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/24/world/americas/24pope.html\" title=\"\">forced conversion</a>. The Trans-Amazonian highway, pushed through in the 1970s by the military government, has opened up huge areas for exploitation. Despite the best efforts of people such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A2ndido_Rondon\" title=\"\">C\u00e2ndido Rondon</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villas-B%C3%B4as_brothers\" title=\"\">Villas-B\u00f4as brothers</a>, the relationship between the state and its indigenous inhabitants has been one of exploitation and destruction. As with deep settler states as different as <a href=\"http://www3.nfb.ca/enclasse/doclens/visau/index.php?mode=theme&amp;language=english&amp;theme=30662&amp;film=16933&amp;excerpt=612109&amp;submode=about&amp;expmode=2\" title=\"\">Canada</a> and <a href=\"http://www2.brandonu.ca/library/cjns/14.2/hele.pdf\" title=\"\">Russia</a>, indigenous peoples were treated as an obstacle to be bought off or threatened.</p> <p>A gold rush in the late 1980s and 1990s is the most immediate cause to fear outsiders. <a href=\"http://books.google.com.cy/books?id=deb1ixo2MBQC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=yanomami+-tierney+miners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1qopmDcJLV&amp;sig=cyJTMZ3NHGXZ8yDltbvqRokYFjM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wr5DUMSZJvT34QSe24HoCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=el%20dorado&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">As many as 40,000 miners</a>, encouraged by the Brazilian government, entered the territory occupied by 20,000 Yanomami. They poisoned drinking water, raped women, and spread STIs and other diseases. Less than 20 years ago, a group of <em>garimpeiros</em> committed another massacre, killing at least 16 in the village of Haximu. Although some were later imprisoned for genocidal crimes, others escaped scot free. Both Brazil and Venezuela have since taken great strides to incorporate protection of indigenous groups into their constitutions, but in practice they have not prevented such miners continuing to enter and exploit Yanomami territory.</p> <p>A question that is often asked in discussions about indigenous peoples, especially uncontacted groups, is why they don't simply give up and try to prosper in modern technological culture. Aren't they just clinging to traditions out of fear, or to get special treatment? Obviously the most important point is that people should be allowed the right of self-determination; but the history of violence and degradation shown to the Yanomami shows why, for some groups, avoiding contact remains a logical choice.</p> <p>It must be hoped that Nicia Maldonado does not prove them right: either by covering up a terrible crime, or failing to take action against the <em>garimpeiros</em>.</p>",
  "<p>School examination results will always be associated with groups of laughing young girls, the image that inevitably dominates our newspapers and screens on results days. Girls now outstrip boys in the proportion of top grades achieved in all but a handful of subjects at key stage three. Not only are they much more likely to get good grades than boys, they are more likely to take key stage 3 qualifications in the first place.</p> <p>Last year there were 40,000 more female A-level applicants than male. This disparity is especially shocking when you consider that <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/files/39DemandforHEto2029summary.doc\" title=\"\">according to research by the Higher Education Policy Institute</a> there are around 65,000 more boys aged 18 to 20 than girls.</p> <p>It's hardly surprising, then, that female applicants far outnumber male applicants to higher education. <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Documents/PatternsAndTrendsinUKHigherEducation.pdf\" title=\"\">Figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency</a> (HESA) show that female school leavers are 30% more likely to apply to university than male. The Universities UK publication, <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Pages/Publication-294.aspx\" title=\"\">Patterns in UK HE</a>, illustrates the trend very well: the proportion of women undergraduates is around 57%, a gap that has widened every year in recent times.</p> <p>Statistics from the HESA report, <a href=\"http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2411&amp;Itemid=278\" title=\"\">Students in Higher Education Institutions 2010/11</a>, show how wide the gap between men and women students has become in some subject areas. The starkest divide is in veterinary science where women accounted for more than 75% of students. They also made up more than 66% of those studying law and more than 67% taking languages.</p> <p>Figures from the same report also reveal a gender imbalance at individual institutions. Women students outnumber men by three to two in many universities, and in some institutions where there are large teaching or nursing courses by as many as two to one. The gap is less pronounced at many Russell group institutions \u2013 women are still in the minority (just) at Oxford and Cambridge. It will be interesting to see if the unrestricted recruitment of AAB students has affected those numbers in 2012. Girls are far more likely to be in this group than boys. Last year they made up almost 60% of the AAB cohort.</p> <p>This growing gender gap matters and we should take action now to address it, perhaps by finding a way to include boys, particularly those that attend non-selective state schools, in the widening participation agenda. It is clear that the problem is starting at school and I would urge universities to consider tailoring some outreach activities to encourage boys to see higher education as an option and take the A-level or equivalent qualifications needed to apply.</p> <p>Bahram Bekradnia, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI), whose 2009 report is still <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/466-1409/Male-and-female-participation-and-progression-in-Higher-Education.html\" title=\"\">the best commentary on the gender divide, </a> believes addressing gender in widening participation programmes is \"spot on\".</p> <p>\"I made the suggestion myself some time ago but there was strong resistance in HEFCE to doing anything along those lines,\" he says. \"They were very wedded to the assumption that the problem was mainly social class (which it may well be) and were concerned that a focus on gender issues would detract from the bigger problem\"</p> <p>Bekradnia is unconvinced that it is an either/or issue, nor that class issues are more important than gender issues: \"They may be but I don't know the evidence is there. We need to focus our widening participation activity on those matters where we have the biggest problem\".</p> <p>Professor Geoff Whitty, director emeritus at the <a href=\"http://www.ioe.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Institute of Education,</a> also sees merit in the idea: \"Reviewing the literature on the achievement and participation gap recently, I noticed how gender was not seen as the big issue it was when I was first looking at access 30 years ago. But looking at recent statistics, boys \u2013 and not just white working class boys \u2013 may need to become the focus of widening participation activities in the future.\"</p> <p>If access to higher education has become an equality issue for men then access to positions of equal power and pay remain the overwhelming equality issue for women in the UK. <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap/\" title=\"\">According to the World Economic Forum</a>, the UK ranks first in the world for equality in education \u2013 but 33rd for economic equality.</p> <p>It is also a pertinent subject for higher education professionals \u2013 the most read article on the Higher Education Network to date addresses <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/may/24/why-women-leave-academia\" title=\"\">women's reluctance to become research academics and follow a career in academia</a>.

  "<p>Your 24 August issue neatly combines two interconnected issues. Agroforestry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/21/agroforestry-france-farming-revival\" title=\"\">(Planting the trees of life)</a> has long been a strategy practised by smallholder farmers in developing countries. One of the most interesting species being promoted is the so-called fertiliser tree (<em>Faidherbia albida</em>) which, as a legume, not only fixes atmospheric nitrogen, but also draws up essential nutrients. These are returned to the soil as organic matter when the tree that has provided shade throughout the dry season sheds its leaves. It not only fertilises the next crop but also offers no competition for light or water as other tree species do.</p> <p>For long-term sustainability, agroforestry must incorporate conservation practices and so when George Monbiot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/poor-hungry-rich-drive-mo-farah-biofuels\" title=\"\">(Must the poor starve so the rich can drive?)</a> berates the practices of crop residue removal and ploughing grassland, he is on the right track as these are precisely the causes of our dependence on inorganic fertilisers, the destruction of soil biota, and soil erosion. This sort of conservation agriculture is desperately needed throughout the world.</p> <p>In his 17 August <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/05/ruralaffairs-birds\" title=\"\">Nature watch</a>, Mark Cocker lamented the calamitous fall in birds, mammals and insects in our contracting countryside and links it to our ostrich-like obsession with economic growth. All these strands were brought together for me when I recalled a farmer with whom I had worked in Central America. Together we had established tree species along the contours of his steeply sloping fields and these live barriers had checked soil erosion and had built up terraces where rainwater could accumulate. This was all well and permitted two crops a year instead of the usual one.</p> <p>But one of his comments is still with me several decades later. He said that the family had more food and could eat better but, for him, one of the joys was to sit in the shade of the trees that we had planted to watch and listen to the birds that enjoyed the insects, seeds and nesting sites provided. That is the sort of conservationist epiphany that could start us on the road of greater food production coupled with environmental protection. And that it is precisely what we are failing&#xa0;to do.<br><strong>Brian Sims</strong><br>Bedford, UK</p> <p>\u2022 Both George Monbiot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/poor-hungry-rich-drive-mo-farah-biofuels\" title=\"\">(Must the poor drive so the rich can drive?)</a> and Jenna Woginrich <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/american-corn-feed-people-not-cars?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Feed people, not cars, 3 August)</a> see the issue of biofuels vs food in oversimplistic black-and-white terms.

Suppose for argument's sake that Washington does indeed intend to seek Assange's extradition from Sweden to face treason charges. What would it then be most rational for the US to be doing right now? Answer: giving the world \"no serious evidence\" of its intentions, since such evidence could serve only to strengthen international opposition to his being sent to Sweden. Since what they are doing now is exactly what they would be doing if they really did want to extradite him, it is absurd to cite what they are now doing as good reason to believe they have no intention to extradite him. Moreover, if Washington really has no such intention it could clear the air immediately by saying so \u2013 and thereby defuse an embarrassing situation for its ally Britain by removing Assange's only defensible reason for remaining in the Ecuadorean embassy.</p> <p>Overall, the more plausible reading of Washington's silence is that the US will be after him as soon as it can.</p> <p>The Swedish allegations against Assange are another matter. They are serious and warrant investigation. But that is not a good reason for misrepresenting the likelihood of US extradition proceedings, nor a good reason for sending Assange to Sweden regardless of that likelihood. Another way of investigating those allegations will need to be found. <br><strong>Christopher Cordner</strong><br>Melbourne, Australia</p> <p><strong>An issue of human rights</strong></p> <p>While the so-called massacre of South African miners was terrible and extremely regrettable, the police may have acted from fear for their own lives rather than brutal intentions, as seems to be suspected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/17/miners-wives-rage-south-africa-killings?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Wives rage at brutality of Zuma's police after 'massacre' of miners, 24&#xa0;August)</a>.</p> <p>An unfair comparison your article seems to be making is that the protesters had only sticks while the police had guns. The accompanying photograph shows the crowd in possession of pangas, spears and sticks.&#xa0; You may remember the death toll and destruction of a society caused by pangas, spears and sticks in the hands of mobs in Rwanda.</p> <p>Sad and regrettable though the entire incident has been, there appears to have been good reason for the police to be fearful for their lives, given that there were fewer of them and the crowd was becoming increasingly more aggressive as they were closing in. I wonder what other options might be seen to have been open to the police other than to defend themselves with the weapons issued to riot police in South Africa.</p> <p>Police can hardly remain absent and leave aggressive mobs entirely to their own devices. That would be dereliction of duty. By the same token, it would be foolish in the extreme to attempt to defuse the anger of a large armed mob without adequate means of defence.

When, for example, the minority whites of Rhodesia controlled the country, they were internationally vilified by the liberals \u2013 in spite of having created one of Africa's most prosperous countries.</p> <p>The vilification was largely based on the oversimplistic concept of \"white bad, black good\" and ultimately resulted in Robert Mugabe taking power. One of his first actions in 1983 was to unleash the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade on the Ndebele tribes, resulting in the massacre of an estimated 20,000 people. At that time the liberals turned their faces away while muttering hollow platitudes about self-determination and periods of adjustment.

  "<p>As part of UK prime minister David Cameron's cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday, Andrew Mitchell left the Department for International Development (DfID) \u2013 where he had been international development secretary for more than two years \u2013 to become chief whip.</p> <p>The former transport secretary, Justine Greening, will replace him.</p> <p>Mitchell, who held the post in the shadow cabinet prior to his 2010 appointment, said he was sad to be leaving the department, although, according to Guardian colleagues, chief whip is apparently a post he's always wanted.</p> <p>Mitchell has been widely praised for bringing greater transparency to the department's aid spending and upholding the UK government's commitment to keep its 0.7% aid pledge despite the tough economic climate and opposition from within his own party. DfID funding was ringfenced in the last comprehensive spending review.</p> <p>Mitchell has kept the UK's profile high among the donor community, and in June landed a job <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jun/29/andrew-mitchell-busan-aid-panel\" title=\"\">on a panel aimed at creating a new global partnership on development co-operation</a>. Moreover, it was on Mitchell's watch that Cameron was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/may/09/johnson-sirleaf-yudhoyono-cameron-development\" title=\"\">appointed co-chair of a UN high-level panel tasked with devising post-2015 development goals</a>.</p> <p>Cameron praised Mitchell's energy and commitment to the role. \"Andrew has done a superb job as Britain's development secretary,\" he said. \"He has made British development policy transparent, focused and highly effective. His energy and passionate commitment have placed Britain at the forefront of international efforts to improve the lives of millions of the world's poorest people. He has made a real difference.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, Mitchell has not been without his critics. Aid groups were unimpressed that, during his DfID tenure, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jun/16/aid-groups-broken-spending-pledge\" title=\"\">legislation to get the 0.7% pledge enshrined in statute was delayed until 2015</a>, two years later than outlined in the coalition agreement. Mitchell has also been criticised for focusing too strongly on targets and outcomes.</p> <p>On Twitter, reaction to the move has been one of general disappointment.</p> <p>Demented Bonxie tweeted: \"I'm not at all pleased that they've nicked Andrew Mitchell from DfID\", while Nigel Ellway wrote he was a \"damn good #DFID secretary\".</p> <p>Peter Guest was less gushing: \"Andrew Mitchell's gone from #DfID. Despite his habit of telling same story at every event, he was pretty knowledgeable.\"</p> <p>There was also some concern that Greening may choose to reverse the government's 0.7% aid pledge. NGOs will no doubt be stressing the importance of retaining the commitment.</p> <p>One person who clearly won't miss Mitchell, however, is Mehreen, who tweeted: \"Andrew Mitchell's insufferable, shrilly, monotone voice will be put to use as Chief Whip. Lots of cheers from the starving Africans #dfid\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://storify.com/gdndevelopment/reaction-to-cabinet-reshuffle-of-leadership-at-dfi.js\"> <script src=\"https://storify.com/gdndevelopment/reaction-to-cabinet-reshuffle-of-leadership-at-dfi.js\"></script><noscript>[<a href=\"http://storify.com/gdndevelopment/reaction-to-cabinet-reshuffle-of-leadership-at-dfi\" target=\"_blank\">View the story \"Reaction to cabinet reshuffle of leadership at DfID UK - in tweets \" on Storify</a>]</noscript> </figure>",
  "<p>David Cameron was finding, if he did not know already, how hard a cabinet reshuffle can be as he failed to persuade Iain Duncan Smith to leave work and pensions to run the justice department, and he battled for hours, eventually successfully, to prise Lady Warsi from the Conservative chairmanship to a new post in the Foreign Office.</p> <p>Cameron also found himself locked in a more gracious battle with Justine Greening after she was shifted from transport, a post she had held for 10 months. She was asked to take over international development.</p> <p>There were also suggestions that Jeremy Hunt, the surprise new health secretary, had been initially listed for the environment department.</p> <p>At least Ken Clarke, the veteran justice secretary, had the good grace to join the political departure lounge by agreeing to be the minister without portfolio with the right to advise on economics.</p> <p>Overall the reshuffle represents a clear shift if not quite a lurch to the right.</p> <p>The appointment of Chris Grayling, initially slated to take over work and pensions, as the new justice secretary could, alongside Hunt's promotion, turn out to be the most significant announcement of a less than seismic cabinet-level reshuffle. (More wide-scale changes will occur at more junior ministerial levels over the next 24 hours.)</p> <p>Despite his background at Channel 4 and as a former member of the SDP, Grayling knows how to please the party right, and he will take a tougher line on prisons, sentencing and the European convention. Clarke used to say: \"Theresa May locks them up and I let them out.\" That will no longer be quite the set-up.</p> <p>But Grayling, in the two and a half years left to him, will hardly have the money to start a big prison-building programme. He is more likely to take the payment-by-results model he had developed for the work programme at the Department for Work and Pensions and ensure it is used more widely in punishment in the community.</p> <p>He will also be more prepared to stage confrontations with the European court of human rights and the European Union. That will please Tory backbenchers eager to see some edge about national sovereignty.</p> <p>Grayling's departure also ensures that Duncan Smith will see his cherished universal credit model into implementation. But IDS has an iconic status in the Conservative party that will make it more difficult for George Osborne to secure a second round of big welfare cuts planned for next year. Expect to hear of threats of resignation.</p> <p>But the appointment of Hunt is the most outward-facing decision, designed to rebuild the government's credentials on the NHS after the disaster of the health bill. Cameron simply cannot afford to go into the 2015 election with the whole of the NHS opposed to or confused by his reforms. It marks a strong vote of confidence in Hunt, but his dismissal would have reflected on Cameron and his own relations with the Murdoch empire.</p> <p>Cameron will be relieved that Lansley, his former boss at Conservative central office, swallowed his pride to take up the post of leader of the House, a position that does not always signal the end of a political career, as Margaret Beckett found out when she was promoted to foreign secretary.</p> <p>Hunt's departure could also make the government response to the Leveson inquiry's conclusions more even-handed. Leveson's inquiry into media regulation is likely to result in radical proposals that the government will be minded to resist. A response from Hunt, rightly or wrongly, would be seen to be hopelessly tainted.</p> <p>Osborne, who retains his pre-eminent economic status as chancellor, will be pleased to see Owen Paterson as environment secretary, since he is likely to be open to a second round of relaxation of planning laws. Paterson leaves Northern Ireland with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/04/belfast-rioters-police-officers\" title=\"\">riots on the streets</a>. Osborne will be equally pleased to see Greening leave transport after 11 months, since she was likely to resist his support for a third runway at Heathrow, another key plank of his growth agenda.</p> <p>Grant Shapps, the new Conservative co-chairman, leaves the housing brief with plans laid for a big social housing programme, due to be announced this week. He will be a ubiquitous performer on TV, relieving some of the ridiculous load placed on Michael Fallon.</p> <p>For the Liberal Democrats there are no changes at cabinet level, but there are expected to be extensive lower-level changes, with David Laws joining forces with Michael Gove to claim clearer co-ownership of schools and social mobility policy.</p>",
  "<p>The new environment secretary, Owen Paterson, is set to be blooded in his new job by the start of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/badgers\">highly controversial badger cull</a> in England. Animals will be shot within weeks, unless ongoing legal challenges succeed in granting the creatures a stay of execution or the expected protests stall the marksmen. The cull aims to curb the scourge of tuberculosis in cattle and Paterson, when shadow environment secretary, wholeheartedly backed the farmers who support the cull, despite revealing that as a child he had kept an orphaned badger as a pet.</p> <p>That is the most pressing issue in his in-tray, though rising food prices and the alternating <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt?intcmp=239\">threat of floods</a> and droughts require urgent attention too - tricky given the huge budget cut his predecessor accepted for the department. </p> <p>But the most important issue is far broader: the fate of David Cameron's pledge to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\">make his government the \"greenest ever\"</a>. As the economy has tanked, the Tory right has looked to bury that pledge in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/21/environment-budget-2012-osborne-planning\">name of growth at any cost</a>.</p> <p>But environmental campaigners should prepare for deep disappointment: despite <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/newsshow.aspx?id=7&amp;ref=132\">listing \"trees\" as an interest</a>, Paterson is no treehugger. In May, he reportedly told the Cabinet that it should <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/05/unemployment-is-down-exports-are-booming-but-paterson-hague-and-fox-all-urge-chancellor-to-do-more.html\">end all energy subsidies</a>, such as those for wind and solar power, and fast-track shale gas exploitation. He also urged more aviation capacity, which seems far more likely now Justine Greening - implacably opposed to a third runway at Heathrow has been removed. As MP for North Shropshire, Paterson has <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/newsshow.aspx?id=7&amp;ref=132\">spoken against wind farms</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/newsshow.aspx?id=7&amp;ref=280\">new pylons needed to carry their power</a> to the national grid. </p> <p>His appointment marks a sharp lurch away from the green-minded policies which sheltered in the environment department and a significant weakening of the green voice at the Cabinet table. </p> <p>His predecessor, Caroline Spelman, presided over the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/17/forest-sell-off-abandoned-sorry-caroline-spelman\">disastrous attempt to sell-off England's publicly owned forests</a> and woodlands. But she spoke convincingly, if quietly, about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jun/02/uk-green-spaces-value\">value of the nation's natural environment</a> and the false economy of despoiling it in the desperate search for a quick fix to the recession. The responsibility for guarding the nation's natural capital now lies in Paterson's hands. </p> <p>Greens will not see those as safe. Paterson is seen as being on the right of the Conservative party - keen to deregulate and opposed to gay marriage, for example. And if you are tempted by omens, consider this: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Paterson\">Paterson's brother-in-law is apparently arch climate sceptic writer Matt Ridley</a>.</p> <p>Finally, a word on Spelman. Her dismissal to the backbenches is hardly a surprise after a difficult tenure which included the coalition government's first major U-turn - the reversal on the forestry sell-off - and the high profile troubles over the badger cull. Her trouble, in my opinion, began when she offered up a massive budget cut for her department in the comprehensive spending review, the biggest of any big ministry. Worst hit were the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt?intcmp=239\">nation's flood defences, whose funding plunged</a>. That may be a false economy that comes back to bite Paterson if one of the increasing number of floods hits a major city like Leeds or York. </p> <p>But Spelman clearly understood that a failure to tackle climate change and the loss of natural spaces and all the creatures that vanish with them will have a real cost for us all. Perhaps it was her conviction that sustainability is not optional - awkward for George Osborne and his growth-at-any-cost colleagues - that did for her, and not the forestry fuss.</p>",
  "<p>Lady Warsi will go down in history for something truly noteworthy: she was the first Muslim woman in the cabinet, the very highest echelon of the UK government.</p> <p>Warsi's rise \u2013 the daughter of an immigrant Pakistani mill worker in the north of England who became a lawyer, life peer and political trailblazer in Westminster \u2013 will make for a great story. But historians will also be curious about why her star fell so abruptly after two years.</p> <p>After considering an offer from the prime minister overnight, she decided to accept demotion to senior minister of state at the Foreign Office, and a role as minister for faith and communities. She will attend cabinet.</p> <p>Just last week Warsi was honest enough to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9513265/Baroness-Warsi-plea-to-remain-as-Tory-chairman.html#disqus_thread\" title=\"\">admit that she very much wanted to remain in the job</a> of Conservative party chairman. But the dilemma of her role was highlighted by that interview. She argued for her post, saying: \"If you look at the demographics, at where we need to be at the next election, we need more people in the north voting for us, more of what they call here 'blue collar' workers and I call the white working class.</p> <p>\"We need more people from urban areas voting for us, more people who are not white and more women. I play that back and think: 'I'm a woman, I'm not white, I'm from an urban area, I'm from the north, I'm working-class \u2013 I kind of fit the bill. All the groups that we're aiming for are groups that I'm familiar with.\"</p> <p>It was a powerful argument, and one that will have caused a modernising prime minister concern on several fronts \u2013 especially, as Operation Black Vote's director, Simon Woolley pointed out, as much of the pressure for her to be sacked had come from within his own party. \"That sends a worrying message, that frankly the challenges of tackling the baggage towards women and minorities haven't properly been addressed,\" Woolley told BBC News on Tuesday.</p> <p>When she was appointed Warsi also railed against suggestions that her appointment was \"tokenistic\".</p> <p>Her performance since May 2010 must have come under scrutiny as Cameron decided how to reshuffle the pack. Here she has been found wanting for many in the party, not because of her background but because many Tories see the party becoming deeply unpopular with voters and ask what she has done about it.</p> <p>Perhaps the most obvious criticism was that Warsi was not striding through broadcast studios and newspaper editors' offices putting the government's case, especially at tricky times such as the controversy over Jeremy Hunt's handling of the BSkyB bid, the simmering public resentment over health service reforms, and growing pressure over the economic strategy. Instead that job has been more often done by Warsi's deputy, Michael Fallon, and fellow cabinet members such as William Hague, Theresa May, Justine Greening and Michael Gove.</p> <p>Warsi's position was further weakened earlier this year when she was forced to refer herself for investigation after details emerged of her claiming expenses while staying with a supporter in London, and questions were asked about how often she was joined on public trips by her business partner.</p> <p>Warsi herself argues she has been doing a different job: spending two days a week touring constituencies and knocking on doors. It is a tribute to that work, she argues, that the Conservative party, halfway through a parliament, has more councillors than their two main rivals, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, put together.</p> <p>Warsi's obvious powers of persuasion were not enough, however, to save her job. In keeping with a woman who has broken so many barriers in her life, Warsi managed to take control of her own departure, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToryChairman\" title=\"\">announcing on Twitter</a>: \"It's been a privilege and an honour to serve my party as co-chairman, signing off as @ToryChairman, signing on as @sayeedawarsi,\" she tweeted. A Tory chairman tweeting their exit \u2013 that must be another first for the history books.</p>",
  "<p>Mum's funeral takes place at the Millennium Cemetery, a pale brick square that stands cringing in the shadow of the Fun Junction on the edge of town. It looks like a Little Chef. Three council grunts in hi-vis jackets stand smoking in the soft cold rain, nothing to do but watch and wait before they can start lling in some hole. There's a tall, rail-thin man with a face so drooping he could only ever have become an undertaker. And there are great-aunts and neighbours and Office Angels and tight suits and hats and two kinds of faces. The melting ones and the blank ones.</p> <p>There's Dean Hessenthaler, Oscar's dad, huge in his thick, expensive Kray-twin overcoat, meaty face grim as he pretends to look at the flowers piled around us. Christ, he's let himself go.</p> <p>There's the Reverend Luke Newell, the vicar, twisting his hands like a nonce. Looks about my age though he must be older. This must be his biggest gig so far, and he's got the fear bad. Looks like he could piss himself any moment.</p> <p>And there's Oscar, solemn and still, a six-year-old Kennedy in his suit and skinny black tie. He looks cool as, like he's in a band. And every time eyes fall on him they fill with tears. Damp tissues fly to noses. Oscar turns his gaze on someone and they dissolve. The blank faces become melting faces.</p> <p>The only person who seems immune is Dean. When he first sees Oscar he murmurs, 'All right, kiddo.' And when Oscar doesn't say anything back, he just nods like he's got the answer he's expected all along. Oscar doesn't even seem<br>to see him.</p> <p>Red eyes, red noses. Sniffles and murmurs. Even from the journalists, even from the police. Pale faces, black clothes. Red, white and black the colours of this funeral. Swastika colours. Death colours. None of that funeral-as-celebration-of-life bollocks today. No party dresses. No paper hats. No Hawaiian shirts. No football kits or teddy bears. None of the gimmicks you sometimes get at the contemporary burial.</p> <p>Flick through the pages of the trauma porn mags, and you'll soon find a kid being buried in the QPR away kit, or a girl going into the underworld in a tutu. Or an old guy buried with his golf clubs, his car keys, or his Northern soul records: a kind of council estate pharaoh, proving that you can take it with you.</p> <p>Not here.</p> <p>'Come on, Billy, let's do this thing.' Oscar whispers it, but his voice is steady like he's a general leading troops over the top. Or rather, like an actor leading other actors over the top. Like someone whose learned his part. He squares his shoulders, stands up straight. One skinny metre of distilled heroism. He tugs at my hand, urgent and with surprising force for such a stickboy. I follow him and I can feel my own face beginning to melt like I was some stupid Office Angel. Well, fuck that. I'm not having that. I squat down, hold him by his shoulders, look him square in the eye and say,'OK, bud, let's do it. Let's roll.' And I stand up and we're inside.</p> <p>Every day I find stories sadder and more stupid than ours. Like this morning.This morning I read about a toddler from Inverness who died after falling and cutting himself on a vase. Russell Poulter was enjoying himself with his favourite toys when he knocked over the ornament and fell on the shards which slashed his neck. All of this in front of his mother, a nurse, who must have known what was happening to her little boy but couldn't do anything about it. One minute she's washing up, listening to her first born playing, and next she's cradling his head while the life flows out of him. A sadder story than ours. And stupid because what could be more harmless than a vase?</p> <p>Mrs Poulter didn't even like the vase. It was a cheap, gaudy thing, a present from her mother-in-law who was famous for her lack of taste. She'd been meaning to boot sale it.</p> <p>Sad. Stupid.</p> <p>I get all those mags now. <em>Chat</em>, <em>Bella</em>, <em>Best</em>, <em>Take a Break</em>, <em>Love It</em>, <em>Reveal</em>, <em>Pick Me Up</em> \u2013 most of the others. The sort that deal in real-life heartbreak. The sort that shout <em>Life! Death! Prizes!</em> in swirly circus writing underneath the title. The sort that tell me about the Russell Poulters of this world. It's good. It helps. It means that I can tell myself that I'm lucky.</p> <p>I'm lucky because I'm still alive and Oscar is alive, and we have a house and enough money to go to Morrisons once a week and buy Cheerios.</p> <p>Yeah, Oscar. Let's do it. Let's bury our stupid mum, the woman who thought it was worth fighting to the death with some random no one in a council car park.</p> <p>From the outside the chapel looks like a motorway diner, and inside it's pretty much the same. Inside you could be in any modern parish church, any museum, any supermarket, any school, any jail.</p> <p>The service itself is pretty retro. Poetry. Hymns. Psalms. Aunt Toni, Mum's sister, organised it all, and I can't say I'd have done it any differently but it doesn't mean that it's right. 'Cause it's not. It's all so, so wrong. The Reverend <br>Luke talks about Mum's life and puts in all the stuff we \u2013 Toni and me \u2013 told him to put in, but he makes her sound small somehow. Like just another ordinary Office Angel. Someone you'd get in to fix your filing systems and organise the Christmas do. It's all just words. Not even words. Sounds. Noises bubbling away. And he doesn't mention the way she died. That pathetic playground tussle, that stupid push and pull. And I think that's a good call: it's such an embarrassing way to go, why would you talk about that? And Rev Luke doesn't talk about the one person who got us to gather here. He doesn't talk about Aidan Jebb.</p> <p>The one more or less modern touch is a PowerPoint presentation of photos from Mum's life sound-tracked by Vaughan Williams's <em>Lark Ascending</em>. And in every picture Mum faces the camera with a wide-eyed, wide-mouthed, madly optimistic grin. From gurgling baby in 1969, to the glossed exec snapped at the Southwood Enterprise Awards 2009, Mum seems to be shouting 'Yay! ROFL!' Seeing all the photos like that, she looks mad. It makes me wonder if she wasn't sort of retarded in some way.</p> <p>Is the funeral what Mum would have wanted? Probably not. She was an events organiser after all, she would have made it a huge occasion. An event organised by Mum stayed organised. She would have done Event Death. There<br>would have been something spectacular, something to get it talked about, remembered \u2013 I can imagine her going into the chapel to the sound of 'Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! A Man After Midnight'. Or 'Going Underground' even.<br>Something outrageous anyway.</p> <p>And it wouldn't have been here, in this Little Chef chapel. The venue would have been exclusive, thought about. Hard to get to, but worth the effort when you were there. The hippest, happening boneyard. A cemetery with a view.</p> <p>But funerals aren't for the dead. The dead don't give a fuck. No, funerals are totally for the living. And this funeral is a traditional, functional one, meant for those of us who are hoping just to keep functioning in the traditional English way. To keep putting one foot in front of the other until we're through and clear of it all.</p> <p>Not all the living appreciate the effort. My dad's not here (a solitary text: <em>thinkin of U m8</em>. M8? He's not my m8. He's my father. He should remember that. And he should sort out predictive text) but mostly it's a success. And success here is measured by the volume of quiet sobbing in the church, the number of bone-crunching handshakes I get back at Oaks Avenue \u2013 and by the amount of bargain booze we shift at the wake.</p> <p>You don't have to be dead to be a ghost. Look around and you'll see people who are ghosts in their own lives. Maybe most people are. Drifting through the streets and the shops and holidays, sighing and moaning. Or raging at the way they've ended up, wrapped in stuff. In ropes and chains. Jobs and houses. Tax credits. Rent and mortgages and parents' evenings and city breaks.</p> <p>And there's worse things to be than a ghost. You could be a dangerous zombie, trapped in an endless tramp from dealer to police desk to social worker to hostel to street. That's us now. Our country: ghosts and zombies everywhere you look.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/29/not-the-booker-prize-aj-kirby\" title=\"\">After what happened last week</a>, it came as a considerable relief to open up Life! Death! Prizes \u2013 and not just because that meant I was no longer reading Paint This Town Red. Stephen May's second novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781408819135/life-death-prizes\" title=\"\">Life! Death! Prizes!</a>, is well-ordered, tightly written and witty. It's a book you laugh with rather than at. Thank goodness.</p> <p>May's control over his material is demonstrated right from the off with a funeral scene that's effectively bleak, but also contains a few well-aimed stabs of black humour:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Not all the living appreciate the effort. My dad's not here (a solitary text: thinkin of U m8. M8? He's not my m8. He's my father. He should remember that. And he should sort out predictive text.)\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Since we already know that Billy and his younger brother Oscar are at their mum's funeral, this joke also provides a neat way of introducing the book's central theme: the fact that the boys are pretty much on their own. Billy is 19 and Oscar six. Mum died suddenly, fighting off a mugger. Billy's dad doesn't appear much beyond that notable text message. Meanwhile, according to Billy, Oscar's own (different) dad is a violent drunk. Their mother's sister, Aunt Toni, is the only potential steadying adult influence, but her boyfriend Frankie is an \"idiot\" and, besides, Billy decides he can cope alone.</p> <p>Soon Billy and Oscar are watching films like Kung Fu Panda on repeat, surrounded by pizza boxes and spliff-ends, and occasionally failing to get Oscar to school. Billy is falling in love with a girl who already has a boyfriend (who is, tragically, \"handsome, funny, talented\"), and he's starting to obsess about his Mum's killer. He's also having problems with small town life in general: filling time \"staring into space\" in an uninspiring job, and getting into rucks with gangs of feral kids.</p> <p>When May introduces the latter, he's self-aware enough to know he's dealing in Asbo cliche: \"hoods up, caps hammed tight on to their heads, hands thrust deep into pockets, as though auditioning for some generic movie about teen gangs.\" And he's skillful enough to quickly add new twists, with Billy immediately saying these \"would-be bad motherfuckers\" actually remind him of \"the kids on South Park\". Better still, the author has the guts to take a closer look at the flawed humans beneath the hoods. One of them even ends up having a surprisingly good time working with Billy in the local lawnmower museum \u2013 without, thankfully, turning into a saint.</p> <p>The writing is similarly controlled and knowing throughout. The book follows a predictable path; the fact that Billy can't cope as well as he first imagines is hardly surprising. But there's enough charm and dark comedy to make the journey worthwhile. I would have been tempted to describe May as having the potential to be the next Nick Hornby \u2013 if <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=stephen+may+nick+hornby&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a\" title=\"\">a quick google hadn't revealed that plenty of others have already done so</a> before me. He has the same ability to stay just the right side of mawkish and the same endearing humour.</p> <p>But he is not yet quite as proficient. There are a few cracks. In fact, that mercifully efficient, knowing and sardonic prose itself began to cause me problems. Like most books nowadays, the whole thing's written in the present tense. For once, this isn't just because of lazy obedience to current fashion: there are good structural reasons for May's narrator to be speaking now, rather than recalling, and the device adds considerable tension as the book moves towards an uncertain outcome. But the fact that Billy is apparently telling us about the here and now in such measured, relaxed and sharp tones starts to feel wrong, since he also asks us to believe that he is having all kinds of difficulties, is beset by paranoia, is blunt at the edges and is falling apart at the seams. It certainly didn't sound like he was losing his mind.</p> <p>If you'll allow a slight contradiction, there are also a few too many clumsy lines. \"This kind of info doesn't leak, it spurts,\" we are told at one stage. \"Stains everyone.\" Really?! Perhaps I was too prone to see howlers post AJ Kirby - but then, if the innuendo is actually intentional, I have no idea what purpose it serves. Perhaps it's a reflection of Billy's 19-year-old mind? Perhaps you could also say the same about the following joke about a doctor: \"You wouldn't go to her if you wanted a sick note or anything. No wonder she had to get out of Merseyside.\" But again, even this line is intentionally gauche, it seemed to me that that little was gained for the sake of such an awkward moment.</p> <p>While I'm moaning, I should also note that the character of Oscar, the younger brother, didn't quite convince me. He's supposed to be a six-year-old who's wise beyond his years, but even so, he sometimes seemed too precocious. An ironic instance in some dialogue with Billy:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I say, 'Perhaps you ought to take some responsibility for yourself big man.'</p> <p>He fixes me with a stern look. 'Billy I'm six.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That's quite funny - but can you imagine a six-year-old understanding the implications of that statement? Possibly, but it didn't ring true for Oscar. Perhaps if it were a child actor rather than a thinly drawn character on the page, it might work. As it is, I'm not so sure\u2026</p> <p>One thing I can say on that latter subject, however, is that this book has feel-good/feel-bad film written all over it. Probably starring Hugh Grant. I'm sure it would charm huge audiences. On its own, the book is less of a sure-fire winner. But at least no one could regret reading it.</p> <p>Next time: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781908885012/tales-from-the-mall\" title=\"\">Tales From The Mall</a> by Ewan Morrison</p>",

  "<p>What store do you set by anonymous online reviews? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/02/ratings-boost-restaurants?newsfeed=true\">Research from an American university</a> would suggest quite a lot: it recently revealed the terrifying importance customers attach to a restaurant's status on <a href=\"http://www.yelp.co.uk/\">Yelp</a>. A mere half-star difference in ratings resulted in a considerable jump or plummet in business (interesting given the site rounds a 3.74 down to three and a half stars, and awards four stars to a 3.75).</p> <p>All the more incentive, you might say, for restaurateurs to try harder. Except that by their nature, the anonymity of online reviews means these sites are ridden with problems. <a href=\"http://www.london-eating.co.uk/\">London Eating</a> now suffers for its former success. Seen as influential, it's so awash with shills, PRs and those with other vested interests that, apart from its <a href=\"http://www.london-eating.co.uk/new-openings/\">page of new restaurant openings</a>, I stopped using it years ago. <a href=\"http://www.hardens.com/\">Harden's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.zagat.com/\">Zagat</a> are somewhat better: they benefit from editors who scrutinise individual contributors. The <a href=\"http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/\">Good Food Guide</a>, the latest edition of which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/04/cock-hemingford-grey-pub-year\">came out this week</a>, uses professional \u2013 at any rate, paid \u2013 critics and is fairly reliable.<br><br>Little wonder, then, that many restaurants \u2013 such as Hawksmoor \u2013 email customers directly to ask them how their meal went, or that two companies have <a href=\"http://www.electriccork.com/n-e-w-s/2012/08/06/feefo-customer-feedback-trials/\">signed a partnership</a> to help restaurants monitor feedback more closely. The system lets the restaurants know what the customers ate, where they were sitting and who served them \u2013 this is presumably more useful and easier to correct than \"FoieGrasLover452\" having a public tantrum about not being greeted with sufficient deference.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1350025/TripAdvisor-feels-wrath-Dragons-Den-star-Duncan-Bannatyne.html\">Duncan Bannatyne well knows</a>, a single bad review, even unfair, can poison customers' minds against staying in a hotel or visiting a restaurant. For well-established places with huge customer turnover, that might not matter. But for a new B&amp;B or a small independent restaurant, it could be fatal \u2013 especially if the negative review has been maliciously posted by a curtain-twitching rival. (One Midlands IT consultant estimated he lost 80% of his business after he was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15575171\">falsely called a thief and a paedophile</a> in Google's online reviews. The libel remained live for over a year.)</p> <p>TripAdvisor, more popular in this country than Yelp, isn't bad for hotels but is functionally useless for choosing restaurants. It mainly seems to be written by tourists, and new visitors to a city are by definition inexpert local restaurant critics. Its <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurants-g186338-London_England.html\">highest-rated London restaurant</a> is a desperately dreary and tinkly Gordon Ramsay place; the current number four is the stroppy blond's <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d719242-Reviews-Restaurant_Gordon_Ramsay-London_England.html\">Chelsea flagship</a>.</p> <p>These rankings have less to do with the food served in the restaurants than with a) the media ubiquity of the man who doesn't cook in them; and b) the fact that most of TripAdvisor is written by out-of-towners, and the dullest Michelin joints appeal to people who crave fawning, internationalist uniformity from the restaurants they visit. Bafflingly, out of 10,000 London restaurants, an <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2403463-Reviews-De_Palo_s-London_England.html\">obscure pasta joint</a> is currently ranked second best. It isn't. This also demonstrates how staid and self-fulling TripAdvisor's rankings can become. With a new troop of tourists from Kansas City arriving every night and dutifully writing up what a good dinner they had, a restaurant can gain an online importance in wild disproportion to the status it actually deserves.</p> <p>Many of the problems with TripAdvisor and its ilk stem from the tension between the stated aims of these sites and their need to get as many users as possible. The best review site won't necessarily be the one with the most people writing for it. Earlier this year, TripAdvisor started letting people <a href=\"http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/02/03/2012/342643/New-TripAdvisor-rating-system-prompts-concern.htm\">give star ratings to restaurants without even creating a profile</a>. What was to stop restaurant owners from awarding themselves five stars every time they got to a new computer, while trashing their rivals at the same time? If you had to give your full name on TripAdvisor, you might think carefully before, say, <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2196839/Heston-Blumenthal-latest-victim-fake-reviews-Trip-Advisor.html\">accusing Heston Blumenthal of poisoning you</a>.</p> <p>In February this year the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16823012\">Advertising Standards Authority ruled</a> that TripAdvisor could no longer claim its reviews could be \"trusted\". A more rigorous system to check individual reviews would be more expensive for websites like TripAdvisor to administer, but it would far better serve the users of that site, not least when people's livelihoods are at stake.</p>",
  "<p>With the challenges of climate change and food and water security, there's never been a greater need for innovative, sustainable farming in the UK. But the industry is facing a severe shortage of new recruits. With the average age of a farmer at 58, <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/ farmersapprentice/careers/\" title=\"\">the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) report</a> estimates the UK will need 60,000 new entrants over the next decade.</p> <p>One of the biggest obstacles for aspiring farmers is the cost \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/31/07/2012/134214/Farmland-prices-rise-around-the- world.htm\" title=\"\">especially the increasing price of farmland</a> \u2013 and most opportunities arise through succession or inheritance. Startup costs are also high.</p> <p>But there are encouraging signs. Demand for agricultural courses is increasing, reports <a href=\"http://www.harper-adams.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Harper Adams University College</a>, which has experienced an 11% increase over the last five years, while the <a href=\"http://rac.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Agricultural College</a> has seen demand increase by 8% this year. Russell Readman, agriculture course manager at Harper Adams, explains that the industry is in a more buoyant mood; the key driver being the need to increase sustainable food production.</p> <p>Graduates from agricultural courses enjoy exceptionally high employment rates, with Harper Adams in <a href=\"http://www.harper-adams.ac.uk/news/201689/harper- adams-in-top-three-for-graduate-employment\" title=\"\">the top three in the country</a>. Readman attributes this success to the year in industry all students undertake during their course, giving them exposure to the workplace and helping them gain key skills \u2013 both technical and interpersonal. Employer feedback is that these students have a can-do attitude, while \"the applied nature of the courses demonstrates principles in practice\".</p> <p>The diversity of opportunities in farming also contributes to the high employment rates, according to Readman, with the sector offering roles in both food production and ancillary services. It's also a global industry and many students find their transferable skills are useful abroad.</p> <p>So how can the farming sector attract potential recruits?</p> <h2><strong>Improved careers education and awareness</strong><br></h2> <p>Greater understanding of the range of opportunities would help dispel the myths that farming is low-skilled and low-paid. The general feeling is that more could be done in schools to promote farming as an aspirational career choice, and to make better links between subjects such as geography or chemistry and their applications in farming.</p> <h2><strong>Campaigns and initiatives</strong><br></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/communitysupportedagriculture\" title=\"\">Community supported agriculture</a> (CSA) can help encourage more people into farming by offsetting some of the costs. Farmers receive working capital for investment, and receive a higher return for produce. CSA initiatives can include box schemes, farm shops and farmers' markets, as well as many urban food growing projects, city farms and community gardens. In addition, they help to raise the status of farmers, and promote better links and understanding between rural and urban communities.</p> <p>Other campaigns such as the <a href=\"http://www.makinglocalfoodwork.co.uk/index.cfm\" title=\"\">Making Local Food Work</a> campaign which provides support to community food enterprises and organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.plunkett.co.uk/ whatwedo/communityfoodenterprises.cfm\" title=\"\">Plunkett Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sustainweb.org/\" title=\"\">Sustain</a> help to promote sustainable farming, while events such as <a href=\"http:// www.farmsunday.org/ofs12b/home.eb\" title=\"\">Open Farm Sunday</a> can improve understanding of food production, farming and the countryside.</p> <p>The Royal Agricultural College also invests in school and community events, through its Summer Schools and Field to Plate days (helping school students learn about food production, plant science and nutrition).</p> <h2><strong>Improved training and career progression routes</strong><br></h2> <p>Lantra, the Sector Skills Council supporting skills and training for people and businesses in the land-based sector, <a href=\"http://www.lantra.co.uk/Downloads/Research/Skills-assessment/UK- Skills-Assessment-Summary-Report-%282010-11%29.aspx\" title=\"\">reports that more effective strategies</a> for lifelong learning and professional development are necessary.</p> <p>With 94% of businesses employing fewer than 10 people, Lantra aims to increase awareness of training and business development. Improving the links between academic research and businesses can promote the innovation and technological change that farming needs to contribute to sustainability challenges.</p> <p>Apprenticeships are one part of this strategy. The number of these has doubled in the past three years, <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/27/02/2012/131636/VIDEO- Agricultural-apprenticeships.htm\" title=\"\">reports Farmers Weekly</a>, which has also launched its <a href=\"http://www.farmersapprentice.co.uk\" title=\"\">own Farmers Apprentice initiative</a> which aims to encourage young people without a background in farming to become farmers.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://producerexchange.marksandspencer.com/news/ms-launches- farming-future-education-programme\" title=\"\">Farming for the Future</a> initiative, launched by Marks &amp; Spencer includes an education programme and provides training and development through bursaries, graduate placements within M&amp;S, scholarships for sustainable (or innovation) projects and postgraduate programmes.</p> <p>Establishing career progression routes would also make farming a more attractive career, says Will Frazer, from Farmers Weekly. Currently, the system tends to be \"haphazard\", with little recording of training or skills. He suggests that farming should also be challenged on how it recruits, focusing less on investment in machinery and more on top-quality graduates. Talent and skill must be rewarded if the industry is to recruit people with ambition and entrepreneurial spirit, he adds.</p> <h2><strong>Better PR</strong><br></h2> <p>Farming needs to offer more inspiring tales focusing on personality traits such as dedication, problem-solving and desire to be your own boss, as well as the satisfaction and personal rewards that can be gained from working in the sector.</p> <p>Stories that communicate these aspects of farming can also attract those who are tired of corporate values and who have the talent to make a positive social and environmental impact.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Jim Carrey is set to cameo in the forthcoming sequel to the superhero comedy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135252/kick-ass\" title=\"\">Kick-Ass</a>. The film's director, Jeff Wadlow, and the writer of the original comic, Mark Millar, have each dropped heavy hints via Twitter that Carrey will play a new character, Colonel Stars, an ex-thug who sets up the superhero team Justice Forever.</p> <p>\"6 days till we start shooting\u2026 and we officially have our Colonel. Alrighty f'n then,\" <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/#!/JeffWadlow\" title=\"\">tweeted Wadlow</a>, using one of Carrey's catchphrases. <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/#!/mrmarkmillar\" title=\"\">Millar later tweeted</a> that the actor playing Colonel Stars \"lives with 200 raccoons and parrots, owns the mask of Loki and [was] named by Spielberg as a genius\". Those comments reference, respectively, Carrey's roles in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and The Mask, and a spat with Steven Spielberg in 1995 that ended with the director praising the Canadian actor.</p> <p>Deadline previously said that Carrey, who is a big fan of the first film and has appeared in public wearing Kick-Ass's outfit, <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/jim-carrey-courted-for-kick-ass-2/\" title=\"\">might take a small role in the sequel</a>.</p> <p>The first Kick-Ass film was directed by Matthew Vaughn, a Brit who helped fund the film's $28m budget himself to avoid going through the studio system. It was a critical and box-office success, though the character Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), an 11-year-old masked vigilante who uses bad language and kills criminals, upset some conservative commentators. Moretz, now 15, will reprise the role in Kick-Ass 2, alongside fellow returnees Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as villain Red Mist.</p> <p>According to Wadlow, the film is set to begin shooting in four days' time, for cinema release next June. Millar has stated the film is not titled Kick Ass 2: Balls to the Wall, as some rumours had it.</p>",
  "<p>The opening quotes set the tone perfectly: Nietzsche's \"If there were gods, how could I bear not to be a god?\" and Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\". What follows is a novel that treads a sometimes precarious line between scenes of gruesome horror and deft comic touches. The horror is a disturbing vision of the abuses humans&#xa0;can and do inflict upon each other, as might be expected from an author with a long record of human rights activism. Kaveney's background as critic, poet, literary commentator and editor are also evident in this, her first novel, which turns out to be a fast-paced and well-informed romp through settings including Sicily, London, Tenochtitlan and Atlantis, with an eclectic cast. At times the story struggles under this burden until we learn what's actually at stake, but as in any decent epic fantasy novel all the strands come together neatly and everything turns out to be at risk as two women, one young and one ancient, do battle against those willing to commit atrocity in order to become gods.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"http://www.plusonepress.com/0984436278__Rituals.htm\" title=\"\">www.plusonepress.com</a></p>",

Cream teas for the tired walker await in the Bankes Arms Hotel (<a href=\"http://www.corfecastlehotel.co.uk/\" title=\"\">dorset-hotel.co.uk</a>) or, for something stronger, the beer garden overlooking the castle at the Greyhound Inn (<a href=\"http://www.greyhoundcorfe.co.uk/\" title=\"\">greyhoundcorfe.co.uk</a>) is the perfect place to relax with a pint.</p> <h2>Melbury Downs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-416664332\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345205975828/Melbury-Downs-Dorset-008.jpg\" alt=\"Melbury Downs, Dorset\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melbury Downs, Dorset Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Distance</strong> 3\u2153 miles <br><strong>Start</strong> Spread Eagle Hill car park, grid ref: ST886187 <br><a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/fontmell-and-melbury-downs/things-to-see-and-do/view-page/item455753/\" title=\"\"><strong>National Trust downloadable route and map</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>Inland Dorset is Thomas Hardy country, with landscapes right out of his novels.

The area is an evocative one \u2013 a nearby sycamore tree was thought to have been once used as a hangman's tree and the coast nearby was smugglers' territory.

The birthplace of the Scouting movement, it has plenty to divert families, with the Baden-Powell Outdoor Centre providing excursions and activities. The real star, however, is the wildlife, with red squirrels, deer, lizards, insects and birdlife all in residence. This short walk takes you through some of the best spots, but further wandering may result in its own wildlife-spotting rewards.</p> <h2>Burton Bradstock</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-416664339\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345206716874/Burton-Bradstock-Dorset-003.jpg\" alt=\"Burton Bradstock, Dorset\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burton Bradstock, Dorset Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Distance</strong> 1 mile <br><strong>Start</strong> Burton Bradstock car park, grid ref: SY491888 <br><a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wra-1356296585308/article-1356403774855/\" title=\"\"><strong>National Trust downloadable route and map </strong></a><br>This short circular walk along golden Burton Cliff takes in some spectacular clifftop views of the Jurassic coast.

The rooms and suites are pretty cool too (white walls, wrought iron beds, rain showers, Georgian fireplaces, retro furniture). You get breakfast in bed delivered to the door in hampers \u2013 a morning picnic of warm savoury flans, Dorset cereals and toasted Townmill breads (if you don't fancy it, you get \u00a310 knocked off the room rate).

When I contacted the UK distributor in June, it acknowledged the negative effect Power Balance had had on its market, but assured me the its products were different. Shuzi even went so far as to invite me to test its bracelets in order to clear up any scepticism I still had. This seemed an excellent idea, and although subsequent efforts to contact Shuzi met with silence, Merseyside Skeptics went ahead and <a href=\"http://www.merseysideskeptics.org.uk/testing-shuzi/the-protocol/\">devised a double-blind test</a> of the bracelets' ability to enhance sporting performance.</p> <p>The idea was simple: if Shuzi's claims were true, a rugby player wearing one ought to benefit from increased concentration and balance \u2013 essential attributes when taking a penalty kick. Over a large number of kicks, it should be easy to tell those taken wearing the performance-enhancing Shuzi band from those with a control bracelet. </p> <p>To make things fair, we bought two Shuzi bands and removed the active chip from one, rendering it an inert control. Using tape to anonymise the two bracelets, we were ready to take our test to a local rugby club to see how its star kicker fared.</p> <p>The results, it's fair to say, were unsurprising. After two hours and 100 kicks, we found no statistically significant difference between the real and control bands. </p> <p>Under double-blind test conditions, Shuzi's product failed to have any statistically significant effect on our rugby player's performance. </p> <p>If Shuzi would still like to prove its bracelets really do work, the Merseyside Skeptics Society will be happy to help arrange another robust test. I for one would welcome proof that the Shuzi bracelets are anything other than another expensive, ineffective sports fad.</p> <p><em>Michael Marshall is vice president of the Merseyside Skeptics Society</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi Abhay, could you tell us a little bit about you and your work around digital and social media?</strong></p> <p>I am a digital engagement specialist. Basically, I help people and organisations create the appropriate voice and context for using social media to run campaigns, identify collaborators, find new audiences and create new forms of interaction via arts projects. I have worked on a handful of ACE funded commissions, with Channel 4 and British Council Arts.</p> <p><strong>How effective are arts and culture organisations at using social media to communicate with audiences?</strong></p> <p>From a theatre performance to an exhibition, arts and culture organisations are brilliant at telling stories, and some are using social platforms to do it, and to great effect. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's <a href=\"http://metmuseum.org/connections/\" title=\"\">Connections project</a> is a fascinating example of taking standard audience engagement \u2013 in this case people being able to see the artworks and artefacts in the museum \u2013 and enhancing that level of communication by making it social and interactive online.</p> <p><strong>What could organisations be doing better?</strong></p> <p>One of the common drawbacks with an organisation's social media use is that the definition of the audience is often limited to the same old demographics, in the sense that a theatre will often only reach out to audiences interested in theatre.</p> <p>On top of that, social engagement is limited to consuming information (you click a link on Twitter or watch a video on YouTube) \u2013 the fundamental problem is that engagement ceases when the action stops. The onus of continuing engagement lies with the organisation to keep that conversation going, but it can often be a very expensive and resource heavy approach. Just think how many of your followers you'd need to follow up on each time they clicked on one of your listings.</p> <p>What we need to do is create the context for audiences to examine their relationship with the message or product by participating in a truly collaborative and improvised activity. <a href=\"http://www.exquisiteforest.com/\" title=\"\">The Exquisite Forest</a> is a fantastic example of this because regardless of technical or aesthetic ability, everyone can take part and shape the direction of this project without fear of judgement.</p> <p>But it's important to remember that the answer doesn't always have to be new technology. Just think about internet memes \u2013 using minimal resources you can broadcast to the whole world, across various backgrounds and ages. Memes show that genuine engagement isn't about technology but about the ability to deconstruct ideas and make them more inclusive.</p> <p><strong>Does social media offer arts organisations more than just a communications tool \u2013 how else can social media be used to their advantage?</strong></p> <p>A lot of arts organisations use social media to communicate \u2013 you deliver a message (marketing, sales, listings, articles), it gets shared and you maybe interact with those who answer. What a lot of arts professionals don't realise is that social media can be used for a lot more \u2013 it's also a really valuable problem solving resource, and the next big step for organisations is using social media to co-create. For a fundamentally creative industry, that's quite profound.</p> <p>Most culture professionals are accustomed to bringing new systems and processes in outside sectors, experts and so on. Social media gives them unprecedented access to a community of experts who they can actively engage with to co-create new ideas and find solutions to genuine problems. With a constant squeeze on the sector, social media can also be used to share resources \u2013 that includes knowledge, skills and even physical assets.</p> <p><strong>What are the inherent problems for arts organisations around social media?</strong></p> <p>Most of the problems are to do with the negative perceptions of social media, which are often based on stories in mainstream media that highlight spectacular failures online.</p> <p>Some might be reluctant to engage with social media and social platforms because they're considered to be conducive to dumbing down content, and this often creates tensions between senior management and employees working to implement new digital ideas and projects.</p> <p>At an individual level, it's about a fear of being inundated by information, the loss of control over one's privacy and the blurring of boundaries between a person's professional and personal lives, all of which may have negative outcomes.</p> <p><strong>You'll be delivering </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/events\" title=\"\"><strong>two digital seminars in October</strong></a><strong> for members of the Culture Professionals Network \u2013 can you tell us a bit more about what those two seminars are about?</strong></p> <p>The seminars are based on my experiences of problem solving and developing digital strategies for arts practitioners and organisations over the past eight years. Most workshops on digital engagement broadly fall into two categories: those that excite people about the possibilities of going online and those that instruct people on how to carry out basic operational tasks. So while you might know how to get things done, you don't necessarily know what to do.</p> <p>There's nothing more stressful than trying to communicate your ideas, thoughts and what you want to do \u2013 without context \u2013 into a box on the screen with a mere 140 characters at your disposal.</p> <p>The October seminars take a more pragmatic approach to digital engagement. The starting point for these sessions isn't technology but ideas. And we'll take a reflective approach to learn how to share and talk about ideas online with the intention of getting things done by involving others. The seminars aren't about telling people how to do their jobs online, it's about helping them bridge the divide between the physical and digital, on their own terms.</p> <p><strong>What practical skills can arts professionals expect to learn from these?</strong></p> <p>The focus of the seminars is on creating a sustainable online presence and digital engagement strategy. The sessions will help arts practitioners define a unique voice, context and identity that they can apply to create a profile on any social media website that suits their individual and organisational needs.</p> <p>Very often arts professionals have to manage more than one project at a time. So the seminars will introduce strategies to create multiple digital identities. They will also introduce essential skills such as curating and moderating digital content while running a campaign.</p> <p>Participants will also be able to start conversations with others online and in the process learn how to build communities and get access to the right people. And finally, we'll also look at a range of free websites and tools that can be used to implement, manage and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns online.</p> <p><strong>Your seminars promote the idea of a 'Working Socially' \u2013 what do you mean by that and how does it translate to an arts organisation or museum?</strong></p> <p>Working Socially is about creating a reflective approach to using social media to focus on all three strands of engagement I mentioned \u2013 sharing, listening and co-creation. For arts organisations and museums this means no longer looking at social media as a marketing tool. It's about creating a culture that encourages all practitioners to create a digital identity not only to share knowledge but communicate their passion, commitment and enthusiasm for the arts. Through this they can developed a shared responsibility to create sustainable, relevant and meaningful engagement.</p> <p><em>Find out more about the digital seminars Abhay is facilitating for the Guardian Culture Professionals Network </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/events\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>As you may have seen yesterday, the newspaper's G2 section featured an excellent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/series/autumn-arts-preview-2012\">autumn arts preview</a>, featuring the best books, films and dance events to look forward to in the coming months. All the major forms of entertainment and artistic media were included... with one reasonably minor exception. Games. </p> <p>So, on the off-chance there are people out there more likely to be looking forward to Assassin's Creed III than Der Ring des Nibelungen at the Royal Opera house, here are the big titles of this autumn's release schedule.</p> <p>We'll be doing an indie and smartphone round-up at some point too, but that takes longer because those crazy kids don't believe in release schedules. For now, though, get your Amazon wish lists ready, here are the mainstream treats of the autumn.<br></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.borderlands2.com/\">Borderlands 2</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>The maniacal 'looter shooter' returns with a new bunch of mercenaries raiding the planet Pandora for all its treasures while an evil corporation seeks to clear our all the undesirables. That's you by the way. Beautiful cell-shaded visuals mix with anarchic humour and a huge range of weapons to produce entertainingly eccentric carnage. Yes. Yes please. <em>21 September</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.codemasters.com/uk/f12012/\">F1 2012</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>Codemasters has reinvented the concept of the motorsports simulation with its enthusiastic, knowledgeable and exciting F1 titles and this year's instalment should continue the good work. Along with all the cars, drivers and circuits from the 2012 season, F1 2012 boasts a Young Driver Test which teaches newcomers the basics of F1 driving. Luckily, I don't think there's a theory test. <em>21 September</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.jp.playstation.com/scej/title/tokyojungle/\">Tokyo Jungle</a> (PS3 \u2013 digital only)</strong></h2> <p>Created by Sony's Japan studio with indie developer Crispy's this is easily the weirdest game on the list \u2013 and hopefully that won't put you off. Set in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo the game gets you to choose an animal from a large selection (including dogs, kangaroos, birds and big cats) and then simply survive on the mean streets, finding food, battling other critters and looking for mates. It's an astonishing mix of genuinely grim sci-fi adventure and cutesy pet sim. <em>26 September</em> </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.ea.com/fifa-soccer-13\">Fifa 13</a> (3DS, PC, PS3, Vita, Wii, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>The behemoth of the sports sim calendar returns with some major mechanical tweaks including improved close-control and greater physicality. If you're connected to the web, it will also pull in real-world footie news and use it to colour your virtual experience. And of course, all the players, major teams and key world leagues are in place. <em>28 September</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.residentevil.com/6/\">Resident Evil 6</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>Survival horror returns in this 'something for everyone' adventure, which provides three separate stories based around a worldwide zombie virus outbreak. Favourite characters such as Leon Kennedy and Chris Redfield return, all of them showcasing different playstyles from Resi history. Could be an all-encompassing return to form, or a big pile of zombie droppings. We'll play it anyway. <em>2 October</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.waroftherosesthegame.com/\">War of the Roses</a> (PC)</strong></h2> <p>A cult hit at several gaming events over the summer, War of the Roses is a squad-based medieval combat sim, in which players join either the House of York or their Lancastrian rivals and indulge in tactical melee combat. The visuals are astonishing and while the multiplayer is clearly going to be bloody awesome, the single-player campaign promises depth and variety too. <em>2 October</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.dishonored.com/\">Dishonored</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>We called this dark steampunk adventure a game-of-the-year contender when we previewed it last month, and we're sticking with that. Created by some of the key people behind Deus Ex and Half-Life, it's an open-world adventure in which a betrayed assassin seeks revenge in a sprawling quasi-Victorian city. And you can posses rats. <em>12 October</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.xcom.com/enemyunknown/entry\">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>Back in the early nineties, the XCOM turn-based strategy games gave players the chance to command a secret government agency against alien attacks. Now Firaxis, the developer behind the famed Civilization series, has re-invented this tense and engaging experience for the modern era. It looks and plays beautifully, and will see off plenty of those long sodden November evenings. <em>12 October</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://lionhead.com/fable-the-journey/\">Fable: The Journey</a> (Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>Peter Molyneux has now left Lionhead, but his final project at the studio was this much-debated Kinect-only fantasy road movie. Lead character Gabriel must travel across the dangerous land of Albion to rediscover his lost tribe and save a fair maiden. Along the way, he gets to look after his horse, using motion controls to ride and interact with it. Sort of a pet sim RPG then. What could possibly go wrong? <em>12 October</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.skylanders.com/giants\">Skylanders Giants</a> (3DS, PS3, Wii, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>Last year, Activision scored a massive hit with its ingenious Skylanders game, which combined collectible toy figures with an approachable family RPG. This time, they're adding a new bunch of \u2013 yes \u2013 giant figures, as well as a larger world and other extras. If you're the parent of a Skylanders fan, you're already being nagged about this. <em>19 October</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://forzamotorsport.net/en-gb/FH/Default.aspx\">Forza Horizon</a> (Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>A fresh take on the leading Xbox driving game series, swapping circuit-based thrills for a more rangey, open structure. The action takes place in and around a fictitious racing event in Colorado, where AI drivers can be challenged to competitions on the spot. To underline the festival feel, the soundtrack has been curated by Rob da Bank, so expect plenty of dubstep with your exotic vehicles. <em>26 October</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://thelordoftherings.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx\">Lego Lord of the Rings</a> (3DS, DS, PC, PS3, Vita, Wii, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>Yep, another action adventure in the seemingly endless Lego series, but this one has a slightly darker feel and it cleverly uses dialogue from the movies to bring some authenticity to the setpiece-hopping narrative. We played it at E3 and enjoyed the ensemble feel with Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli and Boromir all taking part on screen. <em>26 October</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.medalofhonor.com/en_GB\">Medal of Honor: Warfighter</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>This hyper-earnest military shooter has angered some by seeking to portray real-life combat zones and a range of authentic spec ops units. However, developer Danger Close is <em>obsessed</em> with respecting the lives and roles of the combatants it depicts and we're hoping that the game's apparent attempts to show the cost of warfare on the families of the soldiers is revealing and not mawkish. Expect top-end visuals and multiplayer, too. <em>26 October</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/ac3/en-gb/index.aspx\">Assassin's Creed III</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>The time-spanning assassination adventure returns, this time bringing its blend of acrobatics and swordplay to the American revolution. The new lead character, Connor, is half British, half Native American, which puts him in an interesting position when the fight to control the continent begins. Expect lavish set-piece battles, beautiful visuals and some interesting multiplayer options. <em>31 October</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.needforspeed.com/most-wanted\">Need For Speed: Most Wanted</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>In 2010, Guildford-based developer Criterion revolutionalised the Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit series, adding gorgeous visuals, a sexy handling engine and the brilliant Autolog system, which let friends leave highscores for each other within the game world. Most Wanted is updating all the social elements, as well as providing a huge open city to explore and race in. And the multiplayer challenges are enormous fun. <em>2 November</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://halo.xbox.com/halo4/en-US/\">Halo 4</a> (Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>Bungie has gone and now Halo development duties are with Microsoft's own 343 Industries studio \u2013 so can the spirit of Master Chief survive? The jury is out at the moment, but with an epic story featuring the long dormant Forerunners, and an interesting multiplayer structure that ties the action closely to the campaign missions, this is an interesting attempt to kickstart a whole new Halo trilogy. <em>6 November</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://papermario.nintendo.com/\">Paper Mario: Sticker Star</a> (3DS)</strong></h2> <p>Nintendo's cutesy handicraft role-playing series returns, this time in semi-glorious 3D, and with a fresh new gameplay element that challenges you to peel off and collect colourful stickers from the typically adorable environments. The 3DS needs some true must-have titles this Christmas and surely little Paper Mario can be posted in that pigeon hole. <em>11 November</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.callofduty.com/blackops2\">Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>Okay, okay, so this series has some serious detractors \u2013 and Treyarch's decision to set a Black Ops sequel in a near-future America under attack from its own drone army, has been questioned. But, hey, there do seem to be some genuine attempts to update the multi-million dollar recipe with some strategic gameplay and refreshed multiplayer. And might this be the last major Call of Duty title for this console generation? <em>13 November</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://hitman.com/\">Hitman: Absolution</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>Square Enix may have shot itself right in the foot with that <a href=\"http://youtu.be/QQ_jhw5TuxA\">controversial 'sexy nun' trailer</a>, but a new instalment in the Hitman series of stealthy assassinate-'em-ups will always pique the interest of fans who remember the glory days of Agent 47. Can the bald killer overcome sexism to reinstate his murderous gaming regime? Don't bet against him. <em>20 November</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://disney.go.com/mickey/disney-epic-mickey-2.html\">Disney Epic Mickey 2</a>: The Power of Two (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>While the first title had some interesting ideas, melding a platforming adventure with painting elements and Disney history, it was let down by a roving camera and some repetition. This time, developer Junction Point says it has fixed the broken stuff and added a co-op element that sees Mickey teaming up with his predecessor Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. One for the family to snuggle around this winter. <em>23 November</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://far-cry.ubi.com/fc-portal/en-gb/home/index.aspx\">Far Cry 3</a> (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>On the face of it, this looks like yet another shooter sequel with a superhuman lead character and dozens of faceless, vaguely ethnic enemies. But Ubisoft Montreal is promising that its island-based adventure, mixing open-world exploration with bizarre characters and a strange colonial story, is something much more offbeat and interesting. Heart of Darkness: the video game? <em>30 November</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.littlekingsstory.com/\">New Little King's Story</a> (Vita)</strong></h2> <p>Released on the Wii in 2009, the original Little King's Story was a glorious combination of real-time strategy, RPG and life sim, with players controlling a new monarch in a rich fantasy kingdom. Its enduring cult success has led to the promising Vita remake, featuring a more naturalistic art style and a refreshed story. <em>TBA November</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.footballmanager.com/\">Football Manager 2013</a> (PC/Mac)</strong></h2> <p>You know what to expect, of course. A huge database of players and teams as well as an intricate simulation of the manager's life, from training and tactics to coping with player meltdowns and media scandals. Expect the core engine and visuals to be overhauled at the very least, but I predict some more dramatic additions this time round. <em>TBA November</em></p>",
  "<p>The Greek far-right party Golden Dawn has been flirting with an \"outlaw\" rhetoric lately. Appealing to a disgruntled electorate, its MPs constantly try to point out that the Golden Dawn is unlike any other political party in Greece. They are right in this respect. In fact, they are not a party at all: they are acting like a gang of criminal thugs, and it should not be beyond the pale to declare their organisation as such.</p> <p>\"We feel disgusted in the parliament,\" said their leader, Nikos Mihaloliakos, <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xt2ehk_y-yyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyy_news\" title=\"\">in a speech to his followers</a> on 25 August. \"If they want us to, we can abandon it at any given moment and take to the streets. There, they shall see what the Golden Dawn is really about, they will see what battle means, they will see what struggle means, they will see what bayonets sharpened every night mean\". Holding torches, they shouted \"blood, honour, Golden Dawn\" \u2013 a direct translation from the German \"Blut und Ehre\", the motto once carried by the Nazi SA. \"It's you who are our Storm Detachments (Sturmabteilung). Let them come after you!\" he continued, in his usual Nazi-inspired terms. Singing their official hymn \"Raise the flags high\" \u2013 again, a direct translation of the Nazi stormtroopers hymn \"Die fachne hoch\" \u2013 young men and women call for open, violent conflict both with the state and with any opponents on the ground.</p> <p>An organisation with explicit ties to neo-nazism, advocating violence and attacking immigrants and anti-racist marches in the street: does this sound like a legitimate democratic party?</p> <p>It's not unusual for far-right parties to use populist rhetoric to persuade their followers, and for very specific reasons: despite their claims to abhor the parliamentary system, they seem comfortable enough taking advantage of the privileges Greek MPs enjoy, including immunity from prosecution. Several Golden Dawn MPs are awaiting trial for crimes, ranging from armed robbery to severe bodily harm. The now infamous Golden Dawn MP and spokesman Illias Kasidiaris is wanted not just for attacking two leftwing MPs on live television \u2013 images of which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/jun/07/greek-golden-dawn-mp-hits-opponent-tv-video\" title=\"\">were seen around the world</a> \u2013 but <a href=\"http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/204887/ekteneis-oi-anafores-sta-xena-mme-gia-tin-epithesi-kasidiari-tis-hrusis-augis/\" title=\"\">also</a> for <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_10/06/2012_446252\" title=\"\">accessory to robbery, bodily harm and illegal gun possession</a>. His trial for the later offences was to take place on 3 September, but he used his parliamentary privilege to have it postponed.</p> <p>Kasidiaris is by no means an isolated case of thuggery. Only a few hours before the <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4Dcgi/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite6_1_21/06/2012_448355\" title=\"\">severe beating of four Egyptian fishermen</a> in Crete's Perama, Ioannis Lagos, another Golden Dawn MP, proclaimed \"Egyptian fishermen will be held accountable by the Golden Dawn, and by the Greek people for their activity\" in a speech he gave there. Inciting racial violence would be, of course, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/11/thefarright.greece\" title=\"\">illegal in Greece</a>, but he wasn't prosecuted. A few days ago, inside the parliament this time, Golden Dawn MP Dimitris Koukoutsis allegedly <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_29/08/2012_458853\" title=\"\">violently attacked</a> two leftwing MPs and the president of the Pakistani community in Greece, Javet Aslam. The case is still open.</p> <p>The Golden Dawn makes a mockery of the Greek history it claims to venerate. It does this by disrespecting every democratic principle we Greeks, as a nation, should be proud to uphold. But its MPs never go so far as to quit their parliament seats. Mihaloliakos and his followers seem to be quite comfortable in taking advantage of the exposure their party is currently enjoying, as well as the extra funding for their well-oiled PR machine. They thrive inside the very system they claim to despise.</p> <p>By swearing on using violence against anyone they deem unworthy, the Golden Dawn is not unlike a criminal syndicate. It should no longer be treated as a legitimate political party. Even if it means they are temporarily shot up to \"hero\" status, they have to be banned from the political process. The fact that it was provided with this platform was wrong in the first place. Now we must have the courage to ban it from parliament. Allowing messages of hate to be broadcast day and night while we look from afar, heads nodding as our society implodes, is inexcusable. We simply can't allow immigrants to be <a href=\"http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2012/08/13/racist-attacks-increase-iraqi-stabbed-to-death-in-athens/\" title=\"\">brutally beaten and stabbed</a> in our streets every day.</p> <p>Mihaloliakos says he feels disgusted and uncomfortable being inside the Greek parliament. Well Mr Mihaloliakos, the feeling is mutual.</p>",
  "<p>Here's what I love most about John Adams: the gilded celebration of sheer, unadulterated major-key glamour at the end of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuyXEJAG-3g\">On The Dominant Divide</a>, the finale of his Grand Pianola Music. Scored for two pianos, vocalists and ensemble, the piece was composed in 1982, a time when the idea of writing tonal music \u2013 let alone the spangly, hummable tune of On the Dominant Divide \u2013 was, according to many central European and academic diktats, beyond the stylistic and even political pale. </p> <p>As Adams himself remembers, \"the audience response [at the premiere] included a substantial and (to me) shocking number of 'boos'. True, it was a very shaky performance, and the piece came at the end of a long concert of new works principally by serialist composers from the Columbia-Princeton school. In the context of this otherwise rather sober repertoire, Grand Pianola Music must doubtless have seemed like a smirking truant with a dirty face, in need of a severe spanking.\"</p> <p>The three movements of Grand Pianola Music are a brilliant <em>ne plus ultra</em> of one side of Adams's creativity. The piece came to him as a flash of inspiration in a dream \"in which, while driving down Interstate Route 5, I was approached from behind by two long, gleaming, black stretch limousines. As the vehicles drew up beside me they transformed into the world's longest Steinway pianos \u2026 20-, maybe even 30-feet long. Screaming down the highway at 90mph, they gave off volleys of B flat and E flat major arpeggios.\" The effect in the piece he wrote after he woke up is a sort of pile-up between Steve Reich, Rachmaninov, Liszt, Liberace \u2013 and the rest of music history. </p> <p>But let's rewind a bit. Adams was never a composer to play by the rules his predecessors had mapped out for him \u2013 even if those rules were all about opening up musical freedoms. Born in 1947, Adams is half a generation younger than the progenitors of minimalism \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnQdP03iYIo\">Steve Reich</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CViBJCos42M\">La Monte Young</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ZPWiUXYPg\">Philip Glass</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7R6iEQUeMA\">Terry Riley</a>. He was also growing up when those twin antipodes of American music, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7O0VXzbV2Y\">John Cage</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwbPwq3-PAs\">Elliott Carter</a>, were in the full flowering of their creativity. As he studied at Harvard and worked as an orchestral clarinettist on the east coast, he was able to absorb influences from a huge variety of sources.</p> <p>Adams's breakthrough as a composer came when he moved to the west coast \u2013 his home ever since. And the piece that crystallised his creative world was his string septet <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8VwjfCGAqE\">Shaker Loops</a>. Here's what Adams (incidentally, one of today's most virtuosically literate composers: check out his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hallelujah-Junction-Composing-American-Life/dp/0571231152/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346654813&amp;sr=8-1\">collected writings, Hallelujah Junction</a>) says about this piece, written in 1978: \"Rather than set up small engines of motivic materials and let them run free in a kind of random play of counterpoint, I used the fabric of continually repeating cells to forge large architectonic shapes, creating a web of activity that, even within the course of a single movement, was more detailed, more varied, and knew both light and dark, serenity and turbulence.\" </p> <p>You could paraphrase: it's minimalism, but not as you know it. Attracted to the surfaces of the minimalism, but frustrated by its lack of harmonic interest and large-scale momentum, Adams's solution in Shaker Loops was at once more radical and more conservative. Radical, because he was prepared to fuse the purity of minimalist processes with a richer range of references, and conservative because he wanted to find a way to restore old ideas of harmonic ebb and flow to this new style, to create his \"large architectonic shapes\". But just as with Grand Pianola Music, it's the sound and shimmer of Shaker Loops that will make you fall for this music (or at least, it is why I fell for it!) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8VwjfCGAqE\">Have a listen here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395624186\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/arts/2012/2/23/1330021314801/Death-of-Klinghoffer-ENO--007.jpg\" alt=\"Death of Klinghoffer, ENO 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">English National Opera and Metropolitan Opera's production of Adams's Death of Klinghoffer at the London Coliseum in 2012.

There's his first opera,<a href=\"http://youtu.be/DXXmjR0aCug?t=4m30s\"> Nixon in China</a> (which the composer conducts at the Proms on Wednesday with the BBC Symphony Orchestra), which dares to put recent events on the opera stage \u2013 dares, and wins, thanks to the poetry of Alice Goodman's libretto and the irresistible imagination of Adams's music. The score for Nixon is by turns souped-up tonal surrealism (listen to the opening to see what I mean) and a delicate, reflective meditation (in the final act especially). </p> <p>Adams also wrote the huge three-movement orchestral piece <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFj9NSh6x90\">Harmonielehre</a> that recast the expressive power of late romanticism (it virtually quotes Mahler's 10th Symphony in its slow movement) in the garb of a post-minimalist workout. Again, those labels are far less helpful than simply hearing the music: try the unstoppable energy of the start of Harmonielehre, or the first 20 minutes or so of Nixon, one of the most compelling openings to any opera, ever.</p> <p>Adams's music of the later 90s and the noughties has brought another two full-scale operas, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jw33u9qAsE\">The Death of Klinghoffer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fJRoKlCroU\">Doctor Atomic</a>, both on contemporary themes (the murder of Leon Klinghoffer on board the Achille Lauro in 1985, and the birth of the atomic bomb), and he hasn't shirked from big statements on everything from religion to pop culture to natural disasters in his other theatre and vocal works, some of them in collaboration with Peter Sellars.</p> <p>But something else has happened in Adams's recent music. He has continued to develop his palette of references and harmonic richness, even encompassing the European modernism that he seemed at first to resist. There's an ongoing dialogue with Schoenberg (the title of Harmonielehre pays tribute to one of the Austrian composer's masterly didactic tomes) in music such as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV99L4m8uWs\">Chamber Symphony</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxNVzV39Bc\">Violin Concerto</a>; on the other hand, there are obvious and affectionate reworkings of pop tunes and musicals in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f09UYdA-N8\">I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky</a>, and there's a welter of historical and contemporary reference in his recent orchestral piece, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-pp6WD89JU\">City Noir</a>. </p> <p>I'm still undecided over whether this side of Adams's music packs the same punch as his earlier work. It's not because his more recent work is less ambitious \u2013 in a way, it's more far-reaching in its subject matter and what it's trying to do musically, but the risks are greater, too. To my ears, the saturation of the Chamber Symphony or a piece such as his orchestral Guide to Strange Places does not pay off, because there's both too much detail in the chromatic density of some of the harmony and not enough real complexity, and because Adams has a way of subsuming the diversity of his musical sources beneath the sheen and dazzle of his own language, so that everything sounds weirdly homogeneous. But if I'm struggling a bit with his recent work \u2013 and I found Doctor Atomic similarly disappointing compared with Klinghoffer or Nixon \u2013 there are many that would disagree. But what is beyond doubt is that Adams is one of those contemporary voices we all need to hear and keep hearing.</p> <h2>Five key links</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DXXmjR0aCug?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DXXmjR0aCug\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXXmjR0aCug\">Nixon in China</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8VwjfCGAqE\"><br>Shaker Loops</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym9Q5vV44Hw\">Grand Pianola Music</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUiv0jJl9zU\">Harmonielehre</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx1ktwTcPz0\">Violin Concerto</a></p>",
  "<p>My father Dick Percival, who has died aged 93, worked for the same small firm for 50 years. Always a man with a quick temper, he left his first two jobs after \"words with the foreman\", before settling with J Williams Sheet Metal in Pickford Street, Birmingham, first as a sheet-metal worker, later becoming works manager.</p> <p>The older of two brothers, he was born in Birmingham and educated at Stratford Road council school in Sparkbrook. Although he was third in his class he had to leave school at the age of 14 as his family could not afford to buy the books he needed to continue his education. However, a favourite and oft-repeated childhood treat was a one-penny ride on the tram to the Lickey Hills.</p> <p>At the outbreak of the second world war, being in a reserved occupation with J Williams, he was repeatedly denied the chance to join up and was once threatened with prison if he did not return to work. Eventually, the authorities relented and he joined the Royal Berkshire Regiment in February 1943. In total he served for four years and three months, half of this time in Burma, where he saw continuous action between October 1944 and August 1945.</p> <p>He had many narrow escapes, the closest when colleagues either side of him were shot dead by snipers while his platoon were clearing a village. Some time later, the soldier bearing the 2-inch mortar died and he was given this responsibility, being moved from bren gun duties, which he had shared with his best friend Lieutenant Corporal Hickey. Very soon afterwards Hickey and many others were killed. Twice Dick's platoon were cut off and surrounded. On both occasions the Gurkhas fought their way through to relieve them, a debt he never forgot.</p> <p>He was demobbed in 1947 and soon afterwards met his wife-to-be, Jos\u00e9, in Llandudno, north Wales. They married in 1949 and settled in Small Heath, Birmingham, for 15 happy years before starting a family and moving to Worcestershire in 1964. There, Dick's village team, Alvechurch FC, supplanted Birmingham City in his affections and he became a regular sight, at both home and away matches, until a year or so before his death.</p> <p>Upon his retirement, more and more of his time was taken up with unstinting and uncomplaining care for Jos\u00e9, who suffered from MS and had a succession of strokes before her death in 2005.</p>",

Many agree with him.</p> <p>This prejudice denies many the tools we'd need to escape poverty; consider that 80% of the world's disabled live in poverty, and most estimates state over 90% of children with disabilities in the developing world <a href=\"http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=32969&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html\">do not go to school</a>.

We had parents who believed in us and encouraged us to aim high. My Dad has told me of the many questions he was asked by friends and family on his decision to support my education. He could have invested all his time and money on my siblings, as they thought I was not a good enough investment venture due to my disability.</p> <p>We work with AbleChildAfrica to give other young people with disabilities the same encouragement, aspiration and opportunities we were lucky enough to receive.

They can then graduate to internships or receive support to develop a business plan and access start-up credit.

  "<p>The public inquiry into the fatal shooting by Metropolitan police of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/03/azelle-rodney-shot-six-times\" title=\"\">Azelle Rodney</a> opened on Monday. This is the first time a public inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act has been commissioned to examine a death involving police use of lethal force \u2013 such deaths are normally scrutinised at an inquest in front of a jury.</p> <p>Susan Alexander, Rodney's mother, together with the other members of his family, have already waited more than seven years for answers to their questions. Rodney was shot six times at point blank range while sitting in a car that had been stopped by officers. After his death, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) conducted an investigation and a file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). In July 2006 the CPS announced that there was \"insufficient evidence\" for a realistic prospect of convicting an over the shooting. After this decision, the family was told by the coroner that a full inquest could not be held because large portions of the police officers' statements had been crossed out, probably under the law which excludes information obtained by intercept from being used as evidence or even being seen by coroners. After years of parliamentary wrangling it was <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100330-wms0006.htm\" title=\"\">finally announced in March 2010</a> that the public inquiry would be held.</p> <p>There is no dispute that deliberate and lethal force was used, but Susan Alexander needs to know why \u2013 as do the public. It is important that all the essential facts are scrutinised regardless of what they might reveal about Rodney's actions on that day. Ms Alexander wants to hear unsanitised and unedited evidence in order to know why the officer believed it was necessary to shoot her son six times at point blank range on a busy London street.</p> <p>We hope the inquiry will provide answers to specific questions about the reason for the decision to make the arrests, whether the operation was planned and conducted so as to minimise risk of life to all concerned, whether Rodney could have been arrested earlier than the \"hard stop\" that evening \u2013 and if he could have been, why did this not happen?</p> <p>Other fatal shootings by police have raised questions about possible operational and intelligence failings; we hope that this inquiry, with its wider remit and greater resources than is usual at an inquest, will examine some of these issues. These include the practice of police officers \"pooling their recollections\" and what, if any, internal investigation was conducted by the Metropolitan Police Service.</p> <p>The inquiry is due to conclude in December with the chairman's report delivered to ministers early next year. In his opening statement, counsel to the inquiry, Ashley Underwood QC, described how the inquiry team hoped that they have found a solution to protect the source of sensitive evidence of central relevance to the question of how Rodney met his death that will enable the inquiry to be fully in public. There is a lot depending on this hope, as Alexander has lost out on the important role played by inquest juries, who act as a proper check and balance on the powers of state agents. It is vitally important that this inquiry provides robust, far-reaching scrutiny of the circumstances of Rodney's death and ensures those responsible are held to account.</p>",

  "<p><em>Here is the concluding part of my afterword in the second and updated edition of <strong>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial,*</strong> in which I seek to place phone hacking in some sort of historical perspective.</em></p> <p><em>Yesterday's extract dealt with the methods employed by journalists from the 1950s onwards. Today, I pick up the story in the 1980s...</em> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395613399\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346741783090/Hacking.book.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"219\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In the immediate aftermath of the 1986 Wapping revolution there was a period of what can only be described as Wild West behaviour. It was led by the News of the World's daily sister, The Sun. </p> <p>There was the 1987 libel of the singer Elton John and the false story suggesting that Liverpool football fans had been responsible for the deaths of 96 people in the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy. </p> <p>A Sun feature by Piers Morgan about the sexual proclivities of various male singers was headlined \"The poofs of pop.\"</p> <p>There was an even further push into darker territory, exemplified by the treatment of the dying television personality, Russell Harty, in 1988. Photographers desperate to snatch pictures of him in his hospital bed trained long lenses on his room after renting a flat across the road. </p> <p>In the weeks beforehand, the News of the World had sought to \"out\" Harty as a gay man with Aids. In his address at Harty's memorial service, the playwright Alan Bennett referred to \"the gutter press\". </p> <p>More examples of bad and ugly journalism in this era were detailed in a book by one of the leading commentators of the period, Ray Snoddy, who also hosted a Channel 4 television series, <em>Hard News</em>, which turned the tables on newspapers by investigating their investigations. It ran for two years from 1987.</p> <p>Many thousands of words have been written about the press pursuit of Diana, Princess of Wales, throughout her marriage to Prince Charles until her death in 1997 in a Paris underpass with paparazzi following her car. </p> <p>I witnessed two occasions towards the end of her life when packs of photographers goaded her in order to obtain saleable \"candid\" shots. It is fair to say that she was guilty of intruding into her own privacy on occasion, but it is blindingly obvious why she felt it necessary to make a pact with the devil.</p> <p>Brian MacArthur, the founding editor of the short-lived middle market tabloid Today who went on to be a leading commentator on the press, summed up the history of royal reporting:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The story of the tabloids and the royal family has been one in which new depths have been plumbed every few years \u2013 from photographs of a holidaying and pregnant Diana to Squidgygate and Camillagate \u2013 both of which involved intercepted phone calls, but in which newspapers were not themselves agents of the interception.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He told of rival royal reporters bugging each other and their paying of people in order to discover the family's travelling arrangements. MacArthur, who was noted for his fairness and level head, concluded: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"This is a murky area of Fleet Street pond life, where the rule is not to get caught and where editors plead public interest when they are only feeding the interest of the public.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Diana years were also marked by a significant editorial crossover as the methods and ethos of celebrity journalism started to infect the reporting of other spheres. And the reverse happened too. </p> <p>Celebrities, a term used to include almost anyone with a public profile, were subjected to the kinds of well-resourced investigative journalism usually reserved for matters of significant public interest. </p> <p>In very different ways, these practices were revealed, and extolled, by three former News of the World journalists \u2013 the investigative reporter, Gerry Brown; the TV editor Sharon Marshall; and the newspaper's editor for a year in the mid-1990s, Piers Morgan. </p> <p>Marshall's anecdotal book should not be taken too seriously, but, in evidence to the Leveson inquiry she explained that she quit the newspaper after refusing to carry out a story that would have breached the editors' code of practice. The executive who made the request was not disciplined. </p> <p>A single sentence by Marshall during her appearance spoke volumes about the pressures on all tabloid reporters: \"You're only as good as your next byline.\" It was a reminder of the hierarchical nature of popular papers. They are not democracies. In newsrooms, the editor's word is law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395613400\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346742097293/Hack.Flyer.jpg\" alt=\"fly\" width=\"250\" height=\"142\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The middle 1990s marked the beginning of a much more pro-active form of tabloid investigative journalism, notably at the News of the World. That newspaper had used covert tape-recording and filming as far back as the 1960s. Its reporters, usually a man and woman working together, had also grown accustomed to going undercover to expose sleazy stories of allegedly illicit sex.</p> <p>But improvements in technology, enabling the concealment of pinhole cameras, combined with a much more aggressive use of subterfuge, gave rise to a plethora of so-called sting operations.</p> <p>The master of this art was Mazher Mahmood, who was appointed as the News of the World's investigations editor. His penchant for dressing up in Arab robes gave him a nickname he was happy to adopt, the Fake Sheikh.</p> <p>His entrapments of celebrities, minor members of the royal family and sportsmen won him awards. He also used his skills to expose people traffickers, illegal immigrants, drug-dealers and a variety of low-level criminals. </p> <p>But his methods were hugely controversial and led to bitter criticism from his victims, several other journalists, lawyers and, occasionally, judges. There were suspicions - strenuously denied - that he sometimes used agents provocateurs to set up crimes that resulted in his exclusive stories.</p> <p>And then came hacking. Seen in the context of a 50-year history of escalating misconduct, it can now be seen as a natural development rather than a one-off. It was not an aberration, as popular paper editors wish Leveson to believe. It was the culmination of a long-run process.</p> <p>Since 2006, when the News of the World's royal editor, Clive Goodman, and its contracted private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were arrested, everyone has sought to distance themselves from any involvement in hacking. </p> <p>Now that people have been charged I cannot write more on the details of the affair at this stage. But I think it's entirely fair to say, on the basis of my researches and conversations, that hacking was not viewed as an extraordinary activity. </p> <p>It was seen as just another way of confirming story tips or obtaining stories. In the vernacular, it was just another part of \"the game,\" not a matter of genuine internal concern.</p> <p>So let me finish by considering the overarching reason for a half century of increasingly aggressive news-gathering by British popular newspapers. Ownership, when reduced to its essentials, is all about profits or propaganda, and usually both. </p> <p>All editorial content, whether serving one or the other, derives from those<br>objectives. That is just one reason why the argument by proprietors that their private ownership of newspapers is the underpinning of press freedom is so hugely problematic.</p> <p>There are two inescapable facts. First, the London-based national press is the world's most competitive. It has been marked throughout its history by intense rivalry between the publishers and editors of the popular papers, whose major preoccupation has been to build circulations in the belief that the size of their audiences provide them with a mixture of political, social, cultural and commercial influence. And, of course, profits. </p> <p>Second, for the best part of 30 years, all the 20 or so titles that compose that national press have been suffering from declining sales, a decline that has accelerated in the past 10 years. Meanwhile, advertising revenue has fallen off a cliff due to the current recession and an insistent migration to the internet. Profits have therefore been much harder to come by.</p> <p>It would be overly simplistic to say that this dire commercial reality is the sole reason for editorial misbehaviour on the scale I have described. But it undoubtedly played a role in the way in which publishers, notably Rupert Murdoch, were prepared to turn a blind eye to ethical standards in order to maximise the sales \u2013 and profits \u2013 of their newspapers.</p> <p>That's why I conclude, just as I concluded my evidence to the Leveson<br>inquiry, by quoting an observation in an essay by one of my City University London students: \"Most ethical dilemmas in the media are a struggle between conscience and revenue.\"</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> <strong>Harry Evans</strong> explores \"the relationship of mutual antagonism\" between journalists and politicians, one that is \"moderated by mutual dependency\"</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, will be published by Abramis on 17 September</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday I was given an enormous honour and great responsibility in being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/03/green-party-natalie-bennett-leader\" title=\"\">elected as the leader of the Green party</a> of England and Wales.</p> <p>This is a time of tremendous opportunity for the Green party. Voters across Britain are seeking new answers \u2013 they want to know why in the world's sixth-richest economy, millions feel insecure, frightened about the future, worried about their children's future.</p> <p>They know that after decades of growth based on the financial and retail industries, with a long-hours working culture and growing job insecurity, Britain has the unhappiest children in the developed world, that levels of mental illness and stress are extremely high, that huge numbers of people are not sure they can keep a roof over their heads.</p> <p>And they know that our entire economy is based on treating the Earth as though it were a mine and a dumping ground, and the poor as though they were rubbish.</p> <p>They understand that the 20th-century approach of neoliberalism and globalisation, of outsourcing and financial speculation, cannot continue. The model is broken.</p> <p>Yet the Labour party, which was so relaxed about people getting \"filthy rich,\" which was so keen to outsource NHS services and encourage academy schools, hasn't changed its tune \u2013 it just wants to cut a little more slowly than the coalition.</p> <p>Only the Green party has the vision of radical change. It understands that we need to invest in the future, to invest in housing, in jobs, in energy conservation and renewable energy.</p> <p>Cuts are only throwing more people on to unemployment benefits \u2013 what we need to do is create jobs and provide essential services \u2013 health, social care, education and social housing. And to fund that investment we need to collect a proper level of taxes from multinational companies and rich individuals, not cut tax rates and allow them to hide billions in tax havens.</p> <p>That investment can restructure our economy to prepare for a low-carbon world, relocalise our manufacturing industries and food supplies, make Britain a leader in renewable energy and create jobs, opportunities and security. We can build all of this around a financial industry that's fit for that purpose, based on credit unions, mutuals and small local banks.</p> <p>Rather than giant multinationals, we need to encourage co-operatives and small businesses rooted in their communities and meeting their needs. And we need to ensure that the law allows unions a significant role in the workplace \u2013 an important corrective to our current low-pay, casualised workplaces.</p> <p>The Green party also accepts that we need to acknowledge that some people in society will need a helping hand, some of the time or all of their lives. Benefits are an essential support in a decent society, and they should be at levels that allow a proper standard of living. The demonisation of benefit recipients, the grossly unfair Atos disability tests, the slashing of disability living allowance all stand as testament to the wrong directions we have been taking.</p> <p>The Green party thus offers a new answer to voters seeking it \u2013 and so this is a time of tremendous political opportunity.</p> <p>We finished as clearly the third party in the recent London elections. In the West Midlands, to take just one example, we've been growing fast in numbers of councillors, and after the election of Caroline Lucas as MP in Brighton Pavilion in 2010, we've shown we can win first-past-the-post elections at all levels.</p> <p>In my two-year term as leader, I will be aiming to help get many more Greens elected on to councils around England and Wales, and to see us trebling our number of MEPs in 2014, meaning many more voters have at least one elected Green representative. That will be a foundation stone for the 2015 Westminster elections and beyond.</p> <p>We are seeing many Lib Dem voters come to us, but we also know that the Labour vote is very soft \u2013 many who might vote for the party of Blair/Brown/Miliband when they think they are the only alternative are delighted to shift their vote to the Greens when they realise they have the option.</p> <p>It's clear we are in troubled times, but the Green message is that we can emerge stronger, with a more equal, fair and balanced society \u2013 and a better quality of life for everyone.</p>",
  "<p>Having grown up reading Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl, I can safely say that even now I was looking forward to reading the last instalment of the series. As a child I was an ardent fan of Colfer's. I travelled across the country to meet him at various signings and this was all due to the writer's knack of understanding the young mind. His use of comedy was a notch above his contemporaries and he wrote his characters for children with a flare that only J.K Rowling could match. The series was something I attached very heavily to my own childhood and so approaching this book I had tremendous expectations. After all, since I had read the previous instalment I had begun to read some of the best fiction ever written and had just finished Tolstoy's Anna Karenina before I started Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian. I was hesitant that, now being older, the series wouldn't have the same magical grasp on me as it did in my younger years. But when I finished the final page I realised I had nothing to worry about.</p> <p>Artemis Fowl, teenage genius, is undergoing therapy after his recent battle with the fairy disorder, the Atlantis Complex. Soon, however, power-crazy Opal Kobai has returned with a master plan that will destroy the entire human race. It's Armageddon and this time Artemis Fowl doesn't have a plan. Will he, along with friends Holly Short, Mulch Diggums and Butler, be able to stop Opal, or is this the end for Artemis Fowl as we know it?</p> <p>Fast-paced is not even the word to describe Colfer's storyline here. It moves with such speed that readers won't be able to stop and take a break. Nevertheless, Colfer has complete control over the plot and writes with such alacrity that this is one of his best works. His characters are written in so much depth, that it is easy for readers to empathise with their struggles and this is so refreshing to read when so many children's novels today lack the same resonance. One cannot fault the humour, which is both witty and sarcastic and will have readers laughing all the way. It is interlaced perfectly into the action and prevents the story from getting too dark or serious for younger readers. Overall, Colfer's writing style is faultless and by the end, readers will be able to see how he is a master at entertaining his target audiences.</p> <p>So is Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian a fitting end to Colfer's highly-appraised series? The answer to this is yes. The ending maybe predictable for older readers, but it still carries a great deal of emotion. Fans may be disappointed that the series ends with a few unanswered questions, but the climax is so well-penned that it is almost poetic. There is a great deal of catharsis as the novel closes and I am sure that many readers would have grown up with Artemis Fowl like I have and the ending is a fitting tribute to a series which has given its audiences so much pleasure. Let us hope that the series has the power to stand the test of time and will thus continue to delight readers for generations to come. </p> <p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site </a>and send us your review!</strong></p>",
  "<p>It is a likable commonplace that \"everyone has a book in them\". There is some truth residing in there somewhere: surely no human life, properly observed, is uninteresting. The problem lies in the telling \u2013 it's hard to write a readable book, much less a good one \u2013 and it has led many people to observe that, if everyone has a book in them, that is where it should stay.</p> <p>From a writer's point of view, though, we have numbers of books within us: competing and often inchoate ideas as to what might be possible. Anything can catalyse a book: a snatch of overheard conversation, a dream or memory, a story that needs telling or retelling, a shadowy narrative that slowly shapes and reshapes itself as it is inwardly contemplated. Some of these ideas come to fruition, but most, for a variety of reasons, never do.</p> <p>There are two books I wish I had written, which are on a similar subject, and were prompted by a comment made by an American tennis player during a post-match Wimbledon interview. <a href=\"http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Ma/T/Todd-Martin.aspx\" title=\"\">Todd Martin</a> is hardly remembered now, but in the 1990s he rose to number four in the world. He was, in his quietly spoken, clean-cut frat-boy manner, America's equivalent to Tim Henman. In 1994, he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BELbFMng6GY&amp;feature=relmfu\" title=\"\">reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon where he lost to Pete Sampras</a> \u2013 then at the top of his game \u2013 in four sets.</p> <p>Afterwards, Martin was interviewed by the BBC and faced with the earnest question: how devastated was he, having got so close to the final? (Sports interviewers usually supply the answer with the question \u2013 \"This is one of the best days of your life, isn't it?\" \u2013 presumably to absolve the sporting hero from having to think.) But thinking, to my surprise, was something Martin was rather good at. As I remember it, the conversation went like this.</p> <p>\"Not at all,\" he said. \"I got to the semi-finals at Wimbledon. I lost to one of the greatest players the game has ever seen. I consider that a success \u2026\"</p> <p>\"But to have got so close?\"</p> <p>\"You have to understand,\" said the mild Martin with something close to asperity, \"losing is what I do. I have only won a few tournaments in my professional career. So when I get this deep into the tournament, that is the most I can reasonably hope for, and I am pleased about it.\"</p> <p>Unable to make anything sensible of this, the interviewer, looking both disappointed and disapproving, shut things down, and the large, sweaty Martin ambled off contentedly to the shower.</p> <p>\"Losing is what I do.\" It was a sentiment that located something true, and \u2013 unless you're as smart and emotionally mature as Todd Martin \u2013 cruel about professional sport. Because for every winner, there are myriads, thousands, tens of thousands, of losers, and in our fixation with who wins we blind ourselves to the stories \u2013 the spectacle, the drama \u2013 of those supremely talented athletes who do not. Usain Bolt can't run by himself \u2013 he has to beat slower people. Nor can we simply announce in advance that the semi-finalists at the next grand slam tennis tournament will be Murray, Nadal, Federer, and Djokovic, though they most likely will be. They have to beat a bunch of people first. The job of those people is to make sure that Mr Murray does not play Mr Nadal until it is seemly to do so.</p> <p>I am interested in losers. After all, by the highest standards, it's what most of us are. Lacking supreme talent, we do the best we can, and that is often pretty good. As a tennis player I peaked as an Oxford blue, but would never have qualified for Wimbledon. As a writer I produce an occasional sentence, and even more rarely a paragraph, that seems to me unimpeachable, but I will never write as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/johnbanville\" title=\"\">John Banville</a>. I am typical of the sort of modestly talented all-rounder whose life-job is going to be to reconcile himself to the limitations of his abilities. Like Todd Martin (only less so), most of us are here to lose at the best level we can manage.</p> <p>I was so struck by Martin's remarks that I approached my then-publishers with a suggestion that I write a book about tennis which, instead of being about Sampras or Agassi, would focus on the lesser lights of the tennis world. Watch a first round match at Wimbledon between two players you have never heard of, and you will be astonished at the extraordinary skills on display. How could such players not win more tournaments? Each of them \u2013 every player who makes it to the highest level \u2013 was once, at six or 10 or 13 years old, the best damn player, the most promising, the most devastating, that anyone in their school, neighbourhood, community, county, state, had ever seen. They were, almost all of them, prodigies, with expectations to match. And, maybe 10 years later, they still have the gifts, but no longer the victories.</p> <p>How does this feel? How do you accommodate to such reduced expectations and results? How many of these losers have the grace and the intelligence to see themselves, like Martin, as the kind of mitigated success that most people never dream of? Nobody is encouraged to dream of themselves as a Wimbledon semi-finalist. No, reach for the sky! Imagine yourself a winner!</p> <p>It is, for many who are thus counselled, catastrophic advice, and it must have interesting consequences.</p> <p>But the publishers rejected my proposal immediately. \"Nobody cares about losers,\" I was told. \"Write a book about a winner!\" (Some years later the excellent <a href=\"http://www.feinsteinonthebrink.com/\" title=\"\">John Feinstein</a> wrote exactly such a book about the journeymen of the US PGA golf tour, and it did very well).</p> <p>Still interested in my aper\u00e7u about losing, however, I approached the chairman of my local football club, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/coventry\" title=\"\">Coventry City</a>, and got permission to write a behind-the-scenes account of the 1997-98 season. The resulting book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/sportandleisure/9780751528596/staying-up\" title=\"\">Staying Up</a>, charted the lives of the players, coaches, managers and chairman of a club whose modest expectations were met by the mere fact of year-by-year survival. My teenage son and I were season-ticket holders, and I argued to him, in his moments of discouragement, that Coventry City are the best possible role models. Do pretty well, even if you lose more than you win, and keep your pecker (and Premiership status) up.</p> <p>This eventually got me thinking about <a href=\"http://colinmontgomerie.com/\" title=\"\">Colin Montgomerie</a>, seven-time winner of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour#Order_of_Merit_winners\" title=\"\">European Tour order of merit</a>, but also labelled \"the best player not to have won a major\". Though he insisted he was satisfied with his lot, it must have been a crushing disappointment. Would he talk about this? Though clearly thoughtful and intelligent, he had a habit of shooting his mouth off when he was upset, which happened a lot. Would he not welcome a chance to show himself as (I presumed) he really was, and to co-operate in a book that I called Monty at the Majors?</p> <p>The idea was simple: the next year, at the next four \"major\" tournaments (the Masters, US Open, the Open, and PGA) I would follow Monty round the course, observe every shot, talk to him after each round, and record what he was thinking and feeling under the highest pressure, as he attempted, at last, to win a big one. It would give him, I argued in my proposal, a chance to display his analytical and emotional powers: all he had to do was talk to me frankly during the year, and at the end feel free to edit the final manuscript and cut out anything he thought inappropriate.</p> <p>I sent him a copy of Staying Up, which he apparently enjoyed, but he turned down my proposal on the grounds that he didn't want a book written about him during his playing career. Monty's agents, the behemoth IMG, suggested that, instead, I write a similar book about either Bernhard Langer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lee-westwood\" title=\"\">Lee Westwood</a> or Jesper Parnevik, all of them players of very high quality.</p> <p>\"No thanks,\" I said. \"I'm not a sports writer. I am interested in Montgomerie as a person, not in those guys.\" I had no intention of spending a year following the earnest Langer, the rather dull boy from Worksop or the flaky Swede.</p> <p>The IMG guys were astonished.</p> <p>\"Are you aware what you are turning down? You will have a top-level entry pass: you'll be inside the ropes, in the locker room and the restaurant! Right there next to the players! With Tiger! There's nothing like it!\"</p> <p>\"No thanks,\" I said.</p> <p>That was stupid of me. Right there, at the Masters! I can hardly watch it on TV now, year after year, without an acute pang of regret.</p>",
  "<p>Some weeks ago I wrote about the problem of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/aug/15/parents-dying-children-praying\" title=\"\">children being 'tortured' to death in high-tech hospitals</a> because their religious parents won't agree to let them die. This was brought out <a href=\"http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/03/08/medethics-2011-100104\" title=\"\">by a piece in the Journal of Medical Ethics</a>, co-authored by two doctors at Great Ormond Street and the hospital's Anglican chaplain.</p> <p>These decisions must quite frequently be made: the paper mentions that 70% of the children who die in Great Ormond Street hospital intensive care unit do so as a result of the withdrawal of medical treatment.

The cases in which parents object are obviously a very small minority, and those where the objections are both religious and carried to the point of an argument in court are even smaller: six cases in three years, out of a total of 290 deaths.</p> <p>One thing that stands out is that there is a pretty complete breakdown of relations with specifically African Christian parents: \"In the Christian groups who held fervent or fundamentalist views, the parents did not engage in exploration of their religious beliefs with hospital chaplains and no religious community leaders were available to attend meetings to help discuss or reconcile the differences.\"</p> <p>So I talked about this with Yemi Adedeji, from the Evangelical Alliance, a Nigerian pentecostalist now ordained into the Church of England, who wanted to explain the African view of spirituality.</p> <p>African Christianity, he says, is often built on a foundation of traditional African religion, where everything has a spiritual cause, or dimension.</p> <p>\"The typical African is rooted in one world that doesn't separate the spirit, the body and the soul. So, if the weather is good, it's rooted in their spirituality. If the weather is bad, it's rooted in their spirituality. Nothing happens by chance.</p> <p>\"As a Christian, your first point of contact and the first point of belief is that we believe in God who can heal all infirmities and all diseases, and that's what I preach as a pastor, and that's what I believe. What we do is rooted in our faith, and our faith is rooted in our Bible.\"</p> <p>But at the same time, people keep dying, and Africans know this as well as anyone else. In Adedeji's own church, the pastor's wife had died of cancer despite everyone in her social circle praying for her. So the central problem is not a belief in miracles but how to interpret this belief in any given circumstances. These are people who take very seriously the <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/articles/god-answers-prayers-of-paralyzed-little-boy,475/\" title=\"\">old Onion joke</a> \"God answers prayers of paralysed little boy: 'No,' says God.\" Sometimes, they believe, God does say no.</p> <p>The central question, then, becomes one of discernment. The question of miracles is reframed to become \"What does God want? What is God saying?\" Once this is treated as a real question, one consequence is that the whole community can answer it. And it seems to be there that the problem arises with hospitals. \"Most of the African pentecostal churches operate from a patriarchal mode, and there it is like, whatever the leader says, whether right or wrong, is what the parents will follow. If the leader says 'I think the child will live' that's what the parents will believe.\"</p> <p>The obvious answer, then, is for the hospital to link up with the parents' pastors and discuss the matter that way. But what happens when the pastor does not want to talk?</p> <p>The law is completely clear, and to that extent the question that the JME paper raises is a red herring. In a commentary published alongside the article, the barrister <a href=\"http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/07/13/medethics-2012-100682\" title=\"\">Charles Foster</a> points out:</p> <p>\"The English law in relation to the administration of treatment to children, and the withdrawal of treatment from them, is straightforward: the only lawful treatment is that which is in the child's best interests \u2026 Yes, the views of those holding parental responsibility are sought, but those views do not determine where the child's best interests lie. This is often misunderstood. One hears people talk about a parental veto on proposed treatment or a withdrawal of treatment. There is no such veto \u2026 The authors object to having, at the instance of religiously motivated parents, to continue 'to cause pain and suffering by insisting on care that will not improve or cure the child's condition'. But they don't have to. Indeed it's unlawful.\"</p> <p>But the clarity of the law won't stop these tragedies. What's clear, though, is that simply blaming \"religion\" is pointless. In most cases, thinking of these ghastly sufferings as part of the will of God helps parents come to terms with them. The part of Job's comforters is sometimes played by smug believers, but nowadays it's just as often played by unbelievers, smugly confident that a child's death demonstrates the indifference of the universe and the random character of other people's anguish.</p>",
  "<p>It is difficult to feel confident about the care and support white paper. This is not just because of the lack of funding to deliver its aspirations, but because it fails to address the challenges facing social care workers.</p> <p>Both the white paper and the draft bill that would enact it recognise people who use care and support services as individuals who deserve a personalised approach. What the <a href=\"http://www.socialcareassociation.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Care Association</a> (SCA) has been trying to get strategists to acknowledge is that care workers must be recognised as individuals in the same way.</p> <p>Achievement of most, if not all, of the stated outcomes for service users will depend on another human being. In many cases, this will be an informal, unpaid carer. They are widely referenced in the documents and their position will undoubtedly improve if the bill is enacted. Similarly, in full \"big society\" mode, there will be money available to develop community capacity to deliver the extras that make good support excellent through local volunteer programmes.</p> <p>However, with 76% of us likely to need some kind of care and support in later life, it is inevitable that paid care workers will continue to play a central role. Yet the white paper pays them scant attention other than almost passing references to \"workforce\".</p> <p>The focus under both the current and last governments on development of personal budgets, direct payments, shared lives support models and so on has meant this previously \"wholesale\" workforce is being dismantled into the \"retail\" response model required by these kinds of service. Cost reductions being achieved through these models are primarily savings from the infrastructure that monitors, controls and supports service delivery.</p> <p>In response to this, the sector's trade unions are the weakest they have been for many years. And even when the <a href=\"http://www.basw.co.uk/\" title=\"\">British Association of Social Workers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.collegeofsocialwork.org/\" title=\"\">the College of Social Work</a> finally get their act together, they will assist only a tiny fraction \u2013 perhaps 8% - of all social care workers.</p> <p>There are a few relatively small professional bodies, of which the SCA is one, attempting to support the other 92%. As far as I know, none of us has been included in any of the quality initiative groups mentioned in the white paper and draft bill. Corporate trade bodies and more powerful lobbyists have of course been included, yet it is the paid social care workers \u2013 currently more than 1.5 million individuals \u2013 who will be the key to delivering this agenda.</p> <p>We had hoped also that the Department of Health would seek to know the social care market in the same way that Sir David Nicholson, NHS chief executive, knows and maintains weekly contact with the health service. The market is, after all, bigger in numbers than the NHS and not so long ago we were being prepared by a Labour government for creation of a national care service.</p> <p>The reality is that if the department's social care division was a bank, it would be in trouble for its lack of control. It does not have the most basic information about whom we are dealing with \u2013 who the customer base is \u2013 even via its arm's length regulator.</p> <p>When failures occur, the workers concerned are (quite rightly) rounded on and pilloried. But when the dust settles, they become the \"workforce\" again. The veterinary nurse who looks after your cat is better regulated and trained, as standard, than the person taking care of your grandmother with dementia \u2013 there's a thought. Oh, and they are probably better paid.</p> <p><em>Nick Johnson is chief executive of the Social Care Association</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Bashful and skittish, the Kaiser's spotted newt is intriguing and beautiful. With only around 1,000 adults left in the wild in just four mountain streams in Iran, it is also critically endangered.</p> <p>But the black, white and orange salamanders are openly on sale for as little as \u00a365 on numerous websites. While these may have been bred in captivity, they are descended from rare individuals taken from the wild, and investigators have identified dealers who say their stocks come from Iran.</p> <p>Two years ago the Kaiser's spotted newt was listed as one of the first species to be put at risk of extinction by online dealers. Now conservationists are warning that the internet is fueling unprecedented levels of illegal wildlife trade and that for many species this is now the principal threat to their survival.</p> <p>A report due to be published later this year concludes that a growing proportion of wildlife crime is using \"deep web\" tools more commonly associated with serious financial criminals, drug traffickers and child pornographers.</p> <p>\"The internet has without a doubt facilitated the huge expansion of illegal international wildlife trading over the last decade,\" said Crawford Allan, of the wildlife trade monitoring network <a href=\"http://www.traffic.org/\" title=\"\">Traffic</a>. \"Rare jewels of the forest can now be caught, boxed and shipped almost overnight just like any other express commodity.\"</p> <p>It is a wide-ranging business. Elephant ivory is used for ornaments, and parts of tigers and rhinos are used in traditional medicine or ground down and added to wine. Pelts from leopards and polar bears fetch high sums, while rare reptiles, birds and fish are bought as pets.</p> <p>There are no precise figures on the scale of the problem. Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-based lobby group, <a href=\"http://www.gfintegrity.org/storage/gfip/documents/reports/transcrime/gfi_transnational_crime_web.pdf\" title=\"\">last year estimated</a> the global illegal wildlife trade to be worth at least \u00a35bn. Various reporting systems and investigations suggest commercial exploitation of many at risk species has reached \u2013 or is close to \u2013 all-time high.</p> <p>Protected live animals and body parts are still traded in shops and markets in cities such as Bangkok and Jakarta, however much of the business is now handled online by middlemen using varying degrees of secrecy.</p> <p>Previous investigations have found a lot of trade taking place relatively openly on auction sites, via classified ads and in enthusiast chat rooms. Products from rhino, tigers and elephants are often advertised as historical artefacts without documentary proof. Animals caught in the wild are described as captive bred. Acronyms, mis-spellings and code words are used to evade detection.</p> <p>\"Once you know the terminology and you know how to search, then a lot of it is pretty open,\" said <a href=\"http://www.vincentnijman.org/\" title=\"\">Vincent Nijman</a>, a researcher at Oxford Brookes University who has studied the trade.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.ifaw.org/sites/default/files/Report%202007%20Bidding%20for%20Extinction.pdf\" title=\"\">investigation by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)</a> highlighted the sale of 2,275 elephant ivory items on eight different eBay websites in a single week in 2007. The site subsequently banned such sales, but conservationists say sellers simply avoid using the word \"ivory\" in item descriptions.</p> <p>In August, for example, a search on eBay's UK site for \"ox bone\" \u2013 widely used as a euphemism for elephant ivory \u2013 yielded more than 5,000 results. An eBay spokesman told the Guardian: \"eBay works closely with conservation groups such as the IFAW and goes beyond legal requirements to restrict the sale of ivory products on the marketplaces site. The eBay trust and safety team proactively enforces eBay's policy on ivory products and works quickly to take action to remove listings of items of concern.\"</p> <p>In 2008 <a href=\"http://www.ifaw.org/sites/default/files/FINAL%20Killing%20with%20Keystrokes%202.0%20report%202011.pdf\" title=\"\">IFAW identified</a> more than 7,000 wildlife products from threatened species being offered for sale in dozens of online auctions, forums and classified ads. Last year it found ivory worth \u00a3500,000 for sale on 43 sites based in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Portugal.</p> <p>International trade in wildlife is regulated by the <a href=\"http://www.cites.org/\" title=\"\">Cites convention</a>. Exploitation of around 800 threatened species is largely banned, while both exporting and importing many others requires permits.</p> <p>A forthcoming report from Traffic, the wildlife trade monitoring network, will reveal how researchers in Canada received emails from dealers offering to export coral without required permits by pretending the specimens were glass.</p> <p>IFAW, which has been working with Interpol, says organised wildlife criminals are becoming increasingly secretive online. The \"deep web\" has long been used by criminals in other spheres to evade law enforcement. Sites that are not accessible via search engines and which require software to access are used. Communications are bounced through large numbers of computers to maintain anonymity.</p> <p>\"Online wildlife trade is seen as a high-profit, low-risk activity by some criminals,\" said Kelvin Alfie of IFAW. \"A lot is shifting from publicly accessible sites to dark corners of the web.\"</p> <p>A report on the ivory trade in the EU to be published later this year by IFAW will highlight the use of tools such as mailing list servers, password-protected sites and encryption.</p> <p>National and international laws to control the trade often pre-date the online trade, and the internet has made the jobs of those trying to enforce the law and protect wildlife even harder.</p> <p>However some say the net can also be used against wildlife criminals. While it helped Kaiser spotted newt dealers to find buyers, the online traces they left alerted investigators to the existence of the trade.</p> <p>\"It works both ways,\" said Ernie Cooper, also of Traffic. \"The internet has made it easier for traders, but it has also helped us research and monitor their activities.\"</p>",
  "<p>The elections taking place across Africa this year present an opportunity for a rising tide of women to take political office. An enouraging precedent was set a few weeks ago, when the proportion of women in Senegal's parliament swelled from 22% to 43%. But without action to tackle the barriers that keep women out of power, the great wave of equality may amount to no more than a trickle.</p> <p>Those barriers are many and varied: economic dependency; limited access to education and information; discriminatory cultural and social attitudes, and negative stereotypes; the burden of domestic responsibility; and intimidation, harassment and violence.</p> <p>Any step change in women's political representation in the past decade has usually been down to the use of candidate quotas. This made the difference in Senegal, and it has made a difference elsewhere. In 1995, just seven parliaments had reached the \"critical mass\" of 30% female representation, but in 2010 that figure stood at 44. Tellingly, 20 of the 26 most equal parliaments used electoral quotas or reserved seats. In 2009, almost 50 countries held elections; in those that implemented quotas, women took 27% of the seats on average, compared to <a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/bookshop/ids-bulletin/ids-bulletin-41-2010\" title=\"\">14% in countries that didn't</a>.</p> <p>Quotas are an effective way of levelling the playing field. Compensatory rather than discriminatory, they help women overcome structural inequality. It's also about reaching a tipping point where women's voices are loud enough to influence decisions and set the agenda, something virtually impossible for a token woman in a male-dominated political system.</p> <p>\"Little drops of water make an ocean,\" says Hannah Koroma, national co-ordinator of Woman Against Violence and Exploitation in Society (Waves) in Sierra Leone. Koroma emphasises the practical benefits of critical mass: \"Women have been terrified by senior male authorities in some constituencies in past elections, and in the end those women have had to step down for fear of their lives. This new system, if actualised, will ensure women's security and safety to exercise their franchise.\"</p> <p>Waves and other women's organisations across Sierra Leone are campaigning to get the government to approve a law that would reserve 30% of seats for women candidates. They feel this is the only way to address the fact that only 13.2% of the seats in the national parliament are held by women. But as Koroma explains, there's a risk that the gender equality bill won't be passed in time for November's elections. In addition, the National Election Commission of Sierra Leone has <a href=\"http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200520807.shtml\" title=\"\">proposed raising candidate fees</a> from 250,000 leones (approximately \u00a336) in 2007 to 25m leones (about \u00a33,687). The Human Rights Commission has condemned the move, as widespread poverty means many men and women will be excluded from office if these changes go ahead. But women will be hit hardest, since they are less likely to have access to financial resources.</p> <p>Lowering nomination fees can have an enormous impact on female representation at local and national level. Thanks to advocacy by, among others, <a href=\"http://www.womankind.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Womankind Worldwide</a>'s partner, <a href=\"http://www.wildaf.org/\" title=\"\">Women in Law and Development in Africa (Wildaf)</a>, Ghana's five main political parties have this year reduced nomination fees for women by 50%; the number of women standing in political party elections and primaries has already increased.</p> <p>Female parliamentarians add vital perspectives to the democratic process, and can stimulate a step change for the advancement of women's rights, bringing attention to issues affecting women in their constituencies and proving that women are more than qualified to act as decisionmakers.</p> <p>In some west African cultures and traditions, women have exercised power and even become chiefs. But often their influence has been symbolic and restricted to the upholding of tradition. Traditional female leaders have often not had the same access to education as their male counterparts, making the transition to formal politics more difficult.</p> <p>And female chiefs are by no means widely accepted. In 2009, <a href=\"http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=1&amp;num=13951&amp;printer=1\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Torto stood in a chieftancy election</a> in the Kono district of Sierra Leone. The intimidation and harassment she received from the powerful all-male \"poro\" society in her village eventually meant she had to be flown to safety in a UN helicopter, which was pelted with stones.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/16/senegal-headway-gender-equality\" title=\"\">backlash against female MPs in Senegal shows</a>, it's not plain sailing once women have reached parliament. Women in public positions are frequently sidelined and undermined by their own parties and colleagues, subject to misogynist attacks in the press, verbal harassment, and even physical violence.</p> <p>It's not enough to push a wave of women into politics, they must be supported by cultural change, and women's organisations are using innovative approaches to make this happen. As an example, Wildaf in Ghana has found that educating the whole community about representation and accountability has improved openness to what female candidates have to say.</p> <p>Quotas are just the start. As Koroma says: \"A journey begins with a footstep \u2013 give women in Sierra Leone a chance to start this journey.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Boccia: 3.45pm ExCeL</strong></h2> <p>The third day of boccia competition will see the first medals awarded, with Greece and South Korea the favourites to reach the final of the BC3 pairs. The Greeks won at last year's World Cup in Belfast, where the Koreans suffered a shock reverse to Portugal in the quarter-finals, and boast the No1-ranked Grigoris Polychronidis, who will be looking to improve on his individual silver medal from Beijing. Britain are favourites to win the BC1-2 team event (5.50pm).</p> <h2><strong>Equestrian: 3.45pm Greenwich Park</strong></h2> <p>The final equestrian event of the Olympic and Paralympic Games will be the grade 1a (the classification for athletes with the most serious impairments) freestyle test. Britain's Sophie Christiansen, who won her first medal, a bronze, in Athens as a 16-year-old, took gold in Beijing and will be back to defend her title.</p> <h2><strong>Wheelchair fencing: 6.30pm ExCeL</strong></h2> <p>Hungary's Pal Szekeres is the only athlete to have won medals at both the Olympic and Paralympic Games, having taken a bronze in Seoul in 1988 three years before he suffered significant spinal damage in a bus accident. He won world championship gold in a wheelchair that same year, and has since won three Paralympic golds (the last in 1996) and three bronze medals.</p> <h2><strong>Contender: </strong>Danielle Brown, archery, 4pm</h2> <p>The reigning world and European champion is looking to defend her Olympic title in London. The 24-year-old has been preoccupied with completing a law degree at the University of Leicester but is confident of yet more glory at the Games.</p> <p><strong>1: </strong>The minimum amount of medals that Team GB should claim in Paralympic shooting. Great Britain has won at least one shooting medal at every games since Toronto 1976, when the sport was first introduced.

  "<p>It is the new delicacy of choice among Vietnam's high-rollers. When the young, fashionable and rich gather to party, they increasingly spice up their drink with a special ingredient: rhino horn powder.</p> <p>These status-conscious hedonists include men who believe that rhino horn can enhance their sexual performance. They apparently know or care little that, thousands of miles away, their obsession could one day drive a glorious animal to extinction.</p> <p>Between 1990 and 2005, poachers in South Africa killed an average of 14 rhinos a year. Since then the number has soared. In 2010, 333 rhinos were poached. In 2011, it was 448. So far this year, <a href=\"http://www.sanparks.org/about/news/default.php?id=55267\" title=\"\">339 rhinos have been killed</a> for their horn, putting 2012 on course to be the deadliest since records began.</p> <p>\"Losing 500 a year, when it used to be 12 or 14 a year, is a crisis,\" said Tom Milliken, east and southern Africa director of the wildlife trade monitoring network <a href=\"http://www.traffic.org/east-and-southern-africa\" title=\"\">Traffic</a>. \"Rhino horn is fetching the highest prices I've ever seen in my career.\"</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/trafficrhinoreportsummary.pdf\" title=\"\">Traffic report</a>, co-authored by Milliken and published last month, blames \"a deadly combination of institutional lapses, corrupt wildlife industry professionals and Asian crime syndicates\". It identifies four main consumer groups fuelling the demand.</p> <p>\"Belief in rhino horn's detoxification properties, especially following excessive intake of alcohol, rich food and 'the good life', has given rise to an affluent group of habitual users, who routinely mix rhino horn powder with water or alcohol as a general health and hangover-curing tonic,\" the report said. \"There is a strong, socially bonding element to such consumption which typically unfolds at group functions, including so-called 'rhino wine associations' in which other Asian expatriate business elites participate.\"</p> <p>The notion that Asian traditional medicine used rhino horn as an aphrodisiac was a myth of the western media, Milliken said, but now, \"rather incredibly\", he said, it had been embraced by Vietnamese men. \"The myth has come full circle: it has taken on a life of its own.\"</p> <p>A second group of consumers are people who believe another myth: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/20/rhinos-threatened-extinction-cancer-cure\" title=\"\">that rhino horn is a miracle cure for cancer</a>. It is promoted as such by unscrupulous dealers to desperate, often dying people. Milliken said: \"We've had stories of rhino horn touts who go into cancer wards in hospitals with the hard sell.\"</p> <p>By monitoring online chatrooms, Milliken and his team were able to identify a third group: middle-class and wealthy young mothers who keep rhino horn as a home preparation to treat high fever. \"If their child falls ill and other medicines fail, they have it on hand in case of emergency.\"</p> <p>Finally, there are those using it for expensive gifts to curry favour with elites \u2013 rhino horn can be seen as \"the gift of life\". It is sometimes used as an informal currency for luxury products, such as partial payment for a new car.</p> <p>There is little awareness of where the horns come from and by what brutal means. In South Africa, rhinos are usually shot dead by AK-47 assault rifles, the report found, although lately a growing number have died from a single shot from a high-calibre rifle normally associated with wildlife industry professionals. This, along with evidence of helicopters in some incidents, suggests the emergence of \"corrupt game industry insiders\".</p> <p>From the poacher there follows a series of middlemen buyers, exporters and couriers. A courier can travel from Vietnam to South Africa, pack rhino horns into his rucksack and return within 24 hours.</p> <p>South Africa has stepped up anti-poaching measures in Kruger national park and other game reserves, making 192 arrests this year. The Vietnamese government, however, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/vietnam-rhino-horn-poaching-south-africa\" title=\"\">is accused of not taking the crisis seriously,</a> despite pressure from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites).</p> <p>But Do Quang Tung, deputy director of Cites management authority in Vietnam, said Vietnam could not be the main market for South African rhino horn \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.vietnamplus.vn/Home/Rhino-horn-claim-unfounded/20128/28188.vnplus\" title=\"\">\"not even close\"</a>. Vietnamese authorities and conservationists have denied the allegations in the study, saying it is not objective or based on evidence.</p> <p>Milliken said: \"As far as we can tell, there has not been a single seizure since 2008. Vietnam is the only country in the world where rhino horn grinding bowls are mass produced; I went to a factory that's making 30,000 of them.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If they publicly signalled that the trade is unacceptable and gives Vietnam a bad image, that would set a whole direction of the country and lead to better law enforcement. So far we're not seeing that. Everyone at the highest level is ducking and diving.\"</p> <p>South Africa has an estimated 18,000 white rhinos and 1,195 black rhinos. The number of births still exceeds the number of deaths. But Milliken warns that if the country loses more than 500 a year, the population will start shrinking by about 2018.</p> <p>While the country's <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/south-african-province-plans-birth-control-campaign-to-curb-elephant-population/article4482017/\" title=\"\">elephant population has been on an upward curve</a>, a sharp increase in the legal export of lion bones \u2013 again for traditional medicine in the far east \u2013 has raised fears of illegal poaching of lions. A recent <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-07-12-officials-turn-a-blind-eye-to-the-smuggling-of-wild-lions\" title=\"\">report in South Africa's Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper</a> detailed smuggling routes used by criminal cartels and said a complete lion skeleton can sell for up to 80,000 rand (\u00a36,000). It quoted conservationists as saying big cats could be extinct in the wild within 10-12 years.</p> <p>Joseph Okori, African rhino manager at the WWF, said: \"Wildlife crime in Africa is on the increase. Asia's economies have been growing and people who would not be able to afford these products in the past can afford them now. The only way they obtain them is through illegal means. This has created a global market that is self-perpetuating.</p> <p>\"It's a complicated situation and it will not be solved overnight. It needs international co-operation at the highest level, not just at the African Union but at the UN.\"</p>"
