  "<p>I am all for radical rethinks of the classics. London, for instance, boasts few better evenings than the current Young Vic Three Sisters. Patrick Marber has even provided, in After Miss Julie, a provocative update of Strindberg's 1888 play. But, although it features the redoubtable Juliette Binoche , this French production, originally seen at the Avignon festival, swathes Strindberg's naturalistic tragedy in nonsensical Gallic chic.</p> <p>In many ways the real star of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fisbach's production is Laurent P Berger \u2013 a visual artist responsible for set, lighting design and costumes. He has created a rectangular white box filled with sliding panels, swirling curtains and a bevy of beautiful people who might have stepped out of a French edition of Vogue. For the first 30 minutes we see them partying enthusiastically to background music by Blondie, Buzzcocks, Joy Division and Marvin Gaye. We assume this is some Midsummer Eve wingding thrown by Mademoiselle Julie who gradually separates herself from the gang to entice her father's valet, Jean, on to the dancefloor.</p> <p>The seduction that inevitably follows spells ruin for Lady Julie (as she should properly be known) as well as for Jean and his fiancee, Kristin. But Strindberg, who knew what he was about, deliberately set the action in the kitchen, with its stove, scullery table and spice jar, so that we see the heroine descending into another world.</p> <p>But here the svelte Kristin works at a kitchen unit that would go down well on a TV cookery programme. And there is little sense of the gulf between the classes since Jean looks as nattily clad as any of the party goers. All of this makes it a little odd that the guests themselves should advance on the post-coital Julie and Jean like some dismayed Greek chorus.</p> <p>I suspect the production is trying to get beyond the idea that the play is about the lady in love with the servant to explore the psychopathology of sex but even here it has mixed results. Binoche has a striking physical presence, rails with vehement disgust at the object of her desire and prowls around the stage as if it were a cage; but she never strikes me as \"the child of nature\", with elements of male as well as female, that Strindberg envisaged. Nicolas Bouchaud also catches the arrogance and upwardly mobile aspirations of Jean but little of his ultimate enslavement to convention. The best performance, in fact, comes from Benedicte Cerutti whose Kristin reacts with justifiable rage to the idea she should become an accomplice to Julie and Jean's fantasies of escape.</p> <p>In the end, the production makes little sense. Strindberg dreamed of a \"small stage and a small auditorium\" where the entire focus would be on the situation's emotional reality. Instead the play is presented as a pictorial spectacle with the emphasis on a mood of debauched glamour and where either the glass screens or the lighting render the actors' faces semi-visible. You could say this is Fisbach and Berger's Mademoiselle Julie. On the whole, I prefer Strindberg's.</p>",

And if they're not, it will be the result of bad luck and timing. They are perfect without being too box-ticking, \"now\" without pandering to trends. Well, not too much pandering. With Amy Winehouse's engineer on board as producer, they've got the soul angle covered, only what they do is as much nu-R&amp;B as the '60s variety. Think <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/02/new-band-alunageorge\" title=\"\">AlunaGeorge</a> in Memphis, or something.</p> <p>According to their press release, Ink \"sound like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/jan/17/popandrock\" title=\"\">Lykke Li</a>, Sufjan Stevens or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/aug/23/new-band-alex-winston\" title=\"\">Alex Winston</a> \", which we can't see at all, but to be fair, each of the three songs we've heard is completely different. Mac and Massie apparently already have 25 tracks \"at various stages of completion\", and a debut album already written, so maybe they're thinking of one of their others. Of the three that we've got, one sounds like the Pretenders doing Beyonc\u00e9, one makes us think (possibly because we have overactive imaginations) of New Order jamming with a girl group, and the third isn't so much dubstep or blubstep as cutestep.</p> <p>Mac and Massie, two Londoners from Liverpool and Glasgow, only recently got together. Massie is a classically trained pianist, and Mac's uncle performed in a pub covers band, which inspired his nephew to \"play anything that came to hand\". His first recorded experiments involved a laptop and his uncle's bass; after that he worked with Dom Morley \u2013 the Grammy-winning engineer on Back to Black \u2013 at the controls. \"Dom's been brilliant,\" says Mac. \"He tidies tracks up and makes them sparkle, and adds space.\"</p> <p>Ink Goes On is about a girl who wants her lover to communicate with her, but only in ink, because \"ink lasts\". The track has a loping bassline that reminds us of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92uYWxCls08\" title=\"\">New Order circa Lonesome Tonight</a> and a melodic topline that is R&amp;B-licious. It's so catchy you can imagine it driving you mad after heavy radio rotation, but what it does do is confirm that here we have two talented tunesmiths \u2013 this, and the other two tracks we've heard, aren't just riffs or grooves, they're proper songs. Control is completely different; faster, propelled by guitar, sort of power pop, with shades of Nick Lowe's Cruel to be Kind or a Pretenders track, then changes tack totally after 30 seconds to become bouncy R&amp;B pop. The lyric-hook is memorable - \"Have you ever seen me lose control?\" - and the chorus is Chrissie Hynde meets Katy Perry. That's our one-line pitch anyway. Then it goes back to slick technoid R&amp;B pop, with a finger-clicking bassline and cool, aloof vocals. Brilliant. Our Song is an obvious next single, with enough post-Lana appeal to appease the blogerati and enough obvious charms to seduce the masses. \"They're playing our song,\" cheers Massie. They probably will be before we know it.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Ink Goes On is an alternative summer anthem that's come four months too late.

  "<p>Nemanja Vidic has called on Manchester United supporters to set an example at Anfield on Sunday by being on their best behaviour and paying respect to the 96 Liverpool supporters who lost their lives at Hillsborough 23 years ago.</p> <p>Referring to the Munich air disaster in 1958, as well as the Hillsborough tragedy, the United captain stressed \"football is never more important than any life\" and said it was time for both clubs to respect one another on what is sure to be a highly emotional occasion.</p> <p>In the first match to be played at Anfield since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-police-coverup-revealed\" title=\"\">Hillsborough Independent Panel report was published last week</a>, Vidic and Steven Gerrard, the two captains, will release 96 red balloons before kick-off as a tribute to the victims. The report cleared Liverpool fans of any wrongdoing and exposed the full scale of the police cover-up that prevented the real reasons behind the disaster from coming out before.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has empathised with the families and promised Liverpool unqualified support on Sunday, although with the rivalry between the two clubs so fierce and a minority of United supporters singing anti-Liverpool songs during last Saturday's game against Wigan Athletic, there have been fears that the enmity could resurface.</p> <p>Vidic, however, is confident that will not be the case. \"I am aware of the sensitivity of the day. Everybody is. There is a lot of talk in the papers and the media. I think our fans will respond well,\" he said. \"The whole country is on test in this one. All over the world they will be watching this game. It is probably the biggest derby in the world and we have to show we are capable of keeping a good atmosphere and being a good example to the kids.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of history with these two clubs. I think we should respect each other because we are big clubs and clubs that are respected in the world. We have to be on top of the bad situation and behave well and, I would say, be an example.</p> <p>\"I've been here for seven years and I think our fans always behave well and I think they will do it again. It is difficult to control all the fans but I think most of them are aware of the responsibility. On&#xa0;the pitch we have to take responsibility and play football. After this game everyone should be talking about the football and that's all. I hope that will be the case.\"</p> <p>Having grown up in war-torn Serbia, Vidic said that he knows the importance of keeping things in perspective. \"Football is important but it is never more important than life, any life. It doesn't matter if it's in England or Serbia or any part of the world. I think most important is that we have to respect any life and I think that we will do it on that day. We have our history and we have some tragedies as well, and we love people to respect the players [that lost their lives in Munich]. Obviously people from Man United have had tragedy and I don't think it will be different for Liverpool fans.\"</p> <p>In an unwanted sideshow to the Hillsborough tribute and the game itself, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Patrice Evra will come face to face at the ground where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/20/luis-suarez-patrice-evra-racism\" title=\"\">Liverpool striker was found guilty of racially abusing the United defender 10 months ago</a>.</p> <p>When they came up against each other at Old Trafford in February, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/12/luis-suarez-snubs-handshake\" title=\"\">Su\u00e1rez was widely criticised after he refused to shake Evra's hand</a>, although the early indications are that there will be no repeat of that snub at Anfield on Sunday.</p> <p>\"To be fair, I don't want to think about that,\" Vidic said. \"Obviously we want to focus on the game. We have a theme, what happened in history about the fans and we have to respect that day. Obviously we cannot come with any other issues, we just come there play football.</p> <p>\"If they shake hands, they shake hands \u2013 I don't think it's the most important thing in the world. I think it's important to not do any stupid things in the game, to go there and play football \u2013 what we dream of, to play that derby and to be all about the football, not about the fighting or any other things.\"</p> <p>Kenny Dalglish will return to Anfield on Sunday for the first time since being sacked as manager in a show of support for the 96 Liverpool supporters who died at Hillsborough and the families who fought for 23 years for the truth of what happened on 15 April 1989.</p> <p>Dalglish was Liverpool manager at the time of the disaster and was closely involved in the club's response afterwards, attending many funerals with his wife, Marina. The emotional toll eventually led to him stepping down as manager in 1991.</p> <p>The Anfield legend has not returned to the club since his departure in May but will be in the directors' box against Manchester United as Liverpool mark the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel with a mosaic around three sides of the stadium and recognition of the tireless work conducted by the campaign groups.</p>",
  "<p>BSkyB remains a fit and proper owner of broadcast licences, media regulator Ofcom has concluded.</p> <p>But the regulator is highly critical of the company's former chairman, James Murdoch, over his handling of the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>The judgment comes as News Corp is reportedly considering handing oversight of Fox Networks to James Murdoch. According to The Financial Times, Murdoch could soon be in charge of the media firm's flagship Fox network, one of its most lucrative assets, and cable channels such as FX and National Geographic. Fox Networks does not include News Corp's Fox News Channel.</p> <p>Ofcom criticised Murdoch, the News Corporation deputy chief operating officer and former Sky and News International chairman, for his \"lack of action\" over the News of the World phone-hacking affair.</p> <p>The regulator found that Murdoch's conduct in relation to News Group Newspapers \"repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman\" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was \"difficult to comprehend and ill-judged\".</p> <p>NGN was the News International subsidiary that published the News of the World, which was closed in July 2011 after the most damaging phone-hacking revelations emerged.</p> <p>Ofcom, which launched its \"fit and proper\" review of BSkyB's broadcast licences on 6 July 2011, the day before News International announced it was closing the News of the World, concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the pay-TV company was involved in phone hacking.</p> <p><a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/tv-ops/fit-proper/bskyb-final.pdf\" title=\"\">The ruling found</a>: \"There is no evidence that Sky was directly or indirectly involved in any of the wrongdoing either admitted or alleged to have taken place at [the News of the World] or the Sun.</p> <p>\"In the circumstances, and notwithstanding our views in relation to James Murdoch's conduct, we do not consider, having taken into account all the relevant factors, that on the evidence available to date Sky is no longer fit and proper to hold broadcast licences.</p> <p>\"Whilst we consider that James Murdoch's conduct in various instances fell short of the standard to be expected of the chief executive officer and chairman, we do not find that James Murdoch's retention as a non-executive director of Sky means that Sky is not fit and proper to hold broadcast licences.</p> <p>\"We recognise that whether it is appropriate for James Murdoch to be a director in light of the events is a matter for the board and shareholders of Sky.\"</p> <p>Sky welcomed the long-awaited ruling as its share price rose slightly in early trading on Thursday, up 5p \u2013 nearly 1% \u2013 to 733p at 9am.</p> <p>News Corp said it was pleased with Ofcom's ruling regarding Sky, but disagreed with the regulator's conclusions about Murdoch, saying they were \"not at all substantiated by evidence\".</p> <p>BSkyB said in a statement: \"Ofcom is right to conclude that Sky is a fit and proper broadcaster. As a company, we are committed to high standards of governance and we take our regulatory obligations extremely seriously. As Ofcom acknowledges, our track record of compliance in broadcasting is good.\"</p> <p>\"We are proud of our contribution as a broadcaster, the investments we make to increase choice for UK audiences and the wider benefits we create for the economy.\"</p> <p>News Corp said: \"We are pleased that Ofcom recognises BSkyB as a fit and proper holder of a broadcast licence and remain proud of both News Corporation's and James Murdoch's distinguished record in facilitating the transformation of Sky into Britain's leading pay television and home communications provider.</p> <p>\"We disagree, however, with certain of the report's statements about James Murdoch's prior actions as an executive and director, which are not at all substantiated by evidence. As Ofcom itself acknowledged, James deserves credit for his role as chief executive, then chairman and now non-executive director, in leading Sky to an outstanding record as a broadcaster, including its excellent compliance record.\"</p> <p>The Ofcom review was aimed at establishing whether the pay-TV broadcaster remained eligible to broadcast in the UK, given that News International owner News Corp is its largest shareholder, with a 39.1% stake.</p> <p>At the point Ofcom launched its review, on 6 July 2011, News Corp was still bidding to take full control of Sky. It abandoned the bid the following week in the face of mounting public and political outrage over News of the World phone hacking.</p> <p>After reviewing evidence subsequently submitted to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee and the Leveson inquiry, Ofcom concluded that Murdoch had no knowledge of an alleged News International cover-up of what has been branded the \"industrial scale\" of phone hacking at the News of the World.</p> <p>\"The evidence available to date does not provide a reasonable basis to find that James Murdoch knew of widespread wrongdoing or criminality at [the News of the World] or that, by allowing litigation to be settled and by allowing NGN and News International executives to make the representations they did, he was complicit in a cover-up,\" the regulator said.</p> <p>However, Ofcom was critical of Murdoch's reaction to the payout to Professional Footballers Association chief executive Gordon Taylor in 2008.</p> <p>The regulator said it was clear at that point in 2008 that Murdoch was aware of the existence of new evidence that News of the World phone hacking may have gone beyond one rogue reporter \u2013 as News International was claiming at the time \u2013 in light of internal documents in relation to the Taylor settlement. But he did not follow up by asking to see the opinion of the senior counsel hired by the company or finding out for himself what the evidence on which the settlement was based was.</p> <p>\"James Murdoch's exercise of responsibility was less than we would expect to see exhibited by a competent chief executive officer,\" the regulator concluded of this episode.</p> <p>Ofcom also criticised Murdoch for not taking seriously a Guardian article in July 2009 headlined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/08/murdoch-papers-phone-hacking\" title=\"\">\"Murdoch papers paid \u00a31m to gag phone hacking victims\"</a>, which first revealed the Taylor settlement and that the practice went beyond a single rogue reporter at the News of the World.</p> <p>The regulator noted from Murdoch's own evidence to the culture select committee that he entrusted the handling of the response to the Guardian article to News International subordinates, rather than launch an investigation into whether phone hacking involved the three individuals referred to in internal communications. This information subsequently emerged during a culture select committee inquiry.</p> <p>\"We consider that James Murdoch's failure to apprise himself of this information, given the information which he accepts he knew, fell short of the exercise of responsibility to be expected of the chief executive officer and the chairman,\" Ofcom said.</p> <p>Murdoch was also criticised for failing to respond meaningfully to a highly critical report by the culture select committee on phone hacking in 2010.</p> <p>\"We consider this lack of action by the chairman of News International in response to a widely publicised highly critical select committee report to be both difficult to comprehend and ill-judged,\" Ofcom said.</p> <p>It also expresses bafflement over Murdoch's inaction when the phone-hacking scandal began to escalate with the publication of fresh evidence in the New York Times in September 2010 and with the launch of legal action by Sienna Miller, which became public in December 2010.</p> <p>Ofcom noted that Murdoch gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry earlier this year that he immediately moved to get his house in order with three specific courses of action: an internal investigation; action against any employees involved in wrongdoing; and seeking fresh legal advice to get to the bottom of what was really going on.</p> <p>\"Having reviewed the relevant evidence relating to this period as a whole, we note that only one of these steps was taken in 2010,\" Ofcom concluded.</p> <p>\"In light of the events which occurred in 2009 and 2010, in particular the publication of the [culture select committee] report, the growing civil litigation and the New York Times article, we find it difficult to comprehend James Murdoch's lack of action, given his responsibility as chairman.\"</p> <p>His father Rupert Murdoch, News Corp's chairman and chief executive, escapes censure by Ofcom. The regulator said it did not find the evidence provided a basis to conclude Rupert Murdoch had acted in a way that was inappropriate in relation to phone hacking, concealment or corruption by employees.</p> <p>Ofcom also found that BSkyB was not involved. \"To date there is no evidence that Sky was directly or indirectly involved in any of the wrongdoing either admitted or alleged to have taken place at the News of the World.\"</p> <p>News Corp said: \"We are also pleased that Ofcom determined that the evidence related to phone hacking, concealment and corruption does not provide any basis to conclude that News Corporation and Rupert Murdoch acted in a way that was inappropriate, and that there is similarly no evidence that James Murdoch deliberately engaged in any wrongdoing.\"</p> <p>If the regulator had decided that either James Murdoch \u2013 who stood down as chairman of News International in March 2012 and as chairman of BSkyB in April, but remains on the board of the broadcaster as a non-executive director \u2013 or the company itself were not fit and proper owners, the regulator could have revoked its licences.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>New Mexico governor Susana Martinez has asked her administration to remove a reference to \"forcible rape\" from a new state policy, after its use was criticised by women's groups.</p> <p>The outdated and inaccurate language, which effectively narrows the definition of rape, became the subject of heated debate in August after Republican Missouri senate nominee Todd Akin used the term \"legitimate rape\" in describing his anti-abortion views.<br><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/new-mexico-forcible-rape-child-care-policy_n_1898617.html?utm_hp_ref=politics\"><br>The Huffington Post reported on Wednesday</a> that the term appeared in the New Mexico's proposed changes to its official applications to childcare assistance. The state's children, youth and families department was proposing changes to its means-testing policy for childcare assistance that would exempt only victims of \"forcible rape\" and incest from having to file child support claims against the father.</p> <p>Women's and family groups reacted angrily, saying that using such language made a distinction between \"forcible\" and other rapes, even though all rapes involve force. It would also, critics said, push victims of rapes not considered \"forcible\" \u2013 such as statutory rape of a minor \u2013 to contact their rapists to pursue them for child support before being eligible for childcare assistance.</p> <p>No-one at the state's CYFD was available for comment.</p> <p>Enrique Knell, a spokesperson for the CYFD, told the Huffington Post that Martinez, a Republican, asked the department to remove the word \"forcible\" from the language on Wednesday night.</p> <p>\"It's redundant, unnecessary, and she [Martinez] doesn't support its usage,\" Knell said.</p> <p>He said the CYFD had used such language because the FBI still uses the definition, as do some federal regulations relating to paternity disputes.</p> <p>Martinez, a former district attorney, <a href=\"http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/09/19/new-mexico-governor-susan-martinez-seeks-proof-forcible-rape-in-applications-chil\">also used the words \"forcible rape\" in a proclamation about New Mexico's Sexual awareness month in April</a>.</p> <p>Carol Tracy, the executive director of Woman's Law Project, which has long campaigned for the definition of \"forcible rape\" to be changed, welcomed Martinez's removal of the term.</p> <p>She said: \"It is a good move, a progressive move. Because rape is force enough.\"</p> <p>The definition of rape used by the FBI in its Uniform Crime Report was revised from \"forcible rape\" to rape in January this year. Rape is now defined federally as: \"The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\"</p> <p>However, states vary in their definition of rape.</p> <p>Attorney general Eric Holder, announcing the changes earlier this year, said: \"The longstanding, narrow definition of forcible rape, first established in 1927, is 'the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will.' It thus included only forcible male penile penetration of a female vagina and excluded oral and anal penetration; rape of males; penetration of the vagina and anus with an object or body part other than the penis; rape of females by females; and non-forcible rape.\"</p> <p>\u2022 We originally referred to Susana Martinez as a former attorney general. We should have said district attorney. This has now been changed.</p>",
  "<p>Declaring that the practice had \"gone too far,\" the New York Times on Thursday banned reporters from agreeing to give sources quote approval before publication.</p> <p>\"Starting now, we want to draw a clear line on this,\" reads <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/in-new-policy-the-times-forbids-after-the-fact-quote-approval/\">an internal memo quoted by the Times' current public editor</a>, Margaret Sullivan, who had <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/the-times-needs-a-policy-on-quotation-approval-and-soon/http://\">called for such guidelines</a> in a column just days earlier. \"Citing Times policy, reporters should say no if a source demands, as a condition of an interview, that quotes be submitted afterward to the source or a press aide to review, approve or edit.\"</p> <p>The change comes after weeks of public debate over quote approval, which has become routine for reporters covering the presidential campaign. Top advisers to both President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney typically demand quote approval as a condition to granting interviews.</p> <p>Given the intensity of competition for interviews with top campaign figures, and the value of those conversations in gaining insight into the presidential race, reporters are under pressure to go along with demands for quotation review. </p> <p>Colorful language, out-of-order opinion and impolitic digression all are stripped in the process. Copy suffers; campaigns already rendered dull by modern message discipline and the ubiquity of recording devices show even less vitality in print. </p> <p>The Times appears to have put in place a more strict proscription against quote approval than news organizations such as Reuters and Politico, which discourage but do not ban the practice.</p> <p>The Times memo says that \"demands for after-the-fact quote approval by sources and their press aides have gone too far\".</p> <p>\"The practice risks giving readers a mistaken impression that we are ceding too much control over a story to our sources,\" it says. \"In its most extreme form, it invites meddling by press aides and others that goes far beyond the traditional negotiations between reporter and source over the terms of an interview.\"</p> <p>Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for George Bush, <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/189170/the-new-york-times-bans-quote-approval/ \">traces the practice to Bush's second term</a>, Poynter noted.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has described lack of immigration reform as the biggest failure of his presidency, but blamed his inability to legalise millions of undocumented immigrants on what he implicitly admitted was another failure \u2013 the collapse of his attempts at compromise and consensus with Congress and the realisation that he \"cannot change Washington from the inside\".</p> <p>Obama was repeatedly pressed on immigration by a mostly Latino audience in an interview on the Spanish-language Univision TV station in Miami. He was forced to defend his record on deportations of illegal immigrants and to deny that his order in July allowing about 1.7 million young undocumented migrants to obtain work permits was an election ploy.</p> <p>Obama was also accused of breaking a promise, made during the 2008 presidential election campaign, to permit a path to citizenship or residency for many undocumented immigrants during his first year in office.</p> <p>Asked later in the interview what the greatest failure of his presidency has been, Obama returned to the topic.</p> <p>\"My biggest failure so far is [that] we haven't gotten comprehensive immigration reform done,\" the president said. \"But it's not for lack of trying or desire \u2013 and I'm confident that we're going to accomplish that.\"</p> <p>Obama denied he had broken his promise and went on to blame his inability \"to change the tone in Washington\" for the lack of an immigration reform law. He said that as soon as he came to power, Republicans conspired to block him.</p> <p>Obama said he could not find a single Republican to work with him on immigration legislation. He said he had been \"naive\".</p> <p>\"The most important lesson I've learned is that you can't change Washington from the inside; you can only change it from the outside. That's how I got elected and that's how the big accomplishments like healthcare got done, was because we mobilised the American people to speak out,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Something I'd really like to concentrate on in my second term is being in a much more constant conversation with the American people so that they can put pressure on Congress to help move some of these issues forward.\"</p> <p>Opinion polls show Latino voters to be twice as likely to vote for Obama as Romney, but many votes are up for grabs in some battleground states such as Florida.</p> <p>The Republicans, keen to go on the offensive after a torrid two weeks, immediately pounced on the remarks, with Mitt Romney repeatedly mentioning them during a speech in Sarasota. Claiming that the president had broken a promise made in 2008, Romney said: \"His slogan was: 'Yes we can'. Now it's: 'No I can't'.\"</p> <p>On Twitter, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, wrote: \"Between no immigration reform and can't change DC from the inside, seems like Obama just admitted his 08 campaign was garbage.\"</p> <p>The Univision audience questioned Obama on issues that rarely get much of an airing in the US English-language media, such as combating Mexico's drug cartels.</p> <p>But the primary focus was on immigration, a source of considerable concern in Hispanic communities where families often have relatives or friends who are in the US illegally.</p> <p>Obama was pressed on why there has been a rise in deportations of illegal immigrants under his presidency. He said that it was in part because Congress put more money into enforcing border controls. Nonetheless, he said the target of deportation is not \"hard-working families\" and those with long ties to the US.</p> <p>\"More than half of our enforcement now is directed at people with criminal records. Of the remaining half, about two-thirds are people who are typically apprehended close to the border. So these are not people who have long standing roots,\" he said.</p> <p>But he added: \"We still ultimately have to change the laws.\"</p> <p>Although Obama faced strong scepticism at times, he appeared to emerge in better shape than his Republican rival, after Romney a similar appearance on Wednesday on Univision, a principal source of news for a large number of Latino voters.</p> <p>Romney was accused of evading questions about whether he would deport undocumented aliens, including the young people Obama ordered should be permitted to stay. Eventually an exasperated Romney said: \"We're not going to round up 12 million people, that includes kids and parents, and have them all deported.\"</p> <p>Romney said that as president he would find a \"permanent solution\" to an immigration system that has \"been broken for years\". This included temporary work permits and permanent residency cards to people with advanced qualifications. </p> <p>But he repeatedly refused to say whether he would overturn Obama's order permitting young illegal immigrants without a criminal record to remain in the US and obtain a work permit.</p> <p>\"These kids deserve something better than temporary \u2013 they deserve a permanent position,\" Romney said without offering a specific alternative.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Romney said he favoured policies to promote \"self-deportation\" of illegal immigrants, but he downplayed that on Wednesday.</p> <p>Rommey's attempt to woo Hispanic voters was further damaged on Thursday with the emergence of a clip from a video of a Romney fundraiser in which he said that illegal immigrants generally \"have no skill or experience\".</p> <p>\"Gosh, I'd love to bring in more legal immigrants that have skill and knowledge. I'd like to staple a green card to every PhD in the world and say, 'Come to America, we want you here.' Instead, we make it hard for people who get educated here or elsewhere to make this their home,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Unless, of course, you have no skill or experience, in which case you're welcome to cross the border and stay here for the rest of your life. It's very strange.\"</p> <p>Obama took the opportunity to take a jab at Romney over other parts of the fundraiser video which has been leaked in recent days - particularly Romney's assertion that the half of American voters who support Obama pay no income tax, rely on the government for handouts and think of themselves as victims.</p> <p>Obama said Romney is out of touch.</p> <p>\"When you express an attitude that half the country considers itself victims, that somehow they want to be dependent on government, my thinking is maybe you haven't gotten around a lot,'\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Gary Tarn is a British director creating collages of images and ideas, in the tradition of Chris Marker \u2013 directing, shooting, editing, and composing the music. After his Bafta-nominated Black Sun, he has returned with a visual quilt inspired by the prose-poem The Prophet, a spiritual-humanist work by Kahlil Gibran. He assembles intriguing and potent images, strikingly juxtaposed, a free-form cinematic rhapsody, which is accompanied by an adapted voice-over of the original text. This may also have absorbed something from Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life. I am an agnostic about Gibran \u2013 for me, his work verges on Hallmark-card-speak \u2013 and it took a while to acclimatise to Thandie Newton's narration, in a sonorous American accent. But Tarn is persuasive, and you can't help but respond to the boldness, intelligence and creativity of hisfilm-making.</p>",
  "<p>It might sound like one of Richard Desmond's magazines, but \"fit and proper\" is a test that would not ordinarily have any connection with the scandal-strewn end of Fleet Street. It exists as a means of allowing the meticulously technocratic regulator, Ofcom, to pull the plug on a broadcaster which is breaching basic proprieties. Fifteen months ago it would have been unthinkable for it to be applied to a respectable outfit such as BSkyB, and yet such have been the travails of the Murdoch family, who control a large minority stake, that Europe's biggest pay-TV provider spent the early part of the summer waiting to hear whether it would be allowed to carry on at all.</p> <p>A couple of months ago BSkyB received <a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/tv-ops/fit-proper/bskyb-final.pdf?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the report,</a> which was eventually <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/sky-fit-and-proper-ofcom-james-murdoch\" title=\"\">published </a>on Thursday, and with it the predictable news that it would not be shut down. What was more striking about Ofcom's decision was how far short it fell of declaring a clean bill of health. The test, as the ruling underlined, is an \"ongoing duty\", giving scope to react to any information that comes to light in the multiple, ongoing prosecutions and police inquiries sparked by the scandal that engulfed the Murdoch empire after the Guardian revealed that the News of the World had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/04/milly-dowler-voicemail-hacked-news-of-world\" title=\"\">hacked into the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler</a>.</p> <p>The caveat about what happens next is matched by another about what came before the report was finished. When Ofcom's probe was launched, in July 2011, NewsCorp was still bidding to raise its stake in a broadcaster, which James Murdoch chaired, from 39% to 100%. Days afterwards that bid was withdrawn, and then \u2013 in April this year \u2013 Mr Murdoch gave up his commanding position for a non-executive directorship. Ofcom was clear both that the size of an owner's shareholding is material, and indeed that the concern about any board member undermining the operation's overall fitness will be shaped by their exact role \u2013 and lessened to the extent that they \"may be moderated\" by their peers. Given the scorn the regulator poured on the former chairman, it seems fair to ask whether the overall conclusion about BSkyB would have been different if \u2013 instead of stepping away \u2013 Mr Murdoch had been consolidating his command.</p> <p>Ofcom did not mince its words in damning a hereditary magnate who \"repeatedly fell short of the conduct expected of him as a chief executive officer\". It did not find conclusive evidence that he had engaged in deliberate wrongdoing, but nor did it exonerate him. Indeed, by detailing his inaction and seeming incuriosity after the first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/08/murdoch-papers-phone-hacking\" title=\"\">2009 Guardian report</a> about a \u00a31m payout to silence hacking victims, and then again after Sienna Miller's litigation began, the regulator strengthened a conclusion that was already becoming hard to resist \u2013 that Murdoch junior is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/10/editorial-james-murdoch-phone-hacking\" title=\"\">either a knave or a fool</a>. Whichever it is, the damning language in this decision will <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9554862/Ofcoms-BSkyB-ruling-does-lasting-damage-to-James-Murdoch.html\" title=\"\">scar his reputation</a> for a time to come, and is there to be quoted by his enemies in the event that he should attempt a march back to the top of NewsCorp, where he remains deputy chief operating officer, or a corporate reincarnation elsewhere.</p> <p>The implications for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/05/news-corp-executives-bonuses-cut\" title=\"\">royally remunerated</a> former heir apparent of the media world's octogenarian colossus may be chilling for the family, but for the broadcaster which they helped to build there is the glimmer of an opportunity here. When NewsCorp's bid for 100% of BSkyB was withdrawn in the crisis month of July 2011, it seemed possible that this was a mere tactical retreat from a strategy that would be reasserted in due course. That looks less plausible 14 months later, and especially after Thursday's report. Since Mr Murdoch <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17599269\" title=\"\">quit the chair in April</a> it has become pertinent to ask what a future for BSkyB without the Murdochs might look like. Thursday will only encourage that question. With its phenomenal sports rights, a solid news operation and improving arts coverage, the broadcaster could surely thrive in a world where it was freed from any connection to NewsCorp and British newsprint \u2013 a world, in sum, where it was accepted that Sky was the limit.</p> <p><em>\u2022 For legal reasons, this article will not be opened to comments</em></p>",
  "<p>It is not the crystal blue waters of the Caribbean that attract the Conservative party treasurer Lord Fink to the Cayman Islands, the British overseas territory nestled between Jamaica and Cuba.</p> <p>He believes UK investment firms such as ISAM, where he is a director, are drawn to the tiny territory for one overriding reason: the island's authority taxes wealthy foreign investors at much lower rates than in Britain.</p> <p>In a frank interview, Fink has called on the government to compete with the island and other offshore havens by easing the tax burden on wealthy foreigners who invest in hedge funds.</p> <p>\"Offshore companies are used for technical reasons, not tax avoidance [by the company],\" he said. \"Many of the structures in the [hedge fund] business have to be based offshore anyway. Otherwise why would a Japanese person investing in a hedge fund want to pay UK tax? All of the industries I am involved in have to have some offshore entities, if only to help those investors.\"</p> <p>Fink said he tried to persuade George Osborne three and a half years ago that he should change UK tax rules \u2013 under which gains investors make on hedge funds are taxed to income rather than capital \u2013 so the British mainland could compete with offshore jurisdictions.</p> <p>\"I lobbied George Osborne when the Tories were in opposition. I have long felt that the British government loses jobs to tax havens by allowing the revenue to have these rather archaic rules,\" he said. At the time he lobbied Osborne, Fink was not a treasurer but had given more than \u00a31m to the party.</p> <p>As shadow chancellor Osborne resisted his arguments, he said, probably because of influence from Revenue and Customs. \"It's a case where the Revenue has been penny wise and pound foolish. I have never understood it but it is something that the Revenue has always been paranoid about.\"</p> <p>His words may well embarrass the chancellor as he strives to present the Tories as a party that no longer cuts taxes for the rich or is lobbied by its big donors.</p> <p>They come amid an intense national debate over tax and whether there is a moral obligation upon British individuals and businesses not to use offshore havens.</p> <p>Fink \u2013 who has been described as the godfather of the UK hedge fund industry and has now given more than \u00a32.6m to the Tories \u2013 holds directorships at three companies which have links to tax havens. ISAM Services (UK) Limited has a parent company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. A spokesperson for ISAM said this allows a number of international investors to invest in that company without being subject to a double tax charge from the UK and their own domicile.</p> <p>He is also a member of Earth Capital Partners LLP, an investment partnership which owns subsidiary asset management firms in Guernsey.</p> <p>In 2010, Fink was appointed director of Marex Group, which has subsidiaries in Gibraltar and Switzerland.</p> <p>He insists there is little choice for those involved in international investment \u2013 you must have an entity based somewhere such as the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>\"If you want to be a successful business and attract invisible earnings to the UK, you have to be based offshore.\"</p> <p>The widespread connections between peers \u2013 who cannot vote on tax laws but can participate in debate and lobby in Westminster \u2013 and companies established in offshore havens, whether for tax, administrative or operational purposes, seem to confirm Fink's claims that the practice is not seen as tainted by executives in large international corporations.</p> <p>One of the wealthiest people in the music industry, Lord Lloyd-Webber, also sits in the House of Lords as a Conservative peer. He is a director of Really Useful Group, which owns a firm called Ruby Limited, a company registered in the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>A spokesman for Lloyd-Webber said there were no tax benefits from the subsidiary, adding that it is now dormant. He added that Really Useful Group plans to dissolve the company.</p> <p>Lord Howard, the Conservative party leader before Cameron, is a non-executive director of Global Switch Limited, which has offshore subsidiaries in the Isle of Man, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands. Howard insists the company pays \"all the taxes we are obliged to pay\".</p> <p>\"Global Switch Ltd does not carry out activities in its non-UK subsidiaries and all of the revenues associated with Global Switch Ltd are taxed entirely in accordance with UK legislation.\" Howard added: \"I have no involvement in those [offshore] subsidiaries and as far as I am aware they are all dormant.\"</p> <p>Lord Chadlington, the Tory lobbyist, donor and David Cameron's constituency chairman, is also chief executive of Huntsworth, the public relations group. The company has subsidiaries in Switzerland, Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>A company spokesman said it has 210 subsidiaries, of which eight are in the identified jurisdictions.</p> <p>\"Huntsworth's UK tax bill has not been any lower because of the existence of these companies, which were for the most part acquired to allow Huntsworth to expand its business overseas. To suggest that Huntsworth has links with tax havens is clearly misleading in light of this explanation.\"</p> <p>Senior Labour MPs have expressed dismay that Labour peers are linked to companies established in tax havens. Lord Carter of Coles, the former chairman of Sport England, has a directorship at the Bermuda-registered Primary Group Ltd, a private-equity investment company. He did not respond to calls or emails.</p> <p>Lord Robertson, the former defence secretary and Nato secretary general, is a non-executive director of the Glasgow-based engineering firm Weir Group, which has subsidiaries in the Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>He is also deputy chairman of the board of the Russian oil company TNK-BP, registered in the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>Robertson said that Weir's offshore subsidiaries are \"not used\". \"In the annual report you will see that Weir Group pays more in tax than British taxation demands. TNK-BP was registered before my time but it pays tax in full in the Russian Federation.\"</p> <p>Other elder statesmen with offshore links include Lord Razzall, a former Lib Dem trade and industry spokesman, who sits on the board of directors at a firm called Ardel Holdings. The company is based in Guernsey and offers services including tax mitigation for clients, promising that \"income can be rolled up tax free\".</p> <p>Ardel helps with tax mitigation through \"fiduciary structuring\" for businesses and individuals. It also helps non-domiciled UK residents exploit non-taxable offshore funds. Its website says: \"The benefits and flexibility delivered by offshore companies make them a highly attractive option for clients.\"</p> <p>Razzall said: \"As an adviser to the owner of Ardel Holdings for the last 25 years I have always been satisfied that the business does not engage in activities of the type criticised by George Osborne.\"</p>",
  "<p>Watch Harlequins train and you get some idea of why they are back on top of the pile going into Saturday's rerun of last season's grand final against Leicester. They are not alone in this but their training usually ends with a session that does away with the natural pauses that are built into a game of rugby and goes flat out.</p> <p>There is no chance of getting a breather by walking to scrums and lineouts because there aren't any. There isn't even time for a blow after scoring a try because the ball is immediately back in play \u2013 run from behind the try line. Stop concentrating, stop running and you're in a mess because everyone else is going at 100mph.</p> <p>Mind you, when they play you can see why Harlequins drive themselves. To play the way they do, there can be no concessions when it comes to fitness. It's like paying money into a bank; if you put it in, there will always be something there when you need it most.</p> <p>Someone once said that, if you train like a club player, then you'll stay a club player. However, train like an international and you stand a chance of becoming one. That became much truer when recent interpretations of the law of the game speeded up things immeasurably.</p> <p>It started with the banning of kicks directly into touch from outside the 22-metre line. Initially that led to a backward step and those tedious aerial bombardments but once referees insisted that the man with the ball had to be released in the tackle, then defenders lost their fear of being caught in possession and played, even from deep in their own territory.</p> <p>The ball stayed in play longer and longer so players had to get fitter and fitter to cope. Now it's reckoned that in Test matches a back will run up to 10km and a forward \u2013 even the very biggest of the big boys \u2013 will do between 6-7k while \u2013 and you can see where Harlequins are coming from here \u2013 there are fewer scrums and lineouts, which means fewer ambles to the set pieces.</p> <p>Different sides found different ways of coping but weights have tended to make way for fitness based more on running. There will always be weight training, especially for the lighter and younger players, but in some respects training has gone full circle with echoes of how players got fit 30 or 40 years ago.</p> <p>It was said then that the All Blacks got their strength from walking around the countryside with a rescued sheep slung across their shoulders. Well, now there are very few farmers in the New Zealand team, just as there are no coalmen or miners in the Wales squad, but fitness coaches have devised routines to mimic those work routines. Now we carry bags of bricks or sand instead of a sheep, pull tyres in sprint sessions, Sumo wrestle or wrestle with huge tractor tyres.</p> <p>I've always maintained that the best training for rugby is anything that leaves you bent double, near to retching and with your lungs on fire \u2013 the \"no pain, no gain\" lobby if you like.</p> <p>But does it work? You bet it does. A couple of weeks into the last World Cup and there were quite a few players in the Wales squad who were almost impossible to tire. You could run them off their feet but after 40 seconds recovery time they were ready to go again no matter what had gone before.</p> <p>It was the result of having the squad together for three months and we could see a marked drop-off in fitness during the Six Nations. Wales still did the grand slam but we estimated that fitness levels had fallen by 10 to 15%.</p> <p>We put that down to the heavy programme in Welsh rugby over the Christmas period, normally the season for local derbies. Too many games made the players match fit but left no time for the kind of quality training that would get them near those peak levels.</p> <p>However, from the evidence of last season, when Harlequins stayed true to their all-court game with only that one slight wobble in the semi-finals against Northampton, it would seem to be a trap they learned to avoid. It certainly gave them the confidence to play the game their way and it will be fascinating to watch them at Welford Road on Saturday and see how things have moved on.</p>",
  "<p>Did <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/jesus-wife-ancient-script-harvard?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Jesus marry Mary Magdalene</a> and have children? Was Richard III a regicide or a good king? Did Neanderthals reoccupy Spain 40,000 years ago? Who was King Arthur? Does history know? Does it matter?</p> <p>The discovery of a papyrus fragment suggesting Jesus had a wife is certainly a good story. So was the recent \"discovery\", or rediscovery, of a \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2128195/Jesus-discovery-Does-1st-Century-coffin-lid-Jerusalem-reveal-Jesus-resting-place.html\" title=\"\">Jesus family tomb</a>\" by robot cameras beneath a Jerusalem tower block, complete with Mary Magdalene and children. This reportedly stunned archaeologists, who looked on in \"ecstatic disbelief\". It should perhaps have stunned them that, if Jesus did have a wife, no one should have noticed for 2,000 years. But it can only be a matter of time before someone unearths \"Jesus DNA\" somewhere between Golgotha and the Holy Sepulchre. All hell will break loose.</p> <p>The evidence for Jesus's wife comes with the imprimatur of Harvard University's Karen King. Her Coptic document, a century after the event, reports of the disciples that \"Jesus said to them, 'my wife' \u2026 \" He added, presumably of Mary Magdalene, that \"she can be my disciple\". The US is now seething with biblical scholars, emerging from obscurity like No&#xa0;11 buses in a pack. According to one from Tennessee, the fragment \"proves nothing \u2026 thin air\". A Canadian remarks that there are always \"thousands of scraps of papyrus where you find crazy things\". A Kentuckian points out that \"wife\" in Coptic can mean \"a female believer who cooks and&#xa0;cleans and does domestic chores\" but has nothing to do with sex. This may tell us more about Copts (and Kentuckians) than about Jesus.</p> <p>No sooner is Mary Magdalene back in the box of legend than up pops <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/14/tory-mp-state-funeral-richard?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Richard III in a Leicester car park</a>. No monarch has had his reputation so vilified by some and uplifted by others. He is the earliest English king to emerge with some personality. But the unearthing of a possible skeleton in a car park, presumably tossed in with decapitated traffic wardens, has reopened the oldest can of medieval worms.</p> <p>My friend Ben Macintyre in the Times hails the Leicester find as the apotheosis of a king \"maligned by gossip, political manipulation, Victorian sentimentality and literary licence\". He trusts that a DNA test will not only grant Richard a monarch's burial but clear him of murdering the two royal princes in the Tower of London in 1483.</p> <p>I cannot see how. Any reputable historian may list good things that Richard did, both for his brother, Edward IV, and during his own brief reign. Nor is there a specific smoking gun (or dripping dagger) for the deaths, variously, of Henry VI, Clarence, Hastings, Richard's wife Anne and the princes in the Tower (one of them Edward V). Ricardian online apologists explain that such butchery is anyway par for the course for a monarch during the wars of the roses. To them, Richard is a cross between Alfred the Great and the Good Samaritan.</p> <p>I see Richard not as an incompetent king \u2013 though he spectacularly failed in the holding of his crown \u2013 but as a peculiarly ruthless and cruel one. He appears to have been present at the killing of Henry VI. He unquestionably usurped the throne, and secured the disappearance of Edward V and his brother. The two boys were last seen in the Tower in the summer of 1483, and suddenly were no more. It does not matter if DNA proves the juvenile bones exhumed and buried at Westminster belong to them. Medieval monarchs did not have to wield the knife to will their rivals dead.</p> <p>Partisan history tends to be the realm of nerds. It seduces students into over-confident conclusions, to prop up preconceptions of \"goodies and baddies\". Positions once adopted become impervious to reason or research. Radiocarbon dating revolutionised archaeology in the 1960s but was dismissed out of hand by many older generation scholars. Today's DNA techniques threaten many of the assumptions of pre-history.</p> <p>So, too, with the papyrus. It is significant that the Vatican censored all mention of the Jesus-wife theory, even of its sceptical reception. It is presumably afraid not of the fragment's truth or&#xa0;falsity, but of anyone putting the topic to the court of reason. Likewise each new theory of mankind's evolution and migration, as of the survival of Neanderthals deep into the human era. Either we stay studiously humble before the evidence or we capitulate to religious mumbo-jumbo.</p> <p>This summer I found myself in Tintagel, self-proclaimed \"birthplace of King Arthur\". This is utter nonsense. Even Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his 12th-century fantasy \"history of the kings of Britain\", never claimed Arthur was born or lived at Tintagel (he merely had him conceived there as a result of rape). The site is rather a monument to the potency of myth over history, of fiction over truth.</p> <p>I gazed over that spectacular headland on the Cornish coast and wondered at the long centuries of knights, round tables, chivalric traditions, holy grails, Tennyson, Hollywood, trinket shops and junk laughing all the way to the bank. History was left weeping in the gutter.</p> <p>Researching the past is not just a quest after forgotten people, objects and events. It is supposedly a ceremony of reason, a rebuttal of ancestral myth, a way of looking at the past with the same rigour that we ought to apply to the present. Politics without history is likely to lie. To surrender a dispassionate search after truth to the cause of fantasy, however enjoyable or profitable, is to court superstition and fanaticism.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Good evening all. Paul will be here soon enough and ready to type you all the way through tonight's games. If you get here before him, here's a few words from Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas on why Spurs are taking the Europa League seriously. Enjoy.</p> <blockquote> <p>Tottenham Hotspur may have been shunted into the Europa League by Chelsea's Champions League triumph last season but their manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, has no intention of taking the continent's secondary tournament lightly. The Portuguese has vowed to \"embrace the Europa League as if it were the Champions League\" and that ambition will be reflected in the strong side he will deploy as Spurs begin their campaign at home to Lazio on Thursday night.</p> <p>Villas-Boas's predecessor, Harry Redknapp, made a token attempt to win this tournament last season, scattering fringe players throughout his line-ups as he chose to preserve most of his primary resources for the Premier League; Spurs' elimination in last season's group stage almost seemed a relief to then-manager.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/andre-villas-boas-tottenham-europa-league\">Continued here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Hugo Lloris is starting</strong>: what are we to kick up a disingenuous panic about now?</p> <p><strong>Teams:</strong><br><strong>Spurs:</strong> Lloris, Walker, Caulker, Vertonghen, Naughton, Sandro, Dembele, Lennon, Dempsey, Bale, Defoe. <br><strong>Subs: </strong>Cudicini, Huddlestone, Gallas, Dawson, Sigurdsson, Townsend, Mason.</p> <p><strong>Lazio:</strong> Marchetti, Lulic, Dias, Biava, Cavanda, Ledesma, Onazi, Gonzalez, Hernanes, Mauri, Klose. <br><strong>Subs: </strong>Bizzarri, Ciani, Scaloni, Ederson, Zarate, Kozak, Floccari.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Ovidiu Alin Hategan (Romania)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Hats off to Andre Villas-Boas</strong> for sending out a strong side for tonight's game and let's hope he continues to do so, instead of emulating Martin O'Neill or Tony Pulis, who wasted everyone's time by taking the tournament seriously right up until the latter stages when they surrendered. At least the likes of Harry Redknapp and Gary Megson didn't even pretend to give a fig (and they got their comeuppances too). The attitudes of some English clubs' to the Uefa Cup/Europa League stinks as badly as that of the stuck-up FA gents who saw no value in fraternising with Johnny Foreigner in the early days of the World Cup and international competition.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to work they go. With Aaron Lennon as captain, Tottenham win the toss and take kick-off.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is up to his tricks already, slinkily dropping his shoulder and gliding past two Lazio players before an attempt to slide the ball through to Defoe is foiled.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Ah. There's the down side of fielding strong team in this tournament: Sandro has just copped a fearful clatter from Ledesma and crumpled to the grass. Worried looks soon dissipate, however, when the Brazilian clambers back to his feet. Gingerly, of course. Is football the only walk of life in which the adverb gingerly is regularly used?</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> It's been good stuff from Spurs so far. They've dominated possession and occasionally threatened to unhinge Lazio. Sandro sent Lennon scampering down the right with a clever pass. Leenon stuck it into a dangerous area but, with only Defore among three defenders, Lazio dealt with it comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Danger! A sloppy header by Walker invited Ledesma to seize possession and he did just that, then centered for Klose, whose header was saved by Lloris.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Defoe receives the ball 25 yards from goal and surprises everyone by .... shooting. His effort had neither the power nor accuracy to bother Marchetti.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Bale adopts the Roanldo stance for a 30-yard freekick ... and produces Roberto Carlos-esque results. Straight into the wall.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> A lull. Lazio have slowed the game down and wrestled back a good share of possession.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Gah! Lovely Spurs play is ruined by a terrible decision at the climax. Defoe and Lennon sliced the Lazio defence apart with a sharp one-two but then Lennon - 12 yards from goal and only the keeper to beat - decided to chip the ball to the marked Bale to his right! No good came of that.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> \"Quite a bit (too much) has been made of the situation with Lloris and whatever his actual feelings about it (as opposed to those of Didier Deschamps) he's really only got himself to blame. Seeing as Villas-Boas was after him from before the season started if he hadn't stalled over the transfer he would probably have been first choice for Spurs's opening fixtures and not given Brad Friedel the chance to cement his place with some fine displays. Maybe Lloris should think hard when he comes to the end of his current contract with his agent about whether he's earning his 15%.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Spurs denied! Bale cut in from the right and then clipped a dainty cross to the far side, whereupon Dempsey dived to head splendidly into the net! But it's chalked off for offside, a hair on Dempsey's left knee having strayed into forbidden territory.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Spurs have another freekick nearly 30 yards from goal. Bale, Vertonghen and Walker put forward their cases for taking and Bale wins: and t hen does exactly what he did last time, adopting the Ronaldo stance before banging the ball into the wall. Vertonghen next time please! \"Quite a bit (too much) has been made of the situation with Lloris and whatever his actual feelings about it (as opposed to those of Didier Deschamps) he's really only got himself to blame,\" spews David Wall. \"Seeing as Villas-Boas was after him from before the season started if he hadn't stalled over the transfer he would probably have been first choice for Spurs's opening fixtures and not given Brad Friedel the chance to cement his place with some fine displays. Maybe Lloris should think hard when he comes to the end of his current contract with his agent about whether he's earning his 15%.\" I think it's significant that AVB has waited until a European match to give Lloris his debut (overlooking him for all of ... one game prior to that): the one slight weakness in Lloris' game is on crosses and I reckon Spurs want to give him some quality time working on them with Tony Parkes before chucking him into the hurly-burly of the Premier League.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Lennon's speed is tormenting Lazio on both flanks. If he regularly made the right decision after racing into great positions, he'd be a world-beater, rather than a head-scratcher. Still, Biava couldn't deal with him just, so cynically chopped him down at the left-hand corner of the box. This time Dempsey steps up to take the freekick .... and into the wall it goes.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> A smart intervention from Vetonghen stops Klose from teeing up Mauri for a very presentable chance after a Lazio break.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> It's a tight game. But Bale manages to create space for himself down the left and then hoiks in a decent cross. Well, it would have been a decent cross if, say, Adebayor or Dempsey was awaiting. But the nearest player was Defoe, several yards below.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Since this game has sunk into a minor rut over the last few minutes, how about an update from the other match in this group? Robert Beric has given Maribor a 1-0 lead over Panathinaikos. So there.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> That's more like it! Vertonghen tried a clearing header but it fell to Gonzalez at the edge of the area and he volleyed it firs time over Lloris and ... into the crossbar!</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Onazi tries his luck from 30 yards. Wide.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> The ref blows for half-time 13 seconds early. I know how he's feeling.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Question:</strong> What's the most unexpected insult that's ever been directed at you? I only ask because my colleague, the top wordsmith Tom Bryant (@TomBry), was telling me during one of the many lulls in the first half about the time that the Iron Maiden front-man Bruce Dickinson berated him for being \"a liar and a scumbag ... with bad grammar\". It was all a dreadful misunderstanding of course, and Dickinson no longer wants to bring the reporter to the slaughter, but for a while there Tom was sadder than Cristiano Ronaldo.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Lazio set the second half in motion. If you want, you can amuse yourself by saying that to the tune of a famous Smokey Robinson and Al Cleveland number. In other news, Ryan Dunne was once on the end of an unexpected insult. At least he thought he was. \"A doctor once told me, after I fell off a big hill, that I survived due to having 'an abnormally thick skull'. Although this surely constitutes a superpower, I interpreted it as regrettable medical validation for an insult that teachers and girls have long hurled my way.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Lloris comes to successfully claim a cross. That'll do him good.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> A beautiful pass by Hernanes to Klose opens up the Spurs defence, but the German then mislays an attempted pass to Mauri. Spurs go down the other end nearly score: first Lennon tumbled after Defoe nipped the ball through to him - the ref ignored strong appeals for a penalty and Dempsey tried to scramble the breaking ball into the net, but Lazio defenders crowded him out.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Lulic nuts a Tottenham corner clear. As an aside, I must tell you that Naughton has had a solid enough game at left-back ... but I still believe that Assou-Ekotto's injury is the perfect chance to deploy Bale at left-back and Sigurdsson ahead of him (Pienaar would have been perfect if he ere still at the club). That would give Bale more space in which to get up a gallop and have the additional merit of enabling them to field yet another attacking midfielder.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Dempsey slips a fine ball through to Bale, who is sudenly one-on-one with the keeper ... until the ref correctly pulls him back for offside. \"Any idea what Hernanes's temperament is like?\" wonders David Wall. \"Just thinking that he be a headline-writers dream (assuming the pronunciation in commentary is right) if he were to lose his rag and earn a red card, described in the morning papers, 'Hernanes goes bananas'.\" I don't know what his temperament is like. But I do know he sleeps from time to time. Yes, \"Hernanes wears pyjamas\".</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Dias booked for dragging down Bale as the Welshman threatened to burst through the middle.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Gonzalez is lucky to escape a booking as he scythes down Lennon, conceding a freekick at the right-hand corner of the Lazio box. Bale will take it ...</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Bale's delivery was good, so was Sandro's run ... but his header was diabolical, as he glances it wide from six yards.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Another Bale freekick from the right causes problems, but Dias hooks the ball away just as Caulker seemed set to pounce from close range. The Tottenham threat is mounting though ...</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Another Tottenham goal is disallowed. Caulker met Bale's in-swinging corner with a towering header that bounced into the net from six yards but the ref rules that he got illegal leverage off Mauri. That seemed pernickety to me: both players were jostling each other and Caulker was simply stronger.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> A buffoonish dive by Gonzales actually fools the ref, who awards the defender a freekick and gives Lazio a chance to stem the rising Spurs pressure.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Bale has been down injured for over a minute now, beating the ground in apparent pain. Cavanda fell on him after he put in a cross ... and as soon as the ref stops play, Bale's recovery begins. \"I was at an 'exclusive' event where the band Sugar was performing songs from their latest release and the main attraction was the bands' front man Bob Mould (formerly of Husker Du fame),\" discloses Andrew Coote. \"After walking around talking to people, listening to the band perform, picking up swag, etc. I was approached by an attractive woman who said to me 'Are you anybody?' I looked up, smiled and said 'nope I'm nobody.' She was genuinely upset and walked away in disgust.\" Was she anybody?</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Spurs substitution: Dempsey off following a decent performance, Sigurdsson on.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 beats four players in midfield and bears down on the box. But Lazio are defending with great number and diligence and they prevent the Belgian from slipping a pass through to Lennon.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> As Lloris clasps another corner, Lazio make a change: Zarate on, Onazi off.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Spurs substitution: Lennon off, handing the armband to Defoe as he goes, and Townsend on.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Lazio hvave been all about clinging on for a draw for about 25 minutes now. Mauri becomes the fourth player to get a booking for deliberately nipping Tottenham move in the bud.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Walker clips in a freekick from the right. Bale gets a head to it but Lazio block it and then scramble it away, with even Klose helping out. \"Of all Spurs's transfer business the move I found the oddest was the deadline day purchase of Dempsey,\" dribbles David Wall. \"Don't get me wrong, he's an excellent player but he seems very similar to Sigurdsson who they already had at that point. Was it just an exercise in annoying Liverpool, or more tactical to buy up players so that your competitors can't have them like Milan did during the 90s?\" I don't think it was that complicated, David: like you said, he's an excellent player he was real cheap. Easy decision to make.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Naughton lofts a long cross to the back post. Townsend rushes in unmarked. The angle is too acute to shoot but cutting it back could prove profitable ... so he shoots. Wide.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> That was tight, and almost something that rhymes with that. The ref played a negative part too, twice ruling out goals that could have been allowed to stand. Lazio threatened in the first half but early in the second decided that they'd happily take a point from this and defended well enough to subdue Tottenham for long periods.</p>",

  "<p>There's a phrase, midway through Mumford &amp; Sons' second album, that neatly encapsulates their existence. \"Watch the world tear us apart,\" Marcus Mumford sing-speaks in his tarry voice, \"a stoic mind and a bleeding heart.\" They are the epitome of a Marmite band: vilified for their privileged background and narrow vision of folk music; celebrated for their spit'n'sawdust energy and biblical&#xa0;framing of love.

  "<p>Up to 100,000 people are facing the prospect of severe delays during the Christmas getaway, as Network Rail embarks on a huge engineering project on the west coast mainline on 23 December.</p> <p>For the two days leading up to Christmas there will be no direct services between London and some of the country's biggest cities \u2013 Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool or Glasgow. As well as causing misery for passengers, the plans will be an unwelcome gift to FirstGroup, which is due to take over the running of the line from Richard Branson's Virgin Group just two weeks earlier.</p> <p>Traditionally the line's busiest time of the year, with 100,000 travelling on 24 December alone, every passenger heading to Milton Keynes and beyond from London Euston will compete to board a slow, hourly service to Nuneaton to wait for onward trains \u2013 a station with no shops or cash machine and only a single place to buy food.</p> <p>There will be long delays with Network Rail forecasting at least 45 minutes to one hour and 20 minutes extra on journey times while they carry out work at Bletchley junction. Although the upgrade of the west coast line was officially completed at the end of 2008 at a cost of \u00a39bn, rail insiders say the scaled-back programme of works failed to address old signalling and cables that now require substantial work four years on.</p> <p>The line closes completely over Christmas with limited direct services resuming on 27 December as engineering work continues up until the new year. Full services only resume in January.</p> <p>A Network Rail spokesman said the investment would mean more capacity, increased reliability and faster speeds on the tracks around Milton Keynes, benefiting all the passengers who travel on the west coast line. He added: \"We understand the impact this work will have on passengers and have worked hard to keep the most disruptive parts of this \u00a3125m project to an absolute minimum.\"</p> <p>The disruption will occur a fortnight after FirstGroup is due to take over the running of the line from Virgin, although the current legal dispute makes that date look difficult to achieve.</p> <p>Virgin's franchise expires on 9 December, and Branson has offered to continue running the trains on a non-profit basis while the legal issue is resolved.</p> <p>The Department for Transport issued papers to the high court acknowledging the lawsuit brought by Virgin before the contract for FirstGroup to run the franchise until 2026 could be signed. Virgin alleges that the franchising process did not adequately safeguard against perceived risk in the winning bid. The DfT has requested a hearing as soon as possible, as a judge is yet to be appointed and the DfT will have to submit evidence before any court date \u2013 meaning the legal tussle will likely drag on into autumn, preventing a timely signoff of the handover to FirstGroup.</p> <p>The DfT is still hoping that FirstGroup will be able to take over in December but are making contingency plans for Directly Operated Railways (Dor), the state company currently running the east coast main line, to step in.</p> <p>The 3,200 staff currently working for Virgin Trains will be transferred to a new company under employment protection legislation, but the RMT union has warned that this process is too complex to happen in a short space of time. The handover will also require physical changes including repainting trains and issuing new staff uniforms, to financial and ticketing handovers and the signing of hundreds of new contracts with suppliers.</p> <p>The union is now in parallel discussions with both FirstGroup and Dor. A spokesman said the DfT was taking a \"cavalier and totally inappropriate approach\", adding: \"We want the line taken over by Dor as a matter of urgency and for the long term \u2013 there's no point in going through this charade again in the next few months.\"</p> <p>Tickets bought in advance by passengers from Virgin or other suppliers will remain valid whoever is running the service in December.</p>",
  "<p>What should we make of the latest moves to kickstart the US economy, and to save the euro? As the late, great <a href=\"http://www.towleroad.com/2011/03/longtime-harvard-chaplain-peter-gomes-dies-at-68.html\" title=\"\">Harvard</a> chaplain Peter Gomes said to my graduating class many years ago, about our degrees: \"There is less there&#xa0;than meets the eye.\"</p> <p>Quantitative easing, the third tranche of which was announced in the US last week (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/federal-reserve-qe3-quantitative-easing\" title=\"\">QE3</a>), is just a fancy phrase for buying bonds, notably mortgage-backed-securities, in which operation the Federal Reserve takes assets from the banks and gives them cash. This raises the bond price and lowers the yield. It also tends to boost stock prices \u2013 very nice for people who own stock \u2013 and it can spur mortgage refinancing, improving the cashflow of solvent homeowners.</p> <p>And the effect on the economy of all this is? Mostly indirect and quite small. People don't generally spend <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gain\" title=\"\">capital gains</a> as windfalls. Saving on mortgage debt helps to support spending but some of it goes to paying down other debts. People who are already underwater on their mortgages can't refinance anyway, and are not affected. Yes, there is some effect. But powerful stimulus, this is not.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is buying the dregs of the European bond market, propping up their price. The operation is similar to QE but the help for the economy is even less. Mario Draghi, the bank chief, aims to save the euro, not the eurozone; his conditions actually prevent beneficiaries from using the money they save; in fact, to get the aid they must spend less. So long as this goes on, unemployment, budget deficits and debt will get worse. It's no surprise that sensible countries refuse the deal for as long as they can.</p> <p>Some people in high places \u2013 Tim Geithner, the US treasury secretary, for example \u2013 profess that restarting bank lending is the key to economic recovery, and increasing bank reserves will spur them to lend. (What else are banks really good for?) But if anyone believes that reserves are key to lending, they deeply misunderstand what banks do.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.levyinstitute.org/about/minsky/\" title=\"\">Hyman Minsky</a> used to say: banks are not moneylenders! Banks don't lend reserves, and they don't need reserves in order to lend. Banks create money by lending. They need a client willing to borrow, a project worth lending to, and collateral to protect against risk. If these are lacking, no amount of reserves will turn the trick. And especially not when the government is willing to pay interest on their reserves: the truest form of welfare, income for doing nothing.</p> <p>In a debt-deflation, actually there's even worse news. When asset prices are falling, how do banks make money? Not by fighting the trend but by riding it. If they withhold loans, prices will fall even further, and the assets can be bought later for even less. You might call this shorting the entire economic system. You can't blame the banks for this, it's how money makes money in hard times. But to expect them to act as the agents of economic growth in such conditions is foolish.</p> <p>Among the deluded in this matter are Republican members of Congress who rushed to attack QE3 for overstimulating, and urge laws constraining the Federal Reserve to a single <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/intro/benefits/html/index.en.html\" title=\"\">price stability objective, in the manner of the European Central Bank</a>. Obviously if the policy won't work \u2013 and it won't \u2013 they have nothing to fear on inflation. But the move toward a \"price stability only\" mandate for the Fed would have an effect that you might think legislators would disfavour: it would destroy the honest accountability of the central bank to Congress.</p> <p>The Fed today operates under what is called a \"dual mandate\" \u2013 full employment and price stability. The law, originally known as the <a href=\"http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/Humphrey-Hawkins-Act.html\" title=\"\">Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978</a>, is one for which I drafted the monetary sections, as the responsible staff member of the House Banking Committee, around 1976. It actually states a range of economic objectives and was deliberately kept general; the purpose was not to dictate economic theory but to foster an honest dialogue between the Fed and Congress over what monetary policy is and does. This framework for accountability has been remarkably durable \u2013 the hearings we started have held up as the basic method of monetary policy oversight for 34 years.</p> <p>Changing to a price-stability objective would oblige Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, to claim, as ECB officials do, that he is motivated solely by his charter, even if obviously doing something else. And Congress, having imposed the price-stability straitjacket, would not be able to complain about unemployment, foreclosures or anything else. The Fed-Congress dialogue would be reduced to a tissue of ritual incantation and lies.</p> <p>What we need instead, today, is a candid review of what central banks cannot do. Yes, they can usually forestall panic. Yes, for better or worse they can keep zombie banks alive. No, they cannot bring on economic recovery or solve any of our deeper economic problems, from unemployment and foreclosures in America to unemployment and economic collapse in Greece and elsewhere. The sooner we stop thinking of central bankers as wizards and magicians, the better.</p>",
  "<p>We write to say how pleased we are that the government has expanded the definition of domestic violence to include \"coercive control\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/19/teenage-victims-domestic-violence-definition?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 19 September). This means domestic violence is no longer simply viewed as individual acts of behaviour, but defined as a pattern of ongoing power and control, by one individual over another. This can include intimidation and threats to carry out violence or abuse. We are also pleased the work will reach out to teenagers and young women and men.</p> <p>This is particularly appropriate in view of the fact that the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/\" title=\"\">UN commission on the status of women</a> will be focusing on violence against women and girls at its meeting in March 2013 and we know the UK government wishes to ensure it has a successful outcome. Many women's organisations (about 35) have come together in the UK in a network to prepare for the commission and to work with the government before, during and after the meeting. This grouping (UK NGO CSW57 Liaison Group) seeks to prevent a repeat of this year's meeting when no agreed conclusions could be reached. This was the result of the push-back by some governments and a range of powerful fundamentalist NGOs (different faiths) against women's hard-won reproductive health rights and services. Such arguments especially threaten steps that need to be taken when the safety of women and girls is at stake.<br><strong>Annette Lawson </strong><a href=\"http://www.nawo.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>National Alliance of Women's Organisations</em></a>,<strong> Zarin Hainsworth</strong><br><em>Co-chairs, UK NGO CSW57 Liaison Group</em></p> <p>\u2022 In his excellent analysis of the case of Sarah Catt, imprisoned for aborting her baby at 39 weeks, Simon Jenkins (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/judicial-machismo-sarah-catt-britain-medieval?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 19 September) highlights the harm done to society by needlessly sending women to prison. If society truly understood concepts of risk and public protection, it would not put over 12,000 women in prison each year, where they face far greater risk to themselves than they ever posed to society. The public are not safer and the impact on the women in custody and their children is catastrophic.</p> <p>Prison is not a deterrent and it struggles to be a place of rehabilitation, as the reoffending rates show. Its sole purpose is punishment, with an impact on the offender which far outweighs the crime. We are sending the most marginalised and damaged women to prison, where they demonstrate the hurt and pain they permanently suffer by cutting and hurting themselves; 47% of self-harm incidents in prison, a shocking total of 12,663 in 2010, are inflicted by women, despite being just 5% of the prison population. That so many women return to society in a worse state than before they were imprisoned is not surprising. What is surprising is our failure to inform ourselves on the issues around this and to hold the judiciary and government to account. No woman should be sent to today's costly prisons. Smaller custodial units would work better; community alternatives are cheaper, cause less disruption to troubled women's lives and have a more positive outcome for society.<br><strong>Mary Pimm</strong><br><em>Trustee, Women in Prison</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins says 80% of women prisoners are jailed for nonviolent offences and that this is expensive for the state and destroys families. While I agree, I am disappointed at the regularity with which these comment pieces appear when a woman is sent to prison in a high-profile case. Seventy-two per cent of men are sent to prison for nonviolent offences. Don't their families deserve the same consideration as the families of female offenders? The need to reform the approach to crime and offenders is self-evident. It is not helped by continually focusing upon women and excluding the very real needs of male offenders.<br><strong>Dennis Lane</strong><br><em>Pretoria, South Africa</em></p>",
  "<p>I have experienced some remarkable audience reactions in my time. Yelps of fear. Shouts of laughter. Cheering. But I&#xa0; heard something unprecedented in this incredibly tiresome and unendurably long film by Oliver Stone, featuring deathly performances from actors who have had a pint of formaldehyde injected into their necks. The audience gave a growl of incredulous group rage when one scene was revealed to be some sort of fantasy or dream sequence and we were now expected to sit through basically the same fatuous nonsense again \u2013 perhaps because the director had shot two versions and just had to include both in this fantastically bloated and flatulent movie.</p> <p>Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, the stars, show that they are not just pretty faces. No, they are also incredibly bad actors. They play Chon and Ben, two supercool drug dealers who have made a fortune plying top-quality dope in the Laguna Beach area of California. Ben is a brainy and decent guy who totally wants to supply poor people in the developing world with clean water facilities. Chon is a muscly ex-soldier, whose military buddies show up at opportune moments to provide firepower. Things turn nasty when a Mexican drug cartel moves in on their turf and kidnaps their shared girlfriend O (Blake Lively), for whom they are the Jules et Jim of drugs. O is short for Ophelia, incidentally, a literary allusion that turns out to have zero significance. These Mexicans are led by the imperious Elena, played by Salma Hayek, and her brutish enforcer, played by Benicio Del Toro, both playing up to broad stereotypes. And there's a crooked DEA cop, played by John Travolta.</p> <p>Of the latter players, it's hard to decide who gives the worst performance. Hayek is like Johnny Depp giving a drag-queen impersonation of Winona Ryder doing a homage to Luis Guzm\u00e1n. Travolta is phoning it in from a part of the world that doesn't have telephones, and Del Toro, charmlessly grunting his way through the lines, deserves a special Oscar for<a href=\"http://cinema.theiapolis.com/movie-2TDK/savages/gallery/benicio-del-toro-as-lado-in-savages-2012-1084240.html\" title=\"\"> most unattractive moustache</a>.</p> <p>Sadly, Savages plays up to Stone's worst tendencies: machismo, bombast and self-indulgence, and the factor that could conceivably have made this movie tolerable \u2013 humour \u2013 is off the menu. The icy wit of Pulp Fiction is nowhere, and neither is the docu-realist fervour of Steven Soderbergh's Traffic. At two hours and 11 minutes, the picture has ballooned beyond control and there is no dramatic point or weight to any of it. There is savagery in being as boring as this.</p>",

Almost all the parties of the church are represented and there is even Dr Barry Morgan, a Welshman, to represent the rest of the world for the first time in this process. They will pick two names to present to the prime minister, who is bound to choose the first, unless he proves unable to take the job.</p> <p>The man they choose will have at least five jobs at once in his new post, and very little power in any of them. He is a bishop in Kent. He sits in the House of Lords. He chairs meetings of the bishops of all England. In some very nebulous sense he is also the leader of the Anglican communion, a worldwide body with no agreed doctrine and no discipline, which has rejected all attempts to supply it with either. If the Queen dies, he will crown her successor. When the nation requires religious pageantry, he must supply it and star in it.</p> <p>\"The next man has got to be able to hold together the Anglican communion, and to stare down the loony left and the loony right on sexual questions,\" says Stephen Kuhrt, a south London vicar who represents centrist evangelical opinion. \"There are those who want a split as soon as possible, but the vast majority of Anglicans want a working compromise on sexuality. We need someone who can communicate a bit more on a popular level than Rowan, and is a bit tougher.\"</p> <p>This time last year the two main candidates were John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, and Richard Chartres, the bishop of London. Neither filled the church with much enthusiasm. Sentamu wanted the job too obviously. Chartres has refused to ordain women. Both men are in their 60s, and Sentamu is not in perfect health. This matters because if one of the jobs of the archbishop is to run the Anglican communion \u2013 well, to head it, since it is not a body coherent enough to run \u2013 he must be in shape for the next Lambeth Conference in 2018, when most of the Anglican bishops of the world will come together.</p> <p>During the Occupy crisis last year, Charters originally wanted the protestors cleared away, but after Giles Fraser resigned the bishop reversed position with blinding speed and conviction. Chartres is hugely experienced, having served as Robert Runcie's chaplain, and he can point to the fact that church attendance in his diocese has grown over the last decade.</p> <p>Sentamu's qualifications are drive, intelligence and a gift for theatre. As a black African former asylum seeker he is able to praise British patriotism extravagantly. He seems at home as a columnist for the Sun on Sunday, where he writes things such as: \"We shouldn't be shy about saying how great our country is.\" He inspires devotion in his staff but two people separately said to me he will never get the job because he sat on the appointments committee for five years, and some of his former colleagues there are determined that he should not. He has drifted out in the betting.</p> <p>\"John Sentamu is a great public face for Christianity in this country, but not a great manager of people,\" says Kuhrt. \"Of course, in this job you do have to challenge the Captain Mainwarings if you want anything to happen.\"</p> <p>Beyond them, candidates are less obvious. Among the younger bishops the bookies early anointed Christopher Cocksworth, bishop of Coventry, as favourite. He is an evangelical, ran a theological college, and he hasn't offended any powerful lobbies. But reports from his diocese suggest that he hasn't offended anyone only because he can't take decisions. Sentiment has quietly but decisively swung away from him.</p> <p>James Jones, the bishop of Liverpool, who has just chaired the Hillsborough inquiry, is another possible caretaker choice. Although he has a firm evangelical background, he is sympathetic to gay clergy and an enthusiastic green. He had heart surgery last year, and though a fluent speaker, he lacks the star quality possessed in their different ways by both Sentamu and Chartres.</p> <p>Graham James, the bishop of Norwich, is favourite everywhere of the steady-as-she-goes party. He is widely experienced \u2013 he worked in Lambeth Palace under the previous archbishop, Lord Carey \u2013 and widely trusted, as well as scholarly. But critics say he has the charisma of a tea cosy and exemplifies the benevolent but out-of-touch quality of a church cut off from the mainstream of English life.</p> <p>Outsiders include Nick Baines, the newly appointed bishop of Bradford. He is active on Twitter, where journalists notice him, and he is both interested in the media and largely unafraid of it. He is an evangelical, which ticks one important box, but youth (he's 51) and inexperience should tell against him.</p> <p>Another possible is John Inge, bishop of Worcester, a former public schoolmaster favoured by some centrist evangelicals. He is the author of an unlikely work of theology, Living Love, which takes as its starting point the detective novels of Alexander McCall Smith.</p> <p>Liberals make wistful noises about Stephen Cottrell, the bishop of Chelmsford. He was the man with briefly the worst job in the church \u2013 brought in as the unimpeachably heterosexual bishop of Reading after Williams lost his nerve in the face of a concerted and international evangelical campaign and forced his old friend Jeffrey John, a celibate gay man, to withdraw from the post. That was in many ways the defining catastrophe of Williams's term in office, and his surrender ensured that bitter infighting over gay clergy would continue for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>\"Stephen Cottrell has got nous, native wit, and common sense. It is an impossible job, but we are ready for someone to say, when a crisis comes along, like the banking crisis, 'Look, this is bad' and to do so in a joined up, cogent, and clear way,\" says Rachel Boulding, deputy editor of the Church Times.</p> <p>But Cottrell also has limited experience and is too friendly to gay clergy and gay rights to be acceptable to most evangelical opinion.</p> <p>This leaves the dark horse, whom no one was discussing a year ago, yet now seems to lead the field: Justin Welby, the bishop of Durham. The reason why Welby was never discussed earlier is also the big strike against him. He wasn't even a bishop this time last year, but dean of Liverpool. He was only consecrated as bishop in the new year. This also means that he has made no enemies yet.</p> <p>Welby is an evangelical; he's also an old Etonian. But people who might be repelled by either or both of these traits tend not to be in practice. He charmed Giles Fraser, for example. He is thoughtful about the Church of England's problems. If these were primarily financial, he would be the outstanding candidate. Not only did he have a successful career as an oil trader before seeking ordination, he turned around the finances of Liverpool Cathedral when he ran it.</p> <p>None of the candidates will bring comfort to a Tory government. The most establishment candidates are Chartres and Welby. But Chartres is a Prince Charles-type Tory who wants less capitalism and more hierarchy. Welby has been an informed critic of the banks. Sentamu was stopped and searched eight times by the Metropolitan police while he was bishop of Stepney, and served on the Macpherson committee that accused the force of institutionalised racism.</p> <p>Whoever he is, the next archbishop will face other large problems, even though the issue of female bishops will probably not be among them. It looks as if a form of words has been agreed which both supporters and opponents can accept, so that the first will be consecrated next year.</p> <p>The struggle over gay clergy will continue for the foreseeable future. Opinion within congregations is slowly shifting as it has shifted in the outside world. But the long stalemate, punctuated by vicious little skirmishes, can only be expected to continue.</p> <p>There is the slow international fissioning of the Anglican communion, where conservative Africans and Asians have been trying for years to throw out the more liberal churches of North America, with the Church of England caught uneasily between factions. It's difficult to see any compromise there except the peace of exhaustion.</p> <p>With all these difficulties at home and abroad it's lucky that the Crown Nominations Commission believe in prayer, since prayer will work at least as well as horsetrading when it meets next week to choose its victim.</p>",
  "<p>Police have charged a 29-year-old man with the murders of two police officers, as well as a father and son \u2013 and the attempted murder of four other people.</p> <p>Dale Cregan will appear before magistrates on Friday.</p> <p>Earlier, police had called on two feuding crime families in east Manchester to end the dispute that allegedly led to the two police officers being shot in Tameside.</p> <p>Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, died while responding to a report of a burglary at Abbey Gardens, on the Hattersley estate in Mottram, on Tuesday morning. A grenade was also allegedly used in the attack. A postmortem examination revealed both died of gunshot wounds.</p> <p>On Thursday evening, Cregan, 29, was charged with four murders: those of Hughes and Bone, and of Mark Short, 23, killed on 25 May, and his father, David, 46, killed on 10 August. Additionally, he is charged with attempted murder involving four others who were injured during the alleged murder of Mark Short at the Cotton Tree pub.</p> <p>Nazir Afzal, the chief prosecutor for the CPS in the north west, confirmed the charges. Assistant chief constable Garry Shewan had said earlier in the day that it would be wrong to portray Manchester as being in the middle of a gang war. \"This would overestimate what we have got here: clearly two feuding criminal families,\" he said.</p> <p>He went on to declare that \"enough is enough\", and that Tuesday was a watershed moment that had to be the end. Over the past decade, gun crime has fallen in Manchester year on year. The force has witnessed the largest reduction in gun crime anywhere in the UK.</p> <p>Shewan also said a 22-year-old man in Netherley, Merseyside, had been arrested under the Communications Act 2003 after an offensive Facebook page was set up after the officers' deaths. Merseyside police later said the man had been released on bail.</p> <p>The arrest was thought to be linked to a Facebook page that appeared to praise Dale Cregan and also suggested he be awarded an OBE.</p> <p>The Greater Manchester chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, visited the scene where the officers were killed. He stood in silence alongside colleagues, heads bowed, among the bouquets left in tribute. He described them as \"two wonderful human beings, two very dedicated officers\".</p> <p>He said earlier he had spoken to both their families and recounted some of the kindness they had shown to victims of crime. And he said the families were grateful for the \"massive show of public support\". Fahy said: \"The two families are just overwhelmed by the huge support they are getting right across the country.\"</p> <p>Shewan said: \"In the last 48 hours, since the tragic death of our two officers, there has been a huge amount of support from the public through our website and on social media.</p> <p>\"However, there are also a small number of people who have posted malicious and upsetting comments online, causing outrage to many people and prompting them to ask us what we are doing to deal with these people.\"</p> <p>He said police took reports of this nature very seriously, as demonstrated by the arrest.</p> <p>An online book of condolence has attracted many thousands of messages from wellwishers and a Facebook page set up by the force has been viewed by more than a million people.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, a member of the public set up a Facebook page offering cover so Greater Manchester police officers could attend the funerals of Bone and Hughes.</p> <p>Shewan said he could not thank the public of Greater Manchester and the UK enough for their support and good wishes since Tuesday. It was, he added, the worst day in his policing career, and the force was still coming to terms with \"the loss of two wonderful, first-class young officers\".</p> <p>He said it would do everything it could to rid Greater Manchester of organised crime.</p> <p>An unnamed source claimed in the Manchester Evening News that if you knew the right people, you could pick up grenades for as little as \u00a350.</p> <p>But the force dismissed claims that the gun used in the shootings had been supplied by Steven Greenoe, an American who was jailed in the US for importing gun components to the UK.</p> <p>Greenoe, of Raleigh, North Carolina, bought guns in the US, broke them up and hid them in his luggage before travelling to the north-west of England on commercial flights.</p> <p>On Wednesday, a 28-year-old man, Stephen Garvey, who lives on the estate was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.</p>",
  "<p>Latinos living without immigration papers in Arizona have begun bombarbing helplines and lawyers' offices with anxious requests about how to provide for their children should they be arrested under a controversial new police power that came into effect this week.</p> <p><a href=\"http://respect-respeto.org/\">A phone line</a> hosted by the Arizona branch of the <a href=\"http://acluaz.org\">American Civil Liberties Union</a> has received almost 4,000 calls in just two days, many from anxious parents who fear that their children could be left abandoned should they be picked up under the so-called 'show-me-your-papers' provision. Hundreds have been asking for help setting up a \"power of attorney\", which gives a relative or friend who has US citizenship the right to care for minors in such an eventuality.</p> <p>\"People are terrified. They fear that they will go to the store to buy groceries and won't get home and their kids will be left alone at school,\" said Luz Santiago, a pastor in Mesa. She said she has personally handled about 50 requests for power of attorney since Tuesday.</p> <p>The show-me-your-papers clause is the most deeply contested of the provisions of SB 1070, an Arizona law that was passed in 2010 that has set the benchmark for a wave of hardline immigration laws clamping down on undocumented families that have swept across several states. Under its terms, police officers are required to investigate the immigration status of anyone they come across during normal police work and whom they suspect of being unauthorised.</p> <p>The law was snarled up in legal challenges that went up to the US supreme court. In June, the court struck down several elements of the legislation but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/ world/2012/jun/25/arizona-immigration-ruling-joy-disappointment\">allowed 'show me your papers' to go ahead pending local Arizona court approval</a>.</p> <p>That approval was granted this week and the provision is now in effect.</p> <p>Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, is already braced for the new power having witnessed the impact of heavy-handed policing for years under the direction of the Joe Arpaio, America's toughest sheriff. Groups working with undocumented Hispanics are more concerned about other smaller towns such as Flagstaff and Prescott, which have large Latino populations but no experience of police officers acting as immigration agents.</p> <p>Tucson, Arizona's second-largest city, is calling a forum next Tuesday in which community leaders will meet the police chief Roberto Villasenor to discuss implementation of the clause. Regina Romero, who sits on the city council and who has convened the meeting, said the clear fear was that police would be drawn into racial profiling.</p> <p>\"We live 45 minutes from the Mexican border, so who else other than Mexicans are you going to be picking up? You are not going to be looking for Canadians in this part of the country,\" she said.</p> <p>Alessandra Soler, head of the ACLU in Arizona, said that there was already evidence that Tucson police were making contact inappropriately with US border patrol officers even for such mundane issues as help with translation. \"It's extremely problematic when you have local police contacting border patrol when there is no good reason.\"</p> <p>The ACLU and other groups have an outstanding civil rights action against SB 1070 still lodged with the state's appeal court. That legal attempt to put a stop to 'show me your papers' will continue to pass through the courts, and the intention of opponents of the provision is to beef it up with real examples of racial profiling that might now occur under it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://respect-respeto.org/\">Lydia Guzman, the director of the hotline</a>, said the aim now was to chronicle the impact of the new law. \"The supreme court has given us the green light to present to the courts victims of racial profiling, so that's our challenge: show me the victims.\"</p>",
  "<p>The approach of Brendan Rodgers to the Europa League \u2013 namely, senior players have the night off \u2013 may have encouraged the belief that it is nothing but a sideshow to Liverpool this season. His response to victory over Young Boys of Berne provided the riposte.</p> <p>Rodgers punched the air as Jonjo Shelvey's late goals brought order and Liverpool superiority to a chaotic night in Switzerland. With no Premier League wins to his name as Liverpool manager, he had taken a degree of risk in leaving so many established players behind to prepare for Sunday's emotive home game with Manchester United. It paid off handsomely, five away goals for the first time in this competition since the 2001 final victory over Alav\u00e9s resulted in Rodgers embracing his players and looking ahead to United with renewed vigour.</p> <p>Comedy own-goals and dreadful defending always increase the entertainment value and the Stade de Suisse was treated to both as Liverpool's group campaign opened in slapstick fashion. There was also, thankfully for Rodgers, rich encouragement in several individual displays, valuable experience for the debutants Andre Wisdom and Suso and flashes of quality from Nuri Sahin, albeit against mediocre opposition.</p> <p>Liverpool's inexperienced and youthful side could not have imagined a finer start than that provided by Young Boys with only three minutes and 24 seconds on the clock. Stewart Downing struggled to find a red shirt all evening and his early right-wing cross was no exception. With no Liverpool striker near him, however, the midfielder Christoph Spycher headed a clearance straight into the face of his team-mate Juhani Ojala and looked on aghast as the ball rebounded back over his own line. Laughter from the press box was not well received by home supporters in the row in front.</p> <p>Young Boys almost responded immediately but the stand-in Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones saved well from Ra\u00fal Bobadilla's angled drive. They had a half-hearted penalty appeal waved away when Alexander Farnerud fell too easily under pressure from Jamie Carragher and went close through Gonzalo Z\u00e1rate's curler from the edge of the area. But their best hope of a recovery was Jos\u00e9 Enrique, Liverpool's hapless defender.</p> <p>Sahin and Jordan Henderson, supported by the industrious Suso, controlled midfield in the first half and Young Boys were unsettled by the manner of the opening goal but Liverpool's performance was undermined by their left-back all night. Enrique endured a poor second half to last season under Kenny Dalglish and, after an inauspicious beginning with Rodgers, this was opportunity to aid his recovery from a recent knee injury. It was a damaging process at times.</p> <p>Enrique had already been beaten too easily by Z\u00e1rate on the left, conceding a free-kick that Farnerud squandered, when he intercepted Bobadilla's burst into the penalty area. The Spanish left-back succeeded in beating the Young Boys striker to the ball but ran into his goalkeeper and then sent a woeful clearance across his own area to Raphael Nuzzolo. Despite Jones's best efforts, Young Boys were level.</p> <p>In contrast to the experienced Enrique Wisdom enjoyed a strong, disciplined debut on the right of the Liverpool defence. The 19-year-old from Leeds has appeared on the verge of a breakthrough at Anfield for a few years and will have savoured the moment when it finally arrived. Less than two minutes after Nuzzolo's equaliser the defender soared above the Swiss defence to head Sahin's corner low beyond Marco Wolfli.</p> <p>It would be remiss to claim the quality improved after the interval but, with the defending from both sides deteriorating from an already low starting point, the spectacle certainly did. Ojala brought Young Boys level for a second time when he headed into the correct goal after Bobadilla's cross fell between Sebasti\u00e1n Coates and Wisdom. They then took the lead when Bobadilla provided once again, this time holding off Carragher and Suso and putting the perfect pass through to Z\u00e1rate to finish with an exquisite chip over the advancing Liverpool keeper.</p> <p>Coates brought the visitors level quickly with a header from Downing's corner although Fabio Borini, on as a substitute, attempted to claim the goal for a faint touch on the line. There was no disputing the impact of another substitute, Jonjo Shelvey, as Rodgers reverted to 4-4-2 and Liverpool regained the midfield control that had escaped them after the interval.</p> <p>The England Under-21 international restored Liverpool's advantage after Borini and Henderson combined to set him up from close range. With two minutes remaining, Shelvey assumed the responsibility that is often left to Steven Gerrard among Liverpool midfielders as he drove at the Swiss defence, evaded one challenge and beat Wolfli convincingly. It was a moment of quality at odds with a chaotic night. Not that it concerned Rodgers.</p>",
  "<p>It still sounds like nothing you've ever heard, however many times you listen to it: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGY9tHHM63Q\" title=\"\">Glenn Gould's first recording of&#xa0;Bach's Goldberg Variations</a>, made in 1955, has an energy, an intensity and a sheer joy that is as irresistible today as it was when astonished record-buyers first heard it nearly 60 years ago. It's no surprise that this record launched the myth of Gould as much as it signalled the start of his career, but no one could have predicted the effect this young Canadian pianist would have on music. Lauded the world over \u2013 his tour to Russia in 1957 is still remembered fondly by Vladimir Ashkenazy and by everyone else who packed out the concert halls to hear him \u2013 Gould none the less seemed to steadily retreat from public view. He gave his last concert in 1964, confining himself to the recording studio for the rest of his short life. One of his final recordings was a second, markedly slower and more deliberate version of the Goldbergs in 1981. His <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmiagqoXaQY\" title=\"\">ideas on editing</a> were decades ahead of their time: he dreamed of a true democracy of recordings, when listeners would be able to edit their own versions of tracks, as we can now all do at the click of a mouse. He was also an eccentric hypochondriac, whose obsessive personality traits (he wore an&#xa0;overcoat and gloves no matter the temperature, and insisted on playing on&#xa0;the same ancient, <a href=\"http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/glenngould/028010-150-e.php?uid=028010-nlc003875&amp;uidc=recKey\" title=\"\">battered chair</a>) were exacerbated in his final years by cocktails of antidepressants and anxiety-suppressing pills that were, ironically, more harmful to him than helpful. He died shortly after his 50th birthday, on 4&#xa0;October 1982. Yet that was just the start of the Gould myth. The apparent weirdness of this reclusive genius has only added to the mystique as much as the iconoclasm of the recordings \u2013 his brilliant Bach, for sure, but also his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT0ghoOGn78\" title=\"\">wilfully idiotic Mozart</a> and tortuous Beethoven. But underneath the eccentric control-freakery was a much more normal person than has often been portrayed. He was a loner, certainly, but Gould was also one of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbT2kQaiP8c\" title=\"\">funniest and most playful musicians</a> there has ever been, he was an irrepressible and essential thinker on music, and his records and radio documentaries are fuelled by a ceaseless curiosity about the world and music's place in it. In what would have been his 80th year, we asked leading pianists what Gould means to them. As you'll discover, he's still a controversial figure.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iGY9tHHM63Q?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iGY9tHHM63Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><a href=\"http://www.angelahewitt.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Angela Hewitt </strong></a></h2> <p>Glenn Gould was an unavoidable presence when I was growing up in Ottowa.

When I was four or five, his programmes would be on <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/gould/\" title=\"\">CBC </a>(the Canadian Broadcasting Company) on a Sunday night.

I remember his Brahms, his Strauss, and of course his Bach. We would listen to his Bach discs \u2013 my parents were musicians too \u2013 and my dad would say: \"That's a ridiculous tempo. What's he playing it like that for?\" (By and large, if it was a slow piece, he would play it too fast, and vice versa.) But there was always something to admire. He was a&#xa0;wonderful pianist, and the way he played Bach was a sensation at the time. It was totally fearless, there's a ferocity, a youthful exuberance and energy in his playing. But I have never imitated him. I never wanted to come out like a bad copy of Glenn Gould. I first played the Goldberg Variations when I was 16. I remember going to the library and listening to Gould's recording, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bach:_The_Goldberg_Variations_%28Glenn_Gould_recording%29\" title=\"\">the famous 1955 one</a>. I only listened to it once, though, and I recorded the <a href=\"http://www.angelahewitt.com/record.php?record_id=31\" title=\"\">Well-Tempered Clavier</a> without even listening to his version. The thing with Gould is that there are wonderful and horrible things. You wonder why he played Mozart the way he did, and in Beethoven \u2026 I saw a&#xa0;film of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GchB9unYkOE\" title=\"\">cello sonatas with Leonard Rose</a>, and there's not much visible contact between the two.</p> <p>His memory and his ideas were extraordinary, but he was eccentric and incredibly neurotic as well. There's a lot of sadness in his life \u2013 that it ended so soon, that <a href=\"http://vleeptronz.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/glenn-pill-popper-genius-within.html\" title=\"\">he was taking all those pills</a>. I sometimes think the cult of Gould is a little exaggerated, so that we end up talking about the personality rather than how he played the piano.<br><em>* Angela Hewitt performs <a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/music/classical/tickets/angela-hewitt-piano-62768\"> at the Southbank Centre on 2 October</a></em>.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://stephenhough.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Stephen Hough</strong></a></h2> <p>Although Gould seemed to be ahead of his time - a prophet even - when he saw people preferring to listen to music on recordings rather than in the concert hall, what he didn't see was that technology would make recorded music so available and anarchic. The LP record's hi-fidelity made it possible for him to live comfortably on the profits of his royalties. It would be impossible for him to do this in today's higher-fidelity, streaming, reproducing marketplace where questions are being raised about the ability to maintain copyright control on any level. Nevertheless he created a new way of thinking about recorded music where the LP became an art form in itself - not just a replica of a live performance. And that first recording of the Goldberg Variations, so alive and alert and fresh - accompanied by legends of soaking arms, thick gloves and creaky seats - ushered in a new era in public relations. But beyond all the fashion and myth, Glenn Gould was a transcendental pianist. Even if all he touched turned to Gould (few artists are as recognisable across so many different styles) he nevertheless played with a heated passion of communication - made all the more telling and poignant delivered as it was from a reclusive apartment in the cold suburbs of Toronto.<br>* <em>Stephen Hough performs with the <a href=\"http://stephenhough.com/performances-2012.php#1012\">BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican on 12 October</a></em>. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.stevenosborne.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Steven Osborne</strong></a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N2YMSt3yfko?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N2YMSt3yfko\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I can't think of the Goldberg Variations without Gould. I find what he does so utterly compelling that I've never really thought to learn the piece myself: I think about the Goldbergs, and just imagine him playing, and there's no point in playing it like him again. Initially, it was his second recording of it, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2YMSt3yfko\" title=\"\">the one he made in 1981</a>, that I heard. The contrapuntal detail he finds in every bar is amazing; no one has equalled the way he plays the aria. But even more extraordinary is the line he creates that connects the whole piece. I'm not sure I have heard anything where every single note is placed so carefully, is so carefully thought about. For some people, it's too controlled, but I don't find that. And yet I prefer his 1955 recording of the piece. I can't think of a single artist who made such a profound change in their approach to a piece throughout their whole career. In the later record, he sometimes goes at half the speed of the earlier one. And what makes the earlier record so wonderful is its spontaneity \u2013 it's really happening in the moment, and it just makes me smile. It's a combination of the incredible technical control he has, but it's also that he is expressing something so incredibly powerful.

He was an eccentric, certainly, but the way he absorbed the music he played, the way he realised the polyphony of, say, Bach, makes him an interesting phenomenon and ensures his place in the pantheon of Bach players.</p> <p>But I am somehow frustrated and irritated by the result in his recordings. Frustrated because he seems to be living in an exclusively Glenn Gould world. The question is how he communicates his emotions through the sound of the instrument. There is a problem with his motoric, automatic approach to tempo, and there is a problem with his sound. It's not that it's not a beautiful sound, it's rather that there is&#xa0;no flexibility in the way he phrases the melodies and harmonies of what he's playing. And the irritation? That comes from the mannerisms and the affectations of his playing. What you are aiming for, as a listener, is to forget about the performer, to listen just to the music, but in Gould's playing, there&#xa0;is too much that disturbs to forget about him.There are many clever commercial reasons for the cult of Gould that existed during his lifetime and still does now. I'm not a fan nor a member of that club, but I'm more frustrated by the fact that for many people he is <em>the </em>Bach interpreter. There are many other people who are really remarkable in this music, and Gould is certainly not a person who plays Bach's music in a way that is without question-marks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/chHJdmyIiRk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/chHJdmyIiRk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><a href=\"http://www.intermusica.co.uk/piemontesi\" title=\"\"><strong>Francesco Piemontesi</strong></a></h2> <p>Gould's sound, his perspectives, the way he experimented with recording techniques, are often in my thoughts. I'm grateful he left so much interesting material for us to listen to, to read and to amuse ourselves with. His humour is really unique \u2013 take a look at his alter egos, the German musicologist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFFJX0SYPvw\" title=\"\">Dr Klopweisser</a>, the English conductor <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbT2kQaiP8c\" title=\"\">Sir Nigel Twitt-Thornwaite</a> and the hostile critic <a href=\"http://simeonjochaides.tumblr.com/post/51028621/glenn-gould-as-theodore-slutz-w-a-new-jersey\" title=\"\">Theodore Slutz</a>.</p> <p>But the most important aspect of the work Gould did was his love affair with the recording process. He thought of technology as a creative experience within classical music. There is a wonderful video <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JllD47HIees\" title=\"\">where you see him playing around </a>(with the help <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chHJdmyIiRk&amp;noredirect=1\" title=\"\">of different microphones) with different sound perspectives within a Scriabin pr\u00e9lude</a>.</p> <p>The sound landscapes he creates through this process remind me of a good <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/regisseur\" title=\"\"><em>r\u00e9gisseur</em> </a>who shows you the same scene from different angles and thereby creates contrasting psychological perspectives. (I'm thinking, for instance, of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDIdonK4XDQ&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">opening scene of David Lynch's Blue Velvet</a>.) From what I understand of Gould, he dismissed the almost religious atmosphere of the concert hall and was keen to establish a more equal relationship between artist and listener. He even encouraged the listener to \"manipulate\" the sound of recordings to create the ideal conditions for a particular piece of music. In an article <a href=\"http://academicalism.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/glenn-gould-copyfighter/\" title=\"\">published in the 60s he wrote</a>: \"There is nothing to prevent a dedicated connoisseur from acting as his own tape-editor, and exercising such interpretative predilections as will permit him to create his own ideal performance.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sfqS1rnn82A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sfqS1rnn82A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This process, in which he certainly was a pioneer, led to very inspiring results: you can hear, for instance, how he creates a sound landscape in his late recording of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfqS1rnn82A\" title=\"\">La Valse by Ravel</a>, almost as if he was playing with different microphone perspectives as he did in the Scriabin. Only, the Ravel recording was done without the aforementioned mic trick - it was his playing doing all of this.</p> <p>I find his courage to take a very distinctive path with his interpretations fascinating. And often with wonderful results - particularly in his recordings of 20th-century music. But with all the due respect for the quality of his playing and the poignance of his ideas, I never was a fan of his Bach. As far as I can see, he often regards Bach as abstract material, isolating the music from its historical perspective. But the works were written in a particular period of time, in a limited geographical part of Europe, in a well-defined Protestant view of the world. I have difficulty, too, listening to his readings of Mozart: he deliberately chooses to cross every line in terms of form, structure, harmony and musical language. The price for singularity is too high for my own taste.</p> <p>Gould's ideas of sound and interpretation flourish best without going out of context in 20th-century music - Prokofiev, Ravel, but also rarely performed works by Krenek and Strauss. Most composers from this time allow you more freedom to apply your own ideas.<br>* <em>Francesco Piemontese performs as part of </em><a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/music/classical/tickets/francesco-piemontesi-piano-62786\" title=\"\"><em>Southbank Centre's International Piano Series on 7 November</em></a><em> and at the </em><a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/music/event-detail.asp?ID=13036\" title=\"\"><em>Barbican with the BBC Symphony Orchestra on 1 December</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>There can't be a lot of people who have lain in bed at the <a href=\"http://www.trumphotelcollection.com/toronto/\" title=\"\">Trump hotel in Toronto</a> and watched <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decalogue\" title=\"\">The Decalogue</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/krzysztof-kieslowski\" title=\"\">Krzysztof Kieslowski</a>'s 10-hour take on the biblical edicts. And not just because the hotel has only lately opened. Fewer still can have done so before breakfast. Probably, just two: Paul Dano and his girlfriend.</p> <p>\"Zoe was not happy. She was like: why did you make me watch this? I said, well, we sort of chose it together. She didn't know it was going to be so sad. I cried a little bit too.\"</p> <p>Dano is taking a break from communist Warsaw to brunch at Trump's 31st-floor restaurant. The white walls swirl with 12ft flowers, their petals plaster, their eyes diamante. Big mirrors reflect black glitter fittings. A waiter produces, unbidden, a mini leather luggage rack for my bag. It sits between us, like a slumping baby. Dano orders a black coffee and the wagyu beef hot dog with braised short rib, caramelised onions, sauerkraut, pepperoncini and pommery mustard. \"It's like a sausage, right?\" The waiter confirms. \"Cool. I eat sausage for breakfast.\"</p> <p>The man who had his milkshake drunk in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hFTR6qyEo&amp;noredirect=1\" title=\"\">the best scene</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122167/there.will.be.blood\" title=\"\">best film of the century so far</a>, There Will Be Blood, is now 28 and still hungry. Between acting jobs and visiting Zoe (Kazan, an actor and writer, who is shooting in the city), he has been fuelling up on nutritious art. \"Bingeing on Kieslowski. Watching his movies and reading about him, that's fun.\" He's been writing a little (\"I'm sort of pecking away at something\"), playing guitar (he had a band, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/mookband\" title=\"\">Mook</a>), and not inhabiting someone else's head.</p> <p>\"When I'm not acting I like to go home and be really normal. So I usually grow out my hair until I get the next part. I brought nicer clothes because I'm with my girlfriend at a film festival but usually I'm pretty grubby. Not super-grubby but I should probably change my pants more than I do.\" He delicately folds the cuffs on his brown cardie.</p> <p>The fruits of Dano's previous labours are about to fall from the trees. First up: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148727/looper\" title=\"\">Looper</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/06/looper-review-toronto\" title=\"\">opened Toronto</a>, a screwy sci-fi from Rian Johnson, in which he plays an assassin in 2044 Kansas who goes awol after learning he must bump off his future self. Dano \u2013 snivelling, dim \u2013 is not the star; that's Joseph Gordon-Levitt, donning false nose and weird chin as the younger version of Bruce Willis. He does take the lead in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839492/\" title=\"\">Ruby Sparks</a>, a whimsical fantasy about a once-precocious novelist now scuppered by writer's block. To overcome it, he daydreams a character, Ruby, who then comes to life, and thinks she's his girlfriend. In extra-metafictional style, that film was scripted by Kazan in the flat they share in Brooklyn; she also stars as Ruby.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396456700\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348157102009/Paul-Dano-emleftem-in-Loo-010.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Dano <em>(left)</em> in Looper with Joseph Gordon Levitt.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Dano <em>(left)</em> in Looper with Joseph Gordon Levitt.

In Ruby Sparks, he plays God, literally dictating the actions of someone else; in Looper he has signed up to a career that means his end-date is mapped out ahead of him. Does fate appeal?</p> <p>\"Well, I do like the idea of consequence and how our actions play themselves out, but I am completely scared of knowing what the future would be like. I would never go near a fortune teller, even though it's probably not even real. I just don't wanna know. I like mystery and I like discovery.\"</p> <p>Dano speaks tentatively, with considered precision, in a mix of slang and scholarship. He is studied but also, when at ease, sweet and relaxed. \"I don't wanna come off like some super-douchey intellectual.\" He would like to be more open-minded. Kneejerk is not for him. \"It's really easy to judge quickly. I like to be somebody who will give everybody a chance. If you already know what a film is then that's boring to me. You don't want to spend months of your life on it. There needs to be some unknowable aspect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396456701\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348157192043/Creepy-preacher-Dano-in-T-010.jpg\" alt=\"Creepy preacher: Dano in There Will Be Blood.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creepy preacher: Dano in There Will Be Blood.

If you go see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149069/to-the-wonder\" title=\"\">the Terrence Malick</a>, should you be sleeping on it for one night? Those people put years into a film and I sort of wonder if it's healthy to comment right afterwards. It's totally terrifying to me. Last fall I was reading Machiavelli's The Prince. One of the biggest themes is adapting to change. I was thinking: God, how am I going to do that, because my instinct, especially in film, is the opposite. It's feeling we need to go backwards, not forwards.\"</p> <p>Yet Dano has long been progressive. His first big role, aged 17, was opposite Brian Cox in the brilliant, slippery paedophile drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/90411/l.i.e.\" title=\"\">L.I.E.</a>. In the film, he was the victim \u2013 a culpable cherub. Three years later, the parts had turned insidious: a predatory hippy in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/110895\" title=\"\">The Ballad of Jack and Rose</a>, a weasely Christian rocker in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/106256/king\" title=\"\">The King</a> (both 2005). These two roles fed into the performance of his career: creep preacher Eli Sunday in There Will Be Blood (2007). Paul Thomas Anderson cast him on the advice of Daniel Day-Lewis, who was impressed by his work on Jack and Rose \u2013 a good call, for with just four days' preparation, Dano made for a magnetic adversary. The year before, he was a mute aspirant pilot in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/114024/little.miss.sunshine\" title=\"\">Little Miss Sunshine</a> (whose directors he helped to recruit for Ruby Sparks). Since then, he has worked with Ang Lee (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/129971/taking-woodstock\" title=\"\">Taking Woodstock</a>) and Kelly Reichardt (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/138470/meek-s-cutoff\" title=\"\">Meek's Cutoff</a>), alongside Tom Cruise (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/136302/knight-and-day\" title=\"\">Knight and Day</a>) and with Jon Favreau (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143036/cowboys-and-aliens\" title=\"\">Cowboys and Aliens</a>), balancing bit parts in blockbusters with meaty leads in indie flicks such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130471/gigantic\" title=\"\">Gigantic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1570583/\" title=\"\">For Ellen</a>. Next up is Steve McQueen's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/01/benedict-cumberbatch-twelve-years-a-slave\" title=\"\">Twelve Years a Slave</a>. This is a career defined by laser-beam choices.</p> <p>Dano's own relationship with his past is stickier, however. While Looper toys with the idea of recognising yourself 30 years previously, Dano can clock in at any point with himself half his life back. \"I was in <a href=\"http://www.festival-deauville.com/DEV/index.php?lg=2\" title=\"\">Deauville</a> last week and they played clips of some films I'd been in and I was completely overwhelmed in a way I did not anticipate. I just thought: shit I have to get through these clips, just putting one hand up in front of my face.\" For professional reasons? \"Less so. More to do with memories and how certain things change.\" What has stayed the same? \"It's hard to say. Hopefully I'm more mature and a better person now. Not that I was a bad person. Hopefully I'm making progress of some kind.\"</p> <p>His singular physicality amplifies all this. Yet that face, which can look weedy on screen and result in him getting typecast as the whelp, is wide and sculptured up close. What's amazing is how quickly it tapers. It's as if someone brought home an Easter Island statue, then took a chisel to the chin.</p> <p>To don prosthetics, like his Looper co-star, holds great appeal, he says. \"That would be super-fun, I think. But I would never do anything like that to myself otherwise.\" Does he never get that urge to punch himself in the face, just for a change? \"Yeah, sure. Probably not for a change but for some self-destructive, masochistic rage.\"</p> <p>In fact, Dano is a man of remarkable self-possession. While the parts he plays are forever freaking out, he has his fingers firmly on the wheel. We trade aeroplane metaphors for a while (he dislikes flying in them, as he doesn't understand the engineering). \"I would rather be flying the plane than not flying it. In general, I think I try to fly it more than not. With acting certainly I have to fly it. I feel like I have to be responsible for what I'm participating in or putting out into the world.\" But isn't he only flying it in so far as Ruby Sparks is flying it \u2013 reading from someone else's script, responsible to them for their creation? \"But that's part of your leap of faith. So as long as the intent has some good qualities to it you can get through, whether the film works or not, or makes money or critically does well. That original intent is very important to me because then I can't get too upset. If the plane goes down I'd rather it be my fault than somebody else's.\"</p> <p>It is time to get the bill. The hot dog has gone, only the ketchup remains. We're both foggy on what wagyu actually means. An all-milk diet? That the cow has been stroked? \"It was good, but no, I don't think I would upgrade if I were paying. I'd be happy with a New York street hot dog. Lord knows that wouldn't have been stroked. But I'll pretty much eat any kind of meat.\" He smiles and we walk to the lift. Pit-stop complete, it is once more unto the breach. Communist Warsaw calls.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Good evening. Not much time for a preamble today, but you know what's at stake here. This is the first of Newcastle's six group games in the Europa League, and the top two teams in each group qualify for the last 512 of the tournament. It's their first match against a Portuguese side <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/apr/14/minutebyminute.sport\">since that traumatic night in Lisbon seven years ago</a>. It's probably fair to assume that today's match won't quite match that for intensity, not least because Newcastle have left most of their best players at home or on their bench.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news</strong></p> <p><strong>Maritimo (4-3-3):</strong> Salin, Briguel, Joao Guilherme, Roberge, Luis Olim; Rafael Miranda, Joao Luiz, David Simao; Heldon, Danilo Dias, Sami.<br>Subs: Lima De Oliveira, Joao Diogo, Marcio Rosario, Igor Rossi, Goncalo Abreu, Fidelis, Adilson.</p> <p><strong>Newcastle (4-2-3-1):</strong> Elliot; Perch, Williamson, Steven Taylor, Santon; Gosling, Bigirimana; Obertan, Vuckic, Amalfitano; Shola Ameobi.<br>Subs: Harper, Marveaux, Sammy Ameobi, Ferguson, Tavernier, Abeid, Campbell.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Robert Schorgenhofer (Austria)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>The first email of the evening</strong> comes from <em>the</em> James Brown. No, not him, he died in 2006; it's the other <em>the</em> James Brown, from <a href=\"http://www.sabotagetimes.com/author/jamesbrown/\">Sabotage Times</a>. \"Thought I'd tip you off to what is likely to be some of the strangest pre-match entertainment in European football tonight. When Leeds played there in 1998, George Graham's last weekend in charge, the pre-match warm up consisted of folk dancing with people with what looked like handkerchiefs on their heads and in their hands. Very Plymouth Brethren, not a cheerleader or confetti explosion in site.\"</p> <p>Whatever they did tonight, I missed the whole thing because of a pre-match trip to the overgrown boys' room. Bah!</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Peep peep! Maritimo, in an odd green-and-red strip, kick off from right to left. Newcastle are in hangover-baiting yellow.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> A very dangerous low cross from Simao is <em>just</em> missed by the sliding Heldon, eight yards from goal. Had he made contact with that \u2013 and he should have done \u2013 he would probably have scored.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4 min</strong> At least I think it's the fourth minute. For some bizarre reason, our TV has sliced the ESPN clock off the screen, so I can only see the seconds but not the minutes. Yes I do realise this could and probably will precipitate a farce. As I type this I can confidently we are in the 21st second of a minute.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>6 min</strong> The pitch isn't good. The ball is bobbling awkwardly, and that has contributed to a scruffy start to the match.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>9 min</strong> A low cross from Santon is only half cleared to Amalfitano, whose fancy pirouette gets him past a defender before the ball is booted away.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11 min</strong> Rob Elliot makes a fine save to keep the scores level. A corner from the left escaped a posse of defenders at the near post and was volleyed towards goal by Sami from eight yards. Elliot, diving to his right, palmed it over the top.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12 min</strong> Another vital save from Elliot! Simao's long pass forward slipped under the last man Williamson, which put Sami through on goal. He smashed it first time from the edge of the box but Elliot, who had charged from his line, saved it with his legs. Sami should probably have scored.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>15 min</strong> \"I think our lemon sorbet kit is the best since our custard cream effort of 2009,\" says Andrew Watson, inexplicably ignoring the skin-coloured masterpiece that is often on show at St James' Park.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Heldon, given far too much room on the right of the box, smashes a rising cross-shot wide of the far post. It's all Maritimo at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>19 min</strong> The dangerous Heldon wins another corner down the right. Newcastle aren't quite hanging on, but they've certainly been second best. Simao's corner is cleared easily.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>23 min</strong> Newcastle haven't really got going. Like so many teams away from home in Europe, they look like a team waiting for the wake-up call of going behind.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>24 min</strong> \"Can we have a mention of the stadium?\" says Rob Stead. \"From the camera angle it looks like they have decided to pump in crowd noise into the Colosseum.\" It is very strange. I haven't seen a single spectator, but there's a decent noise coming from somewhere. Unless it's all in my head. We all go a little mad sometimes.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> How did Newcastle not score there? When a corner was partially cleared, a loose ball broke to Williamson 14 yards from goal. His fierce shot was blocked by Roberge, who fell backwards as it hit him, and rebounded towards Shola Ameobi, a few yards from goal. He tried to plant a header inside the near post, but Salin charged across his line to beat it behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Gosling hits the post! Vuckic ran at the defence before playing the ball infield to Gosling. He took a touch and then, from inside the D, drilled an excellent low shot to the left of the keeper Salin that rattled off the outside of the post.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>30 min</strong> Now it's all Newcastle. Obertan chests the ball into space down the right wing, and as it bounces up he laces a fine effort from a ludicrous angle that whistles just wide of the far post.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> Maritimo play some neat stuff, with the forwards Sami and Damilo rotating nicely.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> This has been a strange game: somnolent for the most part, yet with four or five really good opportunities. My little book of 1990s music tells me it's had the rhythm of an early Mogwai song.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>37 min</strong> Carl Cort has a half chance but runs down a blind alley to the right of the penalty area. He should have used Vuckic, who was in loads of space to his left.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>40 min</strong> Anyone out there? I suspect the other game is a bit more interesting; Liverpool have just conceded a comedy equaliser.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>41 min</strong> Bigirimana, one of the two deep-lying midfield players, has had an impressive half for Newcastle. I know nothing about him, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gael_Bigirimana\">Wikipedia sure does</a>.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>43 min</strong> A crisp first-time cross from Obertan is blootered behind for a corner by Guilherme. The corner is cleared to Santon, who thrashes a ludicrous effort high and wide from 37.72 yards.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> ESPN have just shown a replay of a handball appeal against Luis Olim earlier in the half. A long throw dropped over a couple of players and hit him on the arm at the near post. He was unsighted up to a point, although you've seen them given.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45 min</strong> Bigirimana is booked for a foul on Luiz.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>45+2 min</strong> After a big scramble in the box, Elliot picks up what looked like a backpass from Williamson. Maritimo ease a few toys out of the pram, and Simao is booked for dissent.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Half time: Maritimo 0-0 Newcastle</strong> An enjoyable half of football ends goalless. See you in 10 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Half-time email</strong> \"Sorry,\" says Jeremy Boyle, \"but were both the strips shown in your photo chosen by the teams, or imposed on them by some randomiser operated by a single-celled amoeba? They both look like something someone might have hoyed up after too many Guinness...\" </p> <p>I realise I should probably have to go door-to-door like Jesus Quintana after such a revelation, but I quite like the Maritimo kit.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Newcastle kick off from right to left.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> Shola Ameobi hits the bar! That would have been a sensational goal. He escaped Guilherme on the halfway line down the left, ran all the way into the area, slipped the ball Messi-style inside the covering Roberge and then opened his body to curl a lovely effort across goal that clattered off the bar.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> \"Carl Cort?\" says Tim Dyer. Yep, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chrischarles/2009/12/quotes_of_the_decade_part_i.html\">Carl Cort</a>.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>51 min</strong> Newcastle should be ahead. Maritimo have arguably played the neater stuff but Newcastle have been far more decisive in the final third of the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Another fine interception from the superb Bigirimana launches a Newcastle break that ends with Obertan's low cross being booted clear from under the bar by Guilherme. Obertan should probably have done better with the cross after easily skinning the left back Olim.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>53 min</strong> Sammi Ameobi replaces the peripheral Haris Vuckic. He'll play alongside his brother Carl; they are the first brothers to play together Newcastle in Europe. I know this because John Champion on ESPN just told us.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> Maritimo bring on Fidelis for Heldon. I know what you're thinking, I know: how will it affect Maritimo's formation? I assume Fidelis will go straight up front, with Danilo Dias moving into a wider position.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> \"The stadium is small, about 6000 fans at max,\" says Brian Cruickshank. \"Maritimo were expanding it but had to halt the construction, so it's half finished right now, so heaven knows how many it can hold safely. Love Madeira though, the Toon Army will be in dreamland being there!\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> The Ameobis combine to give Amalfitano half a shooting chance on the left side of the box. He blitzes it towards orbit.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>59 min</strong> Fidelis misses a great chance, sweeping Sami's low cross wide of the near post from 12 yards. I'm not entirely sure how this game is goalless. Both sides have had some fantastic chances.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>61 min</strong> \"I like the fact that Sammi Ameobi has S.Ameobi on his back, while Shola just has Ameobi,\" says Jimmy McManners. \"I understand what they are trying to do, but it really is no help to anyone who doesn't already know what they look like is it?\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>63 min</strong> Sammiammiobi's is deflected wide for a corner, which Shola Ameobi heads over from the edge of the area.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Another chance for Shola Ameobi. He turns smoothly away from Guilherme in the box and drills a low shot across goal that is held at the second attempt by the sprawling Salin. Ameobi has shown great feet on a number of occasions tonight.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Newcastle are in total control now, with Maritimo playing almost entirely on the break. They will be slightly annoyed if they don't win this as they have been much the better side since half time.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>67 min</strong> Amalfitano is booked for a foul on Joao Luiz.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> On ESPN, Chris Waddle has just praised the teenager Bigirimana's performance. He looks like yet another triumph for Newcastle's peerless scouting department.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>70 min</strong> Danilo's angled pass, centre to right, is drilled back towards the near post by Sami, 15 yards from goal, and Elliot gets down smartly to palm it wide for a corner. That's his third excellent save of the night.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>71 min</strong> \"In response to Jimmy McManners,\" says Benjamin McKinney, \"I imagine Shola refused to add the further distinguishing H to his kit as it'd be a bit too much of an invitation any time he had a less-than-great game.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> A superb one-two between Sami and Simao ends with Sami's cross being cleared splendidly by Perch at the near post.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>75 min</strong> Maritimo make their second substitution, with Goncalo Abreu replacing Simao.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>76 min</strong> Newcastle bring on Shane Ferguson for Romain Amalfitano, who showed some nice touches but was on the periphery of the game for the most part.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>80 min</strong> The lively substitute Goncalo Abreu wins a corner down the left. He takes it himself, swinging it deep to the far post, and the under pressure Williamson heads behind for another corner. Before it's taken, Gabriel Obertan is replaced by Sylvain Marveaux. Obertan was his usual mix of the slick and the exasperating.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>81 min</strong> Now Maritimo hit the bar! Abreu's corner from the left was flicked on at the near post, and Roberge at the far headed towards goal from six yards. It hit the underside of the bar and bounced away off the head of the leaping Santon on the line. Had he not been there that would probably have bounced over the line.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>83 min</strong> Maritimo make their last substitution, with Danilo Dias replaced by ... he's been replaced by ... I'll get back to you on that one.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>84 min</strong> I've been so impressed with Bigirimana. He's done nothing amazing, but he's been so accomplished for a kid playing in one of the most mentally demanding positions on the field. Then again, the first time I saw Andy Reid, when Nottingham Forest hammered Gillingham 4-1 live on Sky in 2002-03, I sagely informed my friends that I'd seen a player. So, you know. (Not that Andy Reid wasn't a very nice player but, you know.)</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Santon is booked for not retreating 10 yards at a free kick. It's petering out now.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> Shola Ameobi's stinging 15-yard shot is blocked after an excellent drilled pass from Marveaux.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> There will be five minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90+1 min</strong> Goncalo Abreu comes infield from the left and drills a dipping 25-yard shot that Elliot fumbles around the post for a corner. It's headed clear by a combination of Sammi Ameobi and Williamson.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>90+3 min</strong> Maritimo are finishing the stronger. Briguel's outswinging cross from the right is headed fiercely but high and wide by Fidelis, 12 yards from goal.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>Full time: Maritimo 0-0 Newcastle</strong> As 0-0s go, that was pretty decent. Both sides played positively and had a few good chances, but some things just aren't meant to be. Like goals. Thanks for your emails; night.</p>",
  "<p>A firearms officer has said that Mark Duggan had been shot after raising a weapon at police, but said he had omitted this fact from the first statement he made about the incident.</p> <p>The shooting of Duggan on 4 August 2011 in Tottenham, north London, triggered riots that spread across the capital and to other cities across the country.</p> <p>The firearms officer was giving evidence at the trial of the man accused of supplying the gun to Duggan.</p> <p>The accused, Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, denies handing over the gun just 15 minutes before Duggan was confronted by police and shot.</p> <p>A jury at Snaresbrook crown court in east London heard the firearms officer, known as W70, give a dramatic and detailed account of the shooting from behind a screen.</p> <p>W70 told the jury Duggan raised a handgun and was shot, falling to the ground as officers surrounded him after having forced a taxi he was travelling in to stop.</p> <p>Hutchinson-Foster's barrister, Stuart Denney QC, asked W70 about the fact that his initial \"short-form\" report of the shooting did not mention Duggan raising a gun. However, this was mentioned in a fuller report made 48 hours later.</p> <p>Denney asked: \"Would it be entirely incorrect to suggest that you left out details such as that until you and your brother officers could check you were all singing from the same hymn sheet?\"</p> <p>\"That is not true, they are deliberately brief,\" the officer replied.</p> <p>Denny asked: \"Did you see any sign of a police officer bringing a non-police weapon to the scene? Did you see any police officer moving a non-police weapon?\"</p> <p>W70 replied no to both questions.</p> <p>W70's account was that Duggan appeared to raise the weapon from beneath the jacket he was wearing.</p> <p>The firearms officer told the jury that after police stopped the taxi, he was five metres away from Duggan. He said Duggan could be seen hiding something under the left-hand side of his jacket, in a pocket or in the waistband of his trousers.</p> <p>\"It very much appeared he was concealing something in his right hand with that jacket,\" W70 said.</p> <p>\"As he was pivoting in that position [to exit the car], concealing something in his right hand, at the same time he has very quickly drawn out his right hand from the left-hand side of his waistband and inside his jacket. He was holding a self-loading pistol or a handgun.</p> <p>\"As he has quickly drawn his right hand up and out of his jacket I have heard two shots from my left.\"</p> <p>Duggan fell to his knees clutching his chest and W70 said he pushed him to the ground. The officer said he had no doubt Duggan was holding a handgun.</p> <p>After the shots W70 and 12 other officers searched Duggan for a gun but could not find one.</p> <p>Denney, defending Hutchinson-Foster, asked what had happened to the gun.</p> <p>The firearms officers replied: \"I have no recollection of what happened to the firearm after I saw it exiting the jacket.\"</p> <p>In evidence earlier this week, the jury were told by an officer that a gun was found nearby. The crown say a BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun, modified to fire 9mm bullets, was recovered.</p> <p>The trial continues on Monday.</p>",
  "<p>So who decided that the iPhone and iPad would no longer have Google's map data \u2013 Apple or Google? \"Duh \u2013 not Google,\" a well-placed source at one of the companies told me on Thursday afternoon. Which means that the pain that Apple is now feeling, as people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/20/apple-maps-ios6-station-tower\">lambast it for flaws in its maps offering</a>, is entirely self-inflicted. </p> <p>Google, I hear from roundabout sources, is enjoying the bad press Apple is suffering. It would be surprising if its mappers could resist some schadenfreude, since they are very proud of their work; having it rejected wholesale must be galling. </p> <p>The same sources say that Google is preparing a Google Maps app for iOS6, which will appear in time. No official statement has been made and there will inevitably be questions over whether Apple will approve it in the App Store. (Apple might not, on the basis that it \"competes with existing functionality\", but would invite a further backlash if it did.)</p> <p>But if Apple knew that the experience with its new Maps data would be bad, why do it? Developers have been grumbling for months that there are missing details from the new non-Google maps, whose principal source seems to be Dutch company TomTom \u2013 although its app shows that it, at least, is able to provide detailed information, and <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/awjy10\">knows where Dudley is</a>. The maps have evolved as the iOS 6 software worked through its beta stages over the summer, adding <a href=\"http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/09/maps-evolution.jpeg\">detail with each update</a>. However they're still not as good overall as Google Maps. </p> <p>(Personally, when reviewing the iPhone 5 running iOS6 over the course of the past week, the issue of how the maps looked didn't arise, because in the rural location where I live there isn't much detail anyway. I tested the satnav facility \u2013 specifically the turn-by-turn navigation \u2013 over a number of medium-length journeys and found it good, able to generate a route dynamically when a road was closed, and offer multiple routes between locations. I didn't use it to try to find a spot in an unfamiliar city. Perhaps that would have given more clues.) </p> <p>But mapping is now a key function in smartphones: for the weary or lost traveller, it has become the essential way of finding somewhere or something. No more fumbling for paper maps; no more (or not much) querying passers-by who might anyway speak a different language for directions. </p> <p>So getting it wrong is on a par with having a phone that loses connectivity when you're holding it wrong \u2013 the latter of course being a problem Apple struggled with over the iPhone 4 in 2010. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/24/steve-jobs-biography-antennagate\">Antennagate</a>\" (which Steve Jobs thought, wrongly, was a smear) arose out of the company's secretive nature: it couldn't let people be seen testing the phone in public, so never got enough feedback to know that the aerial design could do strange things near the human hand. By the time it did, it was too late to change. </p> <p>However given the rumblings among developers about iOS6 since the first betas were launched, why did Apple go ahead with dropping Google? The <a href=\"http://www.macstories.net/news/ios-5-wont-feature-apples-maps-service-google-maps-still-in/\">rumours that it would have been around since May 2011</a>. Apple has been quietly buying mapping companies to build up its strength. </p> <p>Why, though, buy companies when you can just use Google's? This isn't like the iPhone 4 antenna design; this is an entirely intentional move. The only logical reason is that Apple is trying to cut yet another tie to a company, and data, which it doesn't and cannot control; to reduce its dependency on a third party. And if users suffer in the short term, Apple is prepared to put them through it, because if there is one dogma that lies deep in Apple's corporate DNA, it is that it must control its own destiny. And apparently dumping Google as a partner is what its managers feel they must do to prevent that rival in the future deciding what it can or cannot do. Apple appears to have decided that Google might, one day, hold it hostage over mapping, and decided to avert that day.</p> <p>You don't have to look far for the previous example where Apple's actions seemed retrograde. When the original iPhone launched without support for Adobe's Flash player, people were aghast. The suggestion that Apple would cave in and support Flash resurfaced again and again; but Apple had decided that Flash was bad news on mobiles. Its testing had found that it made the browser liable to crash, slowed it down (because the mobile processor struggled to run the code) and anyway meant that Apple would be forever yoked to Adobe \u2013 reliant on it to update Flash, which would happen at Adobe's rather than Apple's pace. </p> <p>The expectation that Apple would cave in grew even greater as Android rose in importance, and did support Flash, although nobody was ever able to say that it offered a great experience. Meanwhile, many sites began offering video in formats the iPhone could use; Steve Jobs had already persuaded Eric Schmidt at Google to offer YouTube's content in the H.264 format that it could play, and others followed suit. The final act came last year, when Adobe announced that it was giving up the development of Flash for Android; Apple had prevailed.</p> <p>Maps though are even more important than playing video and so Apple's actions look even more bizarre. Is it really threatened by Google's strength here? Clearly, yes. The other smartphone platforms are RIM's BlackBerry, which like Apple uses TomTom, and Microsoft's Windows Phone, whose mapping is now powered by Nokia \u2013 finally getting the benefit of it \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a35.6bn) acquisition of Navteq in 2007.</p> <p>Google has spent almost a decade building up its mapping business to reach the point where it is seen as the gold standard for online cartography, enhanced by satellite imagery and its own Street View data to create a picture of the world that is more accurate and detailed than anything that has ever existed. If you somehow had the resources, you could at least create a replica of pretty much the whole planet from the data on Google's servers \u2013 true, you'd only have the shells of the buildings, but it would suffice.</p> <p> <strike> Yet Apple doesn't want it. Indeed, it kept certain of the functionality of the Google Maps systems out of iOS </strike> Google however wouldn't license turn-by-turn navigation to Apple under the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/terms\">terms of the Google Maps API</a>. As <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/06/ask-ars-why-did-apple-have-to-ditch-google-to-add-turn-by-turn-nav/\">Ars Technica points out</a>, \"Google restricts those making apps from its APIs from offering real-time navigation or route guidance in their own apps\".</p> <p>Meanwhile turn-by-turn navigation has been available for years on Android phones, as well as the ability to turn the onscreen map around to orient it to what you're seeing, instead of having to turn yourself. </p> <p>Apple clearly thought those were necessary to have in order to compete with Android, and with Nokia's Windows Phone (which gets Nokia-owned Navteq directions). They've arrived now on iOS 6 along with all the annoyance. </p> <p>Yet Apple is slowly, carefully, updating the maps it has. While some of the satellite pictures show bizarre artefacts (collected on <a href=\"http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com/\">The Amazing iOS6 Maps Tumblr</a> with <a href=\"http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com/post/31921529568/battersea-bridge-in-london-uk-i-think-ill-find\">Battersea Bridge</a> being a particular favourite, looking more like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge\">Tacoma Narrows bridge</a> before it fell apart), they're all just bits of data that Apple will implacably try to improve on. </p> <p>Apple isn't a stranger to launches and products going wrong. I recall trying out the iPod nano in September 2005, and noticing that the screen scratched easily, a fact that was widely reported and seen by some as indicating that Apple's reign at the top of the music player tree was over. Instead, it sold more than ever. Then there were iPod batteries that died; the iPod kept selling. The iPhone's price was cut by $200 weeks after launch; Steve Jobs offered $100 in vouchers, but no apology. The list is long, and yet somehow Apple keeps coming out of the other side of it.</p> <p>Whether this will be the one that finally makes the difference is impossible to tell. Some people may decide that they like having the satnav function, and discover that the maps are OK. Others may be put off altogether, and choose a different phone (expect Nokia to capitalise on this). It is a setback. But for Apple, dumping Google has brought the certainty that it can decide what its maps do. For bitter customers who feel that's not good enough, there aren't many options except to use <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/\">Google Maps in the browser</a>, or count the hours until the iOS app is released. It might be a while.</p> <p>(<em>Updated to point out that Google precluded Apple from using turn-by-turn navigation under the Google Maps API.</em>)</p>",
  "<p>Fashion retailer SuperGroup, famed for its Superdry brand, has become the latest UK company to receive a bloody nose from shareholders after nearly one in five either failed to back or voted against the reelection of co-founder Julian Dunkerton.</p> <p>There were also robust votes against chairman Peter Bamford, non-executive directors Steven Glew and Indira Thambiah, and new chief operating officer Susanne Given.</p> <p>Concerns had been raised by shareholder groups before Thursday's annual general meeting, with the Association of British Insurers putting an \"amber alert\" on the retailer's remuneration report \u2013 its second most severe warning \u2013 while shareholder group Pirc also recommended investors vote against the pay proposals.</p> <p>The pay deal drawn up for Given, who was poached from John Lewis, was singled out for particular criticism as her package includes a \u00a3350,000 base salary, as well as a \"golden hello\" worth \u00a31.1m in shares. Almost 19% of investors either voted against her election as a director or abstained and nearly 17% failed to back the remuneration report.</p> <p>The votes against directors were substantial given Dunkerton, who owns 26m shares, is understood to have exercised his right to vote. But the last year has been a rollercoaster ride for investors who backed what was previously regarded as one of the most successful stock market flotations of recent years. After listing at 500p in 2010 shares in the company, famous for its trademark T-shirts, hooded tops, check shirts and jogging bottoms, rocketed to a high of nearly \u00a319. Since then a series of profit warnings and mistakes \u2013 including a misfiring IT system and accounting errors \u2013 have weighed heavily on the company's value.</p> <p>Last month the resignation of Theo Karpathios, who founded the business with Dunkerton, was added to the catalogue of woes. On Thursday the shares closed down 10p at 625p.</p> <p>With a profit alert in April partly blamed on a mix-up between a plus and a minus sign in its financial forecasts, investors appear to be concerned about the retailer's financial rigour. There was a large vote at the AGM against the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as auditors.</p> <p>SuperGroup's most recent figures, published last week, showed signs of light at the end of the tunnel for the retailer, whose celebrity fans include Pippa Middleton and singer Ed Sheeran, as it announced a rise in first quarter sales.</p>",
  "<p>America has the largest per capita prison population <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21555611\">in the world</a>. When you combine the local jail, state and federal prison populations, there are approximately 2.3 million people currently behind bars and another 5 million or so under some form of correctional supervision. A lot of attention is focused on this demographic group and a lot of data is gathered about their background and circumstances while they are imprisoned. We know their age, sex, race and, of course, the crime that got them locked up. We know that men are incarcerated at a rate <a href=\"http://www.prb.org/Articles/2012/us-incarceration.aspx\">14 times higher</a> than women. We know that African Americans have an imprisonment rate <a href=\"http://www.centerforhealthandjustice.org/FOJ%2011-10.pdf\">seven times higher</a> than whites; we know their recidivism chances upon release are high and their job prospects low, and so on. Yet, because of outmoded data collection strategies that fail to count the prison population in national data sets, beyond the tiny cocoon of prison, these people are largely <a href=\"http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/ascii/p10.txt\">invisible</a>.</p> <p>Because African Americans are so over-represented in the prison system, to the point where mass incarceration of blacks in the last 30 years has been <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/01/16/145175694/legal-scholar-jim-crow-still-exists-in-america\">compared (as a form of social control) to the days of Jim Crow segregation laws</a>, the lack of proper counting measures has particular implications for that community. Most national surveys, including the US census, fail to fully count the inmate population.</p> <p>And this failure has dramatic implications for social policy-making. In a new book called <a href=\"https://www.russellsage.org/publications/invisible-men\">Invisible Men, Mass Incarceration and the Myth of Black Progress</a>, author and social scientist Becky Pettit makes the point that because mainstream collection methods fail to count many of the most disadvantaged people in society, they are subsequently disregarded when resources that could, and should, benefit them are being distributed. </p> <p>Pettit finds that when the prison population is added back into the existing data, serious discrepancies with current estimations of black progress emerge. Black voter turnout in the 2008 election, which was thought to be at historic highs, was <a href=\"http://www.russellsage.org/about/myth-black-progress-new-rsf-book-shows-how-mass-incarceration-masks-persistent-racial-inequality\">overestimated</a> by 13% overall, and by over 64% for young male high school dropouts. Employment rates for black youths, particularly for dropouts, are far worse than generally believed. When the inmate population is excluded, employment rates are <a href=\"http://www.russellsage.org/about/myth-black-progress-new-rsf-book-shows-how-mass-incarceration-masks-persistent-racial-inequality\">estimated</a> at an already low 42%. When inmates are included, that figure <a href=\"http://www.russellsage.org/about/myth-black-progress-new-rsf-book-shows-how-mass-incarceration-masks-persistent-racial-inequality\">sinks</a> to a shocking 26%. If policy-makers fully understood the severity of the situation that three out of four black high school dropouts are unemployed \u2013 and that they are also the demographic most likely to end up in prison \u2013 more attention might be focused their way.</p> <p>Racially biased as our criminal justice system is, there is probably no stronger indicator of a person's chance of ending up in prison than the level of education they manage to attain. A <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/education/09dropout.html\">2009 study</a> (just using census data) by researchers at Northeastern University found that one in ten young male high school dropouts end up in some form of detention, compared to one in 35 for high school graduates. And, as always, they found the picture to be worse for African Americans, of whom one in four dropouts will end up incarcerated. </p> <p>But even among African Americans, education changes everything. In a 2011 <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4853&amp;context=fss_papers\">research paper</a> titled \"The Black Poor, Black Elites, and America's Prisons\", Yale law Professor James Forman Jr cites research that shows that while poor uneducated black men are vastly over-represented in our prisons and jails, black men with college degrees are not much more likely than their white counterparts to end up in prison.</p> <p>As things stand, the bureau of justice statistics <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/story/154587/1_in_3_black_men_go_to_prison_the_10_most_disturbing_facts_about_racial_inequality_in_the__u.s._criminal_justice_system\">estimates</a> that if things continue as they are, one in every three black men will end up spending some time in prison. But considering the extremely close links between educational achievement (or, more correctly, the lack thereof) and the likelihood of a prison term, if policy-makers truly wanted to reduce the prison population, then \"It's education, stupid\" should be the motto falling off everyone's lips.</p> <p>But before attempting to solve a problem, understanding the full extent of it ought to be indispensable. Making sure all prisoners are counted, rather than excluded from many data sets, would be a good way to start.</p>",
  "<p>Police have called on two feuding crime families in east Manchester to end the dispute that allegedly led to two police officers being shot dead in Tameside earlier this week.</p> <p>Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, died while responding to a report of a burglary at Abbey Gardens, on the Hattersley estate in Mottram, on Tuesday morning. A grenade was also used in the attack. A postmortem examination revealed both officers died of gunshot wounds.</p> <p>On Thursday, assistant chief constable Garry Shewan said it would be wrong to portray Manchester as being in the middle of a gang war. \"This would overestimate what we have got here: clearly two feuding criminal families,\" he said.</p> <p>He went on to declare that \"enough is enough\", and that Tuesday was a watershed moment that had to be the end. Over the last decade, gun crime has fallen in Manchester year on year. The force has witnessed the largest reduction in gun crime anywhere in the UK.</p> <p>Shewan said a 22-year-old man in Netherley, Merseyside, had been arrested under the Communications Act 2003 after an offensive Facebook page was set up following the officers' deaths.</p> <p>The arrest was thought to be linked to a Facebook page that appeared to praise Dale Cregan, the 29-year-old man police arrested on suspicion of four murders, for his alleged involvement in the killings. It also suggested he should be awarded an OBE. The 22-year-old was in police custody for questioning.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Greater Manchester chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, visited the scene where the officers were killed. He stood in silence alongside colleagues, heads bowed, among the bouquets left in tribute. He described them as \"two wonderful human beings, two very dedicated officers\". He said earlier in the day he had spoken to both their families and recounted some of the kindness they had shown to victims of crime. And he said the families were grateful for the \"massive show of public support\".</p> <p>Fahy said: \"The two families are just overwhelmed by the huge support they are getting right across the country.\" Officers were in discussion with the Crown Prosecution Service about charges, he added, and he expected that there would be developments in the next 24 hours.</p> <p>Speaking earlier, his colleague Shewan said: \"In the last 48 hours, since the tragic death of our two officers, there has been a huge amount of support from the public through our website and on social media. However, there are also a small number of people who have posted malicious and upsetting comments online, causing outrage to many people and prompting them to ask us what we are doing to deal with these people.\"</p> <p>He said police took reports of this nature very seriously, as demonstrated by the arrest. Shewan said they had become \"very aware of the derogatory and offensive comments\", but the overwhelming public reaction on social media remained one of support.</p> <p>An online book of condolence has attracted many thousands of messages from wellwishers and a Facebook page set up by the force has been viewed by more than a million people.</p> <p>On Wednesday night a member of the public set up a Facebook page offering cover so Greater <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester\" title=\"\">Manchester</a> police officers could attend the funerals of Bone and Hughes. Shewan said he could not thank the public of Greater Manchester and the UK enough for their support and good wishes since Tuesday.</p> <p>It was, he added, the worst day in his policing career, and the force was still coming to terms with \"the loss of two wonderful, first-class young officers\". He said it would do everything it could to rid Greater Manchester of organised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime\" title=\"\">crime</a> .</p> <p>An unnamed source claimed in the Manchester Evening News that if you knew the right people, you could pick up grenades for as little as \u00a350.</p> <p>But the force dismissed claims that the gun used in the shootings had been supplied by Steven Greenoe, an American who was jailed in the US for importing gun components to the UK.

  "<p>Lost in Showbiz has long despaired of the public airing of politicians' music tastes. It boggles, mortified, at the divulging of the contents of the iPod, the knowing reference to the oeuvre of Dizzee Rascal in the policy speech. It recalls with dismay the day, in 2004, when the Conservative party conference broadcast a series of \"lighthearted talking-head interviews\" with senior politicians, thus alerting the world to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/oct/05/popandrock.conservatives2004\" title=\"\">Dr Liam Fox's love of Scissor Sisters</a> and the possibility that, at some point in the past, Michael Ancram may well have punched the air to Meat Loaf. It&#xa0;attends regular post-traumatic counselling sessions in the belief that it&#xa0;can one day put its life back together following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/22/liberal-democrats-conference\" title=\"\">the incident last year</a> when it&#xa0;was present in a room where the president of the Liberal Democrats performed a comical version of the Ting Tings' That's Not My Name.</p> <p>And it asks: will no one in Westminster think of the parlous state of the music industry? Sales of CDs are in&#xa0;freefall. LiS can think of no greater disincentive to purchase an album than a member of the cabinet \u2013 or, indeed, the opposition \u2013 giving it a public thumbs-up. No wonder people are illegally downloading music: they're too ashamed to go into shops and publicly buy it, tainted as it now is by your patronage. LiS turns to the politician keen to favour the nation with news of his love for the <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/jessieware/wildest-moments-star-slinger\" title=\"\">Star Slinger remix of Jessie Ware's Wildest Moments</a> and says: why don't you just go and squirt Super Glue through the locks of your local HMV while you're about it?</p> <p>It can't work out which it likes less; the terrible sense that someone has told politicians to say they like an artist \u2013 apparently in the deranged belief that there are people out there who prepare to exercise their democratic right by carefully reading the parties' manifestos, weighing up their various views on the economy and law and order, then asking themselves: \"But do any of them like Noah and the Whale?\" \u2013 or the terrible sense they may genuinely like them and the deleterious effect on its subsequent enjoyment of the music involved. As an example, let us briefly examine the sorry case of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/dec/18/albums-2009-xx\" title=\"\">the xx's debut album</a>. Once, its hushed sensual sound seemed to perfectly conjure an atmosphere of heavy-lidded, post-coital languor. Then LiS learned that it was David Cameron's preferred soundtrack for \"cuddles\" in the afternoon. Now, when the xx's debut album appears on its iPod playlist, LiS scrolls hastily past, shuddering with the effort required to suppress an involuntary yell of horror. No more hushed sensuality and evocation of heavy-lidded post-coital languor for you, the xx, just&#xa0;the image of the prime-ministerial buttocks heaving at&#xa0;3pm.</p> <p>And yet, LiS finds itself curiously bucked by the news that the recipient of said \"cuddles\" is apparently a fan of rapper Azealia Banks, the author of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg_NP0VP4FI\" title=\"\">Barbie Shit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jBCnQYkUhQ\" title=\"\">Hood Bitch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zuCzboMmdo\" title=\"\">P.U.S.S.Y.</a>, and the woman behind the forthrightly named online radio station&#xa0;<a href=\"http://kunt.fm/\" title=\"\">Kunt FM</a>. \"Just met Samantha Cameron \u2026 She told me she loves 212 \u2026 *mind blown*\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AZEALIABANKS/status/247795632415309825\" title=\"\">she tweeted</a> this week, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AZEALIABANKS/status/247795925215506433\" title=\"\">adding</a>: \"Samantha Cameron is the Michelle Obama of Britain \u2026 This is&#xa0;actually crazy right now.\"</p> <p>But after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2012/sep/18/samantha-cameron-loves-azealia-banks\" title=\"\">the revelation</a> came the carping. LiS notes with some sadness the inevitable mocking news stories that followed, including, alas, some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/18/mrs-camerons-diary-lfw\" title=\"\">in this newspaper</a>. They played heavily on the apparent gulf between the daughter of Sir Reginald Adrian Berkeley Sheffield, eighth baronet, and Banks, a&#xa0;self-styled \"hoodlum nigga\", whose path to fame included a song in which she offered the diverting suggestion that she could \"suck a 10-inch cock drier than a raisin\". The general consensus of opinion seemed to be that the prime minister's wife couldn't possibly have listened to the lyrics of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Jv9fNPjgk\" title=\"\">212</a>, or if she had, she couldn't possibly have understood them.</p> <p>To those journalists, LiS can only say: how patronising. What's the first thing that springs to mind when you look at Samantha Cameron? That's right: there's a woman who understands the language of the streets, a&#xa0;woman who immediately grasped that when Banks offers to \"bust your eight\", she's referring to the belief that a numerical eight looks like a vertical pair of testicles, and is thus offering to&#xa0;bring her amorata to&#xa0;orgasm!</p> <p>And besides, in the enormously unlikely event that she didn't: have you ever heard of the&#xa0;internet, and, more specifically, a site called <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/\" title=\"\">rapgenius.com</a>? A few clicks of the mouse and Banks's dense mesh of&#xa0;allusions and slang are <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/Azealia-banks-212-lyrics\" title=\"\">explained</a> in language even Sir Reginald Adrian Berkeley Sheffield, eighth baronet, could understand: \"'Plus your bitch might lick it': here Banks explains that the girlfriend, the female partner of the male she is speaking to, is potentially a&#xa0;lesbian, continuing the themes of sexual power&#xa0;roles, and suggesting that Banks&#xa0;is so hot his girlfriend might cheat with her.\"</p> <p>LiS can only hope that Banks's work has a permanent and lasting influence on her most famous fan. It looks forward to an edgy new range of Smythson stationery: \"Nothing says Smythson like the rich rustle of a tissue-lined envelope, or the intense colour and delicate design of our exquisitely embossed motifs, or indeed their ability to communicate the message that if your correspondent's bitch keep hating she gon' get sprayed up.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain's allies in the Afghan war has been been sacked in a political shakeup by President Hamid Karzai that saw 10 provincial governors replaced or removed.</p> <p>Karzai announced he would remove Mohammad Gulab Mangal from office as governor of the vital province of Helmand, a central focus in the Afghan war and the responsibility of the British military.</p> <p>Karzai's office declined to say why Mangal had been removed or if he would be reappointed to another governorship or political position.</p> <p>The southern province was the centre of the Afghan drug trade and a Taliban stronghold, making it a focal point for NATO and Afghan officials. Helmand claimed nearly double the number of coalition soldiers' lives compared to Kandahar, the second most deadly province in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Mangal played a key role in efforts to regain control of the province, quickly winning favour among international military and diplomatic officials. When he came to office in Helmand in 2008, he'd held governorships continuously since 2004 starting in Paktika and then moving to Laghman.</p> <p>He presided over Helmand during one of the most critical periods of the war, overseeing the influx of surge troops as NATO forces launched the Marjah offensive in 2010, one of the biggest campaigns of the Afghan war.</p> <p>\"Before his governorship there was complete insecurity in the province,\" said Muhammad Hassan Haqyar, an independent political analyst in Kabul, who explained that the province saw major improvements under Mangal's watch. \"There were also the good relations he had with the foreigners. They were definitely good for the people of Helmand. If you have good relations with international organizations, it helps you bring reconstruction to the province.\"</p> <p>The British embassy in Kabul put out a statement saying Mangal \"made a real difference to the life of ordinary Afghans in Helmand\".</p> <p>Previous attempts to oust Mangal by Karzai led to direct intervention from senior British figures, as he was seen as a man with whom they could work.</p> <p>Still, in manyways Mangal remained a controversial figure. Despite his generally positive relations with foreigners, the release of the Wikileaks diplomatic cables in 2010 revealed that he did not always have glowing reviews of his international counterparts.</p> <p>In the cables, Mangal privately criticised the British military for not leaving their bases enough and having only limited interaction with the local population.</p> <p>Among locals, there were also allegations that Mangal and his administration used the poppy eradication program to extort farmers and generate revenue for his administration. While these allegations were never confirmed, they were common.</p> <p>Despite these allegations, a number of locals say that during Mangal's tenure as governor the province, witnessed dramatic improvements in both security and development.</p> <p>Habiba Sadat, a member of parliament from Helmand, says that while she never had any personal problems with the governor, he was regarded as a divisive figure in the province.</p> <p>\"When I myself used to go to Helmand people would come cry to me because they had problems with the current governor. Also the security problems have recently increased and there were several attacks against police and checkpoints,\" she says. \"This was the right decision. A lot of people in Helmand are happy about it.\"</p> <p>Throughout Afghanistan, a total of 10 governors, including Mangal, will be removed or reassigned. The move comes during efforts by the Karzai administration to improve government efficiency to address concerns among foreign donors.</p> <p>\"We needed to change some governors because some provinces need better governance and better governments, some provinces needed fresh blood, and some governors will change to other provinces,\" says Hamid Elmi, a spokesman for Karzai. \"Of course some governors were not able to carry out their duties and they were not efficient any more so we needed fresh blood.\"</p> <p>In Afghanistan, governors are appointed by the president rather than elected. The 10 provinces with new governors include Kabul, Helmand, Takhar, Faryab, Logar, Laghman, Wardak, Baghlan, Nimroz, and Badghis.</p>",
  "<p>It is the kind of kitchen where rustling up a plate of beans on toast would be like playing Chopsticks on a Steinway. Electrolux has launched what must be the world's most expensive domestic kitchen and there's not a toaster or microwave in sight.</p> <p>Instead, an arsenal of blast-chillers, sous-vide vacuum packers and ovens powered by computer hard drives, all apparently designed for super-rich MasterChef obsessives, has gone on sale with a lettuce-wilting price tag of \u00a376,000, rising to more than \u00a3200,000 if you want the very best ovens. Cupboards, drawers and work surfaces are your own business, adding upwards of \u00a3100,000 for the best finishes, say designers. Welcome to the quarter of a million pound kitchen.</p> <p>In lean economic times, it is a phenomenon that might seem absurd if not obscene, but it is, says the Swedish company, a logical consequence of the aspirational classes' growing obsession with food and the impact of high technology on cooking culture.</p> <p>The market is those who marvel at the tricks of molecular gastronomy pioneered by science-obsessed chefs like Heston Blumenthal and Ferran Adri\u00e0, and for whom it is simply no longer good enough to bang a roast in the oven for a couple of hours and hope for the best.</p> <p>\"We do a short rib of beef cooked at 68 degrees centigrade for 72 hours,\" explains Tom Aikens, the Michelin-starred chef who has been enlisted to promote the Electrolux kitchen at the kind of extravagant launch event more normally laid on by fashion labels or sports car companies. \"Once cooked you pop it in the blast chiller so it sets, slice it into neat pieces, warm it in the sous-vide, then flash it in a hot oven. You could do that in this kitchen.\"</p> <p>Perhaps Aikens could, but would anyone who can afford to buy it have the skill or the time? This week Gwyneth Paltrow, the Hollywood actor, popped into see the demonstration model set up in London, as did James Duigan, a personal trainer whose clients have included Hugh Grant and Elle Macpherson.</p> <p>\"I am sure some people will buy it only because they believe it's the pinnacle of what is on the market,\" said Henrik Otto, the designer. \"But on the other hand they probably have a private chef who will use it for them. [The market] is people who holiday in the Caribbean, fly there on their private jet and own their own island.\"</p> <p>When Electrolux divulges that the vacuum packer which looks like a laptop costs \u00a36,200, and the blast chiller with an iPod-style control panel is \u00a311,750, you can see why.</p> <p>The company is not alone in seeking to capitalise on the rage for cheffy cooking. Lancashire firm Sous-vide Tools has reported a quadrupling of sales in the last 18 months of vacuum sealers and water baths, which have been made fashionable by TV cooking programmes, and now sells more than 100 kits a month. John Lewis, which started stocking sous-vide machines in 2010, said sales were up 22% on the same time last year.</p> <p>Electrolux has calculated its Grand Cuisine brand has a potential market of 50,000 people around the world, many with multiple properties and for whom money is no object.</p> <p>\"Some people have bought two of everything,\" Otto says. \"We have some clients who couldn't choose between the induction hob and the gas hob so bought both.\" Each for the price of a small car.</p> <p>Some of the equipment is so complicated \u2013 the combination oven apparently washes itself if you add soap and water \u2013 that installation comes with two training sessions with a professional chef. It is about as far from a traditional country kitchen as you could get.</p> <p>A wok hob is known as the \"surround induction zone\" and frying pans are out. Instead there is an unnerving \"sear hob\" which heats to 275 degrees and is about as far from a greasy spoon's griddle as it is possible to be. Because of its chromium coating, it appears to emit almost no heat at all until Aikens drops a dollop of lemon-infused pancake batter on to it and it sizzles into life.</p> <p>\"You don't want children to play with this kind of kit,\" says a member of Electrolux's marketing team.</p> <p>Aikens particularly likes the \u00a32,000 food mixer, saying with the admiration of a chef who knows about the rough and tumble of kitchen life: \"You could chuck it against the wall and it wouldn't break. It's like Terminator.\"</p> <p>It is clear this equipment could quickly become a coveted boy's toy, attractive to premiership footballers for whom it would be no more than a week's wages. Otto compares owning the kitchen to owning a Ferrari, and the controls are equally sensitive.</p> <p>The oven is equipped with a touch screen panel that allows the temperature and humidity to be controlled to the nearest degree and percentage point. You can even plug in a computer memory stick loaded with programmes for specific recipes, all of which leads Electrolux's vice-president, Mike Hutchinson, to make a claim that has surely never before been made on behalf of an oven: \"It gives you a link into the future.\"</p> <p>\"Cooking is no longer just domestic home cooking,\" says Aikens as he delicately turns his pancakes. \"It's now a bit edgy. I see men cooking now and its not seen as a sissy's job. It is very much a man's job as much as a woman's.\"</p> <p>The result, the launch of the Grand Cuisine range seems to suggest, is the peculiar rise and rise of the kitchen as 21st century status symbol. But there is a downside, says Otto, especially if your souffles flop or your chicken comes out pink: \"If you own this, you would never be able to blame your equipment again.\"</p>",
  "<p>The meeting took place on Monday last week in building 101 on the main road just outside the town of Gereshk. At one end of a long table was an oversized portrait of Hamid Karzai, and sitting opposite it was Saleem Rodi, the quietly spoken district governor. Rodi was chairing this gathering, huddled around him were the most senior security officials in the area \u2013 Afghan and British \u2013 and they were in conspiratorial mood.</p> <p>The subject was the insurgency, their aim was surprise, and their plans had a name: Operation Qalb (Heart).</p> <p>Rodi said only the people in the room knew the details of the forthcoming attack, and secrecy was paramount if the Taliban were to be caught unawares; other missions had been hindered by leaks. He wanted to hear from everyone around the table about how civilian casualties could be minimised if and when the shooting started. \"We have sacrificed a lot of blood already,\" he said.</p> <p>Helmand province has been the fiercest battleground in Nato's fight with the Taliban over the last 11 years, and its central district of Nahr-e Saraj has become the most violent area within it. There is no place quite like it.</p> <p>Eighteen British soldiers have died there since the beginning of the year, nine in the last 10 weeks. Afghan soldiers have perished in even greater numbers, 25 since April. Hours before this security meeting, a government official was assassinated less than a mile away.</p> <p>The violence here has polarised opinions about the state of the country. No other place in Afghanistan better reflects the competing views about the future \u2013 the claims and counter claims about what can and cannot be achieved in the two years before combat troops from Nato's International Security and Assistance Force (Isaf) leave Afghanistan for good. This urgency prompted British and Afghan commanders to undertake another big heave during this summer's fighting season, co-ordinating three major operations in an attempt to drive the insurgents into sparsely populated desert areas where, it is hoped, they will struggle to mount meaningful attacks against the main towns.</p> <p>Two of these assignments have been in Nahr-e Saraj, where Afghan and British troops have pushed into badlands that have been a haven for the Taliban for nearly 20 years, and even longer for the narco-gangs they are often aligned with.</p> <p>British commanders say this is the main reason why casualties have been so high: because the fight is being taken to the insurgents, not the other way around.</p> <p>But despite having overwhelming military superiority, these gains are gradual and sometimes come at a terrible cost. Whether the areas can be held in the long term is a question nobody can answer.</p> <p>One British officer involved in both operations in Nahr-e Saraj conceded he was surprised by the insurgents' resilience. \"I am constantly amazed by them,\" he said. \"They are completely over-matched by us and the Afghan army. We keep killing them, but they keep coming back for more.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396450359\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/20/1348151896258/Afghanistan-map-of-Nahr-e-001.png\" alt=\"Afghanistan map of Nahr-e Saraj\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nahr-e Saraj, a haven for the Taliban for nearly 20 years. Credit: Guardian graphics</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unable to fight face to face, the insurgents have been attempting to derail the clearance strategy with a mix of roadside bombs and sniper fire. But another tactic has proved much more successful. Their ability to \"turn\" members of the Afghan security forces to attack Isaf soldiers prompted Nato's hasty decision to reduce some joint patrols with Afghan troops. The so-called green on blue killings have not all been engineered by the insurgents, but they now know how to hurt the western alliance \u2013 and will try harder.</p> <p>For the British, one of the main aims of Operation Qalb is to reinforce security around Gereshk, the busy town that accounts for more than half of the people in Nahr-e Saraj. Having driven the insurgents out of Gereshk, street by street, building by building, this is one of the military's showpiece legacies.</p> <p>The bazaar here used to look like a bomb had hit it, or several probably. Now that it is vibrant and comparatively calm, business has begun to take root. In the last two years, 500 shops have been built in the town, and all have been bought.</p> <p>Talking to Afghans who live there, it is obvious they are grateful for being in the security bubble. They also admit feeling apprehensive about what will happen when Isaf leaves.</p> <p>Bahlool Khan, who has just been re-elected as chair of the Gereshk local council, said: \"In the past there was a lot of fighting. There was a lot of bloodshed and people were killing each other. There was no education, no health. People were hiding behind walls. Nobody trusts the insurgents. People have not forgotten.\"</p> <p>One woman living in Gereshk added: \"The women living here are quite happy to have Isaf around. The girls are going to school again. We don't want the old tribal wars to come back. It has become more peaceful, especially in the bazaar. We don't want to go back to the Taliban days when Isaf goes.\"</p> <p>The best way to protect them, Afghan and Nato commanders have decided, is to push the insurgents further away from the town, deeper into Helmand.</p> <p>The Afghan army has taken the lead in the two most recent operations, supported by Danish and British forces, including the Grenadier Guards, who are stationed at Main Operating Base Price, a short drive from Gereshk.</p> <p>The tactic is simple, but requires feats of co-ordination to get right.</p> <p>On Monday and Tuesday nights last week, 1,200 Afghan troops from the 3rd Kandak (battalion), along with 200 British soldiers and advisers, left their neighbouring camps to take up discreet positions in the insurgent-filled region of Pulpazay.Forming a steel ring around villages and compounds, the Afghan National Army (ANA) began a series of house to house searches, gradually sweeping its way through the area, flushing out insurgents. Commanders who have been on previous operations say few insurgents stand and fight, and those who try do not come out alive.</p> <p>The ones who run are caught in the net around the village and are handed over to the police. All the details of this latest operation have not been disclosed yet because it is not over. But the early days of the mission suggest at least some success. Forty-four improvised explosive devices were discovered, as well as \"a significant weapons cache, radio equipment and hundreds of rounds of ammunition\".</p> <p>It will be another week before this mission finishes, by which time the ANA hopes to have built permanent checkpoints to deter the insurgents from coming back again. Locally elected councillors have been preaching there too, offering modest gestures \u2013 such as repairing a roof or well \u2013 to help persuade those who might be sceptical about whether their \"liberation\" will last, or do them any good.</p> <p>The facts that the ANA is taking the lead in these exercises and that Nahr-e Saraj has elected officials are regarded by the British as a measure of the progress that has been made in this district over the last three years. But can the Afghan army, which has basic equipment and is still evolving as a fighting force, continue to protect the safer areas, let alone take on the insurgents in places where the Taliban appear to remain strong?</p> <p>British commanders believe they can do the former but are more hesitant about the latter. \"Last year there was violence inside populated areas; this year, the violence is still at the same level, but it has been displaced,\" said Brigadier Doug Chalmers, commander of Task Force Helmand.</p> <p>\"Everyone talks about Nahr-e Saraj as if it is toxic. There is a northern part of the district that has a lot of insurgency activity inside rural villages. But the actual city of Gereshk is growing. It is not a city under siege, otherwise it would be withering. Gereshk gives me confidence we are providing the environment for the Afghans to regain a bit of control.</p> <p>\"If people weren't bothering to invest, I would be nervous that what we are doing here might be a bit transitory. But if you go there, it is a bustling regional town. How much better could it be? External investors are oblivious to the violence.\"</p> <p>There are big caveats, as Chalmers acknowledges. \"Is it going to continue to move forward? I think it will, but I can't guarantee that it will. Will there be the same level of change that we have seen over the last two years? The answer is, I am not sure there will be. The Afghans will do things differently, and as they take responsibility, it will change the dynamic in a way that we don't really know yet.\"</p> <p>Chalmers said it may be more important to the Afghan security forces to hold what they already have. \"The fact that there may still be an insurgency when we have gone, is that going to affect the city of Gereshk, or will Afghans be prepared to tolerate that? My feeling is that they are slightly more pragmatic than the west. They know what matters.\"</p> <p>The local security forces were already reaching out to the insurgents, he said, and local accommodations and agreements could follow. This could lead to deals that leave the Afghan government in control of some areas, and the Taliban free to live in others.</p> <p>That is not what the UK had once hoped for, but it might be Helmand's best hope now. \"Our job is to enable the Afghans to enter the conversation from a position of strength,\" said Chalmers. \"It is very difficult to have those conversations with people if you are the weakling in the room. And it is very difficult for us as genuine outsiders to do that level of negotiation. A lot of it is quite local, village to village. It is very difficult for us to do, and I don't think it is right for us to do.\"</p> <p>Chalmers admitted anxiety about relinquishing all control to the Afghans, as Nato is gradually doing as part of its withdrawal strategy. He likened it to a parent watching a child going to university, and becoming truly independent. \"I have to force myself to accept that the only way for this to work is to let go.\"</p> <p>General Adrian Bradshaw, commander of British forces in Afghanistan, and deputy to Isaf 's commander, General John Allen,said the high levels of violence this year in places such as Nahr-e Saraj were symptomatic of something else. He believes the Taliban are pushing back as hard as they can because their leaders are preparing to enter the political and reconciliation process.</p> <p>\"What we would expect from an insurgency entering the political arena is to seek to maximise the bargaining position. It is often suggested that the Taliban will simply wait us out until 2015 and scale down their effort, and what we are seeing now does not represent the maximum effort. I don't think that is credible at all.</p> <p>\"What they will be doing now, and what they have been doing all of this summer, is absolutely maximising their effort to full capacity because they have to maximise their bargaining position when entering the negotiating arena. All the indications we get from intelligence suggest there is a real push on their junior commanders, from their senior commanders sitting outside the country, to keep up the fight.\"</p> <p>Bradshaw said he believed the Taliban had been struggling with funding because they made no money out of opium poppies last year. The insurgents were also short of weapons, he added. \"[They] are now coming to the realisation that keeping on and keeping on, pounding themselves against us and our Afghan partners, is not delivering. This is the beginning of an understanding by their higher command that they have to find an alternative approach. And there are signs that some of them are looking to do just that. We are seeing it to a certain degree at all levels. We see signs from mid-level fighters of dissatisfaction.</p> <p>\"Some of them leave the organisation and weare aware that at higher level there also people interested in a political path, or at least concluding that they will not achieve their political ends by military means alone.\" However, Bradshaw admitted it would be wrong to suggest the insurgency was in any way spent. \"I don't want to paint too rosy a picture of the situation. The fact remains that the insurgency is still a significant threat to peace and stability.\"</p> <p>And nowhere more so than in Nahr-e Saraj. The area has always been a hotbed of tribal and gang rivalry, quite separate from the insurgency. The assassination of a government official in the district last week was not claimed by the Taliban. That kind of murder is not uncommon in Helmand; such attacks happened before UK troops arrived, and they will continue once they have gone. British commanders accept that and understand better than perhaps ever before that their forces have probably done as much as they can, or were ever likely to be able to do, in a society as complex and feudal as Afghanistan. Now it is up to the Afghans themselves.</p> <p>One of the men who will have most responsibility for the security of Nahr-e Saraj in the coming years is Colonel Hamayoon, the 36-year-old commander of the ANA's 3rd Kandak. The officer has been working with the British over the last two years, and says he has learned a great deal from them. Like all commanders in every military, he wants better equipment and more of it. But there is a greater need: he wants to go it alone, without Isaf.</p> <p>\"This is our country and our people, and it is our obligation to take responsibility for their safety. There will be peace. The only question is when.\"</p>",

Used to guiding stars and teasing performances out of them, Hurll adopted a different approach with Barker, who exercised firm control over the programme. \"My basis was, 'He knows all about comedy', and what you did was what Ronnie B wanted. You just agreed and he was always right.\"</p> <p>In 1990 Hurll devised for ITV <a href=\"http://www.britishcomedyawards.com/history.aspx\" title=\"the British Comedy Awards\">the British Comedy awards</a>, a ceremony recognising talent on stage, screen and radio. The awards became a permanent fixture on television and recently switched to Channel 4. Many of the annual shows have been screened live, presenting no technical problems to&#xa0;a man steeped in live television but resulting in some memorable moments that his BBC employers might have balked at. Julian Clary joking onstage about \"fisting Norman Lamont\" at the 1993 ceremony was one example of&#xa0;how&#xa0;the show pushed the boundaries. Jonathan Ross, as the presenter, also proved unpredictable with his sharp-tongued wit and there was panic in 2006 when a snake brought on to the stage by&#xa0;Nigel Marven tried to escape.</p> <p>Hurll was born in London and attended St Paul's school, in&#xa0;the south-west of the city, where he directed Jonathan Miller, a&#xa0;fellow pupil, in a revue. On leaving school, he worked behind the scenes in the theatre. In the mid-1950s, he joined the BBC as a \"call boy\" and ushered in the guests for <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1261637/index.html\" title=\"The Billy Cotton Band Show\">The&#xa0;Billy Cotton Band Show</a>. He progressed to stage manager before directing the programme.</p> <p>Other shows produced by Hurll during an era when variety was popular on television included The Illustrated Weekly Hudd (1967), Cilla (1968-76), A Christmas Night with the Stars (1972), Seaside Special (1975-79) and Ronnie Corbett's Saturday Special (1977). He also directed the Royal Variety Performance and, in 1974, the Eurovision Song Contest, which was <a href=\"http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=290\" title=\"1974 Eurovision Song Contest\">won by Abba with Waterloo</a>.</p> <p>In later years, Hurll was not always complimentary about the shows he made, describing some as \"terrible rubbish\". He also had firm views about stars such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/29/guardianobituaries.film\" title=\"\">Bob Hope </a>(\"the nastiest man I've ever worked with\") and Rod&#xa0;Hull (\"the most miserable man you&#xa0;ever met\").</p> <p>Hurll produced and directed the live Saturday evening entertainment programme The Late Late Breakfast Show (1982-86), presented by Noel Edmonds. However, the series was axed after a hod-carrier who was a volunteer on the programme died when he fell 120ft while rehearsing for a stunt that involved bungee jumping from a metal box suspended from a crane.</p> <p>After turning freelance, Hurll teamed up again with Black and was executive producer of Blind Date and two Surprise Surprise specials. He also made other programmes for LWT, including Schofield's Quest (1994-95), and in 1994, his own company, Michael Hurll Television, took over production of the British Comedy awards from LWT. The business linked up with Edmonds' Unique Communications Group in 1997 to make entertainment specials such as Lights, Camera, Magic (2002).</p> <p>With Edmonds presenting, the arrangement also yielded Noel's Christmas Presents (1998) and The World of the Secret Camera (1999). The&#xa0;partnership ended in 2008 when Hurll joined Summer Films as&#xa0;a&#xa0;consultant and co-producer.</p> <p>In 2000 Hurll's son Jeremy, also a&#xa0;television producer, died of a brain haemorrhage. He is survived by his wife, Sandra, whom he married in 1964, and their son Simon.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael Hurll, television producer and&#xa0;director, born 7 October 1936; died&#xa0;18&#xa0;September 2012</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 September 2012. It had located St Paul's school in Barnes, but until 1968 the school was in Hammersmith, also in south-west London. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> You wait two years for something and it's over in three days. Enough about your latest doomed relationship; I'm referring to Zimbabwe's World T20 campaign. <strike> If </strike> When they lose today they will exit the tournament before most teams have played their first game. Mind you, Zimbabwe did beat South Africa the last time these two sides met in a global tournament \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65218.html\">a match those with English cricket close to their heart/funnybone will remember well</a>. Zimbabwe could win today, but <a href=\"http://www.oddschecker.com/cricket/international/twenty20-world-cup/south-africa-v-zimbabwe/winner\">South Africa's odds of 1/20 </a>look about right.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>South Africa have won the toss</strong> and will bowl first.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Levi, Amla, Kallis, de Villiers (c/wk), Duminy, Behardien, A Morkel, Botha, Peterson, Steyn, M Morkel.</p> <p><strong>Zimbabwe</strong> Masakadza, Sibanda, Taylor (c/wk), Ervine, Matsikenyeri, Chigumbura, Cremer, Utseya, Price, Mpofu, Vitori.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>1st over: Zimbabwe 1-0 (Masakadza 1, Sibanda 0)</strong> The ground is almost empty. It's a bit eerie, especially with cheesy beatdisco nonsense pumping out as the openers walk to the wicket. Hamilton Masakadza offers no stroke to the first four balls of the match, from Dale Steyn, and then steals a single to extra cover. Vusi Sibanda also leaves his first delivery. There can't be too many T20 overs in which five of the six balls were ignored by the batsmen.</p> <p>\"Seeing as how SA have won the toss and will bowl, what are the odds on the match being over before I have to go out at 4.45pm?\" says Clare Davies. \"I'm thinking it's possible but maybe I am being unkind to Zimbabwe.\" It shouldn't be over <em>that</em> quickly, although it may be finished in time for Pointless.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 2-1 (Sibanda b M Morkel 0)</strong> Well that didn't take long. Morne Morkel castles Vusi Sibanda for nought with a fine delivery: full and seaming back through the gate to trim the bails as Sibanda went for a big drive.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Zimbabwe 3-1 (Masakadza 2, Taylor 1)</strong> The new batsman is the captain Brendan Taylor, who avoids a tournament king pair after his first-baller the other night. There is good carry in this pitch, especially for an Asian wicket, and Masakadza is beaten on the pull to conclude the over.</p> <p>\"Hi Rob, I am out here,\" says Louwrens Botha. \"I've never heard of Behardien but the fact that Faf du Plessis is finally out of the team fills me with confidence. Not much faith in Levi though, I think it's the regular giants (Kallis, Amla and AB) who'll have to produce for SA today and throughout the tournament.\" Albie Morkel gives them good depth at No7, but there are some potential weak links in the top six for sure.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Zimbabwe 4-1 (Masakadza 2, Taylor 2)</strong> Masakadza misses a windy woof at a lovely outswinger from Dale Steyn. This may be a straightforward game for South Africa, in theory, but Dale Steyn has his gameface on. And wise men don't argue with Dale Steyn's gameface. Masakadza is beaten again by some extra bounce later in the over. Zimbabwe are rattling along at 1.33 runs per over; their projected 20-over score is 27.</p> <p>\"Afternoon Smyth, afternoon everybody,\" says Josh Robinson. \"If you're short on emails, you might like to check your spam folder. That must be where mine are ending up, because I'm unable to think of any other plausible explanation why you would have neglected to publish them.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 6-2 (Taylor c de Villiers b M Morkel 4)</strong> Two wickets in two overs for Morne Morkel. This time he takes the key wicket of the captain Brendan Taylor. It was an ugly dismissal. Taylor reached with a horizontal bat for a very wide delivery that took the bottom edge on its way through to AB de Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4th over: Zimbabwe 11-2 (Masakadza 6, Ervine 1)</strong> A boundary! Masakadza blasts a full delivery from Morkel down the ground for the first four of the innings.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 16-3 (Masakadza c Levi b A Morkel 6)</strong> Albie Morkel strikes with his fourth ball. Masakadza, charging down the track with all the conviction of Blackadder going over the top, lifted Morkel high in the air to mid on. This is far too easy for South Africa.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5th over: Zimbabwe 17-3 (Ervine 6, Matsikenyeri 0)</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>mismatch [\u02ccm\u026as\u02c8m\u00e6t\u0283]</strong><br><em>vb</em> to match badly, esp in marriage<br><em>n</em> a bad or inappropriate match</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6th over: Zimbabwe 21-3 (Ervine 8, Matsikenyeri 2)</strong> Four singles from Morne Morkel's third over.</p> <p>\"We have bigger crowds watching warm-ups on the maidan where I live here in a village in the Himalayas,\" says Prakash Anand. \"What happens if Sri Lanka don't make the semi-finals? Will this be the most underattended 'world' sporting tournament ever?\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7th over: Zimbabwe 26-3 (Ervine 11, Matsikenyeri 4)</strong> The offspinner Johan Botha comes into the attack; his first over yields five. Zimbabwe are regrouping solidly, and if they keep wickets in hand for overs 41-50 they could post a competitive score.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8th over: Zimbabwe 34-3 (Ervine 16, Matsikenyeri 7)</strong> Craig Ervine gets his second boundary with an excellent reverse sweep off the new bowler Robin Peterson. Ervine has played nicely so far.</p> <p>\"I don't understand the format (but then again I don't understand much),\" says Charles Evison. \"How come Zimbabwe is playing their second game and are in danger of being dumped out the tournament before England have even played a game?\" It's unavoidable if you have groups of three, because the second match in each group will always involve one side playing their second game and one side playing their first game, so when the second game in Group A is played, one team in Groups B, C and D won't have played their first game. Confused? Splendid, now lie down on the couch and talk to me about Oedipus.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9th over: Zimbabwe 43-3 (Ervine 21, Matsikenyeri 9)</strong> Another fine stroke from Ervine, an inside-out drive to the cover boundary off Botha. Two balls later Matsikenyeri is hit on the pad by an almost yorker-length delivery and survives a huge LBW appeal. I suspect it was turning down the leg side. Nine from the over. This has been a good, purposeful partnership.</p> <p>\"I am so disheartened that this contest (debatable description!) is already over that I may consider bidding on one of those awful specially minted ICC coins they use for the toss...\" says Jim Lewis. \"The minnows have been slightly disappointing so far, particularly their fielding, although I have a sneaky feeling England will make Afghanistan look like world beaters tomorrow.\" If they find a way to play Finn and Broad \u2013 which is a huge if, I realise \u2013 they could win that game.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>10th over: Zimbabwe 51-3 (Ervine 25, Matsikenyeri 11)</strong> <br>\"Today may be a m\u026as\u02c8m\u00e6t\u0283, but I have hope for the future,\" says Patrick Kingsley. \"In the latest version of International Cricket Captain, now thankfully available for Mac, the year is 2033, I am the captain of Zimbabwe, and we are number one in all three formats of the game. We've won every single World Cup and World T20 for the past 20 years. Our secret weapon? <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/player/235524.html\">Timycen Maruma</a>, who is Zim's record wicket-taker in my alternative universe. Sadly he's not in the real-life squad. But maybe he should be.\"</p> <p>One good thing about playing management games into the 2030s is that you sometimes get made-up names based on a mix of current player names. I wouldn't fancy coming up against Sir Garfield Botham or Malcolm Holding, although I suppose I'd fancy my chances against Chris Salisbury and Patterson Mahmood.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 51-4 (Matsinkenyeri c Peterson b Kallis 11)</strong> Jacques Kallis takes his 47410895th international wicket in his first over. Matsikenyeri, on the walk, clobbered a short ball straight to Peterson at extra cover.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 51-5 (Chigumbura LBW b Kallis 0)</strong> Make that 47410896 international wickets. Kallis has struck with consecutive deliveries. Elton Chigumbura got in a terrible mess with a very full delivery that hit him right in front of middle. A blindfolder man could have given that out, and Kallis on a hat-trick.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>11th over: Zimbabwe 51-5 (Ervine 25, Cremer 0)</strong> Cremer survives the hat-trick ball. Jacques Kallis has bog-standard Twenty20 figures: 1-1-0-2.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>12th over: Zimbabwe 57-5 (Ervine 28, Cremer 3)</strong> Six from Albie Morkel's over. \"Afternoon Rob,\" says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \"I normally only come here for nostalgia, and this occasion is no different. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/player/55528.html\">Remember Neil Johnson</a>? He was a beast and a genuine all-rounder as well as a part time wickie(?). His profile photo is hardly flattering but at least it was before the hair went. I definitely saw him play for a world XI at the Oval once, but it doesnt seem to be on Cricinfo.\" He was a fine player and made that lovely hundred against Australia at Lord's during the 1999 World Cup. Zimbabwe had a really good team around then, surely their best.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>13th over: Zimbabwe 58-5 (Ervine 28, Cremer 4)</strong> Steyn returns to the attack in pursuit of some free candy. Cremer survives an extremely tight run-out referral after being sent back by Ervine. Steyn concludes a lively over by dumping Ervine on his derriere with an excellent short ball.</p> <p>\"The brass music is a bit average but the drumming isn't bad,\" says John Starbuck. \"Do we know who's playing?\" I think it's Reni although it could be the bloke from Heavy Stereo.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 60-6 (Cremer c de Villiers b Kallis 6)</strong> A third wicket for big Jacques. He just has too much nous and too much bounce for the Zimbabweans. Cremer, trying to pull, gloved a short one down the leg side to de Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>14th over: Zimbabwe 61-6 (Ervine 28, Utseya 1)</strong> The new batsman is Prosper Utseya, the scourge of Stick Cricket addicts throughout 2005. Jacques Kallis has bog-standard Twenty20 figures: 2-1-3-3.</p> <p>\"One of my batsman's called Adriaanus Benkenstein, who's clearly channelling South Africa's Dale Benkenstein,\" says Patrick Kingsley. \"Big difference, though. Dale never played a Test. Adriaanus averages 70 from 87.\" Pah. He's go nothing on Sir Donald <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/51874.html\">Ganteaume</a>.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>15th over: Zimbabwe 65-6 (Ervine 29, Utseya 2)</strong> Morne Morkel finishes with figures of 4-0-16-2. I've seen worse.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>16th over: Zimbabwe 69-6 (Ervine 31, Utseya 4)</strong> Four from Johan Botha's third over. Pulitzer please!</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 75-7 (Utseya c de Villiers b Steyn 5)</strong> AB de Villiers takes a stunning catch to give Dale Steyn his first wicket of the innings. Utseya fenced a short ball down the leg side, and de Villiers moved sharply to his left before diving full length to take a one-handed catch just above the turf.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>17th over: Zimbabwe 75-7 (Ervine 36, Price 0)</strong> Steyn ends with figures of 4-0-9-1. \"Following this summer's Olympics, and the amazing spectacle that was the Tour de France/Vuelta a Espagna, I've been kind of taking it for granted that if I like it, it'll probably be on TV, but I can't seem to find the T20 anywhere,\" says Mark Taylor. \"Is it digital or nothing for this one?\" Yep, every game is on Sky Sports. I don't think there are terrestrial highlights, though I'm not certain.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 77-8 (Ervine c de Villiers b Kallis 37)</strong> Jacques Kallis has four wickets for five runs. Ervine tried to steer a short one to third man but it got big on him and went straight through to AB de Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>18th over: Zimbabwe 80-8 (Price 1, Jarvis 3)</strong> Jacques Kallis has bog-standard Twenty20 figures: 3-1-8-4.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>19th over: Zimbabwe 86-8 (Price 3, Jarvis 6)</strong></p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>20th over: Zimbabwe 93-8 (Price 7, Jarvis 9)</strong> Ray Price hits the last ball of the innings for four, so Jacques Kallis fails to add a Twenty20 five-for to his glittering CV. What a miserable failure he is. He ends with figures of 4-1-15-4, and South Africa need <strong>94</strong> to win the match and eliminate Zimbabwe. See you in 10 minutes for their reply.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 15-0 (target 94; Levi 1, Amla 8)</strong> Kyle Jarvis's first over disappears for 15! Six of those are extras, with four leg-byes followed by couple of wides. Amla gets off the mark by flashing a slower ball to the extra-cover boundary, and he uppercuts another four off the final delivery.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 24-0 (target 94; Levi 8, Amla 9)</strong> We're having a few technical problems I'm afraid. Richard Levi has a few technical issues, but they don't seem too concern him too much. He drags a pull off the left-arm seamer Vitori round the corner for four. Amla and Levi might be the definitive beauty-and-the-beast opening partnership.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 31-0 (target 94; Levi 10, Amla 11)</strong> Ray Price, Zimbabwe's ageing left-arm spinner, comes into the attack. His last ball beats everybody, just bouncing over the stumps for three byes.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 38-0 (target 94; Levi 15, Amla 12)</strong> A good over from Kyle Jarvis \u2013 just three from the first five balls \u2013 is soiled when Levi boom-booms him over mid-on for a one-bounce four.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 44-0 (target 94; Levi 15, Amla 17)</strong> Hashim Amla opens his legs and shows his class, easing back in the crease to lash Price through the covers for four. South Africa are just fractionally ahead of the required rate.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 56-0 (target 94; Levi 27, Amla 18)</strong> Richard Levi hits a lovely boundary <em>on the off side</em>, flashing Vitori through the covers on the up. He repeats the dose off the final ball of the over. South Africa required 38 from 84 balls. The CH- word wouldn't begin to do things justice were they to lose this.</p> <p>\"Pointless is starting now,\" says Simon McMahon. \"Should be over in time for Eggheads, though.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 60-0 (target 94; Levi 29, Amla 20)</strong> Prosper Utseya is coming into the attack to bowl some offspin. Were this Stick Cricket in 2005 he would win the match from here. I can't have been the only one to have Utseya go through my team like a dose of salts? Anyway, his first over is a good one that goes for four.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 64-0 (target 94; Levi 31, Amla 22)</strong> The legspinner Graeme Cremer is fiddled around for four singles.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 73-0 (target 94; Levi 38, Amla 24)</strong> Levi slams a flighted delivery from Utseya over midwicket for a one-bounce four. Not long now. Hang in there.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 79-0 (target 94; Levi 42, Amla 26)</strong> <a href=\"http://www.marmite.co.uk/restaurant/menu.html\">You can download and print off the recipes for later using the link on the left. Marmite Bloody Mary anyone? Don't say we didn't warn you!</a></p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 88-0 (target 94; Levi 47, Amla 29)</strong> Marmite beef fillet with a chasseur ragout? Really?</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 91-0 (target 94: Levi 49, Amla 30)</strong> Amla is dropped by Sibanda, a hot chance at backward point off the bowling of Jarvis.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 94-0 (Levi 50, Amla 32). SOUTH AFRICA WIN BY 10 WICKETS WITH 44 BALLS TO SPARE</strong> Levi reaches a strong 44-ball half century, and then Amla finishes the mismatch with a single down the ground. Zimbabwe are out; South Africa are through the second group stage. Thanks for your emails; night.</p>",
  "<p>Muslim civil rights groups and community organisations have condemned a series of anti-Islamic advertisements that will be appearing in New York's subway stations next week.</p> <p>The ads had initially been rejected by the city's Metropolitan Transport Authority (MTA) but were later allowed after a legal appeal ruled them to be expressions of freedom of speech. One ad reads: \"In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat jihad.\"</p> <p>The ads are set to appear in at least 10 of the city's 400 subways stations and have been designed and paid for by the controversial American Freedom Defence Initiative, which is led by outspoken anti-Islamist activist Pamela Geller. The AFDI has been termed an \"active anti-Muslim group\" by the civil rights watch dog organisation the Southern Poverty Law Centre.</p> <p>\"You are talking about people like me being called a \"savage\",\" said Linda Sarsour, the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York. \"It is all bubbling up. I know there is freedom of speech, but with freedom of speech comes responsibility. This promotes hate.\"</p> <p>The AFDI first came to prominence during a prolonged fight about the building of an Islamic cultural centre in downtown Manhattan. Its critics dubbed the project a \"Ground Zero mosque\" and waged a high-profile campaign against it that many said was Islamaphobic. The SPLC termed Geller \"the anti-Muslim movement's most visible and flamboyant figurehead.\"</p> <p>Ads similar to the ones set to appear in New York have already been put on buses in San Francisco. However, the local transport authority in the city, known as Muni, donated the funds raised by the ad to the city's Human Rights Commission and also ran their own ad next to it that stated: \"Muni doesn't support this message.\" The AFDI has also sought to run the ads in Washington DC but authorities there have delayed them for public safety concerns.</p> <p>Muslim civil rights groups said the ads were coming at an especially sensitive time as world politics are already being rocked by violent protests and attacks on American embassies in the wake of the production of an anti-Islamic film made by an Egyptian Coptic Christian living in California. It also comes after several high-profile incidents in the US, including the burning of a mosque in Joplin, Missouri. \"They add to the overall picture of anti-Muslim feeling that is growing up in our nation,\" said Ibrahim Hooper, a director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations.</p> <p>The renewed controversy over the ads also comes on the same day as a major global report by the Pew Research Centre identified a rise of religious intolerance worldwide, including in the US. On the two measures the survey used \u2013 called \"social hostility\" and \"government restrictions\" - the US moved up the scale for the first time in both areas. When it came to official restrictions the US went from a low category to moderate, but when it came to the social hostilities index the country went from the lower end of the moderate scale to the upper end.</p>",
  "<p>Attempts to seek and dig up the remains of thousands of victims of Francoist death squads in the Spanish civil war have run into trouble after a court refused to take charge of the search for the bones of poet and playwright Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and others killed alongside him.</p> <p>A court in Granada, southern Spain, has ruled it is not competent to search for the remains of Garc\u00eda Lorca and three other men whose bodies were thrown into an unidentified grave somewhere in the hills overlooking the city.</p> <p>A local judge ruled that a 1977 amnesty law would prevent those responsible for murdering the author of Blood Wedding from being tried, while a statute of limitations meant too much time had gone by for the crime to be formally investigated.</p> <p>The decision was a further blow to Spain's historical memory campaigners, who have been seeking help from the courts as they continue a decade-long campaign to dig up Francoist victims and return remains to their families.</p> <p>Along with similar recent decisions by other courts, it also helped close the door to the naming or prosecution of those who committed crimes against humanity during the Spanish civil war and in the repression that followed during the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco.</p> <p>The court decisions stem directly from a ruling in which crusading magistrate Baltasar Garz\u00f3n was reprimanded by the country's supreme court for investigating crimes committed by Franco's fascist-backed rebels.</p> <p>In that case the court, which had already disbarred Garz\u00f3n for overstepping his powers while investigating corruption in prime minister Mariano Rajoy's People's party, ruled that he had been wrong to open an investigation into the deaths of 114,000 Francoist victims.</p> <p>The supreme court also rejected Garz\u00f3n's argument that, where people had simply been \"disappeared\", a crime of continuous kidnapping was still being carried out which was not covered by either the amnesty law or a statute of limitations.</p> <p>Campaigners said they would appeal against the Granada court's decision, taking their fight to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg if necessary.</p> <p>Garc\u00eda Lorca's own family have opposed moves to dig up the grave where he is thought to lie alongside schoolteacher Di\u00f3scoro Galindo and anarchist bullfighters Francisco Galad\u00ed and Joaqu\u00edn Arcollas. But the other families are determined to find their relatives.</p> <p>\"We want to help those families whose relatives were thrown into roadside graves,\" said Rafael Gil Bracera of Granada's historical memory association.</p> <p>The alleged grave site, at the foot of an olive tree, was revealed to historians by a Spanish communist who claimed to have been forced to dig the grave as a 16-year-old.</p> <p>The regional government of Andalucia spent \u20ac70,000 (\u00a356,000) excavating the site in the hill town of Alfacar in 2009 \u2013 but no bones were found.</p> <p>A local historian, Miguel Caballero, says he will ask the courts to investigate reports that human bones and a crutch that may have belonged to Galindo had been found and reburied when the area was turned into a park bearing the poet's name in 1986.</p> <p>He wants the courts to quiz officials who allegedly knew that the bones had been reburied at a spot beside the park's gates.</p>",

Well, it's partly art, darling, and partly to highlight some scientific issues which may not engage little ones \u2013 though they could trigger a torrent of further questions \u2013 but are interesting for the rest of us. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396446423\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348157064919/jeans.jpg\" alt=\"tooth palace\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of the resin entrance to the palace, soon to be encrusted with milk teeth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here's what the festival organisers say:</p> <blockquote> <p>Palaces&#xa0;will be exhibited&#xa0;at the Manchester Science Festival and is&#xa0;one of several pieces in the exhibition, which aims to explore the issue of waste body parts, such as fat from liposuction or bones from joint replacements, and how these could be used for stem cell regeneration. As more people donate their teeth, the Palace will grow over time like a coral reef, to form a stalagmite-like structure of crystal resin, encrusted in barnacle formations using baby teeth donated by children in the UK and around the world.&#xa0;To donate your milk teeth <a href=\"http://palaces.org.uk/donate-your-tooth/\">go online here.</a></p> </blockquote> <p>As disposable body parts, milk teeth have particular potential for stem cell research. There is however, the knotty problem of the Tooth Fairy. Czarnecki has thought about this. She suggests:</p> <blockquote> <p>the Palace is a magical place for a child to see their milk teeth but to avoid destroying the fairy side of things, why not leave a token or a letter created by the child on their pillow for the tooth fairy to collect, which means they can still receive money but the tooth is left behind to donate to the Palace. </p> </blockquote> <p>She also wants to receive stories and drawings or find out what happens to children's milk teeth in different cultures. These will be part of a growing on line exhibition on the palace's website and some will form part of the exhibition as it tours nationally and overseas. As she says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Teeth are one of the parts of the body we lose naturally, and their loss is a sign of growth and development rather than decay. Different cultures have varying traditions about where these teeth go, and what they are used for and I am interested in looking at how waste body parts such as teeth could play a new role in our own science-based culture. Your tooth will be carefully looked after by our own tooth fairy until it is ready to be added to the Palace, along with the thousands of other milk teeth donated.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wish I had some to give. I have got my wisdom teeth in a box somewhere but they are hideous and large.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396446424\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/9/13/1347554322040/-climate-change-impact-on-004.jpg\" alt=\" climate change impact on food production : Dried sunflowers in Bulgaria\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Finished flowering?

  "<p>Gucci laid down a brightly coloured gauntlet on Wednesday as Milan fashion week cranked into gear and both Max Mara and Emporio Armani, both known for a more subdued approach, took up the challenge on the second day of shows in the Italian fashion capital.</p> <p>Last season, Max Mara, a label celebrated for quality outerwear showed an autumn/winter collection based around military coats. Next spring the label is instead plumping for a utility-safari look, albeit with a sportier twist. Hoods bobbed on the backs of blouses and blouson jackets to modern effect, while sleeves on tops or jackets were short and rolled up.</p> <p>Jumpsuits were presented as a daywear option even if the styling of wrapping the shoes' rope ties around their hems looked pretty tricky for anyone whose life doesn't involve posing for street-style photographers.</p> <p>If this was predominantly a commercial collection of separates, there were also some nice surprising touches thrown in. Patterned sweaters (perhaps a bit Marni in spirit) featured contrasting silk on the back, while a skirt front featuring mashed up leopard and Madras check panels turned to reveal a vivid floral pattern on the back. The chunky clog-style sandals also ticked the ankle-strap shoe trend box.</p> <p>Armani called his latest outing for the secondary Emporio line \"Neat\". He could also have called it \"Short\". Both the opening and closing series of outfits featured thigh-skimming shorts, playsuits and flippy skirt hemlines. It underlined the label's status as the youthful arm of the Armani brand.</p> <p>Black, white or nude were spliced together on tops to create a graphic effect as the show began. But this collection seemed largely about exploring clothes and shoes with a touch of the metallic about them. Metallic shorts and sleeveless jacket sets gave off a contemporary cocktail girl-about-town vibe. Flat pumps and high-heel sandals both featured a metallic toecap and ankle strap detail.</p> <p>Ankle strap sandals have emerged as the key style of shoe for next season \u2013 from Topshop in London to Gucci in Milan. The influential French fashion editor Carine Roitfeld has long been a fan of this style and was seen front row in Milan on Thursday wearing a pair of ribbon tie black sandals with a pair of black trousers.</p> <p>Armani also included signature soft masculine-feminine trouser suiting in neutrals. His trouser shape for next season is looser through the thigh and becomes more tapered at the ankle.</p> <p>Earlier this month the brand, which is 31 years old and has 225 stores globally, opened a new flagship store on New York's Madison Avenue. There are also plans to double its number of stores in the US by the end of this year.</p> <p>The label is also the first to team up with digital music service Spotify, creating an official account and branded playlist, which allows users to subscribe to the Armani account and stream tracks for free. This is a canny way to tap into a younger, technology driven audience in the same way Burberry and Topshop have done with Facebook.</p> <p>Trade magazine Women's Wear Daily reported this month that Emporio Armani accounted for 27% of the Armani Group's overall revenues last year of \u20ac1.8bn (\u00a31.4bn).</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of miners went back to work at the Marikana mine in South Africa on Thursday, ending a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/18/strike-south-africa-miners-deal-lonmin\" title=\"\">six-week strike</a> in which 46 people died.

  "<p>A loaf of bread which was put in the oven in AD79 and removed from it in the 1930s, and a charred baby's cradle which still rocks almost 2,000 years after its owner died, are some of the objects coming to <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/pompeii_and_herculaneum.aspx\" title=\"\">the British Museum this spring</a> for its exhibition on one of the most famous disasters in history: the eruption of Vesuvius.</p> <p>As well as the objects which surrounded them in life, there will be casts made from the bodies of those who died in 79AD, when the monstrous eruption blew off the entire top of the mountain and engulfed the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum.</p> <p>The six casts of those who died choking in the ash which fell like snow or were poisoned by noxious gases, include the most famous dog from the ancient world, frozen in time writhing against its collar and the rope which still tied it to a stake as it died. It was found just a few yards from an equally famous mosaic, which is also coming, originally guarding the threshold of a house in Pompeii, of a prancing red-collared black and white dog with the warning Cave Canem.</p> <p>Among thhe items coming to the exhibition are the remains of an entire family, two adults and two children, found cowering under a staircase in Pompeii. The casts were made in a technique invented in the 19th century to preserve the most moving testimony to the catastrophe by pouring plaster into the voids in the ash left as bodies decomposed, preserving the people as they fell \u2013 covering their heads, curled up like babies, or struggling to shelter a child.</p> <p>The two towns were different in life and death. Herculaneum was overwhelmed by a fiery pyroclastic flow hot enough to evaporate human flesh, so fast and furious that charred food remained on carbonised tables from meals that were never eaten. The town was buried 80 feet deep, and only a third of it has been excavated. Pompeii choked more slowly, and the tops of buildings were left sticking out of the ash field, so as early as Roman times people burrowed into the ruins for building materials and works of art.</p> <p>Pompeii was the larger and more racketty town, full of bars and brothels, Herculaneum wealthier and quieter. It was as if Brighton and Hove, had randomly remained as evidence of modern British culture, said British Museum director Neil MacGregor.</p> <p>Despite the display of bodies and the poignant objects the citizens snatched up as they tried to flee a collapsing cloud of ash and gas towering 19 miles into the sky above their heads, curator Paul Roberts, head of Roman collections at the museum, said the emphasis would be on everyday life in the towns, not death.</p> <p>Real faces of the living inhabitants will include an imposing bronze bust of a banker and money lender, who was also a freed slave as up to half the population may have been. A vivid wall painting portrays a baker, Terentius Neo, and his wife: his wife is nameless but, as MacGregor remarked, she looks much the brighter of the two, standing slightly in front of him and holding a writing tablet \u2013 striking evidence of her literacy and status.</p> <p>The exhibition comes after the international outcryfollowing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/07/pompeii-building-collapse-italian-government\" title=\"\">building collapses at Pompeii two years ago</a>, which led to some calling for the sites and collections to be removed from Italian state control.</p> <p>MacGregor and Roberts praised the relationship with the Italian authorities in charge of the museum in Naples and the two sites as a true collaboration: the Italians are charging no loan fees, and have allowed unprecedented access to treasures, including sending six pieces of Herculaneum furniture, when no more than two have ever left the country together. Roberts praised the \"outstanding work\" being done at the sites.</p> <p>The body casts, which include one woman who was cast in resin instead of plaster so that her bones are visible, will be shown in a separate section at the end. \"We recognise that for some people the idea of death will be the most challenging element of the exhibition, but we would prefer that people not avoid the bodies,\" Roberts said.</p> <p>He said he found some previous exhibitions of the casts distasteful, when they were shown in lurid lighting or with melodramatic music.</p> <p>\"These are real people, and we will treat them with the greatest respect. If these people had not died, we would not have this exhibition.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum, British Museum, 28 March - 29 September 2013.</p>",
  "<p>A drop in aid for the first time in many years and a rise in protectionist policies as a result of the global economic crisis risks slowing the momentum of significant development gains, a UN <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/mdg_gap/mdg_gap2012/mdg8report2012_engw.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> (pdf) warned on Thursday.</p> <p>Experts from a taskforce that tracks progress \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 on the millennium development goals (MDGs) said they found it difficult to identify areas of significant new progress on MDG8 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-global-partnership\" title=\"\">to develop a global partnership</a> \u2013 which focuses on what rich countries can and should do. They said for the first time there were signs of backsliding.</p> <p>The fall in official development assistance in 2011, after reaching a peak in 2010, represented the clearest sign of retrenchment. The volume of ODA from rich countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD/DAC) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/apr/04/value-oecd-aid-drops-15-years\" title=\"\">fell almost 3% to $133.5bn (around \u00a381bn) last year, equivalent to 0.31% of their aggregate gross national income (GNI)</a>.</p> <p>Out of 23 DAC donors, 16 cut their aid. The largest falls were seen in Greece and Spain as a direct result of the crisis, followed by Austria and Belgium, due to reduced debt forgiveness grants. Japanese aid also fell significantly after a big rise in 2010. Only Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark and the Netherlands still provided aid over and above the UN target of 0.7% of donor country GNI. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/11/government-un-overseas-aid\" title=\"\">Britain's new international development secretary, Justine Greening, has restated a commitment to meet the UN target by next year</a>, although the government has backed away from enshrining its election pledge into law.</p> <p>According to the MDG gap taskforce report, the Global Partnership for Development: Making Rhetoric a Reality, total ODA should more than double to $300bn, leaving a gap of $167bn. \"Growth of core ODA is expected to stagnate between 2013 and 2015, reflecting the delayed impact of the global economic crisis on donor country budgets,\" said the report, which argues that implementing international partnership commitments, particularly on aid, does not require substantial economic sacrifices in developed economies.</p> <p>The report expressed concern about the rise in protectionist trade policies and frustration with the stalled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/03/doha-round-trade-talks-explainer\" title=\"\">Doha round of trade negotiations, which have dragged out for 11 years</a>. Doha was supposed to bring greater opportunities for developing countries to gain from world trade. \"The current economic situation has lured governments back into using protectionist trade policies,\" said the taskforce. \"The implementation of new trade restrictions by Group of Twenty [G20] countries has not slowed down, and their increasing effects on global trade are now a cause for concern.\"</p> <p>More broadly, the report acknowledges a waning of support for the global partnership due to rich countries failing to honour their pledges. \"How many times and in how many forums can the member countries of WTO [World Trade Organisation] pledge to complete the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations without delivering on that pledge and still retain their credibility \u2026 How many times will multilateral conferences need to issue bland and non-committal outcome declarations to paper over deep divisions?\" said the report.</p> <p>The taskforce argues that international solidarity is still the compelling, moral case for partnership for development, as well as more pragmatic reasons. \"Rich people may try to live behind fortress walls in their countries and rich countries may try to erect fortress protections against the foreign poor. They would be all fooling themselves in our highly globalised world,\" the report warned.</p> <p>Some development experts, however, question whether the MDGs are behind the successes seen in poverty eradication. \"The goal of halving extreme poverty [measured by the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day] is likely to be achieved ahead of time, largely thanks to China's phenomenal growth,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/after-the-millennium-development-goals-by-dani-rodrik\" title=\"\">Professor Dani Rodrik at Harvard University's Kennedy school of government on the Project Syndicate blog</a>. \"At the same time, there is little evidence to suggest those successes were the result of the MDGs themselves. China implemented the policies that engineered history's greatest poverty eradication programme prior to, and independently from, the millennium declaration and the MDGs.\"</p> <p>Looking beyond the expiry of the MDGs in 2015, Rodrick argues for a new global compact focusing more directly on rich countries' responsibilities, as well as policies beyond aid and trade that have an equal, if not greater, impact on poor countries' development prospects.</p> <p>\"A short list of such policies would include: carbon taxes and other measures to ameliorate climate change; more work visas to allow larger temporary migration flows from poor countries; strict controls on arms sales to developing nations; reduced support for repressive regimes; and improved sharing of financial information to reduce money laundering and tax avoidance \u2026 Most of these measures are actually aimed at reducing damage \u2013 for example, climate change, military conflict and financial crime \u2013 that otherwise results from rich countries' conduct. 'Do no harm' is as good a principle here as it is in medicine.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi Tim! Is sex addiction <em>(1)</em> more common these days, or do we just hear&#xa0;more about it? </strong></p> <p>Hopefully we're evolving as a species. We don't have Vikings any more, invading countries and stealing the pretty women.</p> <p><strong>But sexually we may not have evolved that much.</strong></p> <p>I think we have less repression now. That's changed since I was a kid. There are places still where repressed people beat up homosexuals, but we certainly have evolved tremendously so far as the idea that women's sexuality is appropriate and a good thing. They used to perform hysterectomies on women who were sexual.</p> <p><strong>Is there a tendency towards oversharing?</strong></p> <p>I think we fetishise sexuality. It's kind of nauseating the use of it in selling products; and the sexualisation of children is an obscene tendency in the media. So yeah, it's complicated. I don't watch a lot of TV any more and I stay away from those kinds of pop culture magazines.</p> <p><strong>Because you find them repellent? </strong></p> <p>Because I find them redundant.</p> <p><strong>Was there any particular itch of your own you tapped into to play a&#xa0;sex&#xa0;addict?</strong></p> <p>I've been around addicts and I know the behaviour. And I know how much of a struggle it is for friends of mine. What I loved about the script [for Thanks for Sharing] was that it was able to look at a very serious issue with humour and great compassion. I think this film can help people. I think it can open the door to something that may be a forbidden topic. And whether that's sex addiction or alcoholism or obsessiveness with exercise, the first step towards healing is acknowledgment.</p> <p><strong>How would you compare the film with Shame&#xa0;<em>(2)</em>?</strong></p> <p>I haven't seen it.</p> <p><strong>It's pretty similar \u2026</strong></p> <p>Not as funny though, right? Someone asked that question last night <strong><em>(3)</em></strong> and I&#xa0;was like: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36198/shane\" title=\"\">Shane</a>? The western? <strong><em>(4)</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Do you think movies at the moment deny sex too much or over indulge it?</strong></p> <p>I don't see enough movies to be the guy to answer that. But I certainly think there's a tendency to be regressive and fearful. Some people want to live in the 21st century and some want to live in the 19th century.</p> <p><strong>Who's winning? </strong></p> <p>I guess we'll see in November. <strong><em>(5)</em></strong></p> <p><strong>You get all the best lines in the film. There's a cute one comparing feelings to children: you don't want to let them drive, but equally you don't want to stuff them in the boot. </strong></p> <p>There are so many little gems that are clearly mantras of people who have been through meetings. What that line is saying is you've got to not suppress feelings completely but be in control of them. It's the same with acting. You have to have full commitment to an intensity of emotion but you don't want it to be so hysterical you can't understand the words any more. We all have to figure out the balance in life. We can't let our ids control our behaviour.</p> <p><strong>How do you do that? </strong></p> <p>With full knowledge that if you let your id rule you'll probably wind up in jail.</p> <p><strong>It's quite a \"first-world problem\" film. </strong></p> <p>Yeah, but it's not one that's been dealt with a lot. It's not a rich person's problem either. I don't think I'd be in that movie. I totally agree that sometimes you find yourself 15 minutes in and think: this is a movie about rich white people and their problems. I&#xa0;get it. I don't want to participate in that sort of stuff.</p> <p><strong>You're known for your activism. How do you cope with life knowing about the troubles of others? How do you get through the day?</strong></p> <p>Oh, endlessly hopeful. Absolutely. We are so blessed to be living in a relatively safe world with access to great art. I think the thing that can bring you down is that idea of being connected to the world through your television. In Nineteen Eighty-Four Orwell writes about how people all participate in the two-minute hate where they stand in front of their telly screens and yell at the rebel leader. About three years ago I moved out to LA and into a new place and I didn't buy a television. When I was living in its absence I realised I had been participating in a two-hour hate every day. I'd been watching the news. And usually it was from my point of view, but I'd still be angry. You come out of that with a real distrust and dislike for the enemy. If you're watching Fox News your enemy is me, and if you're watching MSNBC then your enemy is the Republicans. So everyone is stirred into a frenzy, and in fact, when you go on the road and meet people in a bar and start talking to them, it don't matter. What matters is who you are, how you are in the present with the people you're with. <strong><em>(6)</em></strong> And I almost think it's serving a function to keep us divided.</p> <p><strong>Do you think it's the broadcasters' fault, or are they just catering for what people want? </strong></p> <p>I think it's what happens when you have to fill a lot of airtime.

  "<p>Britain and Russia are on a collision course over Alexander Litvinenko's death after a coroner said an inquest would be held early next year and would hear allegations that the spy was murdered by the Russian state.</p> <p>The coroner, Sir Robert Owen, said he regretted that it had taken so long to hold an inquest into Litvinenko's death nearly six years ago. \"There will be no further delay,\" he said. \"It's manifestly in the interests of his widow, Marina, and his son, Anatoly \u2026 of other interested persons and in the wider public interest, that [this] is brought to a conclusion.\"</p> <p>Litvinenko, a dissident and former Russian intelligence officer, died in November 2006 after ingesting polonium-210, a rare radioactive isotope. The Crown Prosecution Service has accused Andrei Lugovoi, a former KGB agent, of putting polonium in Litvinenko's tea during a meeting at London's Millennium Hotel. A second former KGB agent, Dmitry Kovtun, was also present at the meeting.</p> <p>At Thursday's hearing it emerged that the British authorities had formally accused Kovtun of Litvinenko's murder. Both accused men have denied involvement and claim they are victims themselves. In 2007, the Kremlin flatly refused a British request to extradite Lugovoi, leading to a row with Moscow and the tit-for-tat expulsion of Russian and British diplomats. Lugovoi is now a deputy in Russia's Duma.</p> <p>The Foreign Office had previously tried to limit the scope of the inquest, fearing further diplomatic fallout. But Owen said he endorsed a ruling by his predecessor in the case, Dr Andrew Reid, that there should be an \"open and fearless\" investigation. It would examine the theory that \"Russian state agents\" killed Litvinenko. A previously secret report by the Metropolitan police into the Litvinenko case, including vital forensic evidence, would be circulated early next month to \"interested parties\", he said.</p> <p>Ben Emmerson QC, acting for Marina Litvinenko, said she wanted the inquest to examine the \"alleged criminal role of the Russian state\". It should determine \"whether her husband's killing was a targeted assassination of a British citizen committed by agents of a foreign state in the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom\". If proved, this would be \"an act of state-sponsored nuclear terrorism on the streets of London\", he said.</p> <p>Marina Litvinenko said she was pleased there would finally be a full inquest. It is likely to take place in early 2013.</p> <p>\"We can't get a real trial and we can't get any justice. This [the inquest] will maybe give us some answers,\" she said.</p> <p>Alex Goldfarb, Litvinenko's close friend, said it was significant that the CPS had enough evidence to charge both Lugovoi and Kovtun. \"We have a group. We have a pre-organised plot. There are superiors,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The inquest will hopefully uncover what really happened,\" Goldfarb added. \"We and many others think this was a political murder perpetrated by the Russian state, possibly on the personal orders of Vladimir Putin. But there is no evidence for that. It's circumstantial. We don't know what is in the police file. We don't have the autopsy report. We don't know what the [British secret] services have. We know they were lurking in the background.\"</p> <p>The coroner said Scotland Yard had investigated whether Litvinenko, who fled from Russia to Britain in 2000, had been in contact with MI5 and MI6. He said the Yard's conclusions would remain secret at the request of the government.</p> <p>He ruled that the home secretary could be an \"interested party\" in the case. Other interested parties include Marina Litvinenko and her son; Litvinenko's first family, who live in Russia; the oligarch and Kremlin critic Boris Berezovsky; Lugovoi, Kovtun, the CPS and the Met.</p> <p>Louise Christian, Marina Litvinenko's solicitor, said she was optimistic that the judge's ruling on MI5 and MI6 could be challenged at a later stage and evidence from the intelligence services eventually revealed. Asked what the Met's report might contain, she said: \"I think it will confirm the forensic trail that links Lugovoi and Kovtun to the eventual murder. There was [polonium] contamination on three separate occasions.\"</p> <p>She added: \"We are extremely positive. We believe that British justice will be done.\"</p> <p>Ever since Litvinenko's murder, Russia has waged a concerted propaganda campaign to blame his killing on Berezovsky, Litvinenko's patron and the Kremlin's No 1 enemy. Lugovoi's spectacular political rise \u2013 he is a deputy with the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrat party \u2013 has fuelled speculation that he enjoys support from the top of Russian power. Lugovoi is likely to give evidence at the inquest via a video link from Moscow. He has hired a legal team.</p> <p>Despite his repeated protestations of innocence, British detectives are convinced the forensic trail leads back to Moscow. They say only a state or state organisation would have been in position to get hold of polonium, an extremely rare substance. US diplomatic cables reveal that Kovtun allegedly left traces of polonium across nothern Germany in the hours before he flew to London for his fateful meeting with Litvinenko. German police were said to have discovered polonium on Kovtun's rented BMW and the sofa where he slept.</p> <p>Privately, British diplomats admit that the inquest is likely to cause a fresh rift with Moscow and further infuriate Putin. David Cameron has been trying to improve bilateral relations, which were frosty under Labour. The prime minister visited Moscow last year, and Putin came to London in August to watch the Olympics. Russia's president remains furious at the UK's refusal to extradite Berezovsky and other exiles including the Chechen separatist leader Akhmad Zakayev, who attended Thursday's hearing.</p> <p>The next pre-inquest hearings will take place on 2 November and 13-14 December. The court has launched a new <a href=\"http://www.litvinenkoinquest.org\" title=\"\">website</a> with information about the case.</p>",
  "<p>The Pakistani army was drafted in to protect foreign embassies on Thursday after thousands of violent protesters clashed with police on the eve of an expected day of anti-western fury across the Islamic world.</p> <p>Dozens of people were wounded during vicious street fighting after masses of students, many carrying banners of hardline religious parties, attempted to converge on the diplomatic quarter in the heart of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.</p> <p>The outbreak of serious violence for the first time in the capital comes amid escalating tension, with protests held on consecutive days all around the country.</p> <p>On Thursday the rising threat prompted the US state department to harden its travel warning for American citizens, explicitly warning them against non-essential trips to Pakistan.</p> <p>Authorities in Islamabad had been making significant preparations for what many fear will be the most violent day of protests since controversy first flared around a YouTube video called Innocence of Muslims that ridicules Islam.</p> <p>In response the government declared Friday \"a day of love for the prophet\", a move which was welcomed by the Taliban and which risks substantially increasing the already high threat of violence on the traditional Islamic holy day.</p> <p>But the crowds of young men made short work of the various measures put in place, with protesters simply pushing to one side some of the huge metal sea containers that had been positioned to seal off sensitive areas of the capital, including the enclave.</p> <p>Police did manage to prevent crowds reaching the entrance to the diplomatic enclave, but that simply prompted them to fight on a nearby road, directly outside the Serena, Islamabad's grandest five-star hotel.</p> <p>Teargas canisters were lobbed back at police lines and into the grounds of the Serena, prompting police to fire live rounds into the air amid some unconfirmed reports that some demonstrators had been injured by gun shots.</p> <p>At one stage a group of police was surrounded on all sides by demonstrators and were pelted with stones. Protesters set fire to the few things available to them on the wide boulevards of Islamabad, including traffic cones and police checkposts.</p> <p>Rehman Baig, a posgraduate student, said the mission of the crowd was to reach the US embassy, a large complex deep inside the diplomatic enclave, and demand the dismissal of the ambassador.</p> <p>\"The infidels want to capture Muslim lands, defame Muslims and plunder our wealth,\" he said. He also demanded to know why the makers of Innocence of Muslims, have not been arrested.</p> <p>\"If they can find and kill Osama then why can't they catch this film-maker and punish him?\"</p> <p>Many demonstrators carried placards, including one saying: \"Obama we are all Osama\", and the flags of hardline religious parties, including the banner of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a group associated with banned terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. <strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>The iPhone 5 doesn't go on sale until Friday \u2013 but already rival Samsung says it will add it to a series of lawsuits over Apple equipment in the US, alleging that it infringes a series of patents.</p> <p>The South Korean company said in a US court filing that \"Samsung anticipates that it will file, in the near future, a motion to amend its infringement contentions to add the iPhone 5 as an accused product.\"</p> <p>The move is the latest in a continuing round of lawsuits between the two companies, which together control about half of the world's smartphone market. It comes after Apple booked orders for more than 2m of the new iPhone 5 in the first weekend.</p> <p>Samsung and Apple are locked in patent battle in 10 countries and the stakes are high as the two vie for top spot in the booming smartphone market. In late August Apple won a court battle in which it was awarded $1bn in damages against Samsung, which had been accused of infringing a number of software patents used on the iPhone, as well as its \"trade dress\" \u2013 the visual elements that make it unique. The jury in the case turned down all of the patent counterclaims by Samsung.</p> <p>Samsung has indicated that it will appeal the jury's ruling and the fine.</p> <p>Apple meanwhile is seeking to block the sale of a number of Samsung phones and tablets in the US, including the Korean company's flagship Galaxy S3 smartphone.</p> <p>Both companies are also raising marketing spending to promote their latest products ahead of the crucial year-end holiday season.</p> <p>\"Based on information currently available, Samsung expects that the iPhone 5 will infringe the asserted Samsung patents-in-suit in the same way as the other accused iPhone models,\" Samsung said in a statement.</p> <p>It also said in a separate statement on Thursday: \"Apple continues to take aggressive legal measures that will limit market competition. Under these circumstances, we have little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights.\"</p> <p>Apple Korea reiterated its position that it was the victim of copying, not vice versa.</p> <p>\"At Apple, we value originality and innovation \u2026 We make these products to delight our customers, not for our competitors to flagrantly copy.\"</p> <p>Apple's victory over Samsung was also a blow to Google, whose Android software powers the Samsung phones and tablets that were found to infringe Apple patents.</p> <p>Samsung, the biggest Android phone maker, received a second US legal setback last week when a judge at the International Trade Commission said in a preliminary ruling that Apple did not violate patents owned by Samsung.</p> <p>The Korean firm was the world's top smartphone maker in the second quarter of 2012, shipping more than 50m phones, nearly double the Apple's 26m iPhone shipments.</p>",
  "<h2>Why did Ofcom launch review whether BSkyB was a \"fit and proper\" holder of UK broadcast licences?</h2> <p>Ofcom launched its review of BSkyB on 6 July 2011, the day before News International announced that it was closing the News of the World after 168 years because of phone hacking. At the time News Corporation, BSkyB's largest shareholder with a 39.1% stake, was bidding to take full control of the company. This bid was abandoned the following week as public and political outrage over the phone-hacking scandal continued to mount.</p> <p>Although BSkyB was not implicated in the phone-hacking scandal, there were accusations that News Corp was involved in covering up alleged criminality at the tabloid and this could have had implications for the pay-TV broadcaster.</p> <h2>Findings on BSkyB</h2> <p>Ofcom cleared BSkyB of any wrongdoing and concluded it is fit and proper to hold a broadcast licence. \"To date there is no evidence that Sky was directly or indirectly involved in any of the wrongdoing either admitted or alleged to have taken place a News of the World or the Sun.\"</p> <p>Ofcom says it is still considering two cases of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/05/sky-news-hacking-emails-canoe-man\" title=\"\">email hacking which Sky News admitted to in relation to John Darwin</a>, the \"canoe man\" accused of faking his own death, when his wife, Anne, was due to stand trial for deception in July 2008. There will be a separate ruling on this in due course.</p> <h2>James Murdoch and the 2008 Gordon Taylor settlement</h2> <p>Questioning Murdoch's competence, Ofcom said it was clear at this point that Murdoch was aware of the existence of new evidence, that was forcing the company to settle with Taylor \u2013 but did not find out what it was. \"We consider that James Murdoch's exercise of responsibility was less than we would expect to see exhibited by a competent chief executive officer.\"</p> <p>The chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association got a payout of about \u00a3425,000 in 2008 for potential damages after his civil action revealed evidence suggesting more than \"one rogue reporter\" at the News of the World was involved in phone hacking. Ofcom reviewed evidence on this episode that was subsequently submitted to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee investigation into phone hacking and the Leveson inquiry.</p> <h2>James Murdoch and the Guardian article in 2009</h2> <p>Ofcom again raps Murdoch for not being more inquisitive, as it believes a responsible chief executive faced with serious allegations should have done. The regulator said he did not take seriously enough <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/08/murdoch-papers-phone-hacking\" title=\"\">a Guardian article on the Taylor settlement published in July 2009 titled \"Murdoch papers paid \u00a31m to gag phone hacking victims\" which described \"suppressed evidence\"</a> . It noted that at the time, News International issued a statement attacking the Guardian for \"irresponsible and unsubstantiated allegations\" and saying the paper had \"misled the British public\".</p> <p>Ofcom criticises Murdoch's lack of interest in getting to the bottom of the story and notes he delegated responsibility to Rebekah Brooks, who had not formally taken over as News International chief executive and had \"no personal knowledge\" of the Taylor settlement.</p> <p>\"We consider that Murdoch's failure to apprise himself of this information, given the information he accepts he knew, fell short of the exercise of responsibility to be expected of the chief executive officer and the chairman,\" says the report.</p> <h2>James Murdoch and the 2010 culture select committee phone-hacking report</h2> <p>The culture select committee accused News International of \"collective amnesia\" in 2010, stating that it was \"inconceivable\" that no one beyond a single reporter was aware of alleged phone hacking at the News of the World.</p> <p>Ofcom noted that News International's \"one rogue reporter\" line had been \"directly contradicted\" by the judge who sentenced a News of the World journalist and private investigator who worked for the paper in January 2007 after they pleaded guilty to phone-hacking related offences.</p> <p>Mr Justice Gross observed that News International did not question relevant individuals, did not review emails and there was no investigation as to who the others involved may be. Back in 2010 News International accused the select committee of \"pursuing a party political agenda\" and \"repeatedly violated the public trust\".</p> <p>Ofcom rebuked Murdoch for not being more involved in News International's response to the select committee and said that his \"lack of action\" in relation to its findings was \"both difficult to comprehend and ill-judged\".</p> <h2>James Murdoch, the New York Times and Sienna Miller</h2> <p>The New York Times published an report in September 2010 claiming \"a dozen\" reporters had said hacking was rife at the News of the World. Murdoch, at the time, said he was told by his subordinates there was \"no basis for the allegations\".</p> <p>Three months later Sienna Miller launched legal action against News International for breach of privacy over phone-hacking. Murdoch promised to investigate, to suspend any journalist involved in wrongdoing and to bring in new legal counsel to review the evidence. Ofcom noted that News International only did one of these. \"We find it difficult to comprehend James Murdoch's lack of action, given his responsibility as chairman.\"</p> <h2>Ofcom's overall conclusions on James Murdoch</h2> <p>The watchdog said there is no evidence he was \"complicit in a cover-up\" but added that News International's handling of the phone-hacking allegations \"raise questions regarding James Murdoch's competence\".</p> <p>A chief executive may delegate but also has a duty to supervise appropriately, said Ofcom. \"We found Murdoch's conduct including his failure to initiate action on his own account on a number of occasions to be both difficult to comprehend and ill-judged.\"</p> <h2>Rupert Murdoch</h2> <p>Murdoch Sr escapes censure by Ofcom, which ruled that it did not find evidence which provided a \"reasonable basis on which to conclude that Rupert Murdoch acted in a way that was inappropriate in relation to phone hacking, concealment or corruption by employees of [News Group Newspapers] or News International\".</p> <h2>James Murdoch's non-executive directorship of BSkyB</h2> <p>Ofcom found that his retention in a non-executive role did not mean that Sky was not fit and proper to hold broadcast licences.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Ofcom will keep a watching brief on BSkyB's fitness to hold a licence and will consider the findings of the Leveson inquiry \u2013 due in November \u2013 and the pending criminal proceedings relating to phone hacking if they are relevant.</p>",

  "<p>Ken Clarke has either not done his homework or is being extraordinarily disingenuous in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/justice-and-security-bill-on-track\" title=\"\">his defence of the government's justice and security bill</a>, which is designed to prevent the disclosure of any sensitive or embarrassing information in the hands of MI5 and MI6.</p> <p>Referring to the plan for proposed secret courts, he says: \"I am on the right track ... Clearly any suggestion that these closed hearings would make anything secret that is in the public domain now is emphatically wrong.\" This is thoroughly misleading and he must know it.</p> <p>Obviously anything now in the public domain cannot be put back in a bottle marked \"secret\". Presumably what he means is that the bill will not lead to the suppression of the kind of information which has been disclosed in the past. That is also seriously misleading.</p> <p>Ministers say the bill is needed to prevent information from being disclosed in civil cases, in the face of demands for compensation from those people \u2013 specifically UK citizens and residents secretly rendered to Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 suing the security and intelligence agencies. Clarke notes that such cases of alleged mistreatment have risen substantially as a result of Tony Blair's \"disastrous 'war on terror'\".</p> <p>The government has recently agreed to a number of out-of-court settlements rather than have its dirty washing revealed in public. More cases are in the pipeline. The government now proposes that any evidence, or indeed rebuttal, of abuse could in future be heard in court \u2013 but only in secret.</p> <p>But the bill is also the result of MI5, MI6, and CIA fury at the way senior judges have ruled that information showing how they colluded in the abuse and inhuman treatment \u2013 and, according to evidence heard in court, torture \u2013 of UK resident Binyam Mohamed should be disclosed.</p> <p>Such damaging information in the hands of the security and intelligence agencies must never be disclosed again, MI5 and MI6 told ministers. The Justice and Security Bill is designed precisely to stop any such disclosures from happening in the future.</p> <p>The kind of information that would be suppressed under the bill would include MI6 collusion in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/18/jack-straw-libya-rendition\" title=\"\">rendition of Libyan dissidents</a> to Colonel Gaddafi's secret police, and MI5 passing information to Gadaffi's officials about Libyan dissidents in the UK \u2013 evidence that came to light only because Nato bombs blew open the offices and filing cabinets of his security and intelligence agents.</p> <p>Clarke argues that the bill \"for the first time extend[s] civil justice into the most secret activities of the state\". Leaving aside that there are precedents \u2013 such as the Special Immigration Appeal Commission (Siac) \u2013 the fact is that such \"secret activities\" under the bill would remain secret, with neither the claimant nor his or her lawyers able to hear, let alone rebut, any material provided by the spooks.</p> <p>Clarke says an \"independent advocate\" would be in court to represent the claimants. In the consultation exercise prior to the bill's publication, the majority of these special advocates \u2013 security-cleared barristers who appear in sensitive cases already used in Siac hearings \u2013 described the government's proposals as \"inherently unfair\".</p> <p>During Lords debates on the bill this summer, the government suggested that the mere fact of a secret court case taking place could be kept secret (on the model of superinjunctions), and that it could lead to people detained in prison and denied the ancient writ of habeas corpus.</p> <p>Clarke says that, \"Judges and not the executive will have to take the key decisions about whether a closed hearing is justified.\" However, the bill gives the judge little choice but to accept a minister's claims that information must be kept secret on grounds of \"national security\" \u2013 a claim which judges have traditionally (and perhaps understandably) have been very reluctant to question.</p> <p>As David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, pointed out when questioned in parliament in June: \"Under the procedure devised in the bill, the judge does have the last word,\" he said. \"The only difficulty is that that word is dictated to the judge by the secretary of state \u2026 The judge's hands are effectively tied.\"</p> <p>\"I am instinctively liberal,\" says Clarke. His liberal reputation is no doubt why David Cameron has ensured he remains responsible for the bill though he is no longer justice secretary.</p> <p>He appears to be setting aside his liberal instincts, just as the Liberal Democrat conference threatens to do next week in Brighton. The latest conference agenda reveals an attempt to quash a motion calling for the withdrawal of the bill.</p> <p>The original motion called on all Lib Dem MPs to oppose the measure. An amendment has now been tabled backing the bill, and saying only that secret court hearings should be used as a \"last resort\" and \"to the bare minimum necessary to safeguard national security\". Such comforting but damagingly misleading words are precisely those deployed by Clarke and his fellow ministers.</p>",
  "<p>Charlie Richardson, who has died of peritonitis aged 78, was the head of&#xa0;the notorious Richardson gang, the main criminal rivals to the Krays in the 1960s. In&#xa0;1967 he was sentenced to 25 years following the so-called \"torture trial\" in which it was alleged that the gang's victims were subjected to horrific violence.</p> <p>The son of a prizefighter, Richardson was born in Twickenham, south-west London, and was first in trouble as a&#xa0;teenager for stealing a car. He worked briefly as an ice-cream salesman before being unwillingly called up for national service. During his induction interview, an officer asked him if he would give information to the Russians, to which he replied: \"Fucking right I&#xa0;would.\" He&#xa0;then cut up his uniform and pretended to be mad.</p> <p>It was in Camberwell, south London, that he, with the help of his brother, Eddie, built his empire, part legal through scrap metal and foreign investments and part illegal, through frauds, protection rackets and clubs, one of them at Elephant and Castle, cheekily named the Reform Club, where rough justice was delivered to people believed to have \"taken a liberty\".</p> <p>More businesslike than the Krays, Richardson had an office in Park Lane and at one point was making millions. He benefited from the protection of&#xa0;corrupt police officers and later said that \"the most lucrative, powerful and extensive protection racket ever to exist was administered by the Metropolitan police \u2026 sometimes we would pay people to be 'found' committing small crimes so that our friendly local protection racketeer in blue could have somebody to arrest and look like he had been busy\".</p> <p>The Richardsons clashed with the Krays and there were two related killings in 1966: a Kray associate, \"Dickie\" Hart, was shot dead at Mr Smith's club in Catford, south London, and a member of the Richardson gang, George Cornell, was murdered by&#xa0;Ronnie Kray at the Blind Beggar in&#xa0;east London.&#xa0;</p> <p>Richardson lived briefly in Canada but returned to the UK and embarked on a series of frauds involving bogus businesses and insurance scams. After&#xa0;visiting South Africa, he realised there was money to be made there in mining and exporting perlite. He&#xa0;also became involved with the South African secret service and was reported, in&#xa0;Robert Parker's book Rough Justice (1981), to have organised break-ins at the&#xa0;London offices of the Anti-Apartheid Movement and Amnesty International on their behalf. He became involved with conmen, including Jack&#xa0;\"the Rat\" Duval, which eventually led to his downfall. Angry that they could not find Duval, whom Charlie believed had&#xa0;defrauded him, the Richardsons seized one of&#xa0;Duval's associates, Lucien&#xa0;Harris, and&#xa0;administered a brutal punishment.</p> <p>This violence gradually caught up with them. On the morning of the day that England beat West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final, Richardson and 10 others, including \"Mad\" Frank Fraser, were arrested in a swoop. At&#xa0;the subsequent trial, the prosecuting counsel, Sebag Shaw, told the jury: \"This case is not about dishonesty and fraud, it is about violence and threats of violence, not \u2026 casual acts of&#xa0;violence committed in sudden anger or alarm but vicious and brutal violence systematically inflicted deliberately and cold-bloodedly and with utter and&#xa0;callous ruthlessness.\"</p> <p>Although Richardson claimed that the extent of the beatings had been exaggerated and that Harris \"didn't even need an aspirin\", the Old Bailey heard a&#xa0;very different account. Harris claimed that Richardson had shoved hot scampi in his eye and then subjected him to the torture of the \"black box\". Wires were attached to his genitals and electric shocks delivered before he was stabbed in the foot by one of Richardson's henchmen. Richardson then gave him \u00a3150 and a clean shirt, as was his custom. A beating from the Richardsons was known as \"taking a shirt from Charlie\".</p> <p>Richardson was convicted and sentenced to 25 years by the judge, Sir&#xa0;Frederick Lawton, who told him: \"One is ashamed to live in a society with men like you \u2026 It must be made clear to all those who set themselves up as gang members that they will be struck down by the law as you will be struck down.\" Richardson claimed that his conviction was inevitable: \"After all the publicity and lies, it would have been like having Caligula, Genghis Khan, Hitler and Stalin all in one box and taking the lid off and letting them scuttle away.\" Some of his gang admitted routinely snapping people's toes with pliers and pulling their teeth out and it was claimed that troublesome victims had their feet nailed to the floor.</p> <p>He absconded from open prison in 1980 but was rearrested and then finally released after serving 18 years, to be met by a Rolls-Royce and a welcome home party of champagne and lobsters. In 2009 he applied without success to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have his conviction quashed, claiming that the judge's father, a prison governor, had previously been assaulted by Fraser on Wandsworth Common, thus tainting the trial.</p> <p>Richardson's autobiography, My Manor, was published in 1992, and he went into legitimate business in the City, which he claimed was much more dishonest than anything he had been involved in before.</p> <p>He was married and had six children.</p> <p>\u2022 Charlie Richardson, gangster and&#xa0;businessman, born 1934; died 19&#xa0;September 2012</p>",
  "<p><em>You joined the Green party when you were 15. What were the values that you saw in the party then that made you make that decision?</em></p> <p>The key realisation was that we live on a planet with limited resources, on which you can't have unlimited growth. To sum it up in one image: the Greens had a poster at the time which said: \"We've only borrowed the Earth from our children.\" That single sentence still sums up the philosophy of my party for me. We need responsible lifestyles: we need to make sure that we don't use up the resources that belong to other generations, but also that we don't use up the resources of other countries. Fairness shouldn't end on Germany's doorstep.</p> <p>The nice thing is that the idea of sustainability translates very well from ecology to economics. It's in the DNA of my party that we aren't just OK with the idea of a balanced household budget, but that our very founding philosophy tells us that we shouldn't burden the next generation with mountains of debts.</p> <p><em>How has the Green party and their typical voter changed since then?</em></p> <p>The Greens are more at ease with German society and its values: this is our country, not an enemy we have to fight against. We want to change and improve this country because we like it. And society as a whole has become greener too. When I joined, I would have never believed that the world's fourth largest economy would eventually agree to phase out nuclear energy \u2013 and that even though the Greens were in opposition. What used to be considered alternative ideas are now mainstream policy.</p> <p><em>For example?</em></p> <p>When I was young, I used to collect rubbish in my home town and recycle in my spare time. At school I had learned how hard and energy-inefficient it was to produce aluminium, and how hard to break it down again. So my friends and I developed a concept whereby we would start aluminium collection points around the town and then take the bins to collection points outside the city. My mother used to curse me, because we ended up with piles of aluminium in our basement. But eventually the local council cottoned on to the scheme and started doing the same thing professionally.</p> <p><em>Why is the Green party so much more successful in Germany than in the UK?</em></p> <p>I wouldn't say that. Let's not forget that the British Greens once got 15% at European elections \u2013 we've never managed that much. The French managed more than 16%. Feeling a bond with nature isn't a uniquely German phenomenon. Of course, the debates can run differently at times. For example, the debate on nuclear power takes on a different course in Germany \u2013 the famed \"German angst\" does play a role, and I think that's correct. In the UK, the nuclear debate is more of an argument about cost. But that's not to say that the end results aren't similar: ie, that hardly anyone builds nuclear power stations these days. Everyone is more realistic about the dangers of nuclear.</p> <p><em>How would you sell the benefits of wind energy to the Brits?</em></p> <p>That's easy. It's not about ecology: there are pragmatic economic reasons for taking wind energy seriously. Onshore wind energy is cheaper and faster; offshore is more expensive and takes longer to build. It's that simple. For those who think it spoils their view of the landscape: would you rather have a nuclear power station plonked in the middle of the countryside? I find that logic strange. And of course no one in the Green party thinks you should just put windfarms anywhere \u2013 there are parts of the countryside that should be off limits.</p> <p>In the past, the energy market in Germany used to be run by four big players. Since the shift to renewables that we helped to bring about, regional authorities and cities council have become empowered to act as players in their own right, buying back the networks that they sold to private companies in the past. In Germany, a large number of windfarms are regionally owned: that helps to decentralise power and encourages competition.</p> <p><em>What do you say to critics of Germany's nuclear phaseout, who argue that it will merely end up having to import more dirty coal energy from abroad?</em></p> <p>We are looking at a third industrial revolution, and just as there were once those who opposed the invention of the steam engine, there are now those who hark back to nuclear energy. In Germany we now have just over 20% of our energy coming from renewable sources. All predictions from the past have turned out not to be true: when I went to school, my teachers used to say that maybe, just maybe we might have 3% of renewable energy one day. Angela Merkel says we'll have 35% by 2020; we at the Green party say it'll be 45%. My guess is: we'll both be wrong, because it'll be even more than that.</p> <p>And at any rate, don't listen to what Cem \u00d6zdemir has to say on this, don't listen to what the Greens have to say, listen to what Siemens is doing. Siemens are not switching from nuclear to clean energy because they want to lose money: they want to make profit. And I'd warn anyone who questions whether they'll manage: industrial policy, that's one thing the Germans know how to get right. If the Brits would rather hand the first mover advantage down to us, then so be it \u2013 as a German, I thank them for it. We already cater for many of the markets for renewable energy around the globe, and our future competitors are more likely to come from China than from the other side of the Channel.</p> <p>In Germany, industry is now starting to thank us for pestering in the past, because it forced them to go through the kind of innovations that the rest of the world is now catching up with. The Brits are still discussing whether they should insulate their houses better in the future, and we insulate them.</p> <p><em>Germany is proud of its export industry. But in order to make Europe work, doesn't Germany need to start importing more as well?</em></p> <p>I don't think it's a matter of either/or. The traditional left's mistake is that they've only read half of Keynes, namely the first bit about not making a recession worse by trying to save money. You learn that in the first term at university. But the second part of what Keynes says, that you have to pay your debts back in the end, that bit isn't so easy. It's a nice idea, but in reality no one does it \u2013 especially when you're dealing with four- to five-year electoral cycles.</p> <p>Germany's mistake under Merkel has been to assume that a country like Spain can get rid of its debt problem purely through austerity. So it's not a matter of \"either/or\", but a matter of \"and\": we need debt brakes, but also a long-term perspective for growth. And in order to get there, you have to deal with bad interest rates: our suggestion would be a \"sinking fund\" to pay down excessive sovereign debt in the eurozone.</p> <p><em>When, or if Europe emerges from the current crisis, what will it look like?</em></p> <p>Europe's problem isn't that Germany exports too much. The problem is that we haven't done enough to increase demand in Germany. The recent increase in pay rates was a small step, but the lack of a basic minimum wage is a problem. That's an absurd German quirk: it doesn't make sense for our British friends to have a minimum wage but not us.</p> <p>Europe's other problem is that there are some countries within the eurozone who are no longer capable of being competitive. Too much debt is certainly a problem in Greece, but not everywhere across the eurozone. Our main problem is that we need to become more competitive, and Germany shouldn't just stand by the sideline and comment but become an active member of the community.</p> <p><em>There's a theory that says we're looking at a trend towards ever smaller parties across Europe, who cater exclusively for regional and specialist interests. Is Germany on the path to Belgian conditions?</em></p> <p>That's hard to say. We saw the rise of a new party with the Pirates in Germany, but we are currently seeing a decline in their polling results. It's certainly true that the days of lifelong voter loyalty are over \u2013 all parties notice that. But you see that in Great Britain too, even if you have a majority voting system. If you look at the power of Ukip in some parts of the country, and the effect it is having on Tory policy, then you can see that even a party that gets 3-4% can wield a lot of influence. In every country in Europe there is currently a lot of insecurity, and populists are trying to exploit that.</p> <p><em>Does Germany still have a problem with the far right?</em></p> <p>We have to be honest enough to admit that there is a problem, particularly in the east. In most parts of Germany, we make a point of not entering a dialogue with the NPD [the National Democratic party] \u2013 we regard them as an anti-democratic movement. But we have to realise that there are small pockets in the country where that isn't the case, because the other parties have simply withered away. There are no short-term fixes for that, but we shouldn't ignore it completely either.</p> <p>We have to make sure that we don't just try to ban the extreme right, but also that we support those movements and those citizens that stand up to the far right. There's still plenty Germany can learn from countries who have more experience with diversity: one important step would be to make sure that the police force reflects the ethnic diversity of the population.</p> <p><em>Does Germany have a problem with the way it treats its migrant population?</em></p> <p>For a long time, Germans only knew non-whites living in Germany as <em>Ausl\u00e4nder</em>, \"foreigners\". Then they started talking about <em>Einwanderer</em>, \"immigrants\". But I'm not an immigrant, I migrated to Germany via the maternity ward of a German hospital. When I speak to my American friends and they ask me what generation immigrant I am, I tell them that in Germany, I'm considered a second-generation immigrant. But to them, I would be a first-generation immigrant, because I was born in Germany.</p> <p>When the Greens were last in government, we changed the law so that people who were born in Germany would also be legally certified as Germans \u2013 replacing a law introduced by Kaiser Wilhelm in 1913. If we win the next election, we want to extend the citizenship law further \u2013 not because we want to make things easier for immigrants, but because we think it's in Germany's interest that people who have lived in the country for a long time are recognised as citizens. Solving problems is always easier among citizens than between citizens and non-citizens.</p> <p>In 1998, I said I wished that people with a similar background to mine could play football for Germany. I got into lots of trouble for that: a lot of Germans shook their head and I got criticised in the Turkish press. And look at the national team now.</p>",
  "<p>Almost immediately after President Obama announced the killing of Osama bin Laden, top government officials, including then-CIA Director Leon Panetta and top terrorism adviser John Brennan, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/04/osama-bin-laden-killing-us-story-change\">made numerous false statements</a> about what took place. That included the claim that Bin Laden was killed after he engaged in a \"firefight\", that he <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8491108/Osama-bin-Laden-day-two-and-a-new-version-of-how-events-unfolded.html\">used his wife as a human shield</a> to protect himself, and that he was living in luxury in a $1m mansion.</p> <p>None of those claims, central to the story the White House told the world, turned out to be true. Bin Laden was unarmed and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/us/politics/05binladen.html?hp\">nobody in the house</a> where Bin Laden was found ever fired a single shot (a courier in an adjacent guest house was the only one to shoot, at the very beginning of the operation). Bin Laden never used his wife or anyone else as a shield. And the house was dilapidated, showed little sign of luxury, and was worth one-quarter of what it was claimed. <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/osama-bin-laden-killing-media\">Numerous other claims made by the administration</a> about the raid <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/05/debrief-bin-laden-raid-sea-burial-kill\">remain unanswered</a> because of its steadfast insistence on secrecy and non-disclosure (except when it <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/09/feds-hide-seal-name-given-to-hollywood-135685.html\">concerns Hollywood filmmakers</a>).</p> <p>Would it have mattered had the White House been truthful about the Bin Laden raid from the start? It would have undoubtedly made no difference for many people, who simply craved Osama bin Laden's death without regard to how it was done. But it certainly would have made a difference for at least some people around the world in terms of how they perceived of these actions and whether they approved \u2013 which is presumably why the White House was so eager to insist on these falsehoods and to ensure that the world's perception was shaped by them. (Please spare me the \"fog of war\" excuse: when the so-called \"fog of war\" causes the US government to make inaccurate claims that <em>undermine </em>its interests, rather than <em>bolster</em> them \u2013 as always happens \u2013 then that excuse will be plausible.)</p> <p>There's obviously an enormous difference between killing someone in a firefight and shooting him in cold blood while he's unarmed. The morning after the Bin Laden killing was announced, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/05/02/bin_laden_12/\">I wrote</a> that although I'd have preferred he be captured and tried, \"if he in fact used force to resist capture, then the US military was entitled to use force against him, the way American police routinely do against suspects who use violence to resist capture.\" At least one legal scholar has <a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/2012/08/29/author-of-no-easy-day-admits-to-committing-a-war-crime/\">changed his mind</a> about the legality of the killing, in the wake of evidence that Bin Laden was killed while lying on the ground, unarmed and severely wounded.</p> <p>But no matter. The White House's initial statements about what happened, false though they turned out to be, forever shaped perceptions of that event. Many people are unwilling to change their minds even in the wake of new evidence, while many others hear only of the initial claims made when news coverage is at its peak and never become aware of subsequent corrections. Combine that with the generalized \"Look Forward, Not Backward\" mentality <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K27oIJlAlA\">popularized by President Obama</a> \u2013 as embodied by <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/08/shut-up-and-move-on-kerry-says/\">John Kerry's \"shut up and move on\" decree</a> to those asking questions about what really happened in the Bin Laden raid \u2013 and those initial White House falsehoods did the trick.</p> <p>We now see exactly the same pattern emerging with the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya and the killing of the US ambassador. For a full week now, administration officials have <a href=\"http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/white-house-insists-benghazi-attack-was-not-pre-planned-was-all-about-a-movie/\">categorically insisted</a> that the prime, if not only, cause of the attack was spontaneous anger over the anti-Muhammad film, The Innocence of Muslims.</p> <p>Last week, White House spokesman Jay Carney <a href=\"http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2012/09/14/shocking-video-wh-spox-jay-carney-says-attacks-are-reaction-to-film-not-us-policy-and-were-not-pre-planned/\">insisted</a> that \"these protests, were in reaction to a video that had spread to the region.\" On Friday, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/carney-global-protests-directed-at-offensive-video-not-u-s-policy-or-the-obama-administration/\">he claimed</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'This is a fairly volatile situation, and it is in response not to US policy, not to, obviously, the administration, not to the American people. It is in response to a video \u2013 a film \u2013 that we have judged to be reprehensive and disgusting. That in no way justifies any violent reaction to it. But this is not a case of protests directed at the United States, writ large, or at US policy. This is in response to a video that is offensive and \u2013 to Muslims.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On Sunday, UN ambassador Susan Rice, when asked about the impetus for the attack, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/ambassador-susan-rice-libya-attack-not-premeditated/\">said that</a> \"this began as, it was a spontaneous \u2013 not a premeditated \u2013 response to what had transpired in Cairo,\" and added: \"In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated.\" In other interviews, she <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/17/un-amb-rice-libya-attack-was-spontaneous/\">insisted</a> that the Benghazi violence was a \"spontaneous\" reaction to the film.</p> <p>Predictably, and by design, most media accounts from the day after the Benghazi attack repeated the White House line as though it were fact, just as they did for the Bin Laden killing. Said <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/12/160989062/u-s-ambassador-to-libya-killed-in-attack\">NPR on 12 September</a>: \"The US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi <em>by protesters angry over a film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet Muhammad</em>.\" The Daily Beast <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/12/riot-after-anti-islam-film-u-s-ambassador-to-libya-killed.html\">reported</a> that the ambassador \"died in a rocket attack on the embassy amid violent protests over a US-produced film deemed insulting to Islam.\" To date, numerous people <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-ambassador-killed-libya-sam-bacile-stevens-369785\">believe</a> \u2013 as though there were no dispute about it \u2013 that Muslims attacked the consulate and killed the US ambassador \"because they were angry about a film\".</p> <p>As it turns out, this claim is almost certainly false. And now, a week later, even the US government is acknowledging that, as <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/09/19/169102/us-official-calls-benghazi-consulate.html\">McClatchy reports this morning</a> [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Obama administration acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that last week's assault on the US consulate compound in Benghazi that left the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead was a 'terrorist attack' apparently launched by local Islamic militants and foreigners linked to al-Qaida's leadership or regional allies.</p> <p>\"'I would say they were killed in the course of a terrorist attack,' said Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.</p> <p>\"It was the first time that a senior administration official had said the attack was <em>not the result of a demonstration over an anti-Islam video that has been cited as the spark for protests in dozens of countries over the past week</em> .'The picture that is emerging is one where a number of different individuals were involved,' Olsen said.\" [My emphasis]</p> </blockquote> <p>Worse, it isn't as though there had been no evidence of more accurate information before Wednesday. To the contrary, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chaos-at-the-consulate-as-militants-attack/2012/09/12/f92ad9d2-fcfe-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html\">most evidence from the start</a> strongly suggested that the White House's claims \u2013 that this attack was motivated by anger over a film \u2013 were false. From McClatchy:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The head of Libya's interim government, key US lawmakers and experts contend that the attack appeared long-planned, complex and well-coordinated, matching descriptions given to McClatchy last week by the consulate's landlord and a wounded security guard, who denied there was a protest at the time and said the attackers carried the banner of Ansar al-Shariah, an Islamist militia.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, Libya's president has spent the week <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2012/09/libyan-president-no-doubt-consulate-attack-preplanned-135664.html\">publicly announcing</a> that there is \"no doubt\" the attack was planned well in advance and had nothing to do with the video.</p> <p>CBS News <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/report-never-anti-american-protest-benghazi-only-planned-attack_652761.html\">reported Thursday morning</a> that there was no anti-video protest at all at the consulate. Witnesses insist, said CBS, \"that there was <em>never</em> an anti-American protest outside of the consulate. Instead, they say, it came under planned attack.\" That, noted the network, \"is in direct contradiction to the administration's account of the incident.\" The report concluded: \"What's clear is that the public won't get a detailed account of what happened until after the election.\"</p> <p>The Obama White House's interest in spreading this falsehood is multi-fold and obvious:</p> <p>For one, the claim that this attack was just about anger over an anti-Muhammad video completely absolves the US government of any responsibility or even role in provoking the anti-American rage driving it. After all, if the violence that erupted in that region is driven only by anger over some independent film about Muhammad, then no rational person would blame the US government for it, and there could be no suggestion that its actions in the region \u2013 things like <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-16/nato-airstrike-kills-eight-women-civilians-in-afghanistan.html\">this</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/yemen/7806882/US-cluster-bombs-killed-35-women-and-children.html\">this</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/obama-to-abbas-u-s-will-veto-palestinian-statehood-bid-at-un-1.385932\">this</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/13/u_s_drones_deeply_unpopular_around_the_world/\">this</a> \u2013 had any role to play. </p> <p>The White House capitalized on the strong desire to believe this falsehood: it's deeply satisfying to point over there at those Muslims and scorn their primitive religious violence, while ignoring the massive amounts of violence to which one's own country continuously subjects them. It's much more fun and self-affirming to scoff: \"can you believe those Muslims are so primitive that they killed our ambassador over a film?\" than it is to acknowledge: \"our country and its allies have continually bombed, killed, invaded, and occupied their countries and supported their tyrants.\"</p> <p>It is always more enjoyable to scorn the acts of the Other Side than it is to acknowledge the bad acts of one's own. That's the self-loving mindset that enables the New York Times to write <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/opinion/the-united-states-and-the-muslim-world.html?\">an entire editorial today</a> purporting to analyze Muslim rage without once mentioning the numerous acts of American violence aimed at them (much of which the Times editorial page supports). Falsely claiming that the Benghazi attacks were about this film perfectly flattered those jingoistic prejudices.</p> <p>Then, there are the implications for the intervention in Libya, which Obama's defenders relentlessly tout as one of his great victories. But the fact that the Benghazi attack was likely premeditated and carried out by anti-American factions vindicates many of the criticisms of that intervention. Critics of the war in Libya warned that the US was siding with (and arming and empowering) violent extremists, including al-Qaida elements, that would eventually cause the US to claim it had to return to Libya to fight against them \u2013 just as its funding and arming of Saddam in Iraq and the mujahideen in Afghanistan subsequently justified new wars against those one-time allies. </p> <p>War critics also argued that the intervention would bring massive instability and suffering to the people of Libya; today,<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/libyas-central-government-exercises-little-authority-outside-capital/2012/09/19/d8f46610-0280-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story.html\"> the Washington Post reports</a> that \u2013 just as the \"president of Afghanistan\" is really the mayor of Kabul and the \"Iraqi government\" long exercised sovereignty only in Baghdad's Green Zone \u2013 the central Libyan government exercises little authority outside of Tripoli. And intervention critics also warned that dropping bombs in a country and killing civilians, no matter how noble the intent supposedly is, would produce blowback in the form of those who would then want to attack the US.</p> <p>When the White House succeeded in falsely blaming the consulate attacks on anger over this video, all of those facts were obscured. The truth, now that it is emerging, underscores how unstable, lawless and dangerous Libya has become \u2013 far from the grand success story war proponents like to tell. As McClatchy noted in Thursday's report:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Libya remains plagued by armed groups nearly a year after the US-backed ouster of the late dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Yet the facility was primarily defended by local guards who may have been complicit \u2026</p> <p>\"Since the fall of Gaddafi last year, Libya's security has been dependent on a group of armed militias, including Ansar al-Shariah, that represent a wide variety of political strains and interests and remain heavily armed with weapons looted from Gaddafi storehouses. Interior Ministry forces and the Supreme Security Committee have been accused of complicity in recent attacks by Islamic fundamentalists on mosques and shrines affiliated with the moderate Sufi strain of Islam.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, there are the garden-variety political harms to the White House from the truth about these attacks. If the killing of the ambassador were premeditated and unrelated to the film, then it vests credibility in the criticism that the consulate should have been much better-protected, particularly on 9/11. And in general, the last thing a president running for re-election wants is an appearance that he is unable to protect America's diplomats from a terrorist group his supporters love to claim that he has heroically vanquished.</p> <p>The falsehood told by the White House \u2013 this was just a spontaneous attack prompted by this video that we could not have anticipated and had nothing to do with \u2013 fixed all of those problems. Critical attention was thus directed to Muslims (<em>what kind of people kill an ambassador over a film?</em>) and away from the White House and its policies. </p> <p>The independent journalist IF Stone <a href=\"http://www.ifstone.org/macpherson.php\">famously noted</a> that the number one rule of good journalism, even of good citizenship, is to remember that \"all governments lie.\" Yet, no matter how many times we see this axiom proven true, over and over, there is still a tendency, a desire, to believe that the US government's claims are truthful and reliable. </p> <p>The Obama administration's claims about the Benghazi attack are but the latest in <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/07/18/washingtons-untrue-claims-no-civilian-deaths-in-pakistan-drone-strikes/\">a long line of falsehoods</a> it has spouted on crucial issues, all in order to serve its interests and advance its agenda. Perhaps it is time to subject those claims to intense skepticism and to demand evidence before believing they are true.</p> <h2>Other matters</h2> <p>A former British army captain involved in co-ordinating drone attacks, James Jeffrey, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/drone-warfare-deadly-civilian-toll\">an outstanding op-ed in the Guardian</a> explaining why drones are so odious and dangerous. I recommend it highly.</p> <p>Relating to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/conservatives-democrats-free-speech-muslims\">free speech debate</a> that has emerged over the last week, I have a question for those who insist that advocating or inciting violence is not and should not be included within the protections of free speech: should <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/fox-news-bob-beckel-calls_n_793467.html\">this statement</a> have led to an arrest? Relatedly: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/opinion/21Ackerman.html\">many people believe</a> it was illegal for Obama to fight a war in Libya after Congress voted against the war's authorization, and many (including Obama) believe it would be illegal for the president to bomb Iran without congressional approval. Should advocacy of <em>those acts of illegal violence</em> be illegal and lead to arrest?</p> <p>The schedule of speaking events I'll be doing in late September and October has been slightly changed.

  "<p>Movies about assassins generally show them as ascetic samurai loners, broodingly dismantling and reconstructing their weapons as they wait for the hit in monkish seclusion, chain-smoking, keeping small talk to a minimum with their employers, who are in a similar laconic state, and who, in any case, may be secretly awed by their hitman's icy professionalism. Killing Them Softly is different. This killer, Cogan \u2013 played by Brad Pitt \u2013 is relaxed and talkative; he is craggy, leonine, casual and imperious; absolutely on top of his game, but with a flaw. He cannot kill anyone he's met, and hates to kill up close, squeamish about them begging for mercy. So he has to murder at a distance; it's what he calls \"killing them softly\", though without acknowledging <a href=\"http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2012/02/roberta_flack_75th_birthday.php\" title=\"\">Roberta Flack</a>.</p> <p>Cogan is part antihero, part choric observer, terrifically acted by Pitt in this compelling movie from Andrew Dominik, the director who made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/84937/chopper\" title=\"\">Chopper</a> (2000) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/120871/the.assassination.of.jesse.james.by.the.coward.robert.ford\" title=\"\">The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</a> (2007). He has adapted the 1974 crime novel <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogan%27s_Trade\" title=\"\">Cogan's Trade</a> by George V Higgins and updated it to the America of 2008, the era of financial meltdown and political changeover. When <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/may/22/killing-them-softly-review\" title=\"\">I first saw this at Cannes this year</a>, I found some of the overtly satirical moments too emphatic. The TV news on in the background will persistently give us Bush or Obama at ironic moments. But maybe the film's politics are part of its swaggering insolence.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-390546820\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/5/23/20120523CannesSoftly-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/5/23/20120523CannesSoftly_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/20120523CannesSoftly/20120523CannesSoftly.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/5/23/20120523CannesSoftly_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/5/23/20120523CannesSoftly-16x9.mp4\"/> </video>   <p>It is a violent ensemble nightmare of middle-management mobster incompetence in the tradition of Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction, Casino and TV's The Sopranos. The drama is thrillingly and casually pessimistic, a world of weary tough guys complaining about having to clear up the mess left by other screw-ups, and for less money than they'd hoped for. This is a stiflingly and reekingly unhappy male world.</p> <p>Dominik deploys two classic tropes. From Pulp Fiction, there is the \"Royale with Cheese\" banal pre-violence conversation, and the classic gangster \"betrayal\" misdirection, which I associate with the buildup to Tommy DeVito's made-guy ceremony from GoodFellas. Someone gets shot, suddenly and at close range, having been lulled along with the audience into a false sense of security by a chat about what they were going to do later.</p> <p>The political dimension comes in two parts. In 2008, US taxpayers were asked to bail out banks for the sake of confidence and prestige, and these taxpayers also had to tighten their belts. Here, local wiseguy Markie (Ray Liotta) has to be whacked for robbing some other wiseguys' poker game: he didn't do it, but someone has to be seen to get killed for the sake of confidence and prestige, and hitmen have to accept a reduced fee in the economic climate.</p> <p>Cogan is contracted by an anonymous apparatchik played by Richard Jenkins, whose own criminal superiors are as cautious as any of the suits in corporate America: their paralysis is another symptom of the economic times. The robbery was actually done by two ridiculous jerks, Frankie and Russell, superbly played by Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn, whose boss must also now be whacked: this is Johnny \"Squirrel\" Amato, played by Vincent Curatola. But Cogan subcontracts this wet job, and here is where Dominik shows how Cogan is guilty of sentimental incompetence. He gives the work to his old friend Mickey, hilariously played by James Gandolfini, who to Cogan's polite dismay, shows himself to be nowadays unequal to the task of contract killing: a heavy drinker and prostitute addict who is morosely in unrequited love with one of the girls he despises. Mickey exhibits the undignified emotions Cogan hates in his own victims. Could it be that Mickey, poor Mickey, is the endgame those in the business face? If they survive, that is. He is their future, in worse shape than anything in the morgue.</p> <p>Crime equals chaos in Killing Them Softly. It's a reminder of what Tom Wolfe wrote: criminals are not romantic desperados who go outside the law to get what they want. They are ruthless, greedy, stupid people who get themselves into a progressively worsening, violent mess. There is an entropy in Killing Them Softly, a spiralling down; every scene, with its quarrelling and its bitching, its bantering and its bloodsplattering, is not leading anywhere as such \u2013 it's just an open-ended vivisectional demonstration of unhappiness and confusion.</p> <p>Dominik gives Pitt his grandstanding moment in terms of one satirical aria of a speech, contrived perhaps, and its moral-drawing jars with the icy amorality of all that has gone before. But it is delivered with such angrily dismissive power. This is an unrepentantly cynical take on the hope-and-change promised to the US in 2008; this year's election race makes it look even bleaker, an icily confident black comedy of continued disillusion.</p>",
  "<p>Three-quarters of the world's human population of seven billion live under strong government curbs on religion, or among serious \"social hostilities\" involving faith issues, find researchers.</p> <p>The US and UK, say the researchers, are among countries showing a worrying rise in religious discrimination.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Government/Rising-Tide-of-Restrictions-on-Religion.aspx\" title=\"\">The conclusions of the project, conducted by the Pew Research Centre, an American thinktank,</a>'s Forum on Religion and Public Life, were published on Thursday. The analysis, of 197 countries and territories, identifies a sharp rise in religious limits globally and a 6% increase in restrictions in the four years until 2010.</p> <p>The survey, The Rising Tide of Restrictions on Religion, is the second successive one by Pew to note increasing intolerance worldwide.</p> <p>Painting a stark picture of a \"rising tide\" of intolerance and government restrictions on religious matters, the report cites evidence including \"crimes, malicious acts and violence motivated by religious hatred or bias, as well as increased government interference with worship or other religious practices\".</p> <p>The project notes an acceleration in intolerance, reporting a 63% rise from mid-2009 to mid-2010 in numbers of countries that increased government restrictions, in comparison with Pew's last survey that had noted a 56% rise.</p> <p>Remarking on the trend, the report says: \"The number of countries where harassment or intimidation of specific religious groups took place rose from 147 as of mid-2009, to 160 as of mid-2010.\"</p> <p>In the survey the UK is second among countries marked \"high\" \u2013 on a scale from very high, the top offending countries, to low \u2013 with regard to \"social hostility\", one of the two indices used to evaluate levels of intolerance.</p> <p>The ranking puts the UK, on the table of descending scores, in the next place down below Kenya, and at one place above Burma. The ranking marks a rise for the UK since the last survey. In Europe only Russia fared worse.</p> <p>In the second index \u2013 covering government restrictions \u2013 the UK remains on the \"moderate\" list.</p> <p>Commenting on the UK's social hostility placing, a lead researcher, Brian Grim, said the rise had been driven by several issues. \"That included Christians voicing concern about being able to talk about their religion, a spike in antisemitic incidents and also anti-Muslim sentiment. It also included concern about issues within the Muslim community itself and honour killings.\"</p> <p>In the period covered by the survey there had been an upsurge in sectarian tension in Northern Ireland which had since subsided.</p> <p>Among other countries showing marked increases in religious intolerance for the first time, though still classed only as \"moderate\", is the US, which also registers a rise for the first time on both scales, moving from a low category of religious limits to moderate.</p> <p>\"From mid-2009 to mid-2010,\" the report's authors note, \"a number of the sources used in the study reported an increase in the number of incidents at state and local level in which members of some religious groups faced restrictions on their ability to practise their faith.\"</p> <p>These included \"religious groups in the US [which had] faced difficulties in obtaining zoning permits to build or expand houses of worship, religious schools or other religious institutions\".</p> <p>A more marked increase was recorded in the social hostilities index, moving the US from the lower end of the moderate range of hostilities to the upper end of the moderate range. This was largely driven by an increase in religion-related terrorist attacks in the year to mid-2010.</p> <p>The report also noted legislation by some states to ban \"sharia law\", or prevent construction of mosques.</p> <p>The percentage of the world's population living in countries with low levels of restriction, the report calculates, fell between 2007 and 2010 from 14% to 6%.</p> <p>The report is being published amid a rash of protests in the Muslim world following the posting online of a videospoof that mocks the life of Muhammad.</p> <p>The survey reports that in all five main regions of the world \u2013 including the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa where religious restrictions previously had been declining \u2013 freedom of faith is coming under increasing pressure.</p> <p>While the survey notes growing religious restrictions in places where that might be expected, including in Nigeria which has seen a spate of attacks against Christians, as well as in Indonesia, where pressure from Islamists forced dozens of churches to close, it also identifies growing problems in some western democracies including Switzerland, which, in 2009, banned the construction of minarets, and the US.</p> <p>The report \u2013 which detailed religious freedom up until the end of 2010 and is the third such survey Pew has carried out \u2013 says it identified a four-year high involving \"harassment or intimidation of particular religious groups\" \u2013 including five out of seven of the main religious groupings \u2013 including Jews, Christians, Buddhists and adherents of folk or traditional religions.</p> <p>Not all religions, however, faced harassment in the same way.</p> <p>\"Christians,\" the survey reports, \"were harassed by government officials or organisations in 95 countries in the year ending in mid-2010 and by social groups or individuals in 77 countries.</p> <p>\"Muslims also were more likely to be harassed by governments (74 countries) than by social groups or individuals (64 countries). Jews, by contrast, experienced social harassment in many more countries than they faced government harassment.\"</p> <p>The survey's government restrictions index marks countries by 20 religious curb indicators, including efforts to prohibit practising faiths. The social hostilities measure calculates religious hostility by groups and others against rival beliefs.</p> <p>Using these two scales the authors identified a rise in countries with \"very high\" levels of government curbs \u2013 from 10 in 2007 to 18 in 2010.</p> <p>In that period 10 countries were added to the list of countries with very high levels of restriction \u2013 Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Indonesia, Maldives, Russia, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen \u2013 while only two, Brunei and Turkey, were downgraded.</p> <p>The report adds: \"The countries with very high social hostilities also rose, from 10 as of mid-2007, to 15 as of mid-2010, as five countries (Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia and Yemen) were added to the very high category and none were removed \u2026 meanwhile, half of the countries in the study (98) had low levels of social hostilities in mid-2010, down from 114 in mid-2007.\"</p> <p>North Korea was excluded from the study because of the difficulty of accessing up-to-date information.</p> <p>Perhaps more telling has been the increase in countries experiencing social hostilities over religion, with four times as many countries (17) showing a marked increase as had seen a decrease (four).</p> <p>The increase in religious curbs comes as recent surveys have appeared to demonstrate that people around the world are becoming more religious.</p>",
  "<p><em>Today's extract from the updated edition of <strong>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial*</strong> is by a law lecturer, <strong>Damian Carney</strong>.</em></p> <p><em>His chapters opens with an examination of ideas for reformed press self-regulation put forward to the Leveson inquiry by Lords Hunt and Black and by the Media Standards Trust. He also considers alternative dispute resolution (ADR) schemes. This is the concluding part of the chapter...</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396437367\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348150908173/HackBookFront.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Though a number of different schemes have been put forward to the inquiry, there are certain features on which a large degree of consensus is emerging. </p> <p>The new regulator has to be more separated from the press than the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) and be seen to be more independent. Many contributors believe the way to do this is by having a majority of non-press members on the constituent parts of the new body. </p> <p>There is general consensus that appointments must be by an independent body (which may include the new regulator itself) rather than government. </p> <p>Publications should be required as part of the new regulatory regime to establish more robust internal complaints mechanisms, with the role of the new regulator being only to hear those complaints that the internal mechanisms cannot deal with.</p> <p>This is very important as it also provides a means of reducing the costs of the new regulator by making use of it a \"last resort,\" whilst the calls for annual reports and the identification of an employee of the publication as having responsibility for dealing with complaints and ensuring compliance that normally accompany such proposals, ensures transparency. </p> <p>Identifying a responsible person for a publication or publishing group's ethics gives that individual an incentive to ensure that there is compliance with the code within their organisation. There is some consensus that the new regulator must have both a complaints and a standards compliance role, although much variation exists about the former.</p> <p>There are other areas of disagreement. The debate as to whether the new scheme should be based on statute or left to the publications to self-regulate is hotly contested. </p> <p>However, given that many of the high profile statutory scheme proposals are very light touch, it seems unlikely that Lord Justice Leveson would recommend a statutory body, funded by the government, in which the government would have any direct input in its day to day running.</p> <p>Fears of the press that any statutory underpinnings or recognition of the new regulator would lead to a slippery slope whereby more and more statutory control was imposed seems to be scaremongering. </p> <p>Statute has created numerous bodies and offices where the government of the day has been prevented from intervention once they have been set up and operated.</p> <p>The emphasis in proposals on an independent appointments system highlight a broad consensus that the government should not be involved in the appointments of the new regulator; and most of the funding schemes that have been suggested indicate that no state subsidy is desirable. Whilst this might be desirable, it may not be practical. </p> <p>The proposals stress that a new robust regulatory system with greater powers to investigate and control standards can be funded by relatively minimum levies on media companies and/or by those companies paying for investigations against them. </p> <p>The argument that this would, therefore, allow the complainant to continue with his complaint, and not place an excessive cost burden on the state may seem attractive but it places a much greater financial burden on the press than the existing PCC system (exacerbated by the likely requirement for new internal complaints and compliance systems). </p> <p>The new regulator is also likely to have a more broader remit, with responsibility for at least some online-only publications, and levies on publications may have to be substantial in order for the new functions it is to take on to work.</p> <p>Suggestions that a \"polluters pay principle\" should be in operation to ensure that the additional burden is borne by those publications that are found to be in breach of the code has a certain attraction since, if properly calibrated, it could avoid or reduce substantially any need for state funding. </p> <p>If an unethical media organisation is to pay more of the costs of the regulatory system this would deter breaches of the code, which would have the virtue of incentivising publications to comply with it. </p> <p>If this works then it would help reduce the costs to the regulator over time as the regulator would have less work to do.</p> <p>The need for government funding in such a system may therefore seem to be unnecessary, although questions remain as to whether the state should give a one-off start-up grant to the new regulator and provide a financial buffer in case of media organisations being reluctant to pay their dues.</p> <p>A further issue that needs resolving is what publications the new regulator should cover. The \"death of print\" and emergence of online news outlets suggests that the new regulator should be spreading its wings beyond traditional printed newspapers and journals. </p> <p>This immediately raises the spectre of control of the internet and the blogger, and a possible infringement of free speech. This may not matter because engagement in unethical behaviour by such sites may also involve breaches of the law, and such sites will be checked, to a degree, by the ordinary law. </p> <p>The target of their attention, celebrities, can afford to litigate when there are invasions of privacy or harassment, whilst if \"civilians\" are caught up in the report the relatively cheap harassment suit or prosecution is available.</p> <p>The problem with online publications is that they can be set up relatively cheaply and quickly and have a huge following in a relatively short space of time.</p> <p>Their influence can, therefore, be potentially as important as major media players, and the spectre in recent years of politicians playing to websites such as Mumsnet, shows how even what might be considered a non-political special interest site becoming an agenda-setter. </p> <p>Yet no one would suggest that Mumsnet should be regulated. It provides news much in the same way as the newsletter or bulletin did in the pre-internet world. Can a definition of the type of site which has a degree of equivalence to the newspaper rather newsletter be made? </p> <p>If it can, what is to stop such sites off-shoring? Extending a regulator's coverage to online and new media platform publications is perhaps one of the most difficult tasks facing Lord Justice Leveson.</p> <p>His inquiry's draft criteria state: \"Any solution must be perceived as effective and credible both by the press as an industry and by the public: a) It must strike a balance, capable of being accepted as reasonable, legitimate and in the public interest by all.\"</p> <p>The public interest is at the core of the new regime, and it must be addressed both in the structure of the new regulator, its powers and the code it enforces.</p> <p>For this reason, it is important that Lord Justice Leveson ensures that the new regulator does not overburden the press with costs and new sanctions, but provides sufficient relief to those complaining about press misconduct; minimises both press and state influence over the regulator; and ensures that all regular publications above a certain size (which might include elements of turnover and readership) are within its control. </p> <p>This suggests a form of statutory regime that makes membership of the new regulator compulsory for those publications that meet criteria similar to those in the previous sentence.</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> Former ITN chief executive and senior executive at Ofcom, <strong>Stewart Purvis</strong>, puts the case for the Media Standards Trust's system of press regulation, which was presented to the Leveson inquiry </p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis.

  "<p><em>My father's elderly Windows XP laptop needs replacing. Its hinges are damaged, the case is cracked, the power connector makes poor contact, the battery lasts almost no time at all, and a couple of the key tops are missing. The trouble is, he doesn't want to change to Windows 7 as he is easily exasperated when he can't do what he wants. He has used my Windows 7 machine once or twice, under duress, and was frustrated with it. He can see no advantage to switching to Windows 7, other than changing his machine.</em></p> <p><em>His uses are quite mundane \u2013 word processing, web, iPlayer and family photos \u2013 and it really is used as a laptop: ie, on his lap on a couch. Any thoughts?</em><br><strong>Sotires</strong><br><br>Most people who have been using computers for two or three decades have already made larger jumps than the step from Windows XP to Windows 7, which actually requires very little relearning. Your father may have progressed from, for example, a Sinclair Spectrum or Acorn BBC Micro to an Amstrad PCW or to a PC running Microsoft's MS DOS. Even people who have only used Microsoft Windows have seen significant shifts from Windows 3 to Windows 95 (DOS-based) to Windows 2000 and XP (NT-based). Experience shows that it's foolish to try to hang on to the past. Even if you don't want to be an early adopter, you still have to keep moving.</p> <p>In fact, sensible people moved from XP to Windows 7 as quickly as possible. This gave them up to eight years on XP (2001-09) followed by at least six years on Windows 7 (2009-15). As it is, your father has missed the advantages of having Windows 7's increased 64-bit power, greater stability, greater security, much better software for web browsing, email and photos (in Windows Live Essentials), and generally smoother operation for the past three years. And by the time he upgrades, Windows 7 may already have been replaced by Windows 8, which is a much bigger jump than the one he faces now.</p> <p>You can, of course, still buy laptops running XP. These may be second hand, refurbished, or new, but they all suffer from the drawbacks of old hardware. These include much slower processors, too little memory (typically 1GB; rarely 2GB) and tidgy hard drives. Windows XP officially (not literally) was taken off the market on 30 June 2008, so most of these old laptops will be at least five years old. Hardware has advanced on a lot since then, and so has almost everything else. Today's websites, photos and movies are much bigger than they used to be, and you need a lot more processing power to handle them.</p> <p>I did a bit of online window shopping for XP laptops, and I couldn't find anything worth buying at a decent price. Yes, there's plenty of junk in the \u00a3100-\u00a3175 range, but prices of sturdy and reasonably quick XP laptops \u2013 ones that look likely to survive another two or three years \u2013 are not that much cheaper than new ones. Meanwhile, prices of new XP laptops can be higher than Windows 7 machines. You can even find them in the \u00a3600 to \u00a31,500 range, which is crazy.</p> <p>You might find a good second-hand XP laptop locally, but be prepared to haggle over the price. People who paid \u00a31,000 or \u00a31,500 for their old laptop may not appreciate that far better machines are now available brand new for \u00a3250 to \u00a3300, complete with a guarantee. Even if you can pick up a good laptop for \u00a3100-\u00a3150, you may have to install extra memory to reach the minimum 2GB, and the battery will be shot. Worse, you won't know whether or not the hard drive is in good condition, or whether it's riddled with viruses, or spyware.</p> <p>I certainly wouldn't buy any XP laptop unless it came with the correct Windows system disc or an intact recovery partition that can be used to restore the operating software to its factory condition. It must also have a legible <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en/licensing/antipiracy/Pages/COA_hologram.aspx#fbid=lnbM69i96XP\">Windows COA (Certificate of Authenticity)</a> sticker.</p> <p>If you take the second-hand route, aim for a name brand (IBM, Toshiba, Dell etc) business machine with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor from the T or P series, as these tend to be reasonably nippy. Bigger numbers are usually better, and the 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo P8600 Processor used in laptops like the ThinkPad X200 still has legs. In fact, your dad could get a P8600 in a new Dell Latitude E6400 running XP for only <a href=\"http://www.play.com/PC/PCs/4-/15175672/Dell-Latitude-E6400-9842-Intel-Core-2-Duo-P8600-2-4GHz-3GB-200GB-DVD-SM-14-1-inch-Windows-XP-Professional-Laptop-Notebook/Product.html\">\u00a3578.99 from Play.com</a>. However, he could also get a slimline <a href=\"http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/hp-envy-6-1010sa-15-6-ultrabook-14900370-pdt.html\">Core i5-powered Ultrabook</a> for that price.</p> <h2>XP on Windows 7</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396435263\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348150462032/Windows-7-001.jpg\" alt=\"Windows 7\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Windows 7</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are another two options that you could discuss with your dad, if he's willing to bend just a bit. These are to run Windows XP on a new 64-bit Windows 7 laptop, or to make Windows 7 look and (up to a point) work like XP. Unfortunately, both of these need quite a bit of geekery.</p> <p>Like your dad, some slow-moving organisations wanted to stay with Windows XP as long as possible, so Microsoft gave them the option to run a free copy of XP under Windows 7. This requires the use of Windows 7 Professional, not the home version, and a computer with hardware virtualisation technology built into the processor. You will have to check the chip to make sure it offers Intel's VT feature. This means looking it up in the Ark at <a href=\"http://ark.intel.com\">ark.intel.com</a>.</p> <p>With the right kit, go to <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx\">Microsoft.com</a> and download and install a VM (virtual machine) in Windows 7, then download and install Windows XP in this virtual PC. <a href=\"http://windowssecrets.com/top-story/using-windows-7s-xp-mode-step-by-step/\">Windows Secrets</a> and other sites have guides online.</p> <p>It is much cheaper to use the VM than to buy and install a retail copy of Windows XP to replace Windows 7. (The copies of Windows that manufacturers ship with laptops are bought under cheap deals that tie them to the machine on which they are shipped. Your dad can't transfer the copy from his old laptop. Retail copies, which are sold and supported by Microsoft, can be moved.)</p> <p>But perhaps the best idea is to buy a new laptop running Windows 7 and adjust the settings so it looks quite a lot like Windows XP. As always, increasing the resemblance requires an increasing amount of work, but you can start with the simplest option.</p> <p>The next time your dad uses his guest account on your Windows 7 laptop, right-click on the desktop, select Personalize from the bottom of the menu, and select Windows Classic from the set of Basic and High Contrast Themes. This makes Windows 7 look a lot like Windows 98/2000, not like XP, but it could suit your father. (Microsoft provided exactly the same Classic theme in XP to help businesses to adopt it. At the time, people were complaining about having to move to XP, just as they are now complaining about having to move off it. I expect they're the same people.)</p> <p>You can try this yourself. You probably won't like the Windows Classic theme, but you can always switch back to your preferred theme. To make this simpler, save your current theme under a new name and it will appear in the My Themes section.</p> <p>If Classic isn't enough, XP-lovers can download and install <a href=\"http://satukoro.deviantart.com/art/Luna-port-to-Windows-7-Aero-136960235\">an unofficial clone of Microsoft's Luna theme</a> (used in XP) on Windows 7. Since this is not Microsoft signed code, you will also have to install a <a href=\"http://forums.pctweakers.net/showthread.php/102-Universal-Theme-Patcher-for-Windows-7\">a theme patcher</a> as well.</p> <p>To simplify things, someone has put together a 9.4MB <a href=\"http://www.filefactory.com/file/c118b48/n/7_to_XP_pack.rar\">7_to_XP_pack.rar</a> file that contains many of these files. (You will need <a href=\"http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm\">WINrar</a> to unpack it.) There are lots of YouTube videos that show you how to do it, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJIbol1tK94\">this</a> is one of the least bad examples.</p> <p>To make Windows 7 work a bit more like XP, not just look the part, you can also install the <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/classicshell/\">Classic Shell</a> or <a href=\"http://www.csmenu.com/\">CSMenu</a> to bring back the old Start menu. Windows XP proved this worked badly, because it's hard to find anything in dozens of randomly arranged nested menus, and nobody can be bothered to sort them into a proper structure. Vista and Windows 7, by contrast, are search-driven operating systems: you find programs by typing a few letters into the menu's search/run box. (XP users can get the same kind of feature by installing <a href=\"http://www.launchy.net/\">Launchy</a>.)</p> <p>Most of these changes downgrade Windows 7, so they are only for cranky users. However, one that will appeal to most new Windows 7 users is to show hierarchical folder views. To do this, go to Windows Explorer's Tools menu, open the Folder Options property sheet, and click the two check boxes marked \"Show all folders\" and \"Automatically expand to current folder\".</p> <p>To be frank, doing all this involves more time and effort than simply accepting Windows 7 and doing the small amount of relearning required.</p> <p>Perhaps you could convert your dad to this point of view by showing him how to use the menu's search/run box. There must be several things your dad doesn't know how to do in Windows XP, so get him to search for one of those in Windows 7. If not, just type in the word \"change\" and pick an option. Windows 7 provides lots of help and hand-holding, and again, it's usually quicker and easier just to tell Windows 7 what you want than to find it in Windows XP.</p> <p>Windows 7 is, as mentioned, search-driven rather than menu-driven, and it doesn't require you to remember where to find all those minor adjustments that you hardly ever use. This is also true of the web. It's hard to let go of outmoded paradigms, but if your dad plans to outlive Windows 9 (2015), Windows 10 (2018), Windows 11 (2021) and so on, he should start moving now.</p>",
  "<p>What is the matter with this country? The rest of Europe is already close to gender equality in the judiciary and we are dawdling behind. According to a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/sep/20/uk-female-judges-ratio-europe\" title=\"\">Council of Europe (CoE) report</a> published on Thursday, 77% of professional, full-time, judges in England and Wales and 79% in Scotland are men. Only Azerbaijan and Armenia do worse when it comes to appointing women to the bench.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/policy/moj/improving-judicial-diversity-judicial-diversity-taskforce-annual-report\" title=\"\">annual report</a> from its judicial diversity task force the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) pats itself on the back for implementing 20 out of 53 recommendations made by Lady Neuberger in 2010. The MoJ says it aims to have \"a much more diverse judiciary\" by April 2020, but it has not set any targets.</p> <p>The CoE, with <a href=\"http://www.coe.int/aboutCoe/index.asp?page=47pays1europe&amp;l=en\" title=\"\">47 member states</a>, works to promote democracy, the rule of law and human rights in Europe. Its <a href=\"http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/evaluation/2012/Rapport_en.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> on the efficiency and quality of European justice systems says that the gender split among judges works out as 48% women and 52% men for those countries. While the UK struggles to get to a point where a quarter of professional judges are female, 15 other European countries can count more than 50% of women on the bench and some states (Serbia, Slovenia, Latvia and Romania) have more than 70%.</p> <p>Gender is not, of course, the sole concern. The issue is not necessarily the ability of our judiciary to deliver justice, it is that a white male bench does not reflect the general population it serves. Some good work has been done in the last two years to encourage people from a range of professional and social backgrounds to apply to become judges. However, the problem of like recruiting like does not seem to have diminished and progress has been shamefully slow.</p> <p>The MoJ's crime and courts bill, currently making its way through parliament, incorporates suggestions for the introduction of \"tipping-point\" provisions made by a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/mar/28/select-committee-seeks-diverse-judiciary\" title=\"\">House of Lords committee</a> chaired by Baroness Jay earlier this year. That would allow positive action where there are two candidates of equal merit. Commenting on the Lords Report in May Lady Jay said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It is vital that the public have confidence in our judiciary. One aspect of ensuring that confidence is a more diverse judiciary that more fully reflects the wider population. That even by 2011 only 5% of judges were from minority groups and only 22% were women suggest there is still work to be done in this area.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It is important that judges are appointed on merit but the committee felt there are steps that could be taken to promote diversity without undermining that principle. Requiring the lord chancellor and lord chief justice to encourage diversity and supporting flexible working within the judiciary would be a good start. It is also important that solicitors, who are a more representative group of society than barristers, do not face any impediments to a career in the judiciary.\"</p> <p>Thursday's shameful figures suggest there is no time to spare. Vaguely reassuring noises that we will get there in the end are not enough. We deserve a representative judiciary now.</p>",
  "<p>As readers rapidly come to suspect, critics tend to have their prejudices. After a period of exposure to most reviewers, it becomes relatively easy to predict what their broad reaction might be to, for example, a musical or to a new play dealing with religion or American foreign policy. So it is pleasing \u2013 and slightly surprising \u2013 to report that I seem to be overcoming a long-held theatre-going phobia.</p> <p>My strong preference has always been for plays that take place in a theatre and feature words being spoken. This may sound like a political correspondent saying that he enjoys writing about Old Etonians plotting against each other, but there has been an increasing trend in recent years towards site-specific (a show taking place in a car park or even a car) and non-text-based shows, through the work of groups who specialise in \"immersive\" entertainments, including theatre company Punchdrunk and visual art outfits such as Artangel. On a bad day at the Edinburgh or Manchester festivals, there were times when a critic felt dizzy nostalgia at the sight of a seat or a script.</p> <p>This conversion process \u2013 although, like Graham Greene's Catholicism, it is still riddled with doubts \u2013 was completed on Holkham Beach in Norfolk earlier this month. As part of the Norfolk &amp; Norwich festival and London 2012, the American director, Robert Wilson, brought to the British coastline a piece he had previously staged in the Netherlands: <a href=\"http://www.nnfestival.org.uk/festival/outdoor/walking\" title=\"\">Walking</a>.</p> <p>The game of golf was famously described as \"a good walk spoiled\" and Wilson's concept in this piece might be summarised as a pleasant stroll artistically directed. Groups of 19 ticket-holders reported to a hut in the Holkham Beach car park, where we were asked by supervisors in yellow cagoules to \"surrender time to us\", a command translated as the handing over of watches, mobile phones and cameras.</p> <p>At that moment, my pretension-detector \u2013 the device that had always held me back from enjoying theatre of this kind \u2013 started to bleep and was still resounding as we were despatched in single file at 90-second intervals through a field to pass through a darkened room and then stand for several minutes within a willow-fenced enclosure while gazing down into a dark conical hole in the ground.</p> <p>My guess \u2013 the main mental process in textless theatre \u2013 was that this stage represented a detoxification chamber and it seemed to work because my negative feelings about ambulatory site-specific pieces were noticeably fewer as one of the yellow jackets coached us in the agonisingly slow walking pace that we were required to follow during a three-hour trek through meadows, woods and sand-dunes before standing on the beach at Holkham and being lowered on wooden sacrificial slabs into a horizontal position, from which we meditated on sky and sea.</p> <p>As the event ended, the familiar, mocking critical voice cut in, objecting to the frequent bossiness of practitioners such as Wilson (keep in step, and at this pace) and the easy borrowings from meditative religion and rehab. Could this really be called theatre in the way that Mark Rylance in Jez Butterworth's Jerusalem is? And yet, at the time and even now two weeks later, I remember and am affected by Walking \u2013 and especially the way in which it played with the pace of performance and thought \u2013 at a level rare in the majority of text-based shows.</p> <p>On reflection, Wilson's piece completed a transformation in my attitude to the genre that had begun in 2009 with <a href=\"http://www.punchdrunk.org.uk\" title=\"\">Punchdrunk</a>'s collaboration with Adam Curtis and Damon Albarn at the 2009 Manchester International Festival. For <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/it_felt_like_a_kiss/\" title=\"\">It Felt Like a Kiss</a>, Felix Barrett's company took over a multi-storey office block in the city. The viewer walked through a labyrinth of installations, video and live action (an ambush by a running man with a chainsaw) related to paranoia and mind control. The changing of my mind was also helped by two interactive installations curated by <a href=\"www.artangel.org.uk/projects\" title=\"\">Artangel</a>, in which participants also wandered through empty premises filled with spooky interventions: Gregor Schneider's <a href=\"http://www.artangel.org.uk/projects/2004/die_familie_schneider\" title=\"\">Die Familie Schneider</a> (2004) and <a href=\"http://www.artangel.org.uk/projects/2011/locked_room_scenario\" title=\"\">Ryan Gander's Locked Room Scenario</a> (2011).</p> <p>With the zeal of any convert, I now see that the power of this form is that the viewer is in control of the narrative (although this can also happen with clever text pieces such as Martin Crimp's Dealing with Clair and Caryl Churchill's Love and Information) and that the story takes on ambiguities unlikely in a traditional venue. In Wilson's Walking, is that woman with a dog part of the event or just a pet-owner strolling? The climax of Gander's Locked Room Scenario was what at first seemed to be an accidental collision with a pedestrian in the street after leaving the building.</p> <p>My continuing concern about the genre is that many examples of immersive drama and artwork against the idea of a shared experience \u2013 the traditional definition of theatre \u2013 in favour of individual exposure, as if in some humanised videogame. In Walking, each participant was deliberately isolated throughout, while It Felt Like a Kiss, Die Familie Schneider and Locked Room Scenario all required ticket-holders to go in alone. Because of the tiny numbers that can be accommodated, such projects inevitably become elitist. Robert Wilson, though, has got me walking in step at least part of the way.</p>",
  "<p>If you are an economic liberal and a fan of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">single market</a> you may already know about <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/barnier/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">Commissioner Michel Barnier</a>.</p> <p>But did you know he is also the champion of social enterprise in the EU? Barnier's 'slogan': \"There is no economic growth and jobs creation without social entrepreneurship\" launched the <a href=\"https://socialenterprise.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2011/nov/23/europe-financial-crisis-social-business-initiative\" title=\"\">Commission's Social Business Initiative</a> last November and set a timetable for action. The initiative aims to develop an enabling environment for social enterprise across Europe, helping people and communities to unlock their potential and respond to the crisis.</p> <p>A first achievement is the convening of <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/social_business/expert-group/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">an independent group of experts</a> \u2013 called GECES in Brussels-speak \u2013 set up to advise the commission and monitor the policy process.</p> <p>A call for experts opened in May. The process was simple and the group's first meeting took place in June. Breakneck speed for Brussels.</p> <p>Forty eight people were selected. Selected on the basis of expertise, not affiliation which annoyed a few lobbyists, the result is a diverse membership, balanced in gender and geographical provenance, spanning different generations and including practitioners, financiers and academics. <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/social_business/expert-group/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">The experts</a> are complemented by representatives of national governments and other European institutions.</p> <p>But the group is far from being cohesive. On the contrary, it seems Barnier wanted all the parties in the same room. It will not be easy to find agreement as thorny issues rise and different visions clash. The test for me and my fellow members of CEGES is whether we can subsume our differences and get the European Commission to really help this industry which needs better access to finance, more ambition in its potential and a greater recognition by the general public. We certainly don't want this group to end up as another talk-shop.</p> <p>So what are the thorny issues?</p> <p>First up, the definition of social enterprise. This must not get in the way of real action. Practitioners have debated definitions at length and some veterans would like to ring fence the sector and related benefits limiting access to only organisations with a certain legal entity or pseudo-social mission. Setting boundaries is fair, for example corporate social responsibility is outside. Only proven social impact will define what is 'in' or 'out'. The Commission has a firm focus on impact and is initiating work on measurement. It has also launched two research projects to map social enterprises across Europe and identify what economic data is already collected by governments.</p> <p>As part of the definition question, a voluntary label system for social enterprise is being examined by the European Parliament. This is a key action in the 'to do' list of CEGES.</p> <p>Other labels like <a href=\"http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fairtrade</a> are valued by consumers and industry. But does the market want one for social enterprise?</p> <p>Second, follow the money. While the commission wants to increase private investment in social enterprise and the Parliament has approved legislation on a label for social investment funds, the determination of the cap on profits for social investments is still pretty vague and \u20ac50m for an impact investing fund pilot is stuck in the Luxemburg bank account of the European Investment Fund. GECES will discuss these questions at our next meeting scheduled in late November.</p> <p>The solutions are not straightforward but it would be an achievement if GECES got the pilot fund launched by then.</p> <p>The real bonanza may come from the new programme of structural funds such as the <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/esf/\" title=\"\">Social Fund</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/regenerationfunding/europeanregionaldevelopment/\" title=\"\">Regional Development Fund</a> targeting regions with the lowest GDP and totalling \u20ac363 billion for 2014-2020.<strong> </strong>Social enterprise is listed as a priority but has no seat at the table in negotiations between member states and the commission. The start is promising but GECES must ensure that this doesn't get lost in the negotiations of the next 12 months. The commission needs social entrepreneurs to persuade national governments of this spending priority.</p> <p>Third, new law. We wait to see what place social enterprise is given in the text of a second single market act which will be published soon to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the first act. One of the improvements we would like to see is more support for cross border trading. It is not a reality yet for social enterprises.</p> <p>Eurosceptic readers will wonder if the push for social business and setting up the experts group is another Brussels gimmick to woo the public, to distract them from the social crisis and stagnant economy, without any concrete impact on the ground.</p> <p>Yet, for the first time Commissioner Barnier has put social enterprise at the core of European economic strategy. He has until 2014 to prove his commitment is more than words.</p> <p>Besides a new commission and parliament, by then the new European funding programme will start. We will see if the new structural funds support social enterprises; whether an impact assessment system has been adopted by the commission to measure projects and programmes; and if no regulation has been made unless required by practitioners and customers.</p> <p>Then Commissioner Barnier will have passed the test and could even aspire to the presidency of the union.</p> <p><em>Filippo Addarii is the chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/\" title=\"\"><em>Euclid Network</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/news-and-events/sector-news/601-filippo-addarii-selected-for-the-expert-group-for-commissioner-barniers-social-business-initiative.html\" title=\"\"><em>member of GECES</em></a><em>, Commissioner Barnier's expert group on social entrepreneurship.

  "<p>For me there is really only one way to play Fifa: as the manager of a League Two club such as Morecambe and with as much hope of making it to the Champions League as I have of being scouted for Barcelona while doing keep-ups in the garden with an old balloon. I can't play as Man City or Chelsea, or even Swansea or QPR. I need the full heroic narrative. I have to start in the fourth tier, working with players whom I can imagine still make a little extra cash doing roofing for their aunts in the off-season.</p> <p>This has been my routine since at least Fifa 10. I come into a club fighting relegation from the lowest league in the game and, little by little, investing in scouts here, hiring hoary old free agents there, I usher them back up the table and into the next league, and then the next. Until one day, against all odds, several life-weeks and many game-years later, Morecambe are sitting at the top of the Premier League on the final day of the season, preparing to take a shot at being crowned champions of Europe.</p> <p>At this moment in each of the past three years of my life, I have felt an odd mixture of intense pride and crushing regret, an emotional cocktail familiar to gamers everywhere. Luckily, as of Fifa 13, there will be a whole new chapter to the story: at around this moment, the FA will come knocking, asking: \"Would you like to manage the England football team as well?\" To which I, along with every other football gamer in the country, will answer: \"Duh.\" Regret will have to wait until after the World Cup.</p> <p>Of course, every new instalment of a sports franchise needs to offer something that previous versions haven't, and international management, while a welcome addition, is no great revolution. But what sets Fifa 13 apart is that the chance to manage England is just one short item on the very long list of new features worth getting excited about, both on and off the pitch.</p> <p>On it, perhaps the most noticeable is the new first-touch control system. One of the great flaws of past games was watching even the least gifted of players stop a curling crossfield pass at chest-height with a single poke of their boot and jog off with the ball glued to their feet. First-touch control abolishes sticky-boot syndrome. Unskilled players receiving powered passes at full sprint can expect to lose possession a lot. Meanwhile, those who keep control of the ball will find that they have a few more options than in the past: lateral dribbling allows the player to take the ball around defenders without losing sight of the goal, while the new close-control system makes it easier to nutmeg, shimmy and generally showboat your way past the opposing back four. If you prefer to carve them open with a killer pass, you'll find your team-mates now make more intelligent attacking runs, finding space more often, and much earlier.</p> <p>The player-impact engine \u2013 previously capable of some hilarious player pile-ups \u2013 has now got its act together. Its questionable physics looks sorted, and players can jostle for possession when chasing down a pass, giving your defence a more robust and combative feel. Free kicks, too, have had a healthy makeover, and two or three players can now square up behind the ball and make dummy runs, or lay it off for one another to shoot.</p> <p>If you're all about management, you'll find a host of improvements in career mode. Player swaps and cash-plus-player deals add new options to the transfer market, while other clubs no longer sell their best players, and decide who to buy and who to offload far more intelligently. In fact, just about every aspect of the game has got smarter: your own players make sensible requests for game time, showing an awareness of their status in the team, while commentators know much more about your side's position in the league, and read out the latest scores from games being played elsewhere. In short, Fifa 13 looks set to be the most complete and immersive footballing experience yet.</p> <p>It will also make it easier than ever to sign up with Shrewsbury and wake up six months later with a shelf of trophies and a social life in tatters. What's worrying is that this time you might have no regrets at all.</p> <p><em>Fifa 13 is on sale from 27 September.</em></p>",
  "<p>For the first time the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/20/cohabiting-couples-children-report?newsfeed=true\" title=\"Guardian: Cohabiting couples now as likely to have children as those who are married\">proportion of parents who are cohabiting is equal to that of married couples</a>, according to a report commissioned by Co-operative Legal Services.</p> <p>Based on analysis of data from the Office for National Statistics and consumer research, the report shows that over the past decade the number of cohabiting couples with children in the UK has increased by 34% and roughly equals the proportion of married couples with dependent children.</p> <p>In 2011, 38% of cohabiting couples were parents, while in 2010 31% of live births were to women cohabiting with but not married to their partner, up from 25%.</p> <p>But despite the fact that as many people choose to cohabit as to marry, the law still treats both sets of parents differently if they separate or one partner dies. In some cases, parents can find they have few rights to look after or even visit their own children.</p> <p>Christina Blacklaws, director of family law at Co-operative Legal Services, said: \"The law has not kept up and clearly there is confusion about the rights of cohabiting families.</p> <p>\"Although many people still believe they have rights as common law spouses, there is no such status in law. As a result, some cohabiting families may find themselves facing real difficulties should they split up, particularly when there are children involved.\"</p> <p>The research is published to mark the launch of Co-operative Legal Services, which will see the retailer offering a range of products including pre-nuptial and co-habitation agreements, divorces and will-writing.</p> <p>The DIY divorce service will begin at just \u00a399, before VAT and court costs, while a managed divorce service will come in at \u00a3570 before court fees. A co-habitation agreement will cost \u00a3550 plus VAT.</p> <h2>Ongoing imbalance for cohabitees</h2> <p>Despite the Law Commission making recommendations in 2007 that the rights of cohabiting partners upon separation should be increased, little has since been done by the government to rectify the imbalance of the legal situation for married and unmarried couples.</p> <p>As Blacklaws suggests, the law is more complicated when dealing with unmarried couples who are separated \u2013 regardless of how long a couple has been together and devoted themselves to raising a family.</p> <p>The issue of legal parental responsibility is the biggest obstacle for cohabiting parents. This is the right to have a say in your child's education, health and religion, and is accorded without exception to married couples with children.</p> <p>However, unmarried fathers may not have the same rights if they have a child who was born before 1 December 2003 or they are not registered on their child's birth certificate.</p> <p>Fathers in this position can reregister the birth of their child with their name on the birth certificate, sign a formal parental responsibility agreement with the mother or, should these prove difficult for whatever reason, apply to the court with an order to obtain their full legal parental rights in the event of separation or death. Mothers are accorded parental responsibility automatically by law.</p> <p>Children can also factor heavily in other areas when a cohabiting couple chooses to separate. In terms of housing, for example, the home in which the couple cohabited may be transferred under the Children Act 1989 to the parent who is mainly looking after the child, even if the other party had full ownership of this property, to make sure the child is protected and housed.</p> <p>In this case, the home would be only returned to the possession of its owner when the child reaches the age of 18. A cohabiting couple should also be aware that should they split up neither of them will be entitled to financial support from the other, even though they both have a financial responsibility towards their child or children.</p>",
  "<h2>The big story</h2> <p>A violent reality check emerged this week: the moving image still has power to shock and disturb on a global scale. The crude anti-Islamic film Innocence of Muslims \u2013 allegedly a 13-minute trailer for a longer piece, which seems not to exist \u2013 showed that film, for better or worse, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/sep/17/innocence-of-muslims-demonstration-film\">does retain the power to influence world events</a>.</p> <p>The first most people became aware of the film was on (ironically<br>enough) the 11th anniversary of 9/11 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/11/egypt-protest\">when protestors in Egypt beseiged the US embassy</a>; already the story was a news event, rather than a film one. Events soon spiralled, with the<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2012/sep/12/anti-us-protests-libya-egypt\"> death of the US ambassador in Libya</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/13/anti-islamic-film-us-nakoula\">identification of the film-maker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula</a>.</p> <p>As our critic Peter Bradshaw <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/sep/17/innocence-of-muslims-demonstration-film\">pointed out</a>, the instant dissemination afforded by the digital age has only amplified the effect of the film; we still don't know whether calls for restraint will overcome the impulse to wreck.</p> <h2>In the news</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396432778\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348134340599/Keanu-Reeves-2010-005.jpg\" alt=\"Keanu Reeves, 2010\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Back in action \u2026 Keanu Reeves.

  "<p>Students are still not getting the right advice about student finance, according to Martin Lewis, head of the independent task force on student finance information.</p> <p>Speaking on Student Finance Day, which aims to demystify the student loans system, he said misinformation is putting students off university.</p> <p>\"There's too much focus on the headline amount being borrowed \u2014 a mostly irrelevant figure. What really counts is how much needs repaying and that depends solely on what's earned after university.\"</p> <p>He fears \u00a39k fees will put students from poorer backgrounds off higher education. But it's the amount they earn after graduation that dictates how much students repay \u2013 and many will not earn enough during the course of 30 working years to pay their debt back in full.</p> <p>Who will end up paying back the most?</p> <p>Lewis says \"high, but not super-high earners\" will have to cough up most money: \"A graduate with a starting salary of \u00a345k, rising substantially above inflation each year, is probably going to face about the peak repayment.</p> <p>\"If they earn more, then because they're repaying more quickly, the interest has a lesser impact on them. If they earn less than that, for various reasons, they repay less.\"</p> <p>He says that on the whole, those starting university this year have a worse deal than those in previous years \u2013 but it's not all bad news.</p> <p>On the positive side, he says 2012-starters will begin repaying their loans only once they earn \u00a321,000 (compared with \u00a315,795 now) and will make smaller repayments. So they'll have more disposable income, more money in their pocket, more money when it comes to getting a mortage in the early years.</p> <p>\"However, because the amount they borrow is bigger, because there is interest added on top, and because they're repaying less each month, they'll be paying the student loan for longer \u2013 in many cases for their entire 30-year working life.\"</p> <p>Commenting on Student Finance Day, Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, says it's understandable that increased fees are making students think twice about university.</p> <p>But she says nobody should feel their family background excludes them from higher education: \"If you are thinking about going to university, the deciding factor should be whether you feel it is right for you, not your financial circumstances.\"</p> <p>Research done for Student Finance Day suggests that many young people are unsure about the financial costs and benefits of university, with 65% of 14- to 18-year-olds saying they don't think they understand enough about student finance.</p> <p>Lewis says schools should do more to advise students on managing debt and budgeting.</p> <p>\"The biggest problem that students face is that the [maintenance] loan isn't enough. There are places where the rent is bigger than the maximun loan you can get.\"</p> <p>He adds that students should be offered bursaries and scholarships instead of fee waivers (fee discounts), which do nothing to help cash-strapped students.</p> <p>\"Fee waivers will only make a difference to students who will earn high salaries after university \u2013 for many students it won't make a jot of difference. It's a false economy and all it will do is help the Treasury.\"</p> <p>The NUS is already calling for fee waivers lower than 50% to be banned, saying that it is more important to give students the funding they need while they're studying.</p> <p>\u2022 Student Finance Day is held in conjunction with schools and colleges to provide prospective students and their parents with clear information.

Listen here</a></p> <p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Brooklyn.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Russ Manning (vocals, music).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> We've been saying very favourable things about Cascine \u2013 \"a label for experimental pop, guided by intuition\" \u2013 since they started, and although, as with every imprint, the output can be patchy, there is a coherence to their vision, a patina of glossy perfection and minimalist immaculacy, that makes you want to collect everything they do. And that's exactly what we have done, from Chad Valley to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/nov/22/new-band-selebrities\" title=\"\">Selebrities</a>, RXGibbs to Southern Shores. That said, there has been a teensy bit of faking it with some of their releases recently, so it comes as one giant relief to be able to declare Rush Midnight the best thing on Cascine since the sublime <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/14/new-band-jensen-sportag\" title=\"\">Jensen Sportag</a> early last year.</p> <p>Another admission: we totally missed out on George Lewis Jr AKA Twin Shadow, that most <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow\" title=\"\">Pitchfork of artists</a>, and his acclaimed 2010 album Forget (there was recently a follow-up, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/05/twin-shadow-confess-review\" title=\"\">Confess</a>). Well, Russ Manning \u2013 who is Rush Midnight \u2013 has spent the last two years playing bass with Twin Shadow, and now the Brooklyn boy is readying his first release, the +1 EP, said to be inspired by his travels with Lewis across Europe, Brazil and Australia and recorded in hotel rooms and random studios around the world. There are evidently no hard feelings about Manning going solo, because Lewis helped produce two of the tracks on the EP. We can't say whether he has \"Shadow-ised\" the recordings because, to repeat, we dumbly managed to miss out on Twin Shadow entirely, but they are certainly in keeping with the Cascine aesthetic \u2013 which is to say, they are uniformly shiny and feature what would appear to our untrained ear to be highly skilled musicianship.</p> <p>Manning has been described as a \"smooth music provocateur\" \u2013 he is part of that current wave of New MOR-ists that includes Jensen as well as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/apr/01/new-band-destroyer\" title=\"\">Destroyer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/30/new-band-gayngs\" title=\"\">Gayngs</a> who make a virtue out of dexterous bassmanship, synth-y tricksiness and a percussive slickness normally the domain of muso jazz-funkateers (he's a trained jazz musician). Apparently Manning can Do It Live as well because he's playing in Brooklyn next week \u2013 at the <a href=\"http://www.songkick.com/concerts/13731964-splash-at-cameo-gallery\" title=\"\">Cameo Gallery</a> on 28 September, if you happen to be passing \u2013 but we're interested in what he gets up to in the studio.</p> <p>Actually, we already know: it's smooth provocation. The tracks on the +1 EP are sporadically divine. Crush is the best track we've heard all week and confirmation as if it were needed that Cascine's forte is poignant, pristine disco. It is better than anything on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/06/pet-shop-boys-elysium-review\" title=\"\">new Pet Shop Boys album</a>. There, we said it. What We Had (feat Doe Paoro) is our kind of airbrushed candy. Dreaming of an Island is a sorrowful skank, lovers rock for the loveless.

  "<p>The director of public prosecutions is to issue guidelines on when criminal charges should be brought against people posting abusive comments on social media networks.</p> <p>Keir Starmer QC made the announcement on Thursday after revealing that a Welsh footballer who posted a homophobic message about the Olympic divers Tom Daley and Peter Waterfield on Twitter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/20/footballer-tom-daley-tweet\" title=\"\">will not be prosecuted</a>.</p> <p>Starmer said he will launch a public consultation and issue guidelines on how to deal with the daily avalanche of hundreds of millions of comments \u2013 some abusive, some potentially criminal \u2013 posted on social media sites.</p> <p>One of the Crown Prosecution Service's main grounds for concluding that Daniel Thomas, a semi-professional midfielder with Port Talbot Town FC, would not be charged was that his comments, \"however misguided\", were intended to be humorous and not to offend the athletes.</p> <p>That principle, stressing the sender's intention and the online context, reflects a landmark judgment by the court of appeal in July that overturned the conviction of Paul Chambers who had previously been found guilty of sending a menacing tweet about Doncaster airport which he meant to be a joke.</p> <p>Under the Communications Act 2003 it is an offence to send a message using a public electronic communications network if it is \"grossly offensive\".</p> <p>\"The time has come for an informed debate about the boundaries of free speech in an age of social media ... This case is one of a growing number involving the use of social media that the CPS has had to consider. There are likely to be many more,\" Starmer said.</p> <p>\"The recent increase in the use of social media has been profound. It is estimated that on Twitter alone there are 340 million messages sent daily. And the context in which this interactive social media dialogue takes place is quite different to the context in which other communications take place.\"</p> <p>Explaining the decision not to prosecute Daniel Thomas, Starmer said: \"This was, in essence, a one-off offensive Twitter message, intended for family and friends, which made its way into the public domain.</p> <p>\"It was not intended to reach Mr Daley or Mr Waterfield, it was not part of a campaign, it was not intended to incite others and Mr Thomas removed it reasonably swiftly and has expressed remorse.</p> <p>\"Before reaching a final decision in this case, Mr Daley and Mr Waterfield were consulted by the CPS and both indicated that they did not think this case needed a prosecution.\" The message \"was not so grossly offensive that criminal charges need to be brought\".</p> <p>Daley and diving partner Pete Waterfield missed out on a medal at this summer's Olympics when they finished fourth in the 10m synchronised dive.</p> <p>\"Access to social media is ubiquitous and instantaneous. Banter, jokes and offensive comment are commonplace and often spontaneous. Communications intended for a few may reach millions,\" Starmer said.</p> <p>\"Against that background, the CPS has the task of balancing the fundamental right of free speech and the need to prosecute serious wrongdoing on a case by case basis. That often involves very difficult judgment calls and, in the largely uncharted territory of social media, the CPS is proceeding on a case by case basis.\"</p> <p>The DPP said he would be issuing interim guidelines to assist prosecutors in deciding whether criminal action is required and then launching a public consultation with \"campaigners, media lawyers, academics, social media experts and law enforcement bodies\" to ensure that the final guidelines \"are as fully informed as possible\".</p> <p>The problem was also one the police, court services and internet service providers need to confront, Starmer added: \"The fact that offensive remarks may not warrant a full criminal prosecution does not necessarily mean that no action should be taken. In my view, the time has come for an informed debate about the boundaries of free speech in an age of social media.\"</p>",

  "<p>New Zealand was afforded a rare honour on Thursday \u2013 a visit by Leon Panetta, the first American defence secretary to visit the country since Caspar Weinberger back in the cold war days of 1982. But some local inhabitants seem a tad ungrateful. They have labelled Panetta, a former CIA chief, the \"warlord of the world\" and say he should be arrested and sent for trial in The Hague. They pay no heed to Washington's \"anti-China\" Asia-Pacific security agenda.</p> <p>On balance, it always seemed unlikely Panetta would be handcuffed and led away. But he should tread carefully, all the same. New Zealand surprised and deeply angered Washington in the mid-1980s when the government of David Lange famously banned the presence of nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered ships from New Zealand's waters. The Reagan administration retaliated by suspending defence co-operation. The tripartite <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS\" title=\"\">Anzus pact</a> with the US and Australia lost its third leg.</p> <p>New Zealand's independent spirit remains undimmed. But political and security relations with the US have recovered in recent years, driven primarily by Washington's growing focus on Asia-Pacific in general, and China in particular. This has produced some significant joint initiatives, as Robert Ayson, director of the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University, <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10834674\" title=\"\">noted</a>.</p> <p>\"We had the Wellington Declaration in 2010 where the government [of prime minister John Key] and the Obama administration committed themselves to co-operating more in the south Pacific. New Zealand has joined US humanitarian missions in this region. We have also had US marines and army personnel training in New Zealand,\" Ayson wrote.</p> <p>This rapprochement culminated this year with the Washington Declaration on building up a joint maritime security presence and deployable capabilities. Ayson warned: \"We've even said, in language not too far from Anzus, that we are prepared to respond 'in accordance with national approval processes' to regional contingencies. And we don't just mean the Pacific. The canvas is the wider Asia-Pacific region. That means New Zealand is more likely to be seen as a participant in America's rebalancing in Asia.\"</p> <p>This is also how it is seen in Washington. \"The central purpose of the secretary's visit is to explore opportunities for deepening defence co-operation. Following the Washington Declaration, a key area of focus is likely to be maritime military issues in the west Pacific,\" said <a href=\"http://csis.org/publication/defense-secretary-leon-panettas-visit-new-zealand\" title=\"\">a briefing prepared by the Center For Strategic &amp; International Studies</a>.</p> <p>The prospect that, on this basis, New Zealand might one day be drawn into a Sino-American <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/china-japan-dangerous-standoff\" title=\"\">military confrontation over disputed Japanese islands such as the Senkakus</a>, or Taiwan, or North Korea, is alarming to many, and rightly so, for it can hardly be said to serve the national interest. New Zealand's relations with Beijing are cordial and China is its largest trading partner after Australia, said <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10834954\" title=\"\">New Zealand Herald columnist Brian Rudman</a>, so why play Panetta's game?</p> <p>He said: \"Turn off the lights. Hide behind the curtains. Pretend we're visiting sick rellies [relatives] in Sydney. The warlord of the world, Leon Panetta, slips into Auckland this week \u2026 Panetta is here to try and sign New Zealand up to his team trying to encircle and contain the rampant dragon that is China.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"When you look at the devastation that is Iraq and Afghanistan and the upheavals throughout the Muslim world and read of US unmanned Predator and Reaper drone aircraft bombing village wedding parties by remote control, is this a 'friend' or 'valued partner' we really want to get any closer to? We joined them in the Vietnam calamity, and the Afghanistan debacle. Now they want us to join them in putting some sort of corset around China ... It's nice of Panetta to drop in. But the price he asks is too high.\"</p> <p>Panetta travelled to New Zealand after a three-day visit to China, where he toured Chinese warships and gave assurances that Washington wants a non-confrontational relationship based on trust and respect. But commentators point out that as US-China regional rivalry grows, pressure from both countries to take their side in future disputes will inevitably grow, too \u2013 and New Zealand cannot satisfy both. Better in that case to pursue a balanced policy rather than tilting towards Washington.</p> <p>Complaints also persist that the US has not broken a habit of bullying that dates back to the nuclear dispute (the nuclear ban remains in force). While New Zealand took part in recent US-led, 22-country naval exercises off Hawaii, its ships, the Te Kaha and Endeavour, <a href=\"http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/nz-ship-ban-beyond-my-control-us-general-4978359\" title=\"\">were not allowed to berth in Pearl Harbour alongside the other participants</a> \u2013 a painful snub.</p> <p>\"We need to strongly oppose the fact that our government is sucking up to the USA because we are too small to have any great influence and need to preserve our values and our sovereignty,\" said blogger \"Mariana P\" in response to Ayson's article.</p> <p>Some New Zealanders would go further. Another blogger, \"tjh\", wrote: \"Panetta was deeply involved in the illegal Iraq war \u2013 and in the CIA's rendition, torture, and illegal imprisonment activities. He should be arrested the moment he steps on to our soil and referred to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. If we could get Bush and Blair there as well, so much the better.\"</p>",
  "<p>Although nobody would deny Team GB the opportunity to cash in on their hard-won successes this summer, you can't help but wish they'd be a bit pickier. Mo Farah had barely taken his trainers off before he was <a href=\"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02313/moFarahVirgin_2313858b.jpg\" title=\"\">roped in to tool around with Richard Branson</a>. Victoria Pendleton has wasted no time signing up to Strictly Come Dancing, as if the logical follow-up to being a world-class cyclist is seeing whether you can foxtrot better than Johnny Ball.</p> <p>But the most troubling post-Olympic news has only just emerged. It's Tom Daley. You see, he wants to act. Asked about his long-term goals before his big homecoming parade in Plymouth this week, Daley said: \"Film work, I'd love to do anything like that. I would love to try anything new really, be it star in a film or playing a small little part in something like that. That would be pretty cool.\"</p> <p>Tom, no. This isn't what you want. It isn't what anybody wants. Although acting seems like the perfect job for someone like you \u2013 a photogenic youngster already used to the limelight and involved in a profession that involves hanging around for about 90% of the time \u2013 think about it. Think of all the other professional athletes who've managed to become successful actors. It shouldn't take you long, because it's an incredibly short list.</p> <p>The film world is littered with the carcasses of top-flight athletes who, for whatever reason, decided that they could probably act quite well. Think of Pel\u00e9 as Luis Fernandez in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/116717/escape-to-victory\" title=\"\">Escape to Victory</a>. His role was so large that the trailer credited him as third lead behind Sylvester Stallone and Michael Caine, but whenever he was asked to speak he suddenly became a monotonous bore who couldn't finish a single sentence without joylessly chuckling to himself like some sort of village idiot. Or Stan Collymore in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/111397/basic.instinct.2\" title=\"\">Basic Instinct 2</a>: all he had to do was look aroused at Sharon Stone for three minutes and then die, but even then he managed to look woefully unconvincing. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2P9gGElMB4\" title=\"\">Vinnie Jones, perhaps the best known sport-to-acting crossover star</a>, quickly wore out his welcome playing a succession of identical knuckleheads and now spends his days churning out one direct-to-DVD piece of dreck after another.</p> <p>But at least they tried to play other people. To fail at that is noble. Some sportspeople can't even play themselves very well. When Michael Jordan signed up for what basically amounts to an extended cameo in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/34771/space-jam\" title=\"\">Space Jam</a> in 1996, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1lKk5IU4ZE\" title=\"\">he was acted off the screen by a cartoon pig</a>. Even though 1963's <a href=\"http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/344445/Call-Me-Bwana-Movie-Clip-Checking-The-Oil.html\" title=\"\">Call Me Bwana</a> is a low point in Bob Hope's movie career, the brief appearance by Arnold Palmer still manages to be the single worst thing in it. And while all David Beckham had to do in 2005's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/107916\" title=\"\">Goal!</a> was basically listen to people fawn over him, he still managed to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBIZeK-Vleo\" title=\"\">ruin all three of his lines by shaking his head like the dwarf from Don't Look Now</a>.</p> <p>Of course, Tom Daley didn't get where he is today by listening to negativity like this. He's probably busy focusing on the success stories \u2013 like Eric Cantona, who's managed to beat the odds by starring in a series of generally well-received French films. Or OJ Simpson, who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Me8dK_kHmc\" title=\"\">starred in some of the funniest scenes in the Naked Gun series</a> before it all went horribly wrong for him. Or even, at a push, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwayne_Johnson\" title=\"\">The Rock</a>. While arguably not a sportsman in the traditional sense, he has still managed to transcend his discipline and carve out a successful movie career for himself.</p> <p>And yet it still wouldn't be wise for Daley to try and act. He's already one of the best in the world at one thing \u2013 or two, if you count making adult women go all creepy on Twitter \u2013 and to assume he could be just as successful in another smacks of hubris. Maybe it's best if Tom just sticks to what he's good at. Although, having said that, if his alternative career plans involve becoming a pop singer, I'm sure the film-making community will welcome him with open arms.</p>",
  "<p>A man has been arrested in connection with an offensive Facebook page set up following the deaths of police officers Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, Greater Manchester police said.</p> <p>Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said Merseyside police had arrested a 22-year-old man in Netherley, Liverpool under the Communications Act 2003.</p> <p>The arrest is thought to be linked to a Facebook page that appeared to praise Dale Cregan, the man police arrested on suspicion of murder, for his alleged involvement in the killings. It also suggested he should be awarded an OBE. The 22-year-old was in police custody for questioning.</p> <p>Shewan said: \"In the last 48 hours, since the tragic death of our two officers, there has been a huge amount of support from the public through our website and on social media. However, there are also a small number of people who have posted malicious and upsetting comments online, causing outrage to many people and prompting them to ask us what we are doing to deal with these people.\"</p> <p>He said police took reports of this nature very seriously, as demonstrated by the arrest.</p> <p>Shewan said they had become \"very aware of the derogatory and offensive comments\", but the overwhelming message on social media remained one of support.</p> <p>The overwhelming public reaction has been sympathetic to the police. An online book of condolence has attracted more than 25,000 messages from wellwishers. A Facebook page set up by the force has been viewed by more than a million people.</p> <p>On Wednesday night a member of the public set up a Facebook page offering cover so Greater Manchester police officers could attend the funerals of Bone and Hughes. Shewan said he could not thank the public of Greater Manchester and the UK enough for their support and good wishes since Tuesday.</p> <p>Shewan described Tuesday as the worst day in his policing career and said the force was still coming to terms with \"the loss of two wonderful, first-class young officers\". He said it would do everything it could to rid Greater Manchester of organised crime.</p> <p>It would be wrong, he added, to portray Manchester as being in the middle of a gang war. \"This would overestimate what we have got here: clearly two feuding criminal families.\"</p> <p>He said \"enough is enough\", that Tuesday was a watershed moment that had to be the end. Over the last decade, gun crime has fallen in Manchester year on year. The force has witnessed the largest reduction in gun crime anywhere in the UK.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the police dismissed reports that the gun used in Tuesday's shootings had been supplied by Steven Greenoe, an American who was jailed in the US for importing gun components to the UK. Greenoe, of Raleigh, North Carolina, bought the guns in the US, broke them up and hid them in his bags, before travelling to the north-west of England on commercial flights.</p> <p>Earlier, the family and friends of Hughes and Bone <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/20/manchester-police-shootings-families-tribute\" title=\"\">paid tribute to their dedication and commitment to the job</a>.</p> <p>Hughes, 23, and Bone, 32, were shot while responding to a report of a burglary at Abbey Gardens, on the Hattersley estate in Mottram, shortly before 11am on Tuesday. A grenade was also used in the attack.</p> <p>A minute's silence was held in honour of the officers on Wednesday.</p> <p>Theresa May, the home secretary, described the murders as \"savage acts of pure brutality\", and said the victims were \"brave and talented officers who were going about their everyday duties, doing what they do, day in, day out, protecting the public, fighting crime\".</p> <p>Postmortem examinations on the officers concluded that they died as a result of gunshot wounds.</p> <p>Cregan, 29, handed himself in at a police station and was being questioned in connection with four murders: those of Hughes and Bone, and of Mark Short, 23, killed in May, and his father, David, 46, killed on 10 August.</p> <p>Police were granted more time to question Cregan, giving them until Friday morning before he must be charged or released.</p> <p>On Wednesday, a 28-year-old man, who has not been named, was arrested in the Hattersley area on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. He was taken into police custody for questioning.</p>",
  "<p>Who would have imagined that a week after the Hillsborough report we would be feeling very sorry again for the police? The Manchester murders of PCs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/19/manchester-mourns-murdered-pcs\" title=\"\">Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes</a>, both lured into what the city's police chief, Sir Peter Fahy, called a deliberate ambush, raises so many questions that it is hard to know where to start.</p> <p>On Radio 4's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mqq63\" title=\"\">Today programme</a> on Wednesday, Sir Hugh Orde, the former Ulster police chief, now head of the top cops association, struggled to get the right balance even on the very important contempt of court issue. Had Fahy said too much about the case and its background \u2013 even after the arrest of a suspect, Dale Cregan \u2013 to allow a fair trial? Orde said it had been about right in the circumstances, but didn't sound convinced.</p> <p>Murder can't be blamed on politicians, who rarely pull triggers except on shooting galleries. To a degree, social and economic circumstances can. We will learn in due course about the background of anyone convicted in the Manchester case. But politicians and media can be challenged over the way they deal with law enforcement agencies in terms of policy and publicity, structure, management and rewards.</p> <p>David Cameron has called the police the last great unreformed service. He's not the first minister to utter such sentiments since Margaret Thatcher's \"give 'em the money\" approach yielded less than satisfactory outcomes \u2013 as she would have predicted herself with any other public service but the police. But in unleashing reforms of police practices, via the former rail regulator Tom Winsor's controversial <a href=\"http://review.police.uk/documents/police-remun-and-conditions/first-report?view=Binary\" title=\"\">review</a>, and imposing sharp cuts to services, via Theresa May, Cameron is certainly trying to do something about it. Winsor has since been appointed as the first non-police <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18709449\" title=\"\">chief inspector of constabulary</a>. The coppers aren't happy.</p> <p>Looking at Hillsborough and other scandals, we can probably say good luck to Winsor. An outsider may be just what the police need, just as the politicians needed Ipsa to handle their finances and the press needs whatever sensible suggestions Leveson may (or may not) come up with by way of better regulation. And don't forget \u2013 you probably did \u2013 that on 15 November millions of us in England and Wales (not Scotland, Northern Ireland or London) are being invited to elect a local police commissioner to help make the force more responsive.</p> <p>All in all it's a big gamble at a difficult time, which could lead to a perfect law and order storm: disaffected and resentful police being reluctant to co-operate with reform or even to do their law enforcing duty when they feel misunderstood and under-appreciated.</p> <p>This week new guidelines were issued that police \u2013 and other frontline public servants \u2013 will be expected to implement, setting out a wider definition of domestic abuse. We can all follow that train of thought and applaud it, but it does put further strains on public services that are feeling the pressure of rising poverty and unemployment (they do lead to higher crime rates and social breakdown, yes?), not to mention cuts and exotic crime of all kinds, domestic and global. I read that the authorities are unable to claim \u00a31bn worth of assets from convicted professional criminals because the villains thwart the confiscation laws.</p> <p>The Met did not cover itself with glory when responding far too slowly to last summer's riots. Manchester's force did better, now I come to think of it. Yet a \u00a325,000 reward for Cregan \u2013 later doubled \u2013 failed to lead to a single tipoff in the month before his arrest on Tuesday. If people knew where he was but did not report it, was that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/19/police-manchester\" title=\"\">fear of violence</a>, or does it reflect community disdain for the police? We should try to find answers to that, too. Being tough on the right people, on violent career criminals rather than careless motorists or noisy teens, is crucial to the confidence of honest citizens in neighbourhoods rich and poor.</p> <p>We don't want police who stay in their offices or cars, as they do in some countries we could name. Nor do we (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/19/police-shooting-manchester-gun-weapons\" title=\"\">or they</a>) want permanently armed police. That simply raises the aggro and the death rate all round. Nervous young coppers can be as testosterone-fuelled as the criminals they face, and occasionally as capable of reckless misjudgment. But, warts and all, we need them to protect us.</p> <p>On an up-escalator on the London Underground this week, I stood six feet behind three young men who were quarrelling noisily and aggressively between themselves. They looked very volatile. I was nervously braced for trouble, and when one shouted abuse at a man on the down-escalator and the man responded in kind, they raced to the top and chased back down after him. I alerted staff at the ticket barrier, and transport police officers rushed off to investigate. Scary stuff. Rather them than me.</p> <p>\u2022 For legal reasons, this article will not be opened to comments.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/19/police-manchester\" title=\"\">murder of two police officers</a> in Manchester was an extraordinary and shocking event \u2013 and the reaction it provoked was extraordinary too.</p> <p>Watching the press conference by Greater Manchester Police, I was not the only journalist to remark that it looked and sounded more like one held by police in the USA where contempt laws hold no sway in the run-up to a trial.</p> <p>Here, as soon as someone is arrested, no one should publish anything which might cause a substantial risk of <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49/section/14\" title=\"\">serious prejudice or serious impediment</a> to the proceedings that might take place.</p> <p>So what happened in Manchester? I hesitate to repeat some of the statements and interviews carried by TV in the immediate aftermath of this horrific crime because of the very contempt laws I've mentioned. But if a newspaper in isolation had run an article using words like \"lured\" and \"ambush\" and framed them in the way the police did, I think the editor would have been charged with contempt. The remarks appear to be a classic contempt, threatening the suspect's ability to mount a defence.</p> <p>There is no public interest defence in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49/section/14\" title=\"\">Contempt of Court Act 1981</a>. Journalists often make the mistake of thinking that the qualified privilege which attaches to police press conferences is a defence against contempt. It is not, privilege only defends the media from libel.</p> <p>The attorney general Dominic Grieve has been put in a very awkward position \u2013 issuing warnings that he is watching coverage, when the most potentially prejudicial material appears to have emanated from Greater Manchester Police and the prime minister's statement following the killings.</p> <p>It would make for an interesting prosecution if newspapers and broadcasters were held in contempt for reporting information from the police and prime minister.</p> <p>This is not offered as criticism of Greater Manchester Police, they are grieving for the loss of two officers, killed just doing their duty. It is entirely understandable that in the moments following such an event they will react in the same way anyone else would.</p> <p>But what this situation does show is that the Contempt of Court Act \u2013 enacted in 1981, before the internet, before rolling TV news, before social media and smartphones \u2013 is no longer fit for purpose.</p> <p>In a fast-moving situation like the events on Wednesday, when the public are demanding information and reassurance, it is unrealistic to expect contempt to be at the forefront of the minds of police trying to react to such a shocking crime. Nor is it realistic to expect broadcasters covering such a press conference or indeed interviewing the prime minister, to turn off their cameras for fear of prejudicing a trial which will be months away.</p> <p>To then turn to the print media and say they cannot publish what millions have already seen on TV would seem entirely pointless.</p> <p>The Law Commission has started a <a href=\"http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/areas/contempt.htm\" title=\"\">review of this area of law</a>, a public consultation will begin this winter with a report due in 2014. The project acknowledges that this area of law has not kept up with technological change.</p> <p>The permanence and ability to search online news archives also raises the worrying prospect of the media being expected to purge their archives of prejudicial material once someone has been arrested. At the moment the guidance from previous attorney generals has been that archive material can be left untouched, but the media should not actively link to it. It would be a huge task if they had to vet archives for potentially prejudicial material.</p> <p>Fundamentally, contempt law has failed to keep pace with the way people access information. Current contempt laws as they are enforced come down unduly hard on UK-based print media and their websites, while leaving live TV relatively free, and the internet entirely untamed.</p> <p>Dominic Grieve should worry more about what potential jurors are accessing on their phones rather than what fewer and fewer of them are reading in newspapers.</p>",
  "<p>The definition of domestic violence will be amended from March with two important changes: the inclusion of coercive behaviour and the recognition of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/19/teenage-victims-domestic-violence-definition\" title=\"\">16- and 17-year-olds</a> as victims of abuse.</p> <p>These amendments, although they are not a change in criminal law \u2013 as many have assumed - are broadly welcomed. By highlighting coercive control, there is now a clearer focus on patterns of controlling behaviour rather than individual incidents.</p> <p>The inclusion of 16- and 17-year-olds is a much-needed development given that 40% of teenagers report abusive intimate relationships and that, according to the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/science-research/research-statistics/crime/crime-statistics/british-crime-survey/\" title=\"\">Crime Survey for England and Wales</a>, those aged between 16 and 24 are the most at risk of domestic violence of any age group. Hopefully their inclusion will send a strong message to services and young people that their experiences are valid and that they need and deserve support. Young people aged 16 and over are able to get married and may well be parents themselves, yet until now their experiences of abuse have not been officially recognised.</p> <p>However, we must not assume that by changing the definition of domestic violence it will automatically increase their safety. In the last two years, 31% of funding to the domestic and sexual abuse sector has been cut leaving valuable services over-stretched and under-resourced. Many of these services are designed to suit the needs of adults rather than young people and may not be able to respond to any increased demand for support. Young people also have the additional barrier of not always being able to hold tenancies or access housing benefit. At present, an average of 230 women a day are turned away by Women's Aid (representing 9% of those seeking refuge) due to a lack of space. Even if a young woman were able to secure a place, she may not be eligible for housing benefit to to cover the cost of her staying there.</p> <p>Historically many young people have fallen through the gaps between children's services and domestic violence services. It is vital that national guidance is developed to establish who is responsible for responding to young people affected by abuse and that services are supported to deal with the rise in referrals. What would be devastating is if the outcome were simply an increase in the eligibility threshold, once again resulting in young people falling through the gaps.</p> <p>Recent analysis of the Home Office <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/violence-against-women-girls/teenage-relationship-abuse/\" title=\"\">This is Abuse campaign</a> aimed at young people has shown that thousands of young people are experiencing horrific forms of abuse and yet do not always recognise they are being abused, due to a normalisation and worrying acceptability of abuse in society, and especially in their age group. There is also a concerning lack of understanding about what is sexual consent.</p> <p>If the government is serious about protecting and supporting young people at risk, it must do more than announce an amended definition for domestic violence. It must provide appropriate training for practitioners and direct schools to provide sex and relationship education that focuses on equipping young people with an understanding of healthy relationships, consent and how to access help.</p>",
  "<h2>Did Oscar really mean it?</h2> <p>The debate has been raging on Twitter since 8.23pm last night, the moment the Chelsea playmaker curled his beautiful looping shot over the outstretched arm of Gianluigi Buffon. That strike was preceded by what was either an ingenious, imaginative flick between Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Pirlo to set up his devastating second touch, or a miscontrol that just happened to place the ball in the perfect spot for a sharp swivel and shot. Given he's a player that has also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwwCtVyQ8V0&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">scored this unlikely goal</a> in his brief career, we're willing to believe he was well aware of what he was doing. <strong>Mike Adamson</strong></p> <h2>Another Spanish midfielder to behold</h2> <p>After a summer of financial strife, M\u00e1laga put their troubles behind them with a thumping 3-0 win over Zenit St Petersburg in their first ever Champions League match and no one was more impressive than Isco, who scored two wonderful goals either side of half time. The Spanish midfielder also starred in M\u00e1laga's qualifier against Panathinaikos and although he is only 20, he is already comfortable playing at the highest level. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <h2>United could pay the penalty again</h2> <p>The first thing to say is that Manchester United need to master the art of taking penalty kicks. They have now missed all three this season and nobody has stepped forward with any conviction. Sir Alex Ferguson's post-match comments suggested Robin van Persie will be back on penalty duties at Anfield and, just a hunch, but it may be an idea for the Dutchman to put his boot through the ball if he gets the chance to take one. As for the performance against Galatasaray, it was far from convincing and confirmed that Old Trafford has long ceased to be an intimidating place for opponents to come and play. Basel and Benfica sensed United were there for the taking and scored five times between them at Old Trafford last season and Galatasaray could easily have registered a couple of times last night. It was alarming to see how easily the Turkish side opened United up and, with due respect to Galatasary, who played extremely well, a better team would have punished Ferguson's players. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> <h2>A new Paris love affair</h2> <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva and Javier Pastore cost \u20ac105m (\u00a384m) in fees alone in the past 13 months, but they suggested for the first time on Tuesday night that this could come to be money well spent. PSG's first appearance in the Champions League for eight years, a 4-1 thrashing of Dynamo Kyiv, was picture perfect and a massive message to the rest of Europe that this new Qatari-backed super club are absolutely out there as contenders. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> <h2>Celtic need Samaras back</h2> <p>Whoever imagined that fans would despair when Georgios Samaras had an elbow injury? Without his ceaseless running for Celtic that drags defenders out of position Benfica could maintain control on Wedneday. The new loan signing Miku is supposed to have excelled in training but he will do better still for Celtic when markers are distracted by Samaras. <strong>Kevin McCarra</strong></p> <h2>City have defensive work to do</h2> <p>What has happened to Manchester City's defending? In four Premier League games Roberto Mancini's rearguard has failed to achieve a clean sheet, with six goals shipped. Then City arrived at the Bernabeu on Tuesday evening and with four minutes left blew a 2-1 lead and a famous victory over Real Madrid by conceding twice due to the issue that has cost them in other games: allowing space near their area. The penultimate match of the previous campaign is the last time Joe Hart has not had to pick the ball from his net. As Gareth Barry admitted after the Madrid defeat, there is work to do. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <h2>Apoel's lasting legacy</h2> <p>Apoel gave all minnows hope with their surprising run to the quarter-finals last season, which included victories over Lyon, Porto and Zenit St Petersburg. Cluj, from Romania, and BATE Borisov, from Belarus, seem to have been inspired by the Cypriots, winning their opening matches against Braga and Lille respectively to top their groups after matchday one. Cluj should maybe enjoy it while it lasts, however \u2013 they allowed Braga 38 shots and 71% possession in the 90 minutes, their two goals from Rafael Bastos amounting to the perfect smash and grab. <strong>Mike Adamson</strong></p> <h2>The value of taking your time</h2> <p>Few players have the presence of mind to take their time in the heat of the moment but Robert Lewandowksi's late winner for Borussia Dortmund against Ajax neatly demonstrated the importance of allowing yourself an extra second. When the ball dropped to the Polish striker in the box, he could have hit the ball instantly. Instead he waited and deceived his marker with a deft touch to clear the way and then hammered an unstoppable drive home. It's that clarity of thought that sets the top strikers apart. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <h2>What if Abou Diaby could cut out the lapses?</h2> <p>The Arsenal midfielder has a nickname in the press-box and it is pretty self-explanatory. No Grey Areas ran the Montpellier tie, showcasing that heady mixture of power and finesse but he was also booked after 22 seconds, lost possession dangerously to present a golden chance to R\u00e9my Cabella and risked conceding an injury-time penalty. His fitness so far this season has been a tonic to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.

But results both in these high-profile matches and others suggest we're in for a rare group-stage treat over the next two and a half months. The eight favourites for the competition \u2013 Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Chelsea, Juventus and Arsenal \u2013 all either failed to win their opening games or won by just a single goal, offering encouragement that the serene progress the top clubs normally enjoy to the knockout stage may be more bumpy this season. <strong>Mike Adamson</strong></p>",

  "<p>South African rebel Julius Malema was robbed of a platform this week when thousands of Lonmin miners decided to call off their six-week strike, just as he was breathing life back into his political career on the back of their industrial woes.</p> <p>Over the space of a few weeks, Malema had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/18/south-africa-miners-anc-leader-video\" title=\"\">successfully tapped into</a> the anger aroused by the merciless <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2012/aug/23/south-africans-lonmin-mine-memorial-video\" title=\"\">massacre of 34 miners in mid-August</a> by police officers. He heaped scorn on the poor handling of the crisis by President Jacob Zuma, the man who had only recently expelled him from the ruling African National Congress (ANC). Daily, he roamed the platinum and gold belts in the north-west of the country imploring workers to down tools and join their peers in solidarity. He gave them hope and offered the prospect of a socialist South Africa in the near future, urging them to rise up against the white owners of the mines and claim what he believes is rightfully theirs. And they responded with thunderous applause.</p> <p>Malema was in his element. Little more than three months after Zuma cut short his political career, there he was, back on the frontline again, rallying the masses and driving the headlines, with hordes of local and international TV cameras tailing him with the same intensity as they always had.</p> <p>It reminded me of something he once told me in the time I spent with him while researching my book. It was about two years ago and for some reason, which I cannot now recall, he had come within a hair's breadth of the wrath of the ANC.</p> <p>\"They can't get me,\" he laughed heartily. \"I'm the one with the nine lives. They can't bring me down.\"</p> <p>Malema's words ring as true today as they did then. Though he spells doom, if not terror or worse, for many South Africans, he is a locomotive force among millions of dispossessed South Africans. And therein lies the secret of his staying power: Malema is a metaphor for modern South Africa, with its fractured social lines and its divided sense of self.</p> <p>He embodies what Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe refers to as \"lumpen radicalism\": \"a political tradition of unruliness \u2013 and at times resistance \u2013 in which fantasies of male power, control and desire have always been deeply entangled with 'war envy'\". It is the kind of radicalism which is also deeply embedded in millions of South Africans, which is why Malema can relate them with the ease that he does.</p> <p>In many respects, he has picked up where Winnie Madikizela-Mandela left off many years ago. A revolutionary figure in her day, she was fearless and radical and pushed way too close to the edge. Like her, Malema has taken to fanning the flames in townships across the country, hastily reviving the revolutionary tradition as he taps into the racial and social anger that continues to bubble beneath the surface with his war-like talk.</p> <p>It is not surprising that he was quick to make his way to the mining belts last month when violence erupted. It was his perfect storm. For many South Africans, though, it was as if they were gaping at an atrocity all over again.</p> <p>Yet what is often lost in any understanding of Malema's provocation, is the fact that he operates in a country that has infinite political opportunity for a man of his ilk, underpinned as South Africa is by a sophisticated first-world economy but bogged down by the harsh realities of the third world and ruled by an ANC that has got lost in its transition from liberation movement to ruling political party. It was, after all, a failure on the part of Zuma to take control of the recent mining crisis that allowed Malema make his comeback in the manner that he did.</p> <p>The return of the miners to work on Thursday may have left Malema without an immediate cause, but it would be wrong to think we have seen the end of him. With the poorest 20% of the population living off 1.4% of all available income, unemployment teetering around the 40% mark, and a gross dereliction of duty on the part of the ANC leadership, Malema's pickings are as rich as his prospects are healthy. His future is guaranteed. It's South Africa's that appears shaky.</p>",
  "<p>Once you've designed, built and planted your garden you can stand back and enjoy the garden you have created. Unfortunately nature doesn't stand still just because you are. There are the pests you can see: creatures lurking in the corners, and the diseases you can't - fungal infections that blow in on the breeze.</p> <p>Dealing with pests (and I class weeds such as bindweed, ground elder, nettles and brambles as pests too) and diseases in the garden can be problematic. Are synthetic chemicals quicker and better? Sometimes is the answer is yes, but having battled slugs and snails, vine weevils and lily beetles, rust, mildew, blight and pernicious weeds over the years, I am more inclined now to try to tackle the problem as organically as possible. </p> <p>There are a few things that I do apply chemicals to, especially in the garden at the office which I don't have a lot of time to maintain. Bindweed besieges all of the fences, and although I pull it out whenever I see it, I will apply a gel-based weedkiller if I know I won't be able to get into the garden for a week or two. This keeps it at bay long enough for me then to get outside and pull it out when I next have time. If I didn't, it would be six feet up the birch in the blink of an eye. I keep the ground elder under control by pulling it out regularly. It still pushes through but in far less quantity than before and although this approach is a slow one, it does bring a great deal of satisfaction.</p> <p>One of the major destruction foes in the garden are the molluscs; slugs and snails can turn a hosta leaf into a doily over night. Whatever approach you take here isn't pleasant. Slug pellets aren't great and need refreshing often, especially after rain. Slug Clear, a liquid based systemic killer, is more efficient: it has no surface trace the way pellets do and so seems safer when children and pets use the garden. Both of these aren't in the least bit organic though. If you prefer a more natural approach, scooped-out citrus fruit halves filled with beer set into a hollow in the soil at least provide a \"happy\" end. </p> <p>Copper mats and rings repel slugs and snails, or you could simply go out when the molluscs are most active at night and collect them and repatriate them well away from your garden (and everyone else's \u2013 you won't be popular if you spread them to your neighbours). But be warned: slugs and snails can travel further than you think and may well reappear. Nematodes, tiny parasites that attack slugs and snails (and other pests too) are an option if watered on early enough. April is a good time, as long as the weather is warm enough and <a href=\"http://www.nemasysinfo.co.uk\">nemasysinfo.co.uk</a> has an amazing array of creatures that pray on pests as well as very helpful advice. The <a href=\"http://www.rhs.org.uk\">Royal Horticultural Society website</a>, contains a wealth of knowledge both for organic and non-organic solutions. And remember - your pest is another animal's food. Hedgehogs and birds will feast on all manner of pests, so if you can go without chemicals you will increase the chance of encouraging wildlife into your garden to feed.</p> <p>Airborne fungal diseases are another matter and this year box blight (Cylindrocladium blight) has been a real problem. The wet weather has worsened the spread of the disease and since there is no real control; the only things you can do are to keep the plants immaculate; clear up any fallen leaves, make sure the ground around the plant is well drained and keep the plant fed. Some plants will recover if and when the weather improves: <em><a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1193\">Lonicera pileata</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilex_crenata\">Ilex crenata</a></em> are good substitutes and are not affected by blight.</p> <p>All forms of mildew, black spot and rust can also me controlled with good husbandry, as can lily beetle and vine weevil. If you know the signs, you can avert the problem before it becomes too serious. Look for square notches on the edges of leaves that mean vine weevil are present (Rhododendron, Heuchera and Sedum are particular favourites) and douse the roots with nematodes. Lily beetles don't do themselves many favours in the camouflage department and their scarlet bodies can be seen from a distance from spring to autumn. Their larvae are terribly destructive and have really unpleasant characteristics (<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/marijnrongen/5709643783/\">covering themselves with their own excrement</a>, to be precise) which makes the most effective organic control of hand picking them off your lilies - a job that definitely requires gloves. </p> <p>It has been simple in years past to head straight to the shed for a can of something deadly whenever a plant was besieged in the garden, but in my experience the slow approach can be equally as effective. And you are safe in the knowledge that you know what you are putting on your plants and in the ground and, in the long term, what you are exposing yourself to.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.kategouldgardens.com/\">Kate Gould</a> is an award-winning garden designer and a regular exhibitor at the Chelsea Flower Show.

Voters may not absorb the administrative detail of a \"reform\" the chief executive of the NHS said was visible from Mars, but one thing they know: Cameron promised during the 2010 election not to cut or privatise the NHS. Those will be principal \u2013 and perilous \u2013 themes into the next election.<br>At the 2010 Tory party conference, Francis Maude said the government was relaxed about creating a postcode lottery for healthcare and other services, and that is precisely what results from the \"reforms\" now in place: as the state is rolled back, there can be no national standards. The public always strongly resents any suggestion they can get a drug or treatment in one place, but not another. New evidence emerges of the centrality of mental health, and how switching resources to psychological services could save large sums from physical healthcare budgets. But that would mean a central initiative, with the capacity to steer and reallocate. In opposition Cameron derided Labour's targets but has sought to reimpose the same 18-week maximum wait for surgery \u2013 demonstrating how often he finds centralism essential when faced with the consequences of the anarchy that characterises his competition policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Disability campaigner <strong>Adam Lotun</strong>, who is <a href=\"http://adamlotun.org.uk/\" title=\"\">standing in the Corby byelection</a>.

Blogger Johnny Void, following the work and pensions secretary's appearance before a committee of MPs, says \"it's becoming near impossible to keep up\". His blog, the Void, had earlier this week reported on a warning by charity Women's Aid that Universal Credit and benefit caps <a href=\"http://johnnyvoid.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/every-womens-refuge-in-the-uk-could-close-due-to-universal-credit/\" title=\"\">could lead to every single women's refuge is the UK closing their doors</a>. But in a later post, said Duncan Smith and welfare reform minister Lord Freud <a href=\"http://johnnyvoid.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/iain-duncan-smith-fudges-on-womens-refuge-closures/\" title=\"\">hinted at a partial climbdown</a> when they appeared before the work and pensions select committee. Void writes:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are wobbles on direct payments which mean that housing payments will no longer be sent straight to social landlords but instead land in the bank account of even the most vulnerable tenants. Once again however there is no real details, merely some mumbles that some people may be taken out of this regime. How these people will be identified by the faceless computer based system which underpins the new 'digital by default' benefit system has not been explained.<br>It's clear that Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Fraud are making it up as they go along. If they weren't being paid billions of our money you might almost feel sorry for the poor bastards designing the new labyrinthine computer system which Universal Credit will depend on. Almost everyday Iain Duncan Smith moves the goal posts or adds new layers of complexity to the project which is already running behind schedule and over budget.<br>What is truly terrifying is that these problems are only just occurring to to the out of touch millionaires at the DWP. Almost any housing or social worker could have warned them about the problems which will face refuges and homeless hostels when Universal Credit goes ahead. Iain Duncan Smith has spent years plotting welfare reform yet even now he doesn't seem to have any understanding of how the system he's reforming actually works.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19649306\" title=\"\">Poor pupils 'lose out on funding'</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074685/youth-offending-teams-lose-800-posts\" title=\"\">Youth offending teams lose more than 800 posts</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/13396/micro_finance_is_not_risk-free_study_concludes\" title=\"\">Micro-finance can make the poorest poorer, study warns</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2012/09/19/118538/mid-staffordshire-inquiry-report-delayed-until-next-year.html\" title=\"\">Mid Staffordshire inquiry report delayed until next year</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-bristol-pound-is-launched-to-help-independent-retailers-8157379.html\" title=\"\">The Bristol Pound is launched to help independent retailers</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/development/campaigners-force-judicial-review-of-hmr-fund/6523812.article\" title=\"\">Campaigners force judicial review of HMR fund</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106969\" title=\"\">Study warns elderly are excluded from decision making</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/pickles-confirms-newman-as-audit-commission-chair/\" title=\"\">Pickles confirms Newman as Audit Commission chair</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9554790/Maternity-units-must-be-closed-to-make-childbirth-safer-report-says.html\" title=\"\">Maternity units must be closed to make childbirth safer, report says</a></p> <p>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Acevo and Navca want more joint working between small and large charities</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",

The finishing touches are now being padded by studio co-chair Donna Langley.</p> <p>Based on the Japanese legend in which a group of early 18th-century samurai avenge the death of their master, the Hollywood version adds fantasy elements such as giants and witches into the mix.

A number of studio-ordered reshoots took place in the UK a week ago, allowing Reeves to play his part in the denouement and also adding a love scene, close-ups and extra dialogue to restore him to the centre of the action. The film now finishes with a battle between Reeves' Kai and a supernatural monster.</p> <p>Aside from Reeves, 47 Ronin features a largely Japanese cast, so US audiences could have been perplexed by his absence from the end of the movie. The 3D epic is the first starring role for the Canadian actor in a big budget Hollywood production since the final Matrix instalment in 2003.</p> <p>The Wrap claims Rinsch would have been removed as director of the film prior to the reshoots were it not for a Director's Guild of America rule. Universal has denied suggestions it will now cost $225m.</p> <p>The true \u2013 though much-embellished \u2013 story of the 47 Ronin is considered Japan's national myth: a parable of loyalty, sacrifice and persistence which is perhaps the most famous case to involve the samurai code of honour, bushido. The group of samurai became leaderless warriors \u2013 ronin \u2013 after their master was forced to kill himself by court official Kira Yoshinaka; the warriors waited a year before they mounted their attack on 14 December 1702, murdered Yoshinaka, turned themselves in and then themselves committed ritual suicide.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABshingura\" title=\"\">Ch\u016bshingura</a>, or Treasury of Loyal Retainers, a 1748 play by Takeda Izumo based on the story, has been adapted for the big screen on six separate occasions in Japan. Western audiences will probably be most familiar with Hiroshi Inagaki's 1962 version, released in the US as 47 Samurai, which starred Toshiro Mifune.</p> <p>The film is just the latest Hollywood blockbuster to run into trouble this year.

  "<p>It's easy to tell when the new Pro Evo is due: I've just about mastered the previous one.</p> <p>It's probably best to start with a confession. Just like certain allegiances \u2013 politics, football teams, that friend your wife really doesn't like \u2013 defy all logic, so is my love for PES. There have been years I've flirted with Fifa and yes, grudgingly, I must admire its glossy appearance, official licenses, player animations and clever touches. But it's a dalliance and it's PES that I'll return home to.</p> <p>You can take the mick all you like (and with teams such as Merseyside Red and West Midlands Village there's more than enough material), you can argue that the old Fifa complaints \u2013 it's too easy / it's all about the glory goals \u2013 no longer hold water. When it comes to repeat play, you're still more likely to find me grinding out the results in PES than any other game.</p> <p>It'll be over to Keith in due course to present the case for Fifa 2013. This week you've got me and my attempts to judge PES 2013 fairly (which I'm sure will be analysed and pulled apart in the boxes below in a just a few seconds' time).</p> <p>So, let's start with that four-out-of-five score. If we did marks out of 10 or offered halves, this would be a 70% title or thereabouts so, given my allegiance (and general glass-half-full take on life) I'm rounding up. Sue me.</p> <p>In truth, there's a lot to back up the score. This incarnation of PES feels more solid than the past few years, particularly in defence, where new touches such as shadowing and simple face-on tackles mean you don't always have to slide in and risk yellow cards and the console's team somehow bursting the net with a 45-yard free kick that you will never replicate.</p> <p>As for the bells and whistles, there are some excellent additions. There's a full range of passing available and shooting is more controlled than ever \u2013 the duration of the respective button press controlling height and power. And the new tricks \u2013 flick ons, instant control, turning defenders \u2013 are very welcome.</p> <p>There is a full training module available which you will need: these moves require a lot of practice to drop them into a full game (and the sort of manual dexterity that occasionally feels like you're playing Pro Evolution Stenographer) but when they come off, and you've fizzed a ball across the pitch, flicked the ball over a defender and embarked on a mazy run finishing with a carefully placed chip into the top corner, you'll punch the air.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396419887\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348138061750/PES-2013-008.jpg\" alt=\"PES 2013\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PES 2013</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or the wall when you've pressed the wrong button, hit a shot that's closer to the corner flag, got the timing all wrong, conceded the winning goal with the last kick of the game or just feel that the console has deliberately ignored your button pressing (yes, it's a thing).</p> <p>It would be interesting to see a Top 10 of games that have resulted in controller flinging and property damage; I suspect that PES would be high on the list. Sometimes you can play brilliantly and lose. Sometimes you can go from being a master of the button presses to getting it all wrong \u2013 Messi to messy \u2013 in the space of a few seconds. But hey, that's football.</p> <p>A big change is the lack of league competitions, but that's pretty much taken care of under the positively tweaked Master League function. There's also some new music and new commentary but not enough of either that they won't get very annoying very quickly.</p> <p>Graphically, things have improved with some impressive player likenesses, particularly in their movements. Konami claims to have improved the goalkeeping too. Hmm. On the evidence of the many games played so far, if they have worked with real keepers it appears to have involved Heurelho Gomes.</p> <p>Once again, the late transfers aren't reflected in the game, and will require a data download (or not if you're a Tottenham \u2013 sorry, North East London \u2013 fan eager to hold on to Modric for another season) although that wasn't available at the time of review.</p> <p>Is this the Pro Evo to convince Fifa fans to switch? No. Is it an improvement on the last couple of years' PES incarnations? Yes. Will I be loving it and hating it and still playing it until PES 2014 comes out? Absolutely.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on PlayStation 3</strong></p>",
  "<p>A new smartphone app that listens for the distinctive call of a highly endangered insect will soon help conservationists find out whether it has become extinct or not. The unusual blend of crowdsourcing and conservation is part of <a href=\"http://www.newforestcicada.org/\">an experiment to see if visiting tourists using the app</a> can help in the scientific hunt for the New Forest cicada.</p> <p><em>Cicadetta montana</em> are native to Britain, but have not been spotted or heard from in more than a decade, says <a href=\"http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/acr/\" title=\"\">Alex Rogers</a>, a researcher at the Electronics and Computer Science group at the University of Southampton. One possible reason for this is their high-pitched love song is on the very upper limit of an adult human's hearing range, between 13-14 kHz. \"It's so very high pitched you're never quite sure you're hearing it,\" he says.</p> <p>The average smartphone, on the other hand, is quite capable of picking up such frequencies. So Rogers and colleagues are developing software that will turn one of these devices into a portable cicada detector. Visitors to the New Forest \u2013 situated mostly in Hampshire \u2013 will be able to download the app and then scour the area holding their phones aloft in search of the elusive creatures. Or when the novelty wears off the app should still work in the background from someone's pocket or bag, says Rogers.</p> <p>The app will also be able to detect a number of other insect species, such as Roesel's bush crickets, wood crickets and the common grasshopper, but the real prize will be the cicada. With 13 million people visiting the <a href=\"http://www.thenewforest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">New Forest</a> each year, the hope is that enough of them will take part to carry out a comprehensive survey, with thousands of amateurs covering far more ground that a handful of professionals could ever hope for.</p> <p>And if they do detect a song? \"The app would give them immediate feedback that it thinks that a cicada has been detected,\" says Rogers. It will then ask for their permission to upload the recording to a server so it can be analysed in more detail. \"Rediscovering the New Forest cicada would be quite a big deal so we'd then contact them off-line and investigate the sighting, revisiting to the site to get more recordings,\" says Rogers.</p> <p>\"The decline in numbers of New Forest cicadas are unclear,\" says Jim Mitchell of New Forest Parks Authority, but possible reasons are the reduction in woodland coppicing and other forestry practices. Still, despite such a long absence there is still good reason to keep looking. One is that they can remain dormant underground for years at a time. They lay their eggs in the stems of trees and shrubs and when the larvae emerge they fall to the ground and live underground feeding on root sap for years at a time, said Mitchell. Indeed between 1941 and 1961 there were no sightings at all, so there is still hope.</p> <p>Having first tested the software on the utterances of an electronic cicada, Rogers and colleagues took to the field, testing it on live cicadas in Slovenia earlier this year.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine it: David Cameron wants to see you. You go to his office. He seems jolly enough and keeps telling you what a good job you've been doing, but a few minutes later you're standing on the pavement with all your stuff in a box. Have you just been fired?</p> <p>If you think it's an easy question to answer, consider the case of Lord Hill, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/shortcuts/2012/sep/17/minister-quit-lord-hill\" title=\"\">decided to resign as education minister</a>. After several cancellations he finally got a meeting with the prime minister, but Cameron was so distracted he didn't understand \u2013 he told Lord Hill to keep up the good work and left for a photo op. The meeting ended inconclusively, with Lord Hill still very much in his job. In fact, he's still in his job; he even survived the reshuffle. Now, if you can't tell whether you've quit or not, how will you know when you've been fired? Fortunately, we can offer ministers this handy checklist:</p> <h2>Have you been sent to the front door, or the back?</h2> <p>According to an anonymous ex-minister who produced an <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/09/sacked-minister-spills-the-reshuffle-beans/\" title=\"\">account of his sacking for the Spectator</a>, being directed to the rear entrance of Number 10 is a sure sign your cards have been marked, even if the PM tells you it's because there are workmen out front. It's more likely he's trying to keep your freshly crestfallen countenance away from the cameras. He's doing you a favour, really.</p> <h2>Is everyone being unusually nice to you?</h2> <p>Another clue. The ex-minister first became suspicious when Cameron's flunkies, normally stand-offish, were \"eerily fawning.\" After the meeting, they'd all disappeared.</p> <h2>Is the PM drinking wine?</h2> <p>He was when he sacked Cheryl Gillan, his former Welsh secretary, <a href=\"http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/politics/joseph-watts/new_details_of_the_reshuffle_sackings_1_1507405\" title=\"\">according to one political blog</a>. Downing Street has denied this, but it's definitely a clue worth looking out for. If you had to fire a load of people, you'd probably drink, too.</p> <h2>Did the PM tell you you're too old?</h2> <p>Apparently he told Caroline Spelman <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/09/06/david-cameron-drank-wine-spelman-to-old-reshuffe_n_1861087.html\" title=\"\">she was too old</a> \u2013 at 54 \u2013 to carry on as environment secretary, before replacing her with Owen Paterson, 56. So clearly it wasn't the real reason; perhaps it was just the nicest thing he could think to say.</p> <h2>Is he going on and on about all the people he's got to please?</h2> <p>Cameron told the Speccie's anonymous ex-minister: \"There's actually 303 someone elses and I've got to keep them all satisfied.\" If you haven't made the PM's \"Top 303 People I Must Keep Satisfied\" list, chances are you're history.</p> <h2>Does your name still appear on the departmental website?</h2> <p>If you've been fired, your name will be removed within hours, if not minutes. The same goes for your office door, so check that too. If you can still get past security.</p> <h2>Have you been left feeling bemused, hurt, depressed and unsure what to do next?</h2> <p>Don't panic: you may still be employed. Remember Lord Hill.</p>",
  "<p>Cycling safety campaigners have welcomed the support of Team GB's Olympic gold medallists.</p> <p>Track champions Victoria Pendleton, Dani King, Joanna Rowsell and Jason Kenny this week called for better cycling infrastructure on Britain's roads.</p> <p>Pendleton called for cars to be banned from parking or driving in cycle lanes, while King and Rowsell said the UK should follow the example of Holland where cyclists are given priority at junctions and roundabouts.</p> <p>Kenny said if more people took to their bikes, it would make cycling safer.</p> <p>The Olympians, who won a total of five gold medals in the velodrome this summer, were speaking in support of the <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/cyclesafety/\" title=\"\">Times' Save Our Cyclists campaign</a>.</p> <p>The UK's national campaign group, <a href=\"http://beta.ctc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the CTC</a>, welcomed the comments, but expressed fears that while the Olympic afterglow has seen a surge in the number of cyclists, motorists continued to display \"basic bad driving habits\".</p> <p>CTC spokesman Chris Peck said:</p> <blockquote> \"It's great to have the support of the Olympic champions. It comes at a time when there is worrying evidence that the risks for all road users, not just cyclists, are getting higher. A lot of this is down to the fact there has been a 30% fall in road traffic policing in the last 10 years. Fewer drivers are getting caught or disqualified for traffic offences, and when people know they are unlikely to get caught, it encourages bad habits such as using their mobiles or overtaking too close to cyclists.\" </blockquote> <p>Peck said it wasn't a case of \"us against them\", pointing out that \"more cyclists own or drive cars than non-cyclists\".</p> <p>Pendleton, who won Olympic gold in the keirin and silver in the individual sprint, told the Times:</p> <blockquote> \"When people overtake you on corners or give you three inches of space when overtaking, I often think, 'If you knock me off and I die, how would you feel about that, if I was dead? What if you killed me when I've spent my whole life training for the Olympics and it's over because you couldn't wait for three or four more seconds?' It would be <br>a lifetime of work over.\" </blockquote> <p>Peck backed Pendleton's concerns, saying:</p> <blockquote> \"The Highway Code states clearly you should give as much room to a cyclist as you would give a car when overtaking. But drivers aren't doing this. We need better policing and law enforcement to improve drivers' behaviour.\" </blockquote> <p>The lack of policing of bad drivers is in direct contrast to police clamping down on cyclists. It <a href=\"http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1588902_hundreds-fined-as-police-launch-crackdown-on-pavement-cyclists\" title=\"\">was reported this week</a> that 14 cyclists were taken to court in Greater Manchester last year for riding on pavements. Hundreds more received \u00a330 fixed penalty fines, included an 84-year-old great-grandfather.</p> <p>Cycle training provider <a href=\"http://www.bikeright.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bike Right!</a> believes both cyclists and motorists need better education. Spokesman Andy Tucker said:</p> <blockquote> \"Everything that Victoria Pendleton and the other Olympic cyclists say about infrastructure and driver training is spot on. But the total funding pot for a training scheme like Bikeability in this school year is \u00a311m, which is about the same cost as one mile of single carriageway. <br> \"Driver training for heavy goods vehicle (HGV) and public service vehicles (PSV) is starting to include cyclist awareness modules, but it's not compulsory. Our view is that a balanced mix of capital expenditure in infrastructure improvements and appropriate training for all road users will both increase the number of cyclists on the roads and ensure their continued safety.\" </blockquote> <p>Rowsell and King, who won Olympic gold in the team pursuit, did a lot of their training in Belgium and Holland. Rowsell told the Times:</p> <p>\"They have wide cycle lanes and the cyclist doesn't have to give way \u2013 they are treated as another member of road traffic.\" And King added: \"You don't get beeped as much and you feel really safe.\"</p> <p>Kenny, who won double gold in the velodrome, said: \"Bike lanes are nice to get you away from the traffic. I prefer ones that don't make you get off and on again. I think the more people that ride, the better.\"</p> <p>Peck from the CTC said this was a crucial point:</p> <blockquote> \"If more of us got on our bikes, there would be safety in numbers, drivers would be forced to become more aware of us. It's a fact that in countries with lots of regular cyclists, such as Holland and northern Belgium, the risks are far less. <br> \"It's hugely helpful to have the Olympians' support at this time, as it's a key moment for cyclists. The government will soon be announcing a national transport policy, and we are working with British Cycling, Sustrans and other partners to influence MPs to make sure cyclists get their fair share of attention.\" </blockquote>",
  "<p><strong>What inspired you to write this parallel Moby-Dick?</strong></p> <p>A silly joke. The joke of Moby-Dick, except with moles instead of whales. I thought of that, and it made me laugh. Of course there's nothing new about retelling Moby-Dick with other beasts - there have been dragon Moby-Dicks, dust monster Moby-Dicks, flying monster Moby-Dicks, etc etc. I liked the idea of the mole, though, because moles are such lovely and - in my head - adorable animals, and the necessary translation or mistranslation of them into what I wanted - enormous, astounding, epic terrors - was a big ask, which I thought might be enjoyable. For me, though, though I don't mind pegging a story on a joke, having decided to write it, I want to treat it as seriously as possible, So while I hope there are genuinely funny bits in the book, I didn't want to make the whole thing just a gag, I wanted to quickly forget how absurd the idea was - though it is absurd and that was part of the whole point - and start to treat it as if it was epic. That's a game I enjoy. I also didn't want to write something that was just a parallel - I know some people like them, but I don't overmuch enjoy stories that exactly point-for-point retell other stories. So I knew I wanted Moby-Dick to be a peg, an inspiration, a riff, an echo, but for my story to wander off and do very different things. (Visiting Robert Louis Stevenson, Daniel Defoe, Joan Aiken, and lots of other writers on the way.)</p> <p><strong>Which character from Railsea do you identify most with?</strong></p> <p>The one I would most like to be like is Caldera. The one I fear I am most like is Sham at the start. </p> <p><strong>If you could be trapped on a desert island in the middle of the Railsea, with any of the characters, who would you choose and why? Personally, I would choose to be trapped with the twins, Caldera and Caldero, because they are resourceful and determined, while are also likely to be able to fashion together some sort of craft out of salvage, using the skills their parents taught them, allowing us to escape.</strong></p> <p>I think your answer is very persuasive. For overlapping reasons, I would probably choose Sirocco. She is not as admirable or as inventive as the Shroakes, but I like her swagger, and I think she would be entertainingly foul-mouthed if annoyed.</p> <p><strong>On p8 of Railsea you write, \"Lights winked in her bulky, composite left arm. It's metal &amp; ivory clicked &amp; twitched\". Was Railsea influenced by the steampunk movement and was it your intention to appeal to a steampunk audience or was it merely coincidence?</strong></p> <p>I'm sure the book was influenced by steampunk, but at least at a conscious level I wanted it very much not to be a steampunk book. It is no coincidence that the train itself is not a steam train. That there are electric trains, hand-powered trains, and so on, as well as the now culturally ubiquitous steam-engines. I wanted it to be a world in which there was more of a patchwork of technology than a Victorian-era level of technology, even a fantasticated and imaginary one. I like to think of this as a salvagepunk book, rather than a steampunk one. </p> <p><strong>In Railsea, on page 143, you explore \"&amp;\", and its relationship with the Railsea itself. What inspired you to include this? Why did you wait until Chapter 33 to explain why you used the symbol &amp; instead of the word \"and\"?</strong></p> <p>I love ampersands, which is the utterly beautiful name for those utterly beautiful \"&amp;\" signs, and I always have. I love their sweep and height, I love that such a tiny word has such a splendidly rococo alternative, I like everything about them. In addition, I associate them with 18th century maritime narratives - in my mind, ships logs from that time use them in big ink swirls - which I wanted my story to echo off, so it seemed a perfect excuse to use them. I put the \"explanation\" in later, rather than earlier, because I sort of vaguely felt like I knew it might annoy some readers to use the &amp; all the way through, and that to jump in too quickly with an explanation might feel a bit like I was saying \"Look! It's ok! I have a reason! Don't go away!\" which felt a little bit cowardly. I'd rather keep people interested, if I can, even despite their eyes twitching a little at the &amp;-signs (which not everyone's does, of course, some people love them or don't care), and then have an explanation when they've already surrendered to the ampersand. </p> <p><strong>On a recent visit to a 16th century house called East Riddlesdon Hall, I found an early Victorian child's sampler that used the ampersand (&amp;) as a full stop. Have you ever come across this before and do you have any idea why they might have done this?</strong></p> <p>I have never heard of this, and I am quite fascinated. And troubled: my typographical philosophy is being shaken. </p> <p><strong>Within Un Lun Dun, you acknowledge the fact that Neil Gaiman's book, Neverwhere gave you \"indispensable contributions to London's phantasmagoria\". Are there any other specific books \"indispensable\" to the writing of both Un Lun Dun and Railsea?</strong></p> <p>So very many I don't know where to start. Lewis Carroll's Alice books, Joan Aiken's books, especially The Wolves of Willoughby Chase and The Whispering Mountain, Alan Garner's astonishing books, Michael de Larrabeiti's Borrible trilogy, Ivor Cutler and Helen Oxenbury's Meal One, Norton Juster's Phantom Tollbooth, Enid Blyton's Faraway Tree books (for all that they make me wince, now), Else Holmelund Minarik's A Kiss for Little Bear (with Sendak's illustrations), the books of Jan Pienkowski, Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea books, Tanith Lee's Prince on a White Horse, so...</p> <p><strong>Was it your intention to write a story similar to Neverwhere, but suitable for younger children?</strong></p> <p>With Un Lun Dun? Not deliberately. I think Neverwhere stands quite outstandingly enough on its own that to write a \"version\" of it would be disastrous! I started writing Un Lun Dun before I'd actually read Neverwhere, but when I did read it I realised of course there were strong echoes. I see echoes with lots of books in all my books, some deliberate, some unconscious until later, and as long as that is respectful I think that's great - writing on the shoulders of other writers is a privilege. </p> <p><strong>Did you severely alter your writing style to make your work appeal to children?</strong></p> <p>Not exactly. Every book I write, the first thing I have to do is get into the voice, and the voice varies from book to book - that's part of what's interesting to me. So the voices between, say, Kraken and Embassytown (two of my \"adult\" books) I think varies considerably, and similarly the voice between Un Lun Dun and Railsea. Of course, who you're writing for is part of the decision about the voice of the book, so to that extent, yes, sort of - but the person you're writing for is (sorry to repeat what is a cliche, but it's true) yourself - though yourself at different times and in different moods. So when I wrote Railsea, I was very much wanting to write a story for myself at a certain age. I tried to inhabit the voice that would excite and win over and appeal to and interest that me, rather than thinking \"now to write to appeal to children\". I wouldn't know how - but I do know how to tell younger-me a story he would like, I think and hope. </p> <p><strong>After seeing children's initial response's to Un Lun Dun, did you change your writing style in any other ways when it came to writing Railsea?</strong></p> <p>I'm sure I changed my style - I mean, I think the two books have very different voices - but not in terms of thinking \"this is what readers/children/anyone wants\". I think I would be very bad at second-guessing that, and honestly it's not something I'm wildly excited about or interested in doing. I'm much more interested in writing in a voice that excites me and trying to do it in a way that I can win people over. To that extent - and I'm repeating something I've said before, for which apologies, but occasionally a line comes out of your mouth that is useful enough that you end up recycling it - I don't think my job is to try to give readers what they want; I think my job is to try to make readers want what I give. </p> <p>Of course, I may fail! </p> <p><strong>You seem to have a specific interest in the damage we are doing to the environment and how it is affecting us. (The Smog, Upsky, and the origins of the Railsea). Why is this?</strong></p> <p>Well, the interest is simply that such degradation and despoliation is enormously worrying. There is also something awesome - awful, but awesome - awe-ful - about those ruined landscapes. There is something both dreadful but also compelling about those visions. I don't think I'm alone in this - lots of cultural bits and pieces, while they're sincerely concerned about pollution, say, are also endlessly fascinated with depicting it in amazing, even beautiful ways. Culture often has it both ways like that. All of which said, I think in the context of a story, I'm happy to use these ideas for texture, to give me, and hopefully some readers something to chew on, but they aren't intended to be tracts making political arguments. That wouldn't work. The Smog in Un Lun Dun obviously has something to do, yes, with environmental issues, but within the story, above and beyond all that, it has to be an enjoyable, scary monster. </p> <p><strong>Is it the role of all science fiction writers to be prophetic like HG Wells?</strong></p> <p>I think science fiction is very bad at prediction. That doesn't mean no ideas from SF ever end up, in some complicated, half-accurate, circuitous way finding some kind of reality in the world. Obviously, sometimes that does happen. But far, far, far more of the ideas of SF never turn real, and the ones that do often do so in very misleading ways. None of this is a criticism! I know some people think it is the role of SF to be prophetic: I don't. I think the role of science fiction is not at all to prophecy. I think it is to tell interesting, vivid, strange stories that at their best are dreamlike intense versions and visions of today. </p> <p><strong>You seem to have a fascination with subverting creatures usually considered innocent and harmless into deadly beasts. Is this to try and control and manipulate your readers, taking them out of their comfort zone?</strong></p> <p>Personally, as I was so immersed in the story, it did not initially strike me as odd within the context of the story. I suppose possibly to some extent, but in an ideal world you'd hope you're pushing readers enjoyably out of comfort zones with all sorts of things, not only with the animals. But as one component of that? Certainly! It's also, as I mentioned before, an enjoyment in jokes. Nothing more sophisticated than trying to make something incredibly adorable and cute really scary and either evil or terrifying or both. And, I suppose, there's nothing to preclude vice versa. Perhaps a cuddly pet shark or something might crop up. </p> <p><strong>You also seem to have an interest in the mammoth and the gigantic. Is there a specific reason for this?</strong></p> <p>Doubtless. But I'm often the last to know the reasons behind My Things. In this case, there's something about disobedient scale which is endlessly intoxicating. Not only to me, of course - it's a common bit of brain candy. But it's one to which I am indeed thoroughly addicted. Something about making the normal strange, I think. Tentatively. </p> <p> <br><em><strong>Can we please note, just in case anyone is reading this who might want to come innocent to the books, that the following question contains mild SPOILERS! </strong></em></p> <p><strong>Both Railsea and Un Lun Dun come to satisfying conclusions (eg the happy ever after scenario). Do you plan to continue this approach in future children's books?</strong></p> <p>It would entirely depend on the book. It's certainly not something about which I have a principle in general. I do tend to feel happy and to be enjoying myself when I'm writing books with younger readers - with my younger self - in mind, so maybe that's why, but I'd like to reserve the right to write something thoroughly miserable in that vein, too. Not that I'm in a hurry to, but you never know.</p> <p><strong>Are you ever tempted to end with a cliffhanger or kill off the hero/heroine?</strong></p> <p>Cliffhangers, no. (Though some of my other books some people think end in that unresolved manner. I don't - I think they always reach a resolution, but I can accept there's a reasonable disagreement about it.) The death of a heroine or hero? Certainly, if I felt like it was appropriate for the book. Awful things have happened to some of my protagonists in some of my other books, and might do again. I am terrible at sad films, but I don't dislike sad books in the same way. </p> <p><strong>Who are Indigo and Oscar, the people you have dedicated your children's books to?</strong></p> <p>You are the first person ever to ask me that. Kudos. Indigo is my niece, my sister's daughter. Oscar is the son of a very good friend of mine. </p> <p><strong>Can you tell us what are you working on next?</strong></p> <p>Some short stories, a long novel, some non-fiction, bit of this, bit of that. I know that's really vague, and I apologise if I'm being annoying. I don't mean to be coy - I just get very superstitious about talking about work in progress. It feels like a dreadful hostage to fortune to announce it to the universe while it is still in the process of being formed. It feels like the universe will punish me - and the writing - for my presumption. So I'd rather stay a bit schtum. </p> <p><strong>Are there any plans for an Un Lun Dun film in the near future?</strong></p> <p>We have had some conversations with film-makers at various points, and some people have been excited about the idea, but nothing concrete. I would be happy if something interesting came along, and I'm very open-minded, but I think setting your hopes on film stuff is a good and efficient way to make yourself go crazy, so I attempt to opt out of such aspirations. One day, perhaps, but I wouldn't hold your breath. </p> <p><strong>Lastly I have a suggestion for you, why not write a short story about what the Olympics would be like in Un Lun Dun?</strong></p> <p>This is a startling and excellent idea. Immediately various sporting events are suggesting themselves to me. I am grateful to you for the suggestion. I do ruminate on a return to Deeba and Zanna one day, so who knows?<br> <strong>Thank you so much! </strong></p>",
  "<p>After pleading guilty to an offence under the Offences Against the Person Act in July, Sarah Catt was on Monday sentenced to eight years in prison by Mr Justice Cooke. Catt self-induced an abortion at about week 39 of her pregnancy, using drugs she bought over the internet. The remains of the foetus have not been found.</p> <p>Eight years for any offence is a hefty sentence. Eight years when the judge expressly declares he is giving a full one-third credit for early plea (so the sentence would otherwise be 12 years) makes it particularly so, even for an offence that carries a maximum of life.</p> <p>It is difficult to fully weigh up a sentence where there is little guidance \u2013 thankfully, this is a rare offence, so previous decisions are scarce. Written sentencing remarks are becoming more common, and can often be helpful in terms of illuminating the thought process and motivation of the judge when deciding punishment.</p> <p>The sentencing remarks in this case are in full <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/sarah-louise-catt-sentencing-remarks-17092012.pdf\" title=\"\">here</a>. Paragraph 15 mentions the Abortion Act. The judge says: \"There is no mitigation available by reference to the Abortion Act, whatever view one takes of its provisions which are, wrongly, liberally construed in practice so as to make abortion available essentially on demand prior to 24 weeks with the approval of registered medical practitioners.\"</p> <p>Of course, interpreting the precise meaning of a person's words is never easy. However, one reading of that passage suggests that the judge considers we as a society are wrong in giving the Abortion Act a liberal construct to allow as many women as possible abortions under its terms.</p> <p>Considering the offence he is sentencing, the remarks are cause for concern. One starts to wonder if there are motivations involved that ought have no place in the sentencing of any person.</p> <p>When one starts looking into the background of the judge, it transpires that he was appointed vice-president of the Lawyers' Christian Fellowship in 2003, and remains in post today.</p> <p>The Lawyers' Christian Fellowship (LCF) is an organisation that, alongside other activities, lobbies government on issues such as abortion and gay rights. <a href=\"http://www.powerbase.info/index.php/Andrea_Minichiello_Williams\" title=\"\">Andrea Minichiello Williams</a> is a past director of public policy of the LCF. While in post, Williams described the human fertilisation bill as the \"work of the devil\", and made no secret of the fact she believed (and presumably still does) that abortion ought to be illegal. The LCF has been involved in campaigning for changes to abortion law via the human fertilisation and embryology bill.</p> <p>On any level, the offence committed by Sarah Catt can only be described as serious. However, her history of late-stage abortion, adoption and of live births from pregnancies kept secret until as late as possible, are suggestive of someone with \u2013 an understatement, this \u2013 some issues around pregnancy. Although there was a psychiatric report which didn't disclose any psychiatric condition, the judge, according to paragraph 7 of his remarks, saw no need of a report from a psychologist. Such a report might have revealed a condition (such as post-traumatic stress, for example) outside of the remit of the psychiatric report the judge did view.</p> <p>When one reads the remarks of the judge knowing his belief system, one can only ask: did the judge view this case only on the context of the crime she actually committed, or also in the context of a crime against a god which may not be hers?</p> <p>Back in 1924, Lord Hewart, then the lord chief justice, said: \"It is not merely of some importance, but of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly be seen to be done.\" Have we seen justice done here?</p>",
  "<p>Alan Pardew has admitted that the Newcastle striker Demba Ba's \u00a37m buy-out clause will still be active in the January transfer window.</p> <p>The striker is missing from the club's Europa League squad for their meeting with Mar\u00edtimo, though Pardew has insisted that it is not linked to comments made by Ba's agent, Alex Gontran, on Tuesday which suggested his client might seek a move away if he continues to be played out wide, or left on the bench.</p> <p>Pardew said he held talks with Ba before the squad left for Portugal, and told the BBC that he wants the player to stay at the club.</p> <p>\"There is that clause in his contract and it makes us vulnerable. It's still open in the next window.</p> <p>\"I have spoken to Demba [about his agent] and told him I was disappointed with some of the comments around him. [But] sometimes it's out of his control and out of my control.</p> <p>\"We know each other well enough, and I've got no problems with him, because he is a team player who wants to do his best for the team. He has always been like that.</p> <p>\"I just think the agent stuff was people saying things they shouldn't say, really. It doesn't really affect myself and Demba, because we've got a very good relationship.\"</p>",
  "<p>If Angela Merkel wins next year's elections, she will become Germany's second-longest-serving postwar chancellor after Helmut Kohl \u2013 and be heading towards becoming Europe's longest-serving female head of government, eclipsing Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>Such a political triumph is not about to get any easier. Merkel could yet fall foul of the euroszone turmoil. And then there is also the fact that Germany's political landscape has become more fragmented than at any time since the end of the second world war.</p> <p>\"Germany is not becoming ungovernable, but it's definitely becoming harder to form governments,\" said Hans Kundnani, a Germany analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>Five to six parties have been competing for seats in the Bundestag since East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, including the Christian Democrats; their Bavarian sister party, the CSU; the pro-business FDP; the Greens; and the PDS or Party of Democratic Socialism \u2013 later to become Die Linke, (the Left). Next year, a new force will try to join the mix, an upstart party called the Pirates, which has made striking gains in four state elections so far.</p> <p>The Freie W\u00e4hler, (free voters), a campaign group of Eurosceptic, anti-bailout campaigners is also trying to establish itself and while it has yet to enjoy the sort of poll successes of the Pirates, it is being tipped as a future player on the political scene, particularly if anti-European sentiment increases.</p> <p>\"There is a very considerable potential for dissatisfaction in Germany right now,\" said Gunnar Beck, a German reader in EU law at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), University of London.</p> <p>The quiet revolution in German politics is being prepared in a small office space in Berlin's Mitte district, where the Pirates' head, Bernd Schl\u00f6mer, a criminologist by training, sits at a table surrounded by crates of Club-Mate energy drinks and shelves of computer equipment.</p> <p>\"There is a mood change taking place in Germany,\" he said. \"The other parties are suffering from the fact that they are not seen as innovative forces and we're benefiting from that.\"</p> <p>Germans, he said, want to be \"far more involved\" in the decision-making process. Though he admitted the difficulty faced by his party, whose main campaign issue is to push for more internet freedom, of \"trying to develop a political style from nothing\".</p> <p>He said it is unfair to criticise the party for its vague stance on major issues. It is developing them, he said, arguing that other more established parties are often no clearer.</p> <p>\"We have no answers to the euro crisis, but neither do the other parties.\"</p> <p>Yet just as his party is benefiting from the crisis drawing in an anti-establishment crowd, so the crisis should be seen as an opportunity.</p> <p>\"We should use the crisis to redefine Europe, to redefine Germany's political landscape. This crisis is a chance,\" he said, adding something you do not expect to hear from the mouth of a politician. \"My party's greatest ambition would be to become obsolete because everyone else copied us.\"</p> <p>The question is whether the party will be strong enough to change the system or whether, as many analysts rather suspect, it will become subsumed by it.</p> <p>\"The more the Pirates are involved in the parliamentary process, the more they'll have to play within the rules,\" said Gerd Languth, professor of political science at the University of Bonn. \"It cannot be ruled out that they'll enter the Bundestag, but there's still quite a lot of doubt.\"</p> <p>While the three-party traffic-light coalition (Greens, Liberals, SPD) is a possibility, or even a minority government, most experts predict a return to the grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats last seen in 2005. While at the outset it can seem unwieldy, general consensus seems to be that it can work more effectively in challenging times.</p> <p>While branding German voters highly traditionalist, and preferring to vote for a party rather than a personality, Languth, said that Merkel's own personality ratings had been so consistently high that \"it's hard to imagine that the Merkel factor won't play a role\" in the election outcome.</p> <p>He said there was no sign that Germany was in danger of becoming ungovernable. \"Because Germany's system is representative that means that six or more parties can still get into the Bundestag, which in theory might lead to a lack of stability, but it is also Germany's democratic advantage, above, say, Great Britain.\"</p> <p>The German system is also supported by the high degree to which Germans desire political consensus, he added. \"It's amazing how consensus-oriented the Germans are, in part due to the collective trauma of the 1920s and 30s. Add to that the fact they're also overwhelmingly pro-European and that simply increases the sense of consensus, which say, is greater than the will to topple Merkel.\"</p> <p>Many are fearful though of that consensus and its potentially stultifying consequences. The leftwing political commentator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/21/angela-merkel-hamburg-christian-democrats-germany\" title=\"\">Jakob Augstein</a> has said a Grand Coalition between the CDU and SPD would cause a \"German paralysis\".</p> <p>\"A Grand Coalition is not a symbol of our democracy but of a long and lingering illness ... It would feel like Germans had given up on their political system ... It amounts to a resignation. A silence,\" he recently commented.</p> <p>Kundnani said that what's happened in Germany is merely a reflection on what's happened elsewhere. \"Politics has become less tribal,\" he said. In other words, people are no longer voting for the same party for life and your party affiliations no longer determine the job you do.</p> <p>\"The big game-changer was the arrival of Die Linke, as a belated consequence of German unification, which led to the fragmentation of German politics and make it harder to have a two-party coalition,\" he said. \"When the Grand Coalition was formed in 2005 it was the only option left \u2013 largely because the Linke had eaten into the SPD vote so much that they could no longer head a government. Many said that there would be no more two-party coalitions, but it seems we're back to that situation.\"</p> <p>Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior transatlantic fellow with the <a href=\"http://www.gmfus.org/\" title=\"\">German Marshall Fund</a> in Berlin, said she did not believe a Grand Coalition would be damaging to Germany: \"Though we know from experience it could be boring and painful, and that boredom and pain will be more or less depending on who the challenger is.\" Despite their current poor standing in the polls, neither would she exclude, she said, the scenario of a Social Democrat chancellor in the event of an economic downturn.</p> <p>What makes Germany complicated to govern is the federal parliamentary democracy structure put in place by the allies after the second world war \u2013 consisting of the two-chamber legislature, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, plus the constitutional court that in effect polices it \u2013 which aimed to make the political landscape as inclusive as possible, said Wolfgang Nowak, director of Deutsche Bank's <a href=\"http://www.alfred-herrhausen-gesellschaft.de/en/\" title=\"\">Alfred Herrhausen Society</a> and a former adviser to the Social Democrat chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.</p> <p>\"The German system works on the basis that it's better to have the opposition in parliament than on the street,\" he said. \"Whether that makes sense or not is another question, but what we have is a very complex electoral system which tries to bind all currents into one parliament. The executive in Germany is very, very tightly controlled. Is Germany weakened by that? Yes, of course. But is Britain stronger with a two-party government?\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15737185\" title=\"\">David McAllister</a>, the CDU prime minister of Lower Saxony, said stability was a relative concept. \"If you look at other countries with a proportional representation system, the German political system has been very stable over the last 65 to 70 years. Compare it to Italy, where political parties like the Christian Democrats have completely disappeared, or you look at the Netherlands or Denmark, it's quite clear that Germany has quite a stable system. And I'm not sure we will have a six-party system in the long term \u2013 the Linke seem to have reached their peak, and the Pirates? Well, they just have to grow up and start working on their programme if they want to have a chance but in the meantime they've taught us that we've got to explain more about what we're doing at all stages of the political process.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was, Angela Merkel reflects, the most galling mistake of her childhood. Not a lie or a betrayal, some malicious gossip or a fistfight but the moment in which the young girl from East Germany crawled into the resinous hollow of a tree wearing a new tracksuit sent to her from the West.</p> <p>The anecdote speaks volumes about a dutiful, conscientious, slightly awkward woman who, though pre-eminent in Germany for seven years, is still a relative enigma to her compatriots. It was a response to an array of questions put to her by S\u00fcddeutsche magazine as part of a broader inquiry: \"Who is this person who is governing our country?\"</p> <p>The answer: a woman who regrets not being able to go shopping without being recognised; who would most like to have supper with Vicente del Bosque, the manager of the Spanish football team; who powers down through hiking, cooking or laughing and whose biggest fear is, no, not the collapse of the euro, but getting caught unprotected in a thunderstorm.</p> <p>A man who knows Merkel better than most and admits to being referred to as her \"little pet\" is David McAllister, 41, an up-and-coming member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and prime minister of Lower Saxony who has been tipped as a future chancellor (and also happens to be half Scottish). He puts her success down to her commonality. \"There's no ballyhoo with her,\" he says. \"She's very direct and down to earth. What Germans love is they see her on Friday in Brussels with Hollande, Obama, Cameron, whoever, and then they see in their newspaper the next day how directly after that she went shopping for her supper in the supermarket. The photograph of that wasn't fixed. Everyone knows that that's the way she is.\"</p> <p>He also credits her with modernising the CDU, a party whose members \u2013 typically Catholic, male, western, family-oriented \u2013 she has led as a Lutheran, eastern, childless woman. \"I think there are hundreds of thousands of people in this country who now vote for the CDU who wouldn't have done before her,\" McAllister added. He said that while well aware that Germans tend to vote for a party rather than a personality, the CDU is desperately trying to persuade people \"if you want Angela Merkel you've got to vote for the CDU,\" in recognition of how strong the Merkel factor is.</p> <p>Others are less charitable. The academic and former adviser to Helmut Kohl Gertrud H\u00f6hler, describes her as furtive, dangerous and a threat to Europe in her new book, The Godmother: How Angela Merkel Is Reshaping Germany, in which she coins the phrase \"System M\" to describe Merkel's modus operandi. \"For years, the press has concentrated on the question as to whether she governs well, or badly, or perhaps not at all,\" said H\u00f6hler. \"In reality, Merkel has developed an autocratic system,\" she said, and has \"already installed an autocratic regime\".</p> <p>She accuses Merkel of ruining the euro and undermining the political careers of many leading men in the CDU. She even mentions her in the same breath as German dictators of the last century and goes so far as to suggest her strict Lutheran pastor father's decision to bring her up in the authoritarian confines of the communist East, where Merkel moved with her family when she was just weeks old, was an extension of his deep desire to control her. But H\u00f6hler's book cuts against the grain of popular opinion, which still strongly favours Merkel. According to the latest poll her popularity rating is 61%, making her Germany's most popular politician.</p> <p>Wolfgang Nowak, director of Deutsche Bank's Alfred Herrhausen Society and a former adviser to the SPD chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said the reason many people, including H\u00f6hler, were suspicious of Merkel was precisely because she kept so much to herself. \"The reason there's a System M is because it's the first time in German politics that a chancellor's office sticks so tightly together so that nothing is leaked. Merkel talks to just a very small, tight, trusted circle and those who are not in that circle are often envious or offended,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There's also the theory,\" said Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller of the German Marshall Fund \"that Merkel is the kind of person that decides the more you say and the more you write, the more these things can be held against you and the less said the better, the more done the better. I'd guess her motto was: 'Let's get more done' and that strikes me as entirely sensible. Particularly in a media age, that's a sign of strength.\"</p> <p>Nowak added it is indeed true, as Hohler writes, that many men who once held big positions in the party are now gone, \"but not because Merkel killed them off, rather, they were simply unmasked for what they were \u2013 CDU career politicians, puppets or fraudsters\".</p> <p>Gunnar Beck, a reader in law from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, is rather more sceptical, saying that Merkel is only held in such high regard because those around her don't make the grade. He is critical of her diplomatic skills, as well as her judgment of character. \"By comparison to a rather unfortunate line of politicians who have been exposed for irregularities of various kinds, (including the former president and former defence minister) she appears to be the paragon of virtue and that's noticed by the electorate, albeit in the context of a low general standard. She's entirely above criticism in her personal life and work ethic, but you've got to put it into perspective. While she's a very good domestic political operator she is helpless abroad and she's also a spectacularly bad judge of character,\" he says, citing her promotion of many who have since fallen (including the president, defence minister and Nicolas Sarkozy) and others who have not, including the European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, and Jorg Asmussen, an executive board member of the ECB. Beck is also wary of the idea that Merkel has a sophisticated plan. \"She is a superbly shrewd party and domestic politician but has been repeatedly outmanoeuvred by Draghi, Monti, Hollande and others. There is no sign that she has a masterplan regarding the euro.\"</p> <p>Among those critical of Merkel's lack of vision is Hans Kundnani, a Germany analyst and editorial director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"What's needed now is someone who can talk up the benefits of the single currency, of Germany's role in the euro narrative, including the fact that it bears responsibility for this flawed currency, rather than saying: 'we're the victims of it,'\" he said. \"She's not particularly visionary or bold.\"</p> <p>Gerd Languth, a political analyst and Merkel biographer, said this was precisely what Germans liked about her. \"She is extremely pragmatic, and non-ideological, like most Germans are.\" She had, he said, been strengthened by the knowledge that despite criticism from outside Germany over her euro policies, the support for her within was stronger than ever. \"She notices that the more she's attacked from outside, the more the solidarity towards her within Germany grows,\" he said. \"Germans don't know what she wants, but the trust in her is unshakeable, and if the ship cants, she's the one they want to be at the helm.\"</p> <p>While there is at this stage, a year before a general election, quite a degree of expectation that Merkel will be re-elected, much is still at stake, not least, if the German economy takes a dive or the euro plunges into more misery, which could see the tide of popular opinion turning against her. Despite the growing disgruntlement towards her among Christian Democrats, Languth said he found it hard \"to imagine a CDU governing without Merkel if they're standing high in the polls\".</p> <p>What he is sure about though is that if Merkel were not re-elected \"she'd disappear from politics altogether\". Asked what he thought she would do, he said that unlike her predecessor and close friend of Putin, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, \"she would not go to work for Gazprom\".</p> <p><em>The final paragraph of this article was changed on Thursday, September 20 to read \"close friend\" of Putin rather than \"close fiend\". The error was introduced during the editing process</em></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/sky-fit-and-proper-rules-ofcom\" title=\"\">Harsh words for James Murdoch from Ofcom</a>, as the regulator concluded that BSkyB was a \"fit and proper\" holder of a broadcasting licence on Thursday morning. But Ofcom does not unambiguously state that the former News International and BSkyB chairman is himself \"fit and proper\" \u2013 the kind of verdict that will be repeatedly thrown back at him as he tries to rehabilitate his career at News Corporation in the US.</p> <p>Look at what Ofcom says about Murdoch, who remains News Corp deputy chief operating officer but has relinquished his responsibilities for the company's UK businesses, about his time when he ran News International. It considers that: \"James Murdoch's conduct in various instances fell short of the standard to be expected of the chief executive officer and chairman,\" and is only prepared to add: \"We do not find that James Murdoch's retention as a non-executive director of Sky means that Sky is not fit and proper to hold broadcast licences.\" After all, Ofcom notes, Murdoch is just one of 13 directors of Sky with only limited influence as a result.</p> <p>The issue is how Murdoch handled allegations made in civil law suits from Gordon Taylor and others about News of the World phone hacking \u2013 and a July 2009 report in the Guardian which indicated that the practice was widespread at the News of the World. Ofcom does say there is no evidence that \"James Murdoch knew of widespread wrongdoing or criminality\" at the tabloid or elsewhere or that \"he was complicit in a cover-up\". But, the regulator goes on to note a company director \"is required to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence\" and it is clear the body believes he didn't meet the mark.</p> <p>Ofcom pursues the point relentlessly: \"We consider James Murdoch's conduct, including his failure to initiate action on his own account on a number of occasions, to be both difficult to comprehend and ill-judged.\" The regulator continues by saying that he \"repeatedly fell short of the exercise of responsibility to be expected of him as CEO and chairman\" of News International. And finally \u2013 for extra measure \u2013 Ofcom says there are \"questions regarding James Murdoch's competence in the handling of these matters, and his attitude towards the possibility of wrongdoing in the companies for which he was responsible\".</p> <p>There is little by way of personal mitigation, although almost grudgingly Ofcom does note that when Murdoch was chief executive of Sky it was a \"very successful company\" \u2013 and the reason why the verdict did not go against the satellite broadcaster is almost certainly the more obvious point: there is no evidence that Sky executives were directly involved or indirectly involved in alleged or admitted wrongdoing at News International. But it seems absolutely clear that Murdoch could not have remained as chairman of Sky for five minutes had he still be in that job after this report was published. Most likely, he cannot regain that role either.</p> <p>James Murdoch's role is now a matter for News Corp and its shareholders. A large part of the voting stock \u2013 nearly 40% \u2014 is controlled by his father Rupert, but even other family members (in particular his sister Liz) no longer support him. That said, News Corp saw fit to pay James Murdoch $16.8m (\u00a310.4m) last year, including a $5m bonus. The question is whether James, his father, the company and its stockholders believe that is fair enough in the light of Ofcom's conclusions.</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, believes that intelligence agents loyal to president Robert Mugabe's Zanu PF party orchestrated a plot to humiliate and embarrass him ahead of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/16/morgan-tsvangirai-marriage_n_1888070.html\" title=\"\">his wedding</a>, which was to have taken place last Saturday. What Tsvangirai does not say is that his messy love life and poor judgment have made it all too easy for such plots to succeed.</p> <p>Before the wedding, Zimbabwe was gripped by headline after headline featuring all the prime minister's women. There is his fiance, Elizabeth Macheka. There is a South African woman who claimed he proposed to her, and gave a <a href=\"http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-9040-Legend%20of%20the%20Seas%20Drama%20at%20Rotten%20Row/news.aspx\" title=\"\">graphically detailed account of their love life</a>, complete with pictures of Tsvangirai smiling on a luxury cruise ship and on a beach in the Seychelles. And there is his jilted lover, Locardia Karimatsenga, whose legal action to have the wedding stopped precipitated this damaging crisis.</p> <p>Karimatsenga approached a magistrate to have Tsvangirai's marriage licence annulled and the wedding interdicted. She argued that he could not marry another woman in a monogamous process as that would amount to bigamy. The journalists who have filed on this story did not consult legal experts, and have, subsequently failed to understand the importance of customary law in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Zimbabwe's legal system <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/16/morgan-tsvangirai-face-bigamy-charge\" title=\"\">recognises customary law</a> and not \"tribal law\", as it is patronisingly called in many international reports. Customary law is the complex system of law that governed indigenous societies in Zimbabwe prior to colonial conquest in 1890. And, like every republic, Zimbabwe also has a legal system derived from its constitution, legislation, common law and legal precedent. Zimbabwean law thus has multiple sources. Customary law on the family has detailed rules about how marriages are established and dissolved. At the same time, general law also applies to marriages, guardianship of children and inheritance. The challenge for the system has been to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the rights that derive from tradition and, on the other, progressive norms such as equality for women and protecting the rights of girls.</p> <p>The system has not always succeeded, and has led to seemingly contradictory outcomes: Zimbabwean law recognises polygamy but criminalises bigamy. A man may have any number of wives as long as he stays within the customary law framework. If he chooses to marry in a polygamous marriage, he cannot subsequently marry another woman in a monogamous marriage, as that marriage would mean the automatic divorce of the polygamous wife. To get around the bigamy laws, he would first have to divorce his customary law wife or wives before he commits to a form of marriage that allows him to marry only one wife.</p> <p>This was the argument that Karimatsenga made in her attempt to stop Tsvangirai's wedding. The <a href=\"http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/news/zimbabwe/60834/full-text-magistrates-judgement-on.html?utm_source=thezim&amp;utm_medium=homepage&amp;utm_campaign=listarticle&amp;utm_content=headinglink\" title=\"\">magistrate agreed with her</a>. He ruled that Tsvangirai had indeed married her, but he had failed to go through the formal steps under customary law that would have dissolved the marriage. The magistrate ruled further he could not issue the couple a marriage licence for a monogamous wedding until Tsvangirai had gone through the customary rites of divorce in their proper form. If Tsvangirai nonetheless went ahead and married, he would be arrested for bigamy.</p> <p>The international press has reported that he married \"in defiance\" of the court order. He actually respected it. The couple were careful not to \"marry\", and instead celebrated their already existing customary law union and affirmed their commitment to each other..</p> <p>But how much does all this matter? For the most part, Zimbabweans don't particularly care about the private lives of politicians. <a href=\"http://nehandaradio.com/2012/09/11/the-love-scandals-that-rocked-zanu-pf-part-2/\" title=\"\">President Mugabe and his wife Grace</a> began their relationship with an affair when both were married to other partners. Cabinet minsters routinely jump in and out of multiple beds, and Zimbabwe gives a collective shrug.</p> <p>This debacle matters for different reasons. It raises, once again, questions about the prime minister's judgment and fitness for office. Even his allies are lining up to speak out. The Independent, a leading business weekly, <a href=\"http://www.theindependent.co.zw/2012/09/14/tsvangirai-sex-scandals-risky/\" title=\"\">asked the question: is he fit to govern</a>, while veteran journalist Geoff Nyarota <a href=\"http://www.thestandard.co.zw/2012/09/10/hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-woman-scorned/\" title=\"\">encouraged Tsvangirai to have regard for the dignity of his office</a>. Certainly, his multiple, and, apparently, simultaneous, sexual relationships with partners who appear to have been subject to no vetting not only demonstrates his extremely poor judgment, they also raise security concerns. He has made it woefully easy for his enemies to portray him as a sex-crazed maniac: the acerbic Jonathan Moyo famously wrote that Tsvangirai approaches every issue with a shut mind and every woman with an open zip.</p> <p>Tsvangirai's poor judgment is particularly puzzling given that he has been the subject of intelligence plots before: <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3744004.stm\" title=\"\">he barely escaped from an orchestrated treason trial</a>. The invisible hand of the intelligence agency is, indeed, all over this debacle. The events had a smooth efficiency that suggests careful planning. It cannot be said often enough that any plot against him only worked because Tsvangirai has made himself vulnerable to such plots.</p> <p>Will this hurt him? There is the very real possibility that Tsvangirai will not only survive this, but may even gain a sympathy bump in his popularity. The intelligence agents who orchestrated this debacle overreached themselves. Tsvangirai has certainly been exposed as a self-indulgent and careless man. But his enemies have demonstrated a single-minded ruthlessness that shows why Zimbabwe desperately needs a new constitution and a change of government. The apparent use of state resources and machinery to humiliate the president's main rival demonstrates clearly why Zanu PF can no longer be an option for Zimbabwe.</p> <p>This is Zimbabwe's tragedy: the mantle of leadership has rested too long on the shoulders of the man who currently leads Zimbabwe, and it will sit uneasily on the man who wants to unseat him. But voters are likely to conclude that Tsvangirai is the lesser of two evils. Flawed as he is, he may just make it.</p>",
  "<p>Look at the strange result of the publication of those intimate photos of a British prince and his wife - an Irish politician calls for a privacy law and French police raid a magazine, effectively closing its offices.</p> <p>Am I alone in noting the oddity, even irony, of such disproportionate actions given that Ireland and France are republics dancing attendance upon Britain's monarchy?</p> <p>The knee-jerk call by Ireland's justice minister, Alan Shatter, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/17/irish-justice-minister-privacy-media\">to revisit privacy legislation,</a> followed the Irish Daily Star's decision to reproduce the pages of Closer magazine containing the intimate pictures of William and Kate.</p> <p>It was a bizarre reaction, ignoring the fact that Ireland's system of press self-regulation has been regarded - not least in Britain - as a successful model. It is thought to be working so well that advice from its press ombudsman, John Horgan, was sought by the Leveson inquiry.</p> <p>Shatter's call is almost certainly going to fail. But I was amazed that he should feel so passionately about the intrusion into the private life of British royals.</p> <p>My hunch, based on spending several months a year in Ireland over the past 23 years, is that a fair proportion of the Irish people adore the inhabitants of Buckingham Palace.</p> <p>Then again, a good many would not be happy to create legislation based on the travails of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. </p> <p>Then there is France, where<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/19/kate-topless-photos-swedish-magazine\"> police raided the Paris offices of Closer magazine yesterday</a> in their hunt to discover the identity of the photographer who snapped the pictures.</p> <p>So, in a republic proudly proclaiming the republican slogan of libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9 and fraternit\u00e9, its police - following up on a what is known as a \"judicial request\" - acted on behalf of the British throne. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2205467/French-magazine-raided-hunt-Kate-paparazzi-countries-say-theyll-print-pictures.html\">the royalist Daily Mail noted in its story on the affair,</a> in an interview with a French lawyer, the raid appears to have been authorised specifically because of the royal family's involvement.</p> <p>It quotes Christophe Bigot, a barrister who specialises in media law, who questioned the legality of the Paris raid because journalistic sources, which includes photographers, are strictly protected by French law.</p> <p>Bigot said: \"A law of January 2, 2010, protects the confidentiality of sources, as do numerous decisions of the European court of human rights. In the case of William and Kate, I do not see how a prosecutor could justify a search of Closer.\"</p> <p>It shows, once again, that Britain's monarchy exercises almost mystical powers. It remains, even in republics, an institution of fascination, sometimes bordering on adulation. </p> <p>Why should that be? For republicans like me, it is galling. We can never seem to overcome its symbolic significance, which imbues its family with a glamour, a magic even, that stubbornly maintains its popularity at both home and abroad.</p>",
  "<p>The media regulator Ofcom has found that BSkyB remains a \"fit and proper\" owner of a broadcast licence despite the phone-hacking affair that embroiled its parent company and during which, it said, James Murdoch's conduct repeatedly fell short of the standard to be expected.</p> <p>The review, carried out in the wake of the scandal and News International's closure of the News of the World, was aimed at establishing whether the satellite television group \u2013 whose largest shareholder is News Corporation \u2013 remained eligible to broadcast in the UK.</p> <p>If it had decided that either Murdoch \u2013 the younger son of Rupert Murdoch who stood down as chairman of News International in March and as chairman of BSkyB in April, but remains on the board as a non-executive director \u2013 or the company itself were not fit and proper owners, the regulator could have revoked BSkyB's licence.</p> <p>But despite finding fault with James Murdoch's response to the phone-hacking allegations, Ofcom concluded BSkyB could keep its licence.</p> <p>The ruling found: \"There is no evidence that Sky was directly or indirectly involved in any of the wrongdoing either admitted or alleged to have taken place at [NoW] or the Sun.</p> <p>\"In the circumstances, and notwithstanding our views in relation to James Murdoch's conduct, we do not consider, having taken into account all the relevant factors, that on the evidence available to date Sky is no longer fit and proper to hold broadcast licences.</p> <p>\"Whilst we consider that James Murdoch's conduct in various instances fell short of the standard to be expected of the chief executive officer and chairman, we do not find that James Murdoch's retention as a non-executive director of Sky means that Sky is not fit and proper to hold broadcast licences.</p> <p>\"We recognise that whether it is appropriate for James Murdoch to be a director in light of the events is a matter for the board and shareholders of Sky.\"</p> <p>Sky welcomed the long-awaited ruling, as its share price rose slightly in early trading on Thursday, up 5p \u2013 nearly 1% \u2013 to 733p at 9am.</p> <p>\"Ofcom is right to conclude that Sky is a fit and proper broadcaster.

  "<p>Data is everywhere: from governments publishing billions of bytes of the stuff, to visual artists creating new concepts of the world through to companies building businesses on the back of it. </p> <p>And everyone wants to be a data journalist too - the barriers for entry have never been lower as free tools change the rules on who can analyse, visualise and present data. Truly, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/may/24/data-journalism-punk\">anyone can do it</a>.</p> <p>At the same time, journalism has undergone a transformation; it's not that long ago that the only way to get a story published by a major news organisation involved years of training and interning and generally slaving away until you get noticed and published. Now, the power has shifted and the days when journalists could shut themselves away from the world in order to hand out gems of beautiful writing have well and truly vanished. </p> <p>These are the days of open journalism, reporters who can use the power of the web can produce stronger, better stories. Open journalism involves the person reading and commenting on the story as much as the original reporter, and with the power to shape and influence the news they see in front of them. </p> <p>But how does that connect to data journalism? These are two segments of the same pie chart - and for data journalism to develop beyond just being the latest fad, it has to engage and involve the people reading the news as well as creating it. </p> <p>Data journalism is not (just) about being clever and showing the world how clever you are. It has to be about more than that.</p> <p>It's important because data journalism has its roots in publicly available data. As soon as <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/\">data.gov</a> launched in 2009 it didn't matter how good or bad it was - the principle had been set: all government data must be public, and available in a form you can use. Since then, the world has been deluged in open data, with cities, states and regions around the globe publishing everything from detailed crime statistics to the locations of public toilets.</p> <p>But having an open data portal doesn't automatically make you a haven of freedom - even <a href=\"http://www.data.gov.bh/wps/portal/data/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hfR08jT0sTI0t_UwsnA0_XMF8jL4sQQwtTE_1wkA6zeAsDE0dDT3cDdwt_HzMDz1B3T_eQUC9DA39TiLwBDuBooO_nkZ-bqh-cWKRfkJ2d5uioqAgAxFw7sA!!/dl3/d3/L0lHSkovd0RNQU5rQUVnQSEhL1lCZncvZW4!/\">Bahrain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.saudi.gov.sa/wps/portal/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3iTMGenYE8TIwODUEsLA89QU69g11A_YwMTQ_3g1Dz9gmxHRQCO1nwy\">Saudi Arabia</a> now have open data portals. As this <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2012/09/open_data_movement_how_to_keep_information_from_being_politicized_.html\">prescient article by David Eaves in Slate points out</a>. He says</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For many of us who have campaigned for the right to access and reuse government information, it would be easy to pause and relish the sweet victory. We have the ammunition, so now, believe the most techno-utopian advocates, open data will fundamentally change politics\u2014depoliticizing debates and eliminating irresponsible positions. But that would be a mistake.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is where data journalists come in - by exposing and interrogating the data, we can test how accurate it is, mash it up with other datasets to produce results that tell you something new about the news. </p> <p>Because, traditionally journalists have treated data with a kind of breathless trust which they would never accord a human source. Numbers are trusted, because investigating them is too scary. Former BBC reporter Michael Blastland, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7605118.stm\">examined the norovirus - or winter vomiting bug - outbreak of 2008</a>, showing exactly how easy it is to get the numbers wrong. The story was that three million people had gone down the previous year with the disease.</p> <p>He looked at the confidence intervals - the guide to how reliable these numbers were - and realised that the number could just as easily be 280,000. Or even 34 million. The truth of the story was, nobody knew, but the story had been written up anyway.</p> <p>There are historic examples of great journalists adopting data too, of course; <a href=\"http://pmeyer.web.unc.edu/\">Philip Meyer</a>, the US journalist behind the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/09/riot-theory-relative-detroit-england\">Detroit project</a> which inspired our Reading the Riots project - a reporter who used data to create classic new forms of journalism.</p> <p>But this is not a niche form of reporting anymore.</p> <p>The people that seem to care about the numbers are out there in the world: our readers. Arguably most of the million or so people who read the Datablog each month are predominantly general-interest readers; not developers, designers or even other journalists. They want the numbers because they want to trust the report, to test its veracity and sometimes to see what else they can find in the data. </p> <p>Because everyone is an expert in something, that engagement can mean fascinating results - including us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/apr/13/mapping-colours-open-journalism-storify\">improving our map colours on the blog with the help of our readers</a>.</p> <p>However, plenty of data is still closed, and we in the media are part of this process. Often it's more likely that the data will be alluded to in a story or interactive and you will be kept away from it.</p> <p>It's as if to say: \"look - we made this fantastic interactive guide, you couldn't possibly have anything to offer. So long, and thanks for looking!\"</p> <p>The raw data of key national and international events is often witheld - in favour of snazzy presentations of the information without allowing you access to the data behind it to download for yourself. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jun/21/open-data-election-hack-vote\">Immediate and detailed election data is one example</a>, supplied by paid-for feed and certainly not available for immediate download. Or there's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/london-2012-olympics-open-data\">live Olympic results - you might be able to see an athlete winning a gold before your eyes, but is that raw data available for you to visualise and experiment with?</a> </p> <p>News organisations may be campaigners for open information but by withholding that data, become complicit in a system which essentially keeps data private until it's no longer commercially valuable. It's all very well calling for governments to throw open the doors of their data vaults, but if you are not willing to be open too, what is that worth?</p> <p>Open data assumes the readers are an integral part of the story - open data journalism does the same. By publishing the data in an accessible form, making it available to whoever wants it, suddenly our journalism is stronger and better. So, this is our ten point guide to how it can work:</p> <h2>1. Expose the data behind the story</h2> <p>The best journalism reveals something new about the world - and feels timely and of the moment. Data journalism works when it forces itself into the agenda and makes the news. Timely means people will care about it enough to try and become part of the story.</p> <h2>2. Provide the key data people need</h2> <p>It's a mess out there. As a reader, how can you find the key dataset you need at that moment, data that's not too old or too unreliable. That's where data journalism's role in curating the key numbers can come in. The skills of research are a key part of being a reporter and the editorial role of selecting the key data mean you can help readers find what they're really looking for. Journalists can be the bridge between the providers of data and the consumers - and interpret that data to bring it alive but also to test and check it.</p> <h2>3. Make it personal</h2> <p>All data is personal at some level - and the best interactive and visualisations allow users to see how the numbers reflect their lives where they live. As more and more granular data is released about tiny geographies, by making it personal, we can bring it to life.</p> <h2>4. Anyone can do it</h2> <p>They really can - often it's the skills of knowing that something is a story or not that becomes most important. There are <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9215504/22_free_tools_for_data_visualization_and_analysis\">enough free tools out there</a> to ensure that visualising and analysing the data is simple and easy.</p> <h2>5. Make our data open</h2> <p>What is open data? It is data published in a machine-readable format that anyone can use. That excludes PDFs which are - as <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/stephen-messer\">Stephen Messer</a> says - where data goes to die. By making our data open we mean producing it in a form people can use, whether it's CSV, excel or even <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/RDF/\">RDF</a>.</p> <h2>6. \"Do what you do best, and link to the rest\"</h2> <p><a href=\"http://buzzmachine.com/\">Jeff Jarvis</a> said that and the principle is simple: there's bound to be someone out there doing something amazing - why not be open enough to embrace that?</p> <h2>7. Free data - now</h2> <p>It's not enough to just aggregate data anymore - what about the raw, real-time live data behind everything from public transport to election results.</p> <h2>8. We're not the experts</h2> <p>We can't be experts in every aspect of life - why not try and engage those who are make them part of our process?</p> <h2>9. Make big data accessible</h2> <p>As the datasets that we can explore get bigger, it's our job to make them smaller and simpler to understand.</p> <h2>10. Engage</h2> <p>At the end of the day, it's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jul/28/data-journalism\">all about the stories</a>.</p> <p><em>This is an edited version of a talk given today at <a href=\"http://www.scoopcamp.de/\">Scoopcamp, Hamburg</a></em></p> <h2>More data</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p> <h2>World government data</h2> <p></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Development and aid data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br>\u2022&#xa0;Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>Most of us have picked up a feather on a walk, taken it home, and marvelled at the sculpted brilliance of its structure \u2013 and then thought no more about it. But as Thor Hanson's book shows, bird feathers are so intricately constructed that modern technologists are now seriously trying to emulate their nanostructural perfection.</p> <p>Hanson's study is a stroll through the many ramifications of feathers \u2013 their genesis, evolution, use in our duvets, use in mating displays, use as human adornment \u2013 but so amiably paced that no topic outstays its welcome. Indeed, at one point, fearing he might be in danger of becoming too technical, Hanson backs out charmingly: \"I shut down the computer and turned my attention to something more familiar \u2026\"</p> <p>Hanson is a young, independent conservation biologist, operating from an island northwest of Seattle. He is an engaging nature nut, the kind of guy who keeps dead roadkill in his freezer and is never happier than when yomping through the wild, interrogating all he sees. His enthusiasm is infectious and his subject so alluring that many science writers will be wondering: \"Why didn't I think of that?\"</p> <p>Feathers are the most complicated artefact fashioned by nature from a single substance: the protein keratin. That's the stuff that nails, hair and horse's hooves are made from. But a hair is simply a string of dead protein fibres squeezed from the follicle, like glue from a nozzle. Bird feather keratin is similarly extruded from a follicle, but it is structured so that the barbs radiating from the central quill are held together by tiny Velcro-like fasteners. All this has to be cast in a single process. The principal gene involved in this magic turns out to be the same one that tells your eyes how far apart to be, and how to grow a thumb on one side and a little finger on the other: nature's master sculptor, whimsically named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/oct/26/sonic-hedgehog-gene\" title=\"\">Sonic Hedgehog</a> after the video game.</p> <p>Feathers are at the heart of two of evolution's greatest mysteries: first, how could such an intricate structure have evolved and for what original purpose? And second, how did flight evolve? They are not the same question: bats fly, but they have no feathers. <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/02/feathers/zimmer-text\" title=\"\">Great battles have been fought over these issues</a> and Hanson recounts some of them, but in the last decade a series of fossil finds in China has helped clear up many of the mysteries. <em>Feathers</em> presents an easy way in to the standard model of bird and feather evolution.</p> <p>Unlike human-engineered constructions, most things in nature have more than one function, and the mystery of how a complex organ can have evolved so perfectly fitted to its purpose is usually that it originally evolved for something else altogether and was later co-opted to a new function. Feathers have a suite of properties to make engineers drool: lightness, thermal insulation, strength and flexibility, water-repellency and advanced structuring giving rise to iridescence. The enormous whirlpool-patterned tail feathers of the male peacock have clearly evolved to their present form through sexual selection by peahens. But what was the function of feathers before they could develop such secondary characteristics? That's where the quarrels start.</p> <p>The greatest glory of feathers lies in the dazzling iridescence they impart to many birds, most notably hummingbirds and birds of paradise. Darwin devoted four chapters to bird feathers in his investigation of sexual selection, <em>The Descent of Man</em>. Many male animals display to attract a mate. In feathers, birds have the best means available, and the mating displays of birds of paradise provided some of the most astonishing and memorable footage of all David Attenborough's programmes. What's good enough for birds is also good enough for humans, and feathers have been used in human status displays ever since the first iridescent feather was plucked from a bird. In&#xa0;the 19th century the demand for bird plumage for women's hats threatened the extinction of many species and led to the modern bird conservation movement.</p> <p>In one chapter, Hanson goes to Las Vegas to check out the showgirls. One act features gorgeously top-heavy arrays of plumage mounted on top-heavy dancers, and Hanson uses this human adornment to make an important biological point. The costumes are as extravagant as is physically possible: \"Not enough swish, and no one looks at you. Too much swish and your costume falls off,\" as one showgirl explains. Exactly the same problem is faced by the peacock, whose tail, if any larger, would be completely unsupportable.</p> <p>Less sexy is the feather-down industry, but Hanson dives in here with equal enthusiasm, visiting Pacific Coast Feathers, in his home territory of Seattle. The supply of down for duvets and pillows depends on the duck and goose consumption patterns of East Asian peoples: the feathers are a by-product. Down still beats synthetics because technologists have as yet found no way&#xa0;of mimicking the intricate branching of feathers in their synthetic polymer media.</p> <p>We go into the countryside, we read books like this, and we watch Attenborough for what the poet Louis MacNeice summed up as \"the pleasure of dappled things, the beauty of adaptation to purpose, the glory of extravagance, classic elegance or romantic nonsense and grotesquerie\". But there's more. As Hanson writes, birds and feathers are \"at the heart of one of the hottest trends in the physical sciences\": biomimetics.</p> <p>The aviation industry, after a century of scorning anything to do with natural, flapping flight, is now very interested in the more subtle control a bird's conformable wing exerts compared to the clunky flaps of an airliner. Those upturned wingtips you see on many planes now are a crude but effective way of mimicking the way a falcon's wingtip feathers fan out to control the airflow more efficiently.</p> <p>Next time you pick up a flight feather, look along its section: it will have a perfect aerofoil shape with the quill, the rachis, asymmetrically displaced to the front. This is exactly the section of an aeroplane wing. Each flight feather is a miniature wing, as perfect as any wind-tunnel-tested, computer-analysed, humanly-engineered structure.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Forbes's <em>The Gecko's Foot: How Scientists are Taking a Leaf from Nature's Book</em> is published by HarperPerennial.</p>",
