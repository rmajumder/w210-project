  "<p>It is hard to believe that Sir David Attenborough has ever mistreated a single animal in his life. This is a man for whom the natural world is sacred, after all. Yet midway through our interview, organised to promote his new television series <em>Attenborough: 60 Years in the Wild</em>, a crestfallen look crosses the great naturalist's features when I ask if he has any regrets about his career.</p> <p>\"Jumping on animals. I regret that,\" he states. I blink in disbelief. It is as if Judi Dench had admitted to glue-sniffing. Attenborough explains. \"Fifty years ago, I used to go along, chase a giant anteater and pull it by the tail so we could film it. I am sorry about that sort of thing. But those were different days.\"</p> <p>Then there was the time he and his crew were stuck in Borneo and strapped for something to film. \"I found a little crocodile and we did a cod sequence with it. We filmed it close up so that it looked like a really big crocodile. I then took off my shirt and jumped on it. Everyone thought I had a fight with a full-sized crocodile. 'God you were brave,' they told me. I wish I hadn't done that.\"</p> <p>And as for eating turtle eggs, he pulls a face. \"They were horrible, salty. I wished I hadn't done that either.\"</p> <p>As crimes against nature, these are minor transactions, it must be admitted. Yet they are informative \u2013 for it is easy to forget how attitudes to wildlife have changed since Attenborough began his career in 1952 on programmes such as <em>The</em> <em>Pattern of Animals</em> and, later, <em>Zoo Quest</em>. Wild creatures were still viewed from a Victorian perspective in those days. They were there to be tracked, captured, tied up and brought back to Britain to be goggled at. Attenborough was no different from other naturalists at the time, he admits.</p> <p><em>Zoo Quest</em> was certainly made in that mould, he believes. For the nine years it aired, Attenborough would travel with staff from London Zoo to a tropical country to capture an animal for the zoo's collection, a practice that was considered to be perfectly acceptable at the time. Attenborough's first assignment was to track down a white-necked Picathartes in Sierra Leone on the grounds that no other zoo in Europe had one or even knew what it looked like. \"I thought: 'Oooh, a bird that no one has ever even seen. I must become the first European to get one.' It was very childish really.\"</p> <p>Today Attenborough, like the rest of us, has a far more respectful attitude to animals, as the new series makes clear. Indeed, if <em>Attenborough: 60 Years in the Wild</em> has a theme it is that of transition. How attitudes to the natural world have changed and how knowledge of living things has been transformed by modern science. Not to mention the leap that has taken place in the film technology bringing the wonders of the world into our front rooms, from clockwork, wind-up cameras to stop-frame photography and thermal imaging.</p> <p>An example of these technological changes is provided in the living room of Attenborough's own elegant west London home. It is dominated, not by images of wildlife or native art, as you might expect, but by a giant 50in 3D television. Now Attenborough is certainly no geek \u2013 he can't drive and has trouble answering his mobile phone, he says \u2013 but he has pioneered a recent series of 3D programmes for Sky. He is clearly in thrall to the technology and keen to demonstrate its wonders.</p> <p>Attenborough bustles round the set, pulling out discs from a Blu-ray player, and flicking through scenes. The tasks involve a great deal of kneeling and bending over, which Attenborough accomplishes with no hint of stiffness or back pain that would leave many younger men groaning. Dressed in an open-neck light-blue shirt, chino slacks and loafers \u2013 an Attenborough uniform to judge from other interviews \u2013 he could easily pass for a man 20 years younger and is clearly determined to keep up with the latest developments in his profession.</p> <p>\"I began my career in broadcasting on the old 405 line, black-and-white TV that was broadcast from Crystal Palace,\" he adds. \"I wasn't going to say no to doing a programme in 3D that would be displayed on huge colour screens when I was offered the chance.</p> <p>\"On the other hand, as a medium, 3D TV is certainly not perfect. You are limited to what you photograph. You cannot use long focal lenses because of problems with background. And the cameras require two or three men to carry them. But oh, when you see time-lapse photography of plants flowering in 3D, the results are absolutely mesmeric.\"</p> <p>However, the real change in our perspective of the natural world is not due to improvements in TV technology but has been achieved through scientific revolutions, particularly in the fields of biology and geology. These have been the real game changers, Attenborough believes. \"We forget what we have learned in the last 60 years. At university I once asked one of my lecturers why he was not talking to us about continental drift and I was told, sneeringly, that if I could I prove there was a force that could move continents, then he might think about it. The idea was moonshine, I was informed.\"</p> <p>Yet we now know that continental drift explains a vast amount about the variation in the planet's plants and animals \u2013 for example the presence of similar families of earthworms in central Africa and in central South America \u2013 continents which were once attached to each other. Continental drift featured strongly in <em>Life on Earth</em>, Attenborough's first great series on the natural world, in 1979. What his old lecturer made of the programme is not recorded.</p> <p>Since then a host of great scientific visionaries have been interviewed by Attenborough, with Konrad Lorenz providing an unforgettable early start. Lorenz won a Nobel prize for physiology for his work on animal behaviour and had an astonishing affinity with many species, in particular greylag geese. Would he like to appear on TV and demonstrate that empathy on the air, Attenborough asked.</p> <p>Lorenz agreed and was filmed clutching a goose provided by London Zoo. \"Komm, komm, mein Liebchen,\" he murmured to the unhappy animal which, as Attenborough relates, eventually squirted a&#xa0;jet of green dung straight at the great scientist, covering his trousers. Lorenz released the goose, wiped his clothes with his handkerchief before absent-mindedly blowing his nose with it. He completed his interview, on camera, with a green smear down his face.</p> <p>Other stars to receive homage in <em>60 Years in the Wild </em>include Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey for their ape-observation work, Francis Crick and Jim Watson for their discovery of the structure of DNA, and Richard Dawkins for his ideas about the selfish gene. \"These people have completely transformed our understanding of the animal world. We see the world very differently today thanks to them.\"</p> <p>Finding ways to film these scientific visions has taken Attenborough to every conceivable place on the planet. He donned a diving suit for underwater sequences filmed for <em>The Trials of Life</em> in 1990; has been lifted to the top of rainforests by cranes; spat at by cobras; flattened by a belligerent Scottish capercaillie; and, of course, been groomed by gorillas in that glorious sequence in <em>Life on Earth</em>.</p> <p>So which spot on the planet would he recommend to give people a chance to enjoy living creatures at their best? The Gal\u00e1pagos with their iguanas? The Amazon rainforest? His answer comes as a surprise. \"People say you cannot beat the rainforest. But that is simply not true. You go there and the first thing you think is: where the hell are the birds? Where are the animals? They are hiding in the trees, of course. No, if you want beauty and wildlife, you want a coral reef. Put on a mask and stick your head under the water. The sight is mind-blowing.</p> <p>\"And that, actually, is still a mystery: why are coral reefs so beautiful and colourful? It is not immediately obvious, though the wildlife is wonderful: shell-less molluscs, crustaceans and shoals of fish that do not give a damn whether you are there or not. Your first trip to a coral reef will be one of the most transforming moments of your life.\"</p> <p>There is, of course, a downside. Coral reefs are now being destroyed at a staggering rate. Some estimates suggest around 600 square miles are lost every year, a rate double that of rainforest destruction. Reefs are dying because ocean waters are being acidified as carbon dioxide levels rise in the atmosphere as a result of human industrial activity. At the same time, rainforests are being ploughed up for farmland.</p> <p>And this takes us to the darker side of the changes that Attenborough has seen in 60 years. Just as we are learning more and more about the glories of the living world, and as new breath-taking visions are being brought into our homes, we are destroying these wonders at an accelerating rate. It is a simple question of numbers, says Attenborough. \"There is no problem on Earth that could not be solved quite easily if you could reduce world population. The reason that oil palms are being planted all over the place is because there are so many mouths, so many people in the west offering to pay for these forests to be cut down and palms planted for margarine, for plastics.\"</p> <p>Plastic refuse turns out to be a particular concern for Attenborough, who is working on a film that will highlight the crises facing our oceans. \"It is just tragic,\" says Attenborough. \"You have got an albatross that comes back to feed its young. In close-up, it regurgitates the stuff it has been collecting round the world's oceans for 10 days to feed its chicks and what comes out? Bits of plastic. And then you see the chicks swallowing this plastic. If you warm the plastic, it gives off dioxins. And the litter of this stuff. You can only get rid of it if you can burn it \u2013 and then it gets worse.\"</p> <p>It is a grim picture, though Attenborough is not without some shred of optimism. \"If I have to grasp for little threads of hope, one is that humans are going to be better informed about the state of the world than they have ever been in the planet's history. Kids in Tibet are going to be talking to people in Patagonia about what is happening to the Earth and there is a chance that a worldwide, slow protest movement will grow with younger people wanting something to be done.\"</p> <p>Much of their awareness of the living world and the perils facing its wildlife will have come from Attenborough, of course. In the past, he was criticised for not making clear his position on global warming, and for not taking on those who deny that climate change is occurring. However, in the past few years, he has been far more explicit in his warnings about the dangers our planet faces as it warms up and the polar regions melt.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, these attempts at enlightenment have brought him into conflict with those who reject the idea that the Earth is in peril. For example, in the final episode of his last major series, <em>Frozen Planet</em>, Attenborough highlighted the impact of global warming on the polar regions. He pointed out that summer sea ice cover has declined by more than 30% over the past few decades and is causing major disruptions to the wildlife.</p> <p>Nigel Lawson, former chancellor and leading climate-change denier, was unamused. \"Sir David's alarmism is sheer speculation,\" he claimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/03/david-attenborough-frozen-planet-climate-change\" title=\"\">after the programme was transmitted last year</a>. \"When it comes to global warming, [Attenborough] seems to prefer sensation to objectivity.\" Attenborough, said Lawson, should have acknowledged that although the extent of Arctic sea ice has been declining over the past 30 years, satellite observations have also shown that, at the other pole, Antarctic sea ice has been expanding over the same period.</p> <p>Sensationalism is not an accusation that many have made about Attenborough in the past. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and was awarded the Order of Merit in 2005. He does not, generally, shoot his mouth off and many scientists were quick to jump to his defence. These included oceanographers who pointed out that yes, summer sea ice in Antarctica has increased over the past 30 years, but only slightly \u2013 by about 0.4 million square kilometres, an upward trend that may actually be no more than a reflection of year-to-year variability. By contrast summer sea ice in the Arctic has declined in extent by about 3 million square kilometres in the past 30 years: a vast decrease. Lawson was guilty of being economical with the truth, to put it mildly.</p> <p>So what does Attenborough think about climate change deniers like Lawson? What should be done to counter their highly selective views about global warming?</p> <p>\"Well, it is difficult to know what to say except that people like him have to be allowed to make these claims so that others can assess them. Any idea of suppressing their views would be disastrous. We need to be able to see just how wrong-headed they are and how selective they are in picking data to support their ideas. They pinpoint examples to say global warming cannot be happening because it got colder in some area of the planet. That is the sort of thing they say. But, of course, that completely misunderstands the global nature of the crisis we are facing. We have to keep pointing that out. Certainly I think that most people would recognise that Lawson is up a gum tree.</p> <p>\"The truth is: the natural world is changing. And we are totally dependent on that world. It provides our food, water and air. It is the most precious thing we have and we need to defend it.\"</p> <p>Attenborough: 60 Years in the Wild<em> begins on BBC2 on 16 November at 9pm</em></p>",
  "<p>President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande will meet the heads of global economic organisations for crisis talks on Monday after suffering a series of damaging economic blows in what was his worst week since taking power five months ago.</p> <p>The French leader has been hit by soaring unemployment figures, further factory closures and job losses, and plummeting popularity on top of growing fears that he and his Socialist government are failing to address the country's problems. Members of the opposition right-of-centre UMP have accused them of being \"amateurs\".</p> <p>The meeting with chiefs of international organisations, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and World Trade Organisation, has been billed by the Elsy\u00e9e as a \"sharing of views\".</p> <p>However, sources told the <em>Observer</em> the economists will urge Hollande to press on with key structural reforms to improve France's competitiveness on the world market and restore confidence at home and abroad. World financial institutions are said to be encouraged by Hollande's efforts to reduce France's large public spending deficit, but are seeking more from the French leader.</p> <p>Herv\u00e9 Boulhol, a senior OECD economist, said France needed \"deep structural reforms\" to improve public and global confidence in the country. \"Then people will believe there is a clear political direction towards tackling unemployment, public spending and competitiveness. It is these three things that need to be addressed,\" he said.</p> <p>\"At the moment, France is just above average in Europe, but if we are to avoid the extreme situations other countries have found themselves in, one has to find a way out of this crisis. There's no room for complacency.\"</p> <p>As the French head off for an autumn break after weeks of increasingly gloomy news, commentators have warned of growing anguish and despair among voters and deep disillusionment with the country's Socialist government.</p> <p>\"People knew there would have to be, as Churchill said, blood, sweat and tears and this was never going to be popular,\" J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet from the opinion pollster Ifop, which carries out regular surveys of the public mood in France, said: \"They knew there would be tax rises and reforms, whoever was elected, and they were prepared to make the effort, even if painful, if it was worth it. But with the situation seemingly getting worse, people don't see a light at the end of the tunnel and Hollande is not providing one. This has made people pessimistic, anxious and fearful.\"</p> <p>The French, pollsters admit, have a tendency to be \"morose\", but the metaphor of an economically battered France as a ship in a storm taking on water, while passengers look desperately to the captain to save them, is often heard these days, along with concern that Hollande and his Socialist crew are not sufficiently experienced to handle the crisis.</p> <p>In such a climate, the slightest <em>faux pas</em> has created a full-blown tempest. Last week prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault suffered what was dubbed Black Wednesday after announcing the French Constitutional Court was to scupper a housing bill before the council had even sat down to decide. The government was bashed again for appearing to lobby against a report it had itself commissioned, on how to improve France's economic competitiveness and plug a trade deficit that reached a record \u20ac70bn (\u00a356bn) in 2011, after its author suggested a \"massive\" cut in business taxes.</p> <p>News that unemployment, having broken the 3 million barrier in August, had leaped by 46,900 in September, the highest monthly increase since 2009, plus more factory closures and layoffs, made the general gloom even murkier.</p> <p>Carine Marc\u00e9 of pollster TNS-Sofres, whose recent survey discovered that 70% of French people thought things could only get worse, said the daily bad news had created a vicious cycle.</p> <p>\"Every day there is the announcement of more job losses and people worry even when it doesn't affect them, because they think they're next. And when people are worried, they consume less and it becomes the snake biting its own tail.\" She added: \"The French have been morose for 30 years; Fran\u00e7ois Hollande fed them hope of things improving but the French had no great expectations. They knew their country had been hit by crisis and there was no magic solution.</p> <p>\"People are not convinced by the government, not convinced they are good enough. They used to say, 'France is not Greece or Spain', but now they are beginning to worry it is heading that way.\"</p> <p>Fourquet agreed that the popularity of the president and PM had suffered a \"brutal and spectacular fall\", but said the causes were mostly out of their control. \"The factors behind this are unemployment, redundancies, factory closures, the drop in spending power, the rising price of energy and petrol. All this weighs heavily on the morale of the French, but it's not just a problem in France.\"</p> <p>Laurence Sauvage, national secretary of the leftwing Parti de Gauche, describes the atmosphere in France as \"toxic\" and warned it was conducive to driving voters into the arms of the extreme-right Front National.</p> <p>\"The Left has incredible, historic power in France... but the government is not rising to the occasion,\" she said. \"It is sad to see how afraid and unhappy people are.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Fran\u00e7ois Hollande promised the time for change was now. But there's no change, just disillusion. If this continues, people will be beating a path to Marine Le Pen.\"</p>",
  "<p>A senior coalition figure puts it with stark profanity: \"If the economy comes right, Labour is fucked. If it doesn't come right, we're fucked.\" I wouldn't frame it quite like that myself. It is too determinist to think that elections turn solely on whether the growth figure is positive or negative. Governing parties in Britain have won in the shadow of recessions and they have lost when presiding over expansion. But the basic point is surely right: the economy will be far and away the single most important issue when the country next makes a choice of governors. More specifically, many voters will be hugely influenced by whether their household disposable incomes are rising or falling.</p> <p>Hence the rather desperate alacrity with which the prime minister and chancellor hailed the latest figures that suggested that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/george-osborne-recession\" title=\"\">economy</a> grew by 1% in the most recent quarter. Hence the welcome through gritted teeth that this news received from the Eds Balls and Miliband.</p> <p>Both sides have to be very careful about how they address a country feeling the pain of prolonged austerity. Labour ought to be wary of exposing itself to the Tory charge that it is talking down recovery or secretly hoping for continued misery. The coalition, frantic for something to boost morale after a terrible few months, has to guard against the impulse to greet any modest movement in a positive direction as a glorious new dawn, a temptation to which David Cameron is prone to succumb.</p> <p>In his early months as prime minister, back in October 2010, he seized on one quarter's growth figures to brag that Britain was \"out of the danger zone\" and firmly set on the road to recovery. Within months, the economy was shrinking again. Once burnt, the prime minister is not twice shy. Naughtily pre-empting the official publication of the latest figures, he cockily told the Commons that the good news would keep coming, a rather reckless hostage to future fortune when there are considerable internal and external risks that Britain could slide into negative territory for a third time, a triple-dipper.</p> <p>When trying to establish where the parties really stand with the public, the headline polling numbers are often not as informative as how voters answer the question: \"Who do you most trust with the economy?\" On the crucial issue of perceived economic competence, it is pretty much neck and neck between Labour and the Tories. There's an encouraging way of looking at this from a Labour point of view. The two Eds have closed what used to be a yawning deficit on this question. Two and a half years since Labour was ejected from office, having presided over the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, the party has clawed its way back to rough parity with the Conservatives on economic competence. But there is also a way of looking at this which makes Labour frontbenchers nervous.</p> <p>George Osborne has failed in the most important objective that he set himself. The central pillar of his original strategy \u2013 closing the budget deficit in a parliament \u2013 has no prospect of being achieved by the time of the next election. The original target date has already been put back by two years. Taxes have been hiked, spending squeezed and living standards crunched. Yet the governing party is still even-stevens with the opposition on economic competence and roughly 10 points behind in the headline poll numbers at midterm. Many governments have come back from much worse. Ken Clarke likes to remind younger Tory colleagues that he sat in Margaret Thatcher's government when Conservative support fell to 18% and they went on to win the 1983 election by a landslide.</p> <p>I don't encounter many Tories who think that is likely to happen. But I do meet quite a lot of Conservatives who believe that, if growth can be sustained and the government manages to look competent for a change, Labour's poll lead is very vulnerable. Senior figures in the Labour party think their Tory counterparts may be right and that current ratings are far more a reflection of the government's failings than of a settled desire in the country to put Labour back into power.</p> <p>There is a scenario that haunts some Labour frontbenchers. They sustain a poll lead all the way up to the threshold of the next election, only to lose it in the end because they had not dealt with the doubts about Labour nagging away at the electorate. The Conservatives are already practising their election themes. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19883045\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> played it for a laugh at the Tory conference in Birmingham, but it was a joke with deadly serious purpose, when he called David Cameron \"a broom\", George Osborne \"the dustpan\" and compared other senior ministers to household implements \"clearing up the mess left by the Labour government\".</p> <p>In recent days, the prime minister and chancellor have been rehearsing other lines. It has been tough going, the Tories will say, and a bigger task than we expected because the inheritance from Labour was even worse than we imagined. But we are getting it done; re-elect us to finish the job. That will be a core Tory message. They might campaign on the slogan: \"Britain's On The Right Track. Don't Turn Back.\" They already own the copyright on that one having used it successfully against Labour in the past. One shadow minister suggests the Tories might also steal a soundbite from American politics: \"Why hand the keys back to the guys who drove the car into the ditch?\" Like cheap music, cheap slogans can be potent. In the words of one Labour frontbencher, the Tories could have the makings of \"quite a compelling story\".</p> <p>To counter it effectively, Labour will need a better story of its own, especially if growth is looking solid by the time of the next election. One line Labour is currently pushing hard is that the Tories have already done lasting, irrecoverable damage to the economy, which has disadvantaged Britain against major international competitors.</p> <p>Ed Balls will pursue this theme with all the aggression for which he is famed, but the shadow chancellor also knows that it is very difficult to prove a counterfactual, a what might have been. Arguments about the past will probably matter less to voters at the next election than which of the parties seems to offer the best plan for the future. Labour will need a compelling case that it is better able to deliver jobs, rising incomes and enduring prosperity. There are unresolved tensions within the Labour high command about how to go about this. There is no open dissent from Ed Balls towards Ed Miliband's speeches about reforming capitalism, but colleagues don't come away from talking to the shadow chancellor with the impression that he burns with unbounded enthusiasm for this as a way of winning the confidence of voters. In the view of quite a lot of Labour MPs, ruminating about responsible capitalism is all very well, but also a bit too highfalutin. \"What people will want to know at the next election is how we are going to make them better off,\" says one member of the shadow cabinet.</p> <p>Another, equally stiff challenge for Labour is to answer the anxieties about its trustworthiness when it comes to the nation's finances. The Tories will ceaselessly repeat variations of David Cameron's conference line: \"Labour: the party of one notion \u2013 more borrowing.\" The sort of questions in voters' minds are well put by one senior Labour figure: \"Will they always go for the short-term fix? Will they just throw money at problems and give in to vested interests?\"</p> <p>The two Eds have one main answer to this at the moment. That is to get themselves booed by trade union audiences at every opportunity by telling them that they won't be able to reverse everything done by the coalition and warning that a Labour government will also have to inflict cuts.</p> <p>That's probably quite useful in improving their fiscal credentials with sceptical voters, but far from sufficient really to establish trust in Labour. There is a range of options on fiscal discipline. At the most astringent end of the spectrum, Labour could commit itself to introducing an American-style law setting a debt ceiling. This would oblige the government to ask for Parliament's permission every time it wants to raise borrowing. I'm not persuaded they will go that far, but they will certainly need something very firm and convincing to win this part of the argument with their opponents.</p> <p>Another crucial task for Labour is to impress the public that it would spend wisely and well. This demands some hard, imaginative and brave thinking about ways to sustain public services on reduced budgets. Labour's team could also be doing a lot more to try to convince the public that they are resolved to extract the maximum return from every pound of taxpayers' money. The party's frontbenchers would be smart to seize every opportunity they get to talk about how they would reduce waste and eliminate inefficiencies.</p> <p>The two Eds can be forgiven for not knowing what the economy will look like in 2015. No one does. But there is no excuse for not preparing for how the Tories will fight the election. Because they keep telling us.</p>",
  "<p>I'd have been sceptical if someone had told me five years ago, when I first started work on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/david-adjaye-tops-powerlist-2013\" title=\"\">Powerlist: Britain's Most Influential Black People</a>, that three of our launches would be attended by the prime minister of the day (Gordon Brown twice and David Cameron last Thursday). More so, to be told that it would lead to the setting up of a charity, the trustees of which are some of the country's leading lights in their respective fields.</p> <p>But it has done all that and more and seems to have taken on a life of its own now. When we launched in 2008, the initial idea was to showcase how success for black Britons was not confined to sport and entertainment. We wanted black kids to look up to other people \u2013 in the professions and beyond.</p> <p>As the prime minister writes in this year's Powerlist: \"We should never underestimate the power of role models. When teenagers see high achievers who look like them, who have reached the top in law, business, politics, they're going to think, 'I can do that; I can go far too.'\" It's why we send thousands of copies, most paid for by the people on the list, to schools.</p> <p>We are also keen that people of other ethnicities are also made aware of the list. Most racism is born of ignorance and a lack of respect. Challenging negative stereotypes can change perceptions. To survive, the Powerlist has to be dynamic and over the years we have unearthed more and more great people.</p> <p>In 2008, Dr Mo Ibrahim, the billionaire philanthropist, topped the list when most people had never heard of him. Baroness Scotland, the then attorney general, headed it the following year and she was succeeded, for two years running, by Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Prudential. This year, David Adjaye, whom President Obama refers to as his favourite architect, is at number one on the list, selected by a panel of independent judges working from a definition of influence as \"the ability to alter events and change lives in a positive way\".</p> <p>His top position is particularly significant because Adjaye is essentially a builder and the Powerlist Foundation, the aforementioned charity, is planning to build a free school that will open in 2015. It will be an A-level college, with a particular focus on leadership, located in inner London. Its intake will be children from disadvantaged backgrounds who have leadership potential that may otherwise go untapped. Our mission is to give them a boost in line with our motto: \"Sharing success with tomorrow's leaders\".</p> <p>The future? We've already launched a publication called <em>Future Leaders</em>, which profiles the best black university students and next year we'll put out a publication about women, which the charity will follow up with a leadership programme for young women at university. It'll be interesting to see where we are in another five years.</p> <p><em>Michael Eboda is the founder and chief executive of Powerful Media Ltd.

  "<p>Saddam Hussein deposited \u00a3840,000 in a Swiss bank account belonging to the father of the British engineer murdered with his wife and mother-in-law in the Alps, it has been claimed.</p> <p>Saad al-Hilli, 50, has been linked to the former Iraqi dictator through his father Kadhim, who was once close to the tyrant's Ba'ath party but fled his homeland for Britain in the 1970s. The money was reportedly deposited into an account in Geneva, an hour's drive from where the massacre took place on 5 September at a remote spot near Lake Annecy in eastern France.</p> <p>Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and his mother-in-law were shot while his seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, was left badly injured and her four-year-old sister, Zeena, deeply traumatised. A French cyclist was also shot dead and the motive for the killings remains a mystery.</p> <p>A French police source revealed that the money had been traced to Hussein by the German intelligence agency, the BND, according to Le Monde. Agents routinely monitored cash transactions with Baghdad as Germany did more business with the regime than any other country.</p> <p>An intelligence source in Munich was quoted as saying: \"They know the money trail, and they know how to follow it. They have spent decades monitoring money transactions between the west and Iraq. The BND is the first port of call in such circumstances.\"</p> <p>The BND said: \"We do not comment on operations.\"</p> <p>The Le Monde story was published under the headline \"The potential links between the al-Hillis and Saddam Hussein.\"</p> <p>It said: \"According to a French police source, the German secret service informed the gendarmerie's anti-terrorist branch that there were links between the al-Hilli family and Saddam Hussein's fortune. The tensions began after Saad al-Hilli's father [Kadhim] was struck off the list of beneficiaries of the former Iraqi dictator.\"</p> <p>When Kadhim died he left behind his considerable wealth in a will.</p> <p>Le Monde identifies the money in the Swiss bank account \u2013 and not the inheritance \u2013 that may have been at the centre of the conflict. Swiss investigators discovered the secret account earlier this month, but according to Le Monde<em> </em>they didn't make the link to Iraq.</p>",
  "<p>I am writing this in a state of what we must euphemistically call delicacy: I say \"must\" because, in our post-Leveson age, it is probably actionable to be drunk in charge of a newspaper column. But the facts are the facts. Earlier this morning, I opened one eye, carefully, just to check the world was still there. \"How are you feeling?\" I said to the person closest to me, although not necessarily in English; it was probably a bit more like: \"Hyu... fling?\" There was a long pause for consideration, then came the reply: \"Like something washed up on a beach.\"</p> <p>Things didn't get better with both eyes open. I note that I neglected to remove my makeup last night, so my pillow now resembles the Turin Shroud; also that my clothes were arranged on the floor in a manner that made it seem as though I had suddenly disappeared from inside them, perhaps as a result of spontaneous combustion. I half-wish I had gone up in smoke. I would of course have preferred to take a shower, but the prospect of the water hitting me seemed unbearably violent.</p> <p>I am clinging to two things: first, that typing with sunglasses on, to reduce the painful glare of the computer screen, is giving me a sort of Holly Golightly air; second, that a country mile into last night's proceedings, someone offered me a rogue brandy and I declined. Imagine if I'd said yes!</p> <p>Do bear with me. Although I realise that my skull-splitting nausea and booze-induced paranoia are not your problem, there is a point to all this. And it is this: that these sensations, while deeply unpleasant, are the result of an absolutely excellent time. And that the most excellent part of this excellent time was itself the result of \u2013 supply your own pun, I'm too weak \u2013 going off-piste.</p> <p>Oh, sure, the evening began as a very respectable affair. It was a friend's 50th birthday party and a few of us were having dinner in a lovely restaurant; his wife had even arranged for the menu to feature some of his favourite dishes. Delicious food and wine and chatter flowed. And then, the issue of Going On reared its head; it was deemed to be a Good Idea. Here are some of the highlights: a friend who's recently lost a lot of weight's trousers falling down; seeing a man off the telly in a nightclub and remarking loudly that he was shorter than we thought; queuing up in a strip-lit minicab office at three in the morning.</p> <p>I'm not sure I could have found the recipe for any of this in Pippa Middleton's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780718176785\" title=\"\"><em>Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities for Families and Friends</em></a>, published to much fanfare (and, as the papers pointed out, requiring its author to change into four different outfits to launch it).</p> <p>Organising an Easter egg hunt: check. Conjuring up an appropriately spooky Halloween party: check. Pimping a plate of scrambled eggs with some \"inexpensive\" caviar: erm, check. But keeping a group of middle-aged thrill-seekers not used to being out so late on the straight and narrow: unfortunately, un-check.</p> <p>Isn't this the way it should be, though? Should celebrations ever, really, be \"organised\"? Obviously, if your family runs a party-planning business, as Middleton's does, you will answer in the affirmative; ditto if you are an exceptionally efficient person who likes nothing better than a clipboard full of spreadsheets revealing when the canapes go into the oven and who's on cloakroom duty. For the rest of us, throwing a party is more a matter of stowing the breakables on top of the wardrobe, buying four giant tubs of hummus and hoping that our friends still actually like us enough to miss <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/02/breaking-bad-a-beginners-guide\" title=\"\"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>.</p> <p>This narrative does not suit the professionalisation of enjoyment, however, which dictates that our conviviality be calendarised so that we can go from Bonfire night to Thanksgiving to Christmas and new year to Burns supper to Valentine's Day \u2013 and on and on \u2013 with our lives measured out in so many occasion-appropriate punchbowls and playlists. I say mix it up a bit: toss a pancake on the Fourth of July!</p> <p>Or, better still, just go out and get someone else to do it. Here's my party advice: find some people you like, eat a bit, drink a bit, dance a bit, laugh a lot. Do as I say, and not as I do, and do not over-indulge in any of the above. And with that, I'm going to go back to bed.</p>",
  "<p>Hoopla is only to be expected when there is a new James Bond movie in the offing and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/skyfall-review\" title=\"\"><em>Skyfall</em></a> has attracted more than its fair share for several reasons. It's the 50th anniversary of Bond on film, as well as make-or-break time for Daniel Craig after the poorly received <em>Quantum of Solace</em>. It has at its helm Sam Mendes, a director as respected in drama as he is untested in the action genre; and it arrives after the greatest promotional coup in British cinema \u2013a prime spot for Bond in the London Olympics opening ceremony.</p> <p>But the moments that elevate <em>Skyfall</em> from the efficient to the inspired can be attributed to one man: Javier Bardem, the hulking, 43-year-old Spanish actor whose delicious performance as Raoul Silva, sniggering cyber-terrorist, makes him a convincing contender for best Bond villain of all time.</p> <p>With his dandyish bleached locks and sinister omnipresence, Silva appears at first to be cut from familiar cloth. In fact, he is the most textured and sympathetic villain in the entire series. \"He's a peacock of a character, unlike anything Javier's played before,\" says Mendes. \"Canny and witty and flirtatious in a disturbing way that even I didn't expect.\"</p> <p>But then you don't cast an actor of Bardem's calibre as a thug. He is a three-time Oscar nominee, with one of those coveted statuettes to his name for playing a calm, remorseless killer in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/20/coenbrothers.thriller\" title=\"\"><em>No Country for Old Men</em></a>; keeping it company are assorted doorstops and bookends including a Bafta, a Golden Globe, the best actor prize from Cannes and five of Spain's Goya awards. He is highly discerning; his CV is littered with the names of outstanding directors, from Pedro Almod\u00f3var (<em>Live Flesh</em>) and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1les I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/30/biutiful-review-philip-french-bardem\" title=\"\"><em>Biutiful</em></a>) to Woody Allen (<em>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</em>) and Terrence Malick (<em>To the Wonder</em>).</p> <p>Bardem, Mendes explains, was not immediately sold on the idea: \"He was the one person who didn't say yes straight away.\" Mendes promised he could develop the character and says that many of the ideas - the way he looked, the hair colour - were Bardem's own. \"I thought they weren't going to work,\" says Mendes. \"All of them worked.\" Mendes certainly uses Bardem for maximum impact. The actor makes his entrance in <em>Skyfall </em>without fanfare or pyrotechnics; instead, he strolls slowly, even seductively, out of the distance and toward the camera in one long take. When he finally reaches Bond, he doesn't threaten him with any of the accoutrements of the supervillain; he opens Bond's shirt and trails his fingers across his chest.</p> <p>No one who is familiar with Bardem's work will be surprised at the charisma and complexity he lends to <em>Skyfall</em>. It was there in his earliest work, playing oversexed lugs in risque comedies such as <em>Jam\u00f3n Jam\u00f3n</em> and <em>Golden Balls</em>, where Bardem exhibited an unapologetic sexual energy. He brought as much intelligence to these goofball parts as he did later to his Oscar-nominated work as the persecuted Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jun/17/peterpreston\" title=\"\"><em>Before Night Falls</em></a> (which prompted Al Pacino to leave him an admiring answer phone message) or as a people trafficker in <em>Biutiful</em>, a performance championed during awards season by the likes of <a href=\"http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/01/05/julia-roberts-oscar-javier-bardem-biutiful/\" title=\"\">Julia Roberts</a> and Michael Mann.</p> <p>Despite the high esteem in which he is held in the US film industry, Bardem has divorced himself for the most part from the circus of celebrity. He lives now in Madrid with his wife, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, whom he married in the Bahamas in 2010, a union of Spain's two leading stars, and their one-year-old son, Leo.</p> <p>Bardem was born in 1969 into a family of actors stretching back to Mercedes Sampedro, a stage actor in the late 19th century. The clan's strong leftwing principles had on occasion landed them in trouble with the Franco&#xa0;regime. \"It was a very troubled time,\" according to Bardem, \"to the point that to have the surname Bardem in those times was not good; you were pursued and put in jail.\" His mother, uncle, grandfather and siblings have all&#xa0;performed professionally, but far from making him highfalutin or pretentious, this background instilled in Bardem a sense of pride and&#xa0;dedication.</p> <p>\"My grandparents saw a lot of ups and downs and I knew from them that the job could entail difficulties. The only thing to do is to concentrate on working hard.\" Indeed, he seems positively embarrassed by praise or attention. \"You want your work to be liked,\" he told me in 2008. \"But at the same time you can't let it all become about acclaim and approval. Awards feed the ego and you don't want that. You have to protect the acting.\"</p> <p>Although he had occasional roles in Spanish film and television during his childhood, Bardem's interests were not restricted to acting. He studied painting for four years and was also a member of Spain's national underage rugby team right up until <em>Jam\u00f3n Jam\u00f3n</em> brought him widespread recognition. Not that his distinctive misshapen nose is the result of a vindictive tackle: \"Some guy just came out of the blue in a bar when I was 19 and wanted to have some fun.\"</p> <p>His career had been building steadily in Spain throughout the 1990s, but it was Julian Schnabel's decision to cast him in <em>Before Night Falls</em> that changed his prospects overnight. It also required him to learn English. \"The differences between my Spanish acting and my English acting are fewer now,\" he noted, \"but I'll never be as comfortable in English. I just don't have the depth of history that I have with my own language.\"</p> <p>Fortunately, he is also renowned for his dynamic physicality. John Malkovich, who directed him in the political thriller <em>The Dancer Upstairs</em>, has described Bardem as possessing \"the strength and power of a bull, like a young G\u00e9rard Depardieu, but with a very masculine fragility underneath\".</p> <p>It's fascinating, then, that he seems drawn to parts that inhibit those natural strengths, forcing him into unfamiliar, uncomfortable situations.&#xa0;Take <em>Live Flesh</em>, in which he played a sexually insecure cop confined to a wheelchair. Or <em>The Sea Inside</em>, where his role as the real-life quadriplegic Ram\u00f3n Sampedro, who lobbied for the&#xa0;right to kill himself, required him to age 20 years and spend the entire film bedridden. Not since <em>Misery</em> confined the famously hyperactive James Caan to a similar fate had an actor's boundless energy been contained so perversely.</p> <p>\"The only reason I chose Javier was because he's the best actor in Spain,\" said the film's director, Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar. \"Everything else was against him. He had the charisma, that was important. But his body was too big and the ageing makeup was a nightmare. But he was just so good.\" It was a stunningly focused performance, though one Hollywood director confided to me that he thought Bardem had been too likable in the part \u2013 that he hadn't risked challenging the audience.</p> <p>The same charge could scarcely be levelled at him in the Coen brothers' film of Cormac McCarthy's <em>No Country for Old Men</em>. Even viewers too hardy to be perturbed by his portrayal of Anton Chigurh, the chillingly calm personification of evil, would surely have balked at his hairdo, a glossy, side-parted, unyielding bob. \"This rigid, almost mathematical haircut gives the impression that the guy is ordered but also insane. There must be something broken or out of sync in his mind for him to wear that hairstyle and&#xa0;think it's normal. It makes you wonder what's beneath the hair.\"</p> <p>Typically for Bardem, the part was important not for the acclaim it brought him but for what it helped him discover about himself. \"Actors are lucky; we get to express ourselves fully in our work. But the bad thing is that we have to confront the ghosts, the&#xa0;badness inside us, and not be afraid&#xa0;of that. Of course, I haven't killed anyone, but when I did this film&#xa0;I&#xa0;needed to face up to the violence&#xa0;that&#xa0;I bring with me.\"</p> <p><em>No Country for Old Men</em> provided Bardem with his widest audience yet, but it didn't alter the direction of his career and it's doubtful that the success of <em>Skyfall</em> will do so either. He's just finished shooting his next film, Ridley Scott's thriller <em>The Counselor</em>, alongside Cruz, Brad Pitt and Michael Fassbender; before that, we should get to see Malick's <em>To the Wonder</em>, in which&#xa0;he plays a priest suffering a crisis of faith.</p> <p>But if Bardem gets offered more blockbusters in the wake of playing Silva in <em>Skyfall</em>, he'll be no more likely to take them than he would have been before. Actors routinely tell the world that it's all about the work, that the fame and the money mean nothing, but&#xa0;Bardem is one of the few who can say it with conviction. The day he sells&#xa0;out and accepts a job for the money will probably be the day the sky&#xa0;falls.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's funding of Iran's anti-drugs trafficking programmes has been called into question after a UN watchdog expressed alarm at a sharp rise in the number of narcotics smugglers executed in the Islamic state.</p> <p>A new report by Christof Heyns, the UN's special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, spells out concerns that the flow of overseas aid to Iran has been followed by an increase in hangings.</p> <p>Iran executed 10 drug traffickers in Tehran last Monday. The men were convicted of trafficking more than a tonne of opium and a tonne of methamphetamine.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/15/britain-drugs-war-executions-iran\" title=\"\">reported last month</a> that the UK was one of five donor countries that, via the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), gave Iran almost \u00a32m to train sniffer dogs and buy specialised vehicles, satellite phones, drug-testing kits and body scanners to help combat drug smuggling. In 2009 the Foreign Office confirmed that it had spent more than \u00a33m between 2000 and 2009 providing counter-narcotics assistance in Iran .</p> <p>It is estimated that as many as 4,000 Afghans alone are on death row in Iran for drug offences. The UNODC has guidance stating that, if executions for drug-related offences continued, it would \"have no choice but to employ a temporary freeze or withdrawal of support\". However, the report states that UNODC and some states are actively involved in Iran, \"where more than 1,400 people have reportedly been executed since the beginning of 2010\".</p> <p>The UN rapporteur warns that countries such as the UK that co-operate with countries that practise the death penalty for drug trafficking face \"questions of complicity\". Rebecca Schleifer, advocacy director of the health and human rights division at Human Rights Watch, added: \"Assistance to drug control efforts in countries with draconian drug laws, secret trials with no appeal, and death sentences for possession of small amounts of drugs raises serious concerns about complicity in violations of the right to life.\"</p>",
  "<p>Those of us who worry about the old media have had a fraught week \u2013 and we're used to stress. The last few days have been up there with those anxious months in the 1480s when the bottom fell out of illuminated manuscripts. They've seen the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2012/oct/22/bbc-ceefax\" title=\"\">demise of Ceefax</a> \u2013 probably the most recent of all the old media, a brand spanking new old medium, hardly conceived before it was careering towards obsolescence. Useful, if clunky \u2013 like a seatbelt but it didn't save lives \u2013 this valiant example of British innovation will be sadly missed and reminds us that not everything that came out of the BBC in the 1970s is tinged with rape.</p> <p>Worse than that, the most powerful journalist in the world has quit. It emerged last week that Clark Kent, aka Superman, is to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2012/oct/24/supermans-clark-kent-quits-job-video\" title=\"\">leave his reporting job</a> in the forthcoming issue of the comic. Initially I assumed he was protesting against all the nasty commenters on the <em>Daily Planet</em> website: the thousands calling him an arsehole without having paid for the paper, or complaining that he only got to save the world because of his posh upbringing on Krypton. But apparently not: as well as his other powers, Superman is super-thick-skinned and embraces the internet age. He's off to work in new media and, according to Scott Lobdell, the writer of the series, is \"likely to start the next <em>Huffington Post</em>\".</p> <p>Presumably Kent originally chose to work in the print media in order to be at the beating heart of news, so he'd find out about impending world crises and sport before his fellow citizens and would consequently be best placed to save their lives. But, as the under-resourced <em>Daily Planet</em> came increasingly to rely on stories cobbled together from Twitter, the giving out of free DVDs and endless pages of comment, Kent's disillusionment must have grown. The last straw was a disagreement with proprietor Morgan Edge over his preference for celebrity gossip over hard news. Apparently they'd also just given some comedian a column.</p> <p>Superman will be all right, of course. If his internet start-up founders, he could reboot his career on <em>Dancing with the Stars</em>. But, in an era of crumbling institutions, where will the fictional heroes they once sheltered end up? What hovels will they fashion for themselves in the entrepreneurial rubble?</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Olsen becomes a pap</strong><br></h2> <p>The <em>Daily Planet</em>'s keen young photojournalist has long since noticed which way the technological wind is blowing and gone freelance. With his digital camera and close working relationship with Superman, he can sell pictures of world disasters to the highest bidder. \"No sooner has Superman heard that there's a bus about to fall off a suspension bridge than we're there: Superman rescues the bus while I see if I can get up-the-skirt shots of the flustered passengers. People really lose their sense of modesty when they think they're about to die.

Increasingly disillusioned with the police force post-Hillsborough, Morse does an IT course, moves to the Isle of Skye and tries to make a living designing cryptic-crossword- and real-ale-based smartphone apps.</p> <h2><strong>Mary Poppins works in PR</strong><br></h2> <p>Preferring to leave the tedium of caring for other people's children to those who are trying to obtain residency rights, the former magical nanny is forging a very successful career since founding Practically Perfect PR. \"There are two types of PR company,\" she explains. \"Those who tell people about events, movies, shows and products that are already very popular and don't really need PR, and those who fail to tell them about those that aren't and do.

The <em>Panorama</em> programme came out in 1963, a year after Rachman's death. It gave a portrait of him that has survived: as an opportunistic, money-crazed racketeer who housed tenants in appalling conditions and thought nothing of evicting them by using bully boys and dogs.</p> <p>In <strong>The Real Rachman: Lord of the Slums</strong>, Joshua Levine took that <em>Panorama</em> portrayal and revealed it as biased and flawed. (I'd bang my irony drum, but it's feeling a bit battered these days.) He spoke to tenants, some of whom were grateful to Rachman for housing them at all \u2013 he operated during the dark days of \"No blacks, no Irish, no dogs, no children\" \u2013 others who thought he'd forced them out. Levine also spoke to Mandy Rice-Davies, who had an affair with Rachman, when she was 16 and he 39. She told his backstory, that of a Polish Jew in the first part of the 20th century: brother and parents killed by the Nazis, Rachman himself forced to work on a chain gang and live in a concentration camp in the evenings. He escaped and fought for the Allies as part of the Polish Corps. Rice-Davies cried because she had such pity for him.</p> <p>Levine's programme was fascinating and thoroughly entertaining, though not as clear-cut as he had perhaps hoped. Rachman was indeed an opportunist and exploiter, but he was also sentimental, made very little money from his empire and his bully-boy tactics were actually carried out by Michael de Freitas (who eventually became controversial black power leader Michael X, a man worthy of an entire series in himself).</p> <p>The sad thing was that Rachman fitted a nasty Jewish stereotype that still had resonance, despite the Nazi horrors. Plus, it is easy to blacken a man's name once he's dead.</p> <p>Which brings us, yet again, to revolting Jimmy Savile, whose reputation is, deservedly, drowning at the bottom of a murky pit. If he were alive, we wouldn't hear so much about his offences, for fear of libel. But the story seems to have become less about him and more about the BBC; last week, I couldn't switch on Radio 4 or 5Live, so saturated were those stations with corporation angst and breast-beating.</p> <p>Actually, as explained in Joshua Rozenberg's <strong>Law in Action</strong>, there can be no criminal case against the BBC. But there could be a civil case, based on whether the BBC could have prevented Savile's abuse. Did it have sufficient knowledge that the abuse may have been happening? Could the statute of limitations be overturned? (A claim has to be brought within three years from the date of the abuse or, if the victim was underage, three years from when they turned 18.) Yes, if the reason for the delay was the impact of the abuse itself. An ex-lawyer's advice for the BBC? \"They should be going to their solicitors.\"</p> <p>So, a lot <em>around</em> the Savile story last week. Not so much about the victims. When we did hear from them, it shocked. Savile's great-niece, Caroline Robinson, came on to <strong>Victoria Derbyshire</strong>'s programme on Thursday. She explained that she was abused twice by Savile, when she was 12 and 15, both times at busy, well-attended family parties. She told her grandmother \u2013 Savile's sister \u2013 after the first time. Her reply: \"Oh it's only Jimmy, it doesn't matter.\"</p> <p>\"I went outside and was sick,\" said Caroline, after the second time. \"When I went home I had a bath. And I couldn't wash his smell away.\"</p>",
  "<p>This has been quite a week in that strange, frenetic universe known as techworld. Two major companies did things that they once vowed they'd never do: Apple launched a small iPad in order to attack similar-sized devices marketed by its rivals \u2013 Samsung, Google and Amazon \u2013 and Microsoft launched the first computer it's ever made (a tablet called Surface). So we have Apple playing catch-up and Microsoft getting into a business \u2013 hardware manufacture \u2013 it had hitherto wisely avoided.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/oct/23/ipad-mini-launch-live-coverage-apple\" title=\"\">Apple launch</a> followed the usual pattern: slick presentations by chaps with chronic logorrhea \u2013 at least in relation to the word \"amazing\"; a complaisant audience drawn from the Church of Steve; and announcements of improved versions of existing Apple products. There's a new laptop with a Retina (ultra high-resolution) display, a new Mac mini (a much underrated product IMHO) and an iMac desktop so thin as to be positively anorexic. All nice and dandy \u2013 not to mention expensive.</p> <p>But then came one departure from tradition. Just over 55 minutes into the show, as Phil Schiller, Apple's senior marketing guy, was extolling the virtues of the new iPad mini, he suddenly launched into what in industry parlance is known as trashtalk. He embarked on a scathing comparison of le nouvel iPad with \"an Android tablet\", sneeringly dubbed \"the latest, greatest, most favourably reviewed new device\", aka the Google Nexus 7. Needless to say, the Apple product was superior in every respect. Its bezel was thinner and made of aluminium, not (yuck!) \"plastic\". The Google device was \"thicker and heavier even though it has a smaller screen\", etc etc. You get the message: Nexus 7 may be the same size as the iPad mini, but basically it's trash. (He omitted to mention that the Google device is also at least \u00a3100 cheaper than its Apple counterpart.)</p> <p>As an iPad user who has also been using a Nexus 7 for months, I happen to agree with Schiller about the deficiencies of the Google product. It's excellent for some things (email, Evernote, diary keeping, for example) but unsatisfactory for others (web-browsing in particular). Its onscreen keyboard is, well, a bit flaky. And the standard of Android apps is pretty variable. On the other hand, it's well-made and is relatively good value for money. In technology, as in life, you get what you pay for.</p> <p>What made Schiller's attack on the Nexus intriguing was not its content but the fact that he felt the need to make it. It signified a descent from the lofty heights to which Steve Jobs had elevated Apple, so far ahead of the competition that it didn't condescend even to admit its existence. And this subtext suggests that although Apple comprehensively dominates the market for high-end tablets that it effectively created with the iPad, it's now trying to keep up with the market for smaller, pocketable devices. One of the most important advantages of the Nexus 7, for example, is that it really does slip into a jacket pocket. (The same goes for Samsung and Amazon tablets.) In many contexts, that's actually quite useful, which is how Apple comes to be doing something that must be making Steve Jobs rotate in his grave: playing catch-up.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in another part of the forest, Microsoft was launching the first computer it has ever made in the form of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/24/microsoft-surface-thumbs-down-early-reviews\" title=\"\">Surface tablet</a>. This was intriguing in several ways. For one thing, it suggests that the software giant has finally concluded that Steve Jobs was right all along: that in order to make consumer-friendly computers one must control both the hardware and the software. The odd thing, though, is that the bit of the package it seems to have got right is the hardware. \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/technology/personaltech/microsoft-unveils-the-surface-its-first-tablet-review.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Sleek Tablet but Clumsy Software</a>\" is how David Pogue, the <em>New York Times</em> technology columnist, summed it up, echoing early industry reactions to the device. \"You have to be fairly cold-blooded,\" Pogue writes, \"to keep your pulse down the first time you see the Surface: its beauty, its potential, its instant transformation from tablet to PC. How incredible that this bold, envelope-pushing design came from Microsoft, a company that for years produced only feeble imitations of other companies' fresh ideas. And how ironic that what lets the Surface down is supposedly Microsoft's speciality: software.\"</p> <p>I don't have a dog in this fight, but I hope Microsoft gets its tablet act together. In the end, the only thing that keeps big technology companies honest is real competition. I don't want to live in an Apple-dominated world any more than I liked living in a Microsoft-dominated one. Which means, I guess, I will never get an invitation to a Phil Schiller superlatives-fest. In which case, virtue will be its own reward.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Old Bengal Warehouse, 16B New Street, London EC2 (020 3503 0790). Meal for two, including wine and service \u00a3130</strong></p> <p>Before mounting the case for the prosecution it is, I think, sometimes worth getting the mitigation in first. D&amp;D London, the vast restaurant group now named after David Lowe and Des Gunewardena, who took control of the company when Sir Terrence Conran stepped back a few years ago, is serious about what it does. The determination to democratise good food which inspired the business at the beginning with launches such as Le Pont de la Tour and the Blueprint Caf\u00e9, is still present in everything they do. After a period of expansion through acquisition they have just launched four restaurants, two in their newly opened South Place Hotel at Moorgate and two more in London's oldest surviving warehouse, built by the East India Company in the 1770s. The Old Bengal Warehouse, near Liverpool Street Station, is home to a bar and two restaurants, one specialising in fish, one specialising in meat.</p> <p>There is a cast-iron law which says that the interior of a proper fish restaurant must, wherever possible, look something like a trawler; it must be at least a&#xa0;little rough hewn and industrial, as if they have just sluiced out the fish guts. (This rule does not apply to steak restaurants. Nobody expects them to look like abattoirs.)</p> <p>Fish Market does not break the rule. There are hefty metal columns and many hard surfaces and a ducted ceiling. There is a bar for eating at, with a modest fish display; size isn't everything but with a place like this it's nice to get a serious eye full of the offering, red in claw, beady of eye. The menu reads fine, with a list of crustacea, a couple of potted options, a small choice of oysters and then a bunch of starters and mains that would make you nod slowly with recognition.</p> <p>We'll leave those for the moment and deal with the key issue which is attention to detail. For if you were making that case for the prosecution the evidence would sit in three side dishes. First up, a salad of \"heritage tomato, shallots, olive oil\". It's a&#xa0;simple proposition. It's so bloody simple there is absolutely nowhere to hide. It depends on those tomatoes being as pert and taut as a Russian oligarch's botoxed girlfriend. These were like cotton wool. They were all squelch and suck. It baffles me how any kitchen can taste tomatoes like that and conclude it's OK to serve them. Item two: a side of broccoli, anchovy and chilli. Deathly, over-boiled broccoli, very little smack of chilli, no sign of anchovy at all. It tasted like leftovers made by someone who didn't like broccoli. Finally, triple-cooked chips. You cooked these three times? Really? What did you use? A&#xa0;humidifier? Triple cooking refers to a specific process, developed by Heston Blumenthal, involving parboiling followed by twice frying, and requires something thick cut. These were skinny and undercooked.</p> <p>The failure to get this sort of stuff right matters because Fish Market is not as cheap as properly cooked chips. A lobster cocktail was nice, but stiffly priced at \u00a311.50 for the amount of meat in it, and \u00a310.50 for six slightly under-seasoned queenie scallops, gratinated on their shell, felt like an enthusiastic mark up. The best value was a whole sea bass, taken off the bone, grilled and served with an expert sauce vierge of chopped tomatoes, lemon juice and basil. This, for \u00a320, seemed pretty fair. A&#xa0;good Bakewell tart and a&#xa0;crisp-shelled apple pie were better value at a&#xa0;fiver each.</p> <p>The point remains, though. You can charge stiffly for great sea food; given the issues around supply and sustainability it has no claims on cheapness. But the whole experience has to be spot on. D&amp;D London may have some great restaurants in its porfolio. But none of that excuses a&#xa0;tragic bowl of flabby chips.</p>",
  "<h2>Give me shelter<br></h2> <p>We garden in a relatively benign climate and our gardens reflect our desire to push the boundaries. Plants from all over the world and wildly different climates are jumbled together as a matter of course, but if you want to protect the most tender now is the time to do so. South American cannas and dahlias can stay outside in the ground in milder areas, but mulch the tubers with fallen leaves or a pile of compost. Lift and store in a frost-free shed if necessary. \"Hardy\" banana, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_basjoo\" title=\"\"><em>Musa basjoo</em></a>, should be mulched or wrapped with bubblewrap, and tree ferns wrapped in their entirety in colder areas.</p> <p>Mediterranean shrubs that like it on the dry side will appreciate having fallen leaves pulled away from their collars so that the air can move freely around them. Wet and cold is lethal in combination, so put cloches over the alpines that would usually be protected by snow and make use of the frame to keep cuttings and this year's seedlings on the dry side.</p> <p>Set pots on chocks so that they drain freely and wrap terracotta with bubble-wrap to prevent it from shattering. Bring containers of tender plants close to the house or into the shelter of a hedge to reduce the impact of the cold. Bring in any tender perennials if you haven't done so already. Pelargoniums can be blacked overnight once frost strikes.</p> <p>Wind can whip around plants that haven't entirely lost their foliage so reduce the longest growth on roses by half to a third to inhibit wind rock. The same can be said of <a href=\"http://www.rhs.org.uk/Gardens/Rosemoor/About-Rosemoor/Plant-of-the-month/August/Buddleja-davidii--Dartmoor-\" title=\"\">buddleia</a>. Cuts can be economic and quick with a thorough review when pruning on the other side of the winter.</p> <h2>Brassica alert</h2> <p>Pigeons are as decimating as a winter gale once they have sought out the winter greens. Net cabbages, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/cavolo_nero\" title=\"\"><em>Cavolo nero</em></a>, sprouts and broccoli, but check nets regularly in case you trap a curious blackbird.</p> <h2>Garlic and broad beans<br></h2> <p>If you haven't done so already, plant garlic and broad beans, as soil temperatures are plummeting. Always buy certified stock that is virus free rather than breaking up a bulb from the supermarket.</p> <h2>Tulip service</h2> <p>All your spring bulbs should be in the ground by now, but you have the best part of the month to get the tulips planted as they prefer to go in late. You can leave it into December, but results will be diminished as they like to get their roots established to be able to cope with the wet and the cold in combination.</p> <h2>Mulching orders</h2> <p>If the weather is still mild and you like to get the garden tidy before winter, mulch any bare soil with an eiderdown of compost or well-rotted manure. It will protect it from the elements over the coming months.</p> <p>I prefer to let things run their course and only cut away what vegetation I need to, to appreciate winter skeletons and to leave plants as habitats for beneficial insects or for the birds to strip them of seed in inclement weather. Sunflowers will be left standing where they are in the vegetable garden, and the fennel and eryngium in the borders. Fallen leaves will only be cleared on grass and among plants, such as lavender, that appreciate free air movement.</p> <p>Order in compost if you haven't already. Mulching in areas where there are bulbs means you will be ahead of the game in a mild spell.</p> <h2>Lawns and mowers</h2> <p>Rake the last of the leaves off the lawns and only put the mower away once temperatures fall beneath 5C, as the grass will still be growing above this temperature. When putting your equipment into winter storage, drain machines down as unleaded petrol doesn't keep, and put them away clean with an oiling in the right places for a snappy start come the spring.</p>",
  "<p>At the end of a dinner created by triple Michelin-starred chef Yannick All\u00e9no, served to a&#xa0;table of 100 against the surreal backdrop of Harrods menswear department, a young man rises to speak to the assembled guests. His audience, which includes supermodels David Gandy and Eva Herzigova, gallerist Jay Jopling as well as artist Dinos Chapman and editors Jefferson Hack and Suzy Menkes, have gathered to celebrate the relaunch of <a href=\"http://berluti.com\" title=\"\">Berluti</a> as a&#xa0;major luxury menswear brand. The French leather goods label is 127 years old, but the CEO who stands before us is 35.</p> <p>His face is rounder, his fringe is floppier and he is, of course, much younger than you'd imagine a CEO to be. But the room falls silent as he recounts an anecdote about his first Berluti shoes, which his father gave to him when he was 17. He was going through a rebellious phase, \"listening to Nirvana\", so he barely wore them. But he kept them, quietly proud to own something so beautiful. Now the father who gave him those shoes has put him in charge of the brand. He says he's determined to honour that idea of an heirloom. He promises that he will never compromise on the quality. The room applauds and the waiters surge forward to fill glasses with Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem Sauternes 2006. I slip away, and finally manage to get a cab when Bryan Ferry relinquishes his so I can get home.</p> <p>I want an early(ish) night because I'm meeting Antoine Arnault, CEO of Berluti, at 9am the next day at Hotel Bulgari in Knightsbridge. The Arnaults, who hail from Roubaix in northern France, are the most influential family in global fashion. Their holdings company, Groupe Arnault, is the majority shareholder in Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA \u2013 better known as LVMH, the luxury goods conglomerate which runs Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Fendi, Veuve Clicquot, Tag Heuer and Guerlain to name but a few of the 60-plus brands that fall under its grand umbrella. The father he talked about so fondly last night is Bernard Arnault, according to <em>Forbes</em> magazine the fourth richest person in the world, with a net worth of $41bn. Bernard's empire started with Christian Dior, acquired in 1984, and has grown through aggressive expansion and inspired hiring (he is the man who pulled designers such as Marc Jacobs, John Galliano and Alexander McQueen on to the international stage) to become the largest luxury-goods group in the world. Sales are expected to hit $33bn this year.</p> <p>Antoine's older sister, Delphine, also works in the business. Having started at the smaller fashion labels Loewe and Pucci, she is now a&#xa0;director at Dior. Antoine started in the advertising department at Louis Vuitton and worked his way up to head of communications before becoming CEO at Berluti. He's also on the board of LVMH. Although the pair have three much younger siblings (from Bernard's second marriage to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist), at the moment it looks likely that one of them will become Bernard's heir apparent. \"We work hard,\" says Antoine. \"We were raised with real values about the importance of work and respect for the people. We're not in the gossip magazines playing strip billiards.\" Unlike Prince Harry, when Antoine goes to Vegas it's for poker \u2013 he's a world-class player. He dates a&#xa0;supermodel, but his relationship with Natalia Vodianova is very stable. The couple have just finished doing up their house in France.</p> <p>Normally it would be hard to imagine what Antoine's level of wealth feels like, but in the last 24 hours I've had a&#xa0;reasonable insight into his world. The Berluti party was catered by All\u00e9no, a chef who works at Cheval Blanc Courchevel, a&#xa0;French five-star hotel owned by LVMH, which Arnault assured me is absolutely lovely. We were served \u00a3300-a-bottle wine from Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem \u2013 the 14th-century vineyard is LVMH's oldest brand \u2013 and this morning we're in a suite at Hotel Bulgari which is, of course, five star, and, of course, owned by LVMH. \"It's very nice, <em>no</em>?\" says Arnault walking around the suite's living room. His enthusiasm when he talks about the hotels, last night's menu and how much he enjoyed the party feels completely genuine. He pauses to inspect a classic Arco floor lamp next to the sofa. \"I think this used to be mine, I'm sure I&#xa0;had it in my office, but I got a little bored of it\u2026\" He wanders off to greet Alessandro Sartori, Berluti's creative director.</p> <p>It is, of course, very easy to dismiss Arnault's appointment as nepotism. Bernard Arnault comes from a culture of family business (before he moved into fashion, he was the third generation of Arnaults to work in a real-estate business founded by his grandfather). But an empire like LVMH isn't built by doing family favours. And, although Berluti \u2013 a well-established brand with devoted customers \u2013 at first glance seems like an easy ride, it's a crucial development for the conglomerate and a&#xa0;huge amount of money has been invested in the project. LVMH's success is too dependant on Louis Vuitton: the fashion house brings in 37% of the group's sales. At some point sales will surely slow \u2013 to continue growth, LVMH has to diversify. The luxury menswear sector is currently one of the hottest growth areas in fashion, so relaunching Berluti as a clothing and lifestyle brand is a&#xa0;big deal, a potentially vital diversification. \"It's a good appointment for Berluti,\" says Honor Westnedge, a retail analyst at Verdict Research. \"It's not a well-known brand in America or the UK, so Antoine's background in marketing and communication gives him the perfect qualifications to refresh the brand and introduce it to new customers.\" Arnault's little anecdote about his first Berlutis may have been a nice soundbite for last night's dinner, but he clearly understand the brand's potential value.</p> <p>\"Berluti was untouched,\" he explains. \"LVMH bought it in the 1990s and it was one of the few brands that felt like an almost divine name, quite untouchable \u2013 and that's where you want a brand to be, in luxury it has to feel almost inaccessible. A pair of Berluti shoes has this flair, these nuances in colour and patina, so I thought: 'What if we took this <em>je ne sais quoi</em> and turn it into a menswear brand?' Also, we are not poets, huh? We're businessmen. We know this is a segment of the market which lacks a real good player, a house that allies to authenticity and tradition, but with style and sophistication. It's usually either or.\"</p> <p>The Berluti menswear collection created by Alessandro Sartori, who Arnault headhunted from Italian menswear label Z Zegna, launched this autumn and is certainly sophisticated. It's the epitome of how to create modern ultra-luxury. The clothes and leather goods have no logo \u2013 the range's only signature is a&#xa0;stitched slash, so only those in the know will recognise the brand. The clothes \u2013 in shades of slate, navy, mahogany \u2013 are heavy on silk, cashmere, double cashmere. The prices are just as remarkable. Shoes come relatively cheap, starting at \u00a3980, but you could spend more than \u00a322,000 on a crocodile-skin bag. Cashmere coats start at \u00a33,300. Obviously it's between you, your god and your bank manager whether you think paying these prices is obscene, an aspiration or something you do most weekends, but there's undeniably an international market for this level of luxury goods.</p> <p>\"It's an expensive pair of shoes,\" concedes Arnault. \"It's \u00a31,000. Why do people spend that on shoes? Well, for them it's not just shoes, it's a lifestyle, it's a message to the people around you. I think the LVMH portfolio has done well during this economic crisis because we make things right, we don't cheat. It's not indecent that these brands grow, it's because our customers think they're buying an asset, not a product.\"</p> <p>The prices may be elitist, but Arnault is adamant that the brand should be egalitarian. \"I&#xa0;think buying shoes is intimidating for a guy. Sitting down taking your shoes off, for men, it's too much. But you should never be intimidated by anything. If I see one of my sales assistants neglecting someone because he doesn't look like a good client, he's fired immediately. I hate it when those guys are pricks and don't say hello. Not least because it's a terrible mistake.</p> <p>\"I remember a while ago at the Venice Biennale, there was a beautiful Brancusi statue in one of the galleries and everyone had to wait to see it. This guy turned up and they told him to get a ticket and come back later. So the guy leaves, goes to the next stand and buys three Picassos \u2013 because it was Bill Gates. If that was the way it was for Gates, imagine how intimidating it would be for a regular guy to see the Brancusi. That's how I <em>don't</em> want things to be in my company. Because even if you can't buy, you're going to see beautiful products here \u2013 and one day when you can buy, well, we'll still be here.\"</p> <p>If you ever do want to spend significant money on luxury goods, if it isn't Arnault's brand you spend it with, well, it will probably be one that his family owns. Antoine says that fashion has always been part of his life and that he thinks his immersion in the market gives him a significant advantage.</p> <p>\"I was taught fashion very early, from the age of 12 when my father bought and created the group. We spent all our weekends in stores, speaking about brands, discussing advertising \u2013 I remember watching the adverts for [top-selling Dior perfumes] Poison, for Dolce Vita\u2026 is the music right? The edit? I had a couple of rebellious years when I didn't want to be bothered with it, but I very naturally came back to it. It's not a burden, you know? You're going to work in fashion, surrounded by creativity and beautiful people, beautiful objects \u2013 or work in banking. Well, you know\u2026 OK, I choose fashion. It was really a road that I was happy to drive down. The fact that we were initiated into it very early gave me and my sister Delphine a&#xa0;headstart. We feel things, brands, streets, we know where it's going to happen maybe a tiny bit before the others, so we use that.\"</p> <p>Arnault thinks the most important thing he has learnt from his father is the ability to communicate with designers properly \u2013 and that this is a&#xa0;key skill in the fashion business. \"I'm sorry, but designers are not artists. They may have the talent of one, but if they want to work in that way they should paint or sculpt. Here they're working in business and they need a&#xa0;brief. That's what my father does so well. I've witnessed him do it countless times and I'm really inspired by that. You know, towards the end, my father just couldn't talk to John Galliano at all, it was impossible \u2013 he wouldn't listen to anything. At that point, it crashes.\"</p> <p>I wonder if it's hard to work for his father \u2013 it must add an extra level of stress to performing well at work. He laughs heartily. \"Of course there's pressure, but I deserve absolutely no pity. It's a great life and a great job. It didn't arrive just like that\" \u2013 he snaps his fingers \u2013 \"I&#xa0;work hard and, yes, my father trusts me more and more and we're more involved in business decisions, but please don't feel sorry for me.\"</p> <p>I promise him, hand on heart, that I won't \u2013 which makes him laugh even more.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Price \u00a324,785</strong><br><strong>MPG 50.4</strong><br><strong>Top speed 120mph</strong></p> <p>The green-walled lanes of south Devon are a beautiful place to visit for a holiday. Bursting with flowers and alive with nature, the winding tracks are the arteries that keep Mother Nature in such rude health. But for your car these lanes offer no easygoing respite from the daily grind. They are a traumatising boot camp hell bent on sending your forecourt-fresh motor home in tatters. Thorns wait to lacerate your paintwork, gaping pot holes linger ready to devour your suspension, while those velvety, moss-covered boulders loiter in the damp verges primed to sabotage your sills. A&#xa0;week in Devon puts years on your car and will send it home distressed, tired and battered.</p> <p>The car I chose to inflict such punishment on was <a href=\"http://seat.co.uk\" title=\"\">Seat</a>'s all-conquering Alhambra \u2013 a tuff mudder if ever there was one. No nonsense, economical and business-like, Seat's large MPV is used to winning. Year in year out it cleans up when it comes to award time. Earlier this year it was named <a href=\"http://whatcar.com\" title=\"\"><em>What Car?</em></a>'s back-to-back MPV champion.</p> <p>It's not that I had a personal vendetta against the Alhambra, but it promised to do everything I needed it to. Room for seven adults: check. Huge boot: check. Five-star safety rating: check. Fifty miles to the gallon: check. Decent stereo: check. Engaging drive: check. Great looks\u2026 well, OK, it's not exactly a stunner. It simply looks like what it is: a mammoth, parsimonious people carrier.</p> <p>As probably the best-value large MPV on the road, most Alhambras have little more to look forward to than a life of servitude: long days and late-night minicabbing with the odd early-morning airport transfer thrown in for variety. But those that escape the rat race \u2013 to Devon, say, or to work uncomplainingly for a multi-child family \u2013 will reward you amply.</p> <p>All cars want to play the Tardis card: small on the outside, big on the inside. But the Alhambra trumps the rest. It's biggish on the outside and absolutely vast on the inside. Its boot is a yawning maw, ready to swallow, in my case, everything from surfboards to a portable barbecue, plus luggage for seven for a week. But like a large man holding in his stomach for that terrible family beach shot, the Alhambra takes up less space than it should. Its wheels are pushed out to the corners, and the rear doors slide rather than winging open \u2013 meaning you can squeeze into the smaller parking spaces and still actually get out of the car. And inside all five of the rear seats can fold flat to create enough space for a kingsize mattress. Combined with the full-length panoramic roof, you could stretch out on your back and look at the autumn rain falling with impunity.</p> <p>The square shape means visibility is superb and Seat has the handling of a much smaller, more agile car. With vehicles built for size, driveability can only really be seen as a bonus. The Alhambra steers well, offers a cushy ride and its eager 2-litre diesel is quiet, responsive and never whines (just like my children). And 50mpg, too \u2013 come on, that's a deal-closer.</p> <p>Should you buy one? Without doubt. The only problem is that you won't want to take a car you like so much on holiday.</p> <h2>Tyres to trees <br></h2> <p>Environmentally conscious motorists are being given the chance to turn their unwanted cars into newly planted trees. <a href=\"http://ScrapCarPlantTree.org.uk\" title=\"\">Scrap Car Plant Tree</a>, which launched this week, allows motorists to donate unwanted vehicles and uses the money raised through their disposal to plant trees in a city of their choice. The innovative and free-to-use recycling scheme enables people to offset their car's carbon footprint and offers the most environmentally friendly means of car disposal currently available in the UK. Money made from each disposal will go to UK charity Trees for Cities, which plants trees and creates green spaces throughout Britain's urban areas. Scrap Car Plant Tree expects to fund the planting of 13 saplings on average per disposal which will offset around a year's carbon emissions \u2013 although some vehicles will be able to provide significantly more. Collection of the vehicle is taken care of through the site and users are notified after the disposal just how much money was raised to fund urban tree planting.</p> <p>Alex Harvey from <a href=\"http://Giveacar.co.uk\" title=\"\">Giveacar.co.uk</a>, who manage the vehicle's disposal, said: \"We are thrilled to be part of an idea that will have such a positive impact on the way that people think about their end of life vehicles and the damage they may have done in their lifetime. Each car that is disposed of will offset at least one year's carbon emissions and vehicles which are auctioned could provide significantly more carbon relief, which can only be a good thing for the environment. Everybody is aware of how bad cars are for the environment so what better way to give something back than by funding the planting of new trees when getting rid of an unwanted vehicle?\"</p> <p>So, if your car has reached the end of the road and you would like to donate it, call 020 0011 1664 or visit <a href=\"http://ScrapCarPlantTree.org.uk\" title=\"\">ScrapCarPlantTree.org.uk</a>.</p> <h2>What's your favourite Bond car?</h2> <p>As <a href=\"http://skyfall-movie.com\" title=\"\"><em>Skyfall </em></a>unleashes the next wave of Bond madness (or Bond envy), those of us who are more interested in what 007 is driving than which evil mastermind he is saving the world from, will be weighing up that eternal question: what's your favourite Bond car?

  "<p>While November and December are the months in which the studios traditionally roll out their most prized awards contenders, there'll have to be an extraordinary surge of great movies between now and the new year to knock <strong>A Royal Affair</strong> (2012, Metrodome, 15) out of my top 10 for 2012. Boasting yet another mesmerising performance from the mercurial Mads Mikkelsen, this handsome costume drama manages to wrap a complex discussion of power, corruption and censorship around an engrossing and increasingly passionate romance. Called to the court of his apparently unhinged ruler, altruistic doctor and Voltairian free-thinker Johann Friedrich Struensee (Mikkelsen) inveigles his way into the hearts of both the king and queen, with potentially world-changing results. Wresting power from the landed gentry whose brutal mistreatment of the poor he has witnessed first hand, Struensee spurs the king to invest in social programmes that transform the nation's health. But when his illicit relationship with the queen (Alicia Vikander) becomes the stuff of scandalous satire, threatening to undermine his reforms, does the suppression of free speech become a justified means to an altruistic end? Does all power indeed corrupt?</p> <p>Inspired, but not bound, by historical record (director Nikolaj Arcel calls this adaptation of a well-rehearsed Danish story a \"fairy tale\" in which \"much more is true than you expect\"), <em>A Royal Affair</em> is a wonderfully layered film that dazzles the eye, quickens the heart, and challenges the intellect at every turn. While the title (and perhaps the publicity images) may seem off-puttingly fusty and staid, the drama itself is as vigorous and full-blooded as anything Danish film company Zentropa has produced throughout its unruly reign. Extras include interviews with Mikkelsen, Arcel and Vikander recorded at the Berlin film festival, where the movie premiered to justified acclaim \u2013 and awards \u2013 earlier this year.

They play once inseparable siblings upon whom fate plays a quasi-Shakespearean trick that sets them at loggerheads over the affections of a mutual male acquaintance (Mark Duplass). While the narrative may be schematic, the ultra-naturalistic performances and loose, intimate camerawork (by Benjamin Kasulke) keep the human interaction grounded in a credible reality. Far from being mere ciphers, this mismatched trio shape up as fully rounded characters, replete with raggedy edges, compromised needs, and (largely) entertaining foibles. With an eye for the importance of incidentals, Shelton appears to allow her actors free range to improvise while keeping a firm grip on the directorial rudder.</p> <p>Although an eye-catching title may grab an audience's attention, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cockneys-Zombies-DVD-Michelle-Ryan/dp/B008LU8MVK/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351073507&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Cockneys vs Zombies</strong></a> (2012, Studio Canal, 15) proves the importance of having a decent script in holding on to their interest. Unlike the dismal <em>Strippers vs Werewolves</em> (all title, no movie), this splattery romp from co-writer James Moran (who wrote the blackly comic <em>Severance</em>) boasts surprisingly coherent storytelling and fairly consistent laughs. When an old people's home, threatened with closure, is besieged by the walking dead, it's left to the younger generation to pull up their collective trousers and save the day. With such ever-watchable stalwarts as Honor Blackman, Dudley Sutton, Georgina Hale and Richard Briers in the cast, there's no shortage of colourful characters to keep the mood lively. Plaudits, too, to first-time feature director Matthias Hoene, who makes the most of a comic low-speed chase between shambling zombies and a walking-framed pensioner, which is a genuinely rib-tickling highlight. Shame&#xa0;about the comparisons to <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> and <em>Lock Stock\u2026</em> splashed on the cover, which do the film no favours at all.</p> <p>In Aleksei Fedorchenko's widely praised <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Silent-Souls-DVD-Yuliya-Aug/dp/B008ACGLUS/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351076999&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Silent Souls</strong></a> (2012, Artificial Eye, 15), two men revive the ancient death rites of their Merja heritage as they embark upon a road trip to honour the recent death of a beloved wife. En route, the bawdy memories are interspersed with flashbacks to pagan practices (tying coloured ribbons in the bride's pubic hair) and memories of bodies sensually bathed in vodka, with symbolic caged birds and impressively barren locales a constant background feature. Whether you find the sexual frankness of the men's morbidly lively conversation engaging or alienating is a matter of taste, but there seems to be no doubting the sincerity of this dour meditation upon love and death.</p>",
  "<p>Evidence suggests the colouring of hair goes back millennia. So why, after so long, can't we get it right? There are 50-plus shades to cover grey in every chemist, but it remains scandalously difficult to find a permanent dark hair dye containing ingredients with an unblemished safety record.</p> <p>This mirrors the problems with cosmetic production and is further evidence of a mainstream beauty sector besotted with cheap chemicals. Yes, I could happily rip through the average bathroom cabinet and get hot under the collar for a variety of ethical reasons, but today we'll stick with paraphenylenediamine (PPD), a material which essentially makes dark hair dye stick and which can be a potent allergen. Indeed, highly sensitive users have had gruesome allergic reactions and it has been linked to fatalities.</p> <p>PPD has been in use since the late-19th century. Some countries have flirted with banning it, and Sweden did from 1943 to 1992. On joining the EU Sweden relaxed the ban to conform with EU legislation. PPD is now allowed in concentrations of up to 6% in hair dyes across the EU.</p> <p>Is this wise? No official will categorically say PPD is unsafe. There is a lot of data: some of it inconclusive and some not very good. Tellingly, the Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS), which gives the thumbs up or down in the EU on consumer safety, cannot even muster a \"satisfactory\". An SCCS report from this summer also acknowledges that the frequency of allergic reactions from PPD \"remains a considerable concern for consumer safety\".</p> <p>One of the reasons cited for its continued presence in products (always check the ingredients list) is that there's no good alternative. This is a problem of consumer expectation. If you want intense colours that do not wash out you will be reliant on those containing PPDs. But there are lots of other beautiful colours without the same staying power that do not contain potential allergens. They are PPD-free and these are the ones I would advise using. Note, I'm not telling you to fade to grey (the obvious ethical option) not least because I wouldn't do it myself.</p> <p>If you're not a DIY-dye kind of girl, go to a salon that takes allergenic products seriously.

  "<p>\"Humorous Spanish books about cancer\" is probably a small section at your library. \"Humorous Spanish books about cancer that mention Gary Lineker\" is probably an even smaller sub-genre. In fact, it likely&#xa0;includes only this strange self\u2011help memoir.</p> <p>Aged 14, Albert Espinosa was a typical football-obsessed schoolboy from Barcelona. Then doctors found a malignant bone tumour in his left leg. His parents were told he had a 3% chance of survival and maybe a month to live. Just as they reached the airport to jet off for one last holiday together, the Espinosa family decided to turn back and fight. Albert spent the next decade in hospital, losing a leg, a lung and part of his liver. He learned to walk four times and endured gruelling amounts of chemotherapy \u2013 83 sessions, to be precise.</p> <p>By the time he was finally cured, aged 24, he'd written <em>El Mundo Amarillo</em> (<em>The Yellow World</em>), which the author insists is \"not about how to survive cancer but how to live\". It became a bestseller around Europe, shifting 1m copies. Now it's being published for the first time here.</p> <p>The best bits of this initially beguiling book aren't the self-help sections but the vivid portrait Espinosa paints of life on the cancer ward. Having lost their hair because of chemo, the young patients take ownership of their baldness, styling themselves as a cool gang called the Eggheads. They talk into the small hours, sharing pain-coping strategies and street wisdom. They'd visit the \"other Eggheads\" (newborn babies), have wheelchair races, escape outside to sunbathe or watch the 1990 World Cup (hence that Lineker name-check). \"I was happy when I had cancer,\" he writes. \"It was one of the best times of&#xa0;my life.\"</p> <p>The friendships formed in this environment are intense. Espinosa watched 22 fellow patients, mainly teenagers, die from the disease but is never maudlin about it. The Eggheads made a pact that \"if one of us were to die, we would share out their life\" by acting on their dying wishes. Espinosa now carries with him the desires and dreams of 3.7 friends.</p> <p>Warmly evocative and shot through with black humour, these tales reminded me of kids' caper films such as <em>Stand By Me</em>, <em>E.T.</em> or <em>The Goonies</em>. It's no coincidence Espinosa has turned them into a hit Catalan TV series, <em>Polseres Vermelles</em> (<em>Red Bracelets</em>). Steven <a href=\"http://www.catalannewsagency.com/news/culture/spielberg-produce-remake-catalan-public-television-series-%E2%80%98polseres-vermelles%E2%80%99-american\" title=\"\">Spielberg is now remaking it</a> under the title <em>The Red Band Society</em>.</p> <p>Hospital staff make vivid cameos. A 7ft-tall physiotherapist preaches \"the art of positive wanking\". A neurologist shows how to \"change his brain's factory settings\". A nurse strokes his big toe comfortingly. \"It was a bit sexy,\" he admits. A surgeon advises him to throw a farewell party for the leg he's about to lose. The night before the amputation, he does just that, inviting people with a connection to his left leg. They all tell stories about the limb, touch it and give it a send-off. He dances on it one last time. The next day, he'd \"lost a leg but gained a stump\". Having buried the leg, Espinosa says he's \"one of the few people who can literally say they've got one foot in the grave\".</p> <p>Less successful is the book's second half, where Epinosa espouses his \"philosophy for life\" based on his 23 \"discoveries\" during illness. This happy world he found is yellow because that's the colour of the sun. It's around this point that his naive style starts to lose its charm and become as saccharine as a Purple Ronnie postcard.</p> <p>While some ideas are interesting (say, mastering anxiety within 30 minutes), others are clangingly obvious. Does anyone need a book to tell them to be themselves or keep a diary, regardless of its author's good intentions and brave backstory? Espinosa advises changing the way you laugh every two years. At times, I felt like advising him to do something less printable.</p> <p>Apparently, fans get tattoos of their favourite quotations, especially \"Trust your dreams and they will come true\", and send photos to the delighted author. Which is all very sweet, but such lines still don't mean much. You might as well ink your body with the contents of a fortune cookie or bumper sticker.</p> <p>He's passionate about the importance of friendships, such as those formed with his fellow Eggheads. He encourages the reader to seek out their own \"yellows\" \u2013 special people who touch our lives, transform us for the better. We each have 23 \u2013 that number again. Espinosa's fixation with it feels forced and faux-mystical, despite his wide-eyed sincerity.</p> <p>Things get downright irritating when he advises readers actively to seek out these 23 yellows, giving tips on how to spot and approach them. Build a mood-board of faces you're drawn to. Fertile hunting grounds include airports. A key part of bonding is caressing, cuddling and sleeping next to them. Call me an uptight Brit but I'm not going to start loitering in departure lounges, sidling up to strangers and fondling them because they look like a face off my mood-board. I'd get arrested. \"Your honour, I thought she was a yellow\" is unlikely to cut it in court.</p> <p>I found myself wishing Espinosa had written a straightforward memoir, rather than using his experiences as a launch pad for this mystic mumbo-jumbo. His story is fascinating enough, without bolting on all the faux-profound, self-help hokum. Maybe such an approach was too easy for this extraordinary character, but it would've made his book less frustrating and more compelling \u2013 for me, if not for Mr&#xa0;Spielberg.</p>",
  "<p>Freda Black leans forward in her armchair, arches back her shoulders and sings a song about the boy Jesus being given a thrashing by his mother. As an 85-year-old mother-of-nine herself \u2013 now a great-grandmother too \u2013 Freda knows about such things, after living among her people, the Roma, on the road until the age of 30, thereafter in this house, \"like a cage\".</p> <p>The song tells a strange story: about the Christ child asking \"Mary mild\" if he might go out and \"play at ball\". Jesus meets \"three jolly jerkins\" whom he invites to play, but they refuse because \"we are lords' and ladies' sons\", while Christ is \"but some poor maid's child\".</p> <p>Whereupon Jesus \"built a bridge with beams of the sun\", from which the posh children fall and drown. His mother accordingly \"laid our Saviour across her knee / And with a handful of bitter withy / She gave Him lashes three\".</p> <p>The \"bitter withy\" is willow, and for its part in the story, the tree was cursed to \"perish at the heart\" \u2013 rot from within \u2013 as indeed it does. \"It's in the Bible,\" assures Freda. \"I can't read, but I know it's in the Bible.\"</p> <p>\"It isn't in the Bible,\" says a young man sitting on the floor, entranced by the song, \"but what matters is that it's in <em>your</em> Bible, Freda.\" His expression during the performance has been almost as interesting as the song itself \u2013 eyes fixed upon the singer, absorbing every timbre of tone, every intonation, every rhythmic lilt, half-mouthing the words as though singing some silent, inner harmony to himself.</p> <p>Sam Lee is one of Britain's finest singers and the most cogent force of his generation in British folk music; an heir to the great revival during the 1950s and 60s led by Martin Carthy and the Watersons, and Fairport Convention in their wake. Lee brings contemporary folk music back to whence much of it came: Roma, Gypsies and Scottish and Irish Travellers, who have passed these songs from generation to generation, over centuries. He scours Britain for those whom many avoid or despise \u2013 travellers in camps or housed \u2013 to learn their lore and songs. And a first collection makes up his debut album: <em>Ground of Its Own,</em> nominated for a Mercury award last month. When <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/video/2012/oct/26/sam-lee-romany-folk-music-video\" title=\"\">Freda Black</a> talks to him about \"your music\" on the album, he replies: \"Not my music, Freda, it's yours.\"</p> <p>For her part, Freda was born on Christmas Day in Somerset to a Romany mother and father \"who knew everything about a horse\". The family moved to the south-east when Freda was five, to weave baskets, train horses and work as circus performers, among other things. Freda, raising infants in caravans and around campfires, hawked antiques door to door, before being installed under a roof during the 60s as part of a government drive to get travellers off the roads they had navigated for a millennium and more. Many more of her people were housed during the Thatcher administration, when some 65% of sites were crushed. Labour continued the policy, Jack Straw proclaiming open season in 1999 when he said there was \"too much tolerance of travellers\" in Britain. Those who still resist are modern Britain's outcasts, as demonstrated by the violence at Dale Farm last year.</p> <p>Freda married a man from that other ancestry of travellers in Britain, pre-Celts from Ireland and Scotland, so that her nine children are \"mixed\" \u2013 but pure highway. Two of them, Freda Bell and Kathleen, listen now in this front room at Headley, Hampshire.</p> <p>It's hard to gauge who is happiest to be with whom \u2013 Lee with the women or the women with this young man who has sought them out so eagerly. But their trust is not automatic: \"You've worked for this,\" Freda tells Lee. She sings a song called The Pied Straw, to which Lee says: \"You're only the second person in the world I've heard sing that.\" \"Who was the first?\" retorts Freda. \"A farmer in Norfolk called Harry Cox,\" replies Lee. \"You've studied all this, haven't you, Sam?\" \"Maybe too much!\" he laughs.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-398374283\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/25/1351194067833/Freda-Black-and-Sam-Lee-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/11/1/121026SamLeeFolk-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/11/1/121026SamLeeFolk_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/11/1/121026SamLeeFolk_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121026SamLeeFolk/121026SamLeeFolk.m3u8\"/> </video>   <p>Lee was born to a Jewish family of artists in Tufnell Park, north London, from a Polish ancestry of tailors on his father's side. He attended a private school where \"I was miserable, the bullied Jewish kid, because I was uncompromising in my refusal to be interested in what everyone else was interested in. But I saw those pains as something I had to fill.\" There was the Judaism in his family and \"the richness of ritual singing. My father used to call it God-grovelling \u2013 but he'd say, 'Listen through it and enjoy the bits you enjoy.'\u200a\"</p> <p>But schoolboy Lee filled the pain at the antithesis of school: the Forest School Camps to which he went during holidays. These offered \"a kind of Quaker- and Native American-inspired alternative to Scouts \u2013 teaching kids a new way of living; building a community in the wild, breaking the rules of health and safety, turning children into wildwood folk, encouraged to 'sing everything you see'\". There was, he recalls, \"an FSC songbook, a mongrel of 60s pop songs, north-east mining songs, union songs, American folk songs, English drinking songs and murder ballads.\"</p> <p>His path was charted, but not yet found. Lee graduated from art school in Chelsea and secured work dancing in a burlesque West End show near Leicester Square. He would scramble across roofs into the (unlocked) bookshop on the top floor of the Photographers' Gallery, where he would rehearse, unknown to its owners. \"At one point, I took the music director and dancing girls to show them these wonderful books, climbing over the roofs. I suppose that's what I do \u2013 climb into other worlds.\"</p> <p>Lee harboured two great loves: singing and the wild \u2013 as he saw it. \"What is wilderness in this country,\" he ponders, \"where there is no real unspoilt land? I see wilderness in Britain as stinging nettles submerging a disused rubbish tip. Or a Gypsy camp, washing hanging between the caravans. Gypsies and nettles fit into any landscape, and Gypsy folk song is made-up cultural nettles.\"</p> <p>Lee alternated performance nights at the burlesque club with days researching at Cecil Sharp House (the north London headquarters of the <a href=\"http://www.efdss.org/\" title=\"\">English Folk Dance and Song Society</a>), a double life that involved, he recalls, \"sitting under the table backstage, surrounded by dancing girls attaching their nipple tassels, learning songs by old shepherds\".</p> <p>He looked to find his way through a folk world in which, he says, Martin Carthy and the Watersons had \"set the bar\" in terms of performing, and in the wake of whom he felt a \"terrible sense of filtration\" of folk music. \"There was something not quite pure in all this learning from archives. I wanted to go upstream, get to the roots. I discovered Jeannie Robertson, the great Scottish Traveller ballad singer, Harry Cox and the Copper Family \u2013 and I wondered, who <em>are</em> these people? I bought their CDs and was blown away. I thought, I have to learn all these songs.</p> <p>\"There was this difference between songs the Gypsies sang and songs you learned at Cecil Sharp House,\" he says. \"I love the songbooks, but I decided I'd rather throw flames on what tradition is left out there. The Gypsies are our Native Americans: they practise a kind of shamanism mixed with Christianity and the old beliefs.\"</p> <p>The glory of folk music is \"this latency \u2013 the power within to express these things, like the power within everything, trees, plants, the inanimate\". Lee's love of song was inseparable from his love of nature and he felt this in the travellers' songs: \"I'm a tree-climber,\" he says, \"and this music is for me like being up in the branches, knowing you are connected by its roots, deep into the earth.\"</p> <p>Lee's muse appears to be a kind of paganism: \"It's about respect, really, for these gods, whatever and wherever they are, and the land. When you're close to the land, respect it. Know that whatever you do, every plant you pick, will have consequences. I know that even walking through a wood has an impact, which makes me lightfooted.\" Pantheism? Paganism? I ask. \"I'm hesitant to put names to it,\" he replies. \"Just look for this sense of sanctity in the land and find it in song.\"</p> <p>Most of this interview takes place on the terrace of a house that has been in my family for nearly five decades, near to Freda's. Lee and I had arrived late the night before through lashing rain, now blown away by a strong, cold wind in which Lee is happy to sit out in now looking across the downs and at red kites on the wing searching for carrion.</p> <p>There is an otherworldliness about Lee that prepared him for the often spectral adventure that awaited him. \"There I was, working in burlesque razzle-dazzle, wearing hot pants sprayed with glitter,\" he says, unaware then of an imminent meeting that would change his life.</p> <p>Stanley Robertson, who died in 2009, was the nephew of Jeannie Robertson, Scottish Traveller and ballad singer nonpareil. Robertson had taught songs to Martin Carthy, and toured himself. \"I went to hear Stanley sing ballads in Whitby,\" recalls Lee. \"I was so amazed that afterwards I followed him up the cliff steps, opposite the abbey ruins on a stormy night at sea. I caught up with him leaning under an arch of whale bones, clutching the heart that would kill him in the end. I told him it had been wonderful and he answered, 'I know a thooosand ballads.' I trembled, and said, 'I want to learn every one of them.' He didn't know anything about me \u2013 but he got me. He knew I could take this on and learn this canon of songs.\"</p> <p>Robertson suffered a heart attack soon after \"and medically he died. But\" \u2013 Lee talks in deadly earnest \u2013 \"he must have done so in order to revisit his ancestors\". Robertson recovered and lived three more years. He invited Lee to Aberdeen and took him for a walk along the Old Road of Lumphanan, where, according to legend, Macbeth was finally defeated and traditional terrain for Scottish Travellers.</p> <p>\"He did this ceremony,\" says Lee. \"He gave me his ring, and an ingot, a pebble, which I carry around with me, talisman for a keeper of songs. 'You are the custodian,' he said. 'You don't own the songs, you look after them for the next generation.' So this is my life now. I can't go out on Saturday night dancing and having sex. It's my privilege, but yet again, I'm driving up the A90 to Aberdeen to learn songs and back again overnight in time for work.</p> <p>\"So here I am, looking around for Gypsy camps, knocking on doors, asking about songs, and usually people are grateful and amazed that someone cares. I went to see a man once in Weston-super-Mare and after we'd talked about songs for hours, he went to the back of his caravan and handed me a bottle of champagne.\"</p> <p>And so it is that the album up for a Mercury this year is made of songs by a Sussex shepherd called Enos White, or learned from a Surrey horse-dealer called Jasper Smith and, of course, from Stanley Robertson.</p> <p>In the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey this wet summer gone, Lee plays at composer Charles Hazlewood's innovative Orchestra in a Field festival, accompanied by a range of instruments from India and more traditional folk accoutrements. Above all, however, there is this voice.</p> <p>The climax of the afternoon is My Ausheen \u2013 My Old Shoes \u2013 learned from Robertson, on which Lee's tonal range and rhythm stroke the nerves exposed; the singing is sickened at heart, but beautiful. About a man watching his sweetheart wed another, the lyrics have a strangeness of their own: \"How many blackberries grow in the salt sea?/ And I gave my reply with a tear in my eye/ As many ships sail in the forest.\" The instrumentation is potent but eerily restrained; at once authentic and psychedelic. Few listen, for it is early afternoon at the festival, but those who do are spellbound.</p> <p>These include one man who has heard these songs many times before. Joe Boyd is the alchemist of modern English folk, the man who, apart from producing Bob Dylan's first electric set at Newport, discovered and brought forth Fairport Convention, Sandy Denny and Richard Thompson, Syd Barrett, the Incredible String Band, Nick Drake and others.</p> <p>Boyd has become a kind of special adviser to Lee. \"Two things stopped me dead in my tracks when I heard him,\" says Boyd over pasta near his home in Maida Vale, London. \"One is that he's learned something very important about how to sing a song. It's there in the fact he went to Aberdeen to learn \u2013 it marks him out. Sam didn't learn from people who had learned from other people. He broke the chain in what has become a very middle-class, derived way of singing among folk revivalists. If you go around Gypsy camps to learn from the originals, it makes for a totally different way of singing.</p> <p>\"The second important thing, if not the most important, is rhythm. There was a time when most folk revivalists moved away from unaccompanied ballad singing. The Watersons had raised the bar and the way to manage was to play folk music with a guitar, which for most people brought you rhythmically into a ubiquitous kind of mid-Atlantic country-blues thing. To avoid it, you had to play like Martin Carthy or Richard Thompson, who rooted what they did in dance rhythms, but for most it's that plodding guitar, and singing to match.</p> <p>\"Sam has leapt forward and over all that. He sings these rhythms that are abstract, but to the extent they're rooted in anything, they're rooted in the unaccompanied ballad. His voice floats in the way the unaccompanied singers float, rhythmically. Then he brings these wonderful colours to the rhythm.\"</p> <p>But, Boyd adds: \"All this of course is secondary to talent. He has this extraordinary talent, energy, charisma and musicality.\"</p> <p>Back in Hampshire, Freda Black tells another story \"from the Bible\", another curse, this one against her own people, explaining that \"it was Gypsies what stole the nails from the man who made them\" for Christ's crucifixion. Lee adds that, according to lore, Gypsies actually made those nails, thus sentencing their people to be nomads for all time. This story is \"in the Bible, if you read it right,\" insists Freda, \"or some other book.\"</p> <p>The girls, says her daughter Freda Bell, \"taught ourselves to read because we went to school for about a month, then moved on somewhere else\", but the wisdom is passed by word of mouth. The conversation switches to a tale cursing people who refuse charity to those who wander, personified by Jesus: about a woman who refused food to an itinerant and was turned into an owl. The skies are full of strange birds, continues Freda, including \"great eagles that take babies, to kill and eat\".</p> <p>Have you seen them? asks Lee. \"I've seen that,\" Freda replies, \"at Box Hill. About five o'clock. Great birds going to roost \u2013 to take babies and kill them.\" Then she adds, pensively, of her time on the road: \"There was a lot of things about in those days that's not about now.\"</p> <p>Such as \"whiplash snakes\", says Freda Bell, \"that moves in cartwheels\", a mythical creature she had \"seen in the Devil's Punchbowl\" at nearby Hindhead. Kathleen calls it a \"throwing snake \u2013 in the wheatfield, I could swear\".</p> <p>Is it something a Gypsy would see that ordinary folk do not? asks Lee. He tells the women how in Scotland, people tell him they've seen selkies and water sprites \"that the rest of the folks don't see\". \"We never thought about it that way,\" says Freda Bell, \"but we've got an eye for things.\"</p> <p>\"I could talk in Romany, but I don't think you'd believe what I was saying,\" adds her mother. \"We don't talk to other people about what we see.\"</p> <p>Except to Sam Lee, it seems. \"There's things Mum'll tell Sam that she won't tell anyone else!\", notes Frida Bell. And with reason.</p> <p>Lee's affinity to wilderness, and sensitivity to other planes, did not only bring him to these people - it enables him to conjoin what they know. To walk or even drive the lanes with Sam Lee is to take a botanical tour through herbal and fungal lore \u2013 he knows the name of every mushroom, tree and plant, and usually its folkloric meaning or medicinal application.</p> <p>When we take a walk across Frida Bell's field, that her mother might gather herbs and plants from the hedgerow, we get talking medicine. \"We know all about herbs, instead of going to the doctor,\" says Frida Bell. \"Mum would give us Elder bloom, and boil it in a pint bottle. And when that bottle was gone, there'd be no boils or sores, no teenaged spots.\" Both daughters look remarkably young for their age, their beauty preserved. \"We never went to no hospital,\" affirms Kathleen, \"Mum put us out in the field. That's where we learned about animals and birds, and about how they know to survive. It just shows \u2013 if you leave things alone \u2026\"</p> <p>There's talk of what the \"Bread and Cheese Tree\" \u2013 the Hawthorn \u2013 can do: \"Jesus put it wild, for the poor people\". There's plantain leaf for whooping cough, and Sam Lee concurs. He knows and uses the names they use: an apple becomes a \"poddle\"; Lee and Freda discuss the medicinal virtues of a \"Bog Whortle\". Necklaces were made, explains Frida, from dried berries of Deadly Nightshade \"and put around babies necks, under their vests so they couldn't get at 'em \u2013 and not a tear shed from teething\". She adds that \"my mother had eight children in a caravan, and I had some that way myself. Nowadays they go into hospital and makes all that fuss!\"</p> <p>Kathleen says people talk about how hard it was in the old days, \"but it's much harder now\". How so? \"Mentally harder, which is worse than physically hard. The pressure of things. Posh educated people in governments making it impossible to keep head above water.\"</p> <p>\"Putting us in houses,\" adds Freda Bell, \"like birds in cages. The songs were part of our freedom and they still are.\" \"We used to sing on a Sunday while they were making up tents,\" says Kathleen. And, intriguingly: \"Rhodie Black used to sing while we was hop-picking. Everyone would go quiet when this lady sung while we worked\" \u2013 an astonishing Travellers' echo of the holler that begat the blues on the cotton plantations of Mississippi. \"They'd shout: 'Come on Rhodie, strike up a song!'\"</p> <p>The women explain how their ancestors come from India. \"We're not Gypsies, we're Romany,\" explains Freda. \"The Irish Travellers married into our families, but they're a different race,\" adds Kathleen.</p> <p>Most of Freda's songs come, she says, from her father-in-law: \"Best singer I ever heard in my life \u2013 said he was born coming over on a ship from Ireland. My husband would make a fire, we'd gather round and his father would sing.\" Hence this entwinement in travellers' songs between traditional Irish, Scottish and what Lee delights in calling mongrel-English folk. Gypsy songs are usually all and none of these, crossbreed folk music, beloved by Lee. Yet after nightfall, Freda turns to her husband's roots to sing with a power and beauty that send shivers down the spine, a lament not from Somerset, but the land clearances and famine:</p> <p>\"Fare thee well old Ireland, and a sad farewell/ The boat is ready sure I'm leaving you/ But oh my fond heart would sooner bide/ Near Eileen's grave by Lough Sheelin side.\"</p> <p>When she finishes, the company is a little stunned and the room silent but for rain against the window. A melancholy hangs on the air, not from the song, but Kathleen's asking: \"Who's going to remember all this? Kids nowadays \u2013 all they have is Xboxes. My daughter \u2013 she's a lovely voice \u2013 but sings all this modern stuff. We had freedom, but it was safe, and wherever we went, there was always a song to tune up. Who's going to learn all these songs and pass them on?\"</p> <p>The women tell stories about ghosts they've seen, but Lee wants to hear that song again. \"The melody changed,\" he tells Freda, \"from the first to the second verse \u2013 I've never heard that before.\"</p> <p>\"That's me,\" replies Freda.</p> <p>\"I want you to teach that version to me,\" says Lee.</p> <p>Night has darkened and deepened now, rain lashing the scrappy estate and reluctant traveller home, pristine but for our half-eaten fish and chips, cold on the floor. Freda readies herself to sing again and the young man, cross-legged, leans forward, heedfully, unblinking, as though this treasure would vanish for all time were this moment not preserved.</p>",
  "<p>There are some actors' names \u2013 Errol Flynn, Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp \u2013 which, even if they were not famous, would still evoke images of romance, danger, drama. Then there is Bryan Cranston. It's hard to conceive of a more prosaic appellation. It's almost perfectly anonymous. Authentic but dully inconspicuous, it's a background kind of name. A solid name for a solid character actor.</p> <p>Which is what Cranston was for almost three decades. On film and on television, he was repeatedly to be found in supporting roles, slowly building a reputation as a reliable and flexible performer who was equally adept in comedy and drama. Always in employment, he would crop up in shows such as <em>Baywatch</em>, <em>Murder, She Wrote</em>, <em>LA Law</em> and in minor parts in forgotten films such as <em>Amazon Women on the Moon</em> and <em>The Companion</em>.</p> <p>His discreet profile was raised in the mid-90s by a recurring stint on <em>Seinfeld</em>, in which he played \"dentist to the stars\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLKbXuv-xA\" title=\"\">Dr Tim Whatley</a>. That led to improved supporting roles in better films and to the part as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_8OpmaZnc0\" title=\"\">bungling father</a> in the popular family sitcom <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>. Despite the upturn in his career, attention and awards remained centred on his fellow actors in the show. While his face \u2013 a curious mixture of a weak mouth and resilient eyes \u2013 became much better known, even fans of the show would have struggled to put a name to it.</p> <p>What turned Bryan Cranston into a name that people began to remember, that producers sought to sign and that other actors spoke of with hard-earned respect was the part of Walter White, the mild-mannered chemistry teacher who turns to manufacturing crystal meth in the cable TV hit <em>Breaking Bad</em>. It was that rare gig in acting: a character lead, a part that not only called for detail and depth but which also propelled the action. The first series was screened in America in 2008 and Cranston won the Emmy award for outstanding lead actor in a drama series. He repeated the feat the following year and the year after that. Finally, after 30 years in the business, Cranston was an overnight star.</p> <p>I met him earlier this month in London, where he was promoting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/07/argo-ben-affleck-review\" title=\"\"><em>Argo</em></a>, a film directed by Ben Affleck that's based on the real-life story of six American embassy workers who were rescued from Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis. It's a slick and entertaining thriller in which Cranston plays the part of Jack O'Donnell, a wily CIA agent who oversees the \"exfiltration\".</p> <p>It's not the main part \u2013 that's taken by Affleck \u2013 but it is the kind of role, like his equally deft performance in last year's <em>Drive</em>, that wouldn't have come Cranston's way a few years ago. He knows exactly why the quality of job offers has improved in recent years. \"<em>Breaking Bad</em> has certainly raised the bar,\" he says. \"There's been an effect on my career, there's no question about that. I can't just accept anything that comes along. It has to be at a level that's different but matches the level of writing of<em> Breaking Bad</em>. It takes a tremendous amount of work because you read massive amounts of product in order to find the nugget of gold. And the nugget of gold in this case is <em>Argo</em>, which is extremely well written.\"</p> <p>He praises Affleck's skill as a film-maker and his ability to maintain focus as an actor while dealing with all the other responsibilities a director has to field. Perhaps sensitive to the criticism from some quarters that the film is an exercise in pro-American propaganda, Cranston is quick to make an unsolicited statement clarifying his and the film's liberal sentiments. \"What I appreciate about the movie is that the film-makers decided to come clean by announcing the culpability of America in our foreign policy, that we helped to orchestrate the regime change in Iran putting the Shah in power. The bad guy in the movie is really an ideology. Any kind of civil rights oppression is wrong.\"</p> <p>Mini-lecture over, he returns to the question of the <em>Breaking Bad</em> effect. \"As it's a well-told story,\" he explains, \"it attracts attention from storytellers themselves, because it's so intricate and dark and twisted.\"</p> <p>It's also the story of a man whose brilliantly creative mind has been imprisoned in mediocrity, a man who has silently acquired a lifetime's pent-up frustrations. What liberates Walter White is a diagnosis of terminal cancer. Knowing that he is soon to die, he begins to live, by using his chemical expertise to produce the purest and most potent methamphetamine the market has ever seen.</p> <p>Given the powerful conviction and credibility that Cranston brings to White's metamorphosis, it's tempting to see White's buried resentments as a metaphor for the disappointments of his own career. However it's not a temptation to which Cranston is given, at least not publicly.</p> <p>\"No,\" he insists, \"I was very happy with my career. If you have a level of expectation in your life that you have to be a quote-unquote star, whatever that means, you might be setting yourself up for failure. But my expectations were that I would be a working actor, that I could honestly say that I make a living as an actor and that was achieved when I was 24. Above that, the world doesn't owe me anything, the business doesn't owe me anything. Anything that is gained is through hard work.\"</p> <p>All of that may be true, but you only have to spend half an hour in Los Angeles to sense the atmosphere of envy and insecurity that hangs over the city like its smog. Everyone knows exactly how well everyone else is doing and no one is doing well enough. To maintain an attitude of professional contentment as a middle-ranking character actor would be an act of Zen-like forbearance, particular if you harboured ambitions, like the rest of LA's inhabitants, to be something more.</p> <p>He gives a glimpse of the inner drive that must have taken him through all those walk-on parts in the 1980s and 1990s when he says: \"In order to be an actor you really have to be one of those types of people who are risk-takers and have what is considered an actor's arrogance, which is not to say an arrogance in your personal life. But you have to be the type of person who wants the ball with seconds left in the game. The masses don't want the ball. They don't want to be responsible for not making the shot. Actors need to want that chance. Give me that chance.\"</p> <p>And that chance, as he is keen to make clear, is often a matter of chance. \"Luck is a component that a lot of people in the arts sometimes fail to recognise: that you can have talent, perseverance, patience, but without luck you will not have a successful career.\"</p> <p>Cranston's luck was to be cast as an antisemitic lunatic, terrorised by sound waves, in an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIj0yyvCww8\" title=\"\">episode</a> of the paranormal drama series <em>The</em> <em>X-Files</em>. The episode began with Cranston's character driving wildly into the desert. Broadcast in 1998, it was written by Vince Gilligan. Almost 10 years later, Gilligan recalled Cranston and asked him to take the lead in a drama he had conceived about a middle-aged man whose end-life crisis thrusts him into the darklands of America's illicit drug trade. The opening scene saw Cranston once more driving wildly into the desert.</p> <p>Since that moment, the drama has steadily and sometimes abruptly developed across five series \u2013 the fifth and final season is now showing in the States \u2013 into an intimate and fascinating study of character, motivation and moral choice. The first two series were broadcast on the FX channel in Britain but since then viewers have either downloaded the show \u2013 legally and illegally \u2013 or caught up with it through renting or buying series DVD sets.</p> <p>However it has been viewed, the series now demands to be spoken of in the same breathless breath as those other mammoth American dramas <em>The Sopranos</em> and <em>The Wire</em>. Although <em>Breaking Bad</em> can't rival the narrative breadth and complexity of those two television landmarks, and it has also taken more artistic licence with its plots, it does match them in terms of originality, intelligence, sense of place and dramatic engagement and certainly outdoes both in cinematography.</p> <p>When filming began, Cranston had little idea of the particulars of his character's travails, only a general sense of his moral trajectory. \"I knew Vince wanted to go from Mr Chips to Scarface,\" he says. \"I knew he wanted to go from a good person to a bad person. So it was up to me to figure out, through his writing, how to make it feel plausible and justifiable. Some people are saying recently, about some of the things he's done: that's not Walt. I say: it is now. He's a very pragmatic man, very scholarly, very exact. Chemistry is an exact science. No guesswork. But now because his emotions are gone, he's doing things that are a little erratic. He's impulsive at times.\"</p> <p>If some viewers have expressed doubts about Walt's evolution or, perhaps more accurately, devolution, plenty of others see it as an epic voyage into the American underbelly. No less an authority on storytelling than Stephen King even suggested that <em>Breaking Bad</em> had \"surpassed <em>The Sopranos</em>\". Describing the series as an \"American classic\", King said that Cranston and his co-star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/13/aaron-paul-breaking-bad-interview\" title=\"\">Aaron Paul</a> had \"turned in the best performances I've seen in years\".</p> <p>What's beyond doubt is that the relationship between Walter White and his former pupil and troublesome sidekick, Jesse Pinkman (Paul) is one of the great unlikely double acts of television or film, an odd couple to beat <em>The Odd Couple</em>. Squeezed into their prickly partnership are themes of youth and age, rectitude and dysfunction, love and hate, loyalty and mistrust. And the whole dynamic is balanced on a knife edge, forever teetering between black comedy and even blacker tragedy.</p> <p>Cranston speaks of Paul with obvious paternal-like affection. \"I love his parents \u2013 I know them pretty well \u2013 but he could be my son almost. I'm old enough to have fathered him and I do have fatherly feelings towards him. Occasionally I give him advice and just try to guide him to where he needs to be, at least from my point of view.\"</p> <p>In <em>The Odd Couple</em> it was Jack Lemmon who played the role of the fastidious flatmate. And it was to Lemmon that Jane Kaczmarek (Cranston's co-star in <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>) has compared her one-time screen husband. \"He's like Jack Lemmon,\" she said three years ago, \"except now he's doing <em>Days of Wine and Roses</em> or <em>The Apartment</em>.\"</p> <p>Lemmon, it turns out, is one of Cranston's acting heroes. \"I appreciated his intensity, his zest for it. He would say: it's magic time. I have the same attitude \u2013 it's a fun adventure for me. And for Jack to go from comedy to drama so fluidly \u2013 I wish I'd had the opportunity to meet him.</p> <p>\"Dick Van Dyke influenced me a lot \u2013 you know, his physical comedy and his ability to be loose in his body. Rod Steiger was another actor I thought was immensely talented. Mark Rylance is someone I have a huge man-crush on. If I could watch him just drink tea I'd sit there for an hour.\"</p> <p>In person, there's little that's coy or comic about Cranston. He comes across as amiable but almost coolly professional and much more physically confident than he tends to appear on screen. If you look closely at his performances, there are flashes of Van Dyke in his chaotic father in <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>, but there is something consistently Lemmon-like about his overall work as actor. It's a sort of contorted or neurotic decency that can play for laughs or tears, a perplexed, put-upon pathos that you root for in spite of everything. And in <em>Breaking Bad</em> there is an awful lot of everything.</p> <p>Taken together, it amounts to a serious challenge to the viewer's sympathies, let alone those of commissioning executives. Although American cable TV has proved itself to be remarkably open to difficult subject matter, the idea of a middle-aged, middle-class, middle-American peddling crystal meth is not what you'd call an easy sell. All the major cable networks turned it down, and although the series was developed at FX, it too passed.</p> <p>AMC, its eventual home, embraced the concept but had reservations about Cranston. Nonetheless Gilligan knew that he was vital to the show. \"Because he's so decent and likable,\" Gilligan has said, \"Bryan allows you to comprehend why he does what he does, even if you don't agree with it.\"</p> <p>Along with its setting beneath the magnificent wide-open skies of Albuquerque in New Mexico, one of the most distinctive aspects of <em>Breaking Bad</em> is the crystal meth scene. In common with Cranston, it's resolutely unglamorous. There are no sexy fringe benefits, no alluring distractions. It's either the cold science and ruthless business of the producers or the violent highs and grimy dissipation of the consumers. Although the war on drugs is depicted with all the futile death and destruction that wars wreak, it would be difficult to describe the show's message as explicitly, or even implicitly, anti-prohibitionist.</p> <p>Cranston isn't interested in getting into the politics of the situation. For him, the role of crystal meth in the series was fundamentally dramatic. \"If it was marijuana we were dealing with, no one really cares,\" he says. \"But the fact that it's this very heavy scourge-of-society type drug means there is far more at stake. It also makes it much more difficult for Walter to be able to compromise his ethics.\"</p> <p>When pressed on his views on drugs, he takes a classically liberal libertarian stance. \"I think marijuana should be legalised,\" he says. \"There should still be restrictions on being intoxicated, and there should be age limits and so on, but I think it should be legalised. I also think prostitution should be legalised. What two adults do in private shouldn't be any of my business, and in a pragmatic way you'd save millions upon millions of dollars not incarcerating these young women.\"</p> <p>Cranston has been married for 23 years to the actress Robin Dearden. They met on a TV show called <em>Airwolf</em>. He played a kidnapper and she was his hostage. \"We still love each other. She's with me now and we like to travel together,\" he says a little defensively about Dearden when I ask about his&#xa0;five-year screen relationship with Anna Gunn, who plays Walt's wife, Skyler, in <em>Breaking&#xa0;Bad</em>. He and Dearden have a teenage daughter and he divides his time between Los Angeles and Albuquerque, where for the past five years he has spent six months out of every 12&#xa0;filming.</p> <p>He grew up in the San Fernando Valley, the vast suburb that lies beyond the Hollywood Hills. His parents were both actors. \"They met in Hollywood in an acting class in 1948, after the war when everything was new and fresh and alive and full of potential and possibility. It must have been a very romantic time. And they had their romance.\"</p> <p>His mother stopped acting to raise a family \u2013 \"I think she resented the fact that she gave up that part of her life\" \u2013 and his father was often out of work. Perhaps aware of Hollywood's vicissitudes, Cranston decided to join the police. He joined a police explorer group when he was 16 and graduated first out of 111 cadets. \"I think I would have been a good policeman. They have to have a curious mind and a sceptical view, to not just believe everything they see but uncover every single element and be detail-orientated, to know protocol and keep a cool head under fire. And I think that's something I could have done.\"</p> <p>The reason he didn't, he says, is because he discovered girls.</p> <p>\"I was also taking an elective theatre class at college and the girls in theatre class were far prettier than the ones in police science class. In my job as a young actor I was supposed to kiss this girl. That was my job. I've been trying to do this all my life and now you're telling me I'm <em>supposed</em> to do this? I love this. It's like you stepped into a fantasy. So at 19 years old this was the basis of my decision-making. No more police work, I'm going to be an actor.\"</p> <p>Almost 40 years later, few would argue that he made the wrong decision. He may well have made a fine detective but in Walter White, the chemistry teacher with lung cancer, he has created one of the most memorable villains ever to don a black hat.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2012. The original misspelled Robin Dearden's name as Robin Deardon throughout. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>One of the first times that Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen took her seat in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, the lower house of the French parliament, she was stopped by a male politician. \"He looked at me and said: 'And whose secretary are you?'\" says Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen.</p> <p>In June, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen became the youngest MP in modern French history, at the age of 22, after topping the poll in her constituency of Carpentras in the south-eastern region of the Vaucluse, with 49.09% of the vote. And yet the most disconcerting thing about her victory was arguably not her youth but her politics: Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is an MP for the Front National and the newest face of the French far right. Her grandfather, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/jean-marie-le-pen\" title=\"\">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>, founded the political party which she now represents, a party which is anti-Europe, anti-globalisation and which believes in stringent immigration controls and national protectionism.</p> <p>\"Integration is no longer possible,\" she says. \"When you're the single French person in the middle of 10 Tunisians, the majority will impose their way of life on the minority.\"</p> <p>Blonde, slim and striking, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen talks in a fluent and engaging manner. When we meet in her small, airless office in the headquarters of the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale in Paris, her hair is swept back in a ponytail, her clothes are fashionable but discreet: a black top with zip detailing at the shoulders, tailored beige trousers, boots with a sensible heel. In a building filled with middle-aged men in grey suits, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen stands out.</p> <p>The fact is that she looks like a 22-year-old \u2013 albeit one in possession of an extraordinary degree of focus and ambition \u2013 and it is perhaps this that makes it difficult to believe she espouses some of the hardline views that form part of her personal and political heritage. She says she is used to people underestimating her.</p> <p>\"It happens,\" she shrugs. \"People have said I'm a puppet, an instrument of my grandfather but I think they quickly realised that I'm my own person, that I have autonomy in my actions. I think they rapidly realised I could look after myself.\"</p> <p>And yet however much she might try and distance herself from it, the Front National's grubby history casts a long shadow. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen was born in 1989, two years after her grandfather claimed in an interview that the Nazi gas chambers were \"a point of detail of the second world war\" and six months before Front National supporters were accused of desecrating a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras, the town that would later become her constituency.</p> <p>She grew up surrounded by far-right politics in a red-brick manor house called the Pavillon de l'\u00c9cuyer in the western Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud that is home to several generations of Le Pens. Behind the rows of oak trees and conifers which shield it from public view, the house continues to play host to the entire dynasty: Jean-Marie, the 84-year-old elder statesman, presides over events and has his office on the first floor. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/marine-le-pen\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen</a>, the youngest of his three daughters, who succeeded him as party leader last year, lives above a former stable in the extensive grounds. Marion lives with her mother, Yann, Jean-Marie's middle daughter, on the second floor of the main house. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's divorced parents are both heavily involved in the Front National: her mother organises the party's rallies and her father, Samuel Mar\u00e9chal, used to lead its youth movement.</p> <p>It is partly as a result of this curious setup that many have accused Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen of being little more than a photogenic figurehead for a party seeking to ditch its thuggish past in search of more mainstream credibility. There are those who question whether she genuinely believes the policies she's pitching to the wider public.</p> <p>\"She speaks rather well,\" says the French cultural commentator Agn\u00e8s Poirier, \"but a little like a law student who has memorised her dissertation.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427507\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/26/1351254712427/Marion-Mar-chal-Le-Pen-004.jpg\" alt=\"Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, France\u2019s youngest MP, and the latest in the family dynasty.

Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's aunt, Marine, has been instrumental in dragging the image of the Front National into the modern era, moving away from racist rhetoric, reaffirming secularism and insisting that France should stand on its own two feet and leave the euro. In April 2011, Marine banned regional councillor Alexandre Gabriac from the party after a photograph of him giving the Nazi salute was leaked to the press, calling his behaviour \"intolerable\". In return, she has been rewarded with electoral success: the Front National is now the third largest party in France. When Marine stood as a candidate in the presidential elections earlier this year, she electrified the race by polling 17.9% in the first round \u2013 more than 6m votes \u2013 eventually finishing third behind Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. But it has not all been plain sailing: although her niece was elected to parliament in June, Marine Le Pen lost her bid to win a seat by 118 votes.</p> <p>The party's parliamentary hopes now rest on Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, who is seen as an astute, media-friendly young woman capable of mobilising widespread support and reinvigorating the immigration debate. But there are those who question her own commitment, believing that she is little more than her grandfather's mouthpiece.</p> <p>According to Matthew Fraser, a professor at the American University of Paris: \"The old man [Jean-Marie] is grudgingly fading away \u2013 and it is grudging, there is talk that he misses the spotlight. He's hardly in retirement. For now, the granddaughter is an attractive and young symbol \u2013 probably not a real power in the system.\"</p> <p>I ask Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen if she discusses political strategy with her elders around the dining table in the family mansion. \"No, not at all,\" she replies. \"We are all able to have our private lives. We're lucky to have such a close family, with my grandfather and cousins around us. We're very blessed. I think because we've always been confronted by adversity from the outside so we've become closer because of that, because we've had to be a strong unit to withstand those blows.\"</p> <p>She says she first developed an interest in politics at the age of 16 and supported Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential elections. But she soon became disenchanted by him and, at the age of 19, started to help out with campaigning for the Front National and volunteered for the youth wing of the party. She combined standing as an MP with her postgraduate studies in public law and is still a student at Panth\u00e9on-Assas University, a traditionally rightwing institution. Her grandfather, a former paratrooper who also went on to study law, was himself once the youngest MP in French politics when he was elected in 1956 at the age of 28. Is he proud of her carrying on the family tradition?</p> <p>\"I think so,\" she says. \"I hope so. He is proud of those who seek to take back their heritage and is passionate about France and he's happy that young people are becoming engaged [Marion's electoral success was due in part to her popularity among voters aged 18-25]. I don't agree with everything he says, but I agree with the essential spirit and of that he's proud. What he hates most of all is inertia, people who are spectators.\"</p> <p>What, then, are her policies? She lists them, one by one, in rapid-fire \u2013 at one point, she is speaking so quickly that her adviser, Arnaud, has to remind her to slow down as French is not my first language.</p> <p>\"But dammit, I am speaking slowly!\" she protests and then carries on at the same breakneck pace. On the economy, she wants France to abandon the euro and readopt the franc. She wants tighter regulation for financial institutions in the wake of the banking crisis and lower taxes for French businesses in order to regain consumer confidence. She is vehemently anti-EU \u2013 a position that has found favour with republican French voters who believe the integrity of their nation is endangered by federal government. And she claims that the Front National has taken a truly \"feminist\" stance on maternity leave by devising a policy that would give stay-at-home parents a salary. Although, when I ask if she considers herself a feminist, she replies: \"No, not especially. I'm not obsessed with the rights of women, it can be a bit excessive. I want to put men and women on an equal footing. I think we are equal, but different.\" She is against positive discrimination or quota systems, believing that women should be treated on their own merits.</p> <p>\"Then, of course, we have our policies on immigration,\" she continues. \"More and more communities are asking for the introduction of their specific religious law and that is a threat to secularisation. It's particularly an issue among Muslim communities. Not all Muslims,\" she clarifies, hastily. \"Most Muslims in France are not fundamentalists. What is surprising is that the first generation of immigrants were very well assimilated. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/10/france-burqa-law-kenza-drider\" title=\"They didn't wear the veil in public.\">They didn't wear the veil in public.</a> They kept their religion in the private sphere. Now whole immigrant communities are being created \u2013 because of past government policies \u2013 that are separate.\"</p> <p>In France, where the divorce of church from state underpinned the French revolution, secularisation is viewed as a basic tenet of the country's progressive thought. Since April 2011, women have been banned from wearing the burqa or the niqab in public. In this context, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's comments are not especially controversial. But then she goes even further, outlining a plan to strip second-generation immigrants of citizenship if they commit a crime&#xa0;or refuse to learn French.</p> <p>\"Today, if someone is born in France, they automatically have French nationality even if they have made no effort to integrate,\" she says. \"We believe that French people should be prioritised for social housing and employment opportunities, if they have an equal competence.\"</p> <p>But what about the \"genuine\" French? If they commit a crime, will they too be stripped of their nationality?</p> <p>\"No. We're talking about people to whom we've done a favour,\" Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen leans forward, elbows on her knees, legs apart. She maintains eye contact and talks with a kind of easy charm that could, in the right circumstances, be quite hypnotising. \"We've given them a certain number of privileges and if they haven't shown themselves to be worthy of French citizenship, then it's normal to take it back.\"</p> <p>This is all so smoothly expressed, that it takes a moment for the impact of it to hit home: that the law, under the Front National, would mean one thing for those descended from immigrants and another thing entirely for what Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen views as the \"true\" French race.</p> <p>Isn't her stance racist? \"That accusation is largely used by our opponents to discredit us. I don't see how it's racist to prioritise French nationals. We're not talking about black or white. It's normal that French people who pay taxes should be prioritised, just as an Algerian who is naturalised will have priority [in social housing and employment].\"</p> <p>She points out that people from Martinique, for example, would not be subject to the proposed nationality restrictions because the Caribbean island is an officially designated region of France and goes on to name a number of Front National members from ethnic minority backgrounds, including Charlotte Soula, the office manager of Marine Le Pen who is of Algerian origin (and a convert from Islam to Catholicism).</p> <p>\"The racism argument is a very violent one but it works less and less,\" says Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen. \"Now, on the ground, people don't think it any more of us. They understand it's a political tactic. Most people think we're right.</p> <p>\"It's a debate that stirs up emotions, of course it is. It's hard to talk about it because of the human dimension that affects people. We are not monsters. I have empathy, I am humane, I understand human misery. My grandfather always said: 'Don't be angry at the immigrants, be angry at the political class that created this situation.' I've nothing against people who come to France in search of a better life. If France had the means to welcome everyone, we would. We have that history [of tolerance]. But we don't have the means. We are in debt. Our welfare system is melting under the pressure. We have a colossal deficit. It's sad but we have to have the political courage to say 'stop'. And it's sad because, when we say 'stop', we are saying it to a man or a woman, but there we go.\"</p> <p>Immigration, she concedes, \"has also been good\" for France. The problem, as she sees it, is that past government policies have failed, causing resentment among those who believe their country is being overrun by \"outsiders\". She goes on to claim that a number of Muslim women, who feel pressurised into wearing the veil within their communities, are also supportive of her position.</p> <p>\"There are women who say to me, 'I can't wear a skirt,' or 'I'll be insulted if I don't wear a veil or don't go to the mosque.' There's a pressure within the community imposed by others. Those people, more and more, are calling on us to act because we are the only ones who see secularism as fundamentally important.\"</p> <p>Is the Front National becoming a political force to be reckoned with in France? The election of Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen in June, alongside fellow party candidate Gilbert Collard, gave the party a foothold in parliament for the first time since the mid-1980s, but the first-past-the-post electoral system is still weighted against smaller parties. As a result, the popularity of the Front National \u2013 especially in impoverished, semi-urbanised rural areas where unemployment is high \u2013 might be far more ingrained than the electoral results suggest.</p> <p>As Hugh Schofield, a BBC news correspondent based in Paris, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17824436\" title=\"\">wrote in an article last April</a>: \"In this semi-urbanised countryside, people feel the hopelessness of a life in poverty uncompensated-for by the traditions and structures that would have made it bearable in the past.</p> <p>\"Shops are now in vast out-of-town zones; no one goes to church; work is a 50km drive away. And the cost of the two staples \u2013 cigarettes and petrol \u2013 has just shot through the roof.</p> <p>\"For these people, a Front National vote offers both a protest (against the wealthy; against the EU; against the establishment), but also a claim: for an identity and the right to a traditional 'French' way of life.\"</p> <p>In urban areas, too, there are fears about mass immigration \u2013 fears that were heightened by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_civil_unrest_in_France\" title=\"\">2005 riots</a> by mostly French youths of north African origin from the suburbs of Paris and other major cities. The riots highlighted chronic tensions caused by immigration and unemployment and the mainstream parties began to adopt the rhetoric of the Front National. Sarkozy, who was interior minister at the time, referred to the rioters as <em>racaille</em> or scum \u2013 a term viewed by some as having implicitly racist connotations.</p> <p>\"Sarkozy won in 2007 by shifting to the right and stealing FN votes,\" explains Matthew Fraser. \"In that sense, [Jean-Marie] Le Pen was ahead of his time \u2013 whether his views are despicable or not is a moral question, but what is certain is that they are electorally popular. And his adversaries understand this. Hence the paradox: they pretend the FN is ideologically unfrequentable, yet they steal the party's discourse and platforms to get elected. It's rather like borrowing someone's house to throw a party, but not inviting the owner.\"</p> <p>France has a long history with the far right which has traditionally been allied with the Catholic church (even the former president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was, as a young man, involved in conservative nationalist movements) and Marine Le Pen's attempts to decontaminate the image of the FN have not been without success. \"Today, the reality is that the extreme right is against us,\" she claimed in an interview for <em>The Nation</em> last year. \"The National Front has evolved.\"</p> <p>Despite a recent groundswell of support in provincial France, however, the party is still viewed with outright distaste among the Parisian chattering classes.</p> <p>\"In France it is acceptable, even fashionable, to espouse far-left political convictions, but absolutely unacceptable to belong to the far right,\" says Fraser. \"The explanation is largely historical. France has been living with the shame of the Nazi collaboration under the Vichy regime, after which the far right was marginalised from what are considered to be acceptable political values in France.\"</p> <p>And there are those who caution against believing that a leopard can change its spots. Alain Jakubowicz, the president of <a href=\"http://www.licra.org/\" title=\"\">Licra</a>, the international league against racism and antisemitism, puts it this way: \"Today, the party is represented by a young woman with a modern and normal appearance [but] the FN remains the same, with its xenophobic, racist and antisemitic DNA.\"</p> <p>Back in her office, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen insists that the Front National's transformation is not simply a superficial public relations exercise.</p> <p>\"Of course the party has evolved,\" she says. \"The problems are no longer the same, so evolution has happened naturally\u2026 When the Front National was created in the 1970s it was against the background of communism and the cold war. It was a real threat, now it's no longer the case\u2026 Now our main hobby-horse is anti-globalisation.\"</p> <p>She insists that she has only ever encountered \"a positive reaction\" on the street. \"Even people who don't share my politics, they say: 'I'm not Front National but I'm happy you're there because it creates debate.'\"</p> <p>Arnaud, her adviser, helpfully interrupts at this point to remind her that she recently went to a fashionable Parisian restaurant and was given a spontaneous round of applause by the diners. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen looks embarrassed.</p> <p>\"The owner was very kind and he took me around and said: 'Tonight we're welcoming Mademoiselle Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen,' and everyone clapped,\" she says hurriedly. \"It was really kind.\"</p> <p>Does she ever receive hate mail?</p> <p>\"I've had one letter.\"</p> <p>Arnaud interjects. \"But if I get out all the ones that say how marvellous you are, how beautiful, there's no comparison,\" he gushes.</p> <p>It seems incredible that she has only ever had one piece of negative mail. I tell her that in the UK, journalists get more than that in any given week.</p> <p>\"The most aggressive people are other MPs,\" she says. \"Some of them are very aggressive, even though we've all been democratically elected.\" Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, the leader of the centre-right UMP party, has in the past refused to shake her hand. \"He might refuse to shake my hand, but his electors will gladly do so,\" is her response. Spoken like a true politician.</p> <p>I can see why Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is electable. In person, she has an engaging, accessible manner. There is the occasional glimpse of humour \u2013 when we are talking about her party's maternity leave policies, the subject of children comes up. Does she want a family? She guffaws. \"Yes, if I can find a suitable sperm donor.\"</p> <p>At the same time, I find her charisma unsettling because it is being deployed in the defence of some dubious beliefs. As the interview draws to a close, I tell her I have one final question and it's a personal one. She nods, encouraging me to go on.</p> <p>I am married to a man whose father came to the UK from Sudan, I say. If he lived in France under a Front National government, my husband would therefore fall into that category of second-generation immigrants who would have to prove deserving of a citizenship automatically conferred on others. Given this, I wonder what her position is on marriages between people from different backgrounds?</p> <p>Maybe it's because I'm expecting a reaction that I think I see a slight flinch in her face. It is a tiny movement: the expression of someone who has effectively masked their surprise.</p> <p>\"I'm not against it,\" she replies. \"For me, marriage is a very personal choice. The only thing&#xa0;I'd say is that I know, from people who've told me firsthand, that sadly mixed marriages can be a bit conflicted on everyday issues. For instance, the naming of children \u2013 Muslims need children to take Muslim names, often they want women to convert to Islam. The other surprising thing is that often, in a divorce, north African fathers take their children back to their country and the mother never sees them again. That causes problems. I don't judge, but it can cause conflict.\"</p> <p>And yet she has judged, making a series of sweeping assumptions on the basis of very little actual knowledge about a particular set of personal circumstances. Perhaps Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is right that immigration needs to be discussed and that MPs are wary of doing so in case they are accused of racism. Some of her opinions have the sheen of plausibility. She is not unlikable. But the tone of her last answer suggests a more disturbing set of beliefs at play beneath the surface: a whiff of something rotten at the core of her politics and a sense that the world is made up of people who can be divided easily into \"us\" or \"them\".</p> <p><strong>A family business: the Le Pen dynasty</strong></p> <h2><strong>Jean-Marie Le Pen</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427508\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/26/1351256209846/Jean-Marie-Le-Pen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Marie Le Pen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Chamussy/Sipa/Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chamussy/Sipa/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1928 </strong>Born 20 June in Brittany, the son of a fisherman.</p> <p><strong>1972</strong> Le Pen co-founds the Front National and presides over it for nearly 40 years.</p> <p><strong>1984</strong> Becomes an MEP.</p> <p><strong>1987</strong> Is found guilty of violating French law and fined 1.2m francs (\u00a3150,000) for remarks concerning the presence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps.

  "<p>The new way of generating hype on the internet is to pretend that a band comes from the stone age.

It was nonsense, of course \u2013 a couple of Googles and you're reading lead singer Lauren Mayberry's <a href=\"http://www.rehis.com/sites/default/files/REHIS%20Journal%2022-4%20Winter%20(web%20version).pdf\" title=\"\">winning entry</a> for the Royal Environmental Health Institute for Scotland Journalism Award in 2010, a lively essay on the hygiene of body piercing. Or watching Martin Doherty playing synths with Scottish indie rockers <a href=\"http://www.thetwilightsad.com/\" title=\"\">the Twilight Sad</a> \u2013 or Iain Cook playing synths with his previous band <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/aereogrammeofficial\" title=\"\">Aereogramme</a>.</p> <p>But there will always be mystery in that one-in-a-million pop song that gets you straight in the neck. Chvrches' <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxxUEzOvU-Y\" title=\"\">The Mother We Share</a> (released as a single on <a href=\"http://www.national-anthem.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Anthem</a> in November) is a warm electropop wonder with the kind of tune Barry Gibb would've woken in the night to scribble down, and a lyric so touching and humane you want to take its birdlike but formidable singer out and buy her a hot chocolate. Over the Gary Numan-style synths and slick sound collage, Mayberry's high voice rings out with a rare untrained quality \u2013 that's why she sounds so Scottish, she explains, but naturally, \"not like the Proclaimers\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F60173536&amp;show_artwork=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F60173536&show_artwork=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\"It's a question that keeps me awake at night,\" volunteers Doherty, a humble chap in a baseball cap at an 85-degree incline. \"Do people only have a certain number of good songs in them? Do you write them all in the first year and then you have none left? I struggle with that!\" There's a cautious glance from Cook. The most annoying thing about this \"only two songs on YouTube\" hype, he explains, is that people assume you haven't got anything else. Chvrches only formed a year ago (the boys have known each other since 2004) but they insist they've already got tons of songs \u2013 just that they're not signed, so there's nowhere to put them.</p> <p>When you ask a band how their songs are written, they generally say they <em>just happen</em> when they sit in a room and <em>throw ideas around</em> and <em>find what works</em>, etc. Not that they use a \"collaborative Google spreadsheet\" to lay all their melodic contributions alongside one another, then trace the shape of a song emerging \u2013 or that lyrics are chosen for their proximity to an improvised set of nonsense vowel sounds. Chvrches' pop factory, rather like that of the other boy/ boy/ girl electro-trio <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/the-xx\" title=\"\">the xx</a>, seems both organic and scientific. And <em>collaborative</em>: nothing bothers Mayberry more than the assumption \u2013 which hasn't really been made yet, but she predicts it will \u2013 that the two blokes write the music and she sings it. \"Even in the early stages, you can tell who thinks you're an idiot singing songs someone else has written for you,\" she says. \"We never wanted to be two producers and a girl who wears some shoes. I'm not going to get on a soapbox and start banging on about vaginas but I'd hope that people are listening to the music.\"</p> <p>The image thing troubles her. When you've recently completed a master's dissertation on images of femininity in women's magazines (\"I spent a lot of time reading <em>Cosmopolitan</em> and quietly crying,\") you're wise to photographers putting the focus on you and turning the rest of the band into fuzzy shapes in the background \u2013 she tries to stop them doing it, sometimes. If only Mayberry didn't look like she does \u2013 beautiful, startled and startling all at once \u2013 the path of life would be smoother.</p> <p>Chvrches (they put the \"v\" in their name because they were \"tired of competing with Jesus for internet hits\") have already learned a lot about the industry by watching from the wings, and are fantastically analytical. Their hero Prince (they play his song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsOsLlihVrk\" title=\"\">I Would Die 4 U</a> in live shows) has \"no quality control\" but they admire the way the purple icon was never \"a perfectly packaged pop thing \u2013 he was messy. We are trying to keep things rougher too,\" explains Doherty. \"Instead of quantising everything in a 'dance' way, we want to keep it rough, like demos.\"</p> <p>Which is easy to do, until they've got a contract and a full-length record to make. \"Albums are pretty much a marketing tool to get people to your shows now,\" says Martin, \"but until we're signed it's like we are not a legitimate recording act.\" In the meantime, he admits to being \"plagued\" by melodies, while Mayberry works on her diaphragm to cope with the demands of their November tour.</p> <p>One thing's for certain. You know you've made it when your parents aren't averse to the idea of you pursuing your music. \"That was the first time I thought, maybe this band is going somewhere,\" says Doherty. \"When my mum heard a song and said: 'That's all right.' She seemed surprised.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is 16 October 1979. Manchester quartet Joy Division have just played a show in Brussels and are a few days away from recording <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQSpJfpVHmg\" title=\"Atmosphere\">Atmosphere</a>, the sepulchral masterpiece that will take on uncanny weight seven months later, when the body of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis is found hanging in his kitchen. On this particular night, however, Curtis is urinating in an ashtray in his bandmates' youth hostel room. \"Ha, you wankers, I'm pissing in your room,\" says this tortured poet, this future icon of doomed youth. \"Ha ha, pissing in your room!\"</p> <p>This anecdote is typical of bass guitarist Peter Hook's conflicted account of his first band's cruelly abbreviated existence. The Joy Division story often appears misleadingly neat in the telling: two near-perfect albums of unusual grace and gravity, a handful of other songs, some memorable, occasionally violent gigs, then a human catastrophe which forced the surviving members into a new life as New Order. <em>Touching From a Distance</em>, the 1995 memoir by Curtis's widow Deborah, complicated the narrative by describing a troubled epileptic who struggled to reconcile the demands and temptations of life in a fast-rising band with his responsibilities as a husband and father, but that acquired its own romantic sheen in Anton Corbijn's biopic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/118797/control\" title=\"\"><em>Control</em></a>. Hook's mission is to relate the chaotic day-to-day existence of four young men \u2013&#xa0;kids, really \u2013 before it was smoothed into legend.</p> <p>The demystification process starts with Hook's portrayal of himself as a laddish delinquent who, thunderstruck by punk rock, spontaneously decides to form a band with Salford schoolfriend Bernard Sumner, and only develops his distinctively high, melodic bass-playing style to counteract the shortcomings of a cheap amp. Even as he lays bare Curtis's juvenile side, Hook seems somewhat in awe of the singer: the charismatic highbrow with the arty Belgian girlfriend and the love of Ballard and Burroughs.</p> <p>There's a lovely image of Curtis in the studio, assembling his brutal, beautiful lyrics by rummaging through a carrier bag full of scraps of paper. Hook and Sumner are cast as comic relief, constantly overruled by belligerent producer Martin Hannett (\"a lunatic wizard\") and forbidden from speaking in interviews by manager Rob Gretton. \"He didn't do it to create a mystique around the band but because he thought we were a couple of cretins.\"</p> <p>Despite the stream of earthy anecdotes, which includes <em>Coronation Street</em>'s Pat Phoenix, some frozen chickens and a \"shit sandwich\" (though not all at the same time), there's a terrible sadness at the heart of the book. One reason is Hook's enduring guilt about his friend's suicide. He painfully accuses himself, Sumner and drummer Stephen Morris of \"selfishness, stupidity, wilful ignorance\". You might call it negligent optimism: an eagerness to accept Curtis's upbeat denials of his suffering at face value. Hook ponders calling the book He Said He Was All Right So We Carried On.</p> <p>And so the tragedy infects the farce, as Curtis's ultimate fate casts ostensibly amusing on-the-road antics as symptoms of denial: never mind the worsening fits and self-harming, let's pelt the support band with eggs. Unable to save their friend, Joy Division's survivors proved equally incapable of confronting their loss. Invited to view Curtis's body lying in state, they opted instead for the pub. The sympathetic reader might wonder how many young men would have better handled such horror, but Hook is gripped by guilt, regret and unresolved confusion. \"Sometimes you can see just why he did it, and it makes a kind of sense. Other times, it just makes no fucking sense at all.\"</p> <p>There's another layer of loss, because New Order reunited last year without their bitterly estranged bass player. Several asides hint at a sequel about that band: in the most 1980s sentence you will read all year, Hook claims that he was introduced to cocaine by OMD at the premiere of <em>Pretty in Pink</em>. He admits that his friendship with Sumner, whom he axe-grindingly portrays as remote and ruthless, had cooled even during Joy Division's lifetime, and that Insight, his favourite Joy Division song, \"reminds me of a time when writing music was easy but most of all fun\", implying that, for him, New Order records were neither.</p> <p>Hook believes Curtis's death robbed his bandmates of the \"glue that held us together\" and Rob Gretton's death in 1999 \"left nobody\" in that role. \"Joy Division and then New Order were ships that needed captains, but our captains kept on dying on us,\" Hook writes. Now New Order sail on without him, leaving him alone to trawl through the wreckage of the past, searching for clues as to what went wrong.</p>",

The brothers have other commissions piling up.</p> <p>As admirers of <em>South Park</em>, created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, they are now committed to working on a full script for a show before they pitch to broadcasters, rather than presenting a treatment. This has allowed them to develop their own ideas and keep their sense of humour distinct. The brothers have borrowed another creative habit from Los Angeles. They work on their writing ideas by sitting together in a hot tub. Other projects, created and written by the brothers, close to being greenlit include a six-part comedy series called <em>Posh Boy</em> for BBC3 and their first drama, a 10-part thriller called <em>Bethune</em>, in association with Company Pictures for BBC1.</p> <p>\"I have been friends with Harry for a long time,\" said Scarfe. \"I met him while I was studying art at Chelsea and when he and Jack asked me to do some drawings we got together to develop the show. It has been painstaking work for me. I had to draw it all on paper, so for a while the whole series only existed in my studio, which was quite stressful.\"</p> <p>After Scarfe had completed the drawings, the series was animated by LA-based Rough-Draft, the company behind <em>Family Guy</em>, <em>Futurama</em> and <em>The Simpsons Movie</em>.

  "<p>As the mists begin to clear a little, one word links <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\" title=\"\">BBC</a> travails ancient and modern. It is a most unexpected word for a great media organisation. Simple but deadly: incuriosity.</p> <p>At first sight today, though this worst of crises for our world-class broadcasting corporation is not over (nor will it be until the foul legacy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile </a>is finally fixed), a certain stability seems to be returning. BBC News is able to lead on other stories but its own distress. Meanwhile, <em>Panorama </em>scores a palpable hit in the hell-hole of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-20084254\" title=\"\">Winterbourne View </a>care home, which led to arrests and convictions. But there remains major issues for the BBC \u2013 two different areas of concern involving two different inquiries.</p> <p>One (the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/16/jimmy-savile-scandal-bbc-inquiry-heads\" title=\"\">Dame Janet Smith</a> remit) ostensibly concerns deeds and omissions from long ago. The BBC was not alone in letting Jimmy Savile roam its corridors. Other institutions, hospitals and prisons among them, have their own tawdry secrets to unravel. Though Savile is beyond justice, others may not be. The police are on that case. When they're done, Dame Janet can begin to lay out her lessons and to ask, among other things, how on earth a mighty broadcasting organisation full of journalists trained to sniff out foul play found nothing to pursue over decades in the activities of a celebrity performer whose first hit show featured young teenage girls left to party with the stars. It was a disaster waiting to happen. So, later on, was another show devoted entirely to kids and their dreams. Were the BBC warned? It would seem that they were. Yet incuriosity and inertia ruled.</p> <p>Now, because Dame Janet will be turning over old stones, there'll be a temptation to draw a line under her findings. Jimmy Savile is dead and in his grave and, we'll be told, there has been a fundamental shift in society's attitudes towards child sex abuse.</p> <p>What is much more immediately compelling in headline terms these past few weeks is the show that wasn't broadcast, the light that wasn't shone, the official excuses that withered on the lips. Here's inquiry number two under <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19970059\" title=\"\">Nick Pollard</a>, once boss of Sky News. This will be contemporary in its conclusions, affecting people who hold jobs now but may not hold them much longer. Was Peter Rippon at <em>Newsnight </em>pressured by senior bosses? What are we to make of a civil war between journalists on <em>Newsnight </em>and <em>Panorama,</em> or of the disdain with which many BBC producers, editors and reporters regard the men and women in suits who rule their lives? Is BBC Trust governance too close or too far away?&#xa0;</p> <p>There is, to be frank, a real chattering class dimension to much of this. Readers and viewers outside the media village may all too easily switch off. But that, yet again, will be letting incuriosity win the day.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/george-entwistle\" title=\"\">George Entwistle</a>, the very new director general, met MPs for an early grilling last Tuesday, the most desultory part of an understandably nervy performance came as he attempted to explain how the corporation's internal reporting system works. You're a <em>Newsnight</em> reporter and you've got a good story. So you get your editor to commission it. If necessary, he'll mention it to the deputy head of news who may consult the head of news who can consult the director general as necessary. And the DG's office could theoretically alert the Trust, sitting over down the road. George Entwistle was head of vision last December, a portentous delusion of a title that meant he had a sort of responsibility for all TV and thus for the two Savile tribute specials. Was he warned that <em>Newsnight </em>was on the paedophile case? Helen Boaden, the head of news, touched on it during a chat over a drink apparently, but Entwistle asked nothing more because he was vision and she was news and probity dictates the two must be kept apart.</p> <p>Much of the focus has been on the <em>Newsnight </em>programme that never aired but little is known about the background to the two tribute programmes that were broadcast. If there was widespread rumour and/or speculation about Savile inside the BBC, what lengths did the producers of the tribute programmes go to investigate these? Were the senior executives who authorised the tribute programmes not curious about the stories that had surrounded Savile?</p> <p>Let's take that institutional incuriosity as gospel truth in relation to the <em>Newsnight </em>programme. Let's believe that one good journalist and ex-<em>Newsnight</em> editor (Entwistle ) had no interest in what another good journalist and editor (Rippon) was doing, that he lived in a gossip- and speculation-free environment. You have to ask whether that's any way to run Britain's biggest news operation.</p> <p>You also have to ask that question again when the director general still ruling the roost in 2011, Mark Thompson, says he only vaguely knew about the <em>Newsnight </em>investigation because a reporter, Caroline Hawley, mentioned it briefly at another pre-Christmas drinks do.&#xa0; The hallowed chain of command develops missing links so fast that the people paid to be responsible only hear the mildest whisper of impending doom over a mince pie and mulled wine.</p> <p>As Pollard may soon discover, answers come even more difficult than questions here. There's vital independence in the little boxes of journalism where programme editors rule. It means that no politically implanted DG can tell them what to do without an almighty public fuss. It's the space for manoeuvre and decision-making that keeps the BBC free. No wonder, in this structure, nobody quite knows what's going on. But, in an era where every BBC.com posting and every blog is also supposedly the word of the corporation, you have to wonder whether it needs refitting for new purposes.</p> <p>Even the journalists who work for it seem a bit fogged about what their layers of bosses do all day. Hostility and incomprehension grow up that long chain. Even a trust designed to monitor the corporation vacillates bizarrely between defence and glum predictions that heads may roll when the pressure comes on. There is, lurking behind this lousy business, a challenge that everyone at the BBC, and everyone who cares about good journalism, needs to answer.</p> <p>Incuriosity let Jimmy Savile shut the green room doors. Incuriosity (and cowardice) still leaves too many victims of sex abuse vulnerable in the wider world. And incuriosity seems built into the way the BBC traditionally runs itself.&#xa0;</p> <p>George Entwistle should stay. So should Chris Patten, at least until both the Smith and Pollard reports are published. If they survive those, they then need to become properly curious at last \u2014 and to sort things out.<em>Comments will be turned on later today</em></p>",
  "<p>When the Art Deco doors of Claridge's hotel reopened to the world's well-to-do in 1929 \u2013 oblivious to the looming Great Depression \u2013 they revealed a refurbishment that set the gold standard for Mayfair luxury which endures to this day.</p> <p>Afternoon tea is still served in four sittings from 3pm in the hotel's mirrored foyer, attracting a cast of characters who would not look out of place in a PG Wodehouse tale. Cucumber sandwiches and Earl Grey are consumed, as ever they were, over chatter and clinking china to the strains of light piano melodies.</p> <p>Behind the genteel nostalgia, however, the last two years have placed Claridge's at the centre of one of the most poisonous and unedifying scrambles for control of a London landmark in modern times.</p> <p>In a bygone era, such a disagreement might have been settled over cigars in the hotel's Fumoir bar, but this 21st century clash has played out in the high court, racking up legal bills estimated to be in excess of \u00a325m.</p> <p>At the centre of the spat is Irish property tycoon Paddy McKillen, a usually low-profile investor best known for some hotel co-investments in Dublin with U2 band members Bono and The Edge. In 2004 he and fellow property speculator Derek Quinlan led a consortium of Irish investors who took on colossal loans to acquire the Savoy Group. The business comprised four of London's most prestigious five-star hotels: Claridge's, the Savoy, the Berkeley and the Connaught. After the quick sale of the Savoy, the business was renamed Maybourne; its holding company was Coroin.</p> <p>Today McKillen cuts an isolated figure, despite holding just over a third of Coroin's shares. He is the last man holding out against surrendering control to Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, already owners of the nearby Ritz hotel.</p> <p>The septuagenarian twins, who also own the <em>Telegraph</em> newspaper titles, have long coveted Claridge's, and now Coroin is poised to fall into their grasp. Rearguard court actions by McKillen, alleging that illegal means were used by the Barclays to secure creeping control over the holding company, have failed. An appeal application remains outstanding, but it feels to many concerned that the end of this bitter saga is fast approaching.</p> <p>An increasingly inevitable-looking denouement \u2013 which may start to play out as early as this week \u2013 is likely to seal the brothers' hard-fought victory over rival investors who have been circling the luxury hotel group ever since its leading shareholders turned against one another in 2010 and the business began to hurtle towards a debt crisis.</p> <p>Coroin's towering debts of \u00a3660m fall due for repayment on Wednesday and without a major injection of capital, the company does not appear to have the capacity to meet that deadline. The loans are owned by the Barclay brothers, leaving them in a powerful position.</p> <p>Among those whom the Barclays appear to have outsmarted are Qatar's ruling Al Thani family and Manchester City FC owner Sheikh Mansour, both of whom had looked seriously at seizing control of the five-star hotels \u2013 well established as favoured haunts for super-rich Middle Eastern visitors. To a lesser degree, others who spied an opportunity to prosper from the pandemonium at Coroin included Mayfair financial engineer Robert Tchenguiz and Malaysian tycoon Jho Low.</p> <p>On their behalf and others', attempts were made to navigate the toxic mix of feuding shareholders and distressed debt. Efforts to force a breakthrough came from advisers at Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Lazard as well as Middle Eastern deal broker Amanda Staveley and even former PM Tony Blair. None was able to pull off a decisive deal.</p> <p>On occasion the feuding bordered on farce. In one submission to the court, McKillen recalled how he believed he had deliberately been made to feel awkward during a difficult meeting with Sir Frederick Barclay at the Ritz.</p> <p>\"I specifically remember \u2026 the concierge introduced me to Sir Frederick. However, he initially ignored me and instead asked the concierge why I had been allowed to enter the hotel without wearing a tie. I thought this was a joke: however, Sir Frederick continued to reprimand the concierge ... I felt he intended to cause me embarrassment.\"</p> <p>McKillen's ire stemmed from what appeared to him to be an illegal alliance forged by his old friend Quinlan with the Barclays early last year. Quinlan, a former Dublin tax inspector who had, in better times, transformed himself into one of Europe's most acquisitive property barons, was all but bankrupt. Years ago, he had pledged his one-third stake in Coroin and other assets as collateral for loans from fallen Irish banks. Following the 2008 banking crisis, these loans passed to Nama, Ireland's state-owned toxic loan agency.</p> <p>Cleverly, the Barclay brothers had persuaded Quinlan to enter into a series of agreements that gave them effective control of his stake in Coroin without actually formally buying it from him. For good measure, the brothers went on to buy from Nama the debts against which Quinlan's Coroin shares had been put up as security.</p> <p>This enraged McKillen. Not only did it kill a rescue deal he was trying to advance with the Al Thanis, but was, he claimed, in breach of an agreement between Coroin's original shareholders.</p> <p>The agreement had been designed to bind investors in a common purpose, eliminating suspicion that they might betray one another. Central to it was an undertaking not to sell shares without first offering fellow consortium members the opportunity to buy them. This provision, known as pre-emption rights, was intended to remove the threat of one shareholder, or an outside party, taking a majority interest.</p> <p>At about the same time as striking a deal with Quinlan, the Barclays also snapped up a second holding in Coroin of close to one third, buying out the family interests of wealthy Irishman Peter Green. Pre-emption rights were not triggered as they bought a Cypriot investment vehicle that owned the shares, rather than the shares themselves.</p> <p>McKillen was incandescent with rage and took to the courts. Over several months, evidence spilled out detailing the minutiae of the dealings between the Barclays and Quinlan. Lawyers for the Barclays admitted the twins had effectively started to bankroll the financially distressed Quinlan from late 2010, handing out loans to pay off a tax bill and funding a very comfortable life for the Irishman and his family in Putney, west London.</p> <p>\"My brother and I deeply resent the suggestion that we have been party to an unlawful conspiracy,\" Sir Frederick said in a witness statement, noting that his family had long been friendly with the Quinlans. \"Helping the Quinlan family in their time of need was something that I will never regret and I would not hesitate to do it again if necessary, regardless of anything to do with Coroin, which is irrelevant to how I feel on this issue.\"</p> <p>Hitting back at the behaviour of McKillen, Sir Frederick's statement recalled one telephone row. \"He began with a barrage of what I can only describe as foul-mouthed abuse about Mr Quinlan, calling him a fat so-and-so and using a stream of four-letter words about him&#xa0;\u2026 I do not like or tolerate swearing. I was not going to listen to Mr McKillen's rantings and I cut off the call.\"</p> <p>McKillen's lawyers invited the court to make much of the notoriously private brothers' decision not to attend court and face cross-examination. Living in Monaco and a in castle on their private Channel Island of Brecqhou, the Barclays are rarely photographed and are said to fear kidnapping.</p> <p>McKillen's legal team also sought to draw dark inferences over deleted text messages, emails sent indirectly through the accounts of Barclay relatives, and a partially destroyed laptop belonging to Richard Faber, a senior executive in the family business and Sir Frederick's former son-in-law. But the Barclays' lawyers insist no relevant material was lost or withheld \u2013 and Mr Justice David Richards concurred in a 158-page judgment handed down in August. McKillen might not have liked the Barclays' tactics, but the twins had not broken the law.</p> <p>The courtroom also provided a forum for the brothers' legal team to do a bit of mud-slinging of their own. \"It is a striking feature of this case that Mr McKillen should be alleging impropriety in others&#xa0;\u2026 where he has acted in the same manner or worse,\" suggested the Barclays' counsel, Kenneth MacLean QC.</p> <p>MacLean painted a picture of McKillen, Quinlan and their original consortium as prodigals \"riding a wave of cheap and easy Irish credit\" when in 2004 they stunned the property world by outbidding Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia to win control of Claridge's and the other hotels. In truth, MacLean went on, McKillen's financial position had been almost as dire as that of Quinlan. His business interests had only avoided falling to Nama after a closely fought court battle in Dublin.</p> <p>MacLean told the court that McKillen's determination to secure a lucrative outcome for himself \"would make avarice itself blush\".</p> <p>However hard-fought the Barclays' battle had been for dominance of Coroin's share register, this was only half the war. The destiny of the company, all agreed, was likely to turn on the decision over Coroin's unsustainable debts of \u00a3660m. These borrowings had been in Nama for some time and throughout much of last year the Barclays and rival predators circling Coroin had been in discussions about buying up the debt. Judge Richards later stressed this was \"the single most significant factor\" bearing on Coroin's future.</p> <p>But such a debt purchase presented a major problem. Valuations suggested the business simply could not support this level of indebtedness: \u00a3450m to \u00a3500m, perhaps, but nothing close to \u00a3660m. Yet Nama would not sell for a penny less.</p> <p>The Barclays knew last June that they could get a loan from Barclays bank for \u00a3660m, but only if Sir Frederick and Sir David were able to provide \u00a3260m of personal guarantees. An internal memo from the Barclays camp two months later said: \"The simple truth is the current [share] register when combined with an overindebtedness to the tune of \u00a3160-200m make the refinancing impossible, especially as the banking market moves against us by the day.\"</p> <p>By mid-September, however, such defeatism had abruptly evaporated. Barclays bank had loaned the twins the full \u00a3660m after the required personal guarantees had been given. What triggered this surprise breakthrough remains a private matter and was not explored in court. As a result, however, the brothers took control of Coroin's borrowings \u2013 the last piece of the puzzle required to bid for total control of the group.</p> <p>That debt was due for repayment at the end of last month but the Barclays have extended the deadline until Wednesday of this week. Whether or not they choose to delay once again remains to be seen. Sooner rather than later, however, they are likely to be popping champagne corks in triumph. Barring a successful appeal from McKillen, the only question will be in which hotel Sir Frederick and Sir David choose to celebrate their victory.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Medea </strong>has moved into the suburbs. She is living in a modern house in a street of identical houses. The facade slides open and we see the interior in cross-section: an open-plan room with swanky, crimson kitchen units and two upstairs bedrooms \u2013 it is like looking into a doll's house. Aspirational decor for a woman going nowhere. Medea is having a breakdown. Her husband, Jason, has left her for another woman. Her son, Tom, has lost his tongue. Her neighbours, Sarah (Lu Corfield) and Pam (Amelia Lowdell), are frightened. It is wonderful to watch this at Watford Palace theatre because Mike Bartlett's appropriation of Euripides for <a href=\"http://www.headlongtheatre.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Headlong,</a> a company that continues to earn its reputation for cutting-edge work, persuades one that Greek tragedy has as much of a place in modern society as ever it did in ancient Greece. Why not substitute Watford for Corinth? After all, you have only to open a newspaper to read of parents who go mad and murder their children, the road Medea is heading down.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/02/medea-mother-of-all-roles\" title=\"\">Rachael Stirling</a> is sensational: her complexion chalky white, her hair a rusty mop, an unnerving match for her red eyelids. Her Medea is dressed in tracksuit bottoms and T-shirt (a rock-chick look) and has a restless unpredictability about her. She talks at speed without seeming to take breath; what impresses is the mix of power and powerlessness in her performance. Medea's claim to be a witch contrasts with \u2013 or is perhaps caused by \u2013 her vulnerability. Helplessness makes her dangerous. Even the way she chops carrots horrifies. And the moment when she plunges one hand into a pan&nbsp;of boiling water (a modern cauldron?) is appalling. She will nurse it for the rest of the evening, red and raw \u2013 like her story \u2013 in her cardigan's pocket.</p> <p>Her estranged husband, Jason (Adam Levy), is ordinary in comparison, an unfaithful fellow in a suit. Creon, alias Carter (Christopher Ettridge), is a disagreeable landlord and Aegeus, alias Andrew (entertainingly played by Paul Shelley), who in Euripides laments his lack of children, is a childless neighbour who agrees to lend Medea his Spanish holiday home in return for bearing him a child. It is one of the few scenes that actually gets some laughs.</p> <p>The production's most terrifying moments are its simplest. Medea is alone on the afternoon Jason is to marry his new wife. We watch her watching television. We see her in profile, her back ramrod straight. There is a terrible stillness about her. As she watches, the screen is engulfed with flame like a funeral pyre, as simple a portent as could be. Full marks \u2013 a privet wreath \u2013 to designer Ruari Murchison for his command of the suburban idiom. And to the inspired Mike Bartlett, who also directs, overseeing the production's strange atmosphere (ratcheted up by Tom Mills's alarming music). More than anything, this <a href=\"http://www.watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk/page/medea\" title=\"\"><em>Medea</em></a> shows how depression can tilt into tragedy. As Medea tells her speechless son: \"Adults don't know what they're doing at all, they never have, and the only thing you learn as you get older is how short life is and how you've already messed up more of it than you've got left.\"</p> <p>Howard Brenton's new play <a href=\"http://www.hampsteadtheatre.com/whats-on/2012/55-days/\" title=\"\"><strong>55 Days</strong></a> also heads towards a violent foregone conclusion. It is set during the English civil war at the moment when Parliament is voting whether Charles I should be tried. It ends with his execution. Brenton helps one experience this chapter in history as the extraordinary, unthinkable, bloody turning point it was. The parallel with today is in the uncertainty of the times, the sense of a country on the brink of disaster; this gives the play its charge.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/oct/18/howard-davies-director\" title=\"\">Howard Davies</a> directs with unerring panache. Ashley Martin-Davis's design is resolute, grey, puritanical. Only Charles is dressed for the 17th century in Antwerp lace, buckled shoes and cloak, a hint that he is history while the others, in their suits, serve the future. He is exquisitely played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/mark-gatiss\" title=\"\">Mark Gatiss</a>, a balance of courage, frivolity and bloody-mindedness. His royal error is to believe himself above \u2013 way above \u2013 the law, answerable only to God. The word \"cavalier\" was made for him.</p> <p>It is a play, as you would expect from Brenton, of intellectual grip but with more head than heart. Its greatest strength is in its exploration of authority \u2013 divine and otherwise (a good subject for a writer who has such authority himself). Both Charles and Cromwell believe God is directing them. But who is \"God's Englishman\"? Step forward Douglas Henshall as Cromwell. He is charismatic; there is an amazing relaxation at the centre of his performance as he shows us what leadership is. We witness his changes of heart \u2013 his struggle between the humane desire to compromise and vain, violent impetuosity. The play's most masterly scene describes what never happened: Charles and Cromwell meet over a bottle of wine and find nothing \u2013 and then everything \u2013 to say.</p>",
  "<p>She was Prisoner 965055, the tabloids' killer from hell. He was one of the most influential British newspaper editors of the late-20th century, champion of Nelson Mandela, liberal opponent of Suez and patron of the best and the brightest, from George Orwell and Arthur Koestler to Kenneth Tynan and Clive James. When Myra Hindley became the object of David Astor's philanthropic sympathy, the lives of the murderer and the journalist became strangely connected. It's a story, buried in Astor's private papers, that has never been reported.</p> <p>The troubling relationship of a murderer, and the man who thought he could save her, began when Astor took up Hindley's cause in 1982. She had been in prison for more than 15 years. The facts of the case were still notorious. Pauline Reade, 16, disappeared from Gorton on 12 July 1963 on her way to a disco. Her throat was cut. In the same year, John Kilbride, 12, was abducted on 23 November in Ashton-under-Lyne. He was sexually assaulted, then strangled. In 1964, 12-year-old Keith Bennett vanished on 16 June, walking to his grandmother's house. He was also strangled. Next, on Boxing Day, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, was lured from a fairground, raped, tortured and strangled. Finally, on 6 October 1965, Edward Evans, 17, was beaten to death with an axe.</p> <p>All the bodies were buried on Saddleworth Moor, an unearthly wilderness just outside Manchester. Only Keith Bennett's remains have never been recovered. The killers, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, escaped the gallows by a legal twist of fate. To the British tabloids, they were \u2013 and still are \u2013 the incarnation of evil.</p> <p>Brady was a psychopathic autodidact. He studied the Marquis de Sade and the Nazis, and in 1959 became a stock clerk at Millwards, a chemical works, where he met the 17-year-old Myra Hindley who was working in the typing pool. In the words of a trial reporter: \"She is a big girl with a striking face: fine straight nose, thinnish curved lips, rather hefty chin, blue eyes. Full face she is almost a beauty.\"</p> <p>In fact, from the day of her birth in 1942, Hindley's childhood in working-class Gorton was suffused in emotional distress. As a girl, Myra had suffered physical violence from her stepfather, a demobbed paratrooper. At 13, she witnessed the drowning of a boyfriend in a reservoir and found consolation in the Roman Catholic church. When Brady showed up at Millwards, it was love at first sight.</p> <p>Hindley's diary records her instant attraction. \"Ian wore a black shirt and looked smashing...\" she wrote. \"He's a crude uncouth pig.\" Later, the tone softens: \"I took Ian home; he was ever so gentle.\" As their association developed, Myra became tougher, posher and more flamboyant. She was secretive about the relationship which, mixed with sexual cruelty, was probably a mystery to her, too. There's no doubt she was besotted. In court, she said: \"I loved him... I still love him.\" At their home on the Hattersley overspill estate, Brady and Hindley were a couple out of a horror comic. He would play records of Hitler's speeches or read aloud from <em>Mein Kampf</em>. She would dye her hair a brighter shade of Nordic blonde, or clean one of her revolvers (she hankered for a Luger).</p> <p>At first, Hindley was only an accomplice to Brady's ambition to \"commit the perfect murder\". Eventually, the sadistic killing of kids became a macabre <em>folie \u00e0 deux</em>, finally exposed when Hindley's brother-in-law went to the police. In the spring of 1966, when their trial opened at Chester Crown Court, the press fed off the public's horror. \"Kinky\" was just becoming a household word, and the Moors murders had everything: shallow graves, pornographic sex, the class struggle, sado-masochism, and Nazi fetishism.</p> <p>In the box was a woman whose naturally brown hair \"has been changing colour\", in the words of the <em>Observer</em>, \"from week to week. First silver lilac, then bright canary blonde. At a glance, she looks as smartly turned out as a duchess, but when you look closer you see at once that this is mass-produced supermarket chic; there is an ambience of bubble gum and candyfloss.\" Her voice \u2013 this was especially compelling \u2013 was low, and husky, with a flat, north Midlands accent.</p> <p>The weekend after the 14-day trial concluded with five concurrent life sentences \u2013 the abolition of the death penalty had become law while the prosecution was being prepared \u2013 the headline on the front of the <em>Observer Review</em>, on 8 May 1966, asked: \"What is one to make of the Moors murders?\"</p> <p>It's the question that never ceased to reverberate through the final decades of the 20th century, and haunted David Astor, a man obsessed with the possibility of redemptive transformations. Hindley is dead, but Brady, now 74, lives on, force-fed in Ashworth psychiatric hospital, a skeletal monster of rage and paranoia. Keith Bennett's mother, Winnie, died in August, never knowing the whereabouts of her son's body, and clinging to the hope that he might, after all, be still alive. The media feeding frenzy surrounding the suggestion \u2013 later retracted \u2013 that Brady had written to the dying Winnie with the location of her son's grave, illustrates how, even in 2012, this case remains a force-field of evil.</p> <p>One poignant testament to the ineradicable legacy of the Moors murders lies buried in the <em>Observer's</em> archives. Five boxes of letters and cuttings, the private papers of the editor David Astor, paint a pathetic and sometimes disturbing portrait of the prison life of Hindley, who died 10 years ago this month. Her relationship with Astor, and her doomed attempts to escape her fate as \"a witch\", provide a strange, dark coda to a life lived in hell.</p> <p>From Gladstone on, liberal Britain has had a penchant for taking quixotic stands against intractable expressions of evil in the human condition, even at the risk of ridicule. David Astor, who was editor of the <em>Observer</em> in 1966, was sympathetic to everything represented by Hindley's fate. As a young man, he'd had analysis with Anna Freud and remained in search of existential meaning.</p> <p>Astor wanted the <em>Observer</em> to be the paper of psychological understanding. Under his editorship, the newspaper quested for \"sense and reason\" in a world ruled by insanity, and he was always attracted to apparently insoluble cases. He had campaigned for years to secure the release of Nelson Mandela; the reports he commissioned from Anthony Sampson from the Rivonia trial are credited by many in the ANC as saving Mandela from the gallows.</p> <p>Astor was a NATURAL contrarian, a born journalist and an instinctive liberal campaigner. The Hindley case braided together all his deepest interests. \"What is one to make of the Moors murders?\" No one will ever know if Astor wrote that headline. But it was strangely prophetic. On and off, Astor would devote the last two decades of his life to Myra Hindley's redemption. Through his friendship with Arthur Koestler, he was already interested in prison reform. Hindley exercised a unique fascination for a man like Astor.</p> <p>At her sentencing, the judge had set no limit to her life sentence. Hindley, who would never be released, was told she would not be eligible for parole until she had spent 25 years inside, a tariff that was increased to 30 years in 1985 by the then home secretary, Leon Brittan. With the passage of time, it became clear that she was not being treated like other lifers, and had become a \"political\" case. Like many prominent members of the establishment, Astor believed her treatment was unfair, unjust and a violation of her human rights.</p> <p>From the best of intentions, he would test his admirers to the limit with his devotion to this cause. Astor's relationship with Hindley remains an unsettling sub-plot to the case, motivated by dreams of redemption and salvation. It was an attraction of opposites. Astor encountered Hindley across a chasm of class, inheritance and fortune. Blessed with luxury, comfort and privilege, he had been brought up at Cliveden in the shadow of his mother, Nancy Astor, a dominant, unconventional and pioneering woman.</p> <p>For her part, Hindley's conviction at Chester in 1966 was simply the grim climax to a blighted life. Her role as Ian Brady's accomplice had transformed her into an object of supreme fascination, especially once it became clear that she was intelligent, and vulnerable to remorse and the idea of redemption through the renewal of her Roman Catholic faith. Hindley's capacity for enthralling her supporters remains a disturbing theme in her correspondence with Astor.</p> <p>The eminent QC Helena Kennedy, now a scion of the progressive establishment, was a young defence lawyer when she represented Hindley in court. She retains a vivid memory of the smartly dressed, dark-haired woman who could have been \"an English literature teacher in a good secondary school. Hindley loved to read, and loved <em>Middlemarch</em>,\" Kennedy remembers. \"People say she was 'manipulative', but to me she was a survivor in a grim situation. She always had a strong sense of the horror of what she had done.\"</p> <p>For more than a decade after her conviction, Hindley's chief supporter had been Lord Longford. The other important figure was her \"confessor\", Peter Timms, a prison governor turned priest, who considers her prison treatment \"a scar on the judicial system\". If public opinion was partly to blame for this, Hindley's case was certainly not helped by Longford, who was prone to unfortunate public utterances. Hindley, said Longford, was \"a delightful person\", adding that \"you could loathe what people did, but should not loathe what they were, because human personality was sacred, even though human behaviour was very often appalling\".</p> <p>Longford and Astor had known each other since Oxford. Their paths had often crossed in the beaten ways of liberal postwar Britain, and they shared an interest in prison reform. Astor was agnostic, verging on atheist, Longford a devout Roman Catholic. Both were fascinated by the idea of redemption.</p> <p>Here, in Myra Hindley, was apparently a perfect case study: a fallen woman who had embarked on a personal journey of spiritual and psychological salvation. Early in the 1980s, dismayed by the adverse publicity Longford was getting, Astor stepped in. He was an intensely shy, soft-spoken, man, but capable of decisive, occasionally ruthless, action.</p> <p>Now, according to his widow Bridget, \"David said to Frank [Longford]: 'If you shut up, I'd like to take this on.' He thought that Frank wasn't doing her any good, because he was making the campaign too public. Frank was always interested in publicity in a way that David really wasn't.\"</p> <p>Astor began to correspond with prisoner 965055. Hindley, replying to \"Dear Mr Astor\", seemed to open her heart. \"If the road to hell is paved with good intentions,\" she wrote in November 1985, \"I have a very long, well-paved private road.\" She begged her new correspondent to \"please excuse the somewhat stilted and ungrammatical tone of this letter\" and closed with a little dig. \"Lord Longford, bless him, means well, but the media use and abuse him.\"</p> <p>Astor was hooked. His public journalistic and his private, philanthropic impulses became hopelessly blurred. After their first exchange, he wrote that, \"Incidentally, you write very well. Have you begun writing your thoughts? I think you should, if only to exercise the gift you've got.\" That could have been a journalist looking for a scoop, but at the same time, in a letter to the reporter Maureen Cleave, proposing an interview with Hindley, he described her, with feeling, as \"a surprise, chiefly because of her apparent normality and lack of hang-ups. But she's not ordinary: one feels she's come through some incredible experience and is the nobler for it.\"</p> <p>Astor embarked on a programme of prison visits, took up the parole question and offered media advice. Unsurprisingly, he, who believed in the unconscious guilt of the community, began to evolve a theory about the extremes of public hatred towards Hindley. As he put it in one letter: \"The public associates you with something they are frightened of in themselves\u2026 violence towards children is much more prevalent than people generally like to admit.\"</p> <p>Soon after this correspondence began, there was a new crisis. Towards the end of 1986, the past returned with a vengeance, as it periodically did throughout Hindley's long incarceration. She received \"a heartbreaking letter\" from Winnie Johnson, the mother of Keith Bennett, who wrote that \"not knowing whether my son is alive or dead is literally a living hell... I am on bended knee begging you to end this torture and finally put my mind at rest.\" Hindley replied that she could provide no comfort, not knowing where Brady had buried the body. She consulted Astor about how to handle the press backlash.</p> <p>Astor, to encourage her, replied that, \"The way you run your life under your circumstances is an extraordinary achievement... a remarkable moral and intellectual feat. I won't say spiritual, because I don't know what that means.\" Again, he encouraged her to write her autobiography, a project that occupied their correspondence over two decades.</p> <p>In 1988, addressing the complexities of this project, Astor wrote, \"This book should be the story of your personal pilgrimage or odyssey. In the course of writing your own testament, you should incidentally answer all the questions in the public's mind, but only incidentally, not as your main theme. That theme I feel should be your innocence, your fall and your redemption\u2026\" Various literary advisers, including Elizabeth Longford and a reluctant Diana Athill, were mobilised to help shape the manuscript.</p> <p>Hindley responded by submitting hundreds of pages of childhood memories \u2013 almost a million words \u2013 but never confronting the unbearable reality of the killings. In some frustration, Astor wrote to Timms that it was \"impossible for [Hindley] to write about the serious troubles in her life, beginning with her meeting with Brady. Her long account of the minutiae of a Lancashire girls's everyday life makes very wearisome reading. If it was offered as a book, it would be a disaster.\"</p> <p>This was a moment of clarity. Often Astor's promotion of Hindley's rehabilitation was fiercely rebuffed behind the scenes. When he tried to place the sale of Hindley's life story with literary agent Michael Sissons, his five-page proposal was returned with Sissons's obvious repugnance. Arnold Goodman, a political advisor and establishment fixer of the 1980s, wrote to Astor that the Hindley campaign was \"one of the rare instances where I do not feel totally enthusiastic about one of your causes\".</p> <p>The relationship with Hindley took on a ritualistic quality, through the cycle of Astor's prison visits. In 1990, reflecting on this routine, he wrote that, \"When we come to visit you, we make a day of it, first assembling in Peter's [Timms'] house in Dulwich for coffee, then motoring down through the familiar landscape of north Kent, and finally stopping for a quick snack in a transport caf\u00e9. It makes a sort of break from the week in London and I&#xa0;think we all enjoy the ride itself. I feel we are weaving such a close web of friendship with you that our visits have gradually taken on a family atmosphere. I hope you feel the same.\"</p> <p>The longer Hindley remained in prison, passing 30 years of her sentence in 1996, the more Astor's involvement in her plight blossomed into a real friendship. Hindley also met Astor's wife, Bridget. Mrs Astor has vivid memories of Hindley's life as a long-term prisoner.</p> <p>\"It was not like visiting someone in prison,\" she remembers. \"Myra had huge dignity. She was very impressive. She also had a very good sense of humour. There was nothing creepy about Myra. She was very matter-of-fact. She knew her crimes were terrible and she didn't pretend otherwise.\" Peter Timms recalls an articulate, chain-smoking woman who wept freely at her predicament and was open about the struggles of her early life. Within Cookham Wood (and later Highpoint prison, near Newmarket), Hindley was an object of fascination, a&#xa0;response she attempted to defuse with her \"normality\". She remained, however, a powerful and highly intelligent character who could bend the prison's organisation to her will.</p> <p>She came to learn that her every move was tabloid fodder. Fleet Street was a jungle in which \"the story\", true or false, a cocktail of blind quotes and unsourced gossip, was everything. Innocuous-seeming correspondence invariably turned out to have been arranged by the <em>Daily Mirror </em>or the <em>Sun</em>.</p> <p>In her cell, Hindley developed a routine of studied normality, circumscribed by her limited interaction with the other inmates, meetings with famous visitors, establishment liberals such as Merlyn Rees, Ludovic Kennedy and Cardinal Hume, and occasional visits from her family. She listened to Radio 4 (<em>Book at Bedtime, Kaleidoscope</em>), read improving books and did the crossword. It was, she wrote, \"a strange kind of paralysis\".</p> <p>Hindley also found consolation in a succession of prison relationships. Bridget Astor insists that Hindley was \"not a lesbian\", and Helena Kennedy agrees. Both women say that Hindley's relations with prison officers was a&#xa0;uniquely female kind of attachment, and a substitute for the love of men. In 1991, the woman Hindley called \"the love of my life\", Trisha Forrester, also became the object of Astor's patronage, bringing an awkward dimension to a complicated relationship. For a while Trisha and her collie Jacob occupied the top-floor flat in the Astor's London home.</p> <p>Astor's support for Hindley had many facets. There was his interest in her education, her Open University degree, her reading and writing. Once Bridget had been introduced, the Astors sent clothes and make-up. From time to time there was speculation about Hindley getting a new identity and moving abroad, possibly to France, Australia or Vancouver. (Today, the relocation of lifers on parole and the adoption of new identities is commonplace.)</p> <p>The interminable discussions about the campaign to secure Hindley's freedom were always wrecked on an immovable obstacle: successive Labour and Conservative home secretaries' refusal to risk the wrath of Middle England and recommend parole. Astor himself never lost hope in her ultimate redemption. \"As you know,\" he wrote in December 1989, \"the more you show yourself to be both normal and intelligent, the more people will want to know how anyone like that could have lived on [another] level. Until you can somehow find a convincing way of describing that, people will be puzzled and confused.\" Sometimes, the campaigning journalist became prey to embarrassing hyperbole, at one moment going so far as to compare her spiritual development to that of Mandela's.</p> <p>On her side, Hindley wrote, \"You are much loved\" and sent him a birthday card with kisses from herself, her lover and the dog, Jacob. Astor reciprocated with declarations of \"admiration\" for her courage, fortitude and patience. His support for Hindley occasionally became a matter for hostile debate. In 1990, the <em>Daily Star </em>reported: \"Mega rich aristocrat David Astor has opened his heart and his wallet to Moors monster Myra Hindley. The elderly toff has agreed to bankroll her High Court action\u2026\"</p> <p>Astor's defence was always: \"It's bad for the public to read dangerous nonsense that this woman is some sort of witch.\" The popular revulsion towards Hindley, however, was impossible to eradicate. In 1993, when Astor justified his continued financial support of Hindley, Janie Jones, a one-time singer jailed for supplying call girls, who had become friends with Hindley in prison, published <em>The Devil and Miss Jones</em>. \"She made fools of fellow inmates,\" wrote Jones. \"And she made fools of those influential people who committed the crime of offering compassion and humanity. She conned Lord Longford rotten. And she conned me, too.\"</p> <p>By the turn of the century, it was obvious that Hindley was doomed to die in jail. In a sad aside to one of her letters she reached a moment of belated realism, \"I don't want an agent. I will deal with things myself. The only way to treat the tabloids is by silence.\" But Astor could not give up, though his health was failing. In 2000, he told a fellow campaigner: \"What is important is speed. I am 88, so I am keen to achieve something soon.\" A year later, he was dead. At his memorial, his <em>Observer</em> colleague Anthony Sampson, who had made his reputation reporting on Mandela's struggle against apartheid, noted that, \"David seemed to welcome the challenge of impossible people.\"</p> <p>With hindsight, the challenge of Hindley's case seems worse than impossible. In truth, it was Promethean. Whatever restitution she attempted, the hated child murderer could never be forgiven, or forgotten. The public would always swoop down to eviscerate her. Her supporters could hope she would find salvation, but were likewise doomed to disappointment. Did the liberal establishment torment her with its sympathy? Possibly. One reading of the Astor files leads to the inescapable conclusion, a view shared by Hindley herself, that it might have been better, and more merciful, if she had been hanged at the outset.</p> <p>After Astor's death, hope faded and Hindley's health, never good, deteriorated. Prisoner 965055 had the limited comfort of her room at Highpoint, but was sinking fast, with no prospect of freedom. When she died, of a suspected heart attack, in November 2002, the police sealed her funeral route. The ceremony passed off without fuss. But there could be no redemption. Fleet Street gave her its most brutal send-off: GO TO HELL screamed the front page of the <em>Daily Express</em>.</p>",
  "<p>\"Public space\" is something that most people involved in the design and planning of buildings \u2013 planners, developers, architects \u2013 say is a good thing. Any development of flats or offices, above a certain size, comes with its patches of grass or granite, seasoned with bits of art or fountain and suffused with a vague ambition to be like Las Ramblas, the Piazza Navona or whatever. I have never heard anyone in the business say that public space should be suppressed and stamped out, yet it is rare for the respect it commands to be matched by a close interest in what it actually is and what makes it work.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.muf.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Muf architecture/art </a>is a practice led by the artist Katherine Clarke and the architect Liza Fior. They \"want to see what happens if you are Forrest Gumpishly literal about the claims people make\". Where others might mouth platitudes about social inclusion, or regeneration, or legacy, or public realm, they want to find out what they actually mean and realise them in practice. They choose to treat truisms as if they're true.</p> <p>I have long been sympathetic to this attitude and so I find myself on some land next to the busy tracks in and out of East Croydon station, part surrounded by works of middle-period Colonel Seifert, stubby, mannered 1960s towers from the time when Croydon aspired to be a little Manhattan. I would call this spot a wasteland, except that part of the muf philosophy is that every place has some value. Here, it turns out, there are 76 species of plant, to which attention is drawn by some winding paths and little&#xa0;hillocks.</p> <p>This spot is officially called Ruskin Square, in honour of the fact that the grandmother of the great, mad, Victorian aesthete once owned a pub here. Muf \"wanted to put the Ruskin back into Ruskin Square\", so they try to make real some of his ideas. Muf see the weedy landscape, ambitiously, as a minor version of the Lake District he loved, or at least as a recollection of his ability to see beauty in humble things.</p> <p>Muf were also inspired by Ruskin's belief that work without play is a meaningless endeavour. Their clients are the developers <a href=\"http://www.stanhopeplc.com/?page=21&amp;id=443\" title=\"\">Stanhope</a>, which wanted an open space to serve the commercial development that will arrive here some time in the future. Muf wanted to make a place that would be an asset to the area as soon as possible and thereby be richer than \"lobby landscapes and pointless trees\" when office workers eventually turn up.</p> <p>They installed two cricket practice nets, long oblongs whose mesh walls create a diverting layered effect. They are there because muf found out that Afghan refugees, who come to Croydon because the UK Border Agency is based here, like playing cricket and don't have anywhere much to do so. So there the refugees are, along with other nationalities and sometimes assisted by coaches from Surrey County Cricket Club, thwacking ball with bat, against the background rumble of trains.</p> <p>With the wind blowing through the vegetation as well, the landscape consists of several kinds of motion. The place should also be animated by a simple connection muf made, via a door in the rear wall, to the Warehouse theatre, which backs on to the site. But unfortunately cuts by the local council closed it.</p> <p>Ruskin Square exemplifies several aspects of the muf method, such as placing the human activities in a space above its physical form and therefore a belief that a project neither begins nor ends. Rather, it grows out of what is already there and creates a setting for what might happen in the future. \"The temporary inscribes the ambitions for the permanent,\" says Liza&#xa0;Fior.</p> <p>They have an ability to make unlikely connections, an associative imagination on overdrive, that manages to link Ruskin, weeds, Afghans, cricket, the theatre and a few other things in a single place. They are romantic, but also precise, and their work is based on the close observation of the sites they are given. They have a way of rearranging the cliches of their business \u2013 greenery, art, engagement with communities \u2013 such that they are not cliches any more.</p> <p>If activity comes first, this does not mean they are uninterested in fixed architecture: they scatter memorable and enticing elements about the landscape, such as a fictional ruin or a strategically placed bench, in a way reminiscent of English landscape gardens. \"Embracing the picturesque of incident\" is what they call it, \"a way of finding yourself in a place\". They create new realities out of the actual, such as the presence of the refugee cricketers, and imaginative embellishment, such as the weeds as Lake District.</p> <p>They have been working like this since the early 1990s, when Fior was teaching at the Architectural Association and Clarke was a technician there. \"We found ourselves in a gender minority,\" says Clarke, and they saw in each other \"someone with whom you could have a different conversation\".</p> <p>Each had had experiences of collective political idealism. Clarke had been part of the Greenham Common women's peace camp, and as a girl Fior had witnessed the bloodless revolution in Portugal, where her father lived. \"It showed how much a place can change,\" she says, \"but also how fragile that change is.\" Both were interested in seeing, as Clarke puts it, \"how you can democratise the power of art without losing that power\".</p> <p>Someone called Clarke, Fior and their friends \"the mufia\" and when they found themselves working together, and had to choose a name for their nascent practice, they chose muf. It's a name that still causes a certain amount of discomfort in clients and others obliged to say it (and Ruskin would have struggled with it). It declares that they are not greatly concerned with commercial acceptance and it has undoubtedly cost them work \u2013 it is horribly tempting to say that they are the Pussy Riot of architecture, but a decade or two in advance of the Russians.</p> <p>They have pursued their ideas with consistency and some obstreperousness, plugging the gaps in public patronage with their own energy. \"No one ever says do something beautiful,\" says Fior, \"so there's always an unsolicited brief. We always make research that no one pays for. It's a terrible business model.\" The main difference between their practice at the beginning and now, she says, \"is that we've got better at not getting sacked. Touch wood.\"</p> <p>All through the Blair years they seriously pursued the ideals that his government was supposed to believe in, such as social inclusion, without being greatly rewarded. Now they find themselves more in demand then ever before. London 2012 brought them work in Hackney Wick, on the fringe of the Olympic Park, and on \"High Street 2012\", the route through the East End where the marathon was going to be run and then wasn't. Now they are working with the developer <a href=\"http://about.taylorwimpey.co.uk/Information-Centre/News-and-Events/Schools-and-Community/chobham-manor.htm\" title=\"\">Taylor Wimpey on Chobham Manor</a>, the first new neighbourhood in the Olympic Park. Not long ago, it would have been impossible to imagine this happening.</p> <p>Sometimes, they're hired in a tokenistic way, in order to fulfil a public promise at minimal cost. However, Sebastian Balcombe of Taylor Wimpey shows every sign of getting the muf message. \"Their most powerful idea is that you grow a place through interim uses,\" he says. He also likes the fact that they are not the \"yes men\" he finds some of his consultants to be: \"Liza is a fantastic character, absolutely brilliant and very frustrating. They fight for their ideas. They make life difficult in a positive way.\"</p> <p>It is remarkable to hear a developer talk like this. Usually, they seek the smoothest possible path to getting the job done. It could, conceivably, be a sign that muf's ideas are at last reaching a wider audience. I hope so. In their understanding of public space, as something mobile and shaped by activity, but also as something singular and distinct in each manifestation, they have got it more right than anyone else in the business.</p>",
  "<p>Best known for the Hornblower series of sea stories, CS Forester (1899-1966) also wrote thrillers set in suburban London. <em>The Pursued</em> (1935) is a story of revenge rather than detection, in which the identity of the murderer is clear from the start. Housewife Marjorie returns home to a smell of gas and the sight of her babysitter \u2013 her younger sister Dot \u2013 with her head in the oven, dead. But Marjorie's husband, Ted, is calm \u2013 suspiciously so. And he happens to be a womanising brute who sells gas appliances for a living.</p> <p>When it emerges that Dot was pregnant, her mother plots to punish Ted by pushing Marjorie into the arms of his handsome young assistant at work \u2013 and wait for lust and jealousy to do the rest. Daring for the time \u2013 the plot turns on Marjorie's menstrual cycle \u2013 <em>The Pursued</em> offers a masterclass in how to write about sex and desire without the latitude that writers would now take for granted. The storyline is sensational but the treatment is serious and the novel conveys the misery of an abusive marriage without plumbing its depths.</p> <p>Throughout, there's a sense of a novelist in total control of his material; the narrative is seeded with incidental detail that becomes crucial when you least expect it. Forester's shifting point of view feels psychologically persuasive, whether it's focused on Marjorie's four-year-old son, playing with sandcastles at the seaside, or on Ted, threatening to beat his daughter if Marjorie won't sleep with&#xa0;him.</p> <p>It seems incredible that the manuscript was lost for six decades. An endnote by Lawrence Brewer, a Forester enthusiast who purchased it when it turned up at auction in 1999, calls it a \"little masterpiece\"; he's not wrong.</p>",
  "<p>As a scientist, I like to feel as if I am exploring a cosmic mystery of the greatest significance. I am awestruck by the beauty that saturates the laws of physics and suppose that what I am doing is rather more than merely helping to solve an elaborate crossword puzzle. Or perhaps I am just too optimistic \u2013 brashly engaging in an ultimately futile attempt to lift my spirits in the face of a meaningless and eternal oblivion.</p> <p>Fortunately, I don't spend much time on the horns of that dilemma, although that did briefly change recently when I had the privilege to attend a <a href=\"http://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/en/conferences/policy-programmes/human-rights-democracy-and-governance/?view=Conference&amp;id=762366482\" title=\"\">conference</a> on the banks of Lake Geneva organised by <a href=\"http://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/en/\" title=\"\">Wilton Park</a>, a forum for international dialogue, in partnership with Cern. The event drew together particle physicists, cosmologists, theologians and philosophers in the name of dialogue and mutual understanding. Some might say that Cern should stick to science but I don't agree. A major reason for the popularity of fundamental physics is that it is seen to tackle some pretty \"deep\" questions \u2013 the kinds of questions that really \"mean\" something \u2013 and the quest for meaning is not something best left to scientists. With the latest ideas in physics seeming to suggest the possibility of \"a universe from nothing\" (the title of cosmologist Lawrence Krauss's latest book), the stakes do seem rather high. I think it makes sense to ensure that the theologians are up to speed with the science, but I also think that scientists benefit from contemplating the wider implications of their discoveries.</p> <p>By overstating science's power and not acknowledging its limitations, we risk fostering the growth of a religion-substitute, with the scientists as high priests. Such hubris not only irritates people, but more significantly it risks promoting the misconception that science deals with certainty \u2013 and that is the very antithesis of good science. Science, which advances through the weight of evidence, is inherently uncertain. Sometimes, the evidence is so overwhelming that it would be unreasonable to doubt it; at other times, it is equivocal and harder to interpret. There is no doubting that science is supreme in its domain. How a microchip works is not a matter of opinion; equally, we have an excellent grasp of how atoms operate, while the evidence that the Big Bang took place 13.7&#xa0;billion years ago is compelling. If we want to figure out how something works, then science is usually the tool for the job \u2013 from the action of an electric motor to what happened at the birth of the universe.</p> <p>But the questions that science can tackle are nonetheless limited in scope. For most people, the deep questions of science do not shape their lives. For example, science does not touch on whether the universe has any point to it and it cannot even hope to answer the question of why there is something rather than nothing.</p> <p>In recent years, physicists have begun to anticipate that the matter that composes the entire visible universe might have been created spontaneously \u2013 a mere consequence of the instability of empty space. Superficially, then, it might seem that we have the answer: there is something rather than nothing because \"nothing\" is unstable (rather in the way that a pencil balancing precariously on its point is unstable). That is pretty exciting stuff, but it isn't really an answer to the question and, in any case, \"nothing\" in quantum physics is far from that \u2013 it is a seething maelstrom of activity, to the extent that one might view the substantial universe we inhabit as the froth on top. Awestruck as I am by the laws of physics, no amount of wishful thinking can allow me to make the mistake of supposing that a law by itself can ever create anything. In addition to being unable to conjure up material existence, the laws of physics cannot create meaning either.</p> <p>In some people's minds, science and religion stand in stark opposition, but is this really the case? Certainly, years of being a scientist have led me to doubt pretty much everything I thought I knew. Secure and certain knowledge is a rare thing and I am not surprised that scientists often find religious faith hard to swallow. That said, scientists do often act with what seems to me to be something like faith: a faith in scientific truths perhaps or in the humbling significance of nature's beauty. Perhaps \"faith\" is too strong \u2013 enthusiastic optimism might be better. Whatever the case, the importance of science lies not only in fighting ignorance and the building of better theories \u2013 it is important too because of the way it inspires glory and wonder. In that regard, at least, science and religion are united.</p>",
  "<p>The three members of Massive Attack were invited to do a DJ set on a French radio programme some time back in the early 90s. Having written about and befriended the group back then, I was lucky enough to receive one of the few cassette-only recordings of the set. It offered an illuminating glimpse of the musical undercurrents they'd drawn on in making their groundbreaking debut album, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Lines-Massive-Attack/dp/B000000WHX\" title=\"\"><em>Blue Lines</em></a>, released in 1991.</p> <p>Alongside rare hip-hop and soul tracks their set threw up some surprising choices: the pioneering Chicago house tune <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFuujExs03A\" title=\"\">Can You Feel It</a> by Mr Fingers; the brooding spoken-word track Sons and Daughters by the Neville Brothers; the discordant Poptones by John Lydon's post-punk collective Public Image Ltd.</p> <p>With Soul II Soul's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Club-Classics-Volume-One-Soul/dp/B000025JVA\" title=\"\"><em>Club Classics Vol. One</em> (1989)</a> and Young Disciples' <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Road-Freedom-Young-Disciples/dp/B000026EFU/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350917647&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><em>Road to Freedom</em></a> (1991), <em>Blue Lines</em> is now seen as an album that marked the coming of age of British dance music. More than that, it highlighted the breadth of the group's influences and suggested a range of compositional and textural possibilities that resonate in popular music to this day. Now, 21 years after its release, <em>Blue Lines </em>has been remastered and repackaged for a seemingly inexhaustible pop heritage market in both a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Lines-Massive-Attack/dp/B0094RCD5U/ref=sr_1_7?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350918048&amp;sr=1-7\" title=\"\">regular</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Lines-VINYL-Massive-Attack/dp/B0094RCD14/ref=sr_1_8?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350917912&amp;sr=1-8\" title=\"\">deluxe</a> edition. It's brighter, clearer and sharper, but the standout songs still sound utterly unlike anything before or since in their seamless merging of propulsive beats, brooding melodies and dark atmospherics. You can marvel again at the epic sweep of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWmrfgj0MZI\" title=\"\">Unfinished Sympathy</a>, the defiant thrust of Safe from Harm and the narcotic sway of Daydreaming, songs that have influenced two generations of electronic musicians, from Radiohead, Moby and Unkle through to Air, Hot Chip and Burial and on to such disparate contemporary artists as the xx and Emeli Sand\u00e9.</p> <p>\"Massive Attack and <em>Blue Lines</em> are part of the UK's musical DNA,\" says Labrinth (Tim McKenzie), the young English producer and artist. \"The group have had a huge influence on UK production. They've influenced music around the world, of course, but the UK more than anywhere.\"</p> <p>Much to the dismay of its creators, <em>Blue Lines</em> is also viewed in pop historical terms as the prototype of trip-hop, a downbeat genre that merged elements of American hiphop, funk and Jamaican dub reggae into a somnambulant, skunk-fuelled soundtrack to British inner-city life. It certainly paved the way for two acclaimed debut albums in the trip-hop vein \u2013 Portishead's dense and sometimes overwrought <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dummy-Portishead/dp/B000001FI7/ref=sr_1_3?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350919280&amp;sr=1-3\" title=\"\"><em>Dummy</em></a><em> </em>(1994) and Tricky's darkly mesmeric <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Maxinquaye-Tricky/dp/B000001E7V/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350919377&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><em>Maxinquaye</em></a> from 1995 \u2013 as well as the more well-mannered beats of acts such as Morcheeba and Zero 7.</p> <p>When <em>Blue Lines</em> came out, though, it sounded \u2013 despite its knowing nods to the older genres of funk, jazz fusion, old-school hip-hop and dub reggae, and its relatively faithful cover of William DeVaughn's 1972 smooth soul classic, Be Thankful For What You Got \u2013 like the birth of something new: a merging of the rootsy and the sophisticated, the soulful and the state of the art, the past and the future.</p> <p>Massive Attack emerged out of the 1980s sound system scene in Bristol, part of a generation who came of age as hip-hop came overground. Before they were Massive Attack, the three core members \u2013 Robert \"3D\" Del Naja, Andrew \"Mushroom\" Vowles and Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall \u2013 belonged to Bristol's Wild Bunch sound system crew, an extended collective whose members also included Tricky and future Soul II Soul member Nellee Hooper, both of whom would contribute to<em> Blue Lines,</em> as well as lesser-known local characters DJ Milo and Willy Wee. 3D was also a graffiti artist of some repute.</p> <p>The Wild Bunch DJed at the Dug Out club and at street parties in Bristol alongside <a href=\"http://bristolarchiverecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-three-stripe-collection-1985-1990\" title=\"Smith and Mighty\">Smith and Mighty</a>, a duo that produced the first Massive Attack single, Any Love, in 1988, featuring local singer Carlton on vocals. (The track was later reworked for <em>Blue Lines</em>, with new vocals by Tony Bryan.)</p> <p>The very first inkling of what would be dubbed the Bristol sound was the Wild Bunch's spartan treatment of Bacharach and David's classic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sHcTS9k21E\" title=\"\">The Look of Love</a>, released in 1988 on 4th &amp; Broadway. It remains an intriguing song, a sketchy template for what was to follow. Listening to it now, you can hear traces of the enduring reggae style called lover's rock \u2013 the romantic song, soulful vocals of Shara Nelson and the pared-down beats. What's missing is the urgency of Massive Attack's best music. That would come later, after the Wild Bunch imploded in the wake of one too many petty feuds.</p> <p>From the off, Massive Attack were an effortlessly odd bunch. They seemed, on first meeting, to be utterly lacking in direction, much less ambition, content to drift on their own instincts and slo-mo energy. Trying to interview them in any depth was futile: they avoided direct answers, lapsed into the kind of coded conversations that only the closest of friends can indulge in, made jokes and took every opportunity to turn the conversation to anything but music. Mushroom, in particular, seemed tuned into a frequency all his own. I remember he seldom said much, but listened intently to everything, often laughing at something he alone found amusing. When he spoke, it tended to be cryptic. He referred to everyone as \"Jack\" and would ask questions like, \"So, Jack, how much do you think the moon weighs, then?\"</p> <p>Years later, when I mentioned our early encounters to Daddy G, he happily admitted that the group had no idea what was expected of them in terms of press and were genuinely uninterested in fame or attention. It was refreshing but frustrating.</p> <p>Yet from the start they drew a succession of like-minded souls into their orbit, the first being the singer Neneh Cherry, and, soon after, her partner, the producer Cameron McVey. (A very young Mushroom appears as a DJ on the video for Cherry's 1988 hit <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsRz3TJDEY\" title=\"\">Buffalo Stance</a>.) Cherry immediately saw the possibilities of Massive Attack's cut-and-paste music, because it chimed with her own aesthetic. She had attitude to burn, though, while the Bristol crew were content to drift, their work rate informed by the slow pace of their native city and by what might be called the spliff consciousness that determined not just the bass-heavy pulse of their music but the worldview of their lyrics, which often tended towards the insular and the paranoid.</p> <p>\"We were lazy Bristol twats,\" Daddy G would say later about the protracted gestation of <em>Blue Lines</em>. \"It was Neneh who kicked our asses and got us in the studio. We recorded a lot at her house, in her baby's room. What we were trying to do was create dance music for the head rather than the feet.\"</p> <p>The album's production is credited to Massive Attack, Cameron McVey and the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/19/jonny-dollar-obituary-trip-hop\" title=\"\">Jonny Dollar</a>, to whom the new remastered version is dedicated. He died from cancer in 2009, aged 45. Who did what remains a mystery, but Dollar's role was integral, not least because he shaped the group's often vague ideas \u2013 samples, beats, raps \u2013 into something cohesive and often dramatic.</p> <p>Staying true to the crew ethos of hip-hop, Massive Attack were not a pop group per se. Like Soul II Soul and various constantly fluid rap outfits, they were a collective who did not play any instruments themselves and employed other artists to augment \u2013 and in some cases \u2013 define their electronically driven sound and vision. For the recording of <em>Blue Lines</em>, Tricky was still in the fold, rapping and co-writing on three songs. (Twenty-one years on, the extent of his contribution remains a source of friction between him and the group.) Nellee Hooper showed up from time to time with advice and the odd richly hued remix, but Mushroom and Dollar seem to have been the technicians and main orchestrators of the Massive Attack sound.</p> <p>Listening to <em>Blue Lines</em> now, I can hear all kinds of echoes: from Brian Eno to Ennio Morricone, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry to the early electro hip-hop of Man Parrish, but what strikes me most forcefully is how the best songs are those that feature the extraordinary lyrics of Shara Nelson and her equally dramatic delivery of them. In September, 1990, while working for the now defunct style magazine, <em>The Face</em>, I was sent a pre-release press-only 12 inch single of <a href=\"http://massiveattack.ie/wiki/daydreaming/\" title=\"\">Daydreaming</a>, which I took home and played incessantly, entranced not just by the downbeat rapping style but by Nelson's dreamy, dislocated coda \u2013 \"I quietly observe standing in my space\u2026 daydreaming\". Everything from the dramatic cover designed by 3D \u2013 an orange flame against a deep blue background with the group's name in bold letters \u2013 to the seamless blending of musical styles, suggested an already fully formed aesthetic.</p> <p>Even this didn't prepare me, or anyone else, for the epic semi-symphonic sweep of the follow-up, Unfinished Sympathy, which, legend has it, started out as a studio jam with Mushroom playing around on a keyboard to a spartan drum machine while Nelson sang whatever came into her head. The recorded version, finished at Abbey Road studios, utilised a 50-piece orchestra to accentuate the song's dramatic surge. Again, though, it's the emotional intensity of Nelson's voice and lyrics that define the song as much as the production or the musical bricolage, particularly in the heartstopping chorus: \"Like a soul without a mind/ In a body without a heart/ I'm missing every part\". <em>Blue Lines</em>, for all the bickering and defections that followed in its wake, is an album that effortlessly transcends the sum of its individual parts.</p> <p>The music writer Simon Reynolds has noted that <em>Blue Lines</em> marked a distinct shift in gear and tone for electronic music \"towards a more interior, meditational sound\" and that the tracks on <em>Blue Lines</em> move to what he calls \"spliff tempos\". That is only partially true. The defiant grandeur of Unfinished Sympathy does not adhere to that model nor does the thunderous charge of Safe from Harm, propelled by its percussive sample from jazz-rock drummer Billy Cobham's furiously complex track Stratus. (Massive Attack's samples are also a clue to their singularity: a snatch of Tom Scott's smooth jazz runs though the title track, and Wally Badarou's Mambo underpins Daydreaming. Both, like the Cobham sample, suggest someone in the group had distinct \"muso\" tendencies. My money's on Mushroom, who was certainly the most obsessive, oddball and perhaps gifted member.)</p> <p>Both Daydreaming and Safe from Harm were accompanied by atmospheric videos by the young director Baillie Walsh who then directed the now famous video for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWmrfgj0MZI\" title=\"\">Unfinished Sympathy</a> in which Nelson walks along West Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles, singing the song as if oblivious to the odd cast of street characters she encounters, while the group members fall into step behind her in cameo roles. The result of a single long take filmed on Steadicam, it remains a benchmark in modern video direction, more a breathtaking short film than a mere pop promo.</p> <p>With the release of <em>Blue Lines</em> in 1991, Massive Attack were on a creative roll but seemed unaware of their impact or the shape of their future. I accompanied the group to Jamaica in early 1992 to write a feature for the <em>Guardian</em> around the filming of the Dick Jewell-directed video for their planned fifth single, Hymn of the Big Wheel, which featured the veteran reggae singer Horace Andy on lead vocals. In between filming, we visited Studio One, met the great reggae rhythm section Sly and Robbie, bought dozens of old and new reggae 45s, went to Prince Jammy's studio, crossed the hills to Ocho Rios, were held up by armed men at a roadblock and bonded over Appleton's rum and the inevitable bags of Jamaican spliff. Despite a budget of around 60 grand, no video ever appeared.</p> <p>I met them, again, at the filming of another Baillie Walsh video for <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xctiwd_massive-attack-be-thankful-for-what_music\" title=\"\">Be Thankful for What You've Got</a>, which consisted of a stripper doing her act while miming the song in Raymond's Revue Bar in Soho, London. I sat with the group in the darkened auditorium, wondering what their role in the video was. They did not have one \u2013 unless you count the glimpse of a few shadowy figures exiting the strip club towards the end of the act. You can now see the video online but, unsurprisingly, it was never shown on MTV or the BBC. The group seemed unconcerned by these setbacks. They moved to their own unpredictable beat, so much so that I would not have put money on them still being with us today, so laidback was their attitude, so lackadaisical their work rate, so uninterested were they in press or promotion. But Massive Attack, against all the odds, are now seasoned survivors.</p> <p>They are not, though, the Massive Attack that made <em>Blue Lines</em>. Tricky departed amid some rancour not long after the release of the album, as did Shara Nelson, their first and greatest singer, both claiming they had not been given enough recognition for their contributions to the Massive Attack sound. Since his extraordinary debut, <em>Maxinquaye</em>, Tricky has followed his own increasingly erratic path, while in a sad development Shara Nelson became deeply troubled and was last year given a 12-month community order for persistent harassment of the Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong, whom she claimed was her husband and the father of her child.</p> <p>Other great guest vocalists worked with the group following Nelson's departure, beginning with Tracey Thorn on the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epgo8ixX6Wo\" title=\"\">title track</a> of the group's equally brilliant second album, <em>Protection</em>, and erstwhile Cocteau Twin Liz Fraser on the hypnotic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H33xhb5L9w\" title=\"\">Teardrop</a> from their third album, <em>Mezzanine</em>. Then Massive Attack splintered again when Mushroom, the great oddball musical genius behind those albums, departed for reasons that remain clouded in mystery but probably had something to do with the smalltown claustrophobia of the Bristol scene and the inevitable clashes of ego and direction that beset all great groups at some time or another. (I spoke to him by phone a few times last year when he was finishing his long-anticipated solo album but have not heard from him since. He seemed in good spirits.)</p> <p>Massive Attack endure in the form of 3D, Daddy G and a proper group playing proper instruments that accompanies them when they play live. The collective ethos has been abandoned for something more rigid and functional.</p> <p>The original idea that was Massive Attack \u2013 the collective, elastic, shape-shifting but essentially tight-knit, identity that helped make <em>Blue Lines </em>such a groundbreaking album has long since evaporated. The album, in all its newly polished glory, remains: a testament to a time when their vision was a truly collective one that challenged the notion of the pop group as well as the pop song. It still seems odd to me that the lumpen, guitar-fuelled Britpop years followed its release, the old order re-establishing itself in the most conservative fashion as if <em>Blue Lines had </em>never happened. Twenty-one years on, those guitars still sound old and all too familiar. <em>Blue Lines</em>, though, is like a blueprint for a different kind of pop future: stranger, richer, day-dreamier.</p> <p><em>Blue Lines: 2012 Remix/Remaster is out on 19 November as a CD, download or deluxe box set (EMI)</em></p>",

  "<p>This week brings Halloween, the time of year when ghastly deeds are generally afoot. Apt, then, that the banking industry will update the City on third-quarter trading, at a time when businesses are moaning that the banks are bleeding them dry. In the sweetest of ironies, Barclays has chosen the day of the ghoulish festival itself to allow its new chief executive, Antony Jenkins, to explain how the bank has fared since the undignified departure of predecessor Bob Diamond.</p> <p>Diamond paid the price for the Libor-rigging scandal now hanging over many of its rivals. Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and HSBC have all admitted to co-operating with international regulators on the matter. RBS chief Stephen Hester has gone as far as he can to prepare expectations that the bailed-out bank will be slapped with a big fine when watchdogs around the globe finally finish their investigations into the manipulation of interest rates.</p> <p>But Libor is not the only skeleton in the cupboard for this industry. Barclays, again, is the bank that reminded the City about the scale of the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, with its shock announcement earlier this month that it needed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/18/barclays-increases-ppi-provision-700m\" title=\"\">put aside another \u00a3700m </a>to cover the cost of claims. This takes the bill for the big banks up to nearly \u00a310bn even before the updates due this week, when Lloyds is regarded as likely to need to stump up more on top of the \u00a34.3bn the episode has already cost its shareholders.</p> <p>And Barclays, again, is the bank that best illustrates the new mis-selling scandal of interest rate swaps to small businesses. It will be in court tomorrow facing claims from Guardian Care Homes that it was mis-sold \u00a370m of these swaps, which were intended to protect against rises in interest rates. The Wolverhampton care home operator claims to have lost \u00a312m.</p> <p>Barclays is not alone in facing claims over interest rate swaps: the Financial Services Authority estimates that 44,000 businesses may have been mis-sold swaps. Every bank's third-quarter numbers this week will be scrutinised for signs of additional provisions to cover new claims.</p> <p>And then there are the new scandals just lurking in the background. Santander this week took a mish-mash of a provision \u2013 of \u00a3232m, no less \u2013 to cover \"conduct remediation\" and future regulatory changes. The bank did not spell it out, but only a small part of the \u00a3232m is likely cover interest rate swaps. Some will be the cost of helping the card insurer CPP pay out redress to bank customers sold identity-theft protection. On Friday CPP admitted it had made a \u00a325m provision following an FSA investigation into the way the insurance was sold. Several banks used CPP to sell such insurance and may be forced to help cough up the compensation bill.</p> <p>Then there is the potential scandal brewing from the sale of interest-only mortgages taken out in the boom years and now described as a \u00a3100bn time-bomb, as customers may never be able to pay off the actual sums borrowed. It may not take much to tip this skeleton out of the cupboard, if customers start to complain they were not given proper advice or if the FSA decides to get heavy. In the runup to the crisis, up to a third of all mortgages were interest-only deals \u2013 a truly scary number if customers are unable to switch to a repayment mortgage when the moment comes; and <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/money/2012/oct/29/claims-firms-mortgage-mis-selling\" title=\"\">as we report</a>, the same claim firms that have helped drive PPI payouts to astronomical levels are now turning their attention to mortgage mis-selling.</p> <p>So much of the activity that has taken place in the banking industry is enough to spook even the hardiest soul. But it takes a lot to scare Bank of England executive Andy Haldane, who is due to give his views on \"socially responsible banking\" in a speech tomorrow. Perhaps he'll finally frighten bankers into behaving in a way that will not come back to haunt them.</p> <h2>Nearly time for BAE's chairman to take off</h2> <p>It would have been a stunning coup for shareholder activism \u2013 a letter from a half a dozen or more of BAE's big investors demanding the resignation of the chairman. Dick Olver would have been gone in no time.</p> <p>But that was not the epistle that arrived. Only three signatures were on the letter that landed at BAE headquarters last week. The most important was that of Neil Woodford of Invesco Perpetual, which owns 13.3% of the defence company. But Woodford had found only two minor recruits among the fund management community, and one of those, Artemis, appeared squeamish, trying and failing to keep its name out of papers.</p> <p>Still, the rebels had a plan: leak the letter and trust that more fund managers would rally to their flag in the wake of the defence group's failed attempt to merge with EADS. They didn't \u2013 or, at least, not publicly.</p> <p>Instead, the rest of the week was dominated by a strong rearguard defence of Olver from the City establishment. \"Woodford has overplayed his hand,\" said one veteran chairman. \"We are all in favour of active and engaged shareholders but Neil has to understand that he doesn't always speak for everyone. He doesn't have a majority here. Most people think Dick has done a good job.\"</p> <p>That does indeed appear to be the prevailing mood. If Olver is sufficiently determined, he might be able to stay in post until his intended retirement date of May 2014, by which time he would have served a decade as chairman.</p> <p>But would it be wise? A state of hostility and distrust for 18 months between the board of the country's largest manufacturer and the largest shareholder is unsatisfactory all round. Strategic paralysis might set in, to nobody's benefit.</p> <p>Olver's best option may be to show that he carries the support of most shareholders, which he is half way to doing, and then declare before next May's annual meeting that he will go early. After all, 10 years as chairman does feel too long \u2013 especially when the share price has mostly been falling for the past five.</p> <h2>More women in the ranks means more women at the top</h2> <p>When Cynthia Carroll announced her departure from mining firm Anglo-American on Friday \u2013 which will leave just two women at the top of FTSE 100 companies once she goes next year \u2013 she was keen to say that firms shouldn't appoint \"token\" women for the sake of it.</p> <p>But after the announcement that Pearson's long-serving boss Dame Marjorie Scardino is stepping down \u2013 and, further down the corporate food chain, that Kate Swann at WH&#xa0;Smith and Sly Bailey at Trinity Mirror are handing in their passes \u2013 it's becoming increasingly difficult to argue that we're making much progress towards better balance in the boardroom.</p> <p>While it's relatively easy to find heavyweight generalists to appoint as non-execs \u2013 and a number of women have built up a portfolio of such posts \u2013 it's harder to ensure that managers in an organisation work to nurture talented women for senior executive roles. Carroll's right that tokenism at the top helps no one: companies must also take a good look at what's going on well below board level.</p>",
  "<p>We are obsessively invited to obsess over the fine print of a debacle. As in: What precisely did Helen Boaden say to George Entwistle about Jimmy Savile at a lunch/party/coffee morning some time in November 2011? But there is also a bigger picture here \u2013 and one short, deluding word that underpins it. Trust. As in: trust in the BBC, trust in the media, trust in public life. And such trust, it becomes ever clearer, is a concept of shreds and tatters.</p> <p>Does trust matter? Not as much as we like to pretend. The <em>Sun</em>, pollsters report, is Britain's least trusted newspaper; but when it plants a pleb charge under Andrew Mitchell, the Tory chief whip implodes. The <em>Daily Mail</em> is assaulted on Twitter for claiming that Peter Rippon is \"stepping down\" as editor of <em>Newsnight</em>, a tale the BBC won't confirm. Who on earth \"trusts\" the <em>Mail</em>? Except that, the following morning, Rippon has indeed stepped into nothingness.</p> <p>It's the story that counts. It's specific exclusives and specific decisions that matter. So look \u2013 in the name of \"trust\" \u2013 at some great examples from the last three years. Is there trust in MPs and their way with expenses? No: thanks to the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, there's only a gulp of incredulity. Why did nobody notice what Jimmy Savile was doing? Because so many obvious things go bizarrely unnoticed. Among them, that hundreds of honourable members were fiddling their personal cash flows.</p> <p>Is there trust in newspapers and their journalists, then? No: thanks to the <em>Guardian</em> and phone hacking, there's very little you could call trust left standing. Is there trust in the police and the forces of law and order? No: phone-hacking investigations were an indolent, shifty shambles. The top of the Met exuded a familiar pong. Surrey police didn't exactly uncover the rot at Duncroft. Forgotten investigations of Savile got nowhere time and again. And as for Hillsborough (no thanks to the <em>Sun</em>), that was a disgrace. Thank you and, finally, good night, Sir Norman Bettison. Perhaps you fancy a few weeks at Champneys?</p> <p>Is there trust in the probity of our armed forces and the men and women who run them? Call <em>Sunday Times</em> reporters, disguised as arms company salesmen, and watch recently retired top brass scuttle to serve them in lobbying the MoD. A total trust bust.</p> <p>Trust in bankers, in financial regulators, in the mores of the City? Mutter \"Libor\" and hurry along. Trust in the no win, no fee lawyers offering to excavate old insurance policies? Trust in doctors at Stoke Mandeville in the 1970s? Trust in the Roman Catholic church of paedophilia past?</p> <p>The BBC is not alone in its present plight. On the contrary, it seems merely the latest area of our public life where the moving finger writes something completely depressing. I remember, two decades back editing a newspaper, being profoundly shocked when we uncovered the truth about MPs' cash for questions. I didn't believe such arrogant cupidity or stupidity was possible. But now? The trail of moral debris seems endless.</p> <p>Some of it is deemed to merit inordinate inquiring. Here's Leveson, toiling away, pen in hand. Here are the battalions of operations Weeting and Elveden still ploughing through News International's cupboards. Here is the BBC in disarray, launching inquiries before breakfast. But what \u2013 apart from backbench moans, groans and continuing recidivism \u2013 is there left to investigate on the parliamentary expenses front? Where are the grim commissions of inquiry destined to make Britain's policing titans flinch \u2013 or retired generals polish up their moral compasses?</p> <p>The over-arching truth about \"trust\" today is that it's a mushy nullity, mired by too much murk in too many different fields \u2013 and that it's also a taunting sort of game politicians play naturally. Trust, in BBC terms, is often a mystic replacement of market forces. Since we must all pay our licence fee willy-nilly, there has to be some suitable recompense for our \u00a3145.50. And when BBC trust drops away, like any trust in journalism itself after the hacking horror, reporters and editors in turn feel personally affronted.</p> <p>This has one signal consequence. It turns media failings into a huge media story because the media bangs on about its introversions day after day. Hacking has been bad enough for the press. But the finer points of Rippon's blogs will soon become deeply boring if all they betray is some unquantifiable failure of trust, the self-valuation of the people who work with him. Lord Patten can issue as many statements about trust as he likes, but they'll seem mere propaganda unless backed by particular stories we can all read and test.</p> <p><em>Panorama</em> on <em>Newsnight's</em> failings was a good start, and would have been even better if the team had been able to follow the story through the layers of journalism that mattered: to interview Rippon, Boaden, Entwistle and Mark Thompson. But, alas, the higher up the pay grade you found yourself, the more inclined you seemed to stay mum and hire a lawyer. That's trust \u2013 and maybe truth \u2013 deferred. That, in the case of Nick Pollard's <em>Newsnight</em> inquiry, is a simple interrogation that might have taken a week turned into months.</p> <p>Yet see how easy it is to obsess in the media village where journalists and politicians jostle for breathing space. I'm doing it myself again now. And meanwhile the bankers, the chief constables, honourable members <em>et al </em>make brief appearances on the stage of slime then vanish, trusted to carry on much as usual because the journalists who ought to be monitoring (and who in some part exposed them first time around) are navel-watching again, too concerned about trust to concentrate on earning it. It's the job we should have been doing for all those abused children three decades ago. It's the difficult job that needs doing now.</p>",
  "<p>John Carpenter's best movies are his first four or five, made between 1974 and 1980, all of them genre flicks where imagination, intelligence, wit and chutzpah were called into play by the exigencies of low budgets and short shooting schedules. The third, the hugely influential <em>Halloween</em> (made in 1978 and revived for the forthcoming trick-or-treat fest) is the ultimate refined slasher movie, a style of exploitation picture spawned by Hitchcock's <em>Psycho</em>. The opening shot, a long, virtuoso hand-held take with a subjective camera, introduces us to the five-year-old murderer Michael Myers who 15 years later escapes from the state asylum to his midwestern home town, there to don a mask and terrorise high school kids on Halloween night. His name is a tribute to the independent British distributor Michael Myers, a great Wardour Street character, who did a fine job promoting <em>Assault on Precinct 13</em>. Making her screen debut as an intrepid babysitter is future \"scream queen\" Jamie Lee Curtis, whose mother Janet Leigh played Marion Crane in <em>Psycho</em>, and Donald Pleasence is a fierce presence as the psychiatrist pursuing Myers. He's called Sam Loomis, the name of Marion Crane's boyfriend. The movie was shot in 12 days for $320,000 and took $117m worldwide. Carpenter wrote the eerie music himself, and the widescreen cinematography is by Dean Cundey, who based the night scenes on Edward Hopper's sinister painting <a href=\"http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/edward-hopper/rooms-for-tourists\" title=\"\"><em>Rooms for Tourists</em></a> with its absence of people, sharply lit facades and pitch-black night. Cundey was later to light the <em>Back to the Future</em> trilogy and <em>Jurassic Park</em>.</p>",
  "<p>One of them was born in South Africa and attended the exclusive and expensive Hilton college before coming to board at Harrow as a teenager. The other has his roots firmly planted in Sheffield.</p> <p>One of them is a 29-year-old man of the world who has scored almost 10,000 runs for two counties. The other is only 21, has made four first-class centuries, and only just passed 30 County Championship matches for Yorkshire.</p> <p>One of them has one of the most resonant surnames in British sport, never mind cricket, as his grandfather Denis made 78 Test appearances for England, as well as 60 with a bigger ball for Arsenal \u2013 and even his father, Richard, played first-class cricket for Natal. The other comes from humbler sporting stock, although his dad achieved the notable double of winning club competitions with Sheffield Collegiate at Lord's and Sheffield Tigers at Twickenham in the space of a few months in 2000.</p> <p>It is irresistible to talk up the contrast between the two candidates to open the batting with the new Test captain, Alastair Cook, when England begin the post-Strauss era this week. Yet it may also be a little misleading. Certainly, Nick Compton has had to graft for this first senior call-up, however privileged his background. And Joe Root did not exactly emerge from a mineshaft with flat cap and whippet, having grown up in Sheffield's prosperous suburbs and crossed the Nottinghamshire border to attend fee-paying Worksop college in the sixth form \u2013 a couple of years after Samit Patel, another member of this England tour squad, had left.</p> <p>Richard Ibbotson, the chairman of Root's Collegiate club who also watched Michael Vaughan rise through the junior ranks a couple of decades ago, came within an injury of getting to know Compton much better the winter before last, as the pair were due to link up on an MCC trip to Japan and Indonesia. \"I was player-manager, and Nick was supposed to be my captain,\" Ibbotson explained. \"We had a couple of chats on the phone but then it turned out he needed an operation, so he had to pull out and was replaced by Keith Medlycott.\"</p> <p>That small coincidence shows that, in some ways, Compton's rise to England contention has been as rapid as Root's \u2013 it has just come much later in his career. It's an intriguing story, too, as it has come as the result of a close working relationship with Neil Burns, the former Somerset and Leicestershire wicket keeper.</p> <p>He had moved into mentoring and mind-coaching after his retirement in 2001, reforming the London County Cricket Club \u2013 for whom in 1904 WG Grace scored the last of his 126 first-class centuries \u2013 to work on the theories he had developed during his playing career. After enjoying early success in helping to revive the career of Darren Stevens, who has since given such good value to Kent, Burns was put in touch with Compton by Gordon Lord, the England and Wales Cricket Board's head of elite coach development.</p> <p>\"Nick was having a really tough time,\" Burns recalls. \"He was only 20, and he wasn't sure if his contract with Middlesex was going to be renewed. Our relationship built slowly \u2013 we worked hard in the winter of 2005-06, when he came out to my academy in Cape Town. He then had a fantastic 2006 season, made an England A tour, and came back and opened the batting with Alastair Cook for the MCC against Sussex, the champion county.\"</p> <p>A good omen for Ahmedabad? Perhaps not. \"He nicked off for nought,\" Burns adds. \"I agreed to support him from arm's length, but Nick went through a difficult spell after that. KP was all the rage, there were lots of eye-catching players out there and that became a distraction from the signature strokes he had.\" At the end of the 2009 season, Burns helped to steer Compton to Somerset, one of his old counties.</p> <p>\"Sometimes you need that fresh start, so that people perceive you as you are today not how you used to be,\" the mentor explains. \"I thought Nick was capable of being a high achiever in cricket, with leadership potential and capable of being a Test match batsman. It was a little bit now or never.\"</p> <p>The runs began to flow more freely in Somerset \u2013 1,010 at 56 in the Championship in 2011 \u2013 but last winter Burns and Compton refocused, deliberately and strategically. \"I thought there was a niche in the market for what I call proper batting,\" he adds. \"Nick had the capability for that, so that's where the work needed to go. That's the great thing about him, his willingness to work so hard: to do his training with Somerset, then drive two hours to me at Ascot and do some more.\"</p> <p>That work was often unorthodox: Burns talks of cranking the bowling machine up to full pace and turning off the lights, as well as t'ai chi, meditation and Bikram yoga at 40C. But most importantly, \"hitting an incredible number of balls for hours at a time \u2013 the whole point being to create conditions far beyond what he was going to face in the middle\".</p> <p>\"The challenge we set him technically was to develop the best forward defensive in world cricket, the best backward defensive in world cricket, to become the most judicious leaver on fourth and fifth stump,\" Burns continues. \"We refocused goals, so instead of thinking in terms of scoring runs, it was about how many balls you faced.\"</p> <p>The results were impressive \u2013 only some badly timed Worcester drizzle denied Compton the chance to become the first batsman since Graeme Hick to score 1,000 first-class runs by the end of May. Now he has the shot at establishing himself in Test cricket that he and Burns have coveted for years. Will England plump for his experience alongside Cook at the top of the order, or give Root the chance to establish himself for years to come? The team selection for the opening tour match, against India A, which starts in Mumbai on Tuesday, will provide the first clue.</p>",
  "<p>When Lord Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong and the man appointed by the government to monitor the behaviour of the BBC, sat down to lunch with journalists three weeks ago, he waved away the plate of food he was offered with a grim face. \"I didn't think I'd come here to eat,\" he said. The business of the day was too serious. Sir Jimmy Savile, it was now clear, had been guilty of a chain of sexual crimes during his years as a BBC star and no one at the corporation had done anything about it. What's more, key information about the crimes had been kept back from the public for almost a year.</p> <p>Yet Patten, a veteran political heavyweight, was in confident mood. He scorned any suggestion that a <em>Newsnight </em>investigation into Savile had been suppressed and argued that the BBC's failure to report the presenter's abuse was mirrored by the laxity of the press. The whole affair was \"a cesspit\", but one he felt he was viewing from a safe distance.</p> <p>This weekend both he and his director general, George Entwistle, are sitting amid what Patten has since described as \"a tsunami of filth\". Far from separating the BBC from the criminal activities of a dead paedophile, the revelations about Savile contained in ITV's <em>Exposure</em> documentary on 3 October, and in the BBC's subsequent episode of <em>Panorama</em>, have lifted the lid on a publicly funded broadcaster ruled by fear and caution to the point of dysfunction.</p> <p>Twenty days later Patten has now exchanged terse letters with the culture minister, Maria Miller, who has questioned the soundness of BBC governance. A shadow of doubt also hangs over the future of Entwistle and his news chiefs, while <em>Newsnight</em> editor Peter Rippon has \"stepped aside\" after giving a flawed account of his team's work in a semi-official blog posting. The dark cloud has even spread across the Atlantic, where the BBC's former DG, Mark Thompson, who was in charge while <em>Newsnight</em> was pursuing its investigation, is about to take up a well-paid job as CEO of the <em>New York Times</em>.</p> <p>So the confident stance of that lunch on 10 October has gone. On Thursday Patten gave a series of TV interviews in which he accepted that he and other BBC chiefs had put out \"misleading\" information. \"What I signed up to is a blog which didn't turn out to be absolutely accurate,\" he said.</p> <p>It is bad luck that this scandal broke only 11 days into Entwistle's new job. The fact remains, though, that the toxicity of the Savile revelations has grown because of exactly the hierarchical \"silo mentality\" inside the organisation that Entwistle and Patten had both promised to tackle.</p> <p>Sir Michael Lyons, chairman of the BBC Trust until Patten took over in April last year, argues that concern about the BBC's behaviour is distracting from the key issues raised by Savile's offences: \"Why do we allow powerful men and powerful celebrities to behave like this? I don't think I heard the name of Jimmy Savile when I was at the BBC, nor any allegations. He was just a bit of history,\" he said.</p> <p>But Lyons had warned in May that the trust needed to search outside the BBC for a successor to Thompson. His comments underscored a belief that there had been a failure to plan a proper succession and Entwistle had not been given enough time to develop into a public figure. Shortly afterwards Entwistle failed to respond publicly to the outcry over the botched BBC coverage of the jubilee river pageant, though he went on to win Patten's backing as director general, beating Caroline Thomson, chief operating officer of the BBC.</p> <p>Naturally enough, public interest in how the BBC Trust works as an in-house regulator is limited \u2013 and the DG's job security is not the stuff of conversation in the bus queue. But the issue of prolonged sexual abuse on BBC premises, however historic, is of great public concern. More than five million people stayed up to watch <em>Panorama</em> last Monday. Such high ratings are shaming when it is probable that if ITV had not taken up the Savile story it would still be filed away in <em>Newsnight</em>'s drawer. Most damaging of all, according to many of those inside the BBC, the slow corporate response has revealed a lumbering management structure where commonsense inquiries about the work of other departments are discouraged. These factors mean the <em>Newsnight </em>debacle now sits beside other great BBC dramas. These, notably, are 28 January 1987, the day Marmaduke Hussey, new chairman of the BBC, ruthlessly dismissed his DG, Alasdair Milne. His move followed long-standing tensions between the BBC and the Thatcher government, culminating in Special Branch raiding BBC Scotland. John Birt was hired to impose a radical restructuring of news and current affairs.</p> <p>Then, in January 2004 Greg Dyke was forced out of the BBC when chairman Gavyn Davies resigned over the criticisms of Andrew Gilligan's report debunking government claims about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Queengate followed, when edited footage in a programme trailer falsely showed Her Majesty throwing a strop, then in 2008 Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand made lewd jokes at the expense of actor Andrew Sachs and his granddaughter. Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas resigned within days and the notorious \"programme compliance\" rules were strengthened.</p> <p>At least one former top BBC television executive believes these crises have left a dangerous legacy of caution and defensive behaviour. \"People increasingly make decisions based on making as few waves as possible,\" he said.</p> <p>Before internal inquiries report, three crucial mistakes remain evident to outsiders. First, Savile tribute programmes were broadcast at Christmas when the corporation already had testimony that he was a serial sex offender. Second, evidence of historic offences carried out at the BBC was not handed over to the police, delaying the current investigation by almost a year. Certainly, some sources say, senior figures knew details \u2013 perhaps Steve Mitchell, the deputy director of news and Helen Boaden, director of BBC News. Third, the BBC appears to have hesitated before putting out an accurate version of events that had been misrepresented in Rippon's original blog about the dropping of his team's investigation. It was posted online on 2 October, after he had shown it to Mitchell. Yet, although it seems that producer Meirion Jones had pointed out its errors immediately, it was corrected only on 22 October. This meant the BBC chairman and other executives, including Entwistle, were relying on faulty information. It also provoked the culture secretary's interventions last week.</p> <p>According to Simon Albury, retiring chief executive of the Royal Television Society, the BBC is mired in its \"worst ever crisis\" that \"calls into question the BBC Trust as its governance structure\". The former <em>World in Action</em> journalist has run the industry body for 12 years with discretion. Now free to speak, he said: \"Lord Patten appeared foolish. He's not a foolish man, so it must be because he's chairman of an organisation that has been tested and cannot work.\"</p> <p>Albury went on to say that an independent inquiry should have been announced straight away, instead of waiting for the all-clear from the police. \"The BBC Trust is like a carnival horse, facing in two directions at the same time, and it has failed,\" he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a leading TV executive in the independent sector and a leading BBC presenter both argue that Patten is too close to Entwistle, one even going so far as to say that the DG is \"Patten's creature\". Others, including a former BBC executive, suspect that Entwistle and Patten's jobs are both safe because the crisis has occurred so early in the DG's tenure. Patten's cheerleading for the BBC, this observer feels, is welcome in such a beleaguered corporation.</p> <p>Internally, the crisis has clearly created rival factions, with household names quietly lining up behind Rippon, Boaden or Entwistle. Those who support Boaden say she \"will not fall on her sword\" and did everything she could to alert the DG to the dangers of the Savile tributes, given strict BBC conventions about not trespassing on the realm of fellow managers. Boaden herself has said Rippon's standing aside \"does not reflect on his journalism\". Defenders of Rippon point out that the case against Savile remained sketchy before Christmas. The BBC inquiry may glean more from <em>Newsnight</em> reporter Liz MacKean's email about her editor's \"latest panic attack\" and his fear that the Savile investigation would involve a \"long political chain\" of executives. Others who have worked for <em>Newsnight</em> now cast aspersions on Rippon's track record, suggesting he had been brought in from radio and \"was not up to the <em>Newsnight</em> role\". Most publicly, 5 Live's Victoria Derbyshire has tweeted her concerns, asking on Twitter: \"If BBC journos/Eds make a poor editorial call, (&amp; most of us hve at some point), will they be treated by mgemnt like Peter Rippon has been?\".</p> <p>Former BBC executive Jane Root, the first woman to control a BBC channel, suspects the <em>Newsnight</em> editor was worried about the tone of the investigation. \"I suspect there may have been a feeling too that it was not quite right for <em>Newsnight</em>; a bit sleazy and all about a dead old celebrity. What I wonder is why the information they had was not passed on to <em>Panorama</em> before now,\" she said.</p> <p>John Bridcut, an ex-<em>Newsnight</em> executive, who conducted an impartiality report for the BBC across the range programmesin 2007, said that, while Rippon had \"made a poor decision and editors had to stand or fall by them\", he feels sorry for him. \"He is being hung out to dry. He's been made the complete fall guy, when the bigger story is what on earth was going on back then in Light Entertainment. Helen Boaden was also entirely proper in saying that the Savile investigation should not scrimp on journalistic standards.\"</p> <p>Like others still inside the BBC, Bridcut adds that if the corporation had accused Savile and been shown to be wrong \"all hell would have broken loose about how they were trashing the reputation of a wonderful philanthropist \u2013 in fact, the complete obverse of what is happening now.\"</p> <p>One <em>Newsnight</em> insider blames the lame response to the crisis on the BBC's rigid and \"lethal\" hierarchy, modelled, he says, on the principle that the more senior a person is, the more reliable they are. This led Patten and Entwistle to issue inaccurate statements as the scandal unfolded.</p> <p>The same \"top down\" culture seems to have prevented heads of Light Entertainment in the 1970s and 1980s from acting to stop Savile. All those contacted say they knew nothing, perhaps for fear of moral and legal culpability. Despite earlier references to Savile's illegal activities in a Louis Theroux documentary, in the cult comedy of standup Jerry Sadowitz, and in the <em>Sunday Mirror</em> and the <em>Oldie</em> magazine earlier this year, current leading executives also claim to have known nothing until newspaper reports heralded the ITV <em>Exposure </em>documentary this autumn.</p> <p>So a 10-second exchange between Boaden and Entwistle at an awards ceremony on 2 December last year, in which she warned him about Savile, does not seem to have piqued the future DG's interest. This is either because he was keeping a disciplined distance, or because he knew the rumours and did not need to ask. He told a parliamentary select committee last week that it was the former: \"I absolutely did not want to do anything that demonstrated excessive interest.\"</p> <p>Senior BBC sources have told this newspaper it is \"inconceivable\" that Entwistle and the then DG, Thompson, did not learn of, or read, detailed press coverage in January and February. Nevertheless, Patten also told a radio interviewer last week that he had not seen any reports in his press cuttings.</p> <p>The latest unseemly episode in this fiasco saw three key players shouting at each other in a BBC newsroom last Wednesday. After appearing on Radio 4's <em>Media Show</em> to apologise for misleading the public, the BBC's head of editorial policy, David Jordan, bumped into Jones and Rippon. Accusations flew, with Jordan alleging that Jones had behaved despicably, and the producer saying Jordan had lied for the BBC. Rippon, say witnesses, then tried to get Jordan to apologise. On air, an embarrassed Jordan had discovered that Jones had revealed the existence of a confidential meeting between the two on 5 October about Rippon's blog.</p> <p>Resemblance to farce does not end there. Far from disbanding its \"silo mentality\", since 17 October the BBC has put up a series of Chinese walls to prevent staff involved with the Savile inquiry from reporting on the issue. Those \"recused\" include Entwistle, Boaden, Mitchell and Rippon, who has been forced to stand down. In an unprecedented move, untainted executives have been moved in \u2013 Tim Davie, deputising for Entwistle, Peter Horrocks, the head of World Service, for Helen Boaden, and Fran Unsworth, head of newsgathering, for Mitchell.</p> <p>So the ironic result of problems caused by a lack of communication is that extra obstacles have been erected. Patten, who was at the centre of one famous tearful farewell when he handed Hong Kong over to Chinese authority, could soon preside over another set of emotional departures.</p>",
  "<p>\"If we win Virginia, we will win this election,\" President Barack Obama <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/08/obamas-key-to-victory-virginia/1\">told a cheering crowd in Leesburg</a>, in the north of the state, in August.</p> <p>Old Dominion, as Virginia is known, was one of the states Obama wrested from the Republicans in 2008, beating John McCain by six points as he swept to power. This time, his campaign knows it will be closer.</p> <p>Until recently the president held a slender lead over Mitt Romney here, but with the latter's recent resurgence, <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-virginia-president-romney-vs-obama\">the two appear to be neck-and-neck</a>. One of the keys to Obama's victory here in 2008, as in so many other states, was the lead he amassed among young voters, who turned out in huge numbers four years ago.</p> <p>The question now is whether he can count on them again.</p> <p>\"I voted for Obama last time because he seemed pretty inspirational, he's obviously a great talker and has a lot of charisma. But this year I have no clue who I'm going to vote for. I have no clue if I'm even going to vote.\"</p> <p>Amanda Ravan has been affected more than most by the economic downturn. Her father lost the job he had held for 25 years during the dying days of the Bush administration. He found work again in 2008, but hundreds of miles away, in South Carolina. He and her mother decided to move.</p> <p>\"I don't get to see them as often as I'd like,\" Ravan said. \"Maybe three or four times a year.\" The 25-year-old now lives with her grandmother in Mechanics Ville, 30 minutes drive east of Richmond. She works as a parking valet in Richmond at night and is attending Virginia Commonwealth University by day \u2013 hoping to become a kindergarten teacher.</p> <p>\"The jobs situation isn't great,\" she said. \"And the economy doesn't look like it's improved much. But it's hard with the opposite party stopping him.\"</p> <p>Ravan said she would watch the remaining presidential debates, which she said could potentially influence her decision, but she has become disillusioned since 2008. It's exactly the sort of story Obama and his campaign do not want to hear, but her apathy appears to be mirrored by some of the election polling.</p> <p>Just before the election four years ago, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2008/PPP_Release_Virginia_1102.pdf\">Gallup polling of likely voters</a> showed 15% of those planning to cast their vote were in the 18-29 age group. The organisation's <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/obama-up-3-in-virginia.html#\">polling this time shows</a> that group making up just 12% of the electorate \u2013 a significant decrease.</p> <p>Young voters coming out in smaller numbers is more of a problem for Obama because he gets so much more support among that group. Americans aged between 18-29 voted almost 2 to 1 for Obama four years ago, as the Hope and Change message \u2013 plus the intense network of grassroots campaigning \u2013 won hearts and minds. While young people seem likely to vote in smaller numbers, some say they may also show less support for the president.</p> <p>\"Obama will still win the 18-29 vote,\" said Geoffrey Skelley, from the University of Virginia's center for politics. \"But the question is really does he get closer nationally to the two-thirds he got of them in 2008, or is he only at around 60% this time?\"</p> <p>Skelley said he \"would expect a drop off\" this time round. As well as a faltering economy, young people face much higher unemployment rates than the national average, meaning they feel the pinch more than other voters. Romney will not win the group, but he could tighten the gap.</p> <p>\"I'm voting for Romney,\" said Mallory Pellicane, a 22-year-old nurse from Richmond. \"For lots of different reasons. I haven't seen much from Obama over the last four years.\" Pellicane, who said she comes from a Republican family, voted for McCain in 2008, but said it was not just the family's honour that is guiding her vote. \"I really haven't seen any change at all,\" Pellicane said when asked about Obama's first term. \"He really hasn't done anything that I can look at and appreciate.\"</p> <p>As for the president's opponent: \"I just feel like I trust Romney. I feel like he really cares about people. And certain stories I've read about him I just really like,\" Pellicane said. \"I am going to be one of the first people there to vote. I am very anxious to vote for him.\"</p> <p>Some 70 miles west of Richmond is Charlottesville, home to one of America's top public universities. The University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson after his own eight-year spell as president at the turn of the 19th century. The third president of the United States left his stamp on much of the university's architecture, with gleaming white columns and domes flanking the famous Academical Lawn. The leaves were just beginning to fall in early October, as students began to re-immerse themselves into the academic year.</p> <p>\"Obama,\" said Kerri Murphy, a Spanish and environmental science student, when asked who she would vote for in November. \"Generally I care more about social issues than fiscal issues. It's difficult for me to vote for Romney and Ryan as a woman.\"</p> <p>While Obama has done some \"not so great things\" in the last four years, Murphy, 21, said there was no danger of her voting Republican. \"There could be two very different Americas depending on who gets elected.\"</p> <p>Murphy is illustrative of one of the serious problems Romney and the Republican party at large have with winning young voters: on basic social issues they simply do not match up. On the traditional Democrat stomping ground of a university campus the Guardian spoke to a number of voters who might not be considered die-hard Obama supporters, but felt turned off by Romney.</p> <p>\"I'm voting for Obama mostly because I believe in Democratic ideals. I'm pro-choice, pro-gay marriage,\" said 19-year-old Laura Biver, a biology student originally from Alexandria, Virginia. \"I don't particularly love Obama, but I like him better than Romney. And I like the ideas he stands for more.\"</p> <p>Travelling further south though, it became apparent that not every young Obama voter was casting their ballot simply as a way to keep Romney at bay.</p> <p>Alvin Mosley grew up in the tiny town of Appomattox, named after the Appomattocs Native American tribe who dwelt there in the 17th century. Moseley, now 23, enrolled in the Marines in 2007, but left the military last year and initially struggled to find work.</p> <p>\"In the debate Mitt Romney was talking about how the higher people, like the millionaires, pay less taxes and I don't think that's fair,\" Moseley said. \"I'm going to vote for Barack Obama. He's trying to keep the healthcare for people who can't afford healthcare. And also on top of that he's trying to make it faster for veterans to get their disability.\"</p> <p>Mosley toured Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and Jordan while in the Marines, but became unemployed when he moved home. Mosley is a voter who can point to specific instances of how he has benefited from Obama's presidency, and is enthusiastic about voting. When out of work he was able to sign onto his mother's healthcare policy, as a result of the Affordable Healthcare Act, which allows people to stay on their parent's plans up to the age of 26.</p> <p>The 23-year-old now travels to work in Lynchburg, Virginia, a small city nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The city is built on a hill, with steep streets running through the downtown area, at points allowing commanding views of the dense woodland stretching away to the south.</p> <p>Down in the centre of Lynchburg, deserted when the Guardian stopped by on a Wednesday afternoon, a smattering of cafes and restaurants cater for downtown businesses. Shelli Monahan, 26, grew up in New Jersey, but moved to Lynchberg three years ago \u2013 \"because it's cheaper to live\". Monahan, who has two young children, works in a downtown cafe but plans to go to college.</p> <p>\"Without an education you can't make it [in New Jersey]. So I planned to move here, go to school \u2013 and now still not move back because it's still too expensive,\" she said.</p> <p>Monahan said she will vote for Obama in November. Like the young women voters in Charlottesville, she was mindful of where Romney and the Republicans stand on women's rights. \"[Republicans] think it's awful for a woman to expect birth control to be paid for by her health insurance,\" she said. \"I mean that's just ridiculous. Women's rights, being a woman, I take that very seriously. Definitely women's equality is a big thing.\"</p> <p>But Monahan is not just casting a vote against Romney. Like Mosley, she could also point to instances where Obama's presidency had \"definitely\" impacted her life, in her case through Obama increasing the funding for Pell grants. This positive impact is the main reason he will get her vote.</p> <p>\"He's for education. He wants to give everybody equal opportunity to get healthcare. My boyfriend is currently going to school for free on one of his grants, which is excellent.</p> <p>\"No matter if you're rich or poor everybody should have equal opportunity to go to school, to get healthcare.</p> <p>\"We should be treated equally.\"</p>",
  "<p>On 1 August 2012, an early morning phone call left me stunned and numb. One of the most amazing women I have ever worked with, who has dedicated decades of her life to working with young people in the inner city, lost her son. He had been stabbed through the heart three days after his 16th birthday in an unprovoked attack. I could barely believe what I was being told. I felt physically sick; I couldn't hold it together. A few days later, we held a service for peace at a church in Peckham to pray for the community. Courageously, through tears of pain, she came and joined many others who had lost their children in similar circumstances.</p> <p>After the riots of 2011, we were told that one in five of the rioters was part of a gang. As a result, the government declared an \"all-out war on gangs\". Despite the home secretary acknowledging that \"we can't arrest our way out of the [gang] problem\", new laws that gave police additional powers were passed and the government seemed to begin trying to do just that. Recent political rhetoric and reports of 1,500 gang-related arrests by Operation Trident have sought to persuade us that we are making real progress on \"the gangs problem\". However, it is naive to think that tactical enforcement alone will solve the complex causes of violence and stop young people from leaving school and joining gangs.</p> <p>Even when gang members are in prison, they are not removed from gang culture. My heart sank when a prison chaplain recently told me that there were 35 gangs operating inside a young offenders institution I was visiting and that they communicated regularly with gang members outside. Many had to eat alone in their cells to keep gang members apart. Those who break the law must face the consequences of their actions, but let's not delude ourselves that current policy is making a sustainable impact upon gangs. Far from it. When gang members are imprisoned, a vacuum is created for younger members to step into their shoes, causing an escalation in violence as they vie for position.</p> <p>Has anything really changed over the past year? The answer is \"no\". We have kids attending some of our projects wearing stab-proof vests because they live in such fear of attack. You can quote all the reports you like telling me 'it's getting better', but gangs are still there and people are still being seriously wounded and are dying. I still meet mothers grieving and utterly inconsolable at the deaths of their children. But these days such loss of life seems to attract far less attention from the media and politicians.</p> <p>The vain hope that police can sort out gangs on their own, and the positive diversion of the Olympics this summer, has resulted in us losing focus on what is really required. These young men and women are not born angry, as violent gang members. Family breakdown, poverty, poor housing, addiction, educational failure, crime, violence and unemployment create gang members. The prime minister recently rightly called for \"tough but intelligent justice\". I would call for equally \"tough and intelligent engagement\" that deals with these root issues, offers positive relationships and role-models, and provides alternatives that lead to a long-term, sustainable answer to gangs.</p> <p><em>Patrick Regan is the founder of youth engagement charity XLP and the author of Fighting Chance: Tackling Britain's Gang Culture</em></p>",
  "<p>Junior Smart knows a lot about gangs. He speaks with such passion and elegance about the forces that sustain them that conversation with him quickly sweeps you away into another world. He is now 36 and his life can be divided into two distinct phases. He tells how in his late teens, after his mother died, he became drawn into a south London gang which, at the time, helped fill a huge vacuum.</p> <p>\"They became my new support group,\" he says. \"At first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious, more and more about making money. They got involved in criminality. That is how it was.\" At school Smart failed his GCSEs, then retook them at college and passed the lot. He secured a full-time job in administration and worked as a DJ. But, on the side, he was making money illegally as part of the gang.</p> <p>Eventually he was arrested for serious drug-related offences and was sent to prison for 12 years. Instantly, he says, his sense of invincibility was shattered. \"The first night after I was arrested was the biggest wake-up call of my life,\" he says. \"I had been living a dual life. I had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers' enemies. I spent a long time ironing myself out. I think of it like taking a shirt out of the tumble dryer and you have to iron every single one of those creases out.\"</p> <p>Today, Junior Smart runs a team of 12 full-time workers and six volunteers called the Southwark Offenders Support, which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime. Most of those working there, at the St Giles Trust in Camberwell, are, like Smart himself, ex-offenders. A few are still serving their sentences but are regarded as having reformed enough to be allowed out during the day to help. They work with the police, the probation service and other voluntary organisations to help those who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs that operate across London.</p> <p>For Smart, the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he witnessed from within a prison system that was so obviously failing its inmates. He recalls a drug addict he befriended who, to his dismay, kept returning. \"I was touched by the people who kept coming back in,\" he says. \"I couldn't believe that nothing was being done about it. I was talking to the inmates and they knew what needed to be changed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the 'index' offence.</p> <p>\"So you can be an alcoholic and you commit a robbery, so the system will treat you just for the robbery. So one guy had a \u00a3300-a-week cocaine habit which he funded through burglary. He would tell me stuff about how he would walk into a house, even when he knew people were there. So although he had a drug addiction, it never got dealt with. The thing that got me about that is that it is simply a revolving door.\"</p> <p>The same individual eventually did get drug treatment, but it was not followed through after his release. He ended up beating up his pregnant girlfriend, an offence for which he was returned to prison yet again for another stint in the cells with Smart. \"I didn't even ask him if she lost the baby or not,\" said Smart.</p> <p>That case and scores of others persuaded Smart to start working as a prison \"listener\" \u2013 an inmate who, under a scheme set up by the Samaritans, helps reassure new arrivals and talks them through their first days inside. From there he developed what he calls his own \"little plan\" to run his own scheme once out of prison \u2013 using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life. Even before he was released early, after five years, Smart was given a job at St Giles after impressing the authorities with his dedication and vision. \"At the end of my sentence I got an opportunity to put my little model into practice,\" he says, recalling the key dates precisely. \"I got the job on 26 August 2006, and I was released on 2 October.\"</p> <p>So what does he think now? Does he believe that after the riots of last August, and the government's promise to crack down on gangs, things are getting better? He is careful to offer some praise to the police and says much of their work in hauling in gang members has been good. But overall he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that he says pins too much on a belief that, once the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved.</p> <p>He agrees with the findings of a report by the Centre for Social Justice which says the arrest of gang leaders \u2013 if not followed up by far wider and deeper work to identify other ranks and prevent recruitment, coupled with more concentration on tackling poverty and deprivation \u2013 can even make things worse. He says the effect of taking out the leader is often to destabilise the entire gang.</p> <p>He draws a diagram of the hierarchy on a pad. \"When you arrest the top guy, people start fighting for position all the way up. Who was the most loyal? Who had the most respect? It is a bit like a family. They are more likely to act out, through violence. It means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a long-term effect. They have not even given the community a respite.\"</p> <p>Can it actually make the streets more dangerous? \"It can do, because in the vacuum the recruitment and manipulation of young people becomes even more prevalent, creating new lower levels all the way down. Gangs can become fractured. People take sides. If one gang or another territorial street network knows that an elder [leader] has been taken out, then they suddenly think that gang's weak, 'we can take them'. And so we have inter-estate disputes going on. And what happens when that elder is in prison? He forms alliances with other gang members, or when he gets released he then tries to retake control. That is when violence happens.\"</p> <p>In order to disseminate risk down to the lowest levels, he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools. The youngest members are called \"tinies\". \"Over the last years we have seen more and more of this. The tinies can be as young as eight to 11 years old.\" The young are brought in to shield their seniors from risk. It is often they who are charged with doing the street dealing or even the stabbing, he says.</p> <p>Smart says that, with a lack of government funding and commitment to long-term rehabilitation, the challenges are immense, particularly in the current economic climate. \"I try to engage a young person who has been earning \u00a3300 a week through illegal methods. It was hard before, to try to convince him. But with unemployment high and cuts to benefits, it makes things tougher.\"</p> <p>That said, his project, which has well over 1,000 clients, is delivering results. Fewer than 20% of those who come in for help reoffend. From personal experience, Smart refuses to write off a single individual as beyond redemption and that is what drives him on. \"I don't think that about anybody,\" he says.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's declaration of war on \"gang culture\" after the 2011 riots is branded a failure in a report that says the police's focus on arresting gang leaders while failing to act against other members has backfired.</p> <p>The study also accuses ministers of \"losing commitment\" to the fight, allowing more and more primary schoolchildren to be drawn into gangs, with some now wearing gang \"colours\" to lessons. The report by the Centre for Social Justice, an independent thinktank established by the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, and obtained by the <em>Observer</em> in advance of publication on Monday, cites professionals as saying the arrests by police of about 200 gang leaders since the riots have led to more violence rather than less.</p> <p>The CSJ says this is because the arrests have caused vacuums, in which more volatile gang members compete for power \u2013 and that arresting leaders has not been followed by action against the junior gang members who remain.</p> <p>It also cites frontline organisations and charities as reporting an increase in the number of girls being recruited into gangs and an increase in intra-gang sexual violence, as organisers seek to spread their influence. Entitled<em> Time to Wake Up:</em> <em>Tackling Gangs One Year After the Riots</em>, the report is particularly explosive because Duncan Smith is one of the cabinet ministers charged with spearheading government responses to the riots.</p> <p>After the riots, Cameron said there would be an \"all-out war on gangs and gang culture\", led by the home secretary, Theresa May, and Duncan Smith. \"It is a major criminal disease that has infected streets and estates across our country,\" he said. Policy initiatives on prevention, punishment and support were announced.</p> <p>May said in November 2011 that \"gang and youth violence is not a problem that can be solved by enforcement alone. We need to change the life stories of young people currently ending up dead or wounded on our streets or locked in a cycle of reoffending.\"</p> <p>However, the CSJ says: \"Many in Whitehall regard the riots as a random one-off, and mistake the quashing of the disorder as control of the streets. They could not be more wrong. The alarming fact is that many streets across the country are besieged by anarchy and violence. There is no control in such neighbourhoods.\"</p> <p>Christian Guy, managing director of the CSJ, says: \"Gangs played a significant role in the riots and it is dangerous to pretend otherwise. In London at least one in five of those convicted was part of a gang.\"</p> <p>The report says people it spoke to on the frontline reported a \"marked increase in the violent behaviour of some gangs. The removal of 'elders' [leaders] by the police was cited as integral to this development; preceding elders were described as having a 'code' in which certain acts \u2013 such as shooting a rival gang member when accompanied by his mother \u2013 were understood to be unacceptable and not committed.</p> <p>\"There was a consensus that the current gangs neither have such a code nor cohesive leadership, which is resulting in increased chaos, violence and anarchy.\"</p> <p>The Home Office, although presented with the main findings of the report, said it could not comment in detail on a study it had not seen in full. But a spokesman reiterated the series of announcements made by ministers last year. These included establishing an Ending Gang and Youth Violence Team and the allocation of \u00a310m of Home Office funding for this year and next to support up to 30 local areas to help \"identify, assess and work with the young people most at risk of serious violence\".</p> <p>The CSJ report recommends a number of approaches, including: \"working with children and young people already involved in gangs, but also addressing the drivers of gang culture, not just the symptoms. The surest way of eliminating gangs is to try to ensure that children and young people never want or feel the need to join them. To do this we need to tackle deeper issues in our society and seek to nurture and support ever strong families and stronger communities.\"</p> <p>The CSJ's views are echoed by Junior Smart, an ex-offender and former London gang member, who is leading a major project in south London that works to wean young people off crime and violence. \"People take sides. If one gang or another territorial street network knows that an elder has been taken out, then they suddenly think that gang is weak, 'We can take them'. And so we have inter-estate disputes going on.\"</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"There are no quick fixes, but we are seeing results. The Crime Survey for England and Wales shows that crime is down by 6%, and police figures show knife crime is down by 9%.\"</p> <p>The Metropolitan police said that since Trident Gang Crime Command was set up in February as a dedicated unit to tackle gang crime, the results had been impressive. By September overall serious youth violence was down by 34%, equating to 1,000 fewer victims.</p>",
  "<p>In the pouring rain in the middle of a Suffolk wood, Mike Ryder pats the trunk of a dripping ash, bending and snapping its branches to show how a slow death is creeping through the tree.</p> <p>\"They might want us to fell it, or burn it where it stands. We don't know what will happen, we're just waiting to be told,\" he said. \"It's frustrating and you feel quite helpless. It's just about watching it happening: there's nothing you can do. This is all ancient woodland around here and ash is the most dominant species \u2013 around 40% is ash. So it's going to change the landscape beyond recognition, that's for sure.\"</p> <p>Ryder, the Woodland Trust's forestry manager for Norfolk and Suffolk, said the discovery of \"ash dieback\" in Britain was a wake-up call for tighter restrictions on the importing of plants. \"There's been a wave of new pests and pathogens and they are slipping through our borders only too easily.\"</p> <p>This weekend Forestry Commission officials have found more than 20 sites in East Anglia where ash trees are now infected with the <em>Chalara fraxinea </em>fungus, which causes ash dieback. The UK is now braced to lose the vast majority of its 80 million ash trees, a native species which accounts for up to 30% of tree cover and hedgerows.</p> <p>The disaster facing the ash tree is a warning that Britain needs to tighten its biosecurity, say campaigners who criticise what they claim is a \"far too little too late\" response from the government.</p> <p>But Joan Webber, principal pathologist at the Forestry Commission's forest research centre, said there had been a great deal of ambiguity around ash dieback. \"How it works \u2013 how its spores travel \u2013 are all still things just emerging from research. I'm pretty sceptical about the distance it can travel airborne, for example. Hindsight is a great thing, but the fact is this is a very new and complicated situation.\"</p> <p>The president of the Country Land and Business Association, Harry Cotterell, said Britain faced a tragedy. The ash was \"one of our iconic native species\", second only to the oak as the best-known tree in the British countryside, he said, adding: \"If the ash stock in the countryside is devastated, it will be a national tragedy.</p> <p>\"I think this is a call to arms for the [whole] country \u2013 because they demonstrated, when the forest selloff was proposed, that they really love their woodland, and this is a really huge threat.\"</p> <p>Cotterell criticised the government for not issuing earlier warnings about the disease. \"It's a great pity that we weren't told about it until two or three weeks ago, whereas it clearly had been discovered in nursery stock and young trees in the spring. I think we could have started looking for it \u2013 the real concern is to find out the true extent of it.\"</p> <p>Ash dieback was first identified in the UK in February, in young plantings and nursery stock. Ryder at the Woodland Trust said he found the disease in mature native woodland in August. But it was only last Wednesday that official confirmation came from the government that the disease had spread beyond plantations and nurseries into Norfolk and Suffolk's mature trees. On Thursday the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, told the Commons that a ban on imports would start tomorrow.</p> <p>He defended the government by suggesting the outbreak in East Anglia could have resulted from spores being carried naturally into the UK. \"I think the real concern is that, geographically, it looks like the disease may have arrived into the wild on the wind,\" he said.</p> <p>Previously the fungus had only been thought to have been able to travel around 20km, but its appearance on the east coast may suggest otherwise.</p> <p>Paterson denied that the government had acted slowly since the disease was first detected in the UK in February, pointing out that more than 1,000 sites had already been checked and 50,000 young trees burned.</p> <p>But Jim Pratt, a retired Forestry Commission expert, said the authorities had been ignoring years of warnings before that, and that a ban on imports should have been made earlier. As a result, the government may be left open to compensation claims, he added.</p> <p>Pratt believes that a scaling-up of the response to ash dieback is urgent. He has called for plans to be made for the felling and storage of diseased ash.</p> <p>\"The unpalatable truth is that some large sums of money are needed, to be made available to individuals who, for reasons not of their making, find themselves obliged to destroy large and potentially dangerous trees which would not have become infected had the UK authorities accepted their responsibilities for evading this disease when it became such an obvious threat at least eight years ago,\" he said.</p> <p>The Woodland Trust is pushing for a tree passport scheme to be introduced to help monitor imports. Its chief executive, Sue Holden, called on Saturday for a summit to be held on how further diseases could be kept out of the UK.</p> <p>\"We are clearly pleased to see Owen Paterson finally taking action to introduce a ban on the import and movement of ash trees into the UK,\" Holden said. \"We also ask government scientists to give urgent and clear advice to all woodland owners on how to manage the disease. The trust will do all it can to mitigate spread in line with this government instruction and advice.\"</p> <p>But she added: \"Ash dieback is only one of numerous tree pests and diseases in the UK. With more than 15 separate pests and diseases listed on the Forestry Commission website as already present [in the UK], it is crucial that the wider issue is tackled. The government must set up an emergency summit bringing together representatives from all areas of forestry, plant health and conservation \u2013 because today it's ash, but tomorrow yet another of our precious native trees could be at risk.\"</p> <p>In Pound Farm Wood in Suffolk, Ryder is striding off through the rain to check the rest of his trees. He hopes that alongside the growing list of infected ash trees he might find one or two \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/07/disease-killing-denmarks-ash-trees\" title=\"\">as has happened in Denmark</a> \u2013 that show signs of resistance to the fungus and remain untouched even while the deadly plague wipes out the majority of the species.</p> <p>\"Other species will come in and fill the gaps \u2013 of course they will, that's how nature works \u2013 but some things won't come back: the flowers and insects that rely on ash and the light it lets through on to the forest floor,\" he said. \"It isn't the first disease, historically, to come into our forests from abroad \u2013 even if it will have a more significant impact on our wider environment than most. But we need significantly tighter controls on our borders if we want it to be the last.\"</p>",
  "<p>If Manchester City were looking for a performance to cheer up their supporters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/ajax-manchester-city-champions-league\" title=\"\">after the Ajax defeat that looks to have put paid to this season's Champions League adventure</a>, this was not it. Roberto Mancini's team are still unbeaten in the Premier League, and can proudly point to another three points picked up when not playing particularly well, which is not something they have always been able to boast about, but any other boast based on this display would be hollow. With only slightly better finishing Swansea would have earned at least a point, food for thought for a team that now needs three wins against Ajax, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund.</p> <p>\"We deserved a point,\" Michael Laudrup said. \"They didn't create really big chances, we had the best ones. Their goal came out of nothing, it wasn't really a chance, but that's what champion teams can do to you.\"</p> <p>The Swansea manager's opposite number did not bother to pretend his side had played well. \"We were so tired,\" Mancini said. \"After the defeat in Europe this was a difficult moment for us, the only important thing was to win. We did that, we took three points. Now we can rest for a week.\"</p> <p>With a whopping 12 minutes and 38 seconds of added time after two second-half injuries, the game was officially the Premier League's longest ever, which will come as no surprise to anyone who watched it. It was slow to get properly started, with both teams passing the ball around midfield but failing to find any real penetration. Sergio Ag\u00fcero whisked purposefully past Chico Flores in the opening minutes without managing to open a route to goal, then Wayne Routledge did the same to Vincent Kompany at the other end, obliging the Manchester City captain to concede a foul. In the absence of goalmouth incident early on the chief talking point was an outrageous dive on the edge of the Manchester City penalty area by Angel Rangel, for which the Swansea full-back was correctly booked.</p> <p>Swansea are capable defenders, and when Gareth Barry wasted a rare opportunity to play Carlos Tevez into space behind the back line after half an hour it was a reminder of how much the home side are missing David Silva. The Spanish maestro is an expert at unlocking well-organised defences and without him Manchester City were predictable and somewhat short of ideas, with neither Tevez nor Ag\u00fcero as involved in the game as they would have liked.</p> <p>The visitors were content to contain and threaten danger on the break, which is exactly what they did with two separate thrusts upfield just before the interval. Manchester City got away with the first one at the expense of a booking for Micah Richards for a foul on Routledge, Kompany clearing Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez's eventual shot off the line, but Swansea should have taken the lead with the second when Joe Hart came off his line to smother a shot from Michu. It was a good stop by the goalkeeeper, yet Michu should have done better after staying onside to accept a wonderfully timed pass from Ki Sung-yueng. Manchester City's offside trap was well and truly sprung, yet just when it appeared scoring would be easier than missing a slightly heavy first touch from Michu gave Hart his chance.</p> <p>When Aleksandar Kolarov skied a free kick at the end of the first half a few boos were audible as the home side left the field. You never quite know when City fans are being ironic, but there certainly hadn't been much to cheer about in an underwhelming first half. Mancini conceded his side have a mountain to climb in Europe after defeat in Amsterdam in midweek \u2013 his cliche, not mine \u2013 and playing like this they will face an uphill task defending their Premier League title.</p> <p>Probably wisely, Mancini sent on Mario Balotelli for the second half, perhaps recognising that something was needed to enliven the proceedings, and with three at the front Manchester City quickly began to look more like their old selves. Ag\u00fcero shot too high as the second half opened, and Balotelli was unable to reach a cross from the right from Samir Nasri a couple of minutes later before appearing to be hampered by Flores as he attempted to reach another from Richards, but at least these efforts brought the crowd to its feet and turned up the background noise. During the first half Eastlands had been as quiet as a library, apart from the Swansea fans occasionally breaking the silence by saying so.</p> <p>Swansea were not going to take this lying down and once again gave their hosts a lesson in how to create a clear opportunity as the hour approached. Hern\u00e1ndez's cross from the right found Michu unmarked in front of goal, only for Swansea's leading scorer to squander another a good chance, directing his firm downward header straight at Hart. The visitors quickly came to rue their profligacy, for within a minute Manchester City had taken the lead, Tevez conjuring a goal from almost nothing by shooting on sight after doing well to control an overhit pass from Ga\u00ebl Clichy. Furthermore, the partially unsighted Michel Vorm was unable to continue after injuring himself in diving to try to keep out the shot.</p> <p>Typically generous, Manchester City offered Swansea the chance of an equaliser when Nasri's attempted clearance went straight to Jonathan de Guzman, though the midfielder could not quite summon Tevez's accuracy and his shot flew a couple of feet wide.</p> <p>Having survived that scare, the home side had to negotiate the last 16 minutes with Kolo Tour\u00e9 on in place of Richards, who collapsed on his own in the penalty area when his knee appeared to give way. Worrying about switching formations in mid-game suddenly does not appear to be Richards's greatest concern.</p>",

The Reuters/Ipsos survey of likely voter intention had Obama ahead by a whisker, leading Romney by 47% to 45%.</p> <p>And research indicated that 88% of registered voters said they would definitely vote for one candidate or the other, leaving just 12% who are yet to decide who will get their nod for the White House.</p> <p>The final days of campaigning will focus on that section of society in a handful of key states that are crucial to winning the presidential run-off.</p> <p>On Saturday, Romney hopped on a plane in Ohio to head for a rally in Florida. Republicans are pinning their hopes to carrying both states if they are to oust Obama from the White House.</p> <p>\"Let's win this,\" Romney emailed to supporters in a rallying call Saturday, adding: \"We're defying odds and holding strong.\"</p> <p>His vice-presidential pick Paul Ryan was in Ohio Saturday morning to press home the Republican message.</p> <p>At a factory in New Philadelphia, he told would-be voters: \"You know what you have in front of you, you know your responsibility.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the president opted to head to New Hampshire Saturday to start his 10-day countdown to election day. Before doing so, he used a new TV ad to urge Americans to consider Romney's plans to roll back Wall Street reforms, reduce education spending and turn Medicare into a voucher system.</p> <p>At the same time, the Republican candidate planned to cut taxes for the super-rich, the attack ad added.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> When you've had a chastening experience, there's nothing as comforting as comfort. It could be the zesty ingestion of 47 Big Macs, spunking money you don't have on clothes you don't want or even a home Premier League fixture. Nothing is as likely to make Manchester City feel good about themselves. Since the start of 2011, their Premier League record at the Etihad puts the 'form' in 'formidable': P32 W29 D3 L0.</p> <p>City are still the best team in the Premier League. This is worth reiterating given their status as the crisis club of English football, on a notorious losing streak of one game. They have made a slightly absent-minded start to their title defence, in part because of Roberto Mancini's think problem, but their imminent departure from the Champions League will focus those minds. All should be well with their world by 7.30pm.</p> <p>It's an important game for Swansea too, the start of a very tricky run of fixtures. In the next 10 games they play City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Newcastle, Liverpool, Arsenal and Spurs. There have been some scandalously premature judgements of Michael Laudrup's tenure. By Christmas we should have a much better idea how successful he is likely to be.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Swansea's last win at Manchester City</strong> came in 1951. That's a deceptive statistic, though; they've only played six games in the 61 years since. No, I'm not really sure what the point of this entry is.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Shameless plug department</strong> I wrote a chapter on Roy Keane (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/23/roy-keane-book-extract\">there's an extract here</a>) for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0956698115\">this book</a>. If everyone in the entire known universe buys a copy, I'll be so rich that I never have to MBM another game, so we all win.

They could play a couple of formations with that XI: it might an up-yours 3-5-2 from Roberto Mancini, with Gael Clichy as the left centre-back, but it's more likely to be a 4-2-3-1 with Samir Nasri on the right of midfield. Swansea are unchanged.</p> <p><strong>Manchester City (4-2-3-1)</strong> Hart; Richards, Kompany, Nastasic, Clichy; Y Toure, Barry; Nasri, Tevez, Kolarov; Aguero.<br>Subs: Pantilimon, Lescott, Toure, Evans, Sinclair, Dzeko, Balotelli. </p> <p><strong>Swansea City (4-2-3-1-0)</strong> Vorm; Rangel, Williams, Chico, Davies; Britton, Ki; Hernandez, De Guzman, Routledge; Michu.<br>Subs: Tremmel, Dyer, Graham, Monk, Shechter, Tiendalli, Agustien.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5.20pm</strong> \"Right, I've been disappointed by Villa and Norwich, I've been disappointed by my Quorn burgers for lunch, and I've been very disappointed by my 10-month-old son going for a nap rather than watching Star Wars Episode IV with me,\" says Matt Dony. \"This better be a helluva good MBM, Smyth!\" </p> <p>I'll bring my banter A-game.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Here's a question</strong> If you have big headphones, proper headphones, and a woolly hat, how can you wear the two at the same time? You can't wear the hat on top and if you wear the headphones on top it looks like you're auditioning for the winter season of Nathan Barley. You could just go without the music, of course, but a gentleman needs his Roxette fix on a cold winter's day.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> City (Manchester) kick off from right to left. They are in blue; Swansea are in white.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> City (Manchester) are indeed playing a 4-2-3-1 formation.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3 min</strong> \"Back when I used to spend my money on things like nice headphones, I would have two pairs, proper headphones, and then smaller headphones that would hook behind the ear which I could wear under a winter hat or on an oppressively warm day,\" says Kari Tulinius. \"Big headphones and woolly hats don't play well together.\" This head ain't big enough for the both of 'em, and all that.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4 min</strong> It's been a pretty quiet start to the game, with more than a whiff of prawn sandwiches about the atmosphere.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>5 min</strong> Britton plays a crisp 10-yard pass straight into touch. Swansea have been good without the ball but poor with it in the first few minutes.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8 min</strong> Aguero feels Williams at his back and swerves majestically around him. When he's tackled the ball breaks to Tevez in the area, and Chico makes a superb sliding tackle before Tevez can get a shot in.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>10 min</strong> This is all very sluggish thus far. Whatever happened to the fast start? In 2002 Arsenal seemed to be 2-0 up after 10 minutes every second week. Now teams would rather feel their way into the game.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>11 min</strong> \"It is for such occasions that the humble boombox was invented,\" says Ben Stanley. \"This has the additional advantage of allowing you to drown out the tinny grime emanating from some spotty teenager's iPhone speaker with a blast of Physical Graffiti.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>13 min</strong> Kompany fouls De Guzman down the left, which gives Swansea their first attacking set piece. It's swung deep by De Guzman and, although Williams was flagged offside, Hart didn't know that when he came for the ball and made a total hash of his attempted punch.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>15 min</strong> \"I know I'm pushing on an open door here Rob, but watching that selection of Laudrupisms just underlines how blessed are those blessed with outrageous balance,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Yet his contemporary, Preben Elkjaer, was a magnificently balanced footballer too \u2013 though in a completely different way. Elkjaer seemed always to be on the edge of falling over, always flat out to try to keep up with the ball and his footballing brain, always baffling us with how he actually did the things he did. Though Laudrup is at the extreme end of 'his' balance spectrum with the likes of Zidane, Beckenbauer and Muller, is Elkjaer on a spectrum all of his own? I can't think of many who played like him with quite that level of ability, like an ultra deluxe Ade Akinbiyi. Someone should write a book about those mid-80s Danes.\"</p> <p>Quite. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtRdIWyU3Ic#t=9m20s\">This is a great example of his balance</a>. Elkjaer was one of those players, like Jan Ceulemans, who never gave defenders even a second's peace. One Spanish paper described him as \"the human locomotive\", which is lovely.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> This game is a mess. Both sides have been unusually loose in possession.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> Gareth Barry, the Englishman, palpably obstructs Angel Rangel, the foreign man, sending him flying as a result. The foreign man is booked for diving.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>20 min</strong> Aside from that Chico tackle on Tevez, Manchester have not even had a sniff of a chance. They aren't being helped by a seriously subdued atmosphere.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>21 min</strong> \"We are still in the bar, Rob,\" hics my colleague Ian McCourt, who was in the bar during the first MBM five hours ago.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Hernandez, on the right, swings a superb cross towards Michu, who is about to head for goal when Micah Richards comes round from the side to head away. In doing so he clashes heads with Michu, who drops straight to the ground and may well have been knocked out for a few seconds. He receives treatment before being helped to his feet by Joe Hart, and I think he'll be okay to continue. That was a great piece of defending from Richards, because Michu was only ten yards out and would surely have scored.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> \"I can't have been the only one to see that Elkjaer clip and thought, '<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeRlJJbtdHc\">What would Benjamin Massing do</a>?'\" says Richard Dorman.</p> <p>You know you've left a decent football legacy when your surname becomes a verb.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>26 min</strong> City, as Chris Waddle says on ESPN, have been far too slow in possession. I'm not quite sure why. They look like a team who are so used to going behind (and then coming back to win) that they need it to happen again before they wake up. In a daft way the worst thing Swansea could do here is score a goal.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> This is even worse than Aston Villa v Norwich City.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Apart from this game, and the one earlier, what would be your nominations for The Joy of Six: Stinkers.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>30 min</strong> Kolarov and Nasri have switched wings. This is the extent of the excitement just now.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Does anyone else remember Leeds 0-0 Blackburn in 1996-97, live on a Monday night? That was the stinker's stinker, and more exciting than this.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>32 min</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gb5ZlZTQUw\">If this game was a song</a> ...</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> Gareth Barry overhits a 10-yard through pass to Carlos Tevez by at least five yards. A 50 per cent ineptitude ratio, which is pretty special.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>34 min</strong> \"How many Stoke games are you willing to list in the JOS: Stinkers?\" says Mike. \"Switzerland v Ukraine World Cup 2006 haunts me still.\"</p> <p>I think there's a support group for people who watched the entirety of that game.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Clichy bombs into space down the left \u2013 and sidefoots a cross straight out of play. Is this a deliberate parody of an awful football match? If so it's note perfect.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>36 min</strong> Vorm, obviously bored of having bugger all to do, passes the ball straight to Aguero, 25 yards from goal. He moves it forward to Tevez in the area, where Rangel comes round to make an excellent interception.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>37 min</strong> Michu has a goal rightly disallowed for offside. It was a classy finish, though, clipped high beyond the advancing Hart.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>38 min</strong> \"Birmingham v Wolves in the Carling Cup last season,\" says Phil Booth. \"Has to be.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>39 min</strong> An actual shot on goal. No word of a lie. Tevez had a little space on the right side of the box and drilled a sharp but straight shot that was comfortably saved by Vorm. Moments later, Swansea had their first half-chance. Richards cleaned out De Guzman on the edge of the area, but Martin Atkinson played a good advantage, allowing Hernandez to swerve into the box and hit a low cross that was hoofed clear from under the bar by Kompany. When the ball went dead, Atkinson booked Richards for his earlier attempt at a tackle.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>41 min</strong> Hart makes a fine save to deny Michu. The chance came when he broke beyond a static defence onto a superb angled through pass from Ki. Michu's first touch was a <em>fraction</em> too heavy, and it allowed Hart to charge from his line. Michu tried to dink it over the top with his second touch but Hart had got to within a couple of yards of him and was able to block the shot. Great goalkeeping.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>43 min</strong> \"The 1994 World Cup final nearly killed off my nascent interest in football when I was 8,\" says Matt Roberts. \"Abysmal match.\"</p> <p>But it had Viola's 14 minutes of fame. And it was Barry Davies's only World Cup final, so it gets a pass.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>45 min</strong> City get a corner, their first I think, on the left wing. It's taken by Aguero, and it doesn't clear the front man's feet, never mind his head. There will be two minutes of added ambience.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>45+1 min</strong> \"The girls behind the bar are giving us free shots,\" says Ian McCourt. How did you swing that? Did you tell them you know Tom Lutz?</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>45+2 min</strong> The half in miniature. City win a free kick on the right, maybe 35 yards from goal. All the big men come forward. Tevez hoofs it miles over everyone, and the crossbar.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Half time: Manchester City 0-0 Swansea City</strong> We must never talk of that half of football again. Ever.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Obvious half-time thought</strong> David Silva is having a good game.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Half-time emails</strong></p> <p>\"The worst match I can remember is definitely Ireland v Norway in the 1994 World Cup group stage. It's hard to forget the sight of John Sheridan hoofing it 40 yards upfield every time the ball came to him, followed by John Aldridge thinking about running after it but deciding instead to trot back infield with a shake of his head\" \u2013 James Roscow.</p> <p>\"Virtually all of Alex McLeish's games in the Premier League are tripping over each other in the boredom stakes\" \u2013 Conor Seery.</p> <p>\"Micah Richards was the last man on the tackle he was booked for and should have been sent off. No one has seemed to notice though\" \u2013 Rasmus. (He was last man but I don't think it was a clear goalscoring opportunity.)</p> <p>\"Evening Rob. Pop Quiz. Who is the only man to have scored in a World Cup semi-final and the Dundee derby? That's right, Claudio Caniggia. I once met him in the Overgate shopping centre in Dundee, one of the more surreal experiences of my life\" \u2013 Simon McMahon.</p> <p>\"How tall need a player be to receive praise for his balance? With the likes of Romario, Messi, Aguero etc, I've always taken it for granted. Yet Seedorf's ability to drop his center of gravity from one leg to the other has always amazed me. Surely some kind of <em>mometer</em> is due...\" \u2013 Phil Podolsky.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Swansea kick off from right to left. City have replaced Aleksandar Kolarov with Mario Balotelli.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> City have had a half-time hairdryer \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/oddballs/916128-roberto-mancini-has-hairdryer-installed-at-manchester-citys-stadium\">possibly literally </a>\u2013 and have already shown more urgency in the first two minutes of the half than they did in the 47 minutes of the first.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> \"I'm in California visiting some college buddies,\" says Eric Calhoun. \"I convinced everyone to get up for the 9:30am kick-off and watch the game over breakfast, and now I'm not allowed to make suggestions the rest of the trip.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> I wonder if a team who are unbeaten in the league at the end of October have ever been under such scrutiny as City right now.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>51 min</strong> Balotelli has just missed a very good chance. He was put through on goal by a lovely pass by Nasri and decided to go round Vorm instead of shooting. His touch was too heavy, however, and took him almost to the touchline on the left side of the box. By the time he passed the ball back into the middle, a group of Swansea defenders had got back and one of them was able to clear. In Balotelli's defence, Vorm was out extremely quickly to him.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>53 min</strong> It's all City now. Tevez splits the defence with a stunning pass to find Richards in the box on the right. He eschews the shot and instead drags it across the face of goal towards Balotelli, who just can't reach the ball to put it into the open net. Balotelli claimed he was dragged down by Chico and went head to head with Williams; replays suggest he made the most of very little contact. No way was that a penalty. It was a wonderful pass from Tevez, Laudrupesque in fact. It was pretty much in a straight line, over a distance of about 30 yards, and took four players out of the game.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> \"In 2006 I was living in the US and didn't have TV,\" says Kari Tulinius. \"However, my landlady let me go to her apartment to watch World Cup games on a Spanish-language channel. I was the only tenant who was allowed that, but then I was the only tenant who had any desire to go into her apartment, on account of her cat. That kitty was just about the most malignant, crazed feline I have ever heard of. It would jump on whomever entered the apartment and just straight-up maul them with claws extended. It would even attack its owner, but she, being ex-military police, was a tough lady and didn't mind. However, for some reason, that cat took a shine to me, which garnered me some privileges in return for taking care of the cat whenever the landlady was away. When I'd go downstairs to watch games, the cat would inevitably curl up next to me on the sofa and purr. Usually it would sleep, no matter how excited I'd get, and wouldn't pay any attention to the screen. However, during the Switzerland \u2013 Ukraine game, as it was becoming increasingly clear that extra time was upon us, the cat woke up, looked at the TV for a minute or so, and then stepped up on me and put its front paws on my chest and started kneading me. As I looked down at it, the cat put one paw on my throat. I could feel its claws on my skin. It looked up at me, as if saying: 'I can end it for you now, if that makes your pain go away.' After a second's consideration of its offer, I shook my head, and the cat took its paw away from my throat and curled up in my lap, where it stayed all the way to the end of the match. That is almost entirely a true story.\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> Swansea can't put three passes together. The atmosphere is still pretty subdued but you do feel a City goal is on the way.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>59 min</strong> Michu produces another important save from Hart. Swansea's first decent attack of the second half almost led to a goal. After a long series of short passes, Hernandez broke away on the right and clipped over a cross towards Michu near the penalty spot. He sent a diving header towards goal but it was a bit too close to Hart, who dived smartly to his right to save. Michu will probably feel he should have scored; had it been in the corner, Hart would have had no chance. He didn't get enough of a flick on the header.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester City 1-0 Swansea City (Tevez 61)</strong> This is an excellent goal from Carlos Tevez. Nasri played a square ball to him, 25 yards from goal, slightly to the right of centre. He didn't have much space but had enough time to take a touch and then crunch a fine shot that dipped nastily and arrowed into the far corner. The way Tevez stunned the ball meant it wobbled a bit like a plastic ball, but ultimately it was the accuracy of the shot that was decisive. Vorm had no chance really, although he injured his groin in his attempt to save and is going to be stretchered off.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Play still hasn't restarted. Vorm is being helped very carefully onto a stretcher by five or six physios.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Vorm is finally replaced by Gerhard Tremmel, and Swansea kick off five minutes after conceding.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> \"Like in most things, Premier League era ennui is nothing to real football era ennui,\" says Jon Millard. \"Arsenal and Coventry seemed to be both perpetually televised in the 80s, and also, like Spinal Tap's Fire and Ice, perpetually produce lukewarm water. In 86/87 they gave us a shocking 0-0, and that so impressed ITV that they let them reproduce the exact scoreline and level of tedium next year. Being the 80s, you couldn't even watch it in the pub. Great.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>71 min</strong> Michu's header from De Guzman's cross hits the outstretched hand of Kompany. There was a slight penalty appeal from Michu but nothing really. Kompany was only a couple of yards away from Michu, although he did have his arms raised. It would have been a pretty harsh penalty.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>72 min</strong> Swansea replace a midfielder, Leon Britton, with a striker, Danny Graham. Michu will drop back into the hole.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> City still look unconvincing in defence. Nasri's pathetic clearance goes straight to De Guzman, 25 yards out. He shapes to go to the left of Hart and then sweeps a curler the other way, just past the far post. That was a fine effort.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>75 min</strong> Apparently the Swansea chef, who is not a svelte gentleman, has broken his seat in the dugout. Yes, this is the bit where we link to Vito Spatafore (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNSpVvqqlJU\">warning: clip has adult language</a>).</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>77 min</strong> City have started sleepwalking through the game again, which has allowed Swansea to get back into the game. Pablo Hernandez clearly has his shirt pulled in the area by Nastasic, but it's not seen by the referee Martin Atkinson. That should have been a penalty, <a href=\"http://d.yimg.com/i/ng/sp/empics/20091128/15/2474828724-soccer-barclays-premier-league-portsmouth-v-manchester-united-fratton-park.jpg\">although only Mike Dean tends to give them</a>.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Swansea make their final change, with Nathan Dyer replacing Pablo Hernandez.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>80 min</strong> Micah Richards is running towards his own goal when suddenly he collapses to the floor. He's beating the turf in pain, and it seems to be a knee problem. That looks pretty nasty. He had treatment for cramp a few minutes earlier but I don't think it's that. He looked in agony when it happened and now, as a stretcher is prepared, he is receiving oxygen. He may have ruptured something.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>84 min</strong> Richards, still receiving oxygen, is helped slowly onto a stretcher and off the field. What a strange game of football this has been; two players have been stretchered off with apparently serious injuries, both after no contact with any other players.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>85 min</strong> Richards is replaced by Kolo Toure. There will probably be at least 10 minutes of added time in this match.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Nathan Dyer is booked for a sliding foul on Gael Clichy. That seemed a little harsh.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> He broke his seat!</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> \"Did you see Michael Vaughan's jive on Strictly the other week, Rob?\" says Simon McMahon. \"Didn't see that coming back in 2005.\" You wanna talk some jive? I'll talk some jive. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zGQrybWi0\">I'll talk some jive like you never heard</a>!</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>89 min</strong> An excellent inswinging cross from the right by, er, a Swansea player just evades the leaping Graham before drifting wide of the far post. Manchester City have been really poor in the last 15 minutes and a Swansea goal wouldn't be at all surprising.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> There will be 12 minutes of Fergie Time. That's about right in view of the injuries and substitutions.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>90+2 min</strong> He broke his seat!</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>90+3 min</strong> This has been such a strange game, with an atmosphere so muted as to be almost unsettling. Dyer plays a smart one-two with Rangel and then blitzes a stunningly inept cross well wide of the near post.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>90+4 min</strong> When the ball goes out for a Swansea throw-in, Michael Laudrup scoops the ball up to Ben Davies. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfDdTgM2CeU\">Which is as good an excuse as any to post this link</a>.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>90+6 min</strong> City make their final substitution, with Joleon Lescott replacing Sergio Aguero. It's not a switch to three in defence; Lescott has gone to centre back, Nastasic left back and Clichy left midfield.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>90+7 min</strong> A loose ball breaks to Ki, 25 yards out, and he blooters a half-volley miles wide.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>90+9 min</strong> Balotelli wins a corner with an excellent run down the right. Nothing comes from it.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>90+10 min</strong> Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>90+11 min</strong> After a dodgy spell either side of the Richards injury, Manchester City have been comfortable enough in added time. Not remotely convincing, but not in any real danger of conceding.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>90+13 min</strong> This is now the longest Premier League game in history.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>Full time: Manchester City 1-0 Swansea</strong> Balotelli almost scores with the last kick of the game, thrashing a shot that is either tipped over or hits the bar. Who cares? Thank goodness that game is over. At first it was terrible; then it was unnerving with freak injuries to Michel Vorm and Micah Richards; and by the end of 13 minutes of added time it was just plain weird. Thanks for your emails; night.</p>",
  "<p>On a sun-drenched autumn day in L'Aquila, Vincenzo Vittorini peered into the huge hole in the ground where his house once stood and recalled the night his wife and nine-year-old daughter were crushed to death.</p> <p>Scared by the scores of tremors that had shaken L'Aquila for four months, the Vittorinis were huddled together in bed in their top-floor apartment that night, 5 April 2009. When the earthquake struck at 3.32am, all three plummeted three storeys as the building folded like paper.</p> <p>Miraculously Vittorini, 49, was unscathed, never lost consciousness and was dug out at 9am by a neighbour. His family were less fortunate. \"My wife and daughter did not die immediately,\" he said, his voice trailing off. Did he hear voices as he lay trapped? \"I heard everything, unfortunately.\"</p> <p>Like many local people, Vittorini had decided to stay at home that night, having been reassured by a meeting of Italy's leading earthquake experts five days earlier, on 31 March. Just before attending the meeting, the deputy head of Italy's civil protection agency, Bernardo De Bernardinis, promised the tremors were helping the earth release pent-up energy and called the situation \"favourable\".</p> <p>\"During a tremor the day before the meeting, everyone in L'Aquila had run for the streets, but on the night of the fifth, after the meeting, we felt the initial tremors, said 'this is good, the more the merrier', and went to bed,\" recalled Vittorini, a surgeon and local councillor. The following morning 308 people were dead, 1,600 were injured and L'Aquila was a patchwork of rubble following a 6.3 magnitude shock.</p> <p>Last week those six scientists, plus De Bernardinis, were handed six-year sentences for manslaughter by a judge in L'Aquila, a verdict that drew a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/23/chilling-verdict-laquila-earthquake\" title=\"\">furious reaction from the world's scientific community</a> amid claims that scientists cannot be sent to jail for their findings. Enzo Boschi, one of the convicted experts, compared himself to Galileo, who was tried by the Vatican in 1633 for claiming the Earth revolved around the Sun. Another claimed the court had wanted \"an eye for an eye\".</p> <p>After rows over climate change, genetically modified food and most recently bovine TB and the merits of badger culls, the L'Aquila trial is just the latest scuffle between science and society that has seen scientists forced out of their laboratories and on to the frontline in political battles shaping the world's future.</p> <p>As a battlefield, L'Aquila fits the bill. The cracked and crumbling palazzi that line the streets of its once busy centre are now shored up by metal brackets and abandoned, awaiting reconstruction, while weeds creep along the empty cobbled streets. Bored army patrols looking for looters stand by split-open buildings where bathroom mirrors glint in the sun and washing still hangs from balconies, greyed after three winters.</p> <p>Survivors of the quake who celebrated the verdict last week were quick to stress that the convictions of the experts had been misunderstood \u2013 they were not punished for failing to predict the quake, as widely understood, but for offering unreasonable reassurances that no earthquake would come.</p> <p>\"We were desperate for news after leaving the house repeatedly in the wake of four months of growing tremors,\" said Maurizio Cora, a local lawyer, who tried in vain to dig his wife and two daughters out alive from rubble when their apartment building collapsed. \"That night we took the advice of Italy's most senior experts and stayed in.\"</p> <p>One of those experts, Franco Barberi, denied he or his colleagues had offered reassurances. \"I attended the press conference after the meeting on 31 March and said earthquakes were not predictable and nothing could be excluded,\" he said.</p> <p>The problem, he said, stemmed from the optimistic interview given by De Bernardinis before the meeting. \"That interview should have been countered,\" he said. \"The civil protection agency had a responsibility to do that and evidently did not.\" De Bernardinis's optimism appeared to be similar to that of his boss, Guido Bertolaso, who did not attend the meeting but arranged it. Under investigation at the time in a corruption probe, Bertolaso had his phone tapped, and investigators overheard him telling a local official he was staging the meeting as a \"media event\" to \"quieten imbeciles\" who feared a big quake. Bertolaso had already decided to take legal action against a local scientist who had forecast that a surge in the release of radon from the ground was a sure sign trouble was coming.</p> <p>But Bertolaso's lawyer, Filippo Dinacci, said the sense of the conversation had been twisted. \"He also criticises the official for issuing a statement saying there would be no more quakes and tells her, 'You don't even do that under torture'. That is the opposite of what he is accused of.\"</p> <p>Cora said that, even if the scientists were not prepared to rule out a major quake, they were at fault for not speaking out after De Bernardinis claimed the tremors were releasing energy. \"No one denied what he said,\" he recalled.</p> <p>\"The energy release idea was nonsense, the scientists unplugged their brains and obeyed the politicians,\" said Giustino Parisse, a news editor at local newspaper <em>Il Centro</em>, whose son, daughter and father were killed in the quake. \"At that meeting I think they felt the need to calm people down.\"</p> <p>Last Thursday, local councillors in L'Aquila gathered to listen in silence to another wiretap released by prosecutors in which Bertolaso appeared to instruct Boschi about speaking to the press after the main quake. \"These wiretaps show the complete control of the state over science,\" Vittorini told his fellow councillors.</p> <p>At the time of the quake, Bertolaso was a rising star in Italian politics, often seen at the side of Silvio Berlusconi and entrusted by the then prime minister to help solve crises including the tonnes of uncollected rubbish cluttering the streets of Naples. \"Bertolaso viewed himself as Superman, just like Berlusconi, and believed there was no reality apart from the one he lived,\" said local journalist Barbara Bologna.</p> <p>Bertolaso is now under investigation for his role, butlast week denied he had ever bullied scientists. \"I never needed to impose anything on the scientists who worked with us,\" he wrote on his website. \"He has no responsibility here,\" added Dinacci.</p> <p>Three years on, residents who were hurriedly shifted to new homes after the quake say Italy's political class has since compounded its error by delaying the reconstruction of the historic centre of L'Aquila.</p> <p>A student dormitory building where eight people died remains a gutted shell, surrounded by a metal fence draped with curling photographs of the dead and withered flowers.</p> <p>The town's decision to allow bars to reopen in the deserted centre brings in crowds by night, creating a surreal rave atmosphere among the empty buildings, but by day the cordoned-off streets feel like a film set, with the odd construction worker silhouetted against the Abruzzo mountains that surround the town.</p> <p>\"There is nothing happening, we are two years late,\" said the mayor, Massimo Cialente, who blames the special commissioners sent in to handle the work. \"It has been like Kabul here, and I am [Afghan president Hamid] Karzai,\" he said. \"It was not done deliberately, it was just sheer incompetence.\"</p> <p>As reconstruction starts in earnest next year, the seven men convicted of manslaughter will be launching their appeal against their sentences.</p> <p>Parisse said that, despite losing his children on the night of 5 April, he did not want damages and he did not want revenge. \"We just need to learn from this. I don't want it to happen again,\" he said.</p> <p>Vincenzo Vittorini walked away from the hole where his house once stood. \"My hope,\" he said, \"is that no one ever builds on this spot.\"</p>",
  "<p>When two young children were killed, allegedly by their nanny, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, much of the coverage of the crime prominently mentioned the family's class: their \"luxury apartment\" \u2013 complete with comparable rents \u2013 and affluence seemed to be a strangely consistent part of the coverage.</p> <p>But in New York, a city of working families and significant ambition, you don't need to be rich, necessarily, to hire a nanny. There are two-income families in more bohemian precincts, like those of Park Slope in Brooklyn, where nannies are a crucial part of allowing women to work, or to take care of their other children.</p> <p>Nannies are a crucial part of the economic equation for the professional classes \u2013 which, in New York, counts as part of the solid middle class. That includes doctors, lawyers, advertising and businesspeople. Having a nanny will allow many mothers to go to work when otherwise they might be at home.</p> <p>In short, nannies are part of the shadow economy of New York City \u2013 the quiet economy that keeps the bigger one running. This is not just true for women who stay at home and whose husbands are high earners. Women make up more than half the population of New York City, and women-owned businesses make up a third of all the businesses in New York, according to the Census Bureau. Nationally, 23% of women out-earn their husbands, as a remarkable BusinessWeek story pointed out. The Census Bureau indicates that \u2013 again, speaking nationally \u2013 more than half of all managerial positions are filled by women. </p> <p>At the same time, women's wages have not kept pace with their accomplishments in the workplace.</p> <p>The Government Accounting office found that working women pay a financial \"penalty\" for having kids \u2013 a 2.5% pay cut compared to women without children. This is on top of the fact that women with professional degrees are paid 67 cents to the dollar of men with the same education, and in the financial industry \u2013 a major center of revenues for New York \u2013 women are paid 71 cents to a man's dollar.</p> <p>Can you see that happening without nannies or childcare? Increasingly, paying high costs for childcare is the price many families pay for advancing in their careers and achieving the new version of the American dream. Particularly in the context of New York's cost of living, dual-income families are common by necessity, and as a result, so are nannies.</p> <p>Clifford Greenhouse, president of the Pavillion Agency and the Nanny Authority, helps affluent families find nannies in New York. In much of the country, his clients would be described by income as rich. In New York, they are of the professional class. \"A large percentage of our clientele are working families \u2026 investment bankers, professionals, physicians, attorneys, in the arts, real estate. They are dual-income families but very high earners.\"</p> <p>These families, with the resources of high-powered careers, are able to foot the very high cost of having a nanny provided by an agency. Pavillion's nannies get paid $52,000 a year and up, and the agency itself gets 15% of that salary in fees \u2013 so $7,500 and up. Many of its nannies make six-figure salaries. Parents also have to pay health insurance, social security benefits, disability benefits, and, if the nanny lives with them, she requires a separate room and bath. Pavillion employs 20 people, check references, perform background checks, interview nannies, and match them with families. He described the process to me. It is an enormous amount of work.</p> <p>But a lot of the professional, dual-income families who have nannies don't necessarily use services like Pavillion. They can find nannies on Craigslist, where prices are negotiated. Then parents have to do all that work \u2013 the background checks, the references, the interviews \u2013 on their own time. Missing days of work is inevitable, for one or both parents.</p> <p>Greenhouse suggests that working parents either find a nanny by word of mouth, or else pay for very good daycare. By word of mouth, he has a very specific definition: \"The mom knows another mom \u2013 a dear friend, a colleague, a business associate \u2013 who are relocating. The mom has most likely interacted with their nanny over the past few years, and is confident she's been happy with this nanny.\" He advises against the kind of word-of-mouth by which parents may ask a nanny to suggest a friend they've never met.</p> <p>His advice: \"If at the end of the day, you pay 50% more than you should have for a nanny, and you can go to work with peace of mind, then it's worth it. You can't put a price on it.\"</p> <p>Neither can the country. Having more women in the workforce, and more women in managerial positions, will bring more talk and stories of nannies to the forefront. And soon, having a nanny or reliable daycare may not just be seen as the luxury of the rich, or even the affluent. It will be seen, rightly, as the price of having a balanced US economy.</p>",
  "<p>Long lines quickly formed as early voting began in Florida on Saturday and electors confronted the longest ballot in their history, consisting of a range of choices from the next president to measures affecting healthcare reforms, the independence of the state supreme court and abortion.</p> <p>Florida is a tight and important swing state, particularly for Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, who probably cannot win the presidency without taking its 29 electoral college votes.</p> <p>Opinion polls consistently put Romney about two percentage points ahead of Barack Obama, and both camps say the outcome is likely to be decided by which side can turn out supporters.</p> <p>The monster ballot includes 11 proposed amendments to the state constitution, some of which run for hundreds of words.</p> <p>Officials advised people to read the wording before arriving at polling places but lines still backed up as it took even those voters familiar with the ballots about 10 minutes to fill them out. Others said they spent up to half an hour to complete the forms.</p> <p>\"I came prepared,\" said Yvette Florian, waving the prepared ballot she copied her choices from, after voting at the Hart Memorial Central Library in Kissimmee.</p> <p>By mid-morning the line to vote extended down a flight of stairs and into the middle of the library.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of people want to vote. I think this is going to be a passionate election. There's people who don't want their welfare taken away and people who believe you should do it the old fashioned way and stand on your own two feet.\"</p> <p>Florian said she voted Republican.</p> <p>\"Romney won't run up more debt. Or if he does, his spending will create more jobs. It won't be handouts to the gimmies. I'm not a warmonger but if Romney spends on the military it's still creating jobs,\" said Florian who works for the state health department.</p> <p>Joseph Saenz couldn't disagree more.</p> <p>\"We need to keep social security going and Medicare. There's people who don't want to help people who need it,\" he said.</p> <p>Saenz, who works as a maintenance man for a liquor store, said he voted for Obama.</p> <p>\"He hasn't done everything he should have,\" he said. \"But [the Republican-controlled] Congress has stopped him doing what he wanted to do. It's like he's banging his head into a brick wall.\"</p> <p>Besides electing the president, members of the US Congress and the Florida legislature, many voters in the state are choosing local councils, sheriffs and other officials.</p> <p>They are also being asked to decide on proposed changes to Florida's state constitution. First on the list is a measure designed to block Obama's healthcare reforms by prohibiting laws that compel individuals to buy medical insurance \u2013 a key part of the president's legislation. </p> <p>Yesenia Valentin said she supported the change.</p> <p>\"I don't like to be told what to do,\" she said. \"The less federal government the better.\"</p> <p>Valentin said she voted a straight Republican ticket with the exception of the local sheriff.</p> <p>Even if the healthcare amendment passes, it is not clear that it is enforceable given that the US supreme court has already upheld what is known as the individual mandate.</p> <p>Legislators have also placed an amendment on the ballot that would exempt abortion-related matters from the state's privacy laws.</p> <p>The measure comes after Florida courts blocked the legislatures attempts to pass laws limiting access to abortion, citing the state's constitutional protections of privacy. The proposed change also bars state funds from paying for health insurance that includes abortion coverage.</p> <p>Other constitutional amendments on the ballot include a proposal by the Republican-controlled Florida legislature to curb the power of the state supreme court which conservatives have frequently criticised as too liberal in its judgments.</p> <p>More than 1 million of the estimated 9 million Floridians expected to vote have already cast an absentee ballot. Marginally more registered Republicans have voted than Democrats but the gap, at 5%, is considerably less than at the last presidential election \u2013 eroding a Republican advantage.</p> <p>Voting is easier than Republican legislators had hoped after a federal court struck down a stringent new identification law as discriminatory.</p> <p>The court also blocked restrictions on independent groups registering voters. But other new measures are in place including a cut in the number of early voting days and the closure of polling booths on the final Sunday before the election \u2013 the day on which large numbers of black people voted in Florida in 2008.</p> <p>Black churches have been leading a push, \"Souls to the Polls\", to get African Americans to vote early this weekend.</p> <p>The state also made it more difficult for those who move house to register to vote, which is thought to disproportionately affect students who tend to lean toward the Democrats.</p> <p>Floridians are particularly sensitive to problems with the vote given the state's notorious role in the 2000 election when votes that could have delivered victory to the Democratic party candidate, Al Gore, were discounted as part of the \"hanging chad\" fiasco.</p> <p>But already there are signs of trouble. Officials in Palm Beach county have spent the week painstakingly duplicating about 27,000 absentee ballots because a design flaw on the ballot papers meant the scanners could not read them. Every copied ballot is inspected by a Democratic party and a Republican poll watcher.</p>",
  "<p>The empty bookshelves piled up in the walkways of Nap Ford community school are a reminder of what a high-stakes business education in Florida has become; the surplus furniture is all that remains of a nearby school that closed this summer after being graded an \"F\" two years in a row.</p> <p>Jennifer Porter-Smith, principal of Nap Ford, needs little reminder. Her own school was downgraded to an F two years ago.</p> <p>\"It was devastating,\" she recalled. \"We pulled the team together and said the state is basically saying we are failing children \u2013 what are we going to do about it?\"</p> <p>For over a decade now, schools in Florida have been graded from A to F based on the performance and progress of their pupils in reading, writing, maths and science tests. A-grade or improving schools are rewarded with extra money, while schools receiving the lowest grade twice in a row face closure.</p> <p>It is a part of a package of reforms introduced under former governor Jeb Bush, which have become a model for other states and has been echoed in Barack Obama's education policy.</p> <p>The downgrading had a galvanising effect on Porter-Smith's school.</p> <p>\"We became very strategic and very focussed,\" she said. \"How do we equate what is happening in the classroom with student performance?</p> <p>\"We could have beautiful lesson plans, but are students understanding what is going on?\"</p> <p>Within a year, the school's grade had gone from an F to an A. The school's staff worked equally hard both years, the principal says, but focused more on preparation for testing in the year they were awarded the top grade.</p> <p>Since leaving office, Bush has become an advocate for education reform; setting up a non-proft foundation and touring the country to advise Republican politicians.</p> <p>In his speech to the Republican convention, the former governor emphasised the progress made by black and Hispanic children in Florida, who are now more likely to graduate from high school than their counterparts in other states.</p> <p>The racial dimension of education reform is significant; its proponents often call it the \"civil rights issue of our generation\". The appeal to conservative politicians who need minority voters is obvious.</p> <p>As well as grading schools, the Bush measures included requiring third graders to pass reading tests before they could move up to fourth grade, creating a merit pay system for teachers, and extending parental choice by encouraging the creation of independently run charter schools.</p> <p>At school level, the impact of the reforms has inevitably been messy. A school's grading has become crucial. Nap Ford is a small primary school \u2013 teaching from pre-kindergarten to fifth grade \u2013 in a tough urban setting where 98% of pupils are on free or reduced lunches, an indicator of poverty.</p> <p>\"Because we're such a small school, one child can be five or six percentage points,\" Porter-Smith said. There are 153 children in the school, but only the upper two grades take the tests.</p> <p>There is a high rate of teacher turnover. In one class a new teacher left after a single day. That particular class had six teachers in three months.</p> <p>The principal said: \"A lot of the urban community are disproportionately taught by new teachers, who are going to have a challenge managing the classroom. Children get multiple years of that.\"</p> <p>Being downgraded prompted the school to question what it was doing. But it also made life harder as philanthropic funding dried up.</p> <p>The principal said: \"When you have a year where a school gets an F, fundraising becomes harder, everybody wants to back someone who's doing well.\"</p> <p>That in turn made it impossible to pay for a longer school day, which was one of the measures the school had introduced to support its pupils.</p> <p>A study which looked at the impact of Florida's school grading found that it had a detrimental effect on teacher turnover. The research by economists Li Feng, David Figlio and Tim Sass said that: \"Schools that were 'shocked' downwards \u2013 and thus faced the most pressure to improve \u2013 lost more and higher quality teachers.\"</p> <p>The Florida model is now being imitated by states across the country, inspiring new legislation in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Indiana.</p> <p>Obama has praised Bush as a \"champion of education reform\", and the changes in Florida are mirrored in many elements of the president's signature education initiative Race to the Top.</p> <p>The Obama initiative is a competition for federal funds, awarded to states that embrace changes including charter schools and performance pay for teachers.</p> <p>The reforms in Florida have put greater pressure on the school system in two ways; by increasing accountability for schools and teachers, and by giving parents more options than just their local public school.</p> <p>The state has a tax credit scheme that encourages companies to sponsor scholarships at private schools for families of modest means. It has also backed the creation of charter schools. There are now over 500 charters in the state, educating nearly 180,000 students in the last school year.</p> <p>The management of charters can be contracted out, allowing private education firms to make profits from running schools. One such firm, Academica, runs nearly 100 schools in the state.</p> <p>Michael Kooi, director of school choice for Florida, suggests that charters have made a difference by spurring change in the public system.</p> <p>\"Before [charter schools] they had a captive audience and now there's competition, let's face it,\" Kooi said.</p> <p>\"In order to keep kids they've improved for one thing but also provided more options to kids as well.</p> <p>\"That might [mean] just taking more of a math focus at high school, or maybe that you take fine arts classes.\"</p> <p>During the election campaign, Obama has downplayed school choice in favour of speaking about investment in education.</p> <p>Jeb Bush, by contrast, used <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" nib0atmm-s8\"\">his convention speech</a> to compare choosing between schools with the freedom to shop around for flavored milk in a supermarket. \"They even make milk for people who cannot drink milk,\" he said. \"Shouldn't parents have that kind of choice in schools that best meets the needs of their students?\"</p> <p>The gap between the two parties is narrower than it seems here. In the past, Obama's administration <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/us/politics/11web-educ.html?_r=\" 0\"\">has lauded charter schools</a> as \"laboratories of innovation\".</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-usa-chicago-schools-analysis-idUSBRE8890VS20120910\">confrontation in Chicago</a> has emphasised the consensus between the parties on charters. Though never officially a part of the dispute between Rahm Emanuel and the teachers' union, the mayor is pushing to expand the number of charters in the city.</p> <p>Common to both parties is an anxiety that the US is being outpaced by Asia while politicians and teachers dispute the details of change. Bush noted that China and India are producing \"eight times more engineering students each year\" than the US.</p> <p>Obama, more emolliently as far as his public sector supporters are concerned, declared: \"I don't believe that firing teachers \u2026 will grow the economy or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of Asia.\"</p> <p>Mark Pudlow, spokesman for the Florida Education Association, a teachers' union, said the state's school system has been a Petri dish for reform.</p> <p>\"Since Jeb Bush was elected governor we've been a laboratory for all kinds of corporate influence on public schools, without any input from teachers or credible education researchers,\" Pudlow said.</p> <p>Further change lies ahead. Last year, the current governor of Florida, Rick Scott, brought in new legislation which will overhaul the way teachers are paid. The Student Success Act means at least half of a classroom teacher's evaluation will be based on students' gains in standardised tests. Pay rises will be based on these evaluations, replacing a system in which teachers' evaluation is based entirely on a principal's assessment. But the statewide tests only cover reading, writing, maths and science, meaning that some teachers' evaluation will be based on subjects they have not taught.</p> <p>Pudlow said: \"Let's say you're a history teacher, there's no [standardised test] for history, but the law says you have to be evaluated on testing. If you're a history teacher you have to be evaluated by standardised tests given in subjects you don't teach.\"</p> <p>Even if school districts can evolve new tests to cover these subjects, the union argues that it will be difficult to measure teacher performance in areas such as physical education and music.</p> <p>At the heart of the argument over merit pay is a clash between the natural desire of governments to gather data and map performance, and the view of many teachers that school is a broad experience that resists being captured in test results.</p> <p>Nancy Hunter, who teaches at a high school in Leesburg, Florida, says that her subject is essentially unquantifiable. She teaches \"Freshman Foundations\" \u2013 a class in life skills that teaches children how to be \"good citizens\", Hunter said.</p> <p>\"I'm going to be evaluated on tests they're taking one day in the year and they may be kids I've never set eyes on.</p> <p>\"It's flawed in taking one day of one test rather than what I do day in and day out.\"</p> <p>Whoever wins the presidential election, the outcome is likely to disappoint teachers like Hunter. The mood in the US has shifted away from a belief in trusting professionals to one that emphasises scrutiny of schools through testing and parental choice. There will be more schools that fail to make the grade and end up as a pile of furniture in a corridor.</p>",
  "<h2>Championship</h2> <p>\"Nothing endures but change,\" said Heraclitus, and the Greek philosopher aptly describes the situation in the Championship at the moment, with a quarter of the division going into Saturday's games with a caretaker manager, including the Lancashire trio Blackburn, Bolton and Burnley along with Ipswich and Crystal Palace.</p> <p>Dougie Freedman assumes full control of Bolton on Monday having left Palace (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/25/dougie-freedman-bolton-modern-football\" title=\"\">as bemoaned by our very own Chris Waters</a>) in the week; his former club were handed the not-so-easy task of facing table-topping Leicester away, who were on the brink of their best start to a league campaign for 106 years. Leicester had previously won all six at home this season, conceding just two in the process but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/27/leicester-city-crystal-palace-championship\" title=\"\">let in two inside the first half hour to lose 2-1</a>; Palace defenders Damien Delaney and Peter Ramage both converting from inside the box. High-flying Eagles are now unbeaten in seven and stay fourth, and look no weaker now they are free of Freeman.</p> <p>The Scot watched his new club from the stands, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/27/middlesbrough-bolton-wanderers-championship\" title=\"\">with Bolton taking the lead against Middlesbrough</a> through Lee Chung-yong. But two second-half goals from Scott McDonald turned the tide for Boro, as Tony Mowbray marked three years in charge.</p> <p>In the day's basement battle, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/27/ipswich-sheffield-wednesday-championship\" title=\"\">Sheffield Wednesday travelled to rudderless Ipswich</a> and got the first goal of the day: Ross Barkley, on loan from Everton, scored the first of his two goals early on, with Michail Antonio sealing a 3-0 win on 81 minutes. The victory which was enough to take Wednesday out of the relegation zone \u2013 their first clean sheet and away win of the season. Bleak reading for Ipswich, <a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=11&amp;CPID=82\" title=\"\">who remain bottom</a> and are now 11 matches without a win.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Cardiff climbed to the league's summit with a comprehensive 4-0 drubbing of Burnley, Jordan Rhodes scored an injury-time winner for Blackburn at home to Watford, and Marlon Harewood opened the scoring for Barnsley against his former club Nottingham Forest, only for Forest to roar back with four in reply \u2013 the pick of the bunch coming from Chris Cohen who tomahawked a belter from 25 yards out.</p> <h2>League One</h2> <p>More managerial casualties in the third tier, with bottom-placed Hartlepool sacking Neale Cooper in the week, but led by Micky Barron they got a good 2-2 draw away at Brentford \u2013 their equaliser coming through a Tony Craig own goal in the 90th minute.</p> <p>Arguably the safest manager in the league is Paolo Di Canio at Swindon, and doesn't he just know it, claiming pre-match: \"I am not God, but I am a very good manager.\" And who can argue with that swagger, with Swindon continuing their quest for back-to-back promotions with a 4-0 win over second-placed Stevenage. On-loan John Bostock was mercurial in the middle of the park, with Miles Storey and Adam Rooney among the goals, to condemn Stevenage to their worst ever Football League defeat.</p> <p><a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=11&amp;CPID=83\" title=\"\">Tranmere remain top</a> despite a recent slump, their 1-1 draw with Preston on Saturday coming off the back of two defeats. It could have been worse had Jake Cassidy not scored a late equaliser, coming after Preston had missed a host of chances \u2013 Jack King the main culprit. Tranmere's slip means that Sheffield United will join them at the top if they win at home to Portsmouth on Monday night.</p> <p>Just enough room for me to squeeze in my Luke Chadwick tribute \u2013 the evergreen midfielder netted a fine brace (including a 25-yard curler) in MK Dons's 3-0 away win at Scunthorpe, whose supporters chanted \"Knill [Alan] Out!\" throughout most of the second-half.</p> <h2>League Two</h2> <p>Romain Vincelot scored on his debut as Gillingham beat AFC Wimbledon <a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=11&amp;CPID=69\" title=\"\">to move five points clear at the top</a>. Martin Allen's side have the league's most stingy defence, while Wimbledon have won just once in four games since Neal Ardley took charge at Kingsmeadow earlier this month.</p> <p>Another team looking better for losing their manager is Accrington Stanley, who edged a close encounter with Bristol Rovers by a single goal.

  "<h2><strong>Boyd Hilton, TV and reviews editor of Heat magazine</strong></h2> <p><br> First of all let me say I do not take this position lightly. Working out who is the best Bond is possibly the most important cultural conundrum of our time. Even more crucial than deciding the best Doctor in <em>Doctor Who</em> (Tom Baker, obviously). I would also admit that until about two weeks ago I would have stuck to the position that the first 007 I ever saw, Sean Connery, was still the ultimate Bond. Connery clearly did a superb job of turning Ian Fleming's character into an indelible film icon, and rarely put a foot wrong (although the less said about his misguided return in <em>Never Say Never Again</em>, the better). I was brought up on Connery's Bond. I love Connery's Bond.</p> <p>But now I've seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144416/skyfall\" title=\"\"><em>Skyfall</em></a>. OK, it is admittedly early days for Daniel Craig. He's only starred in three Bond films compared with Connery's six (proper ones). But two of Craig's \u2013 <em>Casino Royale</em> and <em>Skyfall</em> \u2013 are easily among the best of the series, and even the famously disappointing <em>Quantum of Solace</em> is actually perfectly watchable due in no small part to the steely, brutal, uncompromising charisma of Craig. He may not look much like Ian Fleming's conception of Bond but through the sheer unrelenting single-minded brilliance of his acting, he has now usurped Connery.</p> <h2><strong>Charlie Higson, Fast Show star and author of the Young James Bond books</strong></h2> <p><br> Right. I'll agree with you on Tom Baker, and I have to confess, before we start blasting away at each other with Walther PPKs (unless you want to claim the Beretta is better?), that I think Daniel Craig comes a very close second. Let's face it, though, if it wasn't for Connery Daniel Craig wouldn't even be up there on our screens. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/85424/dr-no\" title=\"\"><em>Dr No</em></a> was by no means a guaranteed success, but as soon as Connery was revealed at the gaming table and he delivered his famous catchphrase there was no looking back.</p> <p>It was the birth of a new kind of hero. Connery set the style of how Bond looked, dressed, made love, smoked (of course Daniel Craig isn't allowed to smoke \u2013 only the doomed bad girl is afforded that luxury), drank, handled a gun, drove a car \u2013 even what type of car he drove. And it's a telling point that the biggest reaction to anything at the showing I went to of <em>Skyfall</em> came on the appearance of the classic Aston Martin. The only thing that would have got a bigger, more satisfied gasp would have been Connery himself showing up. Every Bond since Connery can't help but be compared with him. You can't beat the yardstick.</p> <p><strong>BH</strong> I'll keep my Walther PPK in its holster in the hope my argument is like a brick through a plate-glass window. In fact I absolutely agree that the whole reason we're even discussing this is down to Connery's legendary version of Bond. But that's a different matter. Sure, Connery brilliantly laid the foundation for the 007 we see now, but I do feel Daniel Craig has picked up his pistol, run with it and blasted the whole franchise into a new stratosphere.</p> <p><em>Skyfall</em> itself feels more sophisticated than pretty much any Bond film so far, while retaining the thrills and the jokes. It's the same with Craig \u2013 he's one of the smartest actors out there, more than holding his own with the likes of Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes, but he also has a unique, granite-hewn physicality matched by his smouldering intensity. Craig's Bond exudes single-minded toughness, but we sense, also, the complex psychology of the orphan James, the man who's licensed to kill, but who has deep-seated emotions, too. I just think he now brings more to the role than all his predecessors, even Connery.</p> <p><strong>CH</strong> I agree that Daniel Craig is a terrific actor, and his combination of toughness and vulnerability is superb, but you've made the schoolboy error of thinking that James Bond is a real person. He's not, Boyd, he's a fantasy \u2013 the ultimate fantasy alpha male. Fleming was clever in the books not to burden him with a backstory. He has no domestic life. No wife and kids. We never see him mowing the lawn or doing the washing up. He lives in hotels, eats in restaurants, sleeps with whoever he likes and is allowed to kill people.</p> <p>That's the type of fantasy figure that Connery embodied so effortlessly. It was only in his penultimate novel that Fleming decided to have some fun with Bond's parental-loss backstory, when M writes the famous obituary. But Bond is not required to behave any differently as a result and go all touchy-feely. And besides, are you seriously telling me that Sean Connery couldn't hold his own with Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes? Sean bloody Connery? He'd eat them for breakfast, and none of that silly schoolboy blubbing either.</p> <p><strong>BH</strong> Oh of course Bond is a fantasy. I hope I didn't imply otherwise. But just as Christopher Nolan's magnificent Dark Knight trilogy managed to deepen the fantasy figure of Batman, and add vivid new layers while never skimping on the entertainment value of such an archetypal character, so I believe the three Daniel Craig Bond movies (yes, even <em>Quantum of Solace</em>), but especially the new one, have taken the fantasy and made it somehow seem richer. Craig's Bond might shed the occasional tear, but the incredible thing about his performance is how he still makes sure he's our ultimate fantasy alpha male, as you put it, while actually managing to make us care about him even more (for which the writers deserve a lot of credit, too, by the way). I'm sure Sean bloody Connery is every bit as great a thesp as Daniel blubby touchy-feely Craig; it's just that Craig, backed by some extraordinarily good decision-making by the whole current creative team, has come up with an even more deliciously satisfying version of that Fleming fantasy figure we both love so much.</p> <p><strong>CH</strong> Oh, don't get me started on <em>The Dark Knight</em> (or Batman, as I call him), he's a man in a rubber bat-suit fighting a clown, for God's sake. The concept cannot possibly carry the ponderous weight of glum import that Nolan loads on it. Give me the cheesy fun of the Avengers any day. Not for a moment that I'm advocating a return to <em>Moonraker</em>-era Bond silliness, but I do wish Craig had been allowed to just <em>let rip</em> and go for it a bit more. I want to hear that timeless Bond theme pound out and watch Bond transcend this dull world and take me back to when I was a nine-year-old boy at my local Odeon, enthralled by the magic and the excitement and the romance and the sheer vital sexiness of it all. I like a little light and shade and some seriousness and real jeopardy, even the odd tear, but I also like to see a man strapped to a metal work surface about to be sliced in half by a laser beam, exchanging quips with a fat German who loves only gold.</p> <p><em>Charlie Higson's latest children's book, The Sacrifice, is out now</em></p>",
  "<p>Exeter's Heineken hangover lives on. After failing to crack two of the tougher European nuts, the Devonians ran into West Country rivals who were inspired by more low-key European adventures to play some of the best rugby since the summer sackings and signings. Not that Exeter went down quietly.</p> <p>After 40 minutes of near total control and going 20-8 up with 22 minutes to go, Bath had to scrap for their lives, ending with 14 men when the centre Dan Hipkiss was shown a yellow card for killing the ball and then shown a red card for interfering with play while in the sin bin.</p> <p>However, after lifting the siege with a Stephen Donald penalty in the 79th minute, it was Bath who finished the game hunting for their first try bonus point of the season \u2013 quite something for a team who had managed to cross the line nine times in six previous league games. \"My frustration is not losing the game,\" said Exeter's coach Rob Baxter, \"but failing to stand up in the first half. We were jogging on to the ball. It seemed we were looking for a pretty game of rugby.\"</p> <p>|Bath scored twice in the opening 14 minutes before their inspirational Springbok Francois Louw popped up on the wing for another try midway through that torrid final period. For all their efforts in the final 40 minutes, Exeter had to settle for a score by the replacement fly-half, Ignacio Mieres, and no losing bonus point.</p> <p>While Exeter were suffering at the hands of Leinster, the reigning European champions, and then Clermont Auvergne, one of the favourites to succeed them in the Heineken Cup, Bath had something of an easier fortnight against Bucharest and Agen in the secondary European competition.</p> <p>They also had their Argentine Test wing Horacio Agulla available \u2013 or at least on the bench \u2013 for the first time and the increasing confidence showed in their first move, and score, of the game. After some Exeter pressure Donald applied his particularly muscular style at fly-half, Nick Abendanon showed more silky skills to slide through the visiting midfield and the centre Ben Williams was in the corner.</p> <p>There were signs that Bath are beginning to evolve under the leadership of Gary Gold and his coaching corps, noticeably with Kyle Eastmond having an increasing say in the action. In theory, the former rugby league back lines up on the wing but he was as likely as Donald to act as first receiver and that was how the second try came about. The flanker Louw took the ball on and almost made the Exeter line before Donald found Eastmond outside him with a clear path to the corner.</p> <p>The New Zealander, who is finally making an impression at the Rec now that he is fully fit, landed one of the two conversions and Bath were value for their 12-point lead after 14 minutes, while Exeter still sought to throw off the European hangover. Exeter reduced the lead through the overlapping prop Brett Sturgess but Gareth Steenson missed the conversion and a couple of penalties and Bath's territorial domination continued up to the interval, although a penalty from Donald and a scoreline of 15-5 was all they had to show for their best 40 minutes at the Rec this season.</p>",
  "<p>The glow of survival is still warm when the reminders of how tough it is being Wigan commence. After staying up despite a scaled-down budget, the manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, is courted by other clubs, the bleeding of talent starts and the cycle of what the Spaniard calls \"doing it differently\" begins once again.</p> <p>During the summer Mohamed Diam\u00e9 was tempted away by West Ham, Hugo Rodallega left on a free transfer and Victor Moses, the latest to follow Antonio Valencia and Charles N'Zogbia to bigger and better, was picked up by Chelsea. In the market for a striker, Mart\u00ednez was never going to be able to compete with another newly promoted side, Southampton, for Jay Rodriguez and could not produce an offer strong enough to tempt Crystal Palace to part with Wilfried Zaha.</p> <p>Yet here they are again and it is victories like this, which may be instantly forgotten by neutrals, that will earn them the right to do it all over again next season. \"We knew it was a must-win game and that's always difficult to cope with, it brings expectations,\" Mart\u00ednez said. \"I thought we were really mature.\"</p> <p>The background of the scorers, Iv\u00e1n Ramis and James McArthur, only underlined that making Emmerson Boyce look awesome as a wing-back is only part of \"doing it differently\". Even James Tomkins pulling one back late on could not dent the optimism of the first home win of the season.</p> <p>McArthur, 25, was plucked from that Scottish talent factory Hamilton, who also produced James McCarthy, and his presence in the Wigan starting lineup meant that Diam\u00e9 was only a squad player by the time he decided to move on. The Spanish defender Ramis, 28, who turned West Ham down to move to the DW Stadium in the summer for around \u00a33m in a rare transfer market victory for Wigan, was ridiculed after his woeful debut performance in the 2-0 home defeat to Chelsea on the opening weekend. But now he looks more comfortable in Mart\u00ednez's 3-4-3 system and opened the scoring with a crashing volley to go with his goal in the 4-1 Capital One Cup win at West Ham in September.</p> <p>\"If it had been Robin van Persie we'd be raving about it for ages,\" said the West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce. \"It was brilliant technique and any striker would have been proud of it. We did try to get him but Roberto tipped it with his Spanish.\"</p> <p>Mart\u00ednez enjoyed his moment and said: \"It was a clean contact, a quality strike, a striker's strike. He's already scored against West Ham. He'll have to play against West Ham more often.\"</p> <p>Before the match, Wigan supporter Tom Gill, who was also given the squad number 100 for the day, was presented with a shirt to mark his 100th birthday by the chairman, Dave Whelan, against the loud and incongruous backdrop of Fatboy Slim's Praise You. Despite himself, Gill was probably still humming the alien tune when Ramis crashed in a volley from Jean Beausejour's corner to put the hosts in front after seven minutes.</p> <p>West Ham were restricted to direct and straight balls up to Andy Carroll, who constantly moaned at his treatment from Gary Caldwell. When the England striker was able to bring down one such clearance, his neat flick gave Kevin Nolan the space to produce a shot that was held by Ali al-Habsi.</p> <p>Wigan showed ruthlessness once again to pull further ahead when Shaun Maloney failed to control Beausejour's cross and McArthur thumped in. As the visitors piled forward in added time, Maynor Figueroa turned a Tomkins effort on to the bar but the West Ham defender headed in from George McCartney's cross. Fittingly, Diam\u00e9, utterly vanquished by McCarthy, had already been withdrawn.</p> <p>Allardyce added: \"It was a shock and disappointment to see us perform that badly after the start we've had. As a newly promoted team you have to give your very best to have a chance of winning away from home.\"</p>",
  "<p>Reading's wait for a first Premier League win of the season goes on but there was a collective sense of relief and renewed determination in these parts after a late strike from Hal Robson-Kanu rescued a point for the hosts in a game of startling late drama.</p> <p>Three goals in the last five minutes of play swung the contest this way and that, and at the end of it all, after everyone had regained their breath, Reading could reflect on a draw that sees them remain in the relegation zone but shows they at least have the stomach for the stern challenge of ensuring they do not slip out of the top flight at the first time of asking.</p> <p>For Fulham there was little else but frustration. The visitors appeared to have secured the victory that would have seen them climb into the top four when Dimitar Berbatov gave them the lead for the second time in the match with a low right-foot shot on 88 minutes, but Martin Jol's men could not hold on and allowed Robson-Kanu, on as a substitute, to sweep home after Fulham's defence had failed to clear Nicky Shorey's free-kick. The collective angst in the visitors' ranks was obvious, particularly so as similar careless defending had allowed another substitute, Garath McCleary, to get Reading back to 2-2 only five minutes earlier.</p> <p>\"There was no purpose to our game in the first half, but the second half was a different story,\" Jol said. \"We had good movement, created chances, and if you score three goals against a team like Reading you should win. I thought it [Berbatov's goal] was the winner. A couple of weeks ago we did the same thing against Southampton \u2013 they scored in the final minute. Maybe we need to be more clever.\"</p> <p>That could be perceived to be a harsh judgment given Fulham sit sixth, only a point behind the Champions League places, and having performed this season with an impressive level of composure and class.</p> <p>Indeed they have now scored as many goals, 19, as the leaders Chelsea and will remain a threat to most sides should Berbatov continue to put in such high-level displays. The Bulgarian was his typical languid self here, barely breaking out of walking pace at times, but his control and movement of possession from an unusually deep position was captivating and a constant threat.</p> <p>Bryan Ruiz also shone having come on as a 58th-minute substitute, putting Fulham on level terms with a rasping, dipping shot from the edge of the area just after the hour mark. It was from his 77th-minute corner that Chris Baird made it 2-1 with a near-post header, the midfielder's second goal in two games, and at that stage it appeared Fulham were to be rewarded for an energetic and positive second-half display having, as Jol stated, lacked purpose before the break.</p> <p>During that period it had been Reading who played with more intent and, after the former Fulham striker Pavel Pogrebnyak had missed with a close-range header, they took the lead on 26 minutes through Mikele Leigertwood's precise right-foot shot from outside the area. The hosts were required to show even more thrust during the dramatic closing stages.</p> <p>\"I thought we were going to win at the end,\" said Brian McDermott, whose side remain without a clean sheet as well as a victory this season. \"But at 3-2 down, with the clock ticking, I guess you have to take the point.</p> <p>\"People will talk about the [first] win but we just have to keep playing the game. I'm proud of the group, they deserve a lot of respect for what they've achieved and I have no doubt they'll get that win soon enough. We're going to be OK.\"</p>",

He said they were worried because at their peak they had \"never asked for anybody's birth certificate\" while living a hedonistic lifestyle in which young girls threw themselves at them.</p> <p>Roffey said: \"There is obviously much greater awareness of paedophilia today but in the 1960s everyone knew about the age of consent and people were regularly tried for breaking the law over it. The fact that someone may have looked 16 or 21 if they were male may be mitigation but it is no defence.\"</p> <p>Paedophilia became a subject of national concern in the 1970s as it emerged as a civil rights issue. In 1974, paedophiles set up the Paedophile Information Exchange to lobby for the abolition of the age of consent and to oppose the banning of child pornography. The group operated openly until 1978 when the police arrested and charged some of its members. The group was the subject of newspaper expos\u00e9s and criticism by campaigners including Mary Whitehouse.</p> <p>On Friday, Clifford said young pop stars at the time had gone from working in a factory one week to performing in front of thousands of people, \"and girls are screaming and throwing themselves at them then\".</p> <p>He told LBC radio: \"I am hoping that the real predators are the ones we are going to find out about: the Glitters of this world, the Saviles of this world, not people that were randy young pop stars in the 1960s, 70s and 80s even, that had women throwing themselves at them everywhere they went, because that is a whole different area and a whole different situation. No one had heard the word paedophile in those days, the 60s and 70s,\" he said.</p> <p>\"They never asked for anybody's birth certificate and they were young lads \u2026 suddenly everyone's dream was a reality.We are talking about a lot of people that were huge names in the 60s and 70s and a lot of them barely remember what they did last week, genuinely. For them to try and recount what happened in a dressing room in 1965 or 1968 or 1972, genuinely they are frightened to death.\"</p> <p>Roffey remains unimpressed by such special pleading. \"You don't need a birth certificate to realise the age of a girl even if she looks older than her age. People invariably know they are breaking the law and they still know now,\" he said.</p> <p>Clifford's comments came as it emerged that the Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichol, has written to the Pope to ask him to consider removing Savile's papal knighthood in recognition of the distress caused to his victims.</p> <p>Scotland Yard is leading the current investigation into accusations of abuse by the former BBC DJ and presenter Savile, which now involves around 300 possible victims.</p> <p>Officers have searched a cottage belonging to Savile in Allt na Reigh in Glencoe, Scotland, to look for \"any evidence of any others being involved in any offending with him\".</p> <p>In Leeds, members of Savile's family issued a statement expressing their bewilderment at his crimes and their sympathy for his victims. In the statement, the family said their \"thoughts\" and \"prayers\" were with those who had suffered abuse.</p>",
  "<p>News that a fatal disease has landed on British soil understandably causes alarm. Today, the disease in question \u2013 <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> \u2013 threatens trees, not humans, but it's a sign of the esteem in which we hold our ash trees that the alarm bells have been so loud. This could be like Dutch elm disease all over again, an unstoppable plague that transforms the countryside.</p> <p>As someone who manages a 10-acre woodland in Somerset, I've always thought that <em>Fraxinus excelsior</em>, our native ash, is the most magnificent specimen in the woods. It's beautiful, with a smooth, honey-coloured bark and a clean, white wood. Its delicate, pinnate leaves let in the light and the tree is useful for almost anything: it's both strong and elastic, so we use it for making all sorts of furniture, anything from chairs to four-poster beds. Ash can be used to make snooker cues, tennis rackets, hockey sticks and oars. It's also the finest firewood: as the old saying goes, \"ash wet or ash dry, a king shall warm his slippers by\". In both Greek and Norse mythology humans were made from it. Odin was speared to an ash \u2013 the mythical Yggdrasil. Ash was used both for the symbolically important maypole and the Yule log.</p> <p>For the last three years, since we set up our woodland shelter for people in crisis, we've been thinning out the willow, hazel and hawthorn to give more space and light to our ashes. Believing the old planter's proverb \u2013 that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the next best time is now, we've added 200 ashes in various clearings. We've protected the coppice against deer.</p> <p>So the news that they're now endangered fills me with melancholy and something close to fear: when you heat your house and your water with wood, ash is your oil. And when the ashes are the tallest trees in the woodland, they're your canopy, your roof. It's as if someone had told you that, pretty soon, your fuel will run out and your tiles will disintegrate.</p> <p>The government's reaction to the crisis has been flat-footed. A disease <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/07/disease-killing-denmarks-ash-trees\" title=\"\">that had affected 90% of the ash trees in Denmark</a> was first noticed here eight months ago: in Buckinghamshire, Leicester, Scotland, Yorkshire and County Durham. There were links to imported saplings. Last week was simply the first time the dreaded disease had been witnessed in mature trees rather than nursery stock.</p> <p>So for eight months nothing has happened. A ban should have been imposed on imported ash saplings immediately. Bear in mind that this pathogen was first discovered in Poland in 1992. It's not as if we haven't had time to act. It's the sylvan equivalent of knowing about HIV/Aids, but forgetting to advise about condoms.</p> <p>This is the umpteenth time the countryside has felt aggrieved by metropolitan policymakers. In recent years, the squires of the countryside have been dismayed by the ban on foxhunting, a piece of legislation which put wind in the Countryside Alliance's sails. They've been infuriated by politicians lacking the <em>cojones</em> to cull badgers and have also been appalled that their incomes are dwindling as costs rise. Milk prices are just the most recent example of hard-working farmers being screwed. Our bees are dying out, either because of the weather or the varroa mite. The cost of feeding our pigs has increased 25% in two years. Even urban visitors to the shires recognise that the government's idea of selling off a third of the Forestry Commission's 1.85m acres was barmy; and that cutting the commission's budget by 25% would drastically reduce its ability to combat this catastrophe.</p> <p>Rising fuel prices also affect rural areas unduly; mobile reception and broadband coverage is patchy; access to public transport and other services is often woeful. This year has also seen the worst harvest for a generation. It's understandable that rural residents feel hard done by.</p> <p>Our instinct is to blame politicians. Many feel our metropolitan MPs inevitably have a blind spot when it comes to the countryside. In a democracy in which 90% of the electorate live in urban areas, they're bound to. \"The countryside,\" says Jonathan Dimbleby, a former president of the <a href=\"http://www.cpre.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Campaign to Protect Rural England</a>, \"is a second-level problem for politicians. Over the last 20 or 30 years they've concentrated so much on the urban environment that they only wake up to the countryside when it becomes a problem.\"</p> <p>Of course us agriculturalists will always moan. As the English humorist AP Herbert wrote:</p> <p><em>The Farmer will never be happy again;</em><br><em>He carries his heart in his boots;</em><br><em> For either the rain is destroying his grain</em><br><em>Or the drought is destroying his roots. </em></p> <p>If we're honest, we should be grateful for the huge subsidies and grants that have come our way in recent times. Our woodland is a tiny operation, but we have received a few thousand quid to create a 5,000-gallon pond, plant 450 trees and control Japanese knotweed.</p> <p>And yet anyone who lives in a rural area still feels there's something wrong in the representation of the countryside as somewhere to \"escape\" to. Television offers a deeply sentimentalised view of it, an idyll where stress is replaced by serenity. For most people it's not, then, a place of toil and blisters, but the backdrop for weekend recreation: it's where daytrippers go for walks, see birds, or shoot birds, enjoy stately homes and roaring fires. For most Brits, the countryside is a pleasurable museum, not a tough place to live.</p> <p>In other countries it's different. France has its mythical \"France <em>profonde</em>\", the deep soul of the nation that resists urban fashions. In Italy, Sicily was known as the \"granary of Rome\" and, even now, the country's beloved pasta is provided by native wheat fields. America has its corn belt and even elected a peanut farmer, Jimmy Carter, as president.</p> <p>In other nations it just seems as if rural labourers are a vital niche of the electorate. That, perhaps, is why no British politician that I can remember has ever spoken so clearly to the farming community as Eisenhower did when he said, parodying bureaucrats: \"Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil, and you're a thousand miles from the cornfield.\"</p> <p>The problem is perhaps historical: we were the first industrialised nation and our ancestors left the land in such large numbers that, even now, the terms \"agricultural\" or \"a bit village\" are easy insults. The idiot in any Shakespearean production always has a Somerset accent.</p> <p>Britain was the first global superpower, meaning that long before we became obsessive foodies, we already had exotic tastes for foreign foods and timbers. Sugar, tobacco, tea and mahogany became commonplace. The reason the UK imports 42% of its food isn't just because we're a crowded island, it's because we insist on eating what our climate can't accommodate.</p> <p>The result is a complete lack of connection between what's on our plates and what's in our fields. And I'll bet my fine breeding sow, Harriet, the chair you're sitting on to read this isn't made from native timber. If it's wooden at all, chances are it's from the forests of Russia or Poland that supply Ikea.</p> <p>We want everything to be cheap, whether it's furniture or milk. That's understandable, but there's a hidden cost. I remember when I was buying those 200 ash saplings, a woodsman warned me not to save a few quid by buying from a nursery that imported them from Hungary. \"Never know what might come in,\" he said, looking suspicious. At the time, I thought his comment was the woodland equivalent of racism, but I did as he advised. At a marginally increased cost, I bought all our saplings from a nursery that guaranteed British provenance.</p> <p>I assumed the woodsman was mildly ignorant. In fact, he was very wise \u2013 because it's absurd that we've been importing ash saplings when they regenerate so prolifically from our 18m UK specimens. From tomorrow, Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, will introduce a ban on imports, but it's far too late. The disease is here and spreading. Fifty thousand ashes have already been burnt.

  "<p>Imran Khan, the former Pakistan cricket captain turned politician, was taken off an international flight from Canada to New York and questioned by US immigration officials over his views on drone strikes and jihad.</p> <p>Khan, who has been at the forefront of a high-profile campaign as leader of the Pakistan Movement for Justice party (PTI) to end US drone strikes in northern Pakistan, had been in Canada to give a speech and was on his way to a fundraising dinner in the US on Friday.</p> <p>Khan recently attempted to lead a high-profile march into south Waziristan which included US peace activists from the Code Pink group with some 15,000 of his supporters.</p> <p>He claims that the drone strikes kill large numbers of innocent civilians \u2013 a claim denied by the US.</p> <p>\"I was taken off from plane and interrogated by US Immigration in Canada on my views on drones. My stance is known. Drone attacks must stop,\" Khan tweeted yesterday after his questioning.</p> <p>He added: \"Missed flight and sad to miss the fundraising lunch in NY but nothing will change my stance.\"</p> <p>A US state department spokeswoman confirmed Khan's questioning. \"We are aware that Imran Khan was briefly delayed in Toronto before boarding the next flight to the United States,\" she told Pakistani media.</p> <p>\"The issue was resolved. Mr Khan is welcome in the United States.\"</p> <p>US immigration authorities refused to comment on Khan's case but a spokeswoman quoted by the Toronto Sun newspaper said: \"Our dual mission is to facilitate travel in the United States while we secure our borders, our people, and our visitors from those that would do us harm like terrorists and terrorist weapons, criminals, and contraband,\" said CBP spokesman Joanne Ferreira.</p> <p>\"Under US immigration law, applicants for admission bear the burden of proof to establish that they are clearly eligible to enter the United States. In order to demonstrate that they are admissible, the applicant must overcome all grounds of inadmissibility.\"</p> <p>Some Canadian commentators have speculated that Khan's questioning was because of groups who have been protesting his visit to the US, including a group called the American Islamic Leadership Coalition which reportedly wrote to US secretary of state Hillary Clinton asking her to revoke the US visa granted to Khan.</p> <p>\"The US embassy made a significant error in granting this Islamist leader a visa,\" the group said in a statement.</p> <p>\"Granting individuals like Khan access to the US to fundraise is against the interest of the people of Pakistan and the national security interests of the US.\"</p> <p>Ali Zaidi, an official in Khan's party demanded \"a prompt and thorough inquiry into this sordid episode\" and \"an unconditional apology from the US government\".</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79NMs98-keI\" title=\"\">video</a> is a peculiar affair: a portly figure, heavily bearded, inspects his Islamist fighters in the northern Malian desert. Taken at the beginning of the year and posted on YouTube, much of the 12 or so minutes is taken up with prayer, interspersed with shots of fighters attacking the small garrison at Aguelhok and shots of dead soldiers.</p> <p>The man pictured is Iyad Ag Ghaly \u2013 nicknamed \"the strategist\" \u2013 the Tuareg Islamist leader of Ansar Dine, the \"defenders of the faith\". It is this man's actions in the coming weeks that might determine whether there is a foreign-led intervention in Mali against him and his allies \u2013 al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Mujao (the Movement for Openness and Jihad in West Africa).</p> <p>Earlier this year it was the alliance of these three groups \u2013 Ansar Dine, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Mujao \u2013 that captured large parts of Mali's north, including the cities of Kidal, Timbuktu and Gao. Since then, they have imposed an unpopular and extreme interpretation of sharia law that has seen stonings, amputations and the destruction of shrines.</p> <p>With the growing threat of an African Union-led intervention to retake the north, backed by the European Union and the US, the quixotic figure of Ag Ghaly has emerged as the focus of attempts to avoid a wider conflict by persuading him to swap sides.</p> <p>Last week, as a delegation from the rival Tuareg National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) was in Paris to press its case, it emerged that discussions are focusing increasingly on Ag Ghaly. It is perhaps not surprising, given his record. For while Ag Ghaly has worked hard to reinvent himself as a hardline Islamist leader, it was not always the case for a man long noted for his fondness for whisky and music. As a leaked US embassy cable suggested, Ag&#xa0;Ghaly has a reputation for self-interest, describing how he had long sought to \"play both sides \u2026 to maximise his personal gain\".</p> <p>The complicated tribal politics of northern Mali and the Sahel region have long set both rival tribes and competing social groups against each other. As the author of the leaked US cable in 2008 observed, what that meant in the 1990s was an \"alphabet soup\" of nationalist groups with different tribal attachments in an area the size of France, including, more recently, al-Qaida affiliates with financial interests in kidnapping and smuggling.</p> <p>All that changed with the destabilising influence of the war in Libya that led to a flood of weapons into Mali, a military coup in the capital, Bamako, and the rebellion in the north, led first by the MNLA, a new group in which Ag Ghaly had sought a leadership role but had been rebuffed. The response of the quietly spoken tribal \"aristocrat\", say analysts, was to set up Ansar Dine as a rival group, forming an alliance of convenience with al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Mujao. It was a split that came to a head in March, when Ag Ghaly's rival rebels accused him of undermining the cause with his Islamist proclamations, calling him a \"criminal\" who wanted to found a \"theocratic state\".</p> <p>In evidence to the US House foreign affairs committee earlier this year, Rudolph Atallah of the Atlantic Council, who has spent much time in northern Mali, said Ag Ghaly's split with other Tuareg leaders to found Ansar Dine meant Mali was \"becoming a magnet for foreign fighters, who are flocking in to train recruits to use sophisticated weapons, built for and taken from [Muammar] Gaddafi's arsenal\".</p> <p>Ag Ghaly was born into a noble family in the Ifogha tribal group, who come from the Kidal region in the north. He travelled to Libya as a young man and joined Gaddafi's Islamic Legion, composed of exiles from the Sahel, whom Gaddafi used as cannon fodder in his conflict with Chad. He returned to Mali in 1990 to join the Tuareg uprising as a leader, later acting as a negotiator between the Malian government and the rebels.</p> <p>His interest in the fundamentalist Salafist branch of Islam emerged, according to a profile in the French magazine <em>L'Express</em>, at the end of the 1990s, when he encountered Pakistani practitioners in Kidal at the same time as he was emerging as an intermediary for Islamist kidnappers, a profitable business from which he took a cut of the ransom. Ag Ghaly's contacts with the Islamists who would later form the core of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb were strengthened by the fact that a \"cousin\" was a leader of one of the groups.</p> <p>Ag Ghaly also managed to maintain a working relationship with the former Malian president, Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9, persuading him to post him as the envoy to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, a closeness that was behind his rejection as a leader by rebels in the MNLA.</p> <p>Now, however, Ag Ghaly is facing his greatest challenge. The lightning success of Islamist gains in Mali's north has gone down badly with many in the region. In a grand tour of the north to build support he was rebuffed by tribal leaders.</p> <p>Other reports \u2013 impossible to verify \u2013 have suggested that even in his own fiefdom of Kidal his imposition of sharia law has proved deeply unpopular and he is running short of cash, while his group is suffering defections.</p> <p>A UN security council resolution has authorised the formation of an African Union-led military expedition to recapture the north, while France, Germany and the US have offered logistical assistance. Algeria, which had been resisting any intervention, said that it would accept it as a \"last resort\" as long as it did not set foot on Algerian soil in hunting fighters.</p> <p>Patrick Smith of the <em>Africa Confidential</em> newsletter, who was in Paris after the MNLA delegation, believes Ag Ghaly will be offered a choice. \"There's a growing desire to reach out to him to say you can ally with us and help work out a deal for a decentralised north. If not, it's war and you'll end up on a list with other al-Qaida-associated leaders wondering when a drone is coming for you.\"</p> <p>Smith, like other analysts, believes that Ag Ghaly is more interested in power than founding a \"theocratic state\" in Mali. \"When he was manoeuvring for a leadership position in the MNLA there was no question of a theocratic state.\"</p> <p>Another western analyst said: \"Iyad Ag Ghaly is regarded as a big man, a pragmatist who is willing to do deals.\"</p> <p>John Campbell, a Mali watcher at the US Council on Foreign Relations, doubts there will be conflict, despite the drumbeats suggesting an imminent military intervention. He believes that a negotiation is more likely, at least involving Ag&#xa0;Ghaly and his followers. \"I think the way forward is political dialogue.\"</p> <p>Most, however, accept that, even if Ag Ghaly is persuaded to talk, and split from al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in exchange for more autonomy for the north, that would still leave the issue of al-Qaida and its foreign fighters, including Algerians and Sudanese. The Algerian decision to accept that a military intervention may be inevitable, after weeks of diplomatic pressure from France, might just be the leverage to persuade the Tuareg leader to change his mind.</p>",
  "<p>When you pick up the day's newspaper, it is not likely that you will find much coverage of the ongoing popular revolt in Bahrain. But on the off chance that Bahrain is mentioned, it is almost certain that two words will jump at you: Sunni and Shia. It is even more likely you will see some mention of a Shia revolt against a Sunni monarchy.</p> <p>This is unfortunate; a very complicated situation is expediently packaged into a soundbite-like myth. That narrative is ahistorical and dangerous because, like all myths, there is a grain of truth to it.</p> <p>Last year, when Bahrain's revolution began, it was not about sects. Sunnis, Shia along with Bahrain's \"sushis\" (people of mixed background), non-Muslims, atheists; all came together in Bahrain's version of Tahrir \u2013 Pearl Square. Their unifying demand was for a constitutional monarchy to be established in Bahrain. The people were demanding that the king honour his lofty reform promises made when he inherited the position from his Emir father.</p> <p>This was the third act in a struggle predating the so-called Arab spring. It had started in the 1990s when the people of Bahrain had their own uprising largely forgotten in the west. Then, their demand was a return to Bahrain's more democratic 1973 constitution that gave people a real parliament. Instead, thousands of citizens were arrested and imprisoned. Dozens were killed, many under torture.</p> <p>In 1999 that cycle was interrupted as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamad_bin_Isa_Al_Khalifa\" title=\"\">Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa</a> inherited power from his late father amid soaring hopes of reconciliation and reform. His first act was to announce a referendum promising to establish a constitutional monarchy.</p> <p>Initially, the people celebrated Hamad's break with his repressive father's legacy as many voted in favour of the referendum. They were encouraged by the release of all political prisoners, and the return of political exiles back to Bahrain, and a halt of state-sanctioned torture.</p> <p>In 2002, borrowing a page from Napoleon Bonaparte's playbook, \"Hamad the Reformer\" engineered his own monarchic putsch. He amended the constitution, granting himself absolute unchecked powers. A rubber-stamp parliament was then created \u2013 half appointed by him and the other half \"elected\", but with no legislative or monitoring powers.</p> <p>The farce extended to elections as electoral districts were set up to prevent the opposition from ever making significant gains. As a result, if the leading opposition group got 60% of all votes, the new re-districting made it so that they would win only 18 out of 40 seats in the parliament. These measures were at the heart of a comprehensive effort to marginalise and discriminate against the country's majority population: Shia Muslims.</p> <p>Bahrain's unwritten laws insidiously establish a quasi-apartheid regime preventing Shias from state-owned housing and many government jobs. For instance, there are entire areas like Riffaa, where Shia are not allowed to rent, buy homes or land.</p> <p>Ironically, the country's largest employer is none other than the interior ministry and the security forces in charge of protecting the regime. Shia Muslims who, according to the latest numbers provided are about 70% of the population, are not allowed to be employed in them. They justify this through what Bahrainis call \"political naturalisation\".</p> <p>For two decades, tens of thousands of people from places like Syria, Jordan, Yemen and Pakistan were expediently granted citizenship in Bahrain. All of them are Sunnis.</p> <p>The regime is thus resolving two problems. A short-term need is filling the security services with politically reliable elements beholden to the monarchy and not to the nation. The long-term goal is to artificially shift the country's demographics: diluting the Shia majority.</p> <p>Consequently, newly built government houses go to the politically naturalised, while a regular Bahraini family (Sunni or Shia) has to wait up to 20 years to receive housing. Many Bahrainis sit at home unemployed, while politically naturalised people receive a job immediately upon arrival.</p> <p>These policies are not fortuitous but part of a deliberate attempt to foment sectarian tensions in society, and to play on the region's geopolitical and sectarian fault lines.</p> <p>In the past, Bahrain's opposition was \"Nasser-socialists before they were dubbed communists\". Today they are regarded as Iranian agents and terrorists.</p> <p>Aided by more than 13 different European and American public relations companies at times, the regime aims to turn its blatant repression into a net asset by capitalising on the fear of the enemy <em>du jour</em>: Shia Iran. At the end of the day the fact remains the same: you can be Shia and loyal to the regime, like Sameera Rajab who is minister of information; and you can be Sunni, sentenced by a military court, tortured and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/bahrain-condemned-activists-lose-appeal\" title=\"\">serving time in prison, like Ebrahim Sharif</a>.</p> <p>Next time you pick up a newspaper remember that the sectarian Shia-versus-Sunni narrative only serves Bahrain's tyrants. That is, of course, if Bahrain is written about at all.</p>",

The 42-year-old Florida lawyer is in a crucial swing state and thus represents what is emerging as a decisive factor in America's 2012 election \u2013 the female voters set to determine the race for the White House.</p> <p>As the bitter contest enters its final week, President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney are neck-and-neck and their campaigners are now doing everything they can to persuade voters that their party would best serve women's interests.</p> <p>Television ads appeal directly to them; at campaign stops both Obama and Romney speak about them; and surrogates from Bill Clinton to Cindy McCain are wheeled out to tout for their support. Yet Obama has seen a strong lead among women almost disappear, making it feasible that they might vote on 6 November to put a Republican back in the Oval Office.</p> <p>That is certainly what Shaw wants to see. \"I think Obama has been an abysmal failure. He's done nothing for people like me,\" she said at a campaign stop in the central Florida town of Winter Park, where Romney's spouse, Ann, was holding a rally. Shaw said she had been largely out of work for the last four years, as had her husband, an estate agent. That, she said, was more than enough to make her want Obama to lose. \"If Romney wins, I think there will be an economic uptick. It would be not be overnight, but the economy will be finally moving forward,\" she said.</p> <p>That sort of sentiment is a nightmare to the Obama team. For months the Democrats have enjoyed a huge lead among women. It helped them weather much of Romney's rise after Obama's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate.</p> <p>Now there are signs that this usually solid bulwark of support is crumbling. A poll last week from AP-GfK had Obama and Romney level among women at 47 points each. Only a month ago the same survey had Obama ahead by 16 points. The average of the overall national polls has Romney edging into a two-point lead. \"Obama must do very well with women voters or not get a second term,\" said Professor Robert Watson, an expert in American studies at Lynn University in Florida.</p> <p>Some experts believe the Democrats have made a strategic mistake. Over the summer the Obama campaign leaped on a series of gaffes by Republican politicians and conservative commentators, such as radio host Rush Limbaugh, on abortion, rape and reproductive rights.</p> <p>Democrats touted a \"Republican war on women\" as one of the main planks of their campaign and seemed destined to tighten their hold on the female vote. But now it seems that a simple fact has been overlooked: in a struggling economy, women voters will put concern over jobs first. One study showed that, of the 2.6m jobs created since the recession ended, 80% have gone to men. \"The Democrats played up social issues and thought they were going to coast to victory,\" said Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University. \"Now Democrats have to spin the social issues back to the economy.\"</p> <p>Yet that territory is one the Republicans have been owning for months. Romney and his running mate, the firebrand Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, have hammered home their argument that Obama has failed to stimulate the economy or significantly reduce the suffering of those hit by joblessness. The AP poll, for example, showed 51% thought Romney would do a better job of managing the economy, compared with 44% for Obama.</p> <p>That was the message Ann Romney was pumping out in Winter Park. Though the town, near Orlando, is one of the most upmarket in the state, with its leafy streets lined with expensive bistros, the image Romney painted was of an America on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>\"Like you, we have friends and neighbours that are suffering in this economy,\" she told the predominantly female crowd. \"We're going to get it right this time, and we're going to make sure in November that we make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States.\"</p> <p>Of course, the Obama campaign is far from dead. His team still expects to win, both with women voters and overall. Speaking to journalists last week, Obama's top political adviser, David Axelrod, was full of confident bluster, even offering a $10,000 bet to reporters that Romney could not explain how he plans to balance the ballooning deficit. \"We feel strongly that we have the winning hand,\" he said. \"Governor Romney will take us back to the foreign policy of the 1980s, the social policy of the 1950s and the economic policy of the 1920s.\"</p> <p>That sort of language works with some women, warning of a reversal of social rights, such as abortion, that have been hard won. \"Those issues are very important to me,\" said Mary Faso, 61, an academic at Broward College in Davie, Florida, where Michelle Obama was speaking. \"It matters a lot to me and to a lot of the young people here. Romney on these matters is scary.\"</p> <p>Faso was in a crowd of 2,000 who had packed into a sports hall to listen to the first lady. The audience full of women listened intently as she warned of the dire consequences of a Romney win and listed her husband's achievements. \"When it comes to understanding the lives of women, when it comes to standing up for our rights and opportunities, we know my husband will always have our backs.\"</p> <p>There has been a clear distinction between the camps. During the Democrats' convention in North Carolina \u2013 a swing state that many experts think is likely to fall to Romney \u2013 the party touted its passing of the Lilly Ledbetter law, which helps get equal pay for women. Obama and his supporters also sell his healthcare reforms as a way of helping women.</p> <p>But neither that, nor the Republicans' repeated gaffes over rape and abortion, have halted the Romney rise in the last three weeks. In a swath of swing states, from Colorado, to New Hampshire, the polls have narrowed dramatically. Most of them are evenly split with barely a glimmer of daylight between the candidates. \"It is very close. That is why the fight over the female vote has now become so important,\" said Professor Bruce Gronbeck, a political scientist at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>Most people expect ground zero of the election to be Ohio. No Republican candidate has won the White House without achieving victory in that midwestern state that combines a stretch of \"rust belt\" along its northern coast, rural farmland around the capital Columbus and a heavily Republican southern border with Kentucky. If Obama can stop Romney in Ohio, so the Democrat argument goes, then the Romney advance will be blocked and Obama will win re-election. The latest polls there vary from calling the race a tie to having Obama up by five points.</p> <p>For the moment, that is grounds for Axelrod to keep expressing his confidence. \"This race has settled into exactly where we thought we would be. It is the race we prepared for,\" he said. \"We will know who is bluffing and who isn't [on election day] and I'm looking forward to it.\"</p> <p>Such bravado is increasingly rare on both sides as attitudes across America harden and the still undecided voters become harder to find. One such is Daniel Snow, a 28-year-old estate agent who moved from Romney's home state of Massachusetts to Florida a year ago. He voted for Obama in 2008 but now is unsure whom he will back. He was not a fan of Romney's period in charge of Massachusetts but nor does he feel Obama has fulfilled his potential.</p> <p>\"I voted for Obama four years ago. I don't regret my decision, but I did not see the change that I thought I would,\" he said, explaining he had come to see Michelle Obama speak in Davie to \"get some more information\" that would help him make a choice. Snow was a rare male figure at the event; as the election hits the closing stages, it is women who are centre stage.</p> <p>Commentators and statisticians have tried to come up with a term for them this year. They have been dubbed \"waitress moms\" or \"Walmart moms\" who are not college-educated and earn relatively low wages. Each side has devoted much attention to getting its women supporters to the polls. \"All this hard work and progress: it's all on the line, it's all at stake this November,\" said Michelle Obama in Davie. Meanwhile, in Winter Park, Ann Romney was busy thanking the hundreds of women who turned out to express their support. Standing under a Women for Mitt banner, she boasted of her 18 grandchildren and told the overwhelmingly female crowd: \"We need you to get out there.\"</p> <p>Yet, for all the attention now focused on them, some female voters say the equation is actually simple. They do not like being singled out as a demographic, when they represent the majority of the electorate. Nor do they appreciate such things as abortion being pitched as \"women's issues\" that will solely decide their allegiance.</p> <p>\"Obama says that Romney has a war on women. I don't agree with that,\" said Shaw. \"By saying that, he says that all women are concerned about is birth control and abortion. It demeans us. It says we don't have a brain,\" she said. Shaw says she has other, more pressing concerns when it comes to an election that is now just over a week away.</p> <p>They have nothing to do with her sex, instead reflecting the deep and abiding economic woes that still mark the American electorate. \"We haven't lost our home, but so many people I have worked with have lost everything,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>If you were born before 27 October 1962, Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov saved your life. It was the most dangerous day in history. An American spy plane had been shot down over Cuba while another U2 had got lost and strayed into Soviet airspace. As these dramas ratcheted tensions beyond breaking point, an American destroyer, the USS Beale, began to drop depth charges on the B-59, a Soviet submarine armed with a nuclear weapon.</p> <p>The captain of the B-59, Valentin Savitsky, had no way of knowing that the depth charges were non-lethal \"practice\" rounds intended as warning shots to force the B-59 to surface. The Beale was joined by other US destroyers who piled in to pummel the submerged B-59 with more explosives. The exhausted Savitsky assumed that his submarine was doomed and that world war three had broken out. He ordered the B-59's ten kiloton nuclear torpedo to be prepared for firing. Its target was the USS Randolf, the giant aircraft carrier leading the task force.</p> <p>If the B-59's torpedo had vaporised the Randolf, the nuclear clouds would quickly have spread from sea to land. The first targets would have been Moscow, London, the airbases of East Anglia and troop concentrations in Germany. The next wave of bombs would have wiped out \"economic targets\", a euphemism for civilian populations \u2013 more than half the UK population would have died. Meanwhile, the Pentagon's SIOP, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Integrated_Operational_Plan\" title=\"\">Single Integrated Operational Plan</a> \u2013 a doomsday scenario that echoed <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/\" title=\"\">Dr Strangelove</a>'s orgiastic G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung \u2013 would have hurled 5,500 nuclear weapons against a thousand targets, including ones in non-belligerent states such as Albania and China.</p> <p>What would have happened to the US itself is uncertain. The very reason that Khrushchev sent missiles to Cuba was because the Soviet Union lacked a credible long range <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile\" title=\"\">ICBM</a> deterrent against a possible US attack. It seems likely that America would have suffered far fewer casualties than its European allies. The fact that Britain and western Europe were regarded by some in the Pentagon as expendable pawn sacrifices was the great unmentionable of the cold war.</p> <p>Fifty years on, what lessons can be drawn from the Cuban missile crisis? One is that governments lose control in a crisis. The worst nightmare for US defence secretary Robert McNamara was the unauthorised launch of a nuclear weapon. McNamara ordered that PAL locks (Permissive Action Links) be fitted to all ICBMs. But when the PALs were installed, the Strategic Air Command had all the codes set to 00000000 so that the locks would not impede a quick launch in a crisis. Nuclear weapons security will always be a human issue \u2013 at all levels. On one occasion, Jimmy Carter, the sanest of US presidents, left nuclear launch codes in his suit when it was sent to the dry cleaners.</p> <p>The cold war has ended, but the thermo-nuclear infrastructures of the US and Russia are still in place. And the risk of a nuclear exchange between the superpowers remains very real. In 1995 Russian early warning radar mistook a Norwegian weather rocket for a ballistic missile launched from an American submarine. An emergency signal was sent to President Yeltsin's \"Cheget\", the nuclear suitcase with launch codes. Yeltsin, presumably with vodka close at hand, had less than five minutes to make a decision on a retaliatory strike.</p> <p>\"As long as nuclear weapons exist, the chances of survival of the human species are quite slight.\" Every study of long-term risk analysis supports Noam Chomsky's claim. Ploughshares estimates there are 19,000 warheads in the world today, 18,000 of which are in the hands of the US and Russia. Whatever the exact numbers, the American/Russian nuclear arsenals are the only ones capable of totally destroying all human life. As security analysts <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n04/campbell-craig/whos-in-whos-out\" title=\"\">Campbell Craig and Jan Ruzicka point out</a>: \"Why should Iran or North Korea respect non-proliferation when the most powerful states lecturing them possess such enormous arsenals?\"</p> <p>Most of all, the Cuban missile crisis showed that the weapons themselves are the problem. Britain is now in pole position to lead a \"nuclear disarmament race\". In a 2009 letter to the Times, Field Marshal Lord Bramall and Generals Lord Ramsbotham and Sir Hugh Beach denounced Trident as \"completely useless\". Ditching the system may be a no-brainer for the generals, but not for politicians afraid of a public opinion that equates nuclear weapons with vague notions of \"being strong\". And yet getting rid of Trident would gift the Treasury a windfall of more than \u00a325bn \u2013 enough to finance a million affordable homes.</p> <p>The decision not to start world war three was not taken in the Kremlin or the White House, but in the sweltering control room of a submarine. The launch of the B-59's nuclear torpedo required the consent of all three senior officers aboard. Arkhipov was alone in refusing permission. It is certain that Arkhipov's reputation was a key factor in the control room debate. The previous year the young officer had exposed himself to severe radiation in order to save a submarine with an overheating reactor. That radiation dose eventually contributed to his death in 1998. So when we raise our glasses on 27 October we can only toast his memory. Thank you, Vasya.</p>"
