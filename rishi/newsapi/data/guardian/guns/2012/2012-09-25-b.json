  "<p>John Terry will have enjoyed this brief respite. His had been a tumultuous few days, a period scarred by the \"heartbreak\" of taking leave of international football after nine years and 78 caps and fuelled by fury that his position had, in his opinion, been rendered \"untenable\" by the charges brought against him by the Football Association. Off the field he finds himself embroiled yet again in a fight to clear his name.</p> <p>So, as he spent an hour and a half with the majority in this arena frequently chorusing his name with typical gusto and enjoyed a stroll against fragile lower league opponents, the turmoil of his week to date could at least be forgotten. The distractions could go ignored as he heaved himself into clearances, barked instructions to those alongside and acknowledged the acclaim from the stands with applause of his own. This was only ever going to be a brief lull. Terry, after all, is due back at Wembley stadium on Wednesday morning to resume his hearing into a charge of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand. Yet a fleeting return to football amid the maelstrom must have been welcome.</p> <p>It was all the more so because it felt unexpected. The 31-year-old was always eager to feature here, and that had apparently been Roberto Di Matteo's plan all along, but he had not trained with the full first-team since last week and had spent the previous two days a frustrated figure sat in front of an FA independent regulatory commission as he confronted his charge. His attendance amounted to six hours on Monday and another five on Tuesday morning, with day two of the hearing duly extended by lengthy legal arguments. Chelsea knew he could be selected only when he slipped out and away just after 1pm and telephoned the management en route to the team hotel.</p> <p>\"We wanted him to start but we had to see how everything panned out [at the hearing],\" said the assistant first-team coach, Eddie Newton. \"We had a phone call that he was making his way back from the FA nice and early, so it wasn't last minute. We'd covered all the bases, all the scenarios, and the best one happened.\"</p> <p>The dream scenario was improved further by the team selection of the Wolves manager, Stale Solbakken, who made 10 changes from the weekend win at Peterborough and put out what was effectively a second string team that was limp in resistance. The thwack of Terry's second-minute headed clearance set a tone. The visitors were eagerly swept aside.</p> <p>Amid the merriment the captain could afford to drift into the background and relax in a bit-part role, so infrequently was he tested. If his very involvement was a show of strength, the only real surprise was that it was his central defensive partner, Gary Cahill, who clambered above Richard Stearman at the far post to thump a header from Juan Mata's free-kick through Dorus de Vries after four minutes. The opener might more normally have been scripted as Terry's. Regardless, Wolves were breached and already beaten.</p> <p>Solbakken will presumably be rebuked by the Football League under new rules aimed at preventing clubs fielding under-strength teams, though sanctions will not be imposed until next season, but he appeared sanguine. \"We had to be sensible,\" he said. \"When you see our fixtures... it was a calculated risk and I'd have done the same again, but there's no one else to blame but me. This could happen if Chelsea played well and they did.\"</p> <p>Those he had picked will have departed scorched. Ryan Bertrand, fed by Lucas Piazon's precise pull-back, added to the plunder \u2013 as did the excellent Mata \u2013 while the visitors were still groggy. There was a penalty won by Victor Moses and dispatched by Oriol Romeu, a near-post header from Torres and a first Chelsea goal for Moses nodded into a gaping net. It was a mismatch from start to finish, with the home side ruthless and the visitors prone.</p> <p>Terry's own battle will be significantly harder and it is to that reality that he returns on Wednesday. His defence counsel is expected to start delivering evidence in his favour as the hearing continues during this week. This match, by comparison, was light relief.</p>",
  "<p>An unscripted Today programme revelation about the Queen's hostility to the radical Islamic cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri forced the BBC into making an embarrassing apology to Buckingham Palace for breaching royal protocol.</p> <p>Frank Gardner, the BBC's security correspondent, prompted the early morning crisis by reporting on Radio 4's flagship news programme that the Queen had told him she was aghast that Abu Hamza, who faces imminent extradition to the US, could not be arrested during the period when he aired vehemently anti-British views as imam of Finsbury Park mosque in north London.</p> <p>With the tacit approval of director-general George Entwistle, in only his second week in the job, the BBC's director of news, Helen Boaden, swiftly authorised the release of a statement of apology that was highly critical of the journalist. Gardner \u2013 who corporation insiders said was contrite shortly after the broadcast \u2013 penned a personal apology to the palace.</p> <p>Speaking at about 8.15am, the journalist said: \"And actually I can tell you that the Queen was pretty upset ... that there was no way to arrest him [Abu Hamza]. She couldn't understand why \u2013 surely there was some law that he had broken.\"</p> <p>Naughtie, interviewing Gardner, paused and said \"that's a fascinating piece of information\". In turn, a clearly pleased Gardner said, \"yes, I thought I'd drop that in\" \u2013 and, revealing his source, he added: \"She told me.\" Concluding the exchange, Naughtie said \"that's a corker\" \u2013 and the revelation swiftly topped the programme's news bulletin.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, however, BBC executives immediately sounded the alarm, worried that Gardner had revealed the Queen's private thinking. The monarch never expresses overtly political views in public \u2013 and the convention is that whatever is said at palace receptions or other meetings remains off the record.</p> <p>Although the Queen meets the prime minister weekly where possible, and has regular contact with other ministers, leaks about her views are rare. The veil of secrecy about royal political involvement also extends to other members of the royal family. Earlier this month the government lost a battle to prevent departments having to disclose \"black spider\" memos written by the Prince of Wales to ministers and officials, although the ruling is the subject of an appeal.</p> <p>The reporter's revelation was \"wholly inappropriate,\" the BBC said. \"The conversation should have remained private and the BBC and Frank deeply regret this breach of confidence ... Frank is extremely sorry for the embarrassment caused and has apologised to the palace.\"</p> <p>Sources at the BBC said that the broadcaster had little choice but to apologise, first because Gardner had compromised a source \u2013 and second because \"that source was the head of state around which there is a convention that their private conversations are never referred to\".</p> <p>Gardner had not told anyone on the Today programme, which is edited by Ceri Thomas, that he intended to refer to the Queen on the air. Afterwards the correspondent, who uses a wheelchair after he was shot six times in Saudi Arabia by al-Qaida terrorists, tweeted: \"Thanks to all those who've posted kind messages. Not exactly the best day but I can think of worse ones I've had ...\"</p> <p>With Gardner's story already dominating its own news agenda, the BBC was forced to carry both the original report of the Queen's concern about Abu Hamza alongside its own apology. The paradox was forced on the broadcaster, because it believed that Gardner's story was accurate, but that it was in fact wrong to have reported it. One employee said: \"We are a big organisation, and we can have more than one thought at any one time.\"</p> <p>A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said she had no comment on Gardner's interview, and hinted that it was unlikely that the palace would respond any further, sparing the BBC any further embarrassment. It is understood that the Queen's remarks about Abu Hamza were made at a private dinner in 2008 at which there were several other people present.</p> <p>During the Today programme, Gardner also said the Queen had lobbied ministers about her concerns. Gardner said: \"She spoke to the home secretary at the time and said, surely this man must have broken some laws. Why is he still at large? He was conducting these radical activities and he called Britain a toilet. He was incredibly anti-British and yet he was sucking up money from this country for a long time. He was a huge embarrassment to Muslims, who condemned him.\"</p> <p>Gardner did not specify which home secretary was lobbied, although the most likely minister, David Blunkett, who held the post from 2001 to 2004 at the peak of Abu Hamza's infamy, denied it was him. Following his initial arrest in August 2004, Hamza was convicted in 2006 of 11 charges connected to soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred.</p> <p>Blunkett said: \"I can categorically state that the Queen never raised the issue of Abu Hamza with me. Not surprisingly because my views and attitude in relation to this individual were very well known.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the republican pressure group Republic said the comments, if true, showed the monarch had needlessly \"waded into the debate\".</p> <p>He said: \"It is up to parliament and the courts to deal with these complex issues, not the Queen. Monarchists argue the Queen always remains above politics. Clearly that is not the case.\"</p> <p>The government has battled for eight years to secure Abu Hamza's extradition to the US, where he is wanted in connection with alleged plans to establish a terrorist training camp in Oregon, claims he provided material support to the Taliban, and allegations that he was involved in hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998.</p> <p>Abu Hamza's fight against extradition ended on Monday when the European court of human rights rejected his appeal, as well as those of four other terrorism suspects, and agreed an earlier ruling that their human rights would not be violated by the prospect of life sentences and solitary confinement in a US prison.</p> <p>The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, is considering whether or not to sanction a private prosecution in the UK of Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan, two of the five terrorism suspects facing extradition. Ahmad has been held in detention without trial since 2004.</p> <h2>George Entwistle</h2> <p>Barely a week into the top job and the BBC's new director general, George Entwistle, faces the first big test of his leadership and judgment.</p> <p>The former Newsnight editor's first few days have been dominated by the issue of too few women on the BBC. But in the space of a few seconds' airtime on the Today programme, the agenda shifted.</p> <p>For all his experience at the BBC \u2013 he joined as a trainee in its news department nearly a quarter of a century ago \u2013 Entwistle remains an unknown quantity as a leader, as does his ability to stand up to criticism or a hostile press.</p> <p>His sternest test came during the David Kelly affair. Jeremy Paxman has recalled how his former boss was \"put through the wringer\" after Newsnight's science editor, Susan Watts, revealed to him that the weapons inspector was a source of her reports on Iraq's military capabilities.</p> <p>Paxman said the BBC \"leant on him extremely hard to discover who had said what to whom \u2026 They put him under extreme pressure, which he withstood\".</p> <p>Former Newsnight colleagues said he was \"very hard\" on the BBC during the Hutton inquiry set up following Dr Kelly's death in 2003.</p> <p>The BBC's former director of vision, 50-year-old Entwistle succeeded Mark Thompson as director general last week on an annual salary of \u00a3450,000.</p> <p>The job description for the role said Thomspon's successor must \"be able to admit quickly when in the wrong ... but stand up to huge pressure without bending when he believes that it is right to do so\".</p> <p>Addressing staff for the first time last week, Entwistle said he would be a \"stalwart defender of the BBC when press and critics turn against us unfairly\".</p> <p>The BBC has in the past been accused of taking too long to apologise \u2013 not least over the lewd Russel Brand/Jonathan Ross voicemail messages. In this instance, it appears Entwistle's mind was made up quickly.</p>",
  "<p>The land around Stable Way, west London, has proved a popular stopping place for Gypsies and Travellers for centuries. And since the 1970s, the area, encircled by three A-roads and a train track, has been the permanent home for 20 or so Irish Traveller families. Caravans are lined up on this official site in two neat parallel rows, wedged among the concrete pillars that shoulder the hulk of the elevated Westway.</p> <p>Amid the roar of the traffic, the community of Travellers has set up a fully constituted Tenants' and Residents' Association (TRA) \u2013 one of just a dozen operating across 320 council-run Gypsy and Traveller sites in England and Wales.</p> <p>Since its creation two years ago, Stable Way TRA has had remarkable success strengthening the community's relationships with the police, health services and Kensington and Chelsea council, as well as helping to improve residents' education and cutting crime.</p> <p>Police call-outs have dropped by almost half, from 80 in 2007-08 to 47 in 2011-12, and primary school attendance has reached 100%. All families are now registered with GPs and dentists. When a measles outbreak hit the wider Traveller community last year only two children were affected on Stable Way, thanks to the success of an immunisation programme arranged through the TRA.</p> <p><strong>Cuts to funding</strong></p> <p>But the TRA's pioneering work is now threatened by cuts to funding for community and voluntary sector groups and a proposed housing development adjacent to the Travellers' homes. The association's efforts to improve its residents' lives had been aided by having a constitution, which has allowed it increased access to charitable funds.</p> <p>\"Travellers don't want to be seen as if we were asking people for money,\" says TRA chair Patrick O'Donnell. \"A lot of people at first were thinking we would be seen as if we were begging until it was explained that the money is there for residents' associations to apply for.\"</p> <p>So far it has helped secure \u00a325,000 to help families hook up to the internet in a project that combines digital literacy lessons with cookery. Residents were taught how to email, search for recipes online, and take and send pictures of what they had prepared.</p> <p>A further \u00a32,400 has put young residents through driving theory tests. Phil Regan, a research and development officer for Westway Development Trust, which helped get the TRA off the ground, says: \"One of the first points of contact between the criminal justice system and young male travellers has been persistent driving without a licence. The underlying reason is about different levels of literacy, some of them not being able to read or write enough to do the theory test.\" Five out of the 12 involved have passed the test so far.</p> <p>Regular police attendance at TRA meetings has also improved relationships between police and residents. Travellers' dogs are now regularly checked and tagged, and police officers make greater efforts to act on residents' complaints. \"People sometimes throw abuse and objects like bottles down from the Westway,\" says Regan. \"At the last meeting, three officers from the transport police came along and said they really wanted to help. Now all incidents are fully recorded by the site manager and passed on to the police so they can follow them up.\"</p> <p>Stable Way is seen within the Conservative-controlled Kensington and Chelsea council as a key part of its effort to build the prime minister's \"big society\". \"We want to build a borough in which individuals can find support, purpose and solidarity from a range of voluntary bodies, be they TRAs, clubs or some other form of association,\" says a council spokesman. \"We see supporting the development of TRAs as part of that.\"</p> <p>Stable Way is also held up as an example of how to empower Gypsy and Traveller communities in new research by the <a href=\"http://tsrc.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Third Sector Research Centre (TSRC)</a>. The UK's 300,000 Gypsies and Travellers are among the most socially excluded and politically disempowered groups in British society, concludes the TSRC report, Hearing the Voice of Gypsies and Travellers. \"This lack of political power is evidenced by the small number of TRAs that exist,\" says the report. It adds that TRAs such as Stable Way can \"play an important role in improving access to services. They can represent the needs of tenants and make them aware of support and services\".</p> <p>The Irish Traveller Movement strongly supports the creation of residents' associations on Traveller sites. \"What's happening on Stable Way is very important,\" says Yvonne MacNamara, its chief executive. \"Traveller tenants' associations or residents' groups need to become legally constituted. This gives the Travellers involved a voice and more power. If a residents' group is legally constituted, then, by law, a local authority has to engage with them.\"</p> <p>But MacNamara fears Traveller TRAs will suffer from council funding cuts. \"If the TRAs and other stakeholders want something but the local authority can't afford it, then it's very unlikely to happen. That's the problem with the coalition government's big society idea, in a nutshell.\"</p> <p>Report author Andrew Ryder, who acts as an adviser to the all-party parliamentary group for Traveller law reform, wants to see the few Traveller TRA success stories replicated across the UK, but he warns this could prove to be a huge challenge. \"What is lacking is the financial support,\" he says. The big society rhetoric has not really helped those at the margins who need intensive support to get going, he explains. \"We are talking about people who have been very disempowered.\"</p> <p>Stable Way's achievements are also under threat from a regeneration scheme with a footprint of five rugby fields, which could be built on derelict land in a neighbouring borough right next to the Westway site. The plan for the sprawling former Dairy Crest site includes 11 buildings of up to 32 storeys, shops, restaurants and bars, and 1,150 homes.</p> <p>The Travellers are frustrated that such a major development could go ahead while their repeated pleas for better accommodation have been ignored. No extra provision has been made in either borough since the site was officially recognised.</p> <p>Martin Ward, a member of the TRA who has lived on Stable Way since 1972, says: \"This site is for all of west London and we have got overcrowding here. In 40 years they could have bought another site.\"</p> <p>The Travellers were sent a letter inviting them to consult about the planning proposals and they will be making their views known through the TRA, but O'Donnell believes its powers to influence decision-making are pretty slim. \"The reason we set up the residents' association was to have a bigger say in the running of the site, but the council still seems to have the final word,\" he says. \"If you look out there you can see daylight, but if they build those high rises it is going to be like we are indoors all the time.\"</p> <p>Kensington and Chelsea council says it recognises the Westway site is far from ideal, but the borough is one of the most densely developed and expensive places in the world. \"It is formidably difficult to find affordable land for any purpose,\" says a spokesman. He adds that the council has applied to the Greater London authority and the Big Lottery fund to help pay for improvements to the site, including an extra pitch to accommodate a family.</p> <p> \u2022 A photographic exhibition, The&#xa0;Westway: a&#xa0;portrait of a community by Paul Wenham-Clarke, will be shown at St&#xa0;Martin-in-the-Fields Crypt Gallery, London, from 7 January 2013</p>",
  "<p>Civil rights activists staged a protest in Houston on Tuesday, after an unarmed man in a wheelchair was shot dead by police at a care home for the mentally ill.</p> <p>Members of the National Black United Front marched in front of city hall and joined with other local pressure groups in demanding an independent investigation into the shooting.</p> <p>At around 2am on Saturday, police were called to the Healing Hands Assisted Home Care house, about a mile south-east of downtown Houston, after a resident became agitated because he was refused cigarettes and soda.</p> <p>According to a police statement, Brian Claunch grew violent and threatened to kill two patrolmen and others in the home. He \"waved a shiny object in his hand in their direction\" and attempted to stab one of the officers, at which point the other officer, Matthew Marin, shot Claunch. The shiny object proved to be a ballpoint pen.</p> <p>Claunch was reportedly killed by a single shot to the head. The 45-year-old was a schizophrenic who had lost most of his right leg and his entire right arm when he was hit by a train, the Houston Chronicle reported. He had a criminal record, including drug convictions.</p> <p>Marin, who became an officer in 2007, also killed a suspect when on duty in 2009, when he fired on a man who had stabbed his neighbor to death and who refused to drop the knife.</p> <p>Shootings by police appear to be on the rise in the US's fourth-largest city. <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Fatal-shooting-of-double-amputee-sparks-call-for-3888173.php\">The Houston Chronicle reported that in the first seven months of this year, the city's police had been involved in 14 shooting incidents, killing seven people</a> \u2013 almost double the number of shootings compared with the same period last year. Twenty-one people were shot in the whole of 2011, nine fatally.</p> <p>The Greater Houston Coalition for Justice had previously called for the US Attorney General to investigate alleged civil-rights violations by Houston police. After the latest incident, it will ask for an acceleration of the request.</p> <p>\"This occurs quite often,\" Johnny Mata, a member of the Coalition, told the Guardian. \"This is an horrendous death that could have been handled differently.\" </p> <p>Mata also pointed to the case of Rufino Lara, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who was shot dead by a police officer who stated that Lara ignored repeated orders to stop and show his hands. The officer said she had believed that Lara may have had a weapon, since he turned to face her with one of his hands tucked under his shirt. A search showed that there was a beer can in his waistband and two witnesses claim that he had his hands against a wall both before and as he turned.</p> <p>Amin Alehashem, staff attorney at the Houston office of the Texas Civil Rights Project, told the Guardian that Claunch's death was \"absolutely disturbing. A lot of people are very upset.\" He described the killing as \"particularly egregious\", given the circumstances, and \"in cold blood. I don't understand why the officer didn't shoot a Taser or something else.\"</p> <p>Alehashem said that in the wider context Claunch's death was indicative of a \"systemic failure\" that puts officers in situations they are ill-equipped to handle. </p> <p>\"With all the budget cuts in social services you're seeing police being put in the role of social worker and it's not a role they're really trained to play,\" he said.</p> <p>Charles McClelland, the Houston chief of police, said he had asked the local FBI office to investigate the incident. </p> <p>\"The Houston Police Department places the highest value on human life and events like these are tragic and unfortunate for everyone involved,\" he said in a statement. \"All Houston Police Officers receive mandatory crisis intervention training specifically dealing with persons experiencing mental crisis. </p> <p>\"As we do in all instances of this nature, the Houston Police Department's Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions, and the Harris County District Attorneys Office, Civil Rights Division, are investigating this incident.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Don't run away with the idea that it is open season on Andrew Mitchell. It isn't. We just think he's an interesting guy and we want to know more about him. Yesterday we learned how Mitchell leaned on another Conservative called Andrew Mitchell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/24/hugh-muir-diary-andrew-mitchell\" title=\"\">to change his name to avoid confusion</a>. This elicited little surprise at his former workplace, the Department for International Development, where the entrance lobby features an impressive photo-gallery of past ministers. By tradition, ministerial photos are only added to this display after they have departed, but Mitchell wasn't having any of that. He demanded that his picture be added to the wall of fame shortly after his arrival. Officials complied. What else could they do?</p> <p>\u2022 And what can we say about his life? Well, we know the boy done good. The son of a former Tory MP, he lived in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9563268/Andrew-Mitchells-life-of-deprivation-in-Sloane-Square.html\" title=\"\">Sloane Square, it is true, but the family was prudent</a>, perhaps to excess. Thus, says the Telegraph, he became accustomed to eating time-worn peas, leftover mousse and toast from the previous day. Fast forward, and we learn from the Sun that on the day of Gate-gate, Mitchell lunched at the <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4555370/pleb-row-minister-Andrew-Mitchells-lunchtime-session-at-posh-curry-house.html\" title=\"\">Cinnamon Club in Westminster</a>, perhaps the poshest Indian restaurant in Britain. And the Times informs us that when the police officers triggered his rage, he was en route to a bash at the Carlton Club, the elite Conservative joint in Mayfair. This is progress indeed, for neither establishment serves day-old peas or mousse passed down through generations. The ambitious man moves on. Mitchell is certainly ambitious.</p> <p>\u2022 Should he have been arrested? Certainly under the doctrine expressed by Boris Johnson, mayor of London, not so long ago. \"If people swear at the police, then they must expect to be arrested,\" the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/tory-chief-whip-andrew-mitchell-police\" title=\"\">mayor told Tory conference</a> last year. So Mitchell has been lucky \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/25/boris-johnson-police-andrew-mitchell\" title=\"\">Johnson himself acknowledged yesterday</a>. By contrast, Brian Coleman, former chair of the London Assembly, former chair of the mayor's fire authority in London, and until recently one of the highest remunerated councillors in the country, has been less fortunate. A contretemps last week with a long-time rival in Barnet, his north London fiefdom, saw Cllr Coleman <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19668693\" title=\"\">arrested on suspicion of common assault</a>. She had accused the man who led the parking restriction regime in the borough of himself parking illegally. Things got out of hand. There was a tussle for her cameraphone, it was said, and his car apparently hit a truck. His version may conflict.

Between 2007 and 2009 he was consulted on bills relating to coroners, energy, planning, economic development and construction, marine and coastal access, and housing and regeneration.</p> <p>In Charles's case, the little known power stems from his role as head of the \u00a3700m Duchy of Cornwall estate, which provides his \u00a318m-a-year private income.</p> <p>Kirkhope called the Cabinet Office's appeal outrageous. \"All I have asked to see is a copy of the rules by which it is determined laws are made in this country. Why do parliamentarians tolerate a situation in which they introduce a bill in parliament and someone may come up to them and say you need the consent of the Duke of Cornwall? If they ask why, they'll be told the Cabinet Office guidance is secret and they are not allowed to see it.\"</p>",
  "<p>The question that hangs over the conference season as a whole is the purpose of these shrivelling, staged-managed affairs. The particular question over proceedings in Brighton this week is the purpose of a Liberal Democrat party that is ground down by compromise in a coalition that is drifting to the right.</p> <p>Tuesday night's debate on the justice and security bill provided a heartening response to both of these rude inquiries. It was not a minister nor an ambitious parliamentarian adopting the \"line to take\" who set the tone, but the activist Jo Shaw. From Hillsborough to rendition to friendly fire, she explained, if we've learned anything, we have learned the dangers of shrouding state power in secrecy. And yet here was a bill \u2013 being tabled while avowed liberals sit in high office \u2013 which would shut off the lights in public courtrooms.</p> <p>It is a credit to the party that even those <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-lib-dem-conference\" title=\"\">speakers</a> who did the leadership's bidding by pleading for compromise felt the need to pitch&#xa0;their case in the language of civil liberties. Reasonably enough, they picked holes in the existing system of public interest immunity certificates, under which judges protect security by wielding the black marker pen. They pointed to the incremental advances&#xa0;made since the security state's audacious opening bid in the<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19716941\" title=\"\"> green paper</a> \u2013 the retreat from the plan for blackout blinds in inquests, for example. In the end, however, the case for the defence was blown away by force of argument.</p> <p>The government protests that secret courts \u2013 more properly, \"closed material proceedings\" \u2013 are all about enabling the courts to take heed of evidence that they are currently forced to ignore. But this would be secret evidence seen by one side but not the other, and thus would unbalance the scales of justice. The problem of principle was expressed by Lord Kerr in the supreme court last year: \"the right to be informed of the case made against you is not merely a feature of the adversarial system of trial, it is an elementary and essential prerequisite of justice\". The problem of practice, which was put by delegate after delegate yesterday, was the sort of thing that would get covered up. The impetus for the scheme was not some abstract concern to bring more evidence to court, still less any deficiency with public protection immunities. Rather, it was the embarrassment brought on the state in cases such as Binyam Mohamed, which exposed the UK's knowledge of US torture. Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/24/government-secret-courts-bad-publicity\" title=\"\">Whitehall's own \"impact analysis\"</a> of its plans does not focus narrowly on national security, but also on containing \"political cost\" \u2013 or, in other words, political blushes.</p> <p>The deficiencies of the plan are severe, numerous and sufficient reason to celebrate its defeat. Beyond them, however, lies a wider fear \u2013 of the creeping return of the casual contempt for liberty which was associated with the later Blair years. The day before the debate, Strasbourg had licensed the extradition of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/24/abu-hamza-extradition-us\" title=\"\">Abu Hamza</a>, and thereby dealt a blow to the lazy line \u2013 half-reflected in the Queen's reported <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19716941\" title=\"\">intervention</a> \u2013 that due process and human rights are somehow incompatible with proper security and transatlantic relations. The Lib Dems have now voted to reaffirm hard-won liberties which have survived far graver threats than today. And they have voted, too, against any dissent over the \"trust us\" approach to governance which produced the Iraq dossier a decade ago.</p> <p>This is a party of temperamental compromise, as has been on show all this week. In power it has sometimes compromised too far, particularly on macroeconomics. But last night it reminded us that it does not regard liberty as something to be traded away, like some detail in the spending round. By calling for the entire second section of this injurious bill to be dumped, it has drawn a line incomparably sharper than the fuzzier complaints that translated into muddy compromises in the case of the health service reforms. The party has spoken, and the leadership will not deserve the liberal label if it fails to listen.</p>",
  "<p>So, iPhone users, how do you like being collateral damage?</p> <p>If you \"upgrade\" to iOS6, Apple's latest mobile operating system, you are going to lose an essential app that was native and bundled in previous systems. What you'll get instead is, by all accounts, inferior to what's gone missing. I refer, of course, to the mapping software that Apple has cobbled together from several small-company buyouts and its own considerable, if inadequate to date, efforts to create a serious rival to the banished Google Maps.</p> <p>If you are an iPhone user, you're suffering \u2013 I use that term almost in jest, as this is a classic #FirstWorldProblem, in Twitter hashtag lingo \u2013 as a consequence of a war between two corporate giants. In this particular case, your situation stems from: Apple's desire to dominate tomorrow's computing; its absolute loathing of Google; and its willingness to treat customers badly, at least in the short term, in order to achieve corporate goals.</p> <p>This is nothing new in the technology world. In its heyday, Microsoft made all kinds of unilateral decisions to thwart competition, caring not in the slightest \u2013 monopolists don't have to care \u2013 that it was giving its own customers fewer and, in some cases, inferior choices. Apple has entwined its mobile customers so completely at this point that they'll tend to accept any and all abuses of this kind. Just try to read an Amazon Kindle book, which currently dominates the ebook market, on another platform. The list goes on and on and on.</p> <p>It should not be surprising that Apple's mapping solution is nowhere near as good as Google's at this stage of its development. But there's reason to believe it may never be. As the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/\">Atlantic magazine's Alexis Madrigal pointed out</a> in a deep look at the systems and people behind the Google product, this team has been doing things with enormous care and precision for many years now, and shows no sign of slowing down.</p> <p>Apple has the deepest pockets in the corporate world, however, with more than $100bn in cash and a sales machine that mints billions more each month. It's spending some of that to make a competitive mapping product. Already, the production values of its app \u2013 the way it looks and feels \u2013 are better than Google's in some ways, though the details of streets and places lag far behind, <a href=\"http://www.spydergrrl.com/2012/09/apple-maps-epic-fail-or-stunning.html\">with Escher-like results</a> brightening the day of countless internet wags.</p> <p>Apple is also spending some of its cash on lawyers, battalions of them around the world, suing companies that have the temerity to make Android-powered hardware. Samsung is the primary target so far. This \"lawfare\" is related to the map battle, because the larger strategic goal for Apple is all about controlling mobile computing and everything that relates to it. At this point, Google and its Android allies are the most serious impediment.</p> <p>Maps are dashboards to incredibly valuable information and services. When Apple sends its users to Google Maps, as it did in the past, it was sending them into the Google ecosystem, where the search giant can leverage its own area of dominance: online advertising. In coming years, as we do more and more with our mobile devices, whichever company can get us to use <em>its</em> dashboard will have a big advantage in other areas of mobile activity, especially commerce.</p> <p>I'm not fond of Apple, as I've noted here, because of its incessant, and increasing, control-freakery towards suppliers, software developers and customers. But I'd rather see it compete with its own maps than let Google utterly own the field.</p> <p>Google and Apple aren't the only alternatives in the mapping universe. <a href=\"http://maps.nokia.com/?lang=en-US\">Nokia is among</a> a number of companies investing in the field. I'm not fond of the notion, however, that giant corporations should control mapping in any event. So I'd like to see the great <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\">Open Street Maps project</a> get even more traction. Its goal is to create a global, user-generated and open map database that anyone can use. If more people would take the time to add their knowledge of their local areas, it would get even better.</p> <p>Meanwhile, users of Apple's mobile devices have to choose between getting the latest operating system tweaks and a native mapping app that gives reliable results. My suggestion: if you feel compelled to use iOS6, use Google or Nokia maps from the browser, realizing that you won't get the coolest features. Or stick with iOS5. Or, if you can't imagine life without doing what Apple tells you to do in every respect, be prepared to not find what you're looking for, or end up somewhere you didn't expect.</p> <p>That's how life goes when one company launches its weapons at another, and you're in the line of fire.</p>",
  "<p>The House of Commons is not representative of the electorate. The House of Commons has 650 MPs. Of these 650, there are 504 male MPs, so women are seriously underrepresented.

  "<p>It is difficult to gauge how prevalent inappropriate pupil-teacher relationships in schools are as statistics are difficult to obtain and anecdotal evidence can be misleading.</p> <p>A 2007 YouGov survey of 2,200 adults said one in six knew of someone who had had an \"intimate relationship\" with a teacher while at school. Between 1991 and 2008 a total of 129 teachers were prosecuted for relationships with pupils, according to reports.</p> <p>Teaching unions report that incidents are actually \"very rare\". Yet this is not the first questionable relationship to emerge at Bishop Bell school. One school has dealt with no fewer than five incidents. When, in 2009, Christopher Reen, 31, a classroom supervisor at Headlands school in Bridlington, was jailed for three years and four months after admitting six counts of sexual activity with a 15-year-old female pupil, it emerged four ex-staff at the same school had faced the courts in recent years over inappropriate sexual conduct.</p> <p>Incidents are not confined to older male teachers with younger female pupils. Helen Goddard, a 26-year-old private school music teacher, was jailed for 15 months in 2009 over a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl. Madeleine Martin, 39, a religious education teacher, was jailed for 32 months after a brief relationship with a 15-year-old at the Manchester boys school where she worked.</p> <p>It is an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 for a person over 18 to have a sexual relationship with a child under 18 where that person is in a position of trust in respect of that child, even if the relationship is consensual. That applies where the child is in full-time education and the person works in the same place as the child, even if the person does not teach the child.</p> <p>Alan McLean, a chartered educational psychologist, said that although they are above the age of consent 16 to 18-year-olds are still deemed vulnerable in law. \"It's an asymmetrical power relationship. That's at the heart of this, and there is obviously a huge taboo and fear of children being exploited in relationships. They are vulnerable in that power relationship, and that is why there is such a strong reaction,\" he said. \"It's not just teachers. It can be youth leaders, sports coaches \u2026 the child is open to be manipulated, just in terms of feeling beholden to the adult.\"</p> <p>Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT union, said such cases represented a very tiny percentage of allegations made against teachers. \"It is not something that is common across the profession. When it does happen then, obviously, it is dealt with very severely. I've never known a case where a member has got to court that there either hasn't been some sanction against them at court, or dismissal for gross misconduct at school level.\"</p> <p>The union has expressed concerns over whether teachers who have had relationships with pupils aged over 16 should be placed on the sex offenders register.</p> <p>\"What we were questioning was if that same teacher had a relationship with a sixth former down the road, that wouldn't be seen as something to put them on the sex offenders register,\" she said. \"And clearly there was an anomaly in the law. Which is not to say we condone such relationships. At any level and any age, within the school it is clearly a breach of trust and is unacceptable.\"</p>",
  "<p>Nat Rothschild's disastrous acquisition of a stake in the Indonesian mining firm PT Bumi Resources was prompted by an introduction to the company arranged by a controversial JP Morgan banker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/03/jp-morgan-ian-hannam-resigns?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">currently fighting market abuse charges</a>.</p> <p>The scion of the world's most famous financial dynasty also hired Ian Hannam's bank to advise him on completing the deal, with JP Morgan overseeing the due diligence conducted on the transaction.</p> <p>On Monday, shares in Rothschild's investment vehicle, London-listed Bumi plc, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/24/rothschild-mining-bumi-investigation-indonesia?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">crashed for the second day running after the company admitted it had launched an investigation into allegations of financial dishonesty</a> at PT Bumi Resources, its main investment and one of Indonesia's largest coal producers.</p> <p>The shares collapse followed a Jakarta-based whistleblower sending Bumi plc directors documents relating to investments of $800m (\u00a3490m) made by PT Bumi Resources, the miner in which Bumi has a 29% stake. That investment is now judged to be almost worthless.</p> <p>Bumi plc added it \"intends to contact relevant authorities in the UK and Indonesia, as appropriate, in respect of some of the allegations\", with the Financial Services Authority and Serious Fraud Office understood to have been informed on Friday. An investigation by the FSA is likely to focus on heavy trading on Friday, which sent the shares down over 20%, even though the allegations were only made public on Monday.</p> <p>On Tuesday Bumi defended its investment in the Indonesian mining assets. \"The bottom line is that we have high quality, valuable Indonesian coal assets and we have been clear about delivering on high standards of corporate governance,\" said Nick von Schirnding, head of corporate affairs at Bumi plc. \"We have clearly had our challenges and structure remains one of the key issues we are looking at \u2013 something we need to resolve over the next few months.\"</p> <p>The saga has fascinated the City, particularly as Rothschild had worked furiously to become known as a serious financier and shed the playboy image of his university days, when he was famously a member of Oxford University's Bullingdon Club at the same time as the chancellor, George Osborne.</p> <p>A string of deals including creation of investment vehicles focusing on natural resources, plus winnings from running the hedge fund Atticus, meant the Sunday Times Rich List put his worth at \u00a31bn.</p> <p>However, shares in Bumi plc have lost 41% since Friday and 85% since floating last year, a huge blow to Rothschild's reputation and his fortune: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/sep/24/bumi-shares-slump-small-investors?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">investors have begun to question</a> whether the financier and his non-executives have failed on promises to bring western-style corporate governance to emerging market companies.</p> <p>Bumi, JP Morgan and Hannam declined to comment on the background to the transaction, although it is understood that at the time of the introduction the Bakrie family that controlled PT Bumi Resources was a client of the investment bank in Asia, which had helped in the raising of a high-yield bond.</p> <p>Hannam, a former member of the territorial SAS and one of the City's most senior bankers, quit his job at JP Morgan in April after being fined \u00a3450,000 by the FSA for market abuse. He is appealing against the fine. The regulator levied it after Hannam sent an email saying Heritage Oil, a JP Morgan client, had struck oil and another discussing a potential offer for the company. However, it added that Hannam's \"honesty and integrity is not in question\".</p> <p>The banker is appealing against the punishment on the grounds that it was not insider information, and was disclosed as part of his job. He said in a statement that he had resigned because, \"appealing the case while still at the firm would be an unfair distraction to my clients and colleagues\". A hearing is expected next spring.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that Hannam behaved improperly during the Bumi transaction.</p>",

  "<p>The jailing of hundreds of army officers accused of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19670530\" title=\"\">plotting a coup against the government of prime minister Tayyip Erdogan</a> marks a low-point for Turkey's military, which for decades exercised shadowy control over the country with scant regard for democratic values. But the outcome of the so-called Sledgehammer (Balyoz) case highlights a new worry: that Erdogan, in power since 2002 and with his eye on a revamped, executive presidency, is becoming just as authoritarian and over-bearing as the generals once were.</p> <p>It is possible to view the Sledgehammer trial, and two similar plot investigations (known as Ergenekon and KCK) also involving hundreds of suspects, as an overdue, even praiseworthy attempt to clean house. Turkey endured three outright military coups between 1960 and 1980, and a moderate Islamist government, a forerunner to the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), was forced from office in 1997. Tensions between the AKP and the military, proud guardians of Kemal Atat\u00fcrk's secularist legacy, were at times acute. It is not difficult to imagine the generals wanted rid of Erdogan.</p> <p>While expressing concern at the verdicts, <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/completely-off-the-rails-with-the-balyoz-case-.aspx?pageID=449&amp;nID=30881&amp;NewsCatID=405\" title=\"\">H\u00fcrriyet commentator Mehmet Ali Birand</a> said he was pleased that \"the process of relieving our country from its historical 'military tutelage' has begun\". He went on: \"We lived under this tutelage for years... It took a huge toll on this country. Democracy was killed, freedom restricted, political life ruined and the Kurdish issue escalated ... Even if there was no concrete coup preparation in the Balyoz case, I'm sure there was the idea in many minds that if necessary a coup could be staged.\"</p> <p>Sledgehammer may be viewed, alternatively, in a different light entirely \u2013 as a scandalously unjust proceeding akin to the notorious show trials mounted in the Soviet Union and its eastern European satellites during the cold war. \"This case has little to do with justice or advancing Turkish democracy and everything to do with settling old scores,\" <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/neither-justice-nor-democracy-has-been-served.aspx?pageID=449&amp;nID=30882&amp;NewsCatID=416\" title=\"\">wrote columnist Semih Idiz</a>. \"It will be Turkey that loses out in the end because this case has merely contributed to deepening the divisions in society and adding to the polarisation between Kemalists and Islamists.\u2026 It has also damaged confidence among Turks in their legal system, even though this confidence was never very high to begin with.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the Sledgehammer saga is best understood as neither a triumph for justice nor a democratic disgrace, but an intrinsically political proceeding. In this sense, it is a natural by-product of Erdogan's forceful and sometimes painful attempt to turn Turkey into a modern nation state while fully recognising its religious identity. Turkey's economy has expanded prodigiously in recent years while its regional standing has greatly improved, albeit unevenly, in terms of the Middle East and Europe. At the same time, Erdogan has relaxed religious curbs, for example allowing women more freedom to wear a headscarf, and has attempted (so far without success) to answer the perennial Kurdish question.</p> <p>These upheavals have come at a high cost in terms of internal divisions and recriminations. The justice system is but one casualty. There are many others. It seems no coincidence that many of the soldiers, politicians, Kurdish activists, lawyers, academics and journalists caught up in the Sledgehammer and other mass investigations are also Erdogan's opponents and critics. Their silencing, justified or not, will undoubtedly help him maintain his grip on power, and could yet ease his way into a powerful executive presidency via a rewritten constitution.</p> <p>\"Turkey's courts have been working overtime to throw government opponents of all political stripes behind bars,\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/turkeys-miscarriage-of-justice/2012/09/21/e2125276-033d-11e2-8102-ebee9c66e190_story.html\" title=\"\">said Dani Rodrik</a>, a Harvard professor who is a son-in-law of one of Sledgehammer's most prominent defendants, General Cetin Dogan. Rodrik said key evidence in the Sledgehammer case was forged and all the trials reeked of political interference. \"In separate cases, thousands of Kurdish politicians and activists are on trial \u2013 nearly 1,000 among them detained \u2013 for alleged links with terrorist activities. Turkey holds more journalists in jail than China and Iran combined ... I hope that the world will more closely focus on the gross miscarriage of justice taking place in Turkey. While Turkey touts itself as a leader of democratic freedoms in the Middle East, its actions in this and similar cases indicate otherwise.\"</p> <p>Erdogan has grown increasingly confident, some say arrogant, during his decade in power, and there is much speculation as to what will come next. Under a new law passed by the AKP, Turks will choose their first directly elected president in 2014. The current president, Abdullah Gul, is a long-time Erdogan associate who owes his post to the prime minister. Under the 2012 law, Gul is specifically barred from standing again, while the prime minister can stand without first resigning. Many Turks suspect that, Putin-style, Erdogan will simply swap jobs. In an interview published last week, he clearly indicated his willingness to stand. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/lally-weymouth-interviews-turkish-prime-minister-recep-tayyip-erdogan/2012/09/20/a837da66-01c7-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_story.html\" title=\"\">The people, he said, only had to ask</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Mohamed Nasheed rightly claims that \"the Maldives stand on a knife edge\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/maldives-our-democracy-suffocated-help\" title=\"\">A footnote in our history, 19 September</a>). But it is him, not the current unity government, who threatens the future of the island's \"hard-won liberal democracy\". I should know: I served as a special adviser under both him and President Mohammed Waheed, and have witnessed at first hand Nasheed's efforts to topple the government by direct action.</p> <p>Nasheed is popular with the international media, has been a vocal champion of the climate change cause and has friends in high places, notably in the Conservative party. He is extremely close to the foreign secretary William Hague, and just before his fall from grace, David Cameron reportedly described him as his \"new best friend\". Nasheed has often stated that he was&#xa0;tortured and illegally imprisoned under the former President Gayoom. Yet&#xa0;when in power he behaved in exactly the same way when he illegally arrested the chief judge after he passed a ruling he did not like.</p> <p>In his article Nasheed repeats the claim that he was forced from office by a coup, and that a bunch of extremists \"orchestrated February's overthrow of the Maldives' first democratically elected government\". Unfortunately the facts do not bear out this assertion. An <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=commonwealth%20commission%20of%20national%20inquiry&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coni.org.mv%2Fconi%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2FC0NI-Report.pdf&amp;ei=8LZhUN3NB4mW0QWV84H4Aw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGeY87e6cvRHAopSy3n7D1uoQdQA&amp;sig2=o3fwB56BkxUS_w8IxuF95Q\" title=\"\">exhaustive report by the Commonwealth last month</a> found there was no coup, and that in fact Nasheed resigned voluntarily. The inquiry took six months to compile and interviewed nearly 300 witnesses who gave more than 200 hours of statements.</p> <p>Nasheed's accusation of a coup was&#xa0;reported around the world, but when the evidence didn't stack up, large sections of the media chose to ignore an inconvenient truth. Crucially, at the time the report was published, its conclusions were also accepted by&#xa0;Nasheed.</p> <p>In a recent speech to the Royal Commonwealth Society he claims that there was a \"cover-up\". If so, the cover-up includes a professor of constitutional law from Canada, a senior judge with 25 years of experience from New Zealand, and a retired supreme court judge from Singapore, all of whom were on the inquiry panel.</p> <p>When it comes to hyperbole, Nasheed is in a league of his own. A large pinch of salt is need when considering his article's claim that \"Numerous members of parliament from my party, the Maldives Democratic party, have been taken before pliant judges and stripped of their seats\", or previous claims that he was \"forced to resign at gunpoint\".</p> <p>The facts are that on 7 February 2012, confronted with serious unrest over his illegal arrest of the chief judge, Nasheed resigned on his own volition and then, belatedly realising what he had done, tried to claim it was a coup in order to court international sympathy and media coverage. This leaves a lot of unanswered questions about his judgment as a person, suitability as candidate, and credibility as a politician.</p> <p>Nasheed states that he doesn't want&#xa0;the Maldives to \"once again become a police state, and our cherished democracy relegated to a footnote in the history books \u2013 a one-off&#xa0;experiment&#xa0;that failed\". I agree, and&#xa0;would ask him now to work with the unity government to bring peace back to the streets, so that next year we&#xa0;can have free and fair&#xa0;elections.<em> </em></p>",

But in this devastating expose, the serious academic Dinesh D'Souza, president of the world-renowned <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King%27s_College_%28New_York%29\">Well-Respected College For Serious Academics</a>, reveals the truth: behind Obama's facade \u2013 unknown to his closest aides, his wife and children, or even to Obama himself \u2013 the president is angry, burning with a boiling anti-colonialist desire to subjugate America. Based on hundreds of hours of extensive daydreaming, FURY leaves the reader in no doubt that President Obama, who as you may know is black, is also very, very angry \u2013 as a direct result of his furious rage.</p> <p><strong>I KNOW YOU ARE, BUT WHAT AM I? by Jonah Goldberg</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396680593\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348599058643/goldberg.jpg\" alt=\"Jonah Goldberg\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In this pathbreaking work of scholarship \u2013 a tour-de-force in the style of his bestseller <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0385511841\">Liberal Fascism</a> \u2013 National Review writer Goldberg turns conventional wisdom on its head.

Actually, he's <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/slates_10th_anniversary/2006/06/whats_wrong_with_slate_4.html\">vociferously opposed to contrarianism</a>. True to the spirit of Goldberg's worldview, the spine of this book is to the right of the pages, rather than to the left, the words can only be read if reflected in a mirror and the best way to enjoy it is not to buy it.</p> <p><strong>PUNK'D!!!

As if to prove his point, the book became a New York Times No 1 bestseller, but only for several weeks \u2013 and although Goldberg was interviewed in many news outlets, not one liberal publication dedicated an entire issue to his work.

  "<p>Negotiating Aleppo\u2019s checkpoints is not an easy task. As the frontlines shift, rebels and government soldiers come to resemble each other: they dress the same, are equally menacing, and put fear in your heart. One afternoon, as the fighting in Salah al-Din subsided, I stood with a group of rebels manning one of these roadblocks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/syria-civil-war-five-years-guardian-reporting\">Syria's civil war: five years of Guardian reporting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>State TV channels had declared Salah al-Din \u201cfree from terrorist elements\u201d, and a few civilians had taken the opportunity of the lull in fighting to try to find loved ones or visit their apartments. The rebels checked ID cards and pulled some people for questioning, but mostly tried to dissuade people from driving into the middle of a war zone.</p> <p>A young, pink-faced man dressed in a clean, short-sleeved white shirt and black trousers arrived at the checkpoint. He was brought to Captain Abu Mohamed by a fighter who said he thought two of the man\u2019s cousins were working for the regime.</p> <p>The captain questioned the pink-faced man politely, until it became apparent that he had mistaken Abu Mohamed and his men, who were all dressed in military fatigues, for regular soldiers.</p> <p>The captain played along, asking if there were members of the Free Army in the area the man was crossing into.</p> <p>\u201cThere are, sir,\u201d said the young man. \u201cIf you have enough men I can lead you to them. I know their places I can assure you.\u201d</p> <p>Abu Mohamed called one of the rebels over and told him they had found a proud citizen who could help them. This man was also dressed in military uniform, but he had a thick beard and his jacket was adorned with FSA insignia.</p> <p>The boy flinched. \u201cAre you rebels, sir?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, but we dress like them to infiltrate them,\u201d said the rebel.</p> <p>\u201cSir, I want to join you and help you fight them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat. We will take your name and give you two weeks\u2019 training and can make you a lieutenant.\u201d</p> <p>The other rebel started filming the young man with his phone, pretending he was doing it for the pro-regime TV channel. Like a schoolboy standing in front of the teacher, the young man started parroting regime rhetoric: \u201cThe terrorist elements are in the school right now. They number 56. Only 11 of them Syrians, sir, these terrorist elements are committing terrorist activities that are terrifying the innocent citizens. They entered my house took our TV set and tried to rape my mother they go around stealing houses and raping young boys and girls.\u201d</p> <p>The joke ended when the rebel with the phone landed a huge slap on the man\u2019s neck. The boy froze as the extent of the trouble he was in dawned on him. More rebels gathered. The boy tried to change his story and then changed it back again, knowing he was in the middle of something bad.</p> <p>Captain Abu Mohamed intervened. He led the young man onto a nearby bus and asked one of the fighters to guard him. But a crowd of rebels had gathered around the bus and another slap landed on his face. He was clearly shocked, confused and didn\u2019t know who had captured him. He fluctuated between denouncing the army and the FSA.</p> <p>Four men led him out of the bus, Abu Mohamed shouting at them not to hit him. The men took him into an office they had been using as sleeping quarters and for the first time a look of horror covered the young man\u2019s face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee3df596309f974af4e77d8a1206f7e79903f0e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee3df596309f974af4e77d8a1206f7e79903f0e3/0_0_5212_3125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man sits on a bus having been detained by rebels in Aleppo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man sits on a bus having been detained at a checkpoint in Aleppo by Free Syrian Army rebels on suspicion of belonging to the Assad regime\u2019s security forces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then four of the rebels took him into a smaller room and closed the door. The men grew disturbingly calm.</p> <p>First they made their suspect kneel. \u201cSir, sir, I made a mistake,\u201d the young man pleaded. \u201cPlease sir.\u201d His voice was quivering.</p> <p>The rebels went silently to work. They didn\u2019t speak, but each seemed to know exactly what to do. They made the suspect lie on his stomach as one fighter put his foot on his spine and pulled his arms back until he screamed.</p> <p>Two more knelt by his feet, pushing his lower legs between a kalashnikov and its sling and twisting the gun until it was tight around his calves. A fourth rebel pinned the young man\u2019s shoulder to the ground with his foot, placing the tip of a bayonet on the nape of man\u2019s neck.</p> <p>A fifth man tore through the contents of a cabinet until he found a power cable. He sat twisting it and wrapping it in tape until it resembled a nightstick. A sixth young rebel sat with a pen and paper to take notes.</p> <p>\u201cSir, sir, it\u2019s a mistake! I thought you were soldiers!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell us who are the shabiha [government militia] that you know,\u201d asked the man with the bayonet.</p> <p>\u201cSir, I don\u2019t know. I am a normal citizen!\u201d His voice was high-pitched and filled with terror.</p> <p>The man standing on his spine pulled back the young man\u2019s arms while the men at his feet twisted the gun\u2019s strap tighter. He screamed.</p> <p>\u201cI will talk,\u201d he said, gasping for air. \u201cI will talk.\u201d</p> <p>He gave the rebels several names, which the man with the paper wrote down. They asked for more. He gave more.</p> <p>\u201cYou are lying now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir, I am not.\u201d</p> <p>The interrogator\u2019s every question was accompanied by the man\u2019s arms pulled to the back, a tightening of the rifle sling and more pressure on the bayonet.</p> <p>Then the two men lifted his feet and the man with the power cable swung it high and landed it perfectly on the man\u2019s fat, bare feet. The screams became more like squeals now. The sweat was pouring from the torturers faces as they bent to their task.</p> <p>\u201cThis is so you can remember!\u201d shouted the man with the cable.</p> <p>\u201cStop! I will give all the names you want!\u201d</p> <p>When the young man who was writing lifted his head and said he was repeating the same names, the man who was pulling his arms jumped up and landed on the young man\u2019s kidneys. He began to weep so they started another round of beating.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell us what we want?\u201d</p> <p>But there was nothing he could have said that would have stopped the men.</p> <p>When the young man\u2019s ordeal ended for the day, the sun was setting. Abu Mohamed said he was sure the kid was mad.</p> <p>Three days later, I met one of the men who had been torturing the young man. He had a sorry look on his face.</p> <p>\u201cAll the names he gave us were fake. Those people don\u2019t exist. Now the Islamists have taken him. They are interrogating him and they are not letting anyone else see him.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Names have been changed to protect the identity of those involved</p>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama today sought to reset US relations with the Arab world in the wake of anti-American riots triggered by an amateur video insulting the prophet Mohamed, that led to the death of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens.</p> <p>Obama used his speech to the UN general assembly, expected to be his last major foreign policy address before the November elections, to pay a personal tribute to Stevens, highlighting the murdered diplomat's passion for Arab culture and support for democracy, and present it a model for American-Arab relations.</p> <p>The president also restated the US position on the Iran nuclear programme: that there was still time for diplomacy, but not \"unlimited time\". He also called for the emergence of a new, democratic and inclusive government in Syria, but offered no new ideas about how the international community should help attain that goal, or how the deadlock in the UN security council over Syria might be broken.</p> <p>In a landmark speech in Cairo three years ago, Obama promised a \"new beginning\" in the relationship between his country and the Islamic world, but that relationship is now at its lowest point since the start of the Arab spring as a result of a YouTube video clip made by an Egyptian American insulting the prophet Mohamed.</p> <p>The crude 14-minute clip went viral over the summer, triggering furious anti-American demonstrations across the Middle East and the wider Islamic world.</p> <p>Obama balanced condemnation of the \"crude and disgusting\" video, with a denunciation of the violence that it sparked and a demand for the new Arab governments to do more to defend American diplomats.</p> <p>\"I have made it clear that the US government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity,\" Obama said. \" It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well. We are home to Muslims who worship across our country.\"</p> <p>Obama rejected calls from Arab and other Islamic leaders for the YouTube video to be somehow banned, pointed to US constitutional protections of free speech and the technical impossibility of controlling such broadcasts.</p> <p>\"[I]n 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete. The question, then, is how we respond. And on this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies mindless violence,\" he said. He also criticised double standards in the protection of religion in the Middle East.</p> <p>\"The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. Yet to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the Holocaust is denied,\" the president said.</p> <p>He also made clear his dissatisfaction with the reaction of some Arab governments to the wave of anti-American riots. US officials have singled out the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, in this regard.</p> <p>\"If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an embassy; or to put out statements of regret, and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of this crisis,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama expressed gratitude to the government and people of Libya, after pro-American protesters seized control of the bases of the extremist militias implicated in the attacks on the US consulate in Benghazi, but he made it clear Washington did not believe all the perpetrators had been caught, and left open the option of taking direct action.</p> <p>\"The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan government and the Libyan people. And there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice,\" the president said.</p> <p>Earlier, the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon issued an unusually stern denouncement of security council inaction over Syria, which he called \"a regional calamity with global ramifications.\"</p> <p>\"This is a serious and growing threat to international peace and security which requires security council action,\" Ban said. \"The international community should not look the other way as violence spirals out of control.\"</p> <p>UN officials said that Ban has become increasingly frustrated by the security council's deadock over Syria and had decided to speak out in his bluntest speech to date.</p> <p>He also called for those responsibility for atrocities in Syria to be held accountable, noting \"there is no statute of limitations for such extreme violence\", and placing most of the blame on the Assad regime. At present, Russian and Chinese objections are blocking the international criminal court from launching an investigation into war crimes, and Ban's comments were widely seen at the UN as a direct rebuke for their obstruction of the machinery of international justice.</p> <p>\"Brutal human rights abuses continue to be committed, mainly by the government, but also by opposition groups. Such crimes must not go unpunished,\" he said. \"It is the duty of our generation to put an end to impunity for international crimes, in Syria and elsewhere. It is our duty to give tangible meaning to the responsibility to protect.\"</p> <p>The responsibility to protect was a principle adopted by the UN in the 1990s, stating that the international community to intervene to protect civilian populations when their states were unwilling or unable to do so.</p> <p>Ban also had pointed words for two leaders due to speak at the same UN podium later in the week: Binyamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling for them to pull back from the brink of a new Middle East conflict, and to ratchet down their rhetoric.</p> <p>\"I \u2026 reject both the language of de-legitimisation and threats of potential military action by one state against another. Any such attacks would be devastating. The shrill war talk of recent weeks has been alarming,\" Ban said. \"Leaders have a responsibility to use their voices to lower tensions instead of raising the temperature and volatility of the moment.\"</p> <p>Netanyahu has been successful in displacing the Israel-Palestinian impasse from the international agenda by repeated threats to take military action against Iran. But he was warned by Ban that his government's policies in the West Bank were stoking renewed conflict.</p> <p>\"The two-state solution is the only sustainable option. Yet the door may be closing, for good. The continued growth of Israeli settlement settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory seriously undermines efforts toward peace. We must break this dangerous impasse,\" Ban said.</p>",

Hughes insists he didn't make a joke about the murders (\"I would never say anything about the death of anyone. It would be insensitive. I'm a grown man\"), but did refer to them to make the point that more civilians die in police custody than officers in the line of duty. Unfortunately for Hughes, there was a senior officer from Greater Manchester Police present, who walked out in disgust and whose reaction triggered the row.</p> <p>The force later tweeted that \"a senior officer walked out from Manchester's Comedy Store on Tuesday night after tasteless jokes at the expense of our fallen colleagues.\" Representing Greater Manchester Police, Ian Hanson later branded Hughes \"abhorrent,\" while a further tweet asked, \"is it acceptable to make jokes about the death of two police officers? Of course not. Apparently the Comedy Store in Manchester thinks it is.\" Hughes stood firm in the face of the attack, apologising for the offence caused \u2013 \"I'm sorry if somebody has become upset thinking I'm being derogatory.

There are quite a few big stars that came out of the SNL incubator, but so far he's definitely not one of them. He's internet famous maybe for some of the digital shorts, but that's different than being a big movie or TV star. ... Saturday Night Live hasn't been consistently good in years, and quite a few of the more recent alumni have done much better work and found greater notoriety after leaving, so maybe Samberg will have the same luck.\"</p> <p>Cue a debate about the current health of Saturday Night Live, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18464913\" title=\"\">SimonjenKIN arbitrating</a>: \"Saturday Night Live is literally as good as it has ever been and that is <em>somewhat good</em>.

Don't over-romanticise a certain period just because it had John Belushi or Mike Myers or Will Ferrell or whoever you idolise. They were all in terrible sketches too. Every episode of SNL has two or three good sketches, some mediocre sketches and some awful sketches. The monologue usually depends on who the guest star is (If it's Alec Baldwin or Zach Galifianakis then it will be funny, if it's Taylor Lautner? Probably less so ...). Anyway, I like Andy Samberg. He's very likable and he's also very funny (his recent Harvard Commencement Speech was great, his Nick Cage impression always makes me laugh).

  "<p>The NFL today stood by the controversial decision by replacement referees that resulted in handing victory to the Seattle Seahawks over the Green Bay Packers.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/25/seattle-seahawks-green-bay-packers-replacement-officials\">Seahawks were awarded a game-winning last second touchdown in a tussle involving several players and referees.</a> The controversial call is the latest and most high-profile highlighting the NFL's use of replacement referees, having locked out its regular officials in a dispute over pension payments.</p> <p>The NFL today released a statement supporting the decision and confirming the result. <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000066164/article/nfl-supports-decision-to-not-overturn-seahawks-touchdown?module=HP11_headline_stack\">The statement said:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>In Monday's game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks, Seattle faced a 4th-and-10 from the Green Bay 24 with eight seconds remaining in the game.</p> <p>Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson threw a pass into the end zone. Several players, including Seattle wide receiver Golden Tate and Green Bay safety M.D. Jennings, jumped into the air in an attempt to catch the ball.</p> <p>While the ball is in the air, Tate can be seen shoving Green Bay cornerback Sam Shields to the ground. This should have been a penalty for offensive pass interference, which would have ended the game. It was not called and is not reviewable in instant replay.</p> <p>When the players hit the ground in the end zone, the officials determined that both Tate and Jennings had possession of the ball. Under the rule for simultaneous catch, the ball belongs to Tate, the offensive player. The result of the play was a touchdown.</p> <p>Replay Official Howard Slavin stopped the game for an instant replay review. The aspects of the play that were reviewable included if the ball hit the ground and who had possession of the ball. In the end zone, a ruling of a simultaneous catch is reviewable. That is not the case in the field of play, only in the end zone.</p> <p>Referee Wayne Elliott determined that no indisputable visual evidence existed to overturn the call on the field, and as a result, the on-field ruling of touchdown stood. The NFL Officiating Department reviewed the video today and supports the decision not to overturn the on-field ruling following the instant replay review.</p> <p>The result of the game is final.</p> <p>Applicable rules to the play are as follows:</p> <p>A player (or players) jumping in the air has not legally gained possession of the ball until he satisfies the elements of a catch listed here.</p> <p>Rule 8, Section 1, Article 3 of the NFL Rule Book defines a catch:</p> <p>A forward pass is complete (by the offense) or intercepted (by the defense) if a player, who is inbounds:</p> <p>(a) secures control of the ball in his hands or arms prior to the ball touching the ground; and</p> <p>(b) touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and</p> <p>(c) maintains control of the ball long enough, after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, to enable him to perform any act common to the game (i.e., maintaining control long enough to pitch it, pass it, advance with it, or avoid or ward off an opponent, etc.).</p> <p>When a player (or players) is going to the ground in the attempt to catch a pass, Rule 8, Section 1, Article 3, Item 1 states:</p> <p>Player Going to the Ground. If a player goes to the ground in the act of catching a pass (with or without contact by an opponent), he must maintain control of the ball throughout the process of contacting the ground, whether in the field of play or the end zone. If he loses control of the ball, and the ball touches the ground before he regains control, the pass is incomplete. If he regains control prior to the ball touching the ground, the pass is complete.</p> <p>Rule 8, Section 1, Article 3, Item 5 states:</p> <p>Simultaneous Catch. If a pass is caught simultaneously by two eligible opponents, and both players retain it, the ball belongs to the passers. It is not a simultaneous catch if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control. If the ball is muffed after simultaneous touching by two such players, all the players of the passing team become eligible to catch the loose ball.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Proposals by the Scottish government to protect children fail to offer effective redress for human rights violations, according to Scotland's commissioner for children and young people.</p> <p>In a response to a consultation that ends on Tuesday, Tam Baillie said the children and young people (Scotland) bill contained no requirement for ministers to have \"due regard\" to the United Nations convention of the rights of the child (UNCRC), which was previously touted as the centrepiece of the new plans for Scotland.</p> <p>Launching its consultation in July 2012, the Scottish government said its proposals would promote the UNCRC and \"embed the rights of children and young people across the public sector\", in line with the convention.</p> <p>But Baillie said the UNCRC had yet to be given direct legal effect in Scots law, which means it cannot effectively be invoked in the courts. He said the Scottish and UK governments should work towards full incorporation of the UNCRC, so that public authorities would be required to comply with the convention's 54 articles.</p> <p>The UNCRC is an international agreement that protects the human rights of those under the age of 18. It was ratified by the UN general assembly in 1989 and adopted by the UK in 1991.</p> <p>Baillie said that, while he was generally encouraged by the direction of the bill, Scottish ministers should further the rights set out in the UNCRC. He said: \"Such a duty would set out for the first time explicitly in legislation ministerial commitment to, and responsibility for, the rights and duties set out in the UNCRC, and require ministers to identify specific measures to further the rights set out in the UNCRC.</p> <p>\"There are few explicit linkages between the proposed measures on children's rights and the remainder of the proposals for legislation.\"</p> <p>Baillie also called for more resources to extend his investigatory powers on behalf of children. He said: \"The document provides little detail regarding the model the Scottish government has in mind \u2026 [An] investigatory function for the commissioner relating to individual children and young people which is properly conceived, established and resourced would be a useful and important mechanism for children and young people to resolve alleged violations of their rights under the UNCRC.\"</p> <p>Baillie also expressed concern that parents of disabled children often struggle to find affordable childcare, and said \"flexible, inclusive early learning and childcare provision for disabled children should be a priority\".</p> <p>In response, a Scottish government spokesman said: \"We are committed to progressing the rights of children as set out in the UNCRC, and the duties we are proposing will advance this.</p> <p>\"We have also outlined proposals to extend the powers of the children's commissioner to undertake investigations on behalf of individual children, and are seeking views on these proposals. We have an excellent relationship with the commissioner and are working closely with his office to develop how this proposal would work in practice.\"</p>",

Races in different places: American League</h2> <p>Absolutely nothing is settled in the American League with 10 days to go in the regular season \u2013 one which, at least for me, seemed to just fly by. Texas have been cruising for months, and were maintaining a four-game lead heading into their clash with second-placed Oakland in the American League West. </p> <p>The A's had a lost weekend in the Bronx, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25004845&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_25004845&amp;v=3\">stunned on Saturday</a> by a four-run Yankees rally in the bottom of the 13th before succumbing in the 14th. It was a brutal loss, and when paired with <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24965739&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24965739&amp;v=3\">the walk-off homer by Russell Martin on Friday night</a>, it meant that the A's were stumbling somewhat into what is a monster four-game series with the Rangers at Arlington, where they have gone 8-16 since 2010. Oakland, which has the second best ERA in the AL, actually play the Rangers, who have the most potent offense in all of baseball, in seven of their final 10 games, so the opportunity is there to upend the mighty Texans.</p> <p>They got off to a bad start on Monday however, suffering a third awful loss in four days after losing to their AL West rivals <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25055653&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_25055653&amp;v=3\">5-4 in walk-off fashion</a>,<br>adding a game to the Rangers' lead. That means the slight chance that the A's can bring their fantasy season to a new level just got slighter. Don't expect BoMel, or as he is known to most of us the A's manager, Bob Melvin, to get too caught up in any of these scenarios, though.</p> <p>\"Knowing we are right behind Texas, [the series] probably does take on a little more significance,\" he said. \"But a win is a win. It doesn't count for any more than one, and a loss is the same way.\"</p> <p>True, but if the A's don't get wins, the Los Angeles Angels are just two games behind them in the wild-card race, streaking towards the finish line, putting up the kind of victories the baseball world has been waiting for since the end of June. After going 27-27 in July and August, the Angels have gone 14-7 in September to enter the \"better late than never\" category. <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120922&amp;content_id=38854680&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb\">Owner Arte Moreno made it clear this weekend</a> that no matter what happens in the team's final games, both general manager Jerry Dipoto and skipper Mike Scioscia will be back in 2013, just to make sure anyone thought otherwise. </p> <p>If the Angels do miss out on the postseason it will be the third straight year without playoff baseball in Anaheim, a prospect few thought possible after all the goodies brought into the team during the offseason, not to mention the big prize that came up in late April \u2013 Mike Trout. LA have six games remaining with last place Seattle, with a trip to Texas in between.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the Central Division, the Detroit Tigers are within a single game of the Chicago White Sox, which is a joke considering the Tigers got swept by the lowly Minnesota Twins on Sunday. They are getting big-time help from the White Sox, who followed their five-game winning streak with a five-game slide <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25061697&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_25061697&amp;v=3\">that they managed to snap on Monday</a>, with three of those losses coming at the hands of those pesky Angels. </p> <p>That's the bad news. The good news is that they are heading home for seven games against Cleveland, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25054873&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_25054873&amp;v=3\">who they defeated on Monday in the series opener</a>, and Tampa before they finish with three on the road against the Indians. The Tigers have seven against the Royals, who they defeated on Monday, and three against the Twins.</p> <p>The Rays, like the Angels, are pushing the limits of contention (we've seen this show before, haven't we?) \u2013 losing seven of eight, including a pair of dramatic losses in Baltimore and a trio of two-run defeats in the Bronx, before rebounding with five straight wins against Boston and Toronto. On Tuesday they are back in Fenway Park, and if the Red Sox had a pulse, you would think they may be after a bit of payback for 2011. The Red Sox have no pulse, and so there's every reason to think the Rays, down three games in the loss column to the Oakland A's, can find a way to sneak into the postseason once again. Plus, and this is big, they finish with three games against Baltimore in the Trop, and you just know those games are going to mean something to somebody. By the way, if you think the Rays are stressed heading into these mammoth games, just check <a href=\"atmlb.com/RSFrE8\">this</a> out.</p> <p>It's worth pointing out that Boston also have three more games with the O's, another series in which they will fail to pay back a team that destroyed them down the stretch in 2011. No one it seems has been able to stop the Orioles, who by the way have closed the gap in their run differential. The O's have now been outscored by six measly runs, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/aug/14/houston-astros-san-francisco-giants-washington-nationals-baltimore-orioles-pittsburgh\">much better than the -49 when this was last discussed in The Guardian</a>.</p> <p>That means their expected win-loss record should be 75-77. Instead, they heading into the last 10 days of the season with a realistic chance of besting the Yankees for the American League East crown, down just 1.5 games to New York after the Yanks beat the Twins on Monday and the O's split a doubleheader with the Jays. Wouldn't that be something? Indeed it would be, but with the Yanks cupcake schedule \u2013 two more with Minnesota, three at Toronto and three at home to Boston \u2013 don't count on it.</p> <p>Ten days, eight teams, five available playoff spots. Something has to give of course, but it won't happen until we have additional games to settle the score. Expect multiple ties at the end of the season and the ensuing schedule chaos, that's the prediction here \u2013 post yours below.</p> <p><a href=\"#planned\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>2.

Photograph: Michael Nelson/EPA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Nelson/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The NL scenario isn't nearly as much fun as what's going down in the AL. All three Senior Circuit divisions are done and dusted, with the San Francisco Giants, the Cincinnati Reds and the Washington Nationals \u2013 who have brought playoff baseball to DCr the first time since 1933 \u2013 taking the titles and earning what amounts to a first-round bye. One of the two wild-card spots is soon to be clinched by the Atlanta Braves, whose decision not to clean house after their famed 2011 collapse has been rewarded with a spot in the postseason, while the team that did clean house fared no better a season later. I know, two different situations, but I'm just sayin...</p> <p>Anyway, that leaves one spot with five teams in the running \u2013 at least, technically. Unlike the Rays, who have history on their side, it's hard to imagine any of the teams that are down at least four games making a run, and they are Arizona, Philadelphia \u2013 whose valiant efforts at getting back into the race seem to have fallen a bit short \u2013 and the Pittsburgh Pirates, who will not make the playoffs after an 8-22 run but who are still seeking the consolation prize, a .500 or above record for the first time in 19 seasons. That leaves the St Louis Cardinals, who hold 3.5-game leads on the Milwaukee Brewers and the Los Angeles Dodgers. </p> <p>The Cards are in control and have an added edge in that they are heading into Houston for three games \u2013 <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25057983&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_25057983&amp;v=3\">they won their first on Monday</a>) \u2013 before heading home to face the Reds and the Nats, who will have no other incentive than to knock out the Cards. If you ask me, I would do anything I could to try and knock the defending World Series champions out of the playoffs. More realistically, expect Dusty Baker and Davey Johnson to be resting their players over the final six games of the season.</p> <p>Of the two teams in pursuit, the Milwaukee Brewers are by far the most threatening challengers, having stormed back into the running out of nowhere. On 19 August they were 12.5 games behind Pittsburgh for the second wild-card spot. Today they are three out, and they were as close as one game down in the loss column on Friday, before suffering a couple of key losses. Still, they were 23-7 coming into Monday riding an offense that has remarkably become the NL's most lethal, a season after losing Prince Fielder to free-agency. Jonathan Lucroy, Corey Hart, Aramis Ramirez and of course Ryan Braun have put on quite a show over the past month. But will it be enough to unseat the Cards? The Brewers head to Cincinnati before coming home to play Houston and the scorching-hot Padres.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Dodgers, who have the same record as Milwaukee, seem far less threatening based on form. The Dodgers have the 10th-worst record in the NL over the past month at 12-18 \u2013 not what you're looking for when you're trying to sneak into the playoffs. Their pitching has been badly hit by injuries, but it got a boost on Sunday thanks to Clayton Kershaw's return to the rotation \u2013 he was able to stymie the Reds on a bad hip. In that <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25047339&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_25047339&amp;v=3\">5-3 victory</a>, we also saw some life from Adrian Gonzalez, who hit two home runs but has wildly underperformed following his big move over from Boston. </p> <p>The Dodgers now head to San Diego before heading home for games with the Rockies and the hated Giants. If they are still in it for those games, well, needless to say there will be quite a scene at Chavez Ravine. I can't see St Louis blowing a 3.5 game lead \u2013 nothing ever seems to go wrong for the Cards.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings\">Here are the latest regular standings</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/wildcard.jsp?ymd=20120924\">Here are the wildcard standings</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.coolstandings.com/baseball_standings.asp?sn=2012&amp;i=1\">Here are the coolstandings.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://images.paraorkut.com/img/funnypics/images/c/chewbacca_play_baseball-12404.jpg\">Here is a photo of Chewbacca throwing out the first pitch at Fenway Park</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"#planned\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>3.

Now that RA Dickey has probably put the plaque in his back pocket with a <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24987193&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24987193&amp;v=3\">19th victory on Saturday</a>, allowing two runs in eight innings in a rare home Mets victory against Miami, let's take a look at what's happening in the American League. Who will win the Cy Young? Well, let's start out with a thought from \"below the line\" in this space last week, when FranzFerdinand2 commented:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"I actually don't think that relief pitchers should get the Cy Young. Maybe in a year with no good candidates and an absolutely phenomenal best-of-all-time reliever, but they just don't pitch enough innings to be as valuable as a starting pitcher.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well Franz, you may be right, but the Cy Young Award goes to the \"best\" pitcher, not the most vaulable, as is the case with the MVP award. However, yes, writers have shown in the past that they overwhelmingly prefer to vote for starters over relievers. </p> <p>Having said that, can anyone ignore the season <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=rodnefe01&amp;t=p&amp;year=2012\">Francisco Rodney</a> has put together in Tampa? Not even the Yankees great<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/riverma01.shtml\"> Mariano Rivera</a> has put up an ERA resembling Rodney's 0.65, during which he accumulated 43 saves. Let me just be clear here \u2013 this is not about lessening Rivera's body of work, which is the best in the history of the modern-day closer. However, the lowest ERA of Rivera's career was 1.38 in 2005 \u2013 Rodney has more than cut that in half. In that season, either Rivera or Minnesota starter Johan Santana (first in strikeouts, second in IP, second in ERA) should have won the Cy Young Award. Instead, as was pointed out last week, Bartolo Col\u00f3n with his 21 wins and hefty 3.48 ERA<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2005.shtml#ALcya\"> took home the award</a> with an 84% share \u2013 Rivera garnered 49%. A pathetic result. </p> <p>The last reliever to win the Cy Young Award was<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=gagneer01&amp;t=p&amp;year=2003\"> Eric Gagne*</a> of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2003, with his 55 saves and 137 strikeouts in 82.1 innings and a 1.20 ERA. Second in the NL vote that season was <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2003.shtml#NLcya\">Jason Schmidt</a> of the Giants, 17-5 with a 2.34 ERA and 208 K's in 207.2 innings pitched. So there is a situation where a closer won the award and there was a starter who could have won. </p> <p>*Note: Gagne admitted to using HGH during a 2010 interview with the <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/21/sports/la-sp-simers21-2010feb21\">Los Angeles Times.</a> </p> <p>One more example \u2013 in 1992, when Oakland's Dennis Eckersley won the AL MVP and the AL Cy Young Award, just as Detroit's Justin Verlander did last season, Roger Clemens, then of the Red Sox, and the Orioles' Mike Mussina<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1992.shtml#NLcya\"> could also have won it, considering their statistics</a>. But the writers were right to give it to Eckersley, a more than deserving winner. </p> <p>What Gagne, Eckersley and Rivera in 2005 show is that the closer must put together some astronomical numbers to even get a sniff at the award, and that even then it might not be enough. Will Rodney's 0.65 ERA be enough to join the very small club of relievers with a Cy Young Award?</p> <p>Perhaps not with <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/verlaju01.shtml\">Justin Verlander</a> around. His encore to 2011 has been superb \u2013 first in innings pitched, second by just one strikeout at 223, and the second-best ERA amongst starters at 2.74. Chuck in six complete games for good measure and you couldn't fault anyone for giving him yet another accolade. </p> <p>Tampa's second Cy Young Award candidate, <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/priceda01.shtml\">David Price</a>, tops Verlander in wins and ERA but not much else. Then there is <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/weaveje02.shtml\">Jered Weaver</a> of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, who threw a no-hitter in May and has the best WHIP in the league, while the White Sox's<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/salech01.shtml\"> Chris Sale</a> also has enough to be considered. So does <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hernafe02.shtml\">Felix Hern\u00e1ndez</a> in Seattle. </p> <p>I'm pushing for Rodney. When Eckersley won the award he allowed 17 earned runs; Gagne allowed 12. Rodney has allowed just five earned runs in close to 70 innings pitched, and that is a big enough cartwheel for me.</p> <p><a href=\"#planned\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p> </p> <h2>4. Book review \u2013 a look back at 9/28/11</h2> <p>Thursday will mark the one-year anniversary of what many have called the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/sep/28/wild-card-live-red-sox-rays\">greatest single night of regular-season baseball in the history of the grand ol' game. </a>That's quite a statement, I know, but there is simply no equivalent to the compelling evening of high-stakes hardball that took place on 28 September 2011. From there, depending on who you root for, it gets even better or a whole lot worse. For neutrals, it was a night that fans will never forget and if you watched it happen, it's hard to imagine the \u2013 and please forgive the cliche \u2013 perfect storm coming around again to provide us all with such all out drama. </p> <p>That may be one reason why Paul Kocak wrote <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Baseballs-Starry-Night-Reliving-League/dp/0615622305/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top\">Baseball's Starry Night: Reliving Major League Baseball's 2011 Wild Card Night of Shock and Awe</a></em> \u2013 a book that takes the reader through the evening from the perspective of all four teams playing for their playoff lives: the Cardinals, Braves, Rays and Red Sox. Stories from fans and real-time tweets recall the tale, along with Kocak's vivid recollection of the events, most of which he timestamps, which is a fun way of recapping the evening. </p> <p>Describing how the book came about, Kocak said: \"My recollection is that I woke up the next day, floored by events the night before (not for the first time in my life floored by events the night before) and mused, 'Someone ought to write a book about this, and it isn't going to be me.'</p> <p>Thanks to a pep talk and some guidance from a friend, Kocak, who lives in Syracuse, New York and is a fan of the San Francisco Giants, put together a comprehensive guide to 28 September that also provides some history of prior dramatic baseball finishes, and a little bit of a forecast of what is to come. </p> <p>Once upon a time, when there were just 16 teams in baseball and the winner of each league advanced to the World Series, the National League had a three-game playoff to break regular-season ties, as in 1951 when Bobby Thomson's New York Giants beat the Brooklyn Dodgers after he hit the \"Shot heard around the World\" off of Ralph Branca. </p> <p>Interestingly, as Kocak points out, the AL had a different format to decide who would move on when two teams were tied after 154 games \u2013 a one-game playoff \u2013 which he also points out was part of the regular season, not the postseason. Kocak tells the story of the Indians and Red Sox squaring off in 1948 for the right to reach the World Series: Cleveland won, preventing what would have been the only all-Boston Fall Classic. Some 64 years later, we once again have a one-game-for-all-the-marbles situation in baseball, this time for the right to reach the Divisional Series, which will play out for the first time in just a few weeks. </p> <p>If you're looking for a good read while getting set for the latest chapter of October heroics, <em>Baseball's Starry Night: Reliving Major League Baseball's 2011 Wild Card Night of Shock and Awe</em>, makes for fun, nostalgic reading about a historic evening of baseball.</p> <p><a href=\"#planned\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>5.

  "<p>An Iranian MP has criticised the country's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for taking more than a hundred people with him to the UN general assembly in New York, saying the large entourage had travelled there for \"a picnic\".</p> <p>At a time when many Iranians are struggling with economic hardship because of sanctions, almost 140 people have joined their president in his final visit to New York. Most of them are staying at the city's luxurious Warwick hotel, where suites can cost up to \u00a31,000 a night.</p> <p>The president is expected to address the general assembly on Wednesday in a speech that is highly anticipated by both his opponents in Iran and those watching him for any hint about the country's disputed nuclear programme or Tehran's support for Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria.</p> <p>Initially, visas had been requested for some 160 people, but the semi-official Fars news agency reported that about 20 applications were turned down, including those for members of his cabinet and two ministers. Other Iranian sources, however, have put the numbers of those banned from US trip as high as 60.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's chief of staff and close confidant, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who is despised by the rival conservatives as the head of a \"deviant current\" within the president's inner circle, and the foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi are accompanying him for the UN visit.</p> <p>In recent days, Iranian parliamentarians and media have spoken against the number of people travelling along with Ahmadinejad to the US, a country Iranian leaders depict as their sworn enemy.</p> <p>\"Many of [the people accompanying the president] have only travelled there for a picnic,\" protested the deputy head of the parliamentary committee on national security, Mansour Haghighatpour, according to the semi-official Ilna news agency.</p> <p>It is not the first time Ahmadinejad has come under fire for taking many of his allies to such a high-profile visit. He has faced criticism in previous years for having his staff's families along with him abroad.</p> <p>A prominent Iranian cartoonist, Touka Neyestani, reacted by publishing a cartoon on the website of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, depicting Ahmadinejad wearing an \"I love New York\" T-shirt.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a video showing Ahmadinejad reacting to the uproar about his companions while passing through gates at the UN also fuelled controversy. Many web users who shared the video on social networking websites said the president had sworn at his opponents while others insisted his words were, in fact, not clear.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad is in his final year of office and under the current Iranian law cannot run for a third term. After a series of setbacks in a power struggle with conservatives, especially over his staunch support for Mashaei, the president has lost a great deal of influence over Iranian politics, prompting many to view him as an increasingly lame duck, but despite his dwindling power at home, he is still grabbing headlines outside.</p> <p>While in New York, the Iranian president gave interviews to the American media, including CNN's Piers Morgan, and invited a group of journalists for a breakfast meeting which the New Yorker's David Remnick said was promoted as an exchange of ideas but turned out \"to be a group interview\".</p> <p>In response to Morgan's questions about his views on homosexuality, Ahmadinejad said: \"I'm sorry. Let me ask you this. Do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality? Homosexuality ceases procreation. Who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly, and others do not accept your behaviour, that they're denying your freedom?\"</p> <p>In reaction to Ahmadinejad's comments, the Iranian journalist Omid Memarian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Omid_M/status/250417679310131200\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \"#Ahmadinejad's response to #gay issue was not much different than what Romney or Santorum might h[ave] said.\"</p> <p>Reacting to Remnick's question about an Iranian institute recently raising the bounty on the head of Salman Rushdie amid controversy over an anti-Islam film, Ahmadinejad responded: \"Salman Rushdie, where is he now? \u2026 There is no news of him. Is he in the United States? If he is in the US, you shouldn't broadcast that, for his own safety.\"</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's visit to New York has also sparked demonstrations in front of his hotel and the UN headquarters.</p>",

However, any illusions or fantasies that they are a dubstep <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/celebrity/article-1090505/I-hope-awful-vain-man-swallows-worm-chokes-Im-A-Celebrity-star-David-Van-Days-Dollar-bandmate-lets-rip.html\" title=\"\">Dollar</a> are dashed by the realisation that they are cousins. That's a shame, because it means we can't read their songs for covert references to each other, for signs of satisfaction or spite.</p> <p>Of course, that pleasure \u2013 of knowing who the song is about \u2013 increases exponentially as the fame of the artist increases. That's partly why Fleetwood Mac's Rumours was so thrilling \u2013 was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ul-cZyuYq4\" title=\"\">Go Your Own Way</a> really a kiss-off from Lindsey to Stevie?

Although Sedgie Ogilvy and Max Heath can never provide that level of intrigue, and may remain a bloggers' delight, Victory is still a Rumours/Dare of an album in that it is very melodic and the songs deal with affairs of the heart. But it's also rooted, in terms of rhythm and production, in what is coming to be regarded as the second golden age of R&amp;B, that late-90s/early-00s era when Timbaland, Dallas Austin and Rodney Jerkins made it cool to be jerky and singers such as Aaliyah and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq14JocSAs\" title=\"\">Mya</a> provided a cool, controlled alternative to the more effusively emotional Whitney and Mariah.</p> <p>Child Actor are one of those acts currently making a mockery of the idea of the big budget and the expensive studio: the tracks on Victory sound huge, lush and impressively \"professional\". Ogilvy and Heath are being credited with \"breathing life into R&amp;B\" but they're hardly the first to reinvestigate and reinvigorate the genre \u2013 in fact, you could easily argue that, after How to Dress Well, the Weeknd, Grimes, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/25/new-band-nite-jewel\" title=\"\">Nite Jewel</a>, Polica et al, indie-fying R&amp;B is less a radical notion than an entirely outplayed one. But Child Actor do it well, incorporating elements of electronica from synth-pop to Skrillex. Ogilvy's vocals are often Auto-Tuned and only lightly melismatic, the rest of the time relying on a breathy whisper that is calculatedly wan. At times they sound like Kraftwerk fronted by a depressed Dusty. Saint Etienne, basically. The titles are familiar verging on shopworn (Release Me \u2013 what, again?), but that may be a deliberate bid to recontextualise old (original/60s) R&amp;B tropes by placing them in a modern setting. Despite being in danger of drowning the listener in sugar, Heath is always at hand with an angular beat or a keyboard bloop to make sure things are never too saccharine. \"Would you like to sleep with me?\" Ogilvy sings at one point, which, given the proximity of her cousin, is more creepy than sweet.

  "<p>We have always shaped the environment around us in order to achieve a particular function. Today, our homes should provide comfort, our workplaces should support productivity, and our hospitals should make us healthy. The choices we make when designing and operating these spaces are fundamental in achieving the desired outcome and determining how we live and feel.</p> <p>There have been a large number of studies into the effect of workplace design on employees in a corporate setting, but much less focus on other workplace environments such as hospitals. In the healthcare setting, studies have predominantly focused on the effect of the environment on patients rather than employees.</p> <p>There is now widespread consensus that a hospital's physical environment can have a big effect on patient outcomes and recovery times. Factors such as space, lighting, use of colour, acoustics, noise levels, smells and the degree of control a patient has over their environment can all have an impact on the wellbeing and mood of the individual.</p> <p>Control over the environment, for example, has been shown to be linked to a person's real or perceived ability to determine their own outcome and make positive choices. Noise can have a particularly adverse effect on patient sleep patterns, which can be particularly problematic given that nurses are often accustomed to high noise levels and will not notice sounds that may disturb patients, particularly at night. Brain development of premature babies can also be disrupted by a noisy environment and/or by artificial lighting. Alzheimer's patients exhibit less aggression, anxiety and fewer psychotic symptoms when they are placed in private rooms with their own personal objects around them.</p> <p>This understanding of the role of the environment in patient care has advanced to the extent that the Department of Health now has specific guidelines that must be met in the design of new hospitals.</p> <p>However, in contrast to patient care, less attention has been given to the effect that the hospital environment has on the wellbeing and productivity of healthcare staff themselves. And yet, research has shown that levels of staff motivation and job satisfaction can have a direct impact on patient outcomes. By strengthening the bond between the working environment and optimum levels of staff satisfaction to improve patient care, more attention should be given to the parts of hospital design directly affecting healthcare staff. In particular, physical layouts and interior ambience related to communication, productivity and team working.</p> <p>One organisation giving serious consideration to these matters is <a href=\"http://www.merseycare.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Mersey Care NHS Trust</a>. Here, the senior management team has recognised that the physical work environment should be viewed as an important operational tool which influences the way staff provide care.</p> <p>Arup have worked with Mersey Care to provide input into the design of a number of new mental health facilities. The overall aim was to ensure that design interventions reflect the needs of all user groups, including healthcare staff.</p> <p>Studies were carried out at 18 wards to understand the core activities of all staff groups.</p> <p>In most organisations, changes in workplace design are naturally implemented through a new building or refurbishment of existing spaces. In addition to the obvious improvements this generally brings, many organisations now use such opportunity as a catalyst for a much wider culture change, fundamentally rethinking how work is arranged and how services are delivered.</p> <p>Healthcare organisations can learn from organisations like Mersey Care and better utilise changes in the design of spaces as a catalyst for cultural changes, which will ultimately facilitate improved delivery of services.</p> <p>There is clearly an opportunity for health trusts with large property estates to consider these issues \u2013 in particular improvements in the working environment \u2013 when planning interventions around the efficiency, cost, environmental impacts, and health outcomes for patients.</p> <p>Other organisations have clearly shown that by focusing on space design as an enabler of change, a wide range of benefits can be realised; for an organisation like the NHS, this is an opportunity not to be missed.</p> <p><em>Mary-Clare Race is an associate working within the Consulting practice at Arup in London.

Not that Gus shies from addressing mute objects \u2013 a can of Spam, a tombstone and even his penis are all beneficiaries of Eastwood's words of wisdom.</p> <p>Despite this navel-gazing, Trouble with the Curve marks the first time since Wolfgang Petersen directed him in the 1993 thriller In the Line of Fire that Clint has handed the reins to another film-maker. This time it's Robert Lorenz, Eastwood's longtime assistant, who delivers a highly accomplished directorial debut \u2013 albeit one that stays well within the bounds of Hollywood's cookie-cutter approach to the family portrait.</p> <p>Gus is a legendary baseball scout who works for the Atlanta Braves and definitely wouldn't get along with the sabermetrics acolytes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142852/moneyball\" title=\"\">Moneyball</a>. With three months left on his contract, he heads over to the Carolinas to check out a prospect. Joining Gus is his workaholic attorney daughter Mickey, who is played by Amy Adams. She's angling for partner at her law firm but takes off a few days at the behest of a family friend who's concerned about Gus's failing eyesight.</p> <p>As the business side of the trip gets tricky, the uneasy father-daughter relationship thaws. Gus's beloved wife died when Mickey was six and he sent his daughter to live with relatives. There's a reason for this, which Lorenz touches on in a perfunctory manner that jars with the overall polish of the movie. Mickey's personal inhibitions are further challenged when she falls for an uncomplicated love interest played by Justin Timberlake.</p> <p>Warner Bros has a strong stable of award contenders this season and, while this will not be a major contender across all categories, the performances are strong and there could be a chance for Eastwood and Adams. It's no surprise that Trouble with the Curve bears all the hallmarks of Lorenz's mentor: prickly codger with soft centre, feisty young gal who inspires him to re-engage with life and unlikeable fringe players who get their comeuppance. Not<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/35209/unforgiven\" title=\"\"> Unforgiven</a>-style, you understand, although you sense Gus wouldn't mind taking a pop at anyone who gets his goat.</p>",
  "<p>When he was 15, Jim ran drugs for a cult group. When I first heard his story, I was shocked \u2013 not just that the group was running drugs, but that they had directed one of their youngest recruits to do the dirty work for them. Then I learned why it made sense in a technical sort of way: the cult leaders reasoned that the older members, if caught, would face serious sentences and lifetime records, whereas the kids could get away with an unpleasant but not life-altering juvenile detention. It was a matter of using kids to do what the grown-ups didn't want to risk doing themselves.</p> <p>In a tactical sense, religious fundamentalists in America appear to have taken a page from the same book. The constitution and the law prohibits adults from, say, establishing ministries within public schools aimed at proselytizing to the children during school hours. But a growing number of religious activists have come to realize that it's technically legal if they get the kids to do their work for them. OK, so religious proselytizing is not the same thing as running drugs \u2013 but manipulating kids to exploit legal loopholes isn't pretty wherever it happens.</p> <p>This tactic has been tested and deployed in a great number of situations already in schools across the country. Right now, a large group of fundamentalist organizations and church denominations is making a big bet that they will be able to pull it off on a national scale, starting in 2013.</p> <p>If you go to the <a href=\"http://everyschool.com/\">Every Student Every School</a> website, you'll see that their dozens of promotional videos are first-rate. The music is great, the cameras are professionally handled, the sound bites are short and snappy. Their message is very clear.</p> <p>As ESES's name implies, their idea is to proselytize every student in every public school in America through an aggressive \"Adopt-a-School\" campaign. And the way to do it is to have the kids do what grownups are not allowed to do \u2013 establish full-fledged missionary operations inside the schools. A clever <a href=\"http://everyschool.com/adopt_map\">map</a> allows viewers to click on their state and type in their area code, revealing every school in the district and determine whether it has been \"adopted\" by churches or other religious organizations. Kids from those entities are instructed to conduct daily prayer groups during the school day, distribute religious literature and are given numerous other ideas for practicing or promoting their religion at school.</p> <p>\"We must help our teenagers get serious about sharing their faith with those God has place in their lives,\" an article on the ESES website advises. According to ESES's <a href=\"http://everyschool.com/campus-prayer-guide\">Campus Prayer Guide</a>, evangelical Christian students are in a \"strategic position\" to proselytize \"unchurched\" peers, and advises these students to \"consider every school a PRAYER ZONE.\"</p> <p>Who is behind ESES and its sponsoring group, <a href=\"http://everyschool.com/campus-alliance\">Campus Alliance</a>? It is backed by nearly 60 large-scale fundamentalist initiatives and church denominations, including the Fellowship for Christian Athletes, Young Life, Youth with a Mission, Campus Crusade for Christ (CRU) and the Life Book Movement, a project of the Gideons International.</p> <p>ESES is the fulfillment of a strategy that has been unfolding for the past few decades. It started with student groups rightfully claiming certain free speech rights in public schools. After all, kids can and should be allowed to talk about their religion with their friends at school. It led to a legal <a href=\"http://documents.mccormickfoundation.org/Civics/programs/Education/FreedomExpress/ExhibitGuide/pages/westsidevmergens.htm\">distinction</a> by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor that seems more simple on the surface than it is in practice \u2013 the distinction between private speech by students and speech that is linked to school authorities or the authority of the school.</p> <p>This distinction was perhaps too simplistic. After all, when students give class presentations, they don't have a right to express just any views on any subject they choose. Schools routinely restrict student speech \u2013 directing kids to speak politely, or speak in turn, for instance \u2013 when it makes sense for educational purposes, and even sometimes when it doesn't. This distinction ultimately led to what some fundamentalist activists took to calling a \"<a href=\"http://saturate.thelifebook.com/?page_id=26\">God-given loophole</a>\".</p> <p>Tomorrow, 26 September, for instance, marks the 22nd annual \"<a href=\"http://syatp.com/\">See You at the Pole</a>\" prayer event, in which children nationwide gather around the flagpole at their schools and pray in as ostentatious a manner as possible. The event is purportedly \"student-led\". But at the SYAP I attended, local pastors directed kids in their youth groups to join, told them what to do, loaned them sound amplification equipment, participated in the event and hosted an after-party at a local mega-church, which was staffed with adults wearing t-shirts with the SYAP logo.</p> <p>These initiatives are \"student-led\" in the same sense that a pee-wee soccer league is student-led. Yes, it's the kids kicking the ball, but you have to be pretty detached from reality to imagine that there would be kids on that playing field in the first place without the grown-ups organizing and funding their activities, and cheering them from the sidelines.</p> <p>Bible distribution programs are pursuing the same tactic. For years, adult missionaries with the Gideons International <a href=\"http://ffrf.org/faq/state-church/item/14034-bible-distribution-in-public-schools\">sought to distribute</a> Bibles in public schools \u2013 with limited success, as adults are not allowed to hand out religious literature on public school grounds. But give a stash of evangelical tracts to a kid, and the kid is allowed to do it for them. In the past three years since its inception, <a href=\"http://thelifebook.com/\">the Life Book movement</a>, a \"peer evangelism\" project of the Gideons International, claims to have distributed over 3.4m evangelical tracts, written with teens in mind, to kids on school campuses nationwide.</p> <p>In many instances, such activities like this will appear as a nuisance at the margin, one of those violations of the spirit of the constitution, if not the letter, that would seem to be more about symbolism and principle than anything else. But in this case, it would be na\u00efve to imagine that that is the end game. The goal of such initiatives, quite clearly, is to normalize the idea that public schools should be venues for religious activity. Once you've got churches entangling themselves in the schools, it is very hard to remove them.</p> <p>New York City's department of education found this out the hard way. After being forced by the courts to allow churches <a href=\"http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/5470/rent-free_religion_in_new_york%E2%80%99s_public_schools/\">rent-free</a> access to space within public schools, a new constituency was created: namely, churchgoers and church leaders accustomed to having state-subsidized houses of worship. Even though the second circuit court of appeals recognized that there was a serious constitutional concern here, the department of education has run into <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/27/1068555/-New-York-City-Can-t-Get-Bronx-Evangelical-Church-Out-of-Its-Public-School\">heavy political resistance</a>, which they are still battling today.</p> <p>Defenders of such religious initiatives call their efforts a fight for \"religious freedom.\" But largely what they seek are special privileges for their religion alone. The normalization of the integration of church and school comes from very particular strands of the Christian faith; not every Christian denomination, or every religion, is involved in this kind of activity. Mainline Christian denominations, to give just one example, are largely excluded. The work of ESES and its friends creates precisely those ills against which the constitutional principle of the \"separation of church and state\" was intended to defend.</p> <p>Such mixing of church and school is sure to cause conflict and division \u2013 especially among parents who are not represented by the school-churches. It will burden public school officials who already have enough to deal with in terms of instruction and management, and are frankly not equipped to handle sectarian conflicts in school communities. But the groups involved in these efforts won't be deterred by that division. In fact, many of them welcome it. Many fundamentalists simply do not accept public schools as legitimate enterprises in the first place. They see public education as secular education, and therefore intrinsically hostile to their religion.</p> <p>At their core, they do not accept that we live in a diverse society with a secular form of government. If their activities degrade support for the public schools or even destroy them, they will not be sorry to see them go.</p>",
  "<p>Some may doubt the constitutional propriety of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/25/bbc-apologises-queen-abu-hamza\" title=\"\">Queen's reported intervention</a> in the Hamza case, but it is difficult to fault her question: why was the \"preacher of hate\" allowed to run free for so long? Her Majesty's questioning was shared by Muslims who had once used the Finsbury Park mosque, and felt terrorised when Hamza and his henchmen seized control of it, turning it into a place of hate.</p> <p>Some will claim the long-running Hamza saga shows the extent to which human rights have got so out of hand and that they need to be \"rebalanced\", that is, cut. Some will claim the then Labour government was soft on Hamza because of a multicultural-inspired fear of upsetting Muslims \u2013 a claim undermined by the fact that the same Labour government took part in the widely opposed Iraq invasion, and allegedly colluded in the torture of Muslim terrorism suspects held by the Americans.</p> <p>But when, as now seems as certain as anything in the saga dating back to the late 1990s, he is extradited to the US, Hamza will take some secrets with him. How could he turn a north London mosque into a place to foment violent jihad under the noses of the security services?</p> <p>The police had their suspicions \u2013 local Muslims were passing information about events that struck them as extremist, and even the head of state was puzzled. At least part of the reason for not stopping him was that those who operate on Her Majesty's secret service thought he was a harmless buffoon who was also a useful source of information on other extremists. During Hamza's 2005-06 trial in the UK, it emerged that over a three-year period, the cleric had repeatedly met MI5 and special branch. A close associate of Hamza told the Guardian the cleric was an \"unwitting informant\" for MI5, passing on information against jihadists whose views he considered more extreme than his.</p> <p>During his UK trial, Hamza said that in his many meetings with counter-terrorism officials he believed a deal operated whereby his activities would be tolerated as long as they were targeting only foreign soil. Hamza told the Old Bailey that during one meeting with officials, he asked if his fiery sermons were a problem and was told: \"You have freedom of speech. You don't have anything to worry about as long as we don't see blood on the streets.\"</p> <p>Credence for Hamza's claim comes from an unlikely source. Reda Hassaine was a former MI5 operative <a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/focus/story/0,,439639,00.html\" title=\"\">who infiltrated the mosque</a>. He says Hamza was allowed to operate by the security services as long as he did not threaten Britain's national security. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/08/terrorism.world1\" title=\"\">senior French intelligence chief</a> told the Guardian in 2006 that for years, Britain had failed to take action against him despite being given evidence that he had extensive involvement in terrorism, including recruiting men for terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Former mosque worshippers say they told police about Hamza's activities, including a meeting in the mosque to pledge allegiance to Osama bin Laden. Mufti Abdul Barkatulla, a former trustee of the mosque, says police were repeatedly asked to curb Hamza. He says that in 2000, trustees asked police to act after Hamza supporters placed a poster in the mosque advertising a meeting where loyalty could be pledged to Osama bin Laden. Barkatulla says police did nothing. \"There was enough evidence for the police to do something against Hamza for years before 2003.\"</p> <p>It appears that MI5 saw the mosque as a \"honeypot\", and were prepared to let Hamza operate and monitor which extremists came, and also collect Hamza's information. The mosque attracted people from north Africa, especially Algerians, who came to London after a bitter civil war in their homeland. At the time, MI5 thought that the Islamist terrorist threat to Britain was more likely posed by people from north Africa, not British-born extremists. Furthermore as Hamza radicalised youngsters, MI5's knowledge of the extremist threat was poor. Then, its expertise was in the threat posed by the Soviets and from Irish republican terrorism.</p> <p>In this void, Hamza was deemed to be sufficiently useful to be allowed to operate.</p>",

Nothing daunted, we put on our waterproofs, picked&#xa0;up our tools and set off to cut back overhanging foliage on the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/clevelandway/\">Cleveland Way</a> at Stoupe Beck.

Potash is in the news at present as plans for another mine near Whitby have just been announced. The sun was shining and the view in front of us was of a lovely woodland and a field of sheep. Behind us loomed the bulk of the mine buildings. It all seemed rather incongruous. </p> <p>New steps are put in and old ones cleaned up and repaired, but there is still much to do. I use an old fashioned sickle and rather blunt shears to clear a way through the mini-jungle that is now the path.</p> <p>The following day was stunningly beautiful and out Coasties job was clearing a section of the Cleveland Way just south of Scarborough. Long grass, nettles, briars and overhanging gorse and willow were all making this section of the National Trail too narrow. However, one of my tasks was rather dispiriting, clearing masses of rubbish from around a bench, including the mesh from several portable barbecues, you can imagine what they do to small mammals and birds which get their legs caught in them.

Professor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ian-cram\">Ian Cram</a>, who teaches and researches comparative constitutional law at Leeds University says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was the Victorian constitutional writer Walter Bagehot who <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/4/3/5/4351/4351-h/4351-h.htm\">stated that the Queen had</a> \"the right to be consulted, the right to encourage and the right to warn\". This suggests a fairly limited role for the monarch \u2013 after all on this view her ministers remain free to reject her advice. In some ways that is what her actions amount to here. She is encouraging a particular course of action to be taken by the executive.</p> <p>It is not as if she is rejecting her ministers' advice which would raise an altogether much more serious constitutional set of constitutional questions. Had her ministers steadfastly refused to take a course of action which she was urging, there is a view (held by some more venerable constitutional writers such Anson in 1913) that she could dismiss her ministers. This view would now seem outdated in the modern democratic era. Others argue that if the government was proposing a fundamentally undemocratic alteration to the constitution (eg abolishing regular elections) then the Queen would be entitled to refuse to assent to legislation and dismiss the government.</p> </blockquote> <p>What about in this case? </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is little actual political controversy over the Queen's intervention because there was no party political opposition (from the main Westminster political parties at least) to the launching of criminal investigations against Abu Hamza. </p> <p>However, even this limited role of \"encouraging\" could in theory bring the Queen into political controversy, especially where she appeared to be supporting the position of one political party at Westminster and implicitly critical of another. This might make the institution of the monarchy vulnerable to claims that it is partisan and no longer above the fray of party politics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Pete Weatherby QC, from Garden Court North chambers believes the Queen's intervention was inappropriate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"There is nothing objectionable about the Queen having an opinion, nor expressing it in private to a friend or even a journalist, although in the latter case she takes her chance, as the journalist's stock in trade is publishing information and the opinions of prominent people. However, it is objectionable in a modern democracy, for an unelected head of state to use his or her position to lobby a minister of state, as has been reported in this case. </p> <p>Hence, Frank Gardner and the BBC were wrong to publish the Queen's view, or that of anyone else, if expressed confidentially and it does not raise any public interest, but they were right to report that she had made representations to ministers.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<h2>WELL, WELL, WELL, MY MICHEL</h2> <p>Younger Fiver readers may be unaware that, before he became the subject of a Guns N' Roses song and a professional blazer providing ammunition for tea-timely football emails that are sick of writing about Plain Old JT, Uefa president Michel Platini was a footballer. And not just any old common-or-garden journeyman, but a very fine player indeed. He won lots of trophies, including French and Italian league and cup titles, Big Cup, Euro Vase When It Was Good, Now Defunct Euro Pot and Euro 84, not to mention numerous Player of the Year gongs.</p> <p>Despite all these decorations, we can only assume it's a constant source of regret to the French legend that he famously passed up the opportunity to get his hands on a 1982 Milk Cup runners-up medal out of laziness, having eschewed the opportunity to sign for Tottenham that season because England doesn't have a winter break. And 30 years later he's still banging that particular drum, having told Lahn's Lahn Enan Stannah that the English game will have to take a month's holiday in 2022, to facilitate the World Cup awarded so mysteriously to the mega-rich molten furnace of Qatar.</p> <p>\"I hope it will be held in winter,\" said Platini. \"We have to go to Qatar when it is good for everybody to participate. What is better for the fans?\" As the president of an organisation so fabled for its consideration for \"the fans\" that it handed a third of the tickets for last season's Big Cup final to sponsors and charged up to \u20ac370 (excluding very large booking fee) for those available to everyone else, it is heartwarming to see this latest example of Platini's concern for the little guy. That said, one can't but feel it might have been better demonstrated by him voting for somebody else to host that particular 2022 jamboree.</p> <p>\"If we stop [the European season] from 2 November to 20 December it means instead of finishing in May, we stop in June; it is not a big problem,\" he said. \"It is for the good of the World Cup, the most important competition in the world.\" If the 2022 tournament is so important that it must be played in Qatar, off the top of our head the Fiver can't actually see anything ridiculously preposterous with this proposition. The maximum temperature in Doha during November is around 29 degrees centigrade, compared to the skin-crackling 41 of June and July. In such cool and balmy conditions, under the managerial guidance of Plain Old JT, England's brave boys will surely fancy their chances of going all the way.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"Football is like a pyramid.

  "<p>Female athletes won 38% of Australia's medal tally at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. The same year, two professional women sat down to discuss why there were so few women on sport and business boards and what could be done. This was the genesis of <a href=\"http://www.womenonboards.org.au/\" title=\"\">Women on Boards</a>, an enterprise created to improve the gender balance in Australian boardrooms.</p> <p>Fast-forward to 2012, the London Olympics is over, women took home <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/aug/06/team-gb-medal-winners-background#sex\" title=\"\">more than a third of the medals won by Team GB</a>, and Women on Boards, having helped 1,000 Australian women achieve board roles, is rolling out across the UK.</p> <p>Britain favours a voluntary approach to achieving gender diversity in the boardroom, rather than the mandatory quota system that has increased female representation on boards in Norway from less than 10% in 2003 to more than 40%.</p> <p>Australia is ahead of the UK in the number of women on the boards of publicly listed companies. It introduced gender diversity provisions into its corporate governance code several years ahead of the UK, and Women on Boards and other groups have been pushing hard on the issue.</p> <p>The proportion of women on the boards of Australia's 200 largest publicly listed companies has increased from 8.3% in January 2010 to 14.6% in September 2012. However, there is a sense that appointment rates may be slowing. For the first eight months of this year, 24% of <a href=\"http://www.companydirectors.com.au/Director-Resource-Centre/Governance-and-Director-Issues/Board-Diversity/Statistics\" title=\"\">new appointments</a> to the boards of ASX 200 companies were women, compared with 28% in 2011.</p> <p>In the UK, the percentage of women on the boards of the 100 largest companies has risen over the past year to a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17349832\" title=\"\">record 15.6%</a>. And in the last six months, 35% of new board appointments to FTSE 250 companies have been women.</p> <p>Beyond the FTSE and ASX, the 2012 Women on Boards Australian boardroom <a href=\"http://www.womenonboards.org.au/pubs/bdi/2012/index.htm\" title=\"\">diversity index</a> reveals that credit unions, health insurance funds and sports bodies have shown small increases in the percentage of women on their boards since 2007, but female directors comprise no more than a quarter of board members in any sector.</p> <p>Similar research by Women on Boards into UK governing bodies across a wide range of sectors shows that the number of women occupying board roles over here is not a cause for celebration either. In 2012, housing associations fared best with 40% of board roles occupied by women, followed by NHS foundation trusts (37%), top charities (34%), government departments (32%) and non-departmental public bodies (28%).</p> <p>These sectors all receive significant public funding and we believe they should be adopting targets of 40%&#xa0;men, 40% women and 20% of either gender for their boards. In Australia, the federal government has adopted a 40:40:20 target at departmental level for its boards and committees. Women on Boards is pushing for this to be mandated for all bodies that receive public funding. The target has encouraged government departments to assess board appointment processes and increase the overall level of governance and probity around the recruitment of new members. Indications are that boards are already starting to look farther afield for directors.</p> <p>Moreover, the target will increase the focus on creating demand for board roles rather than on the supply of talented women to take top roles. This is critical to ensuring women receive real opportunities for board roles, as it will force companies and search firms to reframe and widen their selection criteria to include areas where women tend to work, such as marketing, HR and in senior roles across the public sector.</p> <p>In Australia, Women on Boards' emphasis on opening access to board vacancies to aspirant women has led to directorships for a new group of qualified and experienced women who were not on the collective radar of search firms and chairs of organisations. As a result, there are now more than 15,000 women in Australia who are considering their first or additional board roles.</p> <p>Following our London launch this week, UK organisations can post a board vacancy with <a href=\"http://www.womenonboards.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Women on Boards UK</a>. And more than 600 women have already registered in the hope of bringing their skills and talents to a boardroom.</p> <p>\u2022 Claire Braund is co-founder and executive director of Women on Boards. <a href=\"http://www.womenonboards.co.uk/my/events/\" title=\"\">Events</a> are scheduled across the UK this autumn</p>",
  "<p>Outgoing BBC chief operating officer Caroline Thomson has suggested that Lord Justice Leveson could use the broadcasting regulation model as the basis for a new regulatory regime for the newspaper industry.</p> <p>Thomson, in a speech the day before she leaves the BBC after almost 37 years, drew parallels between the newspaper industry's current trust crisis as a result of the phone-hacking scandal and the corporation's own phone-in and competition problems five years ago.</p> <p>She also took a swipe at James Murdoch over his Edinburgh TV festival MacTaggart lecture in 2009, in which he said the BBC was a threat to independent journalism, arguing that profit was the only reliable guarantor of independence. \"For James Murdoch to lecture us on the ethics of journalism is a bit like taking your advice on tax affairs from Philip Green,\" Thomson said, speaking <a href=\"http://www.churchandmedia.net/Groups/188740/Church_and_Media/The_Church_and/Where_to_Stay/Where_to_Stay.aspx\" title=\"\">at the Church &amp; Media conference in Salford on Tuesday</a>.</p> <p>She argued that Leveson could look to media regulator Ofcom, which polices the broadcasting code setting out standards expected of broadcasters, as he draws up proposals on the future of press regulation to put to the government.</p> <p>\"Legislation should always be a last resort in media regulation ... But as Lord Justice Leveson reaches his conclusions it is hard to imagine he won't feel that one too many shots has been fired in the last chance saloon of voluntary press regulation,\" she said.</p> <p>\"A similar solution to that used in broadcasting content regulation \u2013 legislative underpinning setting up an independent body to apply of codes of practice drawn up by the industry, with politicians then kept completely out of the picture, is probably the right course of action.\"</p> <p>Thomson lost out to George Entwistle for the BBC director general job and will leave the corporation on Wednesday. Her post was made redundant as a result of a restructure announced by Entwistle last week \u2013 his first in the new job \u2013 and Thomson is thought to be considering job offers from outside broadcasting.</p> <p>She also looked to the BBC's future and gave an idea of her vision for the corporation had she become director general, saying that as the BBC changes \"it must never lose sight of its purpose\".</p> <p>\"It is always when the BBC loses sight of what it is here for that it runs into trouble with licence fee payers. Confidence doesn't mean arrogance. Indeed, if we are in a biblical frame of mind, humility is in order,\" Thomson said.</p> <p>She added that the guiding word for the corporation, alongside the Reithian mission to \"inform, educate and entertain\", should be the Latin motto carved on a wooden crest in the council chamber at Broadcasting House: \"quaecunque\", meaning whatsoever.</p> <p>Thomson said the word was used briefly by the BBC in the 1930s. \"The quotation is taken from St Paul's Epistle to the Philippians: 'Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are of good report: if there be any virtue and if there be any praise, think on these things,'\" she added.</p> <p>\"Just as the Reithian trilogy is still the best quick summary of what the BBC is about, so I think quaecunque is an excellent guiding word for the BBC in the digital age.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>It appears to be a suicide: the victim is slumped on a kitchen table, dishes unwashed, empty spirit glass, gun on the floor. But why? What pushed this poor squirrel to such desperate lengths?</p> <p>Visitors to the <a href=\"http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/\" title=\"\">Whitechapel Gallery</a> in London can speculate for themselves \u2013 nut-rationing? Tired of being chased by toddlers? \u2013 as the work and others by the art world's master joker Maurizio Cattelan go on display for 10 weeks.</p> <p>The artwork is owned by Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, who began collecting Cattelan's work in the early 1990s. In 1996, visiting London, she fell in love with, and bought, the dead squirrel. \"It is full of nostalgia and at the same time, energy and is very representative of Maurizio,\" she said.</p> <p>\"He is an artist who is always able to talk about things without saying this is how it is, he gives us the opportunity, the possibility to think and talk about important political and social things. It is not just art to decorate walls.\"</p> <p>The dead squirrel raises all sorts of discussions. Is it a meditation on social mobility? The work is called Bidibidobidiboo, the Fairy Godmother's spell to transform Cinderella \u2013 but no one was ever going to transform this squirrel, living in such dingy surroundings with little hope of escape to a better life. It was, in every sense of the word, stuffed.</p> <p>Or is it a much more personal piece? The kitchen is modelled on the one Cattelan grew up in and the artist has talked about how his mother accidentally left a hot iron on the yellow Formica table. To save it, his father sawed off the end with the burn mark leaving the family to always eat their meals on an absurdly shrunken table.</p> <p>The squirrel is a key work in the collection and one of eight Cattelan works on display at the Whitechapel, many not seen in the UK for more than 20 years. They travel to London as the gallery continues its project to show works from collections that are rarely seen by the public in the UK. The works from the <a href=\"http://www.fsrr.org/home/\" title=\"\">Sandretto Re Rebaudengo Foundation collection</a> based in Turin follow previous displays of work from the collection of Dimitris Daskalopoulos as well as work from the British Council and Government Art Collections.</p> <p>It also represents a rare opportunity to see so many Cattelan works in the same place. There have not been that many Cattelan shows, often because he is something of a nightmare for curators.</p> <p>When the Guggenheim in New York staged a Cattelan retrospective last year, he asked that the works \u2013 almost his entire artistic output \u2013 should be strung up in the museum's central atrium, like an enormous mobile. Perhaps because it was a mid-career retrospective Cattelan then retired, aged 51.</p> <p>Cattelan has never shied from controversy and some of his best known work includes <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=2051684\" title=\"\">The Ninth Hour</a>, showing the Pope struck by a meteor, and HIM showing a suited Hitler kneeling in the pleading position.</p> <p>The works in the Whitechapel display demonstrate Cattelan's political edge beyond the humour, such as a piece called Lullaby, which is a bag of rubble taken from the Contemporary Art Pavilion in Milan after it was damaged in a Mafia-related bomb attack in 1993. Next to it is a red neon Christmas greeting with the logo of the Red Brigades as a kind of star of Bethlehem.</p> <p>The Cattelans will be on display until 2 December after which there will be a further three displays from the Sandretto Re Rebaudengo Collection at the Whitechapel.</p>",
  "<p>Already <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/24/anti-badger-culling-petition-signatures\" title=\"\">distraught at the notion of the badgers being culled</a> en masse because of their perceived role in spreading bovine tuberculosis, the nation is now gagging at the suggestion, from celebrity chef Clarissa Dickson Wright that the innocent, stripy-faced animals should be cooked. And eaten. (Small surprise: the former \"Fat Lady\" has a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clarissas-England-Through-English-Counties/dp/1444729098/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348582211&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">new book</a> to promote.)</p> <p>Since 1992 it has been illegal to kill badgers in Britain \u2013 so the only way to get hold of one to eat has been by picking one off the road. But if the government's full culling programme goes ahead thousands of badgers could be shot this winter. Meat is getting more expensive after the global grain prices spike of this summer. Wild meats like venison, rabbit, pigeon and, yes, badger and hedgehog, are looking rather tastier.</p> <p>Arthur Boyt thinks Dickson Wright is talking good gastronomic sense. He has been eating badger most of his life: he stewed up a piece of back meat with the animal's genitals for supper last Thursday. \"Dog, especially labrador, is my favourite, but badger makes a pretty good meal.\" Boyt, a 73-year-old former civil servant and scientist, does not kill animals. All his free meat comes from the roads around his home on Bodmin Moor.</p> <p>\"I'm against the cull,\" he said, \"but it would be ridiculous not to use the dead badgers. I've eaten badger for 55 years and I certainly haven't got TB. As with all meat you just make sure you cook it long and hot enough to kill any bugs.\"</p> <p>A badger will make a meal for two, says Boyt, though his wife Sue is a vegetarian. So he often shares the animal with his son and daughter-in-law, who comes from Papua and is used to eating \"maggots and grubs.\" Boyt's favourite part of the animal is the head: \"There's five tastes and textures in there, including the tongue, the eyeballs, the muscle \u2026 The salivary glands taste quite different. And of course, the brain. You get that by putting a teaspoon in the hole in the back and rooting around.\"</p> <p>To a modern cook, eating badger might sound like a terrible idea, but people who grew up in rural Britain during the second world war remember eating it and there are historic recipes for it from across Europe.</p> <p>Badger doesn't appear in any of the great 18th century British cookbooks, and though Dickson Wright says the animal has always been a staple, it seems to have been a food only for the poor. But in France <a href=\"http://www.gastronomydomine.com/?p=184\" title=\"\"><em>blaireau au sang</em> (badger with blood) is a well-remembered recipe</a>. In Italy and the Balkans rural people have a culture of badger-eating. In Russia badgers have been a food and a folk-medicine, their fat a cure for coughs. The Prussians even bred a dog \u2013 the dachshund (badger hound) \u2013 to hound the poor beasts out of their setts.</p> <p>There are tales of West Country pubs serving badger ham as a bar snack (although these might be classed with the stories of fermenting the scrumpy with a dead rat). Boyt's usual recipe is simpler. He skins and joints the badger, saves the offal and then makes a traditional casserole, adding whatever vegetables are in the house. No wine, though he may drink a glass with the meal. \"I'm a down-to-earth chap \u2013 I like simplicity. It's nice meat \u2013 why titillate it?\"</p> <p>European recipes for badger often ask you to lay it in running water for several days to get rid of a rank flavour. But Boyt says that's only necessary for fox. And badger, though it doesn't need to be hung, can be eaten when it's \"quite green\" - that's assuming the diners aren't similarly tinged.</p>",

  "<p>\"Yes, I thought I'd drop that in. She told me.\"</p> <p>The remark by Frank Gardner, the BBC's security correspondent on Radio 4's Today programme this morning may tell you more about him than the Queen.</p> <p>Most journalists like to brag about the privileged circles they move in, though not their individual sources. Gardner mischievously added some spice even though the Queen may not be amused.</p> <p>\"Actually I can tell you,\" he told James Naughtie, \"that the Queen was pretty upset that there was no way to arrest him [Abu Hamza]. She couldn't understand \u2013 surely there had been some law that he had broken?\"</p> <p>It is not at all surprising the Queen was puzzled about why Hamza had not been arrested and put on trial years before he was convicted and sentenced for seven years in 2006 for soliciting murder and racial hatred. Many people were asking the same question.</p> <p>Moreover, the Queen receives all intelligence reports sent to her senior ministers - reports signed by C, the chief of the MI6, in green ink are sent to whichever palace or castle she is staying in. She is said to be an avid reader of the reports.</p> <p>David Davis, shadow home secretary at the time, said after the conviction: \"It would appear the only reason Hamza was actually prosecuted was because the US was seeking his extradition. No 10's claims that adequate laws are not available to prosecute is nonsense - six of Hamza's convictions were under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, three of his convictions were under the 1986 Public Order Act and only the least important charge was under the 2000 Terror Act - which in any case would have allowed for prosecution in 2001, rather than 2005.\"</p> <p>An MI5 undercover agent and a close Hamza associate told the Guardian that the preacher, who was first arrested in 1999, was an \"unwitting\" informant for the security services.</p> <p>Abu Qatada is another radical Islamist cleric who has escaped trial for many years though he will never be prosecuted here (he is detained, awaiting deportation to his native Jordan). Qatada was detained in 2003, 10 years after coming to Britain after spending 10 months apparently on the run.</p> <p>Qatada offered to act as an informant for MI5. He had a number of meetings with an MI5 officer in which he claimed he could persuade extremists not to commit terrorist acts in Britain. In one report, the MI5 officer noted: \"He [Qatada] claimed to wield powerful, spiritual influence over the Algerian community in London and was confident that he could use this influence to prevent any terrorist repercussions.\" In a later report, the MI5 officer noted that Qatada \"said that those over which he had influence were no risk to the country's security\".</p> <p>In less controversial remarks on the Today programme which he need not apologise for, Gardner said that MI5 was slow to respond to the threat Hamza posed. The same could be said about Qatada. I was told at the time that both men were all \"mouth and no trousers\" - ie full of bluster. </p> <p>That may have been a serious misjudgment. It may have encouraged the two men to appear as informants only to become increasingly poisonous and dangerous preachers.</p> <p>It may also help to answer the question posed by the Queen.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC has apologised to the Queen after its security correspondent recounted a private conversation in which the monarch told him she had lobbied a home secretary to secure the arrest of Abu Hamza al-Masri, the radical Islamist cleric.</p> <p>Frank Gardner said the monarch personally told him she was aghast that Abu Hamza, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/24/abu-hamza-extradition-us\" title=\"\">faces imminent extradition to the US</a>, could not be arrested during the period when he regularly aired vehemently anti-British views as imam of Finsbury Park mosque in north London.</p> <p>The Queen never expresses overtly political views herself, and the convention for people conversing with her, for example at palace receptions or other meetings, is that whatever is said remains off the record.</p> <p>During <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/976334-queen-upset-hamza-could-not-be-arrested?utm_campaign=detailpage&amp;utm_content=retweet&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=\" title=\"\">an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme</a> about the wider issue of the 54-year-old's newly approved extradition to the US, Gardner said of Abu Hamza's former activities that there was a sense MI5 had been too slow to realise how dangerous he was in radicalising other people.</p> <p>Gardner continued: \"Actually, I can tell you that the Queen was pretty upset that there was no way to arrest him. She couldn't understand \u2013 surely there had been some law that he had broken? In the end, sure enough, there was. He was eventually convicted and sentenced for seven years for soliciting murder and racial hatred.\"</p> <p>A clearly surprised James Naughtie, interviewing Gardner, described this revelation as \"a corker\". Gardner said: \"Yes, I thought I'd drop that in. She told me.\"</p> <p>Gardner said: \"She spoke to the home secretary at the time and said, surely this man must have broken some laws. Why is he still at large? He was conducting these radical activities and he called Britain a toilet. He was incredibly anti-British and yet he was sucking up money from this country for a long time. He was a huge embarrassment to Muslims, who condemned him.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19716941\" title=\"\">BBC reported</a> that the corporation had written to Buckingham Palace to express their regret and that the conversation should have stayed private. Gardner's comments were \"wholly inappropriate\", the letter said, adding that the BBC correspondent was personally very sorry.</p> <p>A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said she had no comment on Gardner's interview.</p> <p>Gardner did not specify which home secretary was lobbied, but it appears most likely to be David Blunkett, who held the post from 2001 to 2004, at the peak of Abu Hamza's infamy before he was arrested. Following his initial arrest in August 2004, Abu Hamza was convicted in 2006 of 11 charges connected to soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred.</p> <p>Blunkett, who is in the United States, said: \"I can categorically state that the Queen never raised the issue of Abu Hamza with me. Not surprisingly because my views and attitude in relation to this individual were very well known.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Blunkett said that when he was at the Department for Work and Pensions from May to June 2005 he \"stamped on Abu Hamza being entitled to benefits\".</p> <p>A spokesman for the republican pressure group Republic said the comments, if true, showed the monarch had needlessly \"waded into the debate\". He said: \"It is up to parliament and the courts to deal with these complex issues, not the Queen. Monarchists argue the Queen always remains above politics. Clearly that is not the case.\"</p> <p>The government has battled for eight years to secure Hamza's extradition to the US, where he is wanted in connection with alleged plans to establish a terrorist training camp in Oregon, as well as claims he provided material support to the Taliban. He is also wanted in connection with allegations that he was involved in hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998.</p> <p>Abu Hamza's fight against extradition ended on Monday when the European court of human rights rejected his appeal, as well as those of four other terrorism suspects, and agreed an earlier ruling that their human rights would not be violated by the prospect of life sentences and solitary confinement in a US prison.</p> <h2>The Queen's political views<br></h2> <p>Gardner's first-hand account of the Queen's specific views on a politically charged subject is notable for two reasons: firstly, the idea of the monarch directly lobbying a home secretary on so specific a subject, but also the sheer rarity of hearing her opinions at all.</p> <p>Unlike Prince Charles and, to a lesser if more indiscreet extent, Prince Philip, the Queen more or less never expresses an overtly political view, barring perhaps her support for the 1982 Falklands war, in which the involvement of her own son, Prince Andrew, added a personal element.</p> <p>This is not because she is not interested in such affairs, or informed: David Cameron is now the 12th prime minister with whom she has discussed the issues of the day in weekly chats. Yet such is the perceived importance of the political neutrality of her constitutional role, and the iron-clad convention that conversations with her remain unreported, that virtually no royal opinions leak out.</p> <p>What does emerge is generally the personal: the official <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/queen-elizabeth-and-her-twelve-prime-ministers/\" title=\"\">Downing Street website, for example</a>, notes her warmer relations with some prime ministers, such as James Callaghan, than others, like Ted Heath.</p> <p>Anything more political generally emerges, at best, via second-hand sources. Last year the former partner of Denis MacShane, Europe minister in the last Labour government, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8468984/The-Queen-is-cold-on-Turkeys-bid-to-join-the-European-Union-claims-Labour-ministers-lover.html\" title=\"\">recounted the Queen saying at a Buckingham Palace drinks party</a> that she opposed Turkey's EU membership. A <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/queens-politics-revealed-1355324.html\" title=\"\">1996 book by the historian Ben Pimlott</a>, based on interviews with royal courtiers and friends, portrayed her as almost left-leaning, supposedly questioning the wisdom of the Suez intervention and Margaret Thatcher's policies towards poor people.</p>",
  "<p>Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentleman: I would like to begin today by telling you about an American named Chris Stevens.<br> </p> <p>Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley, California, the son of a lawyer and a musician. As a young man, Chris joined the Peace Corps, and taught English in Morocco. He came to love and respect the people of North Africa and the Middle East, and he would carry that commitment throughout his life. As a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria; from Saudi Arabia to Libya. He was known for walking the streets of the cities where he worked \u2013 tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking Arabic and listening with a broad smile.</p> <p>Chris went to Benghazi in the early days of the Libyan revolution, arriving on a cargo ship. As America's representative, he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent conflict, cared for the wounded, and crafted a vision for a future in which the rights of all Libyans would be respected. After the revolution, he supported the birth of a new democracy, as Libyans held elections, built new institutions, and began to move forward after decades of dictatorship.</p> <p>Chris Stevens loved his work. He took pride in the country he served, and saw dignity in the people he met. Two weeks ago, he travelled to Benghazi to review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a hospital. That's when America's compound came under attack. Along with three of his colleagues, Chris was killed in the city he helped to save. He was 52 years old.</p> <p>I tell you this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America. Like his fellow Foreign Service officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures, and was deeply invested in the international cooperation that the United Nations represents. He acted with humility, but stood up for a set of principles \u2013 a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny, and live with liberty, dignity, justice, and opportunity.</p> <p>The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan government and the Libyan people. And there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice. I also appreciate that in recent days, the leaders of other countries in the region \u2013 including Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen \u2013 have taken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities, and called for calm. So have religious authorities around the globe.</p> <p>But the attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America. They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded \u2013 the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war; and that in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens.</p> <p>If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an Embassy; or to put out statements of regret, and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of this crisis. Because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart, and the hopes we hold in common.</p> <p>Today, we must affirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by his killers. Today, we must declare that this violence and intolerance has no place among our United Nations.</p> <p>It has been less than two years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive corruption in his country, and sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Since then, the world has been captivated by the transformation that has taken place, and the United States has supported the forces of change.</p> <p>We were inspired by the Tunisian protests that toppled a dictator, because we recognized our own beliefs in the aspirations of men and women who took to the streets.</p> <p>We insisted on change in Egypt, because our support for democracy put us on the side of the people.</p> <p>We supported a transition of leadership in Yemen, because the interests of the people were not being served by a corrupt status quo.</p> <p>We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition, and with the mandate of the U.N. Security Council, because we had the ability to stop the slaughter of innocents; and because we believed that the aspirations of the people were more powerful than a tyrant.</p> <p>And as we meet here, we again declare that the regime of Bashar al-Assad must come to an end so that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop, and a new dawn can begin.</p> <p>We have taken these positions because we believe that freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture. These are not simply American values or Western values \u2013 they are universal values. And even as there will be huge challenges that come with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that ultimately government of the people, by the people and for the people is more likely to bring about the stability, prosperity, and individual opportunity that serve as a basis for peace in our world.</p> <p>So let us remember that this is a season of progress. For the first time in decades, Tunisians, Egyptians, and Libyans voted for new leaders in elections that were credible, competitive, and fair. This democratic spirit has not been restricted to the Arab World. Over the past year, we have seen peaceful transitions of power in Malawi and Senegal, and a new President in Somalia. In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and opened a closed society; a courageous dissident has been elected to Parliament; and people look forward to further reform. Around the globe, people are making their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity, and the right to determine their future.</p> <p>And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that the path to democracy does not end with the casting of a ballot. Nelson Mandela once said: \"to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.\" True democracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in jail because of what they believe, and businesses can be opened without paying a bribe. It depends on the freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble without fear; on the rule of law and due process that guarantees the rights of all people.</p> <p>In other words, true democracy \u2013 real freedom \u2013 is hard work. Those in power have to resist the temptation to crack down on dissent. In hard economic times, countries may be tempted to rally the people around perceived enemies, at home and abroad, rather than focusing on the painstaking work of reform.</p> <p>Moreover, there will always be those that reject human progress \u2013 dictators who cling to power, corrupt interests that depend upon the status quo; and extremists who fan the flames of hate and division. From Northern Ireland to South Asia; from Africa to the Americas; from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, we've witnessed convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new political order. At times, the conflicts arise along the fault lines of faith, race or tribe; and often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with the diversity and interdependence of the modern world. In every country, there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for themselves must ask how much they are willing to tolerate freedom for others.</p> <p>That is what we saw play out the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world. I have made it clear that the United States government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity. It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well \u2013 for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and religion. We are home to Muslims who worship across our country. We not only respect the freedom of religion \u2013 we have laws that protect individuals from being harmed because of how they look or what they believe. We understand why people take offense to this video because millions of our citizens are among them.</p> <p>I know there are some who ask why we don't just ban such a video. The answer is enshrined in our laws: our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech. Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offense. Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs. Moreover, as President of our country, and Commander-in-Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day, and I will always defend their right to do so. Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views \u2013 even views that we disagree with.</p> <p>We do so not because we support hateful speech, but because our Founders understood that without such protections, the capacity of each individual to express their own views, and practice their own faith, may be threatened. We do so because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech can become a tool to silence critics, or oppress minorities. We do so because given the power of faith in our lives, and the passion that religious differences can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression, it is more speech \u2013 the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect.</p> <p>I know that not all countries in this body share this understanding of the protection of free speech. Yet in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete. The question, then, is how we respond. And on this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies mindless violence.</p> <p>There are no words that excuse the killing of innocents. There is no video that justifies an attack on an Embassy. There is no slander that provides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant in Lebanon, or destroy a school in Tunis, or cause death and destruction in Pakistan.</p> <p>More broadly, the events of the last two weeks speak to the need for all of us to address honestly the tensions between the West and an Arab World moving to democracy. Just as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the United States has not, and will not, seek to dictate the outcome of democratic transitions abroad, and we do not expect other nations to agree with us on every issue. Nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks, or the hateful speech by some individuals, represents the views of the overwhelming majority of Muslims\u2013 any more than the views of the people who produced this video represent those of Americans.</p> <p>However, I do believe that it is the obligation of all leaders, in all countries, to speak out forcefully against violence and extremism. It is time to marginalize those who \u2013 even when not resorting to violence \u2013 use hatred of America, or the West, or Israel as a central principle of politics. For that only gives cover, and sometimes makes excuses, for those who resort to violence.</p> <p>That brand of politics \u2013 one that pits East against West; South against North; Muslim against Christian, Hindu, and Jew \u2013 cannot deliver the promise of freedom. To the youth, it offers only false hope. Burning an American flag will do nothing to educate a child. Smashing apart a restaurant will not fill an empty stomach. Attacking an Embassy won't create a single job. That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must do together: educating our children and creating the opportunities they deserve; protecting human rights, and extending democracy's promise.</p> <p>Understand that America will never retreat from the world. We will bring justice to those who harm our citizens and our friends. We will stand with our allies and are willing to partner with countries to deepen ties of trade and investment; science and technology; energy and development \u2013 efforts that can spark economic growth for all of our people, and stabilize democratic change. But such efforts depend upon a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect. No government or company; no school or NGO will be confident working in a country where its people are endangered. For partnership to be effective, our citizens must be secure and our efforts must be welcomed.</p> <p>A politics based only on anger \u2013one based on dividing the world between us and them \u2013 not only sets back international cooperation, it ultimately undermines those who tolerate it. All of us have an interest in standing up to these forces. Let us remember that Muslims have suffered the most at the hands of extremism. On the same day our civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police officer was murdered in Istanbul only days before his wedding; more than ten Yemenis were killed in a car bomb in Sana'a; and several Afghan children were mourned by their parents just days after they were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul.</p> <p>The impulse towards intolerance and violence may initially be focused on the West, but over time it cannot be contained. The same impulses toward extremism are used to justify war between Sunnis and Shia, between tribes and clans. It leads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos. In less than two years, we have seen largely peaceful protests bring more change to Muslim-majority countries than a decade of violence. Extremists understand this. And because they have nothing to offer to improve the lives of people, violence is their only way to stay relevant. They do not build, they only destroy.</p> <p>It is time to leave the call of violence and the politics of division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice between the promise of the future, or the prisons of the past. We cannot afford to get it wrong. We must seize this moment. And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to embrace a better future.</p> <p>The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt \u2013 it must be claimed by those in Tahrir Square who chanted \"Muslims, Christians, we are one.\" The future must not belong to those who bully women \u2013 it must be shaped by girls who go to school, and those who stand for a world where our daughters can live their dreams just like our sons. The future must not belong to those corrupt few who steal a country's resources \u2013 it must be won by the students and entrepreneurs; workers and business owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people. Those are the men and women that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support.</p> <p>The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. Yet to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the Holocaust is denied. Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims, and Shiite pilgrims. It is time to heed the words of Gandhi: \"Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit.\" Together, we must work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences, and not defined by them. That is what America embodies, and that is the vision we will support.</p> <p>Among Israelis and Palestinians, the future must not belong to those who turn their backs on the prospect of peace. Let us leave behind those who thrive on conflict, and those who reject the right of Israel to exist. The road is hard but the destination is clear \u2013 a secure, Jewish state of Israel; and an independent, prosperous Palestine. Understanding that such a peace must come through a just agreement between the parties, America will walk alongside all who are prepared to make that journey.</p> <p>In Syria, the future must not belong to a dictator who massacres his people. If there is a cause that cries out for protest in the world today, it is a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets at apartment buildings. And we must remain engaged to assure that what began with citizens demanding their rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence.</p> <p>Together, we must stand with those Syrians who believe in a different vision \u2013 a Syria that is united and inclusive; where children don't need to fear their own government, and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed \u2013 Sunnis and Alawites; Kurds and Christians. That is what America stands for; that is the outcome that we will work for \u2013 with sanctions and consequences for those who persecute; and assistance and support for those who work for this common good. Because we believe that the Syrians who embrace this vision will have the strength and legitimacy to lead.</p> <p>In Iran, we see where the path of a violent and unaccountable ideology leads. The Iranian people have a remarkable and ancient history, and many Iranians wish to enjoy peace and prosperity alongside their neighbors. But just as it restricts the rights of its own people, the Iranian government props up a dictator in Damascus and supports terrorist groups abroad. Time and again, it has failed to take the opportunity to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful, and to meet its obligations to the United Nations.</p> <p>Let me be clear: America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so. But that time is not unlimited. We respect the right of nations to access peaceful nuclear power, but one of the purposes of the United Nations is to see that we harness that power for peace. Make no mistake: a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations, and the stability of the global economy. It risks triggering a nuclear-arms race in the region, and the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty. That is why a coalition of countries is holding the Iranian government accountable. And that is why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p> <p>We know from painful experience that the path to security and prosperity does not lie outside the boundaries of international law and respect for human rights. That is why this institution was established from the rubble of conflict; that is why liberty triumphed over tyranny in the Cold War; and that is the lesson of the last two decades as well. History shows that peace and progress come to those who make the right choices.</p> <p>Nations in every part of the world have travelled this hard path. Europe \u2013 the bloodiest battlefield of the 20th century \u2013 is united, free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa; from Turkey to South Korea; from India to Indonesia; people of different races, religions, and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the rights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities as nations. </p> <p>And it is because of the progress I've witnessed that after nearly four years as President, I am hopeful about the world we live in. The war in Iraq is over, and our troops have come home. We have begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014. Al Qaeda has been weakened and Osama bin Laden is no more. Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing our arsenals. I've seen hard choices made \u2013 from Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan \u2013 to put more power in the hands of citizens.</p> <p>At a time of economic challenge, the world has come together to broaden prosperity. Through the G-20, we have partnered with emerging countries to keep the world on the path of recovery. America has pursued a development agenda that fuels growth and breaks dependency, and worked with African leaders to help them feed their nations. New partnerships have been forged to combat corruption and promote government that is open and transparent. New commitments have been made through the Equal Futures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in politics and pursue opportunity. And later today, I will discuss our efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking.</p> <p>But what gives me the most hope is not the actions of leaders \u2013 it is the people I've seen. The American troops who have risked their lives and sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world away. The students in Jakarta and Seoul who are eager to use their knowledge to benefit humankind. The faces in a square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see democracy giving voice to their aspirations. The young people in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbai whose eyes shine with promise. These men, women and children of every race and every faith remind me that for every angry mob that gets shown on television, there are billions around the globe who share similar hopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common heartbeat to humanity.</p> <p>So much attention in our world turns to what divides us. That's what we see on the news, and that consumes our political debates. But when you strip that all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to determine their destiny; the dignity that comes with work; the comfort that comes from faith; and the justice that exists when governments serve their people \u2013 and not the other way around.</p> <p>The United States of America will always stand up for these aspirations, for our own people, and all across the world. That was our founding purpose. That is what our history shows. And that is what Chris Stevens worked for throughout his life.</p> <p>And today I promise you this \u2013 long after these killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens' legacy will live on in the lives he touched. In the tens of thousands who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the Libyans who changed their Facebook FB 0.00% photo to one of Chris; in the sign that read, simply, \"Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.\"</p> <p>They should give us hope. They should remind us that so long as we work for it justice will be done; that history is on our side; and that a rising tide of liberty will never be reversed. Thank you.</p>",
  "<p>Not voting in the age of Obama has become almost a taboo subject among African Americans. After record black voter turnout helped elect the nation's first black president in 2008, the decision not to vote is regarded by many as an affront to the ancestors who died and activists who bled to exercise this right.</p> <p>\"They are not worth the color if they don't vote. They oughta give us their color back. Their African-American credentials should be snatched if they don't vote,\" proclaimed an impassioned Representative Emanuel Cleaver (Democrat, Missouri) in his address to the 42nd annual legislative conference of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation before the <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/308294-1\">\"voting rights and new age discrimination\"</a> panel.</p> <p>The sense of community responsibility to vote is all the more palpable leading into the November presidential election \u2013 as 17 states passed voter identification laws that would place restrictions on the quarter of the black population that does not hold a form of government-issued ID. In 2012, voting rights have become a resurgent civil rights issue, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/22/michelle-obama-congressional-black-caucus-speech_n_1906631.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003\">prompting First Lady Michelle Obama to call</a> it \"the march or our time\" and \"the sit-in of our day\". While attempts to obstruct voting by African Americans attest to the community's voting power, voter suppression laws serve as painful reminder of the disenfranchisement they perpetually face, even 150 years after the Emancipation Proclamation.</p> <p>Institutional discrimination has historically driven black voter apathy, which remains an intangible, submerged fact permeating the lives of African Americans unable to see how their voice matters in America. The current challenges for black Americans \u2013 an above-average 14% unemployment rate, more than 27% living in poverty, violence and crime increasing steadily, alongside mortgage foreclosures and debt, and racialized law enforcement initiatives such as \"stop-and-frisk\" \u2013 lead some to feel the need for survival may usurp the right to vote. <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/users/josiepickens\">Writer and Ebony.com contributor Josie Pickens says</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"That apathy is more common than we'd care to admit- that feeling of powerlessness \u2026 we must also examine a political system that makes its own citizens feel unrepresented and ignored.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The poll taxes and literacy tests that discouraged the \"negro vote\" in a segregated country a century ago have mutated into the voter ID laws and recessionary pressures that deter African Americans from exercising their voting rights in an increasingly polarized political environment. Besides apathy, there is also active resistance from black Americans, who abstain from participating in a flawed political system in which they believe each party serves to oppress and not empower its citizens. Ferrari Sheppard, artist and independent journalist, expresses his reasons for not voting thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The United States [is] run by banks and global elite, presidents and other so-called elected officials are nothing more than customer service representatives, entertaining and lulling the masses to sleep. I refuse to play their game.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Disillusionment with the system finds historical resonance in the political evolution of the renowned African-American scholar, WEB Du Bois, who pivoted from advocating the vote in 1903, to abstentionism in 1956. In his essay, <a href=\"http://www.blackeconomicdevelopment.com/why-i-wont-vote-by-web-du-bois-the-nation-20-october-1956/\">\"Why I Won't Vote\"</a>, published in the Nation in 1956, Du Bois' scathing critique of corporate greed and its influence on politics, of the lack of affordable healthcare, of racial disparities, and of warmongering reads like a manifesto for modern-day popular <a href=\"http://www.officialoccupythehood.org/\">movements like Occupy the Hood</a>. </p> <p>While the abstentionist critique of voting is rooted in a tradition of black American radicalism, it remains \u2013 along with apathy \u2013 a hotly-contested topic of community discussion, as was recently evidenced by the <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1694167/lupe-fiasco-roland-martin-voting-twitter-debate.jhtml\">Twitter debate</a> between Chicago rapper Lupe Fiasco and CNN contributor Roland S Martin. Tweets variously denouncing Lupe as a \"clown\", praising this decision to abstain, and supporting his political freedom to choose, exposed a myriad of diverging opinions on how African Americans can create substantive change inside and outside of government.</p> <p>In his famous speech <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9BVEnEsn6Y&amp;feature=related\">\"The Ballot or the Bullet\"</a>, Malcolm X simultaneously encouraged blacks Americans to form a unified bloc that could serve as a swing vote and expressed skepticism that voting could bring about equality.&#xa0;That lecture, delivered nearly 50 years ago, still captures much of the complexity of the black voting landscape today.</p> <p>For many African-American non-voters, whether they are alienated into apathy or willfully abstain, the legacy of black inequity is inescapable, even in the era of an African-American president. So some still ask: we are in this country, but are we of this country?</p>",

  "<p>Why did the BBC <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/25/bbc-apologises-queen-abu-hamza\">feel it necessary to apologise to the Queen</a> for reporting the truth? </p> <p>I do not doubt she said what Frank Gardner said she said, not least because he is one of the outstanding reporters of our generation. So we can assume that he reported her remarks honestly and in context. </p> <p>Sure, he broke convention by repeating in public what the monarch said in private. So what? This was, surely, a good reason for doing so.</p> <p>Are we to go on and on believing that the woman has no views at all? Are the public to think she is a political eunuch? Must those who grace her presence for ever after go around whispering to each other the innermost secrets of the Palace while the populace live in ignorance?</p> <p>This wasn't a peep into the royal bedchamber. It was an opinion offered to a journalist, one of the BBC's most eminent correspondents who, it should be noted, suffered hideous injuries at the hands of Islamic extremists.</p> <p>How wonderful it must have been for him to know that the Queen shared his distaste for such extremism? Why not report it?</p> <p>The Queen's viewpoint can hardly be considered extraordinary. I am sure the overwhelming majority of the public - whether they like to be regarded as her \"subjects\" or not - basically agreed with her.</p> <p>Many people could not understand why it took so long for the authorities to get to grips with an Islamic cleric who was inciting hatred and who was so clearly not speaking for the bulk of Britain's (or, for that matter, the world's) Muslims.</p> <p>And the whole point of Gardner's broadcast was about that delay. Read again what he said after noting that MI5 had been slow to act. He continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Actually, I can tell you that the Queen was pretty upset that there was no way to arrest him. She couldn't understand \u2013 surely there had been some law that he had broken? In the end, sure enough, there was. He was eventually convicted and sentenced for seven years for soliciting murder and racial hatred.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In what way should Gardner or the BBC need to apologise for that? Gardner, no hothead, clearly knew what he was doing because, after James Naughtie had raised his eyebrows (well, he sounded as if he did), Gardner added: \"Yes, I thought I'd drop that in. She told me.\"</p> <p>Then he added some context by explaining that the Queen had addressed the then home secretary about the matter.</p> <p>I know the BBC operates under a royal charter. I know it has been sensitive to Palace criticism in the past - remember its silly documentary trailer in 2007?</p> <p>Even so, there was no need for the corporation to bow the knee by swiftly issuing a letter of apology in which it called Gardner's comments \"wholly inappropriate\". It was the apology itself that was wholly inappropriate.</p> <p>All sorts of people will be pleased to know what the Queen thinks. I admit to being initially disheartened at seeing the knee-jerk response from the pressure group Republic, in which it said the monarch had needlessly \"waded into the debate\". [<em>Full disclosure:</em> I am a member]</p> <p>I realise it has to make such a statement in public but my guess is that my fellow republicans are delighted at the revelation. It confirms what we have long suspected - members of the royal family have views and, given their position, are able to express them to ministers.</p> <p>For that, we should be grateful to Gardner. And, if we had them, we would surely doff our caps to him.</p>",
  "<p>The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, has issued an unusually stern denouncement of security council inaction over Syria, which he called \"a regional calamity with global ramifications\".</p> <p>\"This is a serious and growing threat to international peace and security which requires security council action,\" Ban said. \"The international community should not look the other way as violence spirals out of control.\"</p> <p>UN officials said Ban had become increasingly frustrated by the security council's deadlock over Syria and had decided to speak out in the bluntest terms.</p> <p>He also called for those responsibility for atrocities in Syria to be held accountable, noting \"there is no statute of limitations for such extreme violence\", and placing most of the blame on the Assad regime.</p> <p>At present, Russian and Chinese objections are blocking the international criminal court from launching an investigation into war crimes.</p> <p>\"Brutal human rights abuses continue to be committed, mainly by the government, but also by opposition groups. Such crimes must not go unpunished,\" he said. \"It is the duty of our generation to put an end to impunity for international crimes, in Syria and elsewhere. It is our duty to give tangible meaning to the responsibility to protect.\"</p> <p>The responsibility to protect was a principle adopted by the UN in the 1990s, stating that the international community had to intervene to protect civilian populations when their states were unwilling or unable to do so.</p> <p>Ban also had pointed words for two leaders due to speak at the same UN podium later in the week, Binyamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling on them to pull back from the brink of a new Middle East conflict, and to ratchet down their rhetoric.</p> <p>\"I \u2026 reject both the language of delegitimisation and threats of potential military action by one state against another. Any such attacks would be devastating. The shrill war talk of recent weeks has been alarming,\" Ban said. \"Leaders have a responsibility to use their voices to lower tensions instead of raising the temperature and volatility of the moment.\"</p> <p>Netanyahu has been successful in displacing the Israel-Palestinian impasse from the international agenda by repeated threats to take military action against Iran. But the secretary-general warned that his government's policies in the West Bank were stoking renewed conflict.</p> <p>\"The two-state solution is the only sustainable option. Yet the door may be closing, for good. The continued growth of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory seriously undermines efforts toward peace. We must break this dangerous impasse,\" Ban said.</p>",
  "<p>In the first nine months of the year, we have seen the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/26/cambodia-police-shoot-dead-antilogging-activist\" title=\"\">killing</a> of Cambodia's leading environmental activist, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/sep/12/journalist-safety-cambodia\" title=\"\">journalist</a> and a 14-year-old girl whose community faced eviction.

An estimated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/03/cambodian-soldiers-land-rights-prey-trolach\" title=\"\">400,000 people</a> have been affected by land disputes since 2003.</p> <p>This massive transfer of natural resources has been accomplished mostly through Cambodia's economic land concession (ELC) scheme, in which the government leases large plots of land to companies that agree to farm them. Those evicted to make way for superfarms are entitled to compensation, but rarely get it. Cambodia's land title system is in shambles, and poor farmers rarely hold deeds for their land \u2013 even if they are legally entitled to them, based on possession rights.</p> <p>Even a so-called <a href=\"http://www.earthaction.org/2012/05/success-prime-minister-hun-sen-institutes-land-concession-moratorium-in-cambodia.html\" title=\"\">moratorium</a> on new ELCs in May has <a href=\"http://www.forestcarbonasia.org/in-the-media/cambodia-hun-sen-grants-four-economic-land-concessions/\" title=\"\">failed to stem the tide</a>.

It allows the government to award ELCs that were \"agreed in principle\" prior to May. Of course, there is no public list of the ELCs \"agreed in principle\", so we simply have to take the government's word for it.</p> <p>In other words, it's business as usual \u2013 there's just a new gloss to <a href=\"http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/cambodia/documents/press_corner/20120509_eu_statement_on_economic_land_concessions_en.pdf\" title=\"\">distract</a> confused foreign donors.</p> <p>The driving force behind Cambodia's land crisis may be shortsighted greed, but its legacy could be long-term social and environmental catastrophe.

In fact, the law is often used against victims of land grabs, as in the case of the 13 women activists of the Boeung Kak lake community.

The women were released in June after <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/06/24/cambodia-request-joint-statement-concerning-boeung-kak-lake-human-rights-defenders\" title=\"\">international outcry</a>, but three months later, <a href=\"http://www.protectionline.org/Yorm-Bopha-and-Tim-Sakmony-women.html\" title=\"\">two more</a> land activists \u2013 including another Boeung Kak community leader \u2013 were arrested.</p> <p>For the average Cambodian, the only avenues that offer the prospect of success are public protest and individual action. The government is well aware of the desperation, and this fact helps explain the recent spate of arrests, killings and harassment. The authorities are increasingly using violence to keep a lid on things. If evictees don't go peacefully, private firms are willing and able to tap the resources of the state to forcefully capture land.</p> <p>The violence and arrests are symptoms of an accelerating breakdown in Cambodian society. People need outlets for complaint. They need recourse and accountability. Cambodia increasingly has neither. Pressure is building and the system is having difficulty keeping discontent bottled up.</p> <p>On Wednesday, officials will gather for a major conference in Phnom Penh between the Cambodian government and aid partners. At the last conference, in 2010, donors pledged <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/content/cambodias-donors-pledge-11-billion-for-development-95519109/165789.html\" title=\"\">$1.1bn</a> in assistance \u2013 half of Cambodia's national budget. This year presents an opportunity for donor governments to take action to ensure Cambodia addresses the root causes of this breakdown \u2013 from the culture of impunity and corruption to the lack of a proper system of land titles.</p> <p>The first step would be to call for the loophole in the ELC moratorium to be closed \u2013 before more Cambodians are marginalised and it becomes too late. Only when this is done can the country begin its long journey towards transparency and fairness in land rights.</p>",
  "<p>\"Send him to The Hague\" is the chant adopted by activists the world over when discussing their least favourite war criminal. Yet, although the international criminal court (ICC) has been around for 10 years, it's only in the last few months that building work has started on its permanent location.</p> <p>The Dutch were remarkably slow in catching on to the potential benefits of such a high profile for their sleepy seaside administrative town, even though they parade the country's historical links to the 17th Century father of international law, Hugo Grotius, with pride. Now they are full of ways to cash in on their identity as justice capital of the world.</p> <p>In the run up to the negotiations over the ICC in Rome, the Dutch went all out for the right to host the new institution. Their diplomats played a version of \"total football\" the likes of which have not been seen since Johan Cruyff captained the Dutch soccer squad in the 1970's and as a result The Hague was selected as host city without any competition.</p> <p>But even as the government celebrated, there was some anxiety that the court shouldn't end up as \"a free ride for the rest of the world at the Netherlands' expense,\" according to a senior diplomat who helped in the negotiations. Professor Willem Genugten, professor of law in Tilburg, agrees that the Dutch were concerned: \"At the beginning of the millennium it was not clear what the economic benefits would be,\" he says.</p> <p>\"The Dutch are extremely Calvinistic \u2013 making things difficult when it comes to money issues,\" says Professor Peter van Krieken of Webster University. Some of those fears have been allayed by <a href=\"http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/de-gemeente-Den-Haag/internationale-stad/vrede-en-recht/to/Feiten-en-cijfers-stad-van-Vrede-en-Recht.htm\" title=\"\">research</a> by the city authorities showing that international jobs in and around The Hague increased by 50% to 18,000 in the five years to 2010 and that those employees' spending power, along with that of their organisations, supported nearly as many jobs again.</p> <p>To maximise the potential economic benefit for Dutch companies, the government has part-funded <a href=\"http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/\" title=\"\">The Hague Institute for Global Justice </a>(HIGJ) a new legal thinktank in the city. When it <a href=\"http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/toespraken/2011/06/10/opening-of-the-hague-institute-for-global-justice.html\" title=\"\">opened</a> much was made of the links between global justice and the economic realm as two sides of the same coin. The thinktank's brief is to find practical ways to put law to use. One of its projects involves the development of an eco-economic dispute resolution mechanism. \"This is about companies in the Netherlands and elsewhere using natural resources,\" explains van Genugten, who has become HIGJ's Dean.</p> <p>From a diplomatic perspective the Netherlands expects to profit from championing justice and the ICC. The Hague's Mayor, Jozias van Aartsen, <a href=\"http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/de-gemeente-Den-Haag/college-van-B-en-W/to/Speech-by-Mayor-Jozias-van-Aartsen-at-the-reception-for-the-honorary-consuls-11-June-2012.htm\" title=\"\">likes to tells audiences</a> abroad that international justice is the \"vocation of Holland\" and that the Netherlands has a leading role to play in a supranational legal community.</p> <p>But some Dutch officials worry. Warner ten Kate, former political advisor to the UN at the Juba peace talks, describes Dutch support for international justice as \"very extreme\". \"It doesn't allow much space for other considerations to do with conflict resolution. I mean these things do tie your hands diplomatically,\" he says He cites tensions last year around the Sudanese referendum when the Dutch development minster Ben Knapen <a href=\"http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1846099/2011/01/04/Knapen-al-Bashir-kan-aan-macht-blijven.dhtml\" title=\"\">argued</a> in favour of leaving Omar al Bashir in power rather than risking \"chaos\" despite the ICC's arrest warrant against the Sudanese president for genocide. \"It was a fragile situation so that's why he said it,\" says Ten Kate. But then Knapen faced questions in parliament and the minister clarified his position, saying that he was presenting the views of colleagues in Sudan and that <a href=\"http://www.rnw.nl/nederlands/bulletin/uitspraken-knapen-over-sudan-vallen-verkeerd\" title=\"\">\"the Netherlands stood absolutely\" </a>by the demand that Bashir appear before the ICC.</p> <p>Ten Kate asks whether the government can make sensible policy choices or whether they are \"obliged to take the route of simply supporting the ICC and nothing else. It's a limitation on policy options.\"</p> <p>The Dutch are now busy putting the Netherlands more firmly on the map as \"the worldwide centre of expertise in the area of peace and justice,\" van Aartsen said recently. However, there's an awareness that the authorities can't take The Hague's identity for granted: \"maintaining that privileged position demands constant care and attention,\" says van Genugten. \"Economics is important; it leads to extra jobs and extra economic attention for The Hague\", he says. \"But also important is the immaterial, strengthening our image as the country of Grotius and peace conferences, and competing as a world city.\"</p>",
  "<p>The train clattered through the darkness. It was an old train and the carriages bucked and wheezed, struggling against the buffers that stopped them flying off into the night. The sea lay in shadows to the left; to the right was a thin strip of pale blue horizon, trees, and a mountain range that rose and fell, visible only by the sudden absence of light. On the left side now a refinery on the shore. Gas flares lit the water red and gold, gold and red. Mouse pressed his nose against the window and watched the flames dance upon the water.</p> <p>He slid open the window and lit a cigarette; it burnt down quickly in the blast of rich, warm air that swept into the carriage. When the cigarette was finished he sent it spinning out into the night, following the small red spark as it was whipped away by the wind. It was now entirely dark outside the hurtling train. He stared into the blackness, past the chubby ghost of his reflection, thinking ahead to London, the Course and Lee. He reached into his bag, drew out his battered mobile phone and sent her a text, grinning as he typed.</p> <p>He walked from Euston, dragging his suitcase behind him. It took him over an hour, but he liked walking in London at night when there were few people around. Taxis, lights extinguished, carried tired drivers home to the suburbs. A young couple walked ahead of him, elbows linked, perhaps drunk. Their bodies swayed together and apart like fronds of seaweed. The girl tripped and the boy placed a protective arm around her shoulders. Mouse hurried past them, wheezing. He made his way into the echoing darkness under the Westway and stepped carefully along the pavement that clung to the edge of the underpass.</p> <p>Little Venice dozed in the warm September night, slabs of light thrown onto the water from a handful of lit windows. A moorhen hooted somewhere out of sight. Mouse quickened his pace, his feet scuffing the stones of the towpath. Rubbish floated in the lagoon, drifting between the thin fingers of a willow tree that stirred the water absentmindedly, picking through beer cans and polystyrene cups and plastic bags. In the shadow of Trellick Tower, he stopped to smoke a cigarette, sitting on his suitcase in the long grass that bordered the path. The vegetation was thick and dry. He plucked a stalk of grass and ran the feathery end under his round chin. He needed a shave. He wanted to look good for the Course. Flicking his cigarette into the water, he grabbed the handle of his bag and continued along the canal.</p> <p>Finally, he came to the boat. It sat moored between two barges, uglier and higher than its neighbours. Gentle Ben \u2013 the name in ornate serif lettering on the stern \u2013 was an old Dawncraft Dandy, once the white weekend plaything of a pinstriped yuppie. It was now a dirty cream colour, the curtains were brown and raggy, the toilet gurgled foul smells. But the boat allowed Mouse to live in London, to exist among his friends; he loved the flap of the water against the hull at night, the dawn song of birds in Kensal Green Cemetery, the gasometers that sighed as they sank, moaned as they rose. A Jolly Roger fluttered gaily from the stern of the boat, the white skull just visible in the dim light. Mouse let himself into the cabin, turned on the generator and threw himself down on the narrow bed.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Lee Elek sat on her balcony, looking out over the lights of London. A book lay open on her lap, but it was too dark to read. The petals of the heavy-headed rose that climbed the trellis behind her had faded to grey in the dusk. Her hair was twisted into a bun and held in place with a pencil; a single blonde strand dropped down her cheek and she drew it into her mouth, feeling the sharp ends of the hairs, prodding at them with her tongue. Darwin was asleep beside her bare feet. The dachshund was dreaming: his short back legs galloped the air, his wet black nose twitched. Lee lit a cigarette. Music played on the stereo inside, quietly enough that single notes only emerged occasionally, hesitantly, wrenched from among the sounds of the city: taxis rushing up Kensington Church Street, aeroplanes queuing to land at Heathrow, shouts from the bars on the High Street. She drew smoke into her mouth and blew it out of her nose.</p> <p>She had stumbled out of the library earlier, her breaths coming in quick gasps. It was one of her moodswung days. She couldn't focus on the self-righteous saints and strung-out mystics she was supposed to be writing about. She skipped lunch and spent the afternoon walking purposeful diagonal paths across Holland Park. Darwin whipped along on his leash behind her like a crashed kite. An hour before the gates of the park closed, she sat down heavily on a bench in front of the Orangery. She took deep breaths, stilled her mind, and ran her hand through Darwin's soft brown coat. She usually knew how to drag herself up from these depths, but this time she couldn't shake the feeling of doom that smudged her vision and quickened her breath.</p> <p>She walked home along the High Street, stopping to buy herself sushi from the Japanese takeout on the corner, teriyaki beef for Darwin. Up the winding staircase to her flat under the eaves of the old Kensington house. They ate dinner together on the tiny veranda and then music and wine and cigarettes and a book and slowly the warm day faded around her. At seven thirty she watched the parakeets make their way squawking overhead, flying along the faded milky rails of vapour trails. She imagined them towing the night behind them as they arrowed westwards towards Holland Park, a dark cover attached to the feathers of their tails. She had bestowed upon the birds great symbolism, looked for them desperately if they failed to appear, straining her thin frame over the balcony rail to see around the spire of St Mary Abbots. As if they were the only thing left of hope.</p> <p>Darwin woke with a start, glanced up at Lee through long dark lashes, then stretched with a creaking yawn. With a last look out over the flickering city, Lee went inside, Darwin trotting behind her. Brushing her teeth in the small oval mirror, she thought ahead to the Course: tomorrow would be their first session as leaders. She shivered. Looking deep into the mirror, past the freckled remains of the summer that sat upon her nose, she imagined standing up on the stage the next day and fainting, falling face-first into the crowd of new members. She blinked and spat into the sink.</p> <p>A high single bed was perched beneath the skylight in Lee's small, untidy bedroom. An upright piano stood against one wall. Photograph albums were spread out on the floor, half-filled with black-and-white pictures. Books rose in rickety piles either side of the bed, several more sat face-down next to her pillow. She swept them to the ground. Lee peeled back the white duvet cover, took off her clothes and let them lie where they fell. She lifted Darwin onto the foot of the bed, slid under the duvet, and sat up very straight, her eyes wide open, watching the rise and fall of the sausage dog's sleeping body. It would all be fine once Mouse was here. She pictured his face: the darting, protuberant eyes, the chubby cheeks flushed red, the shriek of blond hair. Her phone beeped. She read the text and smiled, sank back onto her pillows and stared up at the ceiling, the mobile still gripped in her small, hot<br>hand.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Marcus Glass lay on his back looking up at his wife. Abby's eyes were tightly closed. Her bottom lip, sucked between large teeth, formed a pink question mark of concentration. Her hands were pressed to her chest, flattening white breasts. She let out a series of high-pitched moans. He never felt further from her than when they were having sex. He didn't know whether her groans were indicative of pleasure or annoyance, couldn't tell if her pinched face meant that she was lost in the moment or boiling with frustration. He placed his hands on her large thighs and she, irritated, opening her eyes for a moment, lifted them off and resumed her grinding rhythm.</p> <p>\"Don't move.\" Her voice came thick and sharp. \"Now, move a little bit. Just there. No. No, not there. Now come out and go back in again.\"</p> <p>Marcus was fairly sure that she was already pregnant. He kept a record of her periods on his calendar at work and watched for tampons in the bathroom bin. As he looked up he saw a slight heaviness around her jaw, a swelling of her nipples. But they continued to have sex as if it were a religious ritual, with the same unthinking repetition. He knew it was partly for the relief of orgasm, for those white seconds in which she could spit herself out of the world. But she didn't enjoy any of the build-up. He saw her struggling above him.</p> <p>He blamed the Course. It never used to be this bad. When they were first together it had been wonderful. Occasionally difficult but ultimately magnificent. Now it was like watching someone labouring up a hill, leaning into the wind and trudging desperately towards the top. He could see her nails digging into her chest and knew that there would be ten crescents of blood by the time they finished.</p> <p>\"That's it. You've almost got it. A bit faster. That's it.\"</p> <p>Marcus thought about death to stop himself coming. Abby insisted that she was more likely to conceive if she came and so she pushed herself towards orgasm after increasingly joyless orgasm. As Marcus began to move more quickly beneath her, as he became aware of the friction and the warmth and the first whispers of pleasure, he thought of clay-cold death. But he had to work hard to stop himself panicking. Once, he had thrown Abby backwards, staggered to the bathroom and plunged his head into a basin of cold water until the frantic beating in his chest stopped. But now, two years into their marriage, he was able to control the rush of terror.</p> <p>\"Oh, come on, Marcus. Sorry, I mean, please. Keep going. No, not that fast. Relax. Don't come just yet.\"</p> <p>He pictured his father on the tennis court. It was high summer and their shadows danced beneath them. Marcus was hitting the ball well; the heavy air hummed with the whump of his ground strokes, the quiver of the strings, the skidding of quick-stopped trainers. He sent his father running from one tramline to the other, cut drop shots skimming wickedly low over the net. The day heated up around them. As Abby's moans rose in pitch, Marcus remembered the moment he saw his father's racquet drop to the ground; the ball he was about to hit thumped into the fence at the back of the court. His father sank to his knees. Marcus leapt the net and fell to his own knees to face his father. Through the white T-shirt, translucent with sweat, Marcus could see a dark triangle forming just below his father's throat. He remembered thinking it looked like a vagina. A purple vagina creating itself beneath the damp cotton. Slowly, his father fell backwards. Marcus pressed at his chest, panted stale air into his lungs, screamed and shrieked until his mother came sprinting down from the house, wringing her hands and already sobbing. Marcus's sister arrived a few moments later, by which time it was clear that their father was dead. As his sister sat down, deflated, against the cross-hatch fence of the tennis court, Marcus watched something change in her face, something irrevocable that would colour everything that followed. He recognised it because he felt the same thing himself. He was nineteen.</p> <p>Bellowing, Abby came. Marcus, with a little exhausted sigh, followed. He felt himself grow limp quickly afterwards, suddenly lost within her. Abby scrunched her eyes shut, milking the last shudders. When it was over she seemed smaller, slightly ashamed. She rocked backwards and lay with her pelvis tilted upwards, a pillow thrust beneath her buttocks. Marcus got up and walked to the window. Outside there was nothing but dark sky and, in the distance, the black coffin of Trellick Tower. He pressed his hands on the cold glass, carefully arranging his left hand so that it covered the reflection of Abby's face. After a few minutes she turned the light off, pulled the covers up over her bare shoulders and curled her knees to her chest.</p> <p>*</p> <p>David Nightingale sat in his study, with the stillness of the rectory at night wrapped tightly around him. The high sweep of his forehead was bathed in green light from the lamp on his desk. Behind him on the wall was a wood-framed poster. Almost a decade younger in the photograph, his hair still sandy-blond then, he smiled above that year's advertising slogan: Come and Have a Deep and Meaningful. It had been a good Course as he remembered it. The first year they had expanded outside London. Now a map on the opposite wall showed hundreds of red flags dotted around the country: churches where the Course was taught. He shuffled the papers he had been working on, leaned back and stretched, looking up into the pleasing shadows of the high ceiling, the delicacy of the cornice-work. Occasionally he heard the distant howl of a police siren on the King's Road. Otherwise there was nothing but the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece and the creaking of his wife preparing for bed in the room above.</p> <p>He looked over the Course accounts. He had long stopped trying to follow the sophisticated investment vehicles that the Earl had set up. Money was funnelled through Cayman Island trusts, distributed among the various charities and not-for-profit organisations that came under the Course umbrella, managed by banker members who waived their fees and saved their best opportunities for the Course's monthly investment meetings. David whistled to himself when he saw how much had been set aside for developing the Course internationally. The US remained the primary target. He and the Earl had just returned from a trip to New York, where there was standing room only for David's speech in the ballroom of the Plaza. Eager priests had rushed to press his hands afterwards, snapping up copies of The Way of the Pilgrim and the Course DVD. It was good to be back at St Botolph's, though. This was where it all began. This was the Course's home.</p> <p>Only on the nights before the start of a new Course did he regret giving up smoking. He picked up a pencil from his desk, gripped it between his fingers, drew it to his lips and inhaled, breathing in the sweet tang of the wood, the sharpness of the lead. He realised how ridiculous this was and chuckled quietly to himself. He hadn't smoked since university. And this was the tenth year he had been leading the Course. Strange that he still felt the nerves, still worried that he would bound onto the stage in front of the young upturned faces to find that he was stuck for words, floundering in the glare of the bright lights and wide eyes. There would be new Course leaders tomorrow. He let his mind settle upon each of them in turn: Marcus, Abby, Mouse and Lee. He knew they would be anxious, perhaps unable to sleep, and he allowed their imagined nervousness to merge with his own. Lee's face dwelt the longest in his mind. She was troubled \u2013 he realised this \u2013 but the air of quiet panic that hung around her was one of the reasons she'd be so good as a Course leader. Nothing pushes people away like piety. A certain fragility of faith, if kept in check, could be comforting. He would need to watch her, though.</p> <p>Lying in bed later, he listened to his wife snoring. His arms were behind his head and he flexed his biceps in a nervous, monotonous rhythm. He was proud of his body. He had not developed the middle-aged dough of his peers; he jogged along the King's Road every morning, played tennis at the houses of wealthy Course members on Saturday afternoons. Propped on his pillow, he looked down at his wife, watched the tremor that passed along her upper lip with each exhalation. She no longer dyed her hair; mousy-grey strands fell down her face and trembled in her breath. He ran over his speech one final time, frowning and smiling as he would on the stage, pausing for a ripple of laughter, glancing down for a moment and then fixing the room with the intensity of his pale blue eyes. When he had finished, he pressed his palms together, muttered a prayer, placed a hand gently upon his wife's sleeping face and with a quiet 'Amen', he turned onto his side and fell asleep.</p>",

  "<p>Can Twitter be trusted? The number of tweets being published in lieu of hard cash seriously makes me wonder. And if one of the people you follow has suddenly started tweeting about Cracker Crisps, you should be wondering too.</p> <p>Said crisps are Special K's first foray into the savoury snacks market, and Kellogg's is using a \"Tweet shop\" in London's Soho to promote the product. The idea is customers \"pay\" for a packet by tweeting a message about the snack to their friends and followers.</p> <p>The shop is staffed by women dressed in the red synonymous with the Special K brand. Customers sample their wares in a \"try before you buy\" area and write their Twitter review. The Special K representatives then check every customer's tweet before handing over a 60p packet of crisps.</p> <p>So far the tweets have been gushingly positive. Ross Evans tweets: \"Mmmm Special K Cracker Crisps, I could eat a whole box and not that many calories #thetweetshop\". Which is fair enough, but it jars somewhat with his Twitter bio which reads: \"City, Gravy, Beer, Fun\".</p> <p>Transatlantic Blonde made me laugh by living up to the clich\u00e9: \"Thanks @KelloggsUK! Worked out that a serving of 21 of the new cracker crisps is only 3\". Three what? Stones in weight?

There is not a single negative tweet, which makes me slightly suspicious, particularly as a colleague and I have just tried the salt and vinegar flavour and agree that these are not the descriptions we would use.

  "<p>Michael Jackson remains among the most prolific generators of headlines the news cycle has got. <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5945363/have-you-heard-michael-jacksons-unreleased-abortion-jingle\" title=\"\">Add abortion</a> \u2013 another quite reliable traffic source \u2013 and the controversy creates itself. The fuss this time involves the 25-year anniversary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/22/michael-jackson-bad-reissue-unseen-video\" title=\"\">re-release of Jackson's Bad</a>, a heavily sponsored, heavily hyped affair. For comparison's sake, imagine something several tiers above Jackson's last 25-year reissue, for Thriller four years ago. The album is flush with extra material: the typical remasterings, a couple of remixes by DJs Afrojack and Nero that, depending on one's stance on contemporary stadium dance music, constitute either updates to or wanton destruction of Jackson's back catalogue, and about an album's worth of unreleased tracks.</p> <p>Among these is Song Groove, better referred to by its parenthetical Abortion Papers. Whatever those papers might be (presumably medical documentation worked differently 25 years ago) they're no good, condemning the woman in the song to sin and despair and whatever else the pro-life contingent warns against. The track is not quite as inflammatory as news outlets report \u2013 the circulated lyrics claim she's an atheist, which sounds nothing like what Jackson sings \u2013 and as Jackson family controversies go, lately and otherwise, this is comparatively trivial. It's nevertheless a surprise to hear Jackson earnestly rail against \"abortion papers, signed in your name against the word of God\". The political timing, whether in 2012 or 1987, is as questionable as the demo is rickety; one can see why it went unreleased.</p> <p>But then, must it have? The further you get into Jackson's discography, the more explicitly political his work becomes \u2013 by HIStory, police brutality, gun violence and the KKK are fair mentions \u2013 and though Jackson's religion is better documented in his biography than his lyrics, nothing in Abortion Papers is too different from his spiritual repertoire.</p> <p>Regarding abortion, Jackson would hardly have been the first to address it specifically, whether you count the earnest folk songs released during the 1970s around Roe v Wade or the less overt but far more popular work of his peers. Jackson might mention the deed by name, but his sentiment isn't all that far from Madonna's anguished \"but I've made up my mind \u2013 I'm keeping my baby\" in Papa Don't Preach, or Whitney Houston's stately talk about serendipity in Miracle, both released within a few years of Bad. Nor was Abortion Papers meant as a polemic, at least in Jackson's mind. \"I have to do it in a way so I don't offend girls who have gotten abortions or bring back guilt trips, so it has to be done carefully,\" he wrote in the song's notes, nuance corroborated by <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/09/abortion-fame-and-bad-listening-to-michael-jacksons-unreleased-demos/262242/\" title=\"\">longtimefriend Matt Forger</a>.</p> <p>Care or not, though, Jackson certainly sings Abortion Papers as a polemic, his voice addled with paranoia both general and sexual. By then, for every straightforward love song there was one in which passion was all-consuming and half-unknowable, the cause of as much anguish as pleasure. I Just Can't Stop Loving You and The Way You Make Me Feel hinted at this, an ineffable, inescapable force that, in the latter video, drove Jackson to night-time stalking (it's not played quite so sinister, though the undertones are there). By Dangerous, it's downright malignant. \"Don't try to understand me / just simply do the things I say,\" Jackson says on seething Give In To Me, and though the first half is probably just another instance of Jackson fretting about being misunderstood, it's just as easily understood as sexual terror. I Can't Let Her Get Away sounds more tense than heartbroken; She Drives Me Wild so pleased it's almost accusatory. The only consolation, though it isn't really, is that Jackson is not the only one susceptible to this lust; In the Closet begins with Princess Stephanie of Monaco panting about desire she cannot resist, contain or hide. All Jackson vetoes is the hiding.</p> <p>It's well documented that in Jackson's material, women don't always come off well. As early as the Jacksons, he'd sung about cheating accusations by \"wicked women\" in This Place Hotel. Then come the well-known examples: brazen groupie Dirty Diana and scorned and pregnant one-night stand Billie Jean, neither treated sympathetically. Then comes the violence, whether cartoonish (Thriller, in which the demons might as well be wingmen) or sexualised (Smooth Criminal, in which it's probably on purpose that Annie's <a href=\"http://www.lyrics007.com/Michael%20Jackson%20Lyrics/Smooth%20Criminal%20Lyrics.html\" title=\"\">struck down in the bedroom</a>). Not until late, minor track Blood on the Dance Floor would the gender dynamic be reversed, and even there, it's still much the same story: inevitable seduction leading to possible pregnancy to blood and revenge. And there come many, many admonishments, most tellingly in Wanna Be Startin' Somethin': \"If you can't feed your baby / then don't have your baby.\"</p> <p>Compared to this, Abortion Papers drips with kindness. It's another admonishment (\"I'd like to have my child\" doesn't come off as the woman speaking), but all the sex occurs offscreen, all the violence is cushioned by religion and any judgment is cushioned by empathy. It's still controversial, perhaps \u2013 but only if shorn of context.</p>",
  "<p>Well, EA Sports has finally done it. After years of hinting in this direction, building the options, crafting the background activities, nudging us toward an inescapable realisation, the purpose is now clear and the truth is out. Fifa 13 is an action RPG. </p> <p>You only really have to look at Ultimate Team, the game's increasingly epic mix of Pok\u00e9mon, Farmville, Final Fantasy and old-school sticker books. Building a team from virtual packs of trading cards, swapping duplicates and auctioning unwanted misfits has always been fun, but now there are seasons to compete in, manager tasks to beat, and team of the week challenges to undertake, all of which unlock goodies and allowing access to better players. It is essentially an adventure, with the team as a clan, fighting its way through a division of enemies. </p> <p>Added to this is the revised EA Sports Football Club section. Here, you'll find a catalogue page where gamers can spend the XP points they've earned in other sections of the game, buying classic kits, new goal celebrations, licensed boots, pro-player upgrades and other desirable swag. Like the structured multi-player systems in Call of Duty and Battlefield, it's all designed to tap into the sort of completist compulsions that drive role-playing games. Unlock, open up, play on. It's football as compulsion loop. It's the league of loot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396705926\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348597098773/fifa13_ps3.jpg\" alt=\"Fifa 13\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>And the analogy extends out onto the pitch. Ported over from the more showy Fifa Street, the new complete dribbling option lets you face goal and dribble along wide parallel arcs, giving you time on the ball and encouraging a deliciously thoughtful approach. </p> <p>EA Sports has effectively built a tactical battle system into a sports sim: every confrontation with a defender is a melee encounter, your weaponry a range of chipped, faked and weighted passes. It is so intricate, so subtle, and while Fifa 12 was clearly inspired by the rise of Leo Messi \u2013 the RPG hero of football \u2013 Fifa 13 has broadened the gamer's ability to really be him, to stop, assess and then deliver any killer pass.</p> <p>The increased physicality of the game is also noticeable from the outset. Hitting the B button when running in behind the player with the ball now pushes and prods at him in an aggressive and effective way. Of course, this sort of stuff has been in footie sim animation cycles since the PES glory days, but married to an increased vulnerability and a flighty ball physics model, the outcomes are pronounced and almost immediate, whether that's a halted attack or a yellow card.</p> <p>In defence, the jockey and contain controls from Fifa 12 are back, and both now integrate smoothly with the push/pull option and tackle buttons to allow chained combos of reactive moves. Specifically, contain now has more fluidity, allowing you to close off attackers, but also nip the ball away if they progress into your line. I also feel less vulnerable to short side passes because defenders can whip a leg out to stop speedy one-two manoeuvres. </p> <p>This has had an interesting consequence: whereas, for me, Fifa 12 felt very zonal, very structured, because of the implantation of tactical defending 1.0, Fifa 13 is much more seamless now that the edges have been smoothed off that system. Hence, versatile midfielders like Yaya Toure and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will come into their own, retrieving the ball from deep and scorching well into the opponent's half. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396705927\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348580985371/Fifa-13-Joe-Hart-008.jpg\" alt=\"Fifa 13 Joe Hart\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's also a greater sense of industry from AI team-mates \u2013 true, they're still not overly imaginative in their play, but at least they stay onside and wave madly for the ball, without you having to instigate a forward run yourself. It just feels more fluid, more adaptable.</p> <p>Another big change is the first-touch feature, which calculates a player's ability to receive a pass based on his skill, his position, and the speed of the ball. In short, a missile-like hoof across the pitch will no longer be magnetically attracted to the recipient's foot like an obedient satellite. Sure, the likes of Xavi and Santi Cazorla can (and do) take down speculative 50-yard balls as though cushioning a tiny baby, but other players will need to take drastic measures \u2013 like slowing down, re-positioning, or just preparing to chase the thing when it ricochets off their shins. </p> <p>Dave Rutter, the producer of Fifa, often talks about predictable unpredictability \u2013 it's a puzzling oxymoron, but what he means is that there is an authentic element of chance in every interaction; every touch is a wager placed against physics. </p> <p>I've really started to try to exploit this now, getting players close in on throw-ins and free-kicks to scoop up rebounds. It seems odd to celebrate a feature that gives participants <em>less</em> control, but for those who've always seen Fifa as a soulless automaton to Pro Evo's flighty improvisational oddball, it's a lurch in the right direction. </p> <p>I'm not sure the system is working quite as well with crosses, however. These have always been challenging to score from in Fifa, so many will feel that to add an extra burden on the receiving player is a bit much. When Rodrigo Palacio floats a beautiful curving ball into the path of Diego Milito, you don't want one of the world's most clinical strikers to uselessly chest it at the keeper, despite a seemingly well-timed jab on the finesse shot buttons. But then, of course, that could just be me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396705928\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348579855039/Fifa-13-training-008.jpg\" alt=\"Fifa 13 training\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And if it is just me, there's now a partial solution. Fifa 13 comes with a new skill games mode which offers a series of tutorial challenges based around eight key facets of every match. In the crossing task, you need to run into the correct zone then put the ball into the box to hit a series of targets, while shooting gets you to aim at specific zones within the goal mouth. </p> <p>Each skill game has four stages: bronze, silver, gold and skill challenge, and naturally they get progressively more difficult. With the lobbed pass tasks, for example, you start out having to chip the ball into a series of bins, but on reaching gold you need to hit the crossbar within eight attempts. They're fun but they're also instructional: for example, I discovered that I've been taking penalties wrongly for the last five years, which was handy. </p> <p>However, despite sailing through the free-kick challenge, set-pieces are still frustratingly obtuse in the game (and the new tactical free-kick options, which let you bluff and double bluff your chosen taker, merely plaster layers of ineffective artifice over the top). One final nice touch, though: random skill challenges come up while you're waiting for matches to load, giving you a little opportunity to tune your skills.</p> <p>As for presentation, a general overhaul of the graphics engine is noticeable, with crisper, brighter stadium detail and a few new contextual animations that takes us ever closer toward moments of photo-realism. When Joe Hart pumps his fist after a successful save, or Wayne Rooney wheels manically away from a goal, the actions are so smooth it is a joy to watch. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396705929\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348580169017/Fifa-13-Mario-008.jpg\" alt=\"Fifa 13 Mario\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The commentary, too adds to this sense that it's not only the sport that's being simulated, it's the theatre. While Andy Townsend will reflexively point out the brilliance of a penalty that dinks in off the cross bar, you also get Alan Smith pontificating on the Etihad Stadium's role in the regeneration of east Manchester. It all adds to this sense of occasion \u2013 something EA is also building on by enhancing Fifa 13's connection with the real sport. </p> <p>The match day function now downloads stats and trivia from the week's play and applies these to your player ratings and certain commentary elements. When it works, there's a little frisson of excitement and recognition \u2013 though many fans will baulk at having their simulation tied closely to capricious reality (don't worry, you can switch it off).</p> <p>Elsewhere, the career mode hasn't been dramatically overhauled, save for the addition of international roles, which give your player or manager the chance to represent their country \u2013 a neat idea that brings a different rhythm to the pro options. </p> <p>Online functionality adds a revised pro clubs seasons mode to the mix of friendlies and custom matches, providing more stability and longevity to the multi-player experience. The key thing will be how the game avoids some of the lag and glitching problems that cursed Fifa 12 in its early days, and that won't become clear until there are millions on the servers.</p> <p>And that is Fifa 13. In some ways, it's a very subtle continuation of the work EA Sports began last year \u2013 there are no dramatic additions. However, in tuning the defensive systems and the attacking AI, the development team has unlocked the potential that Fifa 12 only hinted at, creating a game that, at last, seems to invite improvisational play, a game in which your own skill as a player comes to the fore. It isn't about the way Fifa wants you to play any more, and that is an important part of confronting the phantom of PES in its glory days, the PES that \u2013 in pure gameplay terms \u2013 Fifa has struggled to beat.</p> <p>Now PES is approaching its best again, and Fifa 13 needed to be at its stylish zenith to hold on to the top spot. I think it is, and it does. Just. And I think this is because it is not really a pure simulation anymore; within its interconnecting systems of adventure, collection, unlocking and upgrading, Fifa 13 has become something else. Something far more interesting and rewarding.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox 360</strong></p>",
  "<p>Since Nick Clegg announced his plans for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jan/15/nick-clegg-john-lewis-economy\" title=\"\">\"John Lewis economy\"</a> earlier this year, the UK government has begun to seriously consider championing a new corporate model of employee ownership, one that promotes equitable distribution of wealth to employees, rather than focusing on stacking up on profits.</p> <p>While the benefits to this model are numerous, and include sales stability during recessionary periods, greater productivity and reduced staff turnover, only a few companies are aware of the structure. Currently in the UK, employee-owned businesses find it more difficult to raise capital and policy support because their approach is not as well recognised alongside other conventional structures. Staggeringly, this model accounts for only 2% of GDP, yet it is transferable to any sector and could put the economy into a sustainable recovery.</p> <p>When the control of capital belongs to a select few within an organisation, business performance can suffer. By improving understanding of employee ownership, the government could help foster a sense that there can be no ownership of anything without a measure of governance and accountability, and support a return to a stable economic climate too. The response to the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-law/employee-ownership\" title=\"\">Nuttall review of employee ownership</a> this autumn will be crucial.</p> <p>Tax credits are the carrot that has lured firms towards employee ownership in the past. But overall this seems to indicate employee ownership \u2013 in practice and in intent \u2013 is less for employee benefit and more for capital generation by the state and by enterprises. Simply giving away tax credits will be little more than a means of buying into the agenda.</p> <p>The moment you start thinking about employee ownership, thoughts turn to the stock ownership model made popular in the US because this is the simplest way to measure the distribution of possession across an enterprise. But little in this model actually helps employees to engage with the enterprise apart from being concerned about their owned shares. From this perspective, if I receive shares in my company I might as well sell them if management isn't going to listen to what I have to say. However, if I am given a realistic say in governance I will have greater association and accountability to the firm's performance.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.employeeownership.co.uk/publications/model-growth-do-employee-owned-businesses-deliver-sustainable-performance/\" title=\"\">Research by Newcastle University and Cass Business Schools</a> has looked at the distribution of shares as just one component of employee ownership, and focused on a sense of belonging and responsibility as a better interpretation of this idea. If you give stock options to everybody in the business it cannot be truly employee owned. We have shown that the potential benefits of employee-owned businesses are only significant when employees have a say in governance. These often link to stability over cycles of boom and recession, greater productivity and reduced staff turnover; yet only few companies seem to be subscribing to this model.</p> <p>When the John Lewis chairman Charlie Mayfield was last re-elected, he said he was accountable to the owners, which is an acknowledgement that his employees have a say in the performance of their stock management. He made the point as an important aspect of his successful re-election and not just as a token gesture.</p> <p>Other countries can provide a good idea of how not to introduce employee ownership. A decade ago many large state-owned Russian and eastern European enterprises were sold to their work forces without proper support to raise the involvement of employees in governance. Since then employee ownership levels in these enterprises have plummeted to about 20% or less, from a typical 50%.</p> <p>The movement towards employee ownership in China has been more cautious, and as in most other countries legislation and regulatory interventions alone have proven to be substandard. China has a slightly different story to tell, with some focused legislation and some support for employee owned enterprises (some enterprises are even extending their employee ownership to foreign workers).</p> <p>However, the scenario is not without its problems, the focus remains on employee stock ownership. Until this year Chinese stock options had applied only to senior management.</p> <p>The variants of the stock option model have proved merely a way to raise capital rather than to benefit employees or serve the purpose of equitable wealth distribution. While employee ownership has great promise for ensuring economic stability by reshaping corporate culture, the truth is that inducement is essential to benefits that businesses will see upfront, but if these benefits prove inconsequential, the need for mentoring and support mechanisms that help employees to truly engage cannot be emphasised more.</p> <p><em>Dr Pushkar Jha is a Lecturer in Strategy at Newcastle University Business School. He has worked on path-breaking research behind a new Whitehall policy initiative on employee ownership. This research has been conducted in collaboration with Prof Joseph Lampel and Prof Ajay Bhalla at Cass Business School, part of City University London. </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Reckitt said the alternative product was \"child resistant\", in part because of its packaging, which allows access one dose at a time. Suboxone tablets are sold in a bottle which contains 30 pills.</p> <p>The FDA has not ordered Reckitt to stop supplying tablets but the company said it felt compelled to act after seeing analysis from the US Poison Control Centres this month which showed that rates of \"accidental unsupervised paediatric exposure\" to suboxone was about eight times higher with tablets than with film.</p> <p>A spokesman for the company said the decision had nothing to do with the fact that Reckitt's film product was patent-protected while the group's suboxone tablets business is shortly expected to face competition from cheap, copycat generic drug suppliers.</p> <p>Reckitt investors have been closely watching suboxone sales in recent years after the drug lost its exclusive marketing rights in October 2009. The company had warned investors to expect generic competitor pills to be available at some stage.

  "<p>Another day, another conflict-inspired headline for Chelsea and former England captain John Terry, who reacted to the start of an FA hearing into his alleged use of racially abusive language towards QPR's Anton Ferdinand by sulkily retiring from the international scene. \"I feel the FA, in pursuing charges against me where I have already been cleared in a court of law, have made my position untenable,\" moaned Terry, adding that \"it breaks my heart to make this decision\".

  "<p>So Nick Clegg wants to tax the rich? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/29/lib-dems-french-style-tax-wealthy-assets?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Clegg proposes French-style tax on wealth, 7 September)</a>. That sounds good and, yes, making cuts should not be the only solution proposed as those who can afford it should certainly pay a fair share.</p> <p>But who are Britain's rich? The vanguard of this most privileged club is made up of foreigners living in Britain in order to take advantage of beneficial taxation conditions. So if Britain is going to tax these people to pay for Britain's problems where did those people \"earn\" their money?</p> <p>Here there are several significant issues: if wealthy foreigners (or Britons) are holding their billions in Britain and are avoiding paying tax in the country where that wealth was generated or indeed are failing to pay adequately for workers or for resources in the country where products are extracted, grown or manufactured, then what right does Britain have to tax that wealth?</p> <p>By allowing rich foreigners to park&#xa0;their cash in the UK, Britain is aiding and abetting tax avoidance. And if, on top of this, that money is made by damaging the environment or by exploiting cheap labour then the injustice committed is double-edged.

  "<p>Iran's government, determined to limit western influence and stave off cyber-attacks, appears to have laid the technical foundations for a national online network that would be detached from the internet and allow tighter control over the flow of information.</p> <p>The concept of a self-contained network has been discussed in Iran for almost a decade and has often met with scepticism, given the significant investment in infrastructure and security required. But Iranian officials and outside experts say that development of the network has accelerated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/01/obama-sped-up-cyberattack-iran\" title=\"\">following cyber-attacks aimed at the country's nuclear programme</a>.</p> <p>Last month the communications and information technology minister unveiled a plan to take key government agencies and military outfits offline and on to the new network by the end of September. US security researchers say they are seeing evidence of an operational network that is consistent with Iran's publicly stated plans.</p> <p>The researchers, working at the University of Pennsylvania's Centre for Global Communications Studies, say in a report that they have found functional versions of the sites of government ministries, universities and businesses on the network. They also found evidence of an already operational filtering capability.</p> <p>At the core of the network was high-end equipment made by the Chinese firm Huawei that is capable of sophisticated online surveillance of traffic. The network is already \"internally consistent and widely reachable\", concluded the report.</p> <p>William Plummer, vice president for external affairs at Huawei, said: \"Huawei has not sold equipment to the Iranian government nor does it support monitoring traffic. Huawei only sells commercial equipment built to global standards to commercial operators.\"</p> <p>The findings are likely to worry internet freedom activists and the Obama administration, which has spent tens of millions of dollars on initiatives designed to ease access to the internet in Iran and other countries with repressive governments. Officials had expressed concerns even before the release of the latest research.</p> <p>\"We have concerns from not only a human rights perspective, but about the integrity of the internet,\" David Baer, deputy assistant secretary for the US state department's bureau of democracy, human rights and labour, said. \"When countries section off parts of the web, not only do their citizens suffer, everyone does.\"</p> <p>Experts say a protected Iran-only network could help officials counter US-funded programs that allow Iranian activists to evade online surveillance. It could also help insulate Iranian computers from a covert cyber-attacks campaign that Iranian officials say the US and Israel continue to wage.</p> <p>The Iranian network is not expected to entirely replace the internet. But for ordinary Iranians it could be a well-run alternative to the internet, which in Iran is often still accessed through dial-up connections. Internet speeds are intentionally suppressed to make certain web activities, including the streaming of video, virtually impossible. Many websites, such as Facebook and YouTube, are blocked.</p> <p>Having the infrastructure for a skeleton Iran-only internet in place would give the government greater power to shut off access to the internet at times of civil unrest, such as the anti-government protests in 2009.</p> <p>\"The main reason for this project is security,\" said Moussavi Khoeini, a former Iranian reformer and parliament member now living in exile. \"They may say it's to increase internet speeds or protect against harmful content, but it's always been security.\"</p> <p>Not all experts are convinced that an Iranian network would be viable, especially given the need for access to the internet for commercial purposes and international communication.</p> <p>\"Any attempt by a country to make an intranet is doomed to failure,\" Cedric Leighton, a retired deputy director at the National Security Agency, said in an interview. But he said Iran's \"cyber-army\", a network of government-supported hackers that has attacked western targets in recent years, does stand to gain from the attempted creation of a national network. By connecting thousands of servers inside Iran, the government would \"build on their knowledge of networks and how they operate\", he said, increasing their capabilities to both launch and repel cyber-attacks.</p> <p>The US administration and internet freedom experts have expressed concern that the launch of the Iranian network could set a precedent for repressive governments. \"We don't want governments to believe that it is now legitimate to take a country offline,\" said Brett Solomon, executive director of AccessNow.org, a global digital freedom initiative. \"If we look back to the Egyptian revolution, where the regime shut down the free flow of information, you can see how this act could give rise to the creation of a new international norm.\"</p> <p><em>This story appeared in the </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from the </em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/\" title=\"\">Washington Post</a></p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 28 September 2012 to reinstate a quote from William Plummer, vice president for external affairs at Huawei, denying that the company supplied equipment to the Iranian government or supports monitoring traffic.</p>",
  "<p>A vitally important and thoroughly documented <a href=\"http://livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Stanford_NYU_LIVING_UNDER_DRONES.pdf\">new report</a> on the impact of Obama's drone campaign has just been released by researchers at NYU School of Law and Stanford University Law School. Entitled \"Living Under Drones: Death, Injury and Trauma to Civilians From US Drone Practices in Pakistan\", the report details the terrorizing effects of Obama's drone assaults as well as the numerous, highly misleading public statements from administration officials about that campaign. The study's purpose was to conduct an \"independent investigations into whether, and to what extent, drone strikes in Pakistan conformed to international law and caused harm and/or injury to civilians\". </p> <p>The report is \"based on over 130 detailed interviews with victims and witnesses of drone activity, their family members, current and former Pakistani government officials, representatives from five major Pakistani political parties, subject matter experts, lawyers, medical professionals, development and humanitarian workers, members of civil society, academics, and journalists.\" Witnesses \"provided first-hand <br>accounts of drone strikes, and provided testimony about a range of issues, including the missile strikes themselves, the strike sites, the victims' bodies, or a family member or members killed or injured in the strike\".</p> <p>Here is the powerful first three paragraphs of the report, summarizing its main findings:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396661642\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348565309742/drone1.png\" alt=\"drone report\" width=\"437\" height=\"190\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Whilte noting that it is difficult to obtain precise information on the number of civilian deaths \"because of US efforts to shield the drone program from democratic accountability\", the report nonetheless concludes: \"while civilian casualties are rarely acknowledged by the US government, there is significant evidence that US drone strikes have injured and killed civilians.\"</p> <p>But beyond body counts, there's the fact that \"US drone strike policies cause considerable and under-accounted for harm to the daily lives of ordinary civilians, beyond death and physical injury\":</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396661643\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348565677259/dronereport2.png\" alt=\"drone report\" width=\"460\" height=\"332\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In other words, the people in the areas targeted by Obama's drone campaign are being systematically terrorized. There's just no other word for it. It is a campaign of terror - highly effective terror - regardless of what noble progressive sentiments one wishes to believe reside in the heart of the leader ordering it. And that's precisely why the report, to its great credit, uses that term to describe the Obama policy: the drone campaign \"terrorizes men, women, and children\".</p> <p>Along the same lines, note that the report confirms what had already been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan\">previously documented</a>: the Obama campaign's despicable (and likely criminal) targeting of rescuers who arrive to provide aid to the victims of the original strike. Noting that even <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/04/obama_again_bombs_mourners/\">funerals of drone victims have been targeted under Obama</a>, the report documents that the US has \"made family members afraid to attend funerals\". The result of this tactic is as predictable as it is heinous:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Secondary strikes have discouraged average civilians from coming to one another's rescue, and even inhibited the provision of emergency medical assistance from humanitarian workers.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br>In the hierarchy of war crimes, deliberately targeting rescuers and funerals - so that aid workers are petrified to treat the wounded and family members are intimidated out of mourning their loved ones - ranks rather high, to put that mildly. Indeed, the US itself has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan\">long maintained</a> that such \"secondary strikes\" are a prime hallmark of some of the world's most despised terrorist groups.</p> <p>Perhaps worst of all, the report details at length that the prime excuse offered by Obama defenders for this continuous killing - it Keeps Us Safe\u2122 by killing The Terrorists\u2122 - is dubious \"at best\"; indeed, the opposite is more likely true:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396661644\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348567059074/drones3.png\" alt=\"drone report\" width=\"460\" height=\"58\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>All the way back in 2004, the Rumsfeld Pentagon commissioned a study to determine the causes of anti-US terrorism, and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/10/20/terrorism_6/\">even it concluded</a>: \"Muslims do not 'hate our freedom,' but rather, they hate our policies.\" Running around the world beating your chest, bellowing \"we're at war!\", and bombing multiple Muslim countries does not keep one safe. It manifestly does the opposite, since it ensures that even the most rational people will calculate that targeting Americans with violence in response is just and necessary to deter further aggression.</p> <p>A one-day attack on US soil eleven years ago unleashed a never-ending campaign of violence around the world from the target and its allies. Is it really a challenge to understand that continuous bombings and civilian-killing assaults over many years, in many Muslim countries, will generate the same desire for aggression and vengeance against the US?</p> <p>Time and again, those who have attempted to perpetrate attacks on US soil have cited the Muslim children and other innocent human beings extinguished by Obama's drones. Recall <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/nation/man-charged-in-times-square-plot-pleads-guilty-761251.html?printArticle=y\">the words</a> of the attempted Times Square bomber, Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad, at his sentencing hearing when the federal judge presiding over his case, Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, asked incredulously how he could possibly use violence that he knew would result in the deaths even of innocent children -- as though she were literally unaware that her own government continuously does exactly that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'Well, the drone hits in Afghanistan and Iraq, they don't see children, they don't see anybody. They kill women, children, they kill everybody. It's a war, and in war, they kill people. They're killing all Muslims' . . . .</p> <p>\"'I am part of the answer to the U.S. terrorizing the Muslim nations and the Muslim people. And, on behalf of that, I'm avenging the attack. Living in the United States, Americans only care about their own people, but they don't care about the people elsewhere in the world when they die.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The minute he was apprehended by US authorities, Shahzad, as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/21/AR2010062102468.html?hpid=moreheadlines\">reported by the Washington Post</a>, \"told agents that he was motivated by opposition to U.S. policy in the Muslim world, officials said. 'One of the first things he said was, 'How would you feel if people attacked the United States? You are attacking a sovereign Pakistan.'\"</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, the report documents the extreme levels of propaganda used by the western press to deceive their citizens into believing pure myths about the drone campaign. As I've <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/29/militants_media_propaganda/\">argued before</a>, the worst of these myths is the journalistic mimicry of the term \"militants\" to describe drone victims even when those outlets have no idea who was killed or whether that term is accurate (indeed, the term itself is almost as ill-defined as \"terrorist\"). This media practice became particularly inexcusable after the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1\">revealed in May</a> that \"Mr. Obama embraced a disputed method for counting civilian casualties that did little to box him in. It in effect <em>counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants</em>.\"</p> <p>Incredibly, even after that radical redefinition was revealed, and even after the Obama administration got <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/07/19/drones/\">caught red-handed spewing demonstrable falsehoods about the identity of drone victims</a>, US media outlets <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/02/deliberate_media_propaganda/\">continued to use the term \"militant\"</a> to describe drone victims. The new report urges that this practice stop:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396661645\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348568226731/drones4.png\" alt=\"drone report\" width=\"460\" height=\"123\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Significantly, the report says the prime culprit of these evils is what it calls the \"dramatic escalation\" of the drone campaign by the 2009 Nobel Peace laureate - escalated not just in sheer numbers (in less than four years, Obama \"has reportedly carried out more than five times\" the number ordered by Bush in eight years), but more so, the indiscriminate nature of the strikes. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/25/drone-attacks-pakistan-counterproductive-report\">Tuesday's Guardian article</a> on this report states: it \"blames the US president, Barack Obama, for the escalation of 'signature strikes' in which groups are selected merely through remote 'pattern of life' analysis.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396661646\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348572924461/reportcover.png\" alt=\"drone report cover\" width=\"220\" height=\"231\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The report is equally damning when documenting the attempts of the Obama administration to suppress information about its drone victims, and worse, to actively mislead when they deign selectively to release information. Recognizing the difficulty of determining the number of civilian deaths with exactitude - due to \"the opaqueness of the US government about its targeted killing program\" as well as the inaccessibility of the region - it nonetheless documents that \"the numbers of civilians killed are undoubtedly far higher than the few claimed by US officials.\" In other words, the administration's public statements are false: \"<em>undoubtedly</em>\" so. As the LA Times <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-drone-study-20120925,0,5793737.story\">summarizes the study's findings today</a>: \"Far more civilians have been killed by U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal areas than U.S. counter-terrorism officials have acknowledged.\"</p> <p>(The report is particularly scathing about the patent unreliability of the New America Foundation and its leading drone-and-Obama cheerleader, Peter Bergen, also of CNN, who has been <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/29/peter-bergen-s-manhunt-the-decade-long-hunt-for-osama-bin-laden.html\">amply rewarded with lucrative access</a> by the administration he dutifully defends. Echoing a <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/07/flawed-analysis-of-drone-strike-data-is-misleading-americans/259836/\">recent article by the Atlantic's Conor Friedersdorf</a> and an <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/07/17/analysis-cnn-experts-civilian-drone-death-numbers-dont-add-up/\">analysis from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, the report concludes that scrutiny of Bergen's key claims \"has since revealed omissions and inconsistencies in <br>New America Foundation's dataset, calling its widely publicized conclusions into question.\" It documents \"several other glaring omissions from New America Foundation's data\" used to depict Obama's drone campaign as far more benign than it actually is.)</p> <p>Finally, the report notes the threat to democratic accountability posed by the Obama administration's refusal to allow any transparency or judicial oversight regarding who the president orders killed: \"The opaque position of the US government on civilian casualties is also emblematic of an accountability and democratic vacuum.\" In that regard, the report - as its final paragraph - quotes the question I have often asked about this state of affairs, an answer to which I have never heard from Obama's drone defenders:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396661647\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348569617274/dronereport3.png\" alt=\"drone report\" width=\"460\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What has always made that question particularly pressing for me is that American progressives cheered loudly when a similar question was posed by Al Gore in a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/16/AR2006011600779.html\">widely celebrated 2006 speech he gave on the Washington mall</a> denouncing the Bush/Cheney assault on civil liberties: </p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"'If the president has the inherent authority to eavesdrop on American citizens without a warrant, imprison American citizens on his own declaration, kidnap and torture, then what can't he do?'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>What has always amazed me about that is that, there, Gore was merely decrying Bush's mere eavesdropping on Americans and his detention of them without judicial review. Yet here Obama is claiming the power to decide who should be <em>killed</em> without a shred of transparency, oversight, or due process - a power that is being continuously used to kill civilians, including children - and many of these <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/11/13/gop_and_tp_on_obamas_foreign_policy_successes/\">same</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_09/al_qaeda_leader_killed_in_yeme032528.php\">progressives</a> now <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/02/08/repulsive_progressive_hypocrisy/\">actually cheer</a> for that.</p> <p>Democrats spent several days at their convention two weeks ago <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/07/democrats-parade-osama-bin-laden-corpse\">wildly cheering and chanting</a> whenever President Obama's use of violence and force was heralded. They're celebrating a leader who is terrorizing several parts of the Muslim world, repeatedly killing children, targeting rescuers and mourners, and entrenching the authority to exert the most extreme powers in full secrecy and without any accountability -- all while he increases, not decreases, the likelihood of future attacks. This new Stanford/NYU report is but the latest in a long line of evidence proving all of that.</p>",
  "<p>As America's elections approach, with President Barack Obama slightly in front of his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, pollsters still rate the races for control of the presidency and the United States Senate too close to call, with the House of Representatives likely to remain in Republican hands. The differences between the candidates are considerable, and highly consequential for American economic policy and the global economy, although enactment of their programmes will depend on the makeup of Congress.</p> <p>The most important differences between the two candidates can be summarised as follows:</p> <p><strong>Spending</strong>: Obama has dramatically increased spending. He would likely continue many of his temporary programmes (as Milton Friedman once observed, \"There is nothing so permanent as a temporary government programme.\"); double down on having government pick winners and losers in green energy; expand spending on education and infrastructure; and substantially reduce defence expenditures.</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, favours limiting overall federal spending, currently 24% of GDP, to 20%, and keeping defence at 4%. He wants private markets, not government, to choose winning firms and technologies.</p> <p>Democrats oppose most non-defence spending cuts, arguing that reductions would cause the economy to contract. That case is strongest if the spending reductions are large and abrupt in a weak economy. If phased in over a multi-year period as the economy recovers, as Romney proposes, thrift would likely be expansionary. For example, federal spending relative to GDP fell by five percentage points from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s in the US, and by an even larger margin in recent decades in Canada \u2013 that is, through periods of strong economic growth.</p> <p><strong>Taxes</strong>: Obama would raise the top marginal tax rates on wages, capital gains, dividends, interest, and estates, especially on higher-income individuals and small businesses. Yet he has never proposed comprehensive reform of either the personal or corporate income tax.</p> <p>By contrast, Romney would reduce America's corporate tax rate (the highest in the OECD) to 25% and tax American multinationals on a territorial, rather than a worldwide, basis in order to increase their tax competitiveness. He would also lower personal tax rates by 20%, and make up lost revenue by limiting tax deductions and credits, particularly at the upper end, thereby raising about 18.5% of GDP, just above the historical average, at full employment. Romney's fiscal plan thus reduces deficits sufficiently to decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio. He favours a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, and hopes to balance the budget over eight years.</p> <p>Obama, by contrast, would run larger deficits \u2013 his spending increase is much larger than his tax increase \u2013 which imply large tax hikes in the future. Moreover, he would run far larger debt ratios than Romney, because the main driver of the debt is entitlement spending.</p> <p><strong>Entitlements</strong>: Obama has remained silent about reform of Medicare and social security, whose long-run deficits are several times the national debt. Vice President Joe Biden has even said that \"no changes\" to social security are to be made.</p> <p>Romney supports gradually increasing retirement ages, a premium-support model for Medicare, and shifting Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) to the states via block grants. The Obama campaign is pummelling Romney on Medicare, and the Romney campaign is hammering Obama for his refusal to negotiate or even propose a solution.</p> <p>The Obama policy would thus lead to ever-higher deficits and debt ratios well over 100% of GDP, a level that numerous studies imply would reduce US economic growth by one-third or more and might induce a sovereign debt crisis. Some observers suggest that Obama's unspoken plan is ever-growing entitlements eventually paid for by a European-style value-added tax.</p> <p><strong>Trade</strong>: Obama is the first US president in a long time who has not played a leading role on global trade liberalization. The Doha Round of global trade talks remains stalled, and Obama delayed the three bilateral free-trade agreements that awaited approval when he came into office. Romney is a proponent of free trade, but has said that he would be tougher on China's trade practices and currency policies.</p> <p><strong>Regulation</strong>: Obama wants to expand federal command-and-control regulation further (though the courts have stopped his extension of some regulatory powers). Romney vows an economically balanced approach that would reform Obama's major health-care, environmental, and financial-services regulations.</p> <p><strong>Appointments</strong>: Every US president appoints thousands of officials, many with considerable power. Romney has said that he would not reappoint Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman (likely candidates: economists Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, John Taylor, and Martin Feldstein). Other presidential appointees exert considerable influence on firms, industries, or the entire economy. For example, Obama's appointees to the obscure National Labor Relations Board tried to prevent Boeing from expanding in South Carolina, despite the state's anti-union \"right to work\" legislation.</p> <p>These policies would affect US economic growth, the budget deficit, national saving, and hence global trade and capital flows. With larger deficits under Obama than under Romney, America would need more capital from Europe, Latin America, and Asia, while higher taxes and debt would impede US growth and thus undermine these regions' exports. Obama would steer America in the direction of European social-welfare states; Romney's agenda is designed to prevent that.</p> <p>Whoever wins, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/02/imf-us-fiscal-cliff-global-economy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">a fiscal cliff looms at the end of 2012</a>. Previous legislation, if not reversed, will lead to large abrupt tax hikes and spending cuts, which the Congressional Budget Office forecasts would likely cause a recession in 2013. While a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress will address the fiscal cliff, the deep differences between Republicans and Democrats on taxes and spending remain wide and difficult to bridge.</p> <p>With uncertainty plaguing Europe's finances and China slowing, the last thing the global economy needs is a stagnant or shrinking US economy. But it will take strong leadership by the president-elect to avoid it.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012.</p>",

Run by the aptly named Key Haven Publications, the <a href=\"https://www.khpplc.co.uk/conferencedata.aspx?CID=ptp-2012\" title=\"\">\"tax planning\" conference</a> brings together accountants for the mega rich and multinational corporations to discuss, very explicitly, how to get away with paying as little tax as possible.</p> <p>Sessions at the conference promise advice on offshore tax planning and dealing with the \"threat\" of anti-avoidance legislation. But the really outrageous event on the conference itinerary was the black-tie dinner in the great hall of New College, Oxford, where the after-dinner speaker was Dave Hartnett, former head of HMRC, who has just retired after revelations that his organisation made deals with Vodafone, Goldman Sachs and many other companies, resulting in billions off their tax bills. We decided to crash the party.</p> <p>As Britain's top taxman, Hartnett's job was to make people pay their fair share. But he personally signed off on sweetheart deals with big corporations. Private Eye magazine has been doggedly reporting the tawdry details of his notorious \u00a36bn deal with Vodafone for more than two years now. Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/dec/08/goldman-sachs-whistleblower-threatened-sack\" title=\"\">Osita Mba</a>, a whistleblower from HMRC, spilt the beans on Hartnett's deal with Goldman Sachs, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/dec/09/revenue-chief-retires-goldman-sachs\" title=\"\">which let the bank off \u00a310m in tax</a> on bankers' bonuses. <a href=\"http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Uncut</a> has spent the last year or two <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nofB7gjh_Rk\" title=\"\">occupying shops</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZfFAbJK0m0\" title=\"\">crashing conferences</a> and <a href=\"http://ukuncutlegalaction.org.uk/\" title=\"\">suing the government</a> in protest at the deals. And the public accounts committee <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8968861/HMRC-chief-Dave-Hartnett-faces-pressure-to-resign-over-25-billion-tax-break-for-big-business.html\" title=\"\">made front-page news</a> when it slammed Hartnett for his lack of \"candour\" over the controversial deals. It's no surprise he eventually decided to resign.</p> <p>But, despite being criticised by parliamentary committees, anti-cuts activists, investigative journalists and his own staff, among the tax avoidance professionals at last week's conference, Hartnett is a popular man. When he stood to make his speech, just after the port was served, the reception was rapturous: he was without doubt among friends. He cracked a few bad jokes and the audience guffawed heartily.</p> <p>Hartnett has a history of dining out with the people he's supposed to be regulating. In 2010, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism revealed that he was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jun/17/hmrc-head-tax-corporate-entertainment\" title=\"\">Whitehall's most wined and dined civil servant</a>, accepting hospitality from firms including Goldman Sachs, PWC and KPMG. It's a classic case of regulatory capture: the person supposedly in charge of regulating an industry instead ends up chummy with them, sometimes even working on their behalf.</p> <p>Unfortunately, his nice evening quickly took a turn for the worst. Just a few minutes into his speech, the grand door to the hall opened and we walked in. We were dolled up in black tie, and had knocked up some Vodafone and Goldman Sachs name badges. We interrupted Hartnett's speech and presented him with the Lifetime Achievement Award for Services to Corporate Tax Avoidance, also known as the Golden Handshake. Hilariously, the audience applauded enthusiastically. The video we shot shows Hartnett looking as if he wants the ground to swallow him up. We were soon dragged from the room by a tax barrister who called us \"trespassing scum\" and \"intruders\".</p> <p>Hartnett is just one man; but he represents a problem that runs far deeper. Cosy meetings between the super rich, politicians and Whitehall mandarins are all too common. Whether it's in the restaurants near Whitehall, the lobby of parliament or the great halls of Oxford, the rich peddle far too much influence over those in positions of power. And, over port or handshakes, deals are made that can end up costing ordinary people dear. It's time for servants of the state to remember whose side they're on.</p>",
  "<p>The attempt by the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/occupy-movement-evolves-in-spain/2012/09/17/92605a86-fb66-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html\" title=\"\">Spanish \"Occupy\" movement,</a> the indignados, to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19712203\" title=\"\">surround the Congress in Madrid</a> has been compared by the secretary general of the ruling rightwing People's party (PP) to an attempted coup.</p> <p>Spanish democracy may indeed be in peril, but the danger is not in the streets. According to the Financial Times, the EU has been in secret talks with the economy minister Luis de Guindos to implement further austerity measures in advance of Spain requesting a full bailout. On Thursday the government will announce structural reforms and additional spending reductions, on top of the already huge cutbacks in health and education.</p> <p>Pre-empting the bailout conditions means the government is able to retain the illusion of sovereignty.</p> <p>In reality, Spain is on the brink of insolvency and under huge pressure to accept a rescue package. In return, the eurozone's fourth largest economy will have to surrender sovereign and financial control to the IMF, the European commission, and the European Central Bank.</p> <p>If talk of a financial coup d'etat sounds far-fetched, consider this statement from a recent Goldman Sachs report: \"The more the Spanish administration indulges domestic political interests \u2026 the more explicit conditionality is likely to be demanded.\" That's banker-speak for, \"We can do this the easy way, or the hard way.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, in his heroic denials that a bailout is even necessary, Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy increasingly resembles Saddam Hussein's information minister continuing to insist the Americans were fleeing and killing themselves by the hundreds at the city's gates, even as Baghdad was falling. Rajoy's strategy of denial has form. In June he insisted Spanish banks would not need to be bailed out, two weeks before they were. This paternalistic, old-fashioned attempt to mould public opinion in the face of reality seems to indicate that, as many local commentators have observed, the Spanish administration is operating \"as if it didn't know the internet existed\".</p> <p>Maintaining the illusion of sovereignty is important, because Rajoy does not want to go down in history as the author of Spain's humiliation. There is an infamous picture of Indonesia's President Suharto signing away economic control in 1998, as the head of the IMF looms over him, arms folded, smiling. Rajoy is desperate to avoid such a scene, all too aware that the governments of Greece, Portugal and Ireland fell after being forced to ask for bailouts that imposed further austerity on their populations.</p> <p>The PP also wants to avoid asking for a rescue package before crucial elections in Galicia and the Basque country on 21 October. But if Rajoy further delays in asking for a rescue, he could suffer the same fate as Berlusconi, removed from power last year and replaced by a an ex-Goldman Sachs technocrat after a run-in with the European Central Bank.</p> <p>The main problem for Rajoy is that what Goldman Sachs calls \"indulging domestic political interests\" the rest of us call \"democracy\".</p> <p>The government is right to fear the Spanish public's reaction to this new round of suffering mandated by the financial markets. Already many protest signs say: \"We can't take any more.\" With a 26% unemployment rate, 22% of Spanish households now live below the poverty line and a further 30% cannot \"reach the end of the month\" as they say here.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of trade unionists took to the streets of Madrid again last week. Loss of sovereignty is fuelling desire for Catalan independence with huge protests. Spanish citizen movements, like those in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and France have demanded a debt audit, to see who really owes what to whom. Opposition politician Cayo Lara is asking for any bailout conditions to be debated in parliament, while a group called Judges for Democracy are looking at whether the virtual deconstruction of the social state could be unconstitutional. And the Spanish indignados are rattling the gates of Congress today against the betrayal of political parties and the undermining of popular democracy by the troika and the markets.</p> <p>They are up against some of the most powerful forces on the planet. But they may take comfort from their counterparts in Portugal. Recently the Portuguese government announced it would raise social security contributions from 11% to 18% in a country which cannot absorb more salary cuts. In response an unprecedented 600,000 people swarmed the gates of parliament and 40 city centres across the country, shouting \"thieves!\" and \"cowards!\" and demanding the government's resignation. In response the Portuguese government has done a U-turn.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs and their ilk will find Spaniards at least as fiery in defence of their sovereignty.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 September 2012.

  "<p>Most of us go through life with a selective ear for the news we take in. We hear the good more than the bad, the flattering more than the insulting. And we update our beliefs in a way that reflects that bias.</p> <p>The effect appears in many guises. We update our self image when told we are smarter or better-looking than we thought. But if we hear we are more stupid and uglier than we supposed, we revise that image rather less. In the general population, about 80% to 90% of us behave this way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396648746\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348572218511/The-regions-of-the-brain--006.jpg\" alt=\"The regions of the brain to which TMS was administered\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The regions to which TMS was administered.

Photograph: National Academy of Sciences</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Academy of Sciences</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are pros and cons to what neuroscientists call the \"good news/bad news effect\", though by the nature of the beast, you might dismiss the negatives. In building beliefs predominantly on good news, we lean towards an optimistic view of life. We are less anxious of the likelihoods of unpleasant events: cancer, burglary, internet fraud, missing a flight, divorce.</p> <p>There is a cost to this rose-tinted view of the world though. To ignore bad news can be dangerous. It can make us overconfident, perhaps even reckless. It might leave us unprepared for a natural disaster, naive to the dangers of contracting disease, or oblivious to the warning signs of impending financial collapse.</p> <p> In a series of experiments at University College London, a team of neuroscientists has gone some way to explaining how this preference for good news arises in the brain. Through disrupting the function of a small brain region, they neutralised the bias and left people as open to bad news as they were to good.</p> <p>Cognitive neuroscientist <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychlangsci/research/CPB/people/cpb-staff/t_sharot\" title=\"UCL: Tali Sharot\">Tali Sharot</a> and others recruited 30 right-handed people aged 20 to 35 and divided them into three groups of 10. Each received a 40-second blast of <a href=\"http://www.ohba.ox.ac.uk/technologies/tms\" title=\"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\">transcranial magnetic stimulation</a> (TMS), which sends magnetic pulses into the head, to disrupt different parts of their brains. In one group, the TMS was aimed at a part called the left <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_frontal_gyrus\" title=\"Inferior frontal gyrus\">inferior frontal gyrus</a> (IFG), in another at the right IFG, and in the third, the target was a control region of the brain, where the pulses were not expected to have much effect.</p> <p>Within half an hour of the TMS session, participants sat down at a computer which flashed up 40 things nobody wants to happen in their lives, such as developing cancer, having a car stolen, or missing a flight. Each time, the participant had to estimate how likely the event was to happen to them. On typing their answer, the computer displayed the average risk for a person in a similar socioeconomic situation. Estimate your lifetime risk of cancer at one in 10? The average is closer to one in three.</p> <p>A second session followed. This time, the volunteers were given the same negative cues \u2013 cancer, robbery, missing a flight and so on \u2013 and had to estimate again the chance that each event would happen to them at some point. The scientists then analysed the answers to see how people's views shifted after they had been given accurate information.</p> <p>The results were enlightening. Those who had magnetic stimulation to the right IFG, or a control part of the brain, showed the usual good news bias: that is, they updated their beliefs more on hearing good news, such as a lower risk of cancer or Alzheimer's than they originally thought. But stimulation of the left IFG destroyed the bias. Those people were just as likely to change their views based on bad news as good.</p> <p>\"We believe the left inferior frontal gyrus is normally inhibiting other parts of the brain from learning from bad news. But by interfering with the left IFG we're releasing this inhibition,\" says Sharot, whose study appears in <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1205828109\" title=\"Selectively altering belief formation in the human brain\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>. A previous study highlighting the brain region appeared last year in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.2949\" title=\"How unrealistic optimism is maintained in the face of reality\">Nature Neuroscience</a>.</p> <p>The left IFG is unlikely to have sole responsibility for the good news bias. The neurons there are connected to many other regions of the brain, and it is hard to stop one part of the brain from functioning without affecting others. The effect more likely arises from a larger neuronal network.</p> <p><a href=\"http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/researchfellows/chambers.html\" title=\"Cardiff University: Chris Chambers\">Chris Chambers</a>, a cognitive neuroscientist at Cardiff University, said one surprise was that TMS had such a specific effect, apparently without affecting other aspects of behaviour, such as emotional arousal or attention. \"The researchers found no evidence of such effects. Among about a dozen different measures, only the tendency to update beliefs based on bad news was affected by brain stimulation. So for me, as fascinating as these results are, this makes it difficult to understand what brain function has been influenced,\" he says.</p> <p>Should we try to base our views more on bad news? Probably not. The good news bias <a href=\"http://psr.sagepub.com/content/5/1/74.abstract\" title=\"Do Moderators of the Optimistic Bias Affect Personal or Target Risk Estimates? A Review of the Literature\">tends to be less common</a> in people with depression, suggesting the optimists' view of life is good for our wellbeing and helps to motivate us. And here's where the work might be most use. To understand how the brain goes wrong, it helps first to know how it goes right.</p>",
  "<p>The Nigerian government has lost control of security and lacks a coherent strategy to counter the threat of terrorism, according to its own advisers.</p> <p>Senior political and military figures have told the Guardian of their growing pessimism over the state's ability to contain Boko Haram, the Islamist sect behind a deadly wave of bombings and kidnappings in northern Nigeria, and are bracing themselves for an escalation in attacks.</p> <p>\"We have a serious problem in Nigeria and there is no sense that the government has a real grip,\" a senior official close to the government said on condition of anonymity. \"The situation is not remotely under control. It is just a matter of time before we see more large-scale attacks that pose a significant threat to national security, and now Nigeria's economic growth is also at&#xa0;risk.\"</p> <p>Boko Haram \u2013 whose name is often translated as \"western education is sinful\" \u2013 has become increasingly sophisticated in its operations since first launching mass attacks in northern Nigeria in 2010.</p> <p>The sect first began using violence against the Nigerian government and police in 2003, and is believed to have advanced its operations in recent months by attracting funding and support from other terrorist groups such as al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and al-Shabaab.</p> <p>In 2009 Boko Haram launched a new phase of operations following the killing of its leader, Muhammad Yusuf, by police and security forces.</p> <p>Since then, a campaign of deadly church bombings has left hundreds dead, while attacks on mobile phone base stations have paralysed telecommunications in the north, causing an estimated \u00a33m worth of damage.</p> <p>The government has tried to fight back against the sect, and claims to have killed at least 35 militants earlier this week, and detained 60 others during raids in Adamawa and Yobe states in northern Nigeria \u2013 two of the areas most affected by the violence.</p> <p>But its failure to stop Boko Haram attacks has led many to question the leadership of President Goodluck Jonathan, who promised in March that security services would end the insurgency by June.</p> <p>A senior defence official, who asked not to be named, expressed concern that the government had failed to demonstrate the necessary political leadership to combat the threat posed by Boko Haram.</p> <p>\"Leadership is the problem,\" said the source. \"When we had military dictatorships in Nigeria, we did not experience this kind of weak decision-making. There is no way we can combat this threat without more decisive action. You cannot divorce what is happening from weak leadership and the failure to repair the divisions in our society.</p> <p>\"The level of poverty in the north, and the way southerners are behaving with impunity \u2013 it is not surprising that there is this level of discontent in northern Nigeria.\"</p> <p>Experts have frequently attributed the rise of Boko Haram to the growing divide between rich and poor, compounded by regionalism that has often pitched the largely Christian south against the mostly Muslim north.</p> <p>Two-thirds of Nigerians \u2013 100 million people \u2013 live below the poverty line on less than a dollar a day, according to Nigeria's national bureau of statistics, but that rate rises to around 70% in the north, compared with closer to 50% in the south. Much of the north has illiteracy rates of above 75%.</p> <p>\"These acts are a reaction against decades of neglect,\" the source close to the government said. \"There are similar factors to what we saw driving revolution in the Arab spring.</p> <p>Manir Dan Ali, editor of the Daily Trust newspaper, said: \"The Boko Haram phenomenon underlines the failure of the Nigerian state.</p> <p>\"The government has ignored the advice of its own security officials, who warned of the danger signals long ago, and worse, lacks a coherent strategy for dealing with the problem and its underlying causes of poverty, neglect and a lack of opportunities for the young.\"</p> <p>Resentment towards the Nigerian authorities has been compounded by human rights abuses, including extra-judicial killings, experts say.</p> <p>\"Male members of security forces have been going in and raiding women's quarters \u2013 terrifying the women and humiliating the men,\" said Chidi Odinkalu, chair of Nigeria's national human rights commission. \"These are minimal things that the state should be able to achieve \u2013 to train the soldiers on these sensitivities and use female soldiers. You can't fight an insurgency by alienating part of the community.\"</p> <p>The source close to the government said: \"There are middle-ranking senior officers who understand the counter-productive nature of raids and extrajudicial executions. But that understanding is not filtering down quickly enough to junior officers \u2013 they are making bad decisions and they are not adequately trained. The police are ethically broken, and the armed forces don't trust the police.</p> <p>\"If you talk to Nigerians in the north, the misbehaviour of the security forces has become a significant factor in strengthening support for Boko Haram.\"</p> <p>The military said it had addressed the problem of abuses by security services and changed its approach to operations in northern Nigeria. \"We are beginning to win the hearts and minds of the people,\" said Colonel Muhammad Yerima, director of defence information.</p> <p>\"We are closing in on the terrorists \u2013 the more we catch them and interrogate them and get information, and stop the people that are supporting them, the more we will be able to combat this threat.\"</p> <p>But the relationship between Boko Haram and officials is complex, experts say, with some in the security services assisting the sect.</p> <p>\"Some members of the security forces have been working as double agents,\" said Adunola Abiola, founder of Think Security Africa, a thinktank specialising in security issues in Africa.</p> <p>\"Improved and regular vetting of security personnel is very important for improving security management in the country generally.\"</p> <p>The Nigerian government has been under renewed pressure to combat Boko Haram since the US decided to designate three members of the sect as foreign terrorists, giving US authorities powers under US law to take action.</p> <p>Abiola said: \"This designation would in theory give various departments and agencies in the US government the power to actively pursue these men which could in theory result in a violation of Nigeria's sovereignty and possibly even territorial integrity.</p> <p>\"It was severely embarrassing for the federal government and reinforced domestic criticism that it was incapable of performing the most basic of sovereign functions.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Melanie Bryan \u2014 founder, </strong><a href=\"http://www.whynotchange.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>WhyNotChange</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Three tips on how to encourage women in social enterprise:</strong> First, highlight great examples of women social entrepreneurs to provide positive role models. Secondly, be more innovative in the ways in which we equip and support women social entrepreneurs with the knowledge, skills and practical help they need. Finally, be the kind of women that when our feet hit the floor each morning the devil says \"oh crap she's up!\"</p> <p><strong>Staying engaged with long term strategy:</strong> When you're passionate about your social purpose it can be hard to keep the same level of focus on the 'enterprise' bit of social enterprise. The temptation is to get so involved in working 'in' the business, for instance in delivering your services/products, that you stop working 'on' the business. Working 'on' the business is about planning ahead and managing. This can often lead to short term thinking and not enough focus on building a sustainable enterprise.</p> <p><strong>The background of social entrepreneurs is increasingly diverse:</strong> Whilst it's certainly true that lots of social enterprises develop from charities and the voluntary sector where there are already higher numbers of women in leadership roles, the background of social entrepreneurs is increasingly diverse. For example, they are now coming out of the public sector. This is interesting as again in the public sector there are higher numbers of women in senior roles than typically found in private sector.</p> <p><strong>Using feedback forms to measure impact:</strong> We've found customer satisfaction forms to be great within our service. They're simple for customers to complete and alongside the information that we need we include a question that asks customers to tell us how our service has helped them \u2014 the tick boxes are a list of our social aims. This has really helped us to show what we achieve. Equally importantly the completed forms led to us changing the way in which we brand and market our service.</p> <p><strong>A willingness to collaborate is key:</strong> One of the great strengths that the social enterprise community should have, and that women in particular are renowned for, is collaboration. This is where we can be innovative, build a culture of co-operation and leverage our networks to achieve our social purpose.</p> <p><strong>Self-confidence and attitudes to risk:</strong> The research shows that men and women start businesses for the same reasons. However, women state lack of confidence and family commitments as being barriers more often than men do. Research also shows that women tend not to 'think big' when it comes to growing their business. However, once past the initial couple of years female owned businesses tend to be more sustainable. Attitude to risk is definitely an issue both in terms of setting up a business and in terms of growing it.</p> <h2><strong>Andrea M Krause \u2014 founder and director, </strong><a href=\"http://www.fyse.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>FYSE</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Passion, but not passion alone:</strong> Passion should be the basis of your venture. However, passion alone doesn't sell any products, or make you win contracts or grants. Only passion paired with skills, expertise and experience will lead to success.</p> <p><strong>Women create fewer jobs than men:</strong> As part of our work we have just completed research into social entrepreneurs in China and what they achieve. Interestingly almost half of China's social enterprises are women led. However their ventures are mostly early-stage and therefore, compared to men, do not achieve the same level of profitability. On the other hand women social enterprises in our survey create on average only four jobs, while male social enterprises create 14.</p> <p><strong>The importance of gender integration:</strong> One thing is clear when we talk about supporting female social entrepreneurs: we cannot support them within a gender biased bubble. We need to connect and integrate them into existing networks and programs that include men. In the end it doesn't matter who you do business with, you need to learn to get along.</p> <p><strong>The level of female engagement in social enterprise is country specific:</strong> The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (2011) found that men are more likely to start a social venture than women, yet the ratio varies tremendously across countries. For example, women in Malaysia or Russia are more likely to start a social venture than men. For China it found the ratio to be about equal.</p> <p><strong>Impact measurement must be multi-faceted:</strong> Job creation is not the only measure for impact, but certainly one for all entrepreneurs. In terms of implementing simple <a href=\"http://www.thesroinetwork.org/\" title=\"\">SROI</a> often social enterprises do not measure their impact. Roughly 25% of the respondents in our survey have no idea whether they benefited their customers in any way. Looking at job creation, increase in turnover, number of beneficiaries etc are dimensions that have to be included in a comprehensive survey to evaluate the impact of a social entrepreneur.</p> <p><strong>Having a corporate background can be an asset:</strong> I think the benefit of having a corporate background is certain experience in structuring work, working and dealing with hierarchies, having a sense of competition and having had some professional training that most NGOs/ government sector cannot offer.</p> <h2><strong>Servane Mouazan \u2014 founder, </strong><a href=\"http://www.ogunte.com/innovation/\" title=\"\"><strong>Ogunt\u00ea</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Women have a talent for thinking long term:</strong> I think that women are probably very wired to think in a long term way and that helps to build a protective world, a world that connects and cares, and weaves resources for good and for the future.

  "<p>If you were to stumble upon this women's running group on an afternoon stroll around leafy Knole park in Sevenoaks, Kent, you would hear much banter, laughter and good-natured complaining. You would witness effort and determination to keep going (especially up the hills), great camaraderie and support and, at the end of the run, a \"mission accomplished\" glow of pride among the participants. While you might hold the view that anyone who runs on a regular basis is a little unbalanced, you would have no cause to associate these particular women with mental health issues. But all of them have had \u2013 or still have \u2013 trouble with depression, anxiety or low self-esteem.</p> <p>The group \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.upandrunninginsevenoaks.org.uk\">Up and Running</a> \u2013 was started two and a half years ago specifically to support women with mental health issues. One of its two founders, Harriet Heal, is a clinical psychologist, while co-founder Shona Campbell is a running coach with first-hand experience of depression. \"I suffered from recurring depression for many years, and had various forms of treatment and medication,\" she says.&#xa0;\"Then, 10 years ago, I learned to run and it transformed my life.\"</p> <p>The idea for the group came about when Shona and Harriet, also a runner, started to talk about exercise and depression. \"We realised we both shared the view that exercise was beneficial for mental health and we wanted to pass on the pleasure we've experienced from running to others,\" says Campbell. </p> <p>A worthwhile aim, and one to be applauded, you'd think; but although they&#xa0;received&#xa0;a little funding from&#xa0;Sevenoaks district council and NHS West Kent (which they put towards publicising the group&#xa0;and other expenses), not everyone was behind them.</p> <p>\"Some GP surgeries weren't willing to put the poster up,\" says Heal. \"They said there was no evidence that exercise worked, or contested that a women-only group was sexist.\" Meanwhile the local newspaper, the Sevenoaks Chronicle (in which Up and Running had placed an ad) reported that the poster had them \"in stitches \u2013 for the wrong reasons\", with the idea of an exercise and mutual support group for depression and anxiety sounding \"like a barrel of laughs\". While the newspaper subsequently issued a written apology, it shows how far sections of society still have to go in removing the woeful misconceptions and stigma attached to mental health issues. </p> <p>\"What people don't appreciate is that there's a big difference between being depressed and being miserable,\" Campbell tells me as we jog along, she expertly keeping the group together by leading from the back and shouting last-minute changes of direction to those getting ahead. \"These are all strong, articulate, bright, witty women, from all kinds of backgrounds. And they all have mental health problems. Depression often hits people who are very strong, driven and hard on themselves.\"</p> <p>So how much are they encouraged to talk about how they are feeling? \"We emphasise that it's a running group, not a therapy group, so there's absolutely no pressure to talk about mental health&#xa0;at all,\" says Heal. \"However, women often do choose to talk about what they are experiencing, and find it helpful.&#xa0;I think it's important that talking about problems is interwoven with discussion of other aspects of people's lives \u2013 it's a part of the whole, not some special 'other' thing, but part of ordinary life.&#xa0;That's normalising and destigmatising.\"</p> <p>Campbell often draws on her own experiences and uses personal anecdotes to get people talking and to get \"the elephant out the room\" as soon as possible when a new group begins. \"Sometimes people talk about painful things, but sometimes we just have a laugh and a gossip,\" she says. If the run I join on a sunny autumn afternoon is anything to go by, it's a far cry from the glum procession its detractors might imagine. </p> <p>Whatever the attitudes of outsiders, though, what really counts as far as Heal and Campbell are concerned is what the women themselves think. So what has the response been? \"Our impression is certainly that the majority of the women do experience at least some benefit from the group,\" says Heal. \"It seems to be the combination of exercising outdoors with the social and mutually supportive aspect of being with other people who have experienced similar problems.\"</p> <p>It's this latter factor that appealed to Rachel, a longstanding attendee. \"You aren't ever judged,\" she says. \"You can have good days or bad days \u2013 you are welcomed just the same and everyone is really supportive.\"</p> <p>Alexis, another regular, agrees. \"It's about the camaraderie and support of the group as much as the physical thing of actually running,\" she says \u2013 though she admits she's been amazed how much she's got out of the running too. \"When I first heard about the group, I thought it wouldn't work for me. I don't like doing something if I think I'm going to be the worst at it, and I was a bit dubious about it being outside. But I saw a colleague doing it and she looked really happy \u2013 so I thought I'd try it.\"</p> <p>As a running coach, Campbell says she would normally be working towards a specific distance or duration to be accomplished within a set time period. But she approaches the Up and Running group differently. \"We don't want running to be another pressure, another stick for the women to beat themselves up with,\" she explains. So while running distance gradually increases from week to week, there's no end goal that must be reached. But participants do get \"homework\" \u2013 another run between the weekly sessions.</p> <p>While there is not yet enough data to make meaningful conclusions about the long-term mental health benefits of taking part in the Up and Running course, the feedback so far shows that 90% of participants believe the group has had a positive impact on their mood and mental health \u2013 a full 100% say they would recommend it to others. On the feedback forms, one woman writes: \"I would not have started running without the help of this group, and now I have a way of stamping on the 'darker' days and keeping myself healthier physically at the same time.\" Another says: \"I feel my mood has improved as a result of the running \u2013 I feel more cheerful and positive.\" </p> <p>Such tangible payoffs certainly counter the findings of a widely reported study, <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e2758\">published earlier this year in the British Medical Journal</a>, which concluded that exercise didn't help alleviate depression. The ensuing headlines \u2013 such as \"Depressed? Exercise won't help you\" \u2013 rankled many of us who find running, zumba or knocking the living daylights out of a punchbag a helpful way of throwing off the \"concrete blanket\" that occasionally, or frequently, engulfs us \u2013 and also drew condemnation from some within the medical profession and research field. </p> <p>One of the biggest criticisms was that the study didn't actually measure the effect of exercise but the effect of advising and offering exercise. As <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/2012/06/11/exercise-doesnt-help-depression-lets-take-a-real-look-at-that-study/\">Sci Curious, a blogger for Scientific American, points out</a>, the people in the physical activity intervention did not end up exercising more than the control group, making the researchers\" conclusion questionable. </p> <p>And anyway, a month after the study was published, an updated Cochrane review assessing no less than 32 trials deemed acceptable for inclusion concluded that: \"exercise&#xa0;seems to improve&#xa0;depressive&#xa0;symptoms in people with a diagnosis of&#xa0;depression&#xa0;when compared with no treatment or control intervention\". </p> <p>\"I couldn't believe that news story saying exercise doesn't help with depression,\" says Mary, when the run is over and we are \"refuelling\" in the sports centre cafe. \"OK, I can understand perhaps if you went on your own, in horrible surroundings \u2013 but the social aspect and the mutual support is so important. And being out in beautiful surroundings is really uplifting too.\"</p> <p>\"Any study will, of necessity, look at a small number of specific measurable aspects or symptoms, and often the underlying model is very much a medical/disease model, so that outcomes are either 'ill' or 'not ill' according to a cut-off based on clinical norms,\" explains Heal. \"As far as Up and Running is concerned, some women have had an improvement in symptoms, as measured by a self-report inventory (we use the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Anxiety_and_Depression_Scale\">Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</a>), but when the change in symptoms is small or negligible that does not mean they have not experienced some important changes in wellbeing.&#xa0;These might be a boost to self-esteem, an improved sense of self-efficacy or a change in body image.</p> <p>\"There are also all the social support aspects \u2013&#xa0;sometimes the group gives people a sense that they are supporting others as well as getting something for themselves.\"</p> <p>Mary was part of the first ever Up and Running group back in February 2010. \"Six of us from that first group still meet twice a week,\" she says. \"You know that every Wednesday and Saturday, a group of people will be there waiting for you. It gives accountability.\"</p> <p>While some groups bond better than others, it is part of Up and Running's goal to get participants to continue running together after their 10-week course has finished, creating their own mini support networks. \"There are now weekly get-togethers for 'graduates' from any course to come on \u2013 to have a run, a chat, and maybe get a bit of advice or support and the chance to meet other women in the same boat as them,\" says Campbell. </p> <p>Given that depression affects one in four women in Britain at some point in their lives, I suspect that there's a lot more mileage in Up and Running. \"I feel passionately that I want to share this experience with other women in the same position that I was in,\" says Campbell. \"To help them as I have been helped, and make something positive out of my experience of this illness. Running can be a powerful positive factor in more areas of life than just the physical.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.upandrunninginsevenoaks.org.uk\">Up and Running's 10-week courses start regularly.</a> Each session costs \u00a32 and runs from Sevenoaks Leisure Centre, Kent.</p>",
  "<p>As I <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19505411\" title=\"\">begin the task of fronting the Police Federation,</a> my aim is to carry out these duties with dedication, care and thoughtful consideration of the issues that impact on the service.</p> <p>To be successful requires a team of all Federation representatives, a joint central committee and our key support staff all pulling together with a common purpose that is not deflected through division or unachievable aspirations.</p> <p>Ahead is a very difficult and complex journey for policing that will stretch and challenge the service to meet changes unprecedented in our history. The government must never forget that the office of constable sits at the forefront of British policing and that police officers are the bedrock of law and order.</p> <p>Over the coming months I want to make our voice heard with respect, credibility and coherence. I want to communicate clearly and focus on delivering a united, well-argued case that successfully promotes the true values and purpose of the Police Federation of England and Wales.</p> <p>There are many items in the policing agenda that concern me greatly, not least the issue of privatisation within the service. This is happening all too quickly, without due consideration to the repercussions of introducing private firms to policing. A thinktank approach for the future of policing is a dangerous step.</p> <p>My election as chair-elect coincides with the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/our-organisation/ministers/damian-green/\" title=\"\">appointment of Damian Green as the new policing minister</a>. I intend to open constructive dialogue as soon as possible, for the benefit of the future of policing, for our members and for the public that we serve. The government needs to start listening to the voice and experience from the frontline. We exist to protect the public and instil law and order. We are an emergency service first and foremost and should never be subject to profit and loss margins. You cannot put a price on public safety.</p> <p>The government's police cuts are still too deep and while we need to take our fair share, they are excessive and have the very real potential to see the demise of the finest service in the world. We are already seeing the harsh realities of the imposition of extreme budget cuts to the service and they are shocking.</p> <p>As a consequence, officer morale is extremely low at the moment and there is an overall feeling of betrayal and attack by this government.</p> <p>In November we will see the introduction of police and crime commissioners. It is imperative that we engage with them for the greater good of the public and the service. I have strong concerns of increasing political interference in policing, but only time will tell.</p> <p>We must not lose sight of our priority, which is to ensure that the great British police service does not continue to be eroded. We still have dedicated, warranted police officers who want to serve their public and get on with the job. Let's try and work to our strengths and leave the politics out of policing. In an ideal world, policing should be left to those who know the realities of the job.</p> <p><em>Inspector Steve Williams is chair-elect of the Police Federation of England and Wales</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A ban on shark finning and the adoption of a global shark conservation plan is being sought at a meeting of more than 50 countries in Bonn this week.</p> <p>The UK-backed draft plan to monitor and manage shark populations is under discussion at the first official meeting of signatories to a landmark memorandum of understanding on the <a href=\"http://www.cms.int/species/sharks/MOS_Mtgs/mos1_docs_overview.htm\" title=\"\">Convention of Migratory Species</a> (CMS). A decision is expected on Thursday.</p> <p>The market for shark fins, used in shark fin soup, is a major threat to shark populations, with fins <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/domes_fish/ReportsToCongress/SharkFinningReport11.pdf\" title=\"\">among the most expensive fish products in the world at $740 (\u00a3456) per kilo</a>. The high value of fins compared to the usually lower value of the rest of the shark meat creates an economic incentive for the wasteful practice of slicing off a shark's fins and discarding the body at sea. Several hotel chains in Asia, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/18/shangri-la-hotels-shark-fin-soup\" title=\"\">Shangri-La</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/24/shark-fin-peninsula-hotels\" title=\"\">Peninsula</a>, have banned shark fin soup as a result of campaigning for an end to finning.</p> <p>Shark finning has been banned by more than 60 fishing nations as well as the European Union. But in the EU and in many countries, permits for processing on board can be obtained in some cases, whereby shark fins can be removed from the carcasses and stored separately. A vote in the European parliament's committee on fisheries voted on the issue on 19 September, but failed to close the loopholes.</p> <p>Sandrine Polti, shark policy adviser to the Pew Environment Group, said: \"Pew strongly supports the European commission's proposal [made in 2011, to end the permits] and urges all parliamentarians to endorse a strict EU policy against removing shark fins at sea, without any more exceptions,\"</p> <p>The plan under discussion at this week's CMS would commit countries to: \"Where not already in place, consider enacting legislation or regulations requiring sharks to be landed with each fin naturally attached.\"</p> <p>Officials from the UK hope to strengthen the language so as to achieve a global, watertight and exception-free commitment to a ban on shark finning. The fisheries minister, Richard Benyon, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URTsFG5feJI\" title=\"\">plunged into a tank of sharks \u2013 behind a net \u2013 at the Sealife London Aquarium in August</a> to highlight the UK's opposition to shark finning.</p> <p>\u2022 Stanley Johnson's new book, Where the Wild Things Were: Travels of a Conservationist, is published by Stacey International</p>",
  "<p>The governor of the Italian region of Lazio has resigned amid a scandal over the alleged embezzlement of public funds, which were reportedly used to buy cars, holidays and expensive dinners.</p> <p>Calls for the resignation of Renata Polverini, who was backed by Silvio Berlusconi, had grown amid public anger after photos were published of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/pig-mask-party-italian-scandal\" title=\"\">a bawdy toga party</a> hosted by a member of Lazio's regional council, where men wearing pig masks fondled female guests.</p> <p>The scandal is set to reinforce voters' views of Italy's elected officials as overpaid and corrupt, increasing doubts over their ability to gain office and govern effectively next year, when Italy's technocrat government headed by Mario Monti is expected to step down.</p> <p>\"Polverini's resignation cannot reduce Italy's trust in their political parties because it is already at zero,\" said Roberto D'Alimonte, a professor of politics at LUISS university in Rome.</p> <p>\"This will also weaken Silvio Berlusconi's chances of resurrecting his Freedom People party,\" he added, \"while the Democratic party isn't coming out of this well because it failed to criticise the use of funds in Lazio, even if its regional councillors did not appear to benefit.\"</p> <p>Polverini's predecessor, Piero Marrazzo, a Democratic party candidate, had stepped down after he admitted frequenting transsexual prostitutes.</p> <p>In the latest scandal, Franco Fiorito, a former top official of Berlusconi's Freedom People party in Lazio, is being investigated on suspicion of embezzling up to \u20ac1m (\u00a3795,000) in public funds and allowing fellow officials to rack up huge expense claims. He has said Polverini was aware of the misuse of funds, although she denied that on Monday, condemning councillors as \"thieves\".</p> <p>The scandal coincides with signs Berlusconi is seeking a comeback at elections in 2013 following his resignation last November. In an <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2012/09/25/silvio-berlusconi-monti-polverini_n_1911659.html\" title=\"Huffington Post Italia interview with Berlusconi\">interview with the Huffington Post's new Italian offshoot</a> on Tuesday he denounced Germany as a \"hegemonic state\", which is he said was seeking to dictate rules on austerity to the rest of Europe.</p> <p>Berlusconi's bid to return to power could yet be thwarted by the infighting within his own party, which observers said was behind the whistleblowing at Lazio. Control of the centre-left Democratic party is also being contested by factions.</p> <p>Monti said on Monday that the parties' inability this year to push through a promised law clamping down on corruption was \"inexcusable\".</p> <p>The chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pier Carlo Padoan, said on Monday he was \"worried about the political uncertainty\" in Italy.</p> <p>D'Alimonte said the Lazio scandal could weaken Berlusconi to the extent that he throws his weight behind a coalition government next year, with Monti staying on as prime minister.</p> <p>\"But it might be harder to form that coalition if the traditional parties suffer from these scandals \u2013 and that is a scenario the markets really fear,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Fifa, it seems, has a title fight on its hands. Its closest and biggest rival, Pro Evolution Soccer, has made a shock return to form this season and if Electronic Arts's title is to remain at the head of the pixellated premier league, this is no time to be wastefully dropping points ...</p> <p>The good news for fans of the series is that Fifa 13 delivers \u2013 and in some style. Not only raising the bar for football video games once again, it is also simply one of the most comprehensive sports titles ever created.</p> <p>Noticeable from the whistle is how the game feels more like a Super Sunday Sky Sports production than any previous Fifa. Commentators will now switch to the touchline to provide details of player injuries, while Alan McInally will regularly phone in with the latest goals from other matches around the country.</p> <p>But the commentary team can also remark on real-world football events as well, via a new online update option. Thus, upon selecting Manchester United, both Martin Tyler and Alan Smith started the match by discussing Van Persie's impressive start to the season. It's certainly a nice touch but these live updates go further than just the commentary, with player statistics rising and falling depending on how they're performing in real life.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Fifa 13's career has mode has also been updated. You can now work your way up to managing \u2013 or playing for \u2013 the national team, while managers can interact with the board and even get sacked mid-season. The transfer window has also been improved, with player morale and form impacting their transfer price. It's not quite Football Manager but there's certainly a lot more depth to it than in previous iterations of the game.</p> <p>However, the most significant changes this year are in how Fifa actually performs on the field. The player physics engine returns for a second year, as does the game's superior, if slightly complicated, defence mechanics. And these are joined by a complete dribbling system, which allows players to better shield the ball or avoid a tackle. Meanwhile, the AI of teammates has also been improved, and there are more options going forward.</p> <p>But perhaps the most noticeable of these in-play upgrades is that players will no longer control the ball perfectly every time. Which is far more reflective of stark reality. Hence, while a poor pass to Lionel Messi might go unnoticed, a duff ball into Carlton Cole will likely result in him losing possession. Which might sound frustrating \u2013 and on occasions it can be \u2013 but it also adds an element of unpredictability and realism when attacking <em>and</em> defending.</p> <p>All of this glorious verisimilitude will no doubt be welcomed by many but it does come at the price of adding levels of complexity that make the game a little inaccessible for newcomers. And anyone who has not played a Fifa title for a few years might want to start by playing the new Skill Games mode first.</p> <p>These are effectively a series of bite-sized score-based challenges to help players master everything from passing to penalties. Picture Kick Flick Football on iPhone but built using the Fifa engine and that's pretty good idea of what to expect. These games can become hugely addictive and as they also appear during the pre-match loading screens (replacing the free-play shooting from previous titles), expect to occasionally deliberately delay a kick-off in a bid to set a new high score.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there's no such training mode to help work out the game's maze-like menu screens. And for those gamers that don't know their Ultimate Teams from their Live Fixtures, the process of navigating the title can be a daunting experience.</p> <p>Equally, there are also what feels like a ridiculous number of log-in screens and online services to navigate all of which begs the question as to why, with all the attention to detail elsewhere, EA could not have come up with a more unified system for all the various sections.</p> <p>Yet criticising Fifa 13 for having too many modes seems churlish at best, since it's this very depth of content that should keep gamers playing the game right up until next season's title. And that's the trick with modern football games. Fifa is a hugely impressive sports game today, arguably the best ever and may well remain as such in six months time. Live updates, huge number of play modes and deep gameplay mechanics, give it every chance to do so.</p> <p>But if, for whatever reason, all that is still not enough, there is always Pro Evo waiting to be brought on to offer new options up front. For fans of its video game form at least, this really is a golden age for football.</p>",

These talks aim to bring an end to the appalling human rights situation in Sudan. He is the leader of a major Sudanese opposition movement, the Justice and Equality Movement.</p> <p>The high court judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams described the government's approach to Fediel as \"unreasonably restrictive\" in January of this year.</p> <p>In a statement to the court Fediel accused the government of failing to provide him with protection because there was a deal between the two governments.</p> <p>\"I believe the government of Sudan is requesting the UK government to treat me like this for political reasons. Their decisions to exclude and restrict me are underpinned by political and intelligence considerations.\"</p> <p>He expressed concern about the military support and training provided by the UK: \"If it was and is the intention of the UK authorities to teach Sudan's police and security officers how to conduct these matters in a democratic manner, it has failed. The brutality and genocidal activities of government of Sudan state organs against its own citizens is widely documented.\"</p> <p>In July the Foreign Office minister Lord Howell admitted about Sudan: \"There is ample evidence that the military tactics being used raise concerns that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community may be being committed.\"</p> <p>Fediel said that as well as the UK's provision of military support to his government the UK had also been providing support and training to Sudanese police and security officials. He said that in May a group of senior police officers came to the UK for training.</p> <p>A letter from the former Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis in 2010 stated: \"The UK has a large police support programme in Democratic Republic of the Congo.\"</p> <p>Aaron Hall, the associate director of research for the Enough Project, said: \"We would hope that any nation providing military and security support to these countries would have conditions attached to that support based on the adherence to international human rights laws and standards. If credible evidence exists that shows violation of those laws and standards whether within those countries borders or externally, we would urge those governments providing support to immediately suspend that support, and further to work with international and regional partners to hold those responsible for human rights abuses accountable for their actions.\"</p> <p>Jovanka Savic, Fediel's solicitor, said: \"There is an obligation under international law that requires states to bring to an end breaches of international law through legal means. This new evidence suggests that the UK is not helping to do this but is instead giving aid and assistance to the Sudanese government in a way that could be in breach of its international legal obligations. It is very concerning that support is being offered to DRC where many human rights abuses have been documented.\"</p> <p>She said the UK's actions against Fediel, in preventing or restricting him from attending peace talks around the world, was helping to prolong the human suffering and conflict in Sudan.</p> <p>\"They are making this man's life very difficult for political and arguably illegal reasons,\" she said.</p> <p>The government provided a response from four departments \u2013 the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Strict criteria are applied to any training to ensure that it complies with overseas security and assistance human rights guidance. For each funding decision an assessment of the risk of human rights abuses is carried out. Her Majesty's government conducts continual assessment of its programmes and human rights compliance is a cardinal criterion of this.</p> <p>\"UK officials have contact with international criminal court indictees only when this is considered essential and on a case-by-case basis. No contact with President Bashir has come about as a result of these programmes.\"</p> <p>However, the spokesman confirmed that some meetings had taken place between the previous and present ambassador to Sudan and Bashir. \"The main occasions are when a British ambassador leaves or takes up their post in Khartoum.\"</p> <p>The spokesman said that international peace support was delivered to UN peacekeeping missions in Sudan and South Sudan and funding was provided for the African Union panel leading the talks aimed at ending the conflict.</p> <p>He confirmed that nine senior national police officers from Sudan visited London in May to learn about policing and human rights in the UK, two of whom held the rank of major general. \"The officers met the Sudanese ambassador at his London office as a protocol courtesy.\" He said that community policing initiatives had been set up following the officers' return to Sudan.</p> <h2>The reaction from Africa </h2> <p>Studies have shown that Congolese soldiers are responsible for at least 60% of reported rapes in the country. Last year the UN implicated them in the rape of at least 121 women over three days in the village of Nyakiele, in South Kivu province. This came after the gang-rape of at least 47 women by government troops in North Kivu.</p> <p>The UN's high commissioner for human rights has said: \"The Congolese army remains responsible for a significant number of human rights violations, including sexual violence.''</p> <p>The opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) was at the sharp end of last year's election crackdown and claims soldiers were used to intimidate voters and interfere with ballot papers. It expressed concern at the use of British resources to train and support the military.</p> <p>Albert Moleka, the party's cabinet director and spokesman, said: \"Training is a normal part of the co-operation of our two countries but we might say it is the responsibility of the DRC to use those who have been trained properly. That can only be done by a legitimate political authority. Unfortunately we don't have a legitimate political authority. There is a huge gap of mistrust between the army and the population.\"</p> <p>He added: \"In our experience it is the elite troops with the best equipment who are used against the population. I think military co-operation should be attached with strict conditions that ensure force is never used against the people. That is difficult for outside countries to monitor.\"</p> <p>Moleka said there was a long tradition of Congo's military elite studying at academies in Britain and other foreign countries. \"But when they come back, what functions do they occupy? How can they help their country? They're not given the opportunity to bring what they learn to change the attitudes and behaviour of the army.\"</p> <p>The Congolese army, badly paid and fed, is still struggling to maintain discipline after the integration of a Tutsi rebel militia following a 2009 peace treaty. Yet the international community, including the world's biggest UN peacekeeping operation, has put faith in it to quell violence in the country's war-torn east.</p> <p>In May, Human Rights Watch reported that Sudanese government forces were carrying out indiscriminate bombings and abuses against civilians in southern Kordofan. It called on Sudan to investigate the discovery of a cluster bomb in the region. Witnesses interviewed in Blue Nile also described serious abuses by the armed forces. The onslaughts have <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/new-arrivals-in-south-sudan-tell-of-worst-war-crimes-since-darfur-7965160.html\" title=\"\">created tens of thousands of refugees living in appalling conditions</a>.</p> <p>John Ashworth, a church adviser who has lived in Sudan and South Sudan for three decades, said: \"While one might argue that helping an army to maintain professional standards could improve their human rights record, this is clearly not the case with the Sudanese army, which continues to commit atrocities against civilians in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, and continues to threaten its new neighbour, South Sudan.\"</p> <p>Ishag Mekki, a Darfur refugee in Britain who campaigns for the region, said: \"It is shame that the UK government behaves irresponsibly and assists a war crime government. It is an ethical matter not to stand firmly with victims of both countries. I am annoyed seeing ministers and government officials visit the UK on a regular basis for various businesses, but to train them is shocking. It means the people of Darfur will have to wait very long to persuade this government to change their mind.\"</p> <p>Pascal Kambale, DRC country director of the Open Society Initiative for West Africa, said: \"I don't think this is appropriate at all. The Congolese army badly needs complete reform and western donors \u2013 including the UK \u2013 have completely failed on their promise to help the Congolese government's effort to reform its army. Throwing this kind of big money into training not only is not in line with security sector reform programmes. It is also counterproductive because it comforts the Congo government into its lack of interest in reforming its army.\"</p>",
  "<p>Around midnight on the morning of 14 October 2006, shots were fired in an Albanian/Kosovan club in Park Royal, north-west London. One man, Prel Marku, died from a fatal injury to his brain and two others were wounded. The shooting was the result of a feud between two gangs over who had the right to rob the parking meters of the West End.</p> <p>The man who fired the fatal shots was Herland Bilali, who worked as a disco doorman, had a reputation for violence and was part of one of the gangs. He is now serving life for murder.</p> <p>Accompanying him into the club was a young man, Timi Spahiu, who is also serving a life sentence. He claims that he had no idea what Bilali had in mind and that he himself never fired a shot. His <a href=\"http://www.jointenterprise.co/\" title=\"\">supporters</a> claim he is a victim of the controversial joint enterprise laws and his will be one of the cases highlighted by a protest in Bradford later this month to draw attention to what campaigners say are serious miscarriages of justice. Under the \"joint enterprise\" doctrine a person may be convicted of a murder or manslaughter even if they did not fire the fatal shot or strike the fatal blow but were part of a group, one of whose members carried out the killing.</p> <p>At the centre of the shooting was a turf war between rival Albanian and Kosovan gangs over the theft of cash from parking meters in central London, mainly in the borough of Westminster, which claimed to have lost \u00a31,243,000 in one year alone as a result of the thefts.</p> <p>Bilali had already been involved in a confrontation over the dispute.</p> <p>Spahiu, who is 38 and was born in Kosovo, is married with two children but separated from his wife. He came to the UK in 1998 and was given permission to stay as someone claiming asylum. He knew Bilali but says that he had thought that the visit to the club was to be an attempt to sort out the dispute peacefully with a discussion between the two rival groups.</p> <p>The club was for members of the Albanian/Kosovan community to meet, drink and play chess and cards and the two men were admitted after pressing the entrance door buzzer. According to witnesses, Bilali came in, shouted an obscenity in Albanian, pulled out a gun and started firing. Marku, the man shot dead, was an innocent bystander not involved in the parking meter dispute.</p> <p>Spahiu said the first knowledge he had that Bilali had a gun was when they went into the club. \"It was all over in a matter of seconds,\" he said later. \"I turned and ran down the stairs ... I'd never seen anything like this before. I felt shocked, really bad.\" He said he asked Bilali why he had done it and Bilali said \"They wanted to kill me, they had guns.\"</p> <p>Both men fled, Spahiu to Salford. After a month he was arrested and told police that they were \"100% wrong\" about his involvement.</p> <p>He then remained silent, he said, on the advice of his lawyer. Bilali escaped to Denmark so Spahiu stood trial at Snaresbrook crown court without him. He was convicted and jailed for life with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 33 years. Bilali was eventually tracked down, extradited, tried and convicted and is also serving a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 34 years.</p> <p>Deborah Madden, a friend of Spahiu, who has been campaigning on his behalf since his arrest believes that he is another victim of the joint enterprise law. \"How can a man that did nothing \u2014 and all the witnesses say did nothing \u2014 now be serving 33 years?\" she said.</p> <p>Lawyers are now re-examining his case with a view to an appeal.</p>",
  "<p>The high court is to hear details of nearly 300 damages claims against News International for alleged News of the World phone hacking, from people including the late reality TV star Jade Goody.</p> <p>At least 155 new civil lawsuits \u2013 involving 174 individuals \u2013 for invasion of privacy were lodged with the high court by the 14 September deadline set by Mr Justice Vos, the high court judge overseeing the process.</p> <p>Vos will also be given an update from News International on its separate phone-hacking compensation scheme, which has accepted 137 claims, at a high court case management conference on Tuesday.</p> <p>The extent of phone hacking at the now-closed News of the World is expected to be confirmed by lawyers for both the claimants and News International. The 292 new claims are in addition to 58 lawsuits settled by the publisher earlier this year.</p> <p>Many of the names on the court register of claims are not well-known figures to the public and are what Lord Justice Leveson called \"collateral damage\" \u2013 relatives of celebrities or victims of crime, such as the parents of former nanny Louise Woodward, who was found guilty of manslaughter in the US when she was 19, and Lorna Hogan, the former girlfriend of Calum Best.</p> <p>Janet Woolf, the mother of Ken Livingstone's eldest child, is one who believes she was targeted because of her connection to a famous politician. Others who have not sought the public spotlight include Matthew Robertson, husband of Davina McCall.</p> <p>TV producer Kate Jackson, who made a fly-on-the-wall documentary about Goody as she was dying of cancer in 2009, is also making a claim along with two of the reality TV star's best friends, Simon Bridger and Danny Hayward. As executors of her estate, they are making the claims on her behalf.</p> <p>Lauren Pope, now known as a star from reality TV show The Only Way is Essex, is suing in relation to a night out with Prince Harry in 2004.</p> <p>Other civil claims not previously reported include actions taken by Yousef Bhailok, the former secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.</p> <p>On the entertainment front, former EastEnders actor Lacey Turner is suing as is Claire Powell, Kerry Katona's former agent, and Footballers' Wives actor Laila Rouass.</p> <p>Suzanne Dando, the former British Olympic gymnast and ex-girlfriend of former Sky Sports presenter Andy Gray, is also claiming damages for alleged hacking.</p> <p>Joining the ranks of current and former Premier League footballers seeking damages are Noel Whelan, Chris Kiwomya and Neil Ruddock.</p> <p>Among the other claimants who filed before Vos's 14 September deadline were actor Hugh Grant, the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and his wife Glenys, and former secretary of state for trade and industry Stephen Byers.</p> <p>The names of claimants will be confirmed before Vos during the case management conference on Tuesday.</p> <p>Earlier this month, he ordered a three- to four-day hearing in a bid to clear the way for potential trials of the second wave of phone-hacking claims against News International sometime after May next year.</p> <p>This second tranche of claims has become a protracted matter \u2013 this is ninth hearing this year \u2013 with ongoing legal arguments over what News International should and could reveal to claimants.</p> <p>The publisher settled 58 claims in January and February this year, including suits brought by Jude Law, Steve Coogan and Sienna Miller.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>During the recent summer holidays, 11-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/25/11-year-old-flies-rome-manchester\" title=\"\">Liam Corcoran left his home in Wythenshawe</a>, caught a bus to Manchester airport and boarded a Jet2 flight to Rome. The tabloids had a field day, but the incident highlights a serious concern for the travel industry: child safety and protection.</p> <p>Liam was escorted home on the return flight. But with millions of families jetting off on foreign holidays every year, what can the travel industry do to ensure their young charges arrive back unharmed?</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>The fact that an 11-year-old could board a plane without a ticket or accompanying adult raises very specific issues. Airport security was clearly grossly inadequate. UK Border Agency rules do not permit children to fly without correct documentation or boarding pass.</p> <p>Likewise, standard airline procedure requires security staff to check a child's boarding pass and passport at check-in and at the gate, as well as the boarding pass stub once the child is on board. A passenger headcount before take-off is also habitual \u2013 a procedure that Jet2 had discontinued, but has since reinstated.</p> <p>Over and above these routine checks, special provisions are in place for children (generally defined as under-16) who are travelling without adults. Responsibility for these unaccompanied minors falls to the airline or their handling agent, clarifies Sarah Brookes, head of public affairs at Manchester airport.</p> <p>Policies on unaccompanied minors differ from airline to airline. In the case of Jet2, it \u2013 supposedly \u2013 operates a blanket ban on children flying without an accompanying adult. Higher-end carriers are more lenient. British Airways, for instance, will carry unaccompanied children under 12 as long as they are registered under its <a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com/travel/childinfo/public/en_gb\" title=\"\">Skyflyer Solo</a> service.</p> <p>The UK carrier insists that the child is checked-in in person, not online or at an airport kiosk, and that the adult stays in the airport until the plane has left. Other provisions include photographs of the person responsible for meeting the child at the other end.</p> <p>Ferry and train companies exhibit a <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Yourchildshealthandsafety/Roadandtravelsafety/DG_10037078\" title=\"\">similar range of policies</a>. Many ferry companies refuse to take unaccompanied children full-stop. Others have an age limit. Eurostar, for instance, will not take unaccompanied children under 12, but <a href=\"http://www.eurostar4agents.com/a-z/unaccompanied_minors.htm\" title=\"\">\"will consider\"</a> taking children aged between 13-17.</p> <p>Breaches are possible, but extremely rare, transport operators say. In Jet2's case, the airline undertook a thorough investigation following the Corcoran affair. \"Revised procedures have now been implemented,\" clarifies Gaby O'Grady, a spokesperson for the airline.</p> <p><strong>Once on holiday </strong></p> <p>Travelling alone is the exception. The vast majority of children heading abroad for their holidays do so in the company of their family. Ensuring these child holidaymakers come to no harm starts with basic health and safety in their hotel or resort, insists Angela Hills, destination services manager at the UK travel trade association <a href=\"http://www.abta.com\" title=\"\">Abta</a>.</p> <p>Abta produces a Health and Safety Technical Guide, which includes child-specific safety measures, such as signing children in and out of the hotel, and notification of parents' contact details. Since the guide was introduced in 2003, Abta has distributed it to all its 5,500 members, plus around 40,000 suppliers.</p> <p>At a facilities level, child-related risks tend to be wrapped up in general health and safety management, according to Barbara Powell, senior director of corporate social responsibility at the hotel chain Marriott International.</p> <p>Where specific child protection policies kick in is to cover child violence or trafficking. Since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/madeleinemccann\" title=\"\">Madeleine McCann</a> case in Portugal in 2007, such issues have become a top-line priority for the tourism industry, notes Abta's Hills.</p> <p>Marriott follows many other large hoteliers and tour operators in having tailored training for all its employees on <a href=\"http://www.marriott.com/corporate-social-responsibility/community-involvement.mi\" title=\"\">child protection and human rights</a>. The training provides guidance on how to spot suspicious activity, as well as protocols on how to report it, Powell explains.</p> <p>\"We don't put this in the hands of an associate [hotel employee] as it's too sensitive\", she states. \"Instead, they are told to report it to their supervisor and then it goes through a chain of command in the hotel.\"</p> <p>It falls to the hotel's head of security or hotel manager to then investigate and intervene if necessary. Depending on the seriousness of the case, hotel security will either approach the guest directly or put in a call to the local police.</p> <p>Marriott's position keeps with the zero tolerance approach set out in the Industry Position Statement on Human Trafficking \u2013 a collective agreement drawn up by members of the <a href=\"http://www.tourismpartnership.org\" title=\"\">International Tourism Partnership</a>, which represents 16 global hoteliers.</p> <p>Leading tour operators take a similar approach. <a href=\"http://www.thomson.co.uk/editorial/child-protection.html\" title=\"\">The global travel company TUI</a> has gone further than most. Working with children's charity <a href=\"http://www.nspcc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NSPCC</a>, it has set up a train-the-trainer programme that sees all its 350 childcare staff receive instruction on child protection issues. This is in addition to the child safety content of the NVQ2 qualification required of all TUI's childcare staff.</p> <p>In addition, NSPCC provides a 24-hour helpline service that TUI staff can call when suspicious incidents arise. The charity's expert staff can advise them on what action to take locally, as well as dealing with social services and other agencies in the child's place of residency.</p> <p>\"While kids are away, we need to make sure that doesn't become a vulnerable time\", clarifies Ian Chapman, director of holiday experience at the TUI brands <a href=\"http://www.thomson.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Thomson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.firstchoice.co.uk/\" title=\"\">First Choice</a>. \"The NVQ and in-house training, plus the NSPCC partnership, means that we've been able to deal directly with the handful of cases that we've had or pass them on to the appropriate authorities.\"</p> <p>The tourism sector cannot make the scourge of child trafficking disappear for good. That said, it is making \"positive\" steps to combat it when incidents occur, insists Fran Hughes, spokesperson for the International Tourism Partnership.</p> <p>\"We've gone from a position where child trafficking wasn't on the radar for some companies\", she notes, \"to one where they are developing their own policies and training.\"</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>On a visit to Afghanistan earlier this month, I spent an afternoon at <a href=\"http://skateistan.org/content/our-story\" title=\"\">Skateistan</a>, a project in Kabul that offers some of the poorest children in the world a chance to be children. They come to Skateistan to play, skate and learn. What struck me about these kids was their display of both childish playfulness and a kind of maturity you can only get with years of experience.</p> <p>Fourteen-year-old Khorshid embodied both of these qualities. When I met her \u2013 just a few days before she was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/circle-childhood-friends-bomb-kabul\" title=\"\">killed by a suicide bomber</a> \u2013 she approached me with a smile and asked if I could skate. When I said no, she immediately offered to show me how. As I tentatively got on the skateboard, propped up by Khorshid and Madina, her friend and fellow skater, she told me not to be scared.</p> <p>This is the reality of people living in Afghanistan. Ordinary people tread the line between life and death every day. When they go out for work, or to buy groceries or to pick up their children from school there is a chance they will die on the way there or on the way back. Eleven years after international troops entered Afghanistan to \"liberate\" Afghans from the tyranny of the Taliban, Afghans still live in a state of war.</p> <p>There are some things that have changed in the past decade. Returning to Afghanistan after 20 years living abroad, I was glad to see that Kabul, almost completely destroyed by two decades of war, is now rebuilt. The roads are paved and all around you see evidence of industry. Mobile phone companies are advertising their services on giant billboards on the side of the roads and posh supermarkets have sprung up all over Kabul to cater for its expat and foreign populations.</p> <p>There is a bustling rhythm of life in Kabul. But all around there is also sinister evidence of violence. Security checkpoints sit every few hundred metres on streets. You can always hear the roar of military helicopters and planes and for me perhaps the most poignant sign of insecurity was that few women were out on the streets. They don't feel safe and you can't blame them. Suicide attacks, unheard of before 2001, have become a regular occurrence in Kabul. Attacks seem to be completely random and often it is just civilians who perish.</p> <p>Despite this terrible fear and violence that people experience on a daily basis, there is an even greater worry that preoccupies Afghans now. Many believe that the departure of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force\" title=\"\">Isaf troops</a> will prompt another bloody civil war. No one is certain of his or her fate after 2014. Talking to Kabulis about the exit of international troops reminded me more of doomsday prophecies you might read about in cult literature than anything else. Even the children at Skateistan were talking about it. When I interviewed Madina, Khorshid's friend, about her life and her future, she talked about her hope for a peaceful Afghanistan where she could go to school and pursue skateboarding.</p> <p>What became clear to me from my interactions there and with other ordinary Afghans is that there is no ideology or group that Afghans feel so strongly about as to warrant them to fight. In fact, many feel that there isn't a single party that represents them or caters for their everyday needs. There is a profound sense of fatigue that comes from being in the middle of powerful forces that they can't control.</p> <p>After three decades of war the Afghan people I spoke to want peace. For this to happen, it is imperative that 2014 does not bring another gory conflict to Afghanistan. But it seems the British government is in danger of limiting its exit strategy to a public relations campaign. If there is going to be peace and stability in Afghanistan, the British and the US administrations must work to create a clear and robust framework for exiting Afghanistan. This must include a viable strategy for negotiating with the Taliban and clear terms for power sharing after the troops leave.</p> <p>Afghanistan needs a credible plan for how to continue reconstruction and the building of its economy; and it must include a plan B: what would happen if parties didn't keep to their end of the bargain. If Afghanistan is left without a realistic plan for peace, it will further jeopardise an already unstable region, threaten our own security and more children like Khorshid will die in brutal and pointless acts of violence.</p>",

She couldn't understand \u2013 surely there had been some law that he had broken? In the end, sure enough, there was. He was eventually convicted and sentenced for seven years for soliciting murder and racial hatred.\"</p> <p>A clearly surprised James Naughtie, interviewing Gardner, described this revelation as \"a corker\". Gardner said: \"Yes, I thought I'd drop that in. She told me.\"</p> <p>Gardner said: \"She spoke to the home secretary at the time and said, surely this man must have broken some laws. Why is he still at large? He was conducting these radical activities and he called Britain a toilet. He was incredibly anti-British and yet he was sucking up money from this country for a long time. He was a huge embarrassment to Muslims, who condemned him.\"</p> <p>The general convention for people conversing with the Queen, for example at palace receptions, is that whatever is said remains off the record.</p> <p>A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said she had no comment on Gardner's interview.</p> <p>Gardner did not specify which home secretary was lobbied, but it appears most likely to be David Blunkett, who held the post from 2001 to 2004, at the peak of Abu Hamza's infamy before he was arrested. Following his initial arrest in August 2004, Abu Hamza was convicted in 2006 of 11 charges connected to soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred.</p> <p>There was no immediate comment from Blunkett's office.</p> <p>A spokesman for the republican pressure group Republic said the comments, if true, showed the monarch had needlessly \"waded into the debate\". He said: \"It is up to parliament and the courts to deal with these complex issues, not the Queen. Monarchists argue the Queen always remains above politics. Clearly that is not the case.\"</p> <p>The government has battled for eight years to secure Hamza's extradition to the US, where he is wanted in connection with alleged plans to establish a terrorist training camp in Oregon, as well as claims he provided material support to the Taliban. He is also wanted in connection with allegations that he was involved in hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998.</p> <p>Abu Hamza's fight against extradition ended on Monday when the European court of human rights rejected his appeal, as well as those of four other terrorism suspects, and agreed an earlier ruling that their human rights would not be violated by the prospect of life sentences and solitary confinement in a US prison.</p>",

Looking back to 1962, I recall a discussion of Dr No on The Critics, the weekly arts programme I then produced, which attracted an audience of several million on the BBC's Home Service (now Radio 4). The chairman that week was the tweedy middle-aged novelist and critic Walter Allen, and at one point the youngest of the six participants, the playwright John Bowen, intervened, saying: \"I think you're all being rather patronising.\" There was the slightest pause before Allen retorted with a sigh, \"Well, if you can't patronise Ian Fleming, who can you patronise?\" It was a view I rather agreed with at the time, and for some years afterwards.</p> <p>Fifty years later, however \u2013 having seen all the Bond pictures and reviewed most of them \u2013 I'm inclined for several reasons, to like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/85424/dr-no\" title=\"\">Dr No</a> far more than any of its successors, though as I've suggested, I think <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/nov/19/jamesbond.danielcraig\" title=\"\">Casino Royale is the best</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396650270\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348499720907/DR-NO-010.jpg\" alt=\"DR NO\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Lord as Felix Leiter and Sean Connery as Bond in Dr No. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar/Cinetext Collection</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/Allstar/Cinetext Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first reason is that the Bond series was not then a franchise (a term that was not to be applied to the cinema for decades to come).

Dr No is a modest thriller with a tough, stylish hero of some charm doing his job without the assistance of elaborate ordnance or eye-popping gadgetry. He pursues women, but doesn't attract them as if he possessed some magical power or irresistible magnetism. In his first star role, Sean Connery is confident but not arrogant, a man comfortable in a dinner jacket but not born to the purple. Like Albert Finney and Peter O'Toole, whose careers took off at much the same time, he's a harbinger of a major social change in class, fashion and behaviour that seemed attractive at the time and was later to take less likable forms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396650271\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348499847062/DR-NO-008.jpg\" alt=\"DR NO\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Sean Connery is confident but not arrogant' \u2026 a scene from Dr No. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/United Artists</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/UNITED ARTISTS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of what were to be standard ingredients in the series are here at the start \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q9QyChJeNU\" title=\"\">opening credits</a> with the familiar Bond theme accompanying the hero shooting straight into the camera lens, <a href=\"http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/villains/dr_no.php3\" title=\"\">the outlandish villain</a> with his plans of world domination, the Bond girls to be bedded and left to their fates, the cynical quips that accompany the deaths of foes and so on.

  "<p>I have been surprised by my recent conversations with local government executive and political leaders, some of whom seem to think that the financial challenges we have faced are behind them and that no further change is necessary. I admit the number taking this view is small and I have not undertaken a scientific survey, but that anyone can think this seems to me incredible.</p> <p>Given the government's policy on the public deficit \u2013 and the current increases in this deficit, fall in tax revenues and the generally perilous state of the UK economy \u2013 such optimism is seriously misplaced.</p> <p>The risk that the government would seek further cuts in public expenditure, other than possibly taking a further \u00a310bn from welfare benefits, prior to the 2015 general election seems to be receding. It is more likely to extend short term borrowing. However, after 2015 no government of any political persuasion is likely to avoid further cuts or increase local government expenditure.</p> <p>Welfare cuts are already adding to local government finance pressures and there could be more to come. This is a perverse localism that transfers responsibilities and costs without any obvious local advantage.</p> <p>If the political priorities remain the NHS, education and international development (and these are legitimate political choices), local government could find itself squeezed into the position of only just about being to afford social and child care, and waste management. The absence of a government commitment to implementing the Dilnot recommendations on social care, and more significantly to increasing national resources for social care, is again piling pressure on council budgets.</p> <p>Local government's financial prospects are bleak; so are the prospects and life opportunities for many people dependent on local authorities and public services. Local government has to oppose and expose the damage being done by central government policies and expenditure cuts, but that alone will not be enough and would be a betrayal of local people as much as not opposing the cuts would be.</p> <p>Local authority managers could so easily collapse into self pity and despair, blaming central government and dodging tough local decisions. Thankfully only a very few will do this. The vast majority will recognise their duty to minimise the damage to local communities and local citizens \u2013 especially the most vulnerable.</p> <p>So when I hear officers saying that the worst of the cuts are behind them my response is, I doubt it. So what are you going to do meet your responsibilities to local communities and local citizens?</p> <p>There are no simple answers, and if there were they would have been universally adopted already. Trying to fulfil your obligations and remain an exciting organisation is difficult; death by salami slicing rapidly obliterates dynamism.</p> <p>Every possible efficiency saving should be sought, provided that it does not have an unintended adverse consequences, though efficiency savings alone will not be enough; productivity should be increased wherever it can.</p> <h2>Local authority goals</h2> <p>Any dynamic local authorities must to do more. It has to shift its behaviour and its relationship with others. I suggest that there are six actions councils should take:</p> <p>1. Set a medium-term vision for place in partnership with other organisations in the public, business and third sectors, and through informed and honest dialogue with local people.</p> <p>2. Based on this vision, adopt strategic objectives for the local authority itself.</p> <p>3. Review all current expenditure and actions against the strategic options. Be willing to do different things in different ways, funded in new ways to secure the desired result. Set clear outcomes targets; stop doing some things while starting other new activities to meet new and contemporary needs. Where possible, switch resources into prevention.</p> <p>4. Develop place-shaping and community leadership. Look to influence and bring into play all the available resources in the area, not just the council's own coffers.</p> <p>5. Ensure that local people, the voluntary and community sector, businesses, suppliers, contractors and staff are engaged in decision making.</p> <p>6. Adopt behaviours and processes that enable the authority to collaborate, partner and share with and where appropriate cede power to others \u2013 other local public sector agencies, the VCS, neighbourhoods and citizens.</p> <p>I am aware of local authorities across the country adopting all or most of these. They are willing to experiment, to challenge themselves and invite others to challenge them, and know that they have to change to be relevant to their communities.</p> <p>But there are also those not willing or able to make the necessary changes. They are not in a good place and they will not be good places to live in. The reality is that, even without the government's programme of expenditure cuts, major change would have been necessary and desirable to meet demographic movements, public expectations, and the localism and personalisation agendas, to stimulate local regeneration and to sustain local government itself.</p> <p>Significant change is inevitable. It must be locally led at a political level, locally designed and locally appropriate. It must not be imposed by central government. Local government, from individuals to collective action, must resist further national imposition whilst at the same arguing for greater devolution of powers properly financed.</p> <p>Local government can remain exciting and dynamic but only if its leaders face up to the reality and move ahead, taking local control.</p> <p><em>John Tizard is an independent strategic advisor and commentator on public policy, and a member of the Guardian local government network editorial advisory panel</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Claims that the privacy of direct messages sent between Facebook users had been compromised and that the messages were appearing publicly on users' timelines are false, the social networking service has said.</p> <p>There was confusion on Monday amid reports in France that non-public messages sent in the years from 2007 onwards had started to appear in timelines, sparking many users to check back in the fear that potentially embarrassing private messages had become widely viewable.</p> <p>Facebook's share price fell 9.1% to $20.79 at the close in New York on the back of the fears, the biggest drop since 27 July. The stock has slumped 45% since its May initial public offering, and hasn't traded above its $38 IPO price since the day after the share sale.</p> <p>A Facebook spokesperson later said that an investigation was launched after \"a small number\" of users raised concerns after what they believed to be private messages appeared on their timelines.</p> <p>\"Our engineers investigated these reports and found that the messages were older wall posts that had always been visible on the users' profile pages. Facebook is satisfied that there has been no breach of user privacy,\" he added.</p> <p>The company has suggested that much of confusion was because of how differently people used Facebook in 2007, when there was no comments feature and the like button did not exist. As a result, wall posts were used more often and in some cases people may have used wall posts instead of private messages by mistake, according to the company. </p> <p>Facebook investigated a similar claim late last year, which the company found to be false.</p> <p>It also said on Monday that, from a technical perspective, private messages and wall posts were treated very differently and that no mechanism has ever been created that would allow a private message to be published on timelines.</p> <p>One suggestion for why the issue emerged on Monday was because France, where the first cases of people expressing concern about the potential exposure of private messages, was the most recent place where Facebook's Timeline feature was being introduced.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khadr\" title=\"\">Omar Khadr</a> has grown from boy to man at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. In 2002 the 15-year-old Khadr, a Canadian, was captured by US forces during a firefight in Afghanistan and taken first to Bagram airbase and then to Guant\u00e1namo, where he eventually pleaded guilty to throwing a grenade that killed a US soldier. A decade on, Khadr \u2013 the only child solder to be prosecuted in a military commission for war crimes \u2013 remains in the detention centre while his lawyers press the Canadian government to honour its promise to bring him home.</p> <p>Canada has come under fire for its apparent use of delaying tactics to keep Khadr, the last western citizen left at Guant\u00e1namo, locked up in a facility where he has been abused and his rights violated. Ottawa demanded and has now received video footage of psychiatric interviews with Khadr, which will be used to determine whether he is still a danger to society. Meanwhile, thousands of people have signed a petition urging the government to stick to a deal that would enable him to serve the last eight years of his sentence (reduced from 40 in a plea bargain) in Canada. On 12 September, the office of the prime minister, Stephen Harper, took to Twitter to deny reports that his repatriation is imminent \u2013 suggestions of Khadr's return don't play well with rightwing supporters, and many Liberals have similar reservations.</p> <p>The foot-dragging is just the latest episode in the shameful abandonment of a young man whose fate is a problem no one wants to deal with (<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/09/13/omar-khadr-canada-guantanamo-bay-return.html\" title=\"\">Canada is blaming US officialdom for the hold-ups</a>). That Barack Obama's broken promise to close Guant\u00e1namo is not a bigger issue in the election campaign seems to reflect a wide belief in the US that its inmates are somehow below the law. Even more than in most cases of diplomatic buck-passing, there is a jarring disparity between the high-level politicking and the low-level reality (of Khadr's life in Guant\u00e1namo). But neither this divergence nor the decade of injustices Khadr has suffered would not have come to pass were it not for the absurd notion that a teenager caught up in combat is the public enemy.</p> <p>It has never been proven that Khadr himself threw the grenade that killed sergeant Christopher Speer. One witness initially reported that the teenager was lying on the ground, already injured and bleeding, when the grenade was lobbed at the American. In October 2010 Khadr \u2013 who had previously denied the claims \u2013 pleaded guilty to five war crimes, including throwing the grenade, before a military commission convened under US laws created to try terrorist suspects. Those laws have been widely criticised by human rights organisations.</p> <p>Khadr's lawyers said later he told them the confessions had been obtained after torture. Some aspects of Khadr's treatment at Bagram and Guant\u00e1namo are indisputable: in an affidavit submitted in February 2008, Khadr described in detail how he was mistreated by his captors at Bagram. The documentary film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/06/four-days-inside-guantanamo-review\" title=\"\">Four Days Inside Guant\u00e1namo</a> gives a flavour of how he was handled following his transfer to the detention centre in Cuba.</p> <p>Even if Khadr were guilty of the five war crimes he confessed to, he was under 18 at the time he allegedly committed them and therefore entitled to \"special protection\" under the terms of the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which governs the involvement of children in armed conflict. The protocol, to which the US is a signatory, recognises \"the special needs of those children who are particularly vulnerable to recruitment or use in hostilities\" and requires countries that sign it to \"promote the physical and pyschosocial rehabilitation and social reintegration of children who are victims of armed conflict\". It is safe to say this is not what happened to Khadr. Guilty or not, he has fulfilled his part of the bargain and should at least now be allowed to return home, to serve his remaining time on Canadian soil.</p> <p>Sending Khadr home without further delay might go some way to acknowledging that his role in that firefight in Afghanistan was in fact a grim violation of his own innocence, that an impressionable teenage boy had been drawn into a conflict zone because of his father's links with al-Qaida. Those who want an end to the involvement of children in armed conflict are not the only ones uncomfortable with the fact that the US can apparently kill with impunity but combatants on the other side must be terrorists.</p> <p>A letter from Khadr to his lawyer Dennis Edney in May 2010 appeared to sum it up: \"You say I have an obligation to show the world what is going on down here and we have done everything but the world still doesn't get it. So it might work if the world sees the US sentencing a child to prison, it might show the world how unfair and sham this process is, and if the world doesn't seen all this, to what am I being released to? A world of hate, unjust [sic] and discrimination.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was once feared that travelling faster than 20mph would blow your eyes out. Ford Motors and the Wright brothers must be pleased this thesis didn't prevail. Today, fear and opportunity hang in an equally acute balance, where the opportunity is as significant as the fear that curtails it. As the online harvest of personal data grows \u2013 further when it comes into contact with more data \u2013 how do we balance creative and commercial opportunities with concerns and fears that personal information won't be used responsibly?</p> <p>Trust in the system is at an all-time low. According to the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/reding/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">European Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding</a>, 72% of European citizens are concerned that their personal data may be misused, worried that companies may be passing on their data to other companies without their permission. In addition, highly publicised data breaches such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/may/03/sony-data-breach-online-entertainment\" title=\"\">Sony 2011 hacking</a> add to a climate of fear.</p> <p>This climate undermines myriad commercial opportunities, which are arising just when the internet's economic value is expected to nearly double by 2016 to $4.2 trillion. Research by the Boston Consulting Group on the internet economy in the G20 predicted that online retail will grow to $2tn by 2016. However, this estimate is influenced by perceptions of trust in how personal data is used \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_IT_RethinkingPersonalData_Report_2012.pdf\" title=\"\">BCG argued</a> that online retail could grow even faster to $2.5tn by 2016 with enhanced trust or to only $1.5tn if trust were to be eroded.</p> <p>The irony is that consumers have much to gain through sharing personal data and by understanding what data exists on them, either for making smarter purchases or exploring commercial opportunities \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2011/nov/midata\" title=\"\">the government's Midata project</a>, being debated in the enterprise and regulatory reform bill, enables consumers to demand the transaction data companies store on them. This will allow consumers to understand their spending patterns better and become smarter shoppers.</p> <p>To achieve greater trust, a more accountable culture must be developed that works across governmental, private and non-governmental spheres, in which consumers understand what data can and cannot be shared, and that all data shared must be done with regards to the context in which it is gathered. Public data collected by public bodies must remain accessible, and everybody must have access to their own data.</p> <p>In the 1990s, if you wanted a name, address and telephone number you were at the mercy of leviathans such as BT or the Royal Mail. But you, whose data it was, could only access it when it was sold back to you at premium rates. My mission in creating <a href=\"http://www.192.com/\" title=\"\">192.com</a> was to make the data available only to large companies available to everyone. In 1997, I broke BT's monopoly of directory enquiries and added the edited electoral roll to the telephone directory, supplying directory enquiries for free. To do so, I had to win a high court case against the Royal Mail, and beat off a series of legal threats from BT \u2013 I also wanted to give you greater control over what data exists on you, first by informing people what information there is about them in the public domain, clearly citing its source. At the same time, I allowed people to easily remove themselves from our databases if they wanted to.</p> <p>By collating data already in the public domain, the context had been established, namely, for reuniting family and friends or conducting ID checks, although it's troubling that such a battle had to be fought.</p> <p>With the right codes of practice, the results can be extraordinary \u2013 only this week I heard about a chap in Holland using the 192 site to reunite with a 1979 pen friend in Croydon, before a marriage between the pair next year. This is one of thousands of reunions that the website facilitates every year, reflecting the wider use of the edited electoral roll that also helps charities like the Salvation Army.</p> <p>In addition to context, a post-Wikileaks world requires accountability \u2013 if we are not accountable, someone will account for us. Perhaps this is the thinking behind the UK government's <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Open Data</a> initiative, which makes public data available so we can better understand policy decisions and see the \"raw data driving government forward\".</p> <p>This accountability can be conducted even more personally, with web users' behaviour becoming far more visible. We've launched <a href=\"http://www.192.com/people/see-who-is-searching-for-you/\" title=\"\">See Who's Searching For You</a> (SWS), which shows users who has been looking for them on 192.com. SWS allows users to send a message to the person searching for them, and see what information they've accessed. We are the first UK directory to do this. While hoping to reunite more friends and family through SWS, we are also reflecting a similar functionality to LinkedIn, in which online searches are made visible to the person being researched. Knowing what's visible about us and knowing who's viewed it will help the system to remain auditable, and this should give people even more confidence when putting their data in the public domain.</p> <p>A significant challenge for a more accountable internet is social media. How can we be sure that what is said on social media is true? A Facebook quarterly report this year reported that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-83m-profiles-bogus-fake\" title=\"\">83 million profiles were fake</a> and our own study found that <a href=\"http://www.journalism.co.uk/press-releases/love-online-192-com-reveals-online-dating-fears/s66/a540156/\" title=\"\">one in five lie about their marital status</a> when dating online.</p> <p>The answer is by tempering social media with factual resources. By knowing where somebody lives, who they live with, and if their company really exists and is financially healthy, we are in a better position to know if the imagery of social media tallies with the facts. This is particularly important when transacting online through auction sites \u2013 our research found that 17% of UK consumers have been defrauded when shopping online.</p> <p>By 2015 a trillion devices will be connected to the internet. Mobile phones, cars, home appliances, point of sale machines and even medical devices will record unprecedented volumes of data \u2013 about you. It's vital that this data is as secure as it is accurate, that there are uniform, international codes of conduct about its storage and sharing.</p> <p>It's particularly important that the biggest player in this equation remains the individual. The individual must be empowered to take greater control over the use of data created by and about him. As more data is created on people, there must be an ever more sensitive balance between privacy and accountability.</p> <p><em>Alastair Crawford is founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.192.com/\" title=\"\"><em>192.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Local government is preparing to take on a wider remit for public health from April next year, so the <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence</a> (Nice), which oversees clinical practice, is preparing information to assist councillors and local authority staff in finding out which public health policies are most effective in improving health while providing the best value for money.</p> <p>Local government public health briefings have been developed with contributions from councillors, local government officers, public health professionals and others with an interest in community health.</p> <p>They are based on existing Nice public health guidance, which sets out what interventions work best to keep people healthy. Such actions also often save money, both in the short and long-term.</p> <p>The main recommendations from this wealth of Nice guidance are being distilled and collated under specific topics to to create briefings, which are specifically written to support local government in its expanded role.</p> <p>The briefings are concise and easy to digest and, although evidence-based, they will carry their evidence lightly. They will not set out \"must dos\" for local authorities, but instead offer a menu of evidence-based advice so that commissioning and services can be tailored in response to different local circumstances, priorities and needs.</p> <p>Some of the briefings have recently been published on the <a href=\"www.nice.org.uk/localgovernment\" title=\"\">Nice website</a>, and cover tobacco, workplace health and physical activity. They include why each topic is an important issue to tackle and how local communities will benefit as a result, presented along with examples of good practice and quick facts and figures to make a case for action.</p> <p>Examples of effective recommendations highlighted in the new briefings include:</p> <p>\u2022 Tobacco: ensuring that environmental health and trading standards services prioritise tobacco control; making your organisation an exemplar in smokefree policies and in the support provided to help employees stop smoking; involving local communities and target groups in encouraging people to stop smoking</p> <p>\u2022 Workplace health: offering advice in the workplace to improve employees' wellbeing, and to address specific, often work-related conditions such as musculoskeletal disorders and stress; encouraging a leadership and management style that supports and improves people's mental wellbeing; supporting a culture of healthy eating, such as providing affordable choices that can contribute to a healthy diet in canteens and vending machines</p> <p>\u2022 Physical activity: making local facilities and services easily accessible by foot or bike; promoting active travel to schools, colleges and other workplaces; designing new developments to encourage physical activity</p> <p>The public health briefings are aimed at local government staff and councillors, their partners and other stakeholders with an interest in public health. They will cover a broad array of topics, populations and settings where Nice has already developed evidence-based guidance.</p> <p>Case studies and shared learning will be important elements of the briefings; for example, by providing a template business plan, or descriptions that demonstrate how others have met similar challenges. The briefings will also be a useful tool for the scrutiny processes within local government.</p> <p>The briefings will help local government to make the case for investment and disinvestment, ensure commissioning decisions are informed by independent, robust evidence from credible sources, and demonstrate how to translate evidence into the local context to address short and longer term priorities.</p> <p>Given the current economic climate it's more important than ever to make best use of limited funds, and research clearly shows the value of public health action and its potential to save resources while improving health. Nice hopes that this practical advice will be useful to local government as it gets ready for its new public health responsibilities.</p> <p><em>Phillip Woodward chair of the independent local government reference group at </em><a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Nice</em></a><em>, and former local authority chief executive.</em></p> <p><em>The healthcare network is hosting its next Public Health Dialogue event on </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/sep/03/public-health-dialogue-embracing-partnerships\" title=\"\"><em>embracing partnerships</em></a><em> at the Guardian offices next month.

Sienna</p> <p><strong>How do different governments compare when it comes to the relationship between politicians and civil servants?</strong></p> <p>In all countries, relationships between politicians and civil servants are problematic; most are politicised. In many countries, reformist forces are struggling to professionalise their civil services, which is often likened to de-politicisation.</p> <p>Legal predictability and accountability, impartiality, professional integrity, meritocracy and political neutrality should be enshrined in law and reflected in civil servants' attitudes and management practice.</p> <p>In certain countries, creating a senior civil service corps is seen as a way to improve professionalism. However, this should not be encouraged in little-developed administrations, where the politicisation of upper levels remains too high.</p> <p><strong>The UK government is </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/03/tender-outsourced-policy-thinktanks-decline\" title=\"\"><strong>commissioning a review of overseas administrations</strong></a><strong>.

The priority was creating a private sector, but the government neglected simultaneously to build a robust state able to regulate it. International institutions encouraged the privatisation of public assets and a business-like approach to the management of the public administration, as propounded by the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story094/en/index.html\" title=\"\">Washington consensus</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_public_management\" title=\"\">new public management movement</a>. The private business sector, often resulting from foreign investments, proposed attractive remuneration packages, while the public administration salaries were frequently frozen or directly reduced.</p> <p><strong>What three lessons have taught you most during your career?</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The approaches to reform of public administration need to be modest and should be made only when really necessary. Do not propose changes only because you are enticed by them, intellectually or otherwise.</p> <p>\u2022 Communication is a tool for creating consensus about possible change strategies and goals, not to impose on others decisions already taken by you.</p> <p>\u2022 It is crucial to embed change strategy into the cultural environment of a country or organisation.

  "<p>It's not fraud, but it probably is theft. Fraud is \"wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain\". Fraud would involve inducing the shopkeeper to part with the money, which is hardly the case with too much change.</p> <p>But knowingly taking too much is theft, defined as the unauthorised taking, keeping or using of another's property. Legally speaking this does not extend to accepting that extra coin accidentally, for the act of theft has to be accompanied by a <em>mens rea</em> \u2013 a \"guilty mind\" \u2013 which includes the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the rightful possession of their property or its use.</p> <p>So if you know you have done it, and you know this is wrong (otherwise you would not ask the question) then it is wrong. Irrespective of the law, staff are often forced to make up shortages in the till at the end of the day from their own pockets. Hand it back.</p>",
  "<p>Back in 2007, several friends and I living in London were already determined to do something to address what we saw as a potentially catastrophic lack of imagination in alternative ways of living. We wanted to form an association which would be run on democratic principles, would be open to everyone throughout Europe and indeed beyond, and, most importantly to us, would be transnational in its operations, activities and decision-making.</p> <p>Many of us were from different European countries, had come to London for one reason or another, and did not know how long we would stay. Several of us lived between London and another European city: we didn't consider our lives divided by national borders which can be crossed more or less freely, and we didn't want an association that would be divided in this way either. We wanted to form a co-operative association you could be part of no matter where you moved in Europe.</p> <p>That the organisation should be run on co-operative principles, in particular that it should have voluntary and open membership, should be run by its members democratically, should be independent, work with like-minded organisations and promote the education of its members and general public, were all relatively easy decisions to take. We saw these principles as the bare minimum for an association wanting to promote a different kind of way of living together in Europe and promote our overarching goals of \"democracy, equality and culture beyond the nation-state\".</p> <p>Much more difficult was to decide on an appropriate legal structure, for one simple reason: almost all legal structures available to us are nationally bounded; they have to be located in one nation state or another, and cannot move from that nation state once they are formed. There is a single market in the European Union, which makes it easier for a legal entity based in one member state to be active in other European countries, but making everyone join an entity based on one member state of the European Union rather than another went against our principles of creating an association as transnational as our lives. An option would have been to create associations in as many member states as we had members, and then create a federation of such \"national\" organisations. We had two problems with this.</p> <p>The first, that such a \"national\" division in the organisation went against our objective of \"going beyond the nation-state\": we feared that with nationally constituted associations, we'd be forced into a logic of these associations negotiating with each other, much like nation-states do in Europe at the moment. This went against the principle of the members directly having democratic ownership of the organisation: if we had a federation, the members would be represented at the European level by the national organisation they are part of, rather than having direct ownership of it.</p> <p>The second, more practical problem was simply that for many of us it made no choice to try to \"choose\" which country we were part of: should I be in the \"UK, French, Italian or Romanian organisation?\" was a question that made no sense for me and would, I feel, only have an arbitrary answer.</p> <p>Nor does the problem of how we should be legally organised currently have a perfect answer. The solution we found for the time being was to create something called a <a href=\"http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/businesses/company_law/l26015_en.htm\" title=\"\">European Economic Interest Grouping</a>. This is one of the few legal entities which can be created directly in European law, and can have and transfer its head office in any member state. As the name suggests, it groups together entities based in several member states into one grouping. As the name also suggests, the legal form has not been made primarily with the idea of non-profit associations or cooperatives in mind.</p> <p>There is a <em>European Co-operative</em> legal form, which is better in many respects, but has a large capital requirement which made it unattainable for us. There has been talk in Brussels for many years of creating a <em>European Association</em> status which may be much more appropriate for us, but there are still few details or commitments. What our legal status does allow us to do is to treat the European entity as the primary entity of our association, and the members have ownership directly over what it does. In experimenting with this model we believe we are trying to live an alternative for the future of Europe, and we will keep on experimenting with the organisation on the basis of promoting democracy, equality and culture.</p> <p>Since 2007 our growing membership has come to believe promoting these ideals is ever more important.</p> <p><em>Niccolo Milanese is co-president of </em><a href=\"http://www.euroalter.com\" title=\"\"><em>European Alternatives</em></a><em>, a transnational civil society organisation working to promote democracy, equality, and culture throughout Europe.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Ahn Sung-rye was a nurse when the limp, bloodstained bodies of young men and women started arriving at her hospital in central Gwangju on 18 May 1980.</p> <p>\"There were bodies strewn across the corridors and mothers screaming as they searched for their children, but it was so chaotic, there was nothing I could do to help them,\" she says. \"We didn't even have time to sterilise the medical instruments before taking patients into surgery.\"</p> <p>Ahn had no idea at the time, but her patients were the first casualties of an uprising that was to mark the beginning of South Korea's transformation from military dictatorship to liberal democracy. Those events live on in the city's collective memory in the form of the Gwangju Biennale \u2013 two months of art, film and performance launched in 1995 to honour its citizens' sacrifice, seven years before South Korea became a democracy.</p> <p>When the ninth biennale opened in the south-west city earlier this month, Ahn, who appears in one of the most talked about exhibits, was not alone in bringing South Korea's tumultuous path to democracy full circle.</p> <p>Among the guests was Park Geun-hye, whose father, Park Chung-hee ruled the country with an iron fist for 18 years until his assassination in October 1979. Ms Park, who acted as first lady after her mother was killed by a North Korean sympathiser in 1974, is hoping to become South Korea's first female president in December.</p> <p>Her father had been dead for half a year when the Gwangju uprising began, but many blame his successor Chun Doo-hwan's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Republic_of_South_Korea\" title=\"\">adherence to <em>yushin</em></a> \u2013 Park's attempt to legitimise military rule \u2013 for the brutality of the military's reaction to demonstrations calling for an end to martial law.</p> <p>After more than a week of violence beginning on 18 May, at least 150 people had been killed and another 3,000 injured. Relatives of the missing claim soldiers threw hundreds of other bodies into mass graves or lakes. Other demonstrators and their sympathisers were rounded up, interrogated and tortured.</p> <p>Initially dismissed by the regime as a communist-inspired riot, the Gwangju uprising spawned similar movements that culminated in 1987 in South Korea's first directly elected president since 1960. As Kim Young Sam, the country's first civilian leader, said in 1993: \"The bloodshed in Gwangju in May 1980 is the cornerstone of this country's democracy. Its victims gave their lives for democracy.\"</p> <p>Park Geun-hye was given an enthusiastic reception by the audience at the biennale opening this month, but the president of the Gwangju Biennale Foundation, Yongwoo Lee, voiced mixed feelings about her hastily arranged campaign stop.</p> <p>\"The public didn't warmly welcome her; they understood she was an unexpected guest,\" says Lee, who was a newspaper reporter at the time of the massacre. He witnessed the violence, but his stories were censored under martial law, and he was later fired and placed on the regime's blacklist.</p> <p>\"When Park's office told me she might come, I said nothing. I didn't welcome her, but I didn't oppose her visit either. I have to be diplomatic. I suppose we like to think of the biennale as a place where even politicians can appreciate art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396687999\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/24/1348502532490/Michael-Joo-s-Indivisible-001.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Joo\u2019s Indivisible at Gwangju Biennale\" width=\"200\" height=\"270\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Michael Joo\u2019s Indivisible, clay reproductions of his personal effects and objects from his past are suspended from a roof of plastic police riot shields.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"From the very start, the Gwangju Biennale has been driven by the spirit of resistance and the Gwangju citizens. When we founded it 14 years ago, we stated that the spirit of the civil uprising was essential. It comes to the first page.\"</p> <p>Twenty-five years of democracy have helped South Korea become an east Asian economic powerhouse. Its <em>chaebol</em> conglomerates, such as Hyundai and Samsung, are instantly recognised around the world; its \"soft power\" - TV dramas, films, food, music and even cosmetics - have won over millions of consumers across the region.</p> <p>Yet there is growing concern that some of the gains of the democracy movement have been lost during five years of conservative rule by the current president, Lee Myung-bak. Amnesty International is among those who claim, for instance, that Lee has abused the national security act, intended to root out North Korean infiltration, to quell legitimate opposition at home.</p> <p>Ahn, one of five people connected to the massacre whose images form part of an installation at the biennale, set up May Mothers House in 1996 after visiting Argentina to meet the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothers_of_the_Plaza_de_Mayo\" title=\"\">mothers of the Plaza de Mayo</a>.</p> <p>Her group holds regular meetings for about 70 women whose children were killed in May 1980, or who were themselves injured or interrogated.</p> <p>Im Kun-tan's son, Kim Gyeong-cheol, became the first official fatality of the uprising after being attacked by soldiers as he returned from a work lunch on 18 May. He was 29.</p> <p>\"He had been beaten like a dog and his eyes has been gouged out,\" says Im, 89. \"He was naked and covered in just a white sheet when I first saw him at the military hospital mortuary. When I returned with some clothes, I caught sight of a guard hosing down the corpses while another recorded their names.\"</p> <p>Like many of the victims' mothers, most of whom are over 65, Im is worried that time will erase memories of the massacre, even though 18 May is now a public holiday in South Korea.</p> <p>\"I am just thankful that I have somewhere like this to come,\" she says of May Mothers House. \"When I close my eyes I no longer feel the torment of the past.

  "<p>More than six years after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/13/trafigura-ivory-coast-documents-toxic-waste\" title=\"\">the dumping of large quantities of toxic waste in the Ivory Coast</a>, there is still nothing to stop a similar disaster in developing countries because politicians and courts have failed to learn from the lessons, a new report has found.</p> <p>In 2009, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/17/trafigura-minton-report-revealed\" title=\"\">Guardian fought a landmark legal battle to reveal the links from Trafigura, a multinational oil trader, to the dumping of tonnes of toxic waste</a> in the African nation three years earlier, causing a public health crisis that affected more than 100,000 people. Effects included breathing difficulties, nausea, stinging eyes and burning skin.</p> <p>But such devastating dumping could easily be perpetrated again in developing countries, according to a three-year investigation into the incident by Amnesty International and Greenpeace. Their report, published on Tuesday, has concluded that too little has been done to strengthen national and international regulations, even after the scale of the toxic dumping became clear.</p> <p>\"This experience shows that a company can put a country into a medical crisis through toxic waste dumping, and still get away with it,\" said Marietta Harjono, campaigner at Greenpeace. \"This is a failure on every level. That is why we are very worried that it could happen again.\"</p> <p>Trafigura has argued that it was not responsible for the dumping of toxic waste by the Probo Koala. It was onboard this ship that a partially-refined fuel was subjected to \"caustic washing\" treatment and turned it into foul-smelling toxic sludge. The 229-page report, entitled The Toxic Truth, disputes this claim and argues that the company's account \"lacks credibility\".</p> <p>Trafigura sent the Guardian a copy of <a href=\"http://www.trafigura.com/our_news.aspx\" title=\"\">a one-and-a-half page letter</a> the company had written to Amnesty and Greenpeace. It said: \"We believe the report contains significant inaccuracies and misrepresentations. The report oversimplifies difficult legal issues, analyses them on ill-founded assumptions and draws selective conclusions which do not adequately reflect the complexity of the situation and the legal processes. Courts in five jurisdictions have reviewed different aspects of the incident, and decisions and settlements have been made. It is simply wrong to suggest that the issues have not had the right judicial scrutiny.\"</p> <p>Trafigura refused to say, after repeated requests, which parts of the report it found inaccurate, misrepresented or ill-founded, or which legal issues had been simplified.</p> <p>The NGOs that wrote the report called for Trafigura to face a criminal trial in the UK. Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said: \"It's time that Trafigura was made to face full legal accountability for what happened. People in Abidjan were failed not just by their own government but by governments in Europe who did not enforce their own laws. Victims are still waiting for justice and there are no guarantees that this kind of corporate crime will not happen again.\"</p> <p>In its letter, Trafigura said: \"Trafigura deeply regrets the impact the Probo Koala incident had \u2013 both real and perceived \u2013 and we have sought to assist the people affected through the variety of the settlements that have been made. It is regrettable \u2013 but entirely outside our control \u2013 that the funding made available appears not to have benefited those people, nor reached the projects intended.\"</p> <p>The report has been presented to the United Nations. Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said: \"We will study this very detailed report into a human tragedy that occurred in a fragile country that should never have happened and must never be repeated \u2013 in Cote d'Ivoire or elsewhere.\"</p> <p>He said the toxic waste dumping underline \"the urgency of strengthening the UN treaties covering shipping and hazardous wastes, specifically the Basel convention\", and called for countries to bring into force the amendment to the convention that would prohibit the export of toxic waste from developed to developing countries.</p> <p>The multibillion pound company has had to pay an estimated \u00a3300m in legal and reparation costs over the last five years as a result of the incidents. But the report found that, despite the legal precedents that the Guardian's investigations gave rise to, there was still no agreed international process for preventing and dealing with toxic dumping activities.</p> <p>There have also been indications that the authorities in the Ivory Coast have failed to redistribute compensation to the victims of the dumping.</p> <p>Greenpeace and Amnesty are calling for freedom from toxic waste dumping to be a human right, which would allow victims of large and smaller-scale dumping to seek legal redress more easily, in national and international courts. Revisions to the Basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal are now under fresh discussion but face opposition.</p> <p>The Toxic Truth report also found that it was relatively easy for companies to sidestep regulations on toxic waste movements.</p> <p>The row over Trafigura's links to the toxic dumping in the Ivory Coast was a test case for the new \"superinjunctions\" that started to appear in the UK in the 2000s, and which allowed companies and individuals to prevent the publication not just of the substance of allegations involving them, but even of the existence of such allegations. Such wide-ranging gagging orders had rarely been granted in UK law, but quickly became widely used by celebrities and companies.</p> <p>In the instance of Trafigura, the result was that the Guardian could not report on the contents of an initial report in the aftermath of the dumping, commissioned by Trafigura.</p> <p>In 2009, it appeared the terms of the superjunction were even wide enough to prevent the Guardian from reporting on a House of Commons debate on Trafigura \u2013 an unprecedented restriction, because for centuries all parliamentary proceedings had been covered by the convention of \"privilege\", which meant that debates and questions in the Houses of Parliament were entitled to be heard by the people.</p> <p>Outcry over that extraordinary restriction, and the fact that the information was swiftly available on the internet, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/13/guardian-gagged-parliamentary-question\" title=\"\">eventually led to the lifting of the Trafigura superinjunction</a>, but has not prevented the increasingly widespread use of such legal instruments by companies, celebrities and others.</p> <p>Tuesday's report found that Trafigura had not been held to account for its dumping under UK jurisdiction, although the authors allege there is strong reason to believe that key decisions made by the company over activities such as \"caustic washing\" were made in its UK-based employees. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/23/trafigura-dutch-fine-waste-export\" title=\"\">Trafigura has been convicted of illegally exporting waste in the Netherlands</a>, where it is headquartered, but the Dutch courts decided that much of the substance of the allegations was beyond their jurisdiction. Trafigura was granted substantive immunity from prosecution in Cote d'Ivoire, as part of a local settlement.</p> <p>This sort of wrangling over legal jurisdiction was condemned as \"opportunistic\" by Greenpeace's Harjono. She said strengthening the Basel regulations would prevent companies being able to benefit from playing off one jurisdiction against another.</p> <p>The chain of events leading to the dumping was that in late 2005 large amounts of coker naptha, an unrefined fuel, were bought by Trafigura and subjected to a process called caustic washing on board the Probo Koala, resulting in the creation of tonnes of hazardous waste. In July 2006, the ship attempted to unload this in the Netherlands but was told it would be costly. The waste was then taken to Abidjan in Cote d'Ivoire, where it was dumped. The next year, Trafigura entered an agreement with the country's governments to pay nearly $200m in return for immunity from prosecution. A report, entitled <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/10/16/mintonreport.pdf\" title=\"\">the Minton report</a>, on the incident was obtained by the Guardian, which was prevented from publishing it by Trafigura's legal representatives, the Carter-Ruck law firm.</p>",

The issue at a glance</h2> <p>The justice and security bill's most controversial element is the extension of secret courts, known as closed material procedures (CMPs), into the civil courts in England and Wales. Opponents believe the powers will enable ministers, rather than judges, to manipulate the way evidence is withheld or presented in the courts \u2013 depriving claimants of a fair trial. The government claims the reform will enable judges to hear a greater range of national security cases. The bill also alters parliamentary scrutiny of the intelligence services.</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>2. The legal origins</h2> <p>In May 2010, the government was forced to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/04/government-secret-evidence-guantanamo-torture1\" title=\"\">pay out millions of pounds in compensation to Binyam Mohamed</a> and other former Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404886150\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347364677660/Binyam-Mohamed-005.jpg\" alt=\"Binyam Mohamed\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Binyam Mohamed, the UK resident secretly rendered to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, whose case sparked the row over intelligence disclosed in court.

Rather than reveal \"sensitive\" intelligence, the government settled out of court claims for wrongful imprisonment and complicity in torture.</p> <p>The result, according to <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm81/8194/8194.pdf\" title=\"\">the former justice secretary Ken Clarke</a>, has been a \"UK justice system unable to pass judgment on these vital matters\". Claimants, he argues, are denied any judicial findings while the intelligence agencies cannot clear their names. The government says the justice and security bill is designed to ensure such a predicament never recurs by extending the use of secret courts while preserving intelligence-sharing with the US and other allies.</p> <p>Without transparent justice, critics counter, abuses of power will remain hidden.</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>3. Why are secret trials in the news?</h2> <p>The legislation, introduced in the House of Lords, has provoked deep anxiety among civil liberties groups,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/mar/05/secrets-scrutiny-green-paper-justice\" title=\"\"> senior lawyers </a>and politicians who fear it is the thin end of a wedge, overturning long-established, common law precedents about fair and open justice. The Labour party supports some elements but <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/54266/sadiq_khan_secret_hearings_undermine_credibility_of_our_entire_legal_system.html\" title=\"\">argues that the secret court developments are \"too widely drawn\" </a>and create \"damaging mistrust and a dangerous gulf between government and the citizens it is purporting to protect\".</p> <p>The bill is also sharpening <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/sep/13/secret-courts-bill-liberal-democrats\" title=\"\">divisions between Liberal Democrats and Conservatives </a>within the coalition. The prime minister, David Cameron, justified secret hearings on the grounds that \"... it isn't currently possible to use intelligence information in a court of law without sometimes endangering national security\".</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>4. A short history of secret hearings</h2> <p>Closed, or \"in camera\", hearings are not unprecedented. Cases in the family division of the high court relating to child custody and divorce issues are regularly held in private.</p> <p>Public interest immunity (PII) certificates date back to the mid-20th century and empower courts to make an order, usually at the request of the government, preventing disclosure of secrets if their release is deemed damaging to the public interest. Neither side in such cases can rely on the withheld information.</p> <p>So-called \"closed material procedures\" (CMPs) go one stage further, enabling authorities to introduce sensitive information in a trial that can only be seen by the judge and security-cleared \"special advocates\" who represent the interest of an individual claimant. The special advocate may not give his or her client precise details of the evidence and can only provide a \"gist\" or loose summary. The claimant may not therefore be aware of all the allegations being made. Critics say this results in parties to a legal dispute no longer being on an equal footing, tilting the advantage in the government's favour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404886151\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/10/1320941804650/Royal-British-Legion-Popp-003.jpg\" alt=\"Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Royal British Legion and Nick Clegg pressured the government to exempt coroners' courts from the bill.

First, the judge can make a decision only if the secretary of state makes an application and has no other jurisdiction to consider it. Secondly, when the judge does come to consider it, it is not for him to weigh up the relative merits of PII or CMP, or to decide what the fairest way would be to decide the case.

He comes down on the side of extending closed material procedures. \"The puritans in this debate demand that 'open justice' must be protected, whatever the cost to the public and to the intelligence needs of our country,\" he wrote this summer. \"Subject to some fine tuning, the government is on the right track with a responsible piece of legislation \u2026 It should not be forgotten that claimants themselves have consented to closed hearings, realising that they were the only way in which their concerns would be properly scrutinised \u2013 one reason why I believe the government should ensure that both parties in a case can apply for a CMP.\"</p> <p>The current independent reviewer, David Anderson QC, believes the proposals <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jun/19/secret-court-genuine-problem-disproportionate\" title=\"\">would be \"tolerable\" as a last resort</a>. He said there is \"a small but indeterminate category of national security-related claims, both for judicial review of executive decisions and for civil damages, in respect of which it is preferable that the option of a CMP \u2013 for all its inadequacies \u2013 should exist.\" </p> <p><strong>Intelligence services will become more accountable</strong> <br>The security services, who have lobbied for and publicly supported the bill, insist that nothing currently revealed will be hidden in future.

This means that such material cannot in practice go into court at all. This situation is bad for us, bad for the other party to proceedings and bad for the administration of justice.</p> <p>\"... No material that is currently considered in public will be made secret under the new arrangements and the effect will be that more, rather than less, material will go before the courts. But the sensitive material will be protected.

When other countries share material with us, they want to know that we will protect it. It still belongs to them and is controlled by them: it is not ours to do with as we wish. This 'control principle' is sacrosanct and we must not break it.

What will disappear behind closed courtroom doors? </h2> <p>Critics of the bill fear that a host of security scandals unearthed with the help of court challenges, including allegations of torture and secret rendition, would never have been exposed under the bill's proposed system of closed material procedures. Even fundamental personal rights such as freedom from imprisonment, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jul/13/secret-court-habeas-corpus-reprieve\" title=\"\">guaranteed by the ancient writ of habeas corpus, might be compromised by the new regime,</a> peers have suggested. The fact that a court could sit in secret without giving notice to the public or the media of a forthcoming hearing has drawn <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/aug/19/secret-court-hearing-compared-superinjunctions?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">comparisons with the excesses of privacy superinjunctions</a>. The government dismisses such claims as alarmist.</p> <p>While the government claims that the proposals are intended to protect the control principle that covers intelligence provided by foreign governments, the material sought in the Guant\u00e1namo case were mostly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/interactive/2010/jul/14/toture-files-key-passages?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">internal British government communications</a>, and their disclosure caused grave embarrassment.

The government insists such measures will only be used in a very limited number of cases and that courts, including Strasbourg, have found that CMPs are capable of delivering fair trials. </p> <p><strong>Have UK courts ever exposed US military secrets?</strong> <br>No examples have ever been given of past \"betrayals\" of confidential intelligence material obtained from allies.

  "<p>The CIA's programme of \"targeted\" drone killings in Pakistan's tribal heartlands is politically counterproductive, kills large numbers of civilians and undermines respect for international law, according to <a href=\"http://livingunderdrones.org\">a report by US academics</a>.</p> <p>The study by Stanford and New York universities' law schools, based on interviews with victims, witnesses and experts, blames the US president, Barack Obama, for the escalation of \"signature strikes\" in which groups are selected merely through remote \"pattern of life\" analysis.</p> <p>Families are afraid to attend weddings or funerals, it says, in case US ground operators guiding drones misinterpret them as gatherings of Taliban or al-Qaida militants.</p> <p>\"The dominant narrative about the use of drones in Pakistan is of a surgically precise and effective tool that makes the US safer by enabling 'targeted killings' of terrorists, with minimal downsides or collateral impacts. This narrative is false,\" the report, entitled Living Under Drones, states.</p> <p>The authors admit it is difficult to obtain accurate data on casualties \"because of US efforts to shield the drone programme from democratic accountability, compounded by obstacles to independent investigation of strikes in North Waziristan\".</p> <p>The \"best available information\", they say, is that between 2,562 and 3,325 people have been killed in Pakistan between June 2004 and mid-September this year \u2013 of whom between 474 and 881 were civilians, including 176 children. The figures have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/aug/02/us-drone-strikes-data\" title=\"\">assembled by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, which estimated that a further 1,300 individuals were injured in drone strikes over that period.</p> <p>The report was commissioned by and written with the help of <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/cases/2012_03_28_noor_khan/\" title=\"\">the London-based Reprieve organisation, which is supporting action in the British courts by Noor Khan</a>, a Pakistani whose father was killed by a US drone strike in March 2011. His legal challenge alleges the UK is complicit in US drone strikes because GCHQ, the eavesdropping agency, shares intelligence with the CIA on targets for drone strikes.</p> <p>\"US drones hover 24 hours a day over communities in north-west Pakistan, striking homes, vehicles, and public spaces without warning,\" the American law schools report says.</p> <p>\"Their presence terrorises men, women, and children, giving rise to anxiety and psychological trauma among civilian communities. Those living under drones have to face the constant worry that a deadly strike may be fired at any moment, and the knowledge that they are powerless to protect themselves.</p> <p>\"These fears have affected behaviour. The US practice of striking one area multiple times, and evidence that it has killed rescuers, makes both community members and humanitarian workers afraid or unwilling to assist injured victims.\"</p> <p>The study goes on to say: \"Publicly available evidence that the strikes have made the US safer overall is ambiguous at best \u2026 The number of 'high-level' militants killed as a percentage of total casualties is extremely low \u2013 estimated at just 2% [of deaths]. Evidence suggests that US strikes have facilitated recruitment to violent non-state armed groups, and motivated further violent attacks \u2026 One major study shows that 74% of Pakistanis now consider the US an enemy.\"</p> <p>Coming from American lawyers rather than overseas human rights groups, the criticisms are likely to be more influential in US domestic debates over the legality of drone warfare.</p> <p>\"US targeted killings and drone strike practices undermine respect for the rule of law and international legal protections and may set dangerous precedents,\" the report says, questioning whether Pakistan has given consent for the attacks.</p> <p>\"The US government's failure to ensure basic transparency and accountability in its targeted killings policies, to provide details about its targeted killing programme, or adequately to set out the legal factors involved in decisions to strike hinders necessary democratic debate about a key aspect of US foreign and national security policy.</p> <p>\"US practices may also facilitate recourse to lethal force around the globe by establishing dangerous precedents for other governments. As drone manufacturers and officials successfully reduce export control barriers, and as more countries develop lethal drone technologies, these risks increase.\"</p> <p>The report supports <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/21/drone-strikes-international-law-un\" title=\"\">the call by Ben Emmerson QC, the UN's special rapporteur on countering terrorism, for independent investigations </a>into deaths from drone strikes and demands the release of the US department of justice memorandums outlining the legal basis for US targeted killings in Pakistan.</p> <p>The report highlights the switch from the former president George W Bush's practice of targeting high-profile al-Qaida personalities to the reliance, under Obama's administration, of analysing patterns of life on the ground to select targets.</p> <p>\"According to US authorities, these strikes target 'groups of men who bear certain signatures, or defining characteristics associated with terrorist activity, but whose identities aren't known',\" the report says. \"Just what those 'defining characteristics' are has never been made public.\" People in North Waziristan are now afraid to attend funerals or other gatherings, it suggests.</p> <p>Fears that US agents pay informers to attach electronic tags to the homes of suspected militants in Pakistan haunt the tribal districts, according to the study. \"[In] Waziristan \u2026 residents are gripped by rumours that paid CIA informants have been planting tiny silicon-chip homing devices that draw the drones.</p> <p>\"Many of the Waziris interviewed spoke of a constant fear of being tagged with a chip by a neighbour or someone else who works for either Pakistan or the US, and of the fear of being falsely accused of spying by local Taliban.\"</p> <p>Reprieve's director, Clive Stafford Smith, said: \"An entire region is being terrorised by the constant threat of death from the skies. Their way of life is collapsing: kids are too terrified to go to school, adults are afraid to attend weddings, funerals, business meetings, or anything that involves gathering in groups.</p> <p>\"George Bush wanted to create a global 'war on terror' without borders, but it has taken Obama's drone war to achieve his dream.\"</p>",
  "<p>Living Under Drones, a new report from Stanford and New York universities, was a difficult piece of fieldwork \u2013 I was with the law students in Peshawar as they tried to interview victims of the CIA's drone war. But it has made an important contribution to the drone debate by identifying the innocent victims of the CIA's reign of terror: the entire civilian population of Waziristan (roughly 800,000 people).</p> <p>Until now, the most heated dispute has revolved around how many drone victims in the Pakistan border region are dangerous extremists, and how many children, women or men with no connection to any terrorist group. I have been to the region, and have a strong opinion on this point \u2013 but until the area is opened up to media inspection, or the CIA releases the tapes of each <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-114_Hellfire\" title=\"\">hellfire missile</a> strike, the controversy will rage on.</p> <p>However, there can be no sensible disagreement over certain salient facts: first, the US now has more than 10,000 weaponised drones in its arsenal; second, as many as six <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/drone-warfare-deadly-civilian-toll\" title=\"\">Predator drones</a> circle over one location at any given time, often for 24 hours a day, with high-resolution cameras snooping on the movements of everyone below; third, the Predators emit an eerie sound, earning them the name <em>bangana</em> (buzzing wasp) in Pashtu; fourth, everyone in the area can see them, 5,000ft up, all day \u2013 and hear them all night long; fifth, nobody knows when the missile will come, and turn each member of the family into what the CIA calls a \"bugsplat\". The Predator operator, thousands of miles away in Nevada, often pushes the button over a cup of coffee in the darkest hours of the Waziristan night, between midnight and 5am. So a parent putting children to bed cannot be sure they will wake up safely.</p> <p>Every Waziri town has been terrorised. We may learn this from the eyewitness accounts in Living Under Drones, or surmise it from the exponential increase in the distribution of anti-anxiety and anti-depression medication across the region.</p> <p>Sometimes it is difficult for those comfortably ensconced in the west to understand. But for me, it brings to mind my mother, Jean Stafford Smith. In 1944 she was 17. She had left the safety of her school (she had been evacuated to the countryside) to do a secretarial course in London. Each evening she took the bus home from Grosvenor Place, behind Buckingham Palace, to her digs off Tottenham Court Road. Back then, darkness would truly descend on the city, as the blackout was near total.</p> <p>Sixty-eight years on, my mother retains vivid memories of the gathering gloom. One night a week, she climbed the tower of a local church to spot for the fires that might spread from an explosion. When the doodlebugs (as V1s \u2013 Hitler's drones \u2013 were called) came over, she knew that she was safe so long as she could hear the engine. She knew, too, that the drones were indiscriminate killers, and that only when they fell silent did she have to worry where they might fall. Some of the engines apparently cut in and out, like the oscillating buzz of a chainsaw, heartstopping for the potential victims below.</p> <p>In 1944, two doodlebugs hit the environs of Buckingham Palace, near where my mother learned shorthand. One landed on the palace wall, and blew out the secretarial school's windows. A second<a href=\"http://www.flyingbombsandrockets.com/V1_maintxtc.html\" title=\"\"> killed more than 100 people who had, until moments before, been singing hymns in the Guards Chapel</a> on Birdcage Walk. It was a weekend, so my mother was back at her digs.</p> <p>My mother, an eternal optimist, never really thought she was going to die, even when \u2013 on 30 June 1944 \u2013 a drone struck Tottenham Court Road. Perhaps reminiscent of the tragedy of 7/7, a witness described \"a bus, still packed with people sitting in all the seats, but all the glass blown out and all the skin blown off their faces\".</p> <p>Many suffered far more than my mother, both in London and beyond. Indeed, they say that fear for those you love can be more devastating than facing danger yourself: my grandmother Vera, a formidable woman who had learned to trap rabbits in the Great Depression to keep food on the family table, lived 60 miles north of London near Ely, and worried constantly about her youngest daughter. The ripples of anxiety spread wide.</p> <p>So little changes. Current RAF doctrine tells us, euphemistically, how \"the psychological impact of air power, from the presence of a UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] to the noise generated by an approaching attack helicopter, has often proved to be extremely effective in exerting influence \u2026\" Perhaps they mean \"terror\", as described by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/21/new-york-times-reporter-taliban\" title=\"\">David Rohde</a>, a former New York Times journalist kidnapped and held by the Taliban for months in Waziristan. Rohde, quoted in Living Under Drones, describes the fear the drones inspired in ordinary civilians: \"The drones were terrifying. From the ground, it is impossible to determine who or what they are tracking as they circle overhead. The buzz of a distant propeller is a constant reminder of imminent death.\"</p> <p>I hope that this report reminds us all what the US \u2013 with British support \u2013 is doing to the people of Pakistan. Maybe then there will be less surprise at the hatred the drone war is engendering in the Islamic world \u2013 and a chance that we will reconsider what we are doing.</p>"
