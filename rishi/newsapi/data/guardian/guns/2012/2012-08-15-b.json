  "<p>Britain has told the Ecuadorean authorities it believes officials can enter its embassy in London and arrest Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, according to Ecuador's minister for foreign affairs, Ricardo Patino.</p> <p>The development came two months after Assange walked into the embassy in a bid to avoid being extradited to Sweden where he faces allegations of sexual assault.</p> <p>At a news conference on Wednesday, Patino said Ecuador would announce its decision regarding Assange's asylum request at 7am (noon GMT) on Thursday.</p> <p>Patino also released details of a letter he said was delivered through a British embassy official in Quito, the capital of Ecuador.</p> <p>The letter said: \"You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the Embassy.\"</p> <p>The letter added: \"We need to reiterate that we consider the continued use of the diplomatic premises in this way incompatible with the Vienna Convention and unsustainable and we have made clear the serious implications that this has for our diplomatic relations.\"</p> <p>An Ecuadorean government spokesman said: \"We are deeply shocked by the British government's threats against the sovereignty of the Ecuadorean embassy and their suggestion that they may forcibly enter the embassy.</p> <p>\"This a clear breach of international law and the protocols set out in the Vienna Convention.</p> <p>\"Throughout out the last 56 days Mr Julian Assange has been in the Embassy, the Ecuadorean government has acted honourably in all our attempts to seek a resolution to the situation.</p> <p>\"This stands in stark contrast to the escalation of the British government today with their threats to break down the door of the Ecuadorean embassy.</p> <p>\"Instead of threatening violence against the Ecuadorean embassy, the British government should use its energy to find a peaceful resolution to this situation which we are aiming to achieve.\"</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"We have consistently made our position clear in our discussions with the government of Ecuador.</p> <p>\"The UK has a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences and we remain determined to fulfil this obligation.</p> <p>\"We have an obligation to extradite Mr Assange and it is only right that we give Ecuador the full picture.</p> <p>\"Throughout this process we have drawn the Ecuadoreans' attention to relevant provisions of our law, whether, for example, the extensive human rights safeguards in our extradition procedures, or the legal status of diplomatic premises in the UK.</p> <p>\"We are still committed to reaching a mutually acceptable solution.\"</p> <p>Assange denies the allegations against him, but fears he will be sent to the United States if he goes to Sweden.</p> <p>An offer to the Swedish authorities by Ecuador for investigators to interview Assange inside the London embassy was rejected.</p>",
  "<p>Leading Australian politicians and former defence chiefs are demanding an independent investigation, along the lines of the Chilcot inquiry in Britain, into their country's role in the invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>They say an independent inquiry must investigate the circumstances that led the then National-Liberal coalition to participate in the US-led invasion in 2003 in which Australia contributed 2,000 troops, including special forces. It must also conduct a review of the war powers of the government, and draw lessons for the future.</p> <p>Demands for an inquiry are led by former Liberal prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, former defence secretary, Paul Barratt, and former chief of the Australian Defence Force, General Peter Gration.</p> <p>In a foreword to the publication \"Why did we go to war in Iraq? A call for an Australian inquiry\", which says Australia was exposed to the accusation of waging an illegal war, Fraser writes that an inquiry would not rake over old coals but rather \"develop a better understanding of how warfare decisions are reached and to strengthen the governmental structures against precipitous or ill-considered actions in future.\"</p> <p>The call for an inquiry is also supported by a statement signed by 30 leading academics in politics and law, retired senior diplomats and experts in the field of war and conflict.</p> <p>\"In retrospect\", Fraser writes, \"what we now see were frantic efforts to create the prerequisites by manipulating intelligence assessments to fit the case, with all the sophistication that task required. The general public had become confused as to whether the weapons of mass destruction allegedly being developed or held by Saddam Hussein existed and were being placed in a state of readiness to justify both 'national interest' and 'self-defence' claims.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"In all this, the Australian government may have thought it had no choice if it were to retain the confidence of the US. But was this a misjudgement? [...] Did the government really think through the issues independently and the implications for our standing with Asian neighbours? Did it really evaluate the intelligence presented to it and ignore its flaws? Did it want to? Did it really consider the legal issues surrounding the proposed invasion objectively, or was it not really interested?\"</p> <p>The Australian parliament's role in war is merely \"ex post facto, to approve actions already taken under the prerogative at a stage where the denial of finance would in effect betray the armed forces\", say those calling for an inquiry.</p> <p>They note that the justifications given by US and British leaders for the invasion, which Australia accepted, \"were later shown to be based on false information, on which Australia apparently relied\".</p>",

  "<p>Universities should embrace the government's market reforms of higher education by competing with each other for undergraduates, David Willetts says today.</p> <p>The universities minister also says he expects some universities to shrink if student demand falls.</p> <p>Many more candidates should get their first choice of university this year as government reforms take effect, Willetts says. Under coalition reforms, English universities can recruit unlimited numbers of students who achieve grades AAB or above, changing a system in which each institution has a fixed number of state-funded places every year.</p> <p>Before publication of A-level results for 335,000 candidates in England, Northern Ireland and Wales, the minister urges institutions to take advantage of the new system. In an article for the Guardian, Willetts says: \"My conversations with vice-chancellors suggest universities are responding imaginatively to this liberation, so many more applicants should be able to attend their first-choice university. I recognise universities do not have rubber walls that allow endless expansion but we do expect them to start growing \u2013 and perhaps contracting \u2013 in line with demand.\"</p> <p>Undergraduates deserve a \"world-class education\" in exchange for higher fees, the minister says. Institutions in England can charge up to \u00a39,000 a year for the first time from this autumn.</p> <p>Underlining financial pressures on universities, Willetts says: \"Now that the main funding for degrees flows via students there are sharper incentives to deliver an excellent student experience.\"</p> <p>The partial lifting of the student quota system - known as number control - will affect 85,000 candidates this year. However, it may have a limited impact on the most selective universities, which have little space or incentive for expansion. Oxford and Cambridge have ruled out expanding. Among Russell Group universities, Bristol plans a significant expansion \u2013 admitting an additional 600 UK undergraduates this year \u2013 while UCL intends to add another 300. Next year the relaxation of number control will be more far-reaching - it is being extended to students achieving grades of ABB or higher, affecting one in three entrants or around 120,000 people.</p> <p>Figures published in March indicated a \"squeezed middle\" of English universities might suffer sharp falls in student numbers this autumn. The <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/data/year/2012/201208/\" title=\"\">estimate</a> identified a band of 34 universities which neither attract the best-performing students nor offer the lowest fees, including Bedfordshire, the University of Central Lancashire, Leeds Met and Sheffield Hallam.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6219\" title=\"\">The Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>, which describes the new student finance system as \"substantially more progressive\", says its research shows that the poorest 30% of graduates, in terms of life-time earnings, will be better-off under the new regime. The richest 15% of graduates will pay back more than they borrow.</p> <p>However, there is concern about a decline in applications. The lifting of the fees cap has led to a \"clear drop\" in the number of English students applying for university places this autumn, an independent analysis has found.</p> <p>There are 15,000 \"missing\" applicants who might have been expected to have sought a place on a degree course this academic year but did not, according to the Independent Commission on Fees.</p> <p>Teenagers who miss out on a place at university have been encouraged by an employers' organisation to get work experience in their year off.</p> <p>Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR), which represents over 800 firms, said a degree was a \"significant asset\" but it was not the sole route to a successful career.</p> <p>\"Those who take a year out ought also to seize the opportunity to gain experience of the workplace in order to add to their next university application, and to help them to begin preparing for career decisions after university,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Taking a year out before going on to university will not weaken future job applications, providing that you are able to demonstrate what you have gained during the year.\"</p>",
  "<p>England's first match since Euro 2012 did not quite amount to a brave new world but they can at least reflect on a satisfying evening's work. Their debutants should be better for the experience and Roy Hodgson's team, experimenting with a new formation, are entitled to enjoy beating the nation that had outplayed them in the Euro 2012 quarter-final.</p> <p>This was a far more gentle workout against what was, in essence, an Italy B team, but England recovered well once Daniele de Rossi's goal, after a quarter of an hour, had threatened another ordeal. Phil Jagielka equalised after 27 minutes, emulating De Rossi with a header straight from a corner, and England won the match with a wonderful strike from Jermain Defoe, one of their six substitutes.</p> <p>Another, Ryan Bertrand, had stopped England from going behind with a goal-line clearance only seconds before and this was a good night for the players winning their first caps. Tom Cleverley coped ably after going straight into the starting line-up, and Jack Butland is now the youngest goalkeeper in England's history, beating a record that had lasted 124 years. Butland started the match, suggesting he is now officially Joe Hart's understudy, before John Ruddy replaced him at the interval. Within 10 minutes, Ruddy had made the outstanding save of the match, in a second half also notable for Jake Livermore's debut.</p> <p>An international friendly three days before the start of the new Premier League season is never going to be remembered with any great fondness, particularly one that is staged in a two-thirds empty stadium in Switzerland. But there was certainly more good than bad, even if it is still a work in progress. If nothing else, it is encouraging that Hodgson is willing to move away from the 4-4-2 formation that he favoured in Euro 2012 and that has been the cornerstone for most of his managerial career.</p> <p>England have taken their time catching up with most of the successful teams in Europe and the 4-2-3-1 system has brought them their first victory over Italy in 15 years. Hodgson started with Frank Lampard and Michael Carrick as deep-lying midfielders, collecting the ball from the defence and setting the tempo.</p> <p>Cleverley was in a more advanced position, with Ashley Young and Adam Johnson coming in from wide positions to support Andy Carroll as the spearhead of attack. Carroll had a disappointing 45 minutes before his withdrawal at half-time and James Milner, a substitute, was more penetrative in wide positions than either Johnson or Young. Yet there were some good performances, too. Lampard's was an impressive riposte for those who have suggested it is a retrograde step to bring the 34-year-old back into the team. Carrick's return ended with him wearing the captain's armband and Defoe was sharp and confident after replacing Carroll, scoring with a peach of a strike.</p> <p>At least this time it was not an object lesson in how to pass the ball, as had been witnessed when these sides met in Kiev seven and a half weeks ago. England, however, had a difficult opening 25 minutes. De Rossi's header was a soft goal to concede, and an unimpressive start from Carrick given that he was the player who was out-jumped in the process.</p> <p>Carrick's return to the team, after a two-year absence, was designed so England could start taking better care of the ball, rather than because of his ability to make clearing headers inside his own penalty area. All the same, it is part of a midfielder's job to do the muck-and-nettles stuff and Carrick, who is taller than De Rossi, will not enjoy the replays of what happened after Alessandro Diamanti's corner.</p> <p>Italy will have similar complaints about Jagielka's goal but the Everton defender deserves a lot of credit for the way he attacked the ball and read the trajectory of Lampard's corner. Jagielka was simply quicker and more decisive than his nearest opponent, Federico Balzaretti, throwing himself at the ball to flash a diving header past Salvatore Sirigu, playing instead of Gianluigi Buffon in Italy's goal.</p> <p>The second half featured more chances, even if there were times when the frequency with which both teams made substitutes interrupted the flow.</p> <p>Italy began well, Ruddy diving to his right to block Mattia Destro's low shot splendidly, followed shortly afterwards by Federico Peluso shooting into the side-netting.</p> <p>For the most part though, it was an evenly contested game played at times with the feel of the pre-season encounter that it was. Carrick looked nice on the ball, as he always does, even if Lampard was more influential. If there was a criticism, it was that England might have carried more threat going forwards if Kyle Walker and Leighton Baines had been more willing to break forward from their full-back positions, as they do for their clubs.</p> <p>Before anyone gets too carried away, it should also be noted this was an Italy side featuring eight debutants, two starting the match and another half a dozen coming on from the bench. England do deserve credit, though, for not letting the game drift to an uneventful conclusion.</p> <p>Shortly before the winning goal, another of the substitutes, Joleon Lescott, bundled Milner's cross against the post from almost point-blank range but could not turn in the rebound. Bertrand then headed out Manolo Gabbiadini's goalbound effort and, moments later, the ball was at Defoe's feet. The striker's turn gave him a yard on the nearest opponent, Ignazio Abate, and his diagonal shot from 25 yards went into the top corner, via Sirigu's fingertips.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Evening all. The line-ups are on the way but as you try to contain your excitement ahead of those revelations, here's Daniel Taylor on why Roy Hodgson needs to look at different formations, new players and ways of developing a fluid passing game. Enjoy.</p> <blockquote> <p><br>All things considered, it is probably for the best that so many of Roy Hodgson's players to face Italy were spared what happened against the same opposition when the teams last met and, for England, the ordeal started even before the penalties that took them out of Euro 2012.</p> <p>Hodgson's squad includes only three players \u2014 Joleon Lescott, Ashley Young and James Milner \u2014 who started against Italy in that quarter-final in Kiev seven weeks ago, when the Azzurri were so much more refined on the ball it barely seems plausible that England are the bookmakers' favourites for the rematch.</p> <p>What happens from now on is the basis on which the Hodgson era will ultimately be judged and, although the first part of his rebuilding may not amount to a revolution, or even come close, there are at least indications that he recognises there is a need for change.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/14/roy-hodgson-england-friendly-italy\"> Click here to read the rest of the article</a>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>7:25pm:</strong> We know Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger don't have much truck with international football but surely they wouldn't conspire to delay <a href=\" http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/terms-agreed-for-van-persie-transfer\">this announcement</a> till just now simply to steal the thunder of tonight's fixtures?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>7.30pm:</strong> Here is the England line-up.

Poland's kit. Their new white jersey/red shirt combo shows the FA's merchandising department is on the ball at least. So far in this match, however, England have not been. Italy have all the possession so far.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> The ground is half full and the match is being played almost at half-pace. And Alberto Aquilani's early passes have made it half-way to their intended target: he keeps giving the ball back to England, who then give it back to Italy.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Baines rumbles forward down the left and wins a corner. Lampard's lofts it into the box and Italy clear. England regain it and work the ball wide to Carroll, who has pulled out to the right for some reason. He swings in a cross to where he could have been, and the relaxed Italian centrebacks play it to safety.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Carroll leaps high to meet a Lampard corner but can't control his header, which hurtles high over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Northern Ireland are now 2-0 up against Finland, while Holland are trailing 1-0 to Belgium and Wales have gone 1-0 down at home to Bosnia. And back in Switzerland (who are leading in Croatia, incidentally), Italy and England are just starting to have graciously gone to play in Croatia tonight so that England and Italy can play in their place) Butland has just been called into serious action for the first time to push a deflected Italian freekick around the post.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Italy 1-0 England (De Rossi 14')</strong> Hodgson won't be happy with that ... and may even feel vindicated at not bringing Michael Carrick to the Euros: he has just allowed himself to be easily outjumped by De Rossi from a corner, and the Italian nodded into the net from six yards.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Things are going south for Northern Ireland: they've conceded two goals in two minutes, allowing Finland to pull it back to 2-2. Meanwhile, Italy have been emboldened by that goal and starting to play with a strut. Destro has just brought a save from Butland with a header following a good move and a decent Diamanti cross.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Germany have just had their keeper, Zieler, sent off ... but Lionel Messi has missed the ensuing penalty! Still 0-0 between Germany and Argentina.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> That was better from England, with Lampard integral to a decent move. He then had a short charged down at the edge of the area but recovered the ball and nudged it sideways to Johnson, who cut inside to send in a reasonable low shot with his left. Keeper saves.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Oh dear. Italy undo England with an elementary ball over the top, which caught Cahill flat-footed. Destro took it down on his chest but then tonked a wild shot over the bar. England are not only technically inferior but tactically naive: players don't appear capable of thinking flexibly during matches.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>25 min: </strong> Is the reason that this match is being played in Switzerland - Fifa's doorstep - to show the governing body up close the folly of ranking England as the third best team in the world?</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Italy 1-1 England (Jagielka 28')</strong> That last barb seems to have spurred England into action! They were helped to by some slack Italian defending from a corner, though that should not detract from Jagielka's feat: he threw himself full-length to meet Lampard's delivery and direct a splendid header into the far corner.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Lampard forces a good save from the keeper with a trademark swirling shot from distance. \"Any news of the Evra love-in against Uruguay?\" wonders Iain Copestake. Well, it's 0-0 and Luis Suarez isn't playing so hasn't had a chance to discuss linguistics with Evra and his team-mates.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> England are improving and starting to piece together decent moves in the Italian half. Meanwhile, Jordan Rhodes has scores for Scotland but Marc Bresciano has scored for Australia. The mathematicians amongst you will have deduced that that means the sides are currently tied at 1-1.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Cleverley has been involved in most of what England have done well in possession, flitting between the lines in a way that gives the side the unpredictability they have often lacked. Lampard has done well too so far. Carroll, however, is having a shocker. His touch and movement have been dreadfully substandard.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> That was odd from Butland, the first sign of fallibility that the youngster has shown in an otherwise accomplished performance so far: he hesitated about coming for an out-swinging cross from the right ... and then lunged at it with feet while doing a star jump. He succeeded only in shunting it out a few yards and was fortunate that no Italian was on hand to punish him.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Good effort from Lampard, curling a 25-yard freekick inches over the bar. That is Clive Tyldsley's cue to give us a quirky stat: England have not scored from a direct freekick for six years (and I know you know who scored that one).</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Slick interplay between Abate and Diamanti concludes with the former lashing the ball across the face of England's goal but again no one is there to prod home.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> The ref sees no point in playing any additional time. Hodgson, meanwhile, has a face like a seething volcano and seems poised to erupt once the players get back to the dressing room.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Chitchat:</strong><br>\"The major takeaway from the game thus far is that Mancini is right to want De Rossi. Maybe he'll get him now United have got Van Persie.\" - Gene Salorio</p> <p>\"I'm in the stand and the only thing England us winning is the noise contest. English end is making the running whereas the Italian crowd completely mute.\" - Simon Haye</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>England substitution: </strong>Carroll has been put out of our misery, in comes Defoe, whose sharpness could prove more complementary to the quite nimble midfield behind him.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Wales are now 2-0 down to Bosnia, while Germany trail by the same score against Argentina. Brazil are beating Sweden 3-0, Holland have come from behind to lead 2-1 against Belgium, and Denmark are losing 3-1 at home to Slovakia. Italy and England, meanwhile, have made a sedate start to the second period.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Ruddy, who came on at half-time for Butland, is called upon for the first time to catch a straightforward Destro shot from 20 yards. Mission accomplished.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> According to ITV's touchline rover, England complained to the ref at half-time about Italian rough-house tactics. They don't have a leg to stand on ... now that Baines has just chopped down the ones that Aquilani was standing on as Italy launched a counter. Again the ref decides against a card.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Smart reflexes and admirable agility from Ruddy to thwart Destro after an incisive move by Italy, with the impressive Diamanti again to the fore.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> If Hodgson did indeed erupt at half-time, he seems to have left his players petrified like the cattle of Pompeii: Italy are playing right through them at the moment, with Destro particularly dangerous. Ruddy, the one lively-looking Englander, has just had to make another two decent saves.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>England substitutions</strong>: Milner and Lescott on, Young and Jagielka off. Switzerland, by the way, are now leading 4-2 in Croatia, adding to the belief of the many people, myself included, who reckon they are a rising European force.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Walker gets forward well for the first time in the game, but his intended cutback for Cleverly is cut out.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Good pressure from England, featuring Lampard and Milner, whose low cross yields a corner. Lampard clips the corner across and Cahill fires it sweetly into the net ... but the whistle had gone for a foul by Lescott.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Jake Livermore has been introduced for Lampard to make his England debut. Italy have replaced Aquilani. Elsewhere, Lukaku has put Belgium 3-2 up against Holland and Di Maria has increased Argentina's lead over Germany to 3-0.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Lescsott does well to nut a cross clear before Gabbiadini could connect. Meanwhile, an own goal by Jason Davidson has given Scotland a 2-1 lead over Australia.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Excitement! And a mighty let-off for Italy! Milner curled in a sumptuous freekick that that perplexed the Italian defence so much that Peluso almost diverted it into his own goal but the keeper reacted brilliantly to claw it out. Cahill then followed up to clatter a shot off the outside of the post from an acute angle.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Baines is becoming more enterprising down the left for England as Italy appear to have suffered more from the raft of substitutions. Somewhere else, another potential rising European force, Belgium, have taken a 4-2 lead over Holland thanks to Tottenham's new centreback, Jan Vertonghen.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> There'll be no more enterprise from Baines tonight: he's just been replaced by Ryan Bertrand, another senior debutant.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Ruddy stands tall to deflect a Destro shot after a ball breaks to the Italian in the box. From the ensuing header Bertrand marks his debut with a superb headed clearance off the line!</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>THAT IS A SUPERB GOAL! italy 1-2 England (Defoe 80')</strong> Moments after Bertrand headed off the line, England broke forward and Milner worked the ball to Defoe at the edge of the box. He swiveled past his marker and cracked an exquisite strike into the top corner. Sirigu got his hands to it but it was to powerful for him to push away.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Bertrand has excelled since coming on. Formidable in defence, he now demonstrates his effectiveness going forward, tearing down the left before picking out Defoe at the edge of the area. The striker attempts to smash another one into the net from distance ... but instead sends a lame effort trickling wide. Meanwhile, Ross McCormack has out Scotland 3-1 up against Australia and Northern Ireland and Finland are entertaining themselves in a 3-3 draw.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Terrible cross by Schelotto straight into the arms of Ruddy. Elsewhere, signalling a brave new dawn under a reformed Giovanni Trapattoni, the Republic of Ireland have ... drawn 0-0 with Serbia.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Fine play by England to release Milner down the right, and the winger tricks his way into the box before playing a smart cut-back to Defoe. Schelotto manages to get a tiny deflection to prevent the shot going into the net. And England squander the corner.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Friendlies are like tea leaves: you can make a fool of yourself if you start trying to read too much into them. But Roy Hodgson can be cautiously pleased with much of what he saw tonight. There were traces of increased niftiness in midfield and promising performances from prospects such as Cleverly, Bertrand and Ruddy, all crowned with a superb winning goal from Defoe. There were negatives too, of course, such as Carroll's unwieldiness and tactical naivete in defence but all in all there were more pros than cons to a match of limited value.</p>",
  "<p>A software engineer in my Facebook community wrote recently about his outrage that when he visited Disneyland, and went on a ride, the theme park offered him the photo of himself and his girlfriend to buy \u2013 with his credit card information already linked to it. He noted that he had never entered his name or information into anything at the theme park, or indicated that he wanted a photo, or alerted the humans at the ride to who he and his girlfriend were \u2013 so, he said, based on his professional experience, the system had to be using facial recognition technology. He had never signed an agreement allowing them to do so, and he declared that this use was illegal. He also claimed that Disney had recently shared data from facial-recognition technology with the United States military.</p> <p>Yes, I know: it sounds like a paranoid rant.</p> <p>Except that it <a href=\"http://occupycorporatism.com/disney-biometrics-and-the-department-of-defense/\">turned out to be true</a>. <a href=\"http://newsinitiative.org/story/2006/08/14/walt_disney_world_the_governments\">News21, supported by the Carnegie and Knight foundations</a>, reports that Disney sites are indeed controlled by face-recognition technology, that the military is interested in the technology, and that the face-recognition contractor, Identix, has contracts with the US government \u2013 for technology that identifies individuals in a crowd.</p> <p>Fast forward: after the Occupy crackdowns, I noted that odd-looking CCTVs had started to appear, attached to lampposts, in public venues in Manhattan where the small but unbowed remnants of Occupy congregated: there was one in Union Square, right in front of their encampment. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/02/mayday-alert-occupy-movement\">I reported here</a> on my experience of witnessing a white van marked \"Indiana Energy\" that was lifting workers up to the lampposts all around Union Square, and installing a type of camera. When I asked the workers what was happening \u2013 and why an Indiana company was dealing with New York City civic infrastructure, which would certainly raise questions \u2013 I was told: \"I'm a contractor. Talk to ConEd.\"</p> <p>I then noticed, some months later, that these bizarre camera/lights had been installed not only all around Union Square but also around Washington Square Park. I posted a photo I took of them, and asked: \"What is this?\" Commentators who had lived in China said that they were the same camera/streetlight combinations that are mounted around public places in China. These are enabled for facial recognition technology, which allows police to watch video that is tagged to individuals, in real time. When too many people congregate, they can be dispersed and intimidated simply by the risk of being identified \u2013 before dissent can coalesce. (Another of my Facebook commentators said that such lamppost cameras had been installed in Michigan, and that they barked \"Obey\", at pedestrians. This, too, sounded highly implausible \u2013 until this week in Richmond, British Columbia, near the Vancouver airport, when I was startled as the lamppost in the intersection started talking to me \u2013 in this case, instructing me on how to cross (as though I were blind or partially sighted).</p> <p>Finally, last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/nypd-microsoft-surveillance-system\">New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly</a> to unveil a major new police surveillance infrastructure, developed by Microsoft. The Domain Awareness System links existing police databases with live video feeds, including cameras using vehicle license plate recognition software. No mention was made of whether the system plans to use \u2013 or already uses \u2013 facial recognition software. But, at present, <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/259470/regulation_of_facial_recognition_may_be_needed_us_senator_says.html\">there is no law to prevent US government and law enforcement agencies from building facial recognition databases</a>.</p> <p>And we know from industry newsletters that the US military, law enforcement, and the department of homeland security are betting heavily on facial recognition technology. <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/240363/facial_recognition_technology_facebook_photo_matching_is_just_the_start.html\">As PC World notes</a>, Facebook itself is a market leader in the technology \u2013 but military and security agencies are close behind.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/topics/biometric-technologies?page=9\">Homeland Security Newswire</a>, billions of dollars are being invested in the development and manufacture of various biometric technologies capable of detecting and identifying anyone, anywhere in the world \u2013 via iris-scanning systems, already in use; foot-scanning technology (really); voice pattern ID software, and so on.</p> <p>What is very obvious is that this technology will not be applied merely to people under arrest, or to people under surveillance in accordance with the fourth amendment (suspects in possible terrorist plots or other potential crimes, <em>after</em> law enforcement agents have already obtained a warrant from a magistrate). No, the \"targets\" here are me and you: everyone, all of the time. In the name of \"national security\", the capacity is being built to identify, track and document any citizen constantly and continuously.</p> <p>The revealing boosterism of a trade magazine like Homeland Security Newswire envisions endless profits for the surveillance industry, in a society where your TV is spying on you, a billboard you drive by recognizes you, Minority Report style, and the FBI knows where to find your tattoo \u2013 before you have committed any crime: \"FBI on Track to Book Faces, Scars, Tattoos\", it notes; \"Billboards, TVs Detect your Faces; Advertisers Salivate\", it gloats; \"Biometric Companies See Government as the Driver of Future Market Growth\", <a href=\"http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/biometric-companies-see-government-driver-future-market-growth\">it announces</a>. Indeed, the article admits without a blush that all the growth is expected to be in government consumption, with \"no real expectation\" of private-sector growth at all. So much for smaller government!</p> <p>To acclimate their populations to this brave new world of invasive surveillance technologies, UK Prime Minister David Cameron and and his Canadian counterpart, Stephen Harper, both <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/05/09/queen_speech_ccdp/\">recently introduced</a> <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2012/06/08/canadas-warrantless-surveill-2.html\">\"snoop\" bills</a>.

  "<p>Moving from Auntie Beeb to the Gray Lady may have a pleasing ring. But that Mark Thompson can swap the director general's chair of the BBC for a Manhattan chief executive's office also marks a significant, generational shift: it is the moment when global and technological convergence has reached the point where it is possible for the leader of Britain's public-service broadcaster to land a $5m-a-year job as boss of the company behind the New York Times, the most famous newspaper in the US.</p> <p>The appointment also represents a substantial personal endorsement of the 55-year-old Briton and his stewardship of the BBC. While enjoying the benefits of guaranteed licence-fee funding to the tune of \u00a33.6bn a year, he has nevertheless proven able to develop the corporation digitally (selling Doctor Who episodes via iTunes overseas), maintain quality on screen despite lapses over phone-ins and taste, and navigate constant political pressure led by the Murdoch press.</p> <p>Not since Sir William Haley left the BBC in 1952 to become editor of the Times has a DG quit for a job in newspapers \u2013 and none has gone to America. The early days of broadcasting might have seen senior executives moving between the two, but as television developed, the fissure between print and broadcast widened \u2013 until the internet turned everything on its head.</p> <p>Today, the lines of competition have blurred. The BBC's generously funded website competes with a press trying to embrace multimedia \u2013 and the cash available at the BBC has helped give its executives a digital background that newspapers can only eye with jealousy.</p> <p>It was once felt that the BBC was closer to publicly funded arts organisations than red-blooded commercial media: a decade ago, Tony Hall left BBC News to run the Royal Opera House. Now, though, life after the BBC looks very different. Last year, another former senior BBC manager, Ashley Highfield, who led the development of the iPlayer, which had transformed the viewing habits of a nation, became the chief executive of Johnston Press, the newspaper group that owns the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post.</p> <p>When Thompson arrived at the top of the BBC eight years ago, it was at a high-profile national organisation in some peril, with both its chairman and his predecessor, Greg Dyke, having resigned. The New York Times occupies a similar position in the US imagination, and faces financial pressures that have forced it to sell regional newspapers and stakes in sport clubs, including Liverpool FC, to concentrate on a handful of brands \u2013 the New York Times itself, the Boston Globe and the International Herald Tribune.</p> <p>Thompson's final interview was in early July, to give him plenty of time to concentrate on the Olympics. At the heart of his pitch for the job was to emphasise the importance of video journalism, and of taking a professional approach to its production. Print, he believes, will still be the New York Times's principal means of transmitting information, but with 509,000 online subscribers to serve, a newspaper now needs to tell stories using cameras and the techniques of a John Simpson or Jeremy Paxman. In time, perhaps, the newspaper may create its own TV channel \u2013 transmitted, perhaps, via YouTube rather than over cable or satellite.</p> <p>It was part of what Arthur Sulzberger, the chairman and controlling shareholder in the New York Times Company, wanted to hear. The New York Times also wants to extend its brand overseas \u2013 the paper has just launched a digital edition in Mandarin, following an online version aimed at India the year before \u2013 and having a non-American in charge is one way to ensure that the paper develops from its roots as a big city newspaper into a news brand with a global reach and audience to match. Although recently overtaken by the celebrity-heavy Daily Mail as the world's leading online newspaper, the New York Times remains, by some distance, the most-read upmarket title.</p> <p>Journalists on the ground say they couldn't care less that Thompson is not from their side of the Atlantic. David Carr, a media columnist at the New York Times, says: \"The days of provincialism around geography, or platform for that matter, are long past. The NYT is in the global information business, this guy has shown an ability to build and manage news enterprises at that scale, so his background seems relevant to the task at hand\" \u2013 even if, he adds, the new leader pronounces the word \"schedule\" differently.</p> <p>Those close to the selection process in New York say that there was no single factor that swung the decision in Thompson's favour. The critics were quick to point out that the BBC man has not had any experience running a profit-making company, apart perhaps from a short stint running state-owned, advertiser-funded Channel 4 in the early part of the last decade. But Thompson's allies point to the rapid growth of BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm that exploits BBC brands for profit, and in particular its digital revenues, which amounted to \u00a3139m last year.</p> <p>Digital, for BBC Worldwide, also sees content being streamed into the US, meaning that BBC content is becoming gradually more visible in that country too. BBC Worldwide also distributed E4's Misfits, which became a surprise hit on Hulu, a US internet television service, last year. For his part, Thompson believes that his most important challenge at the New York Times will be to replace declining print advertising revenues with digital income, at a time when the number of web subscriptions and page views demonstrate the audience for journalism is, if anything, growing.</p> <p>The outgoing BBC boss, meanwhile, believes that the corporation's coverage of the Olympics, through 24 dedicated digital channels and bespoke apps to stream Games video to tablets and mobiles, represents the apotheosis of his achievement at the corporation. Opinion polls even suggest that public approval of the BBC rose as a result of the Games \u2013 by a higher proportion than the Queen, Boris Johnson or even the city of London itself \u2013 and while Thompson acknowledges that he cannot easily take credit for any specific aspect of the Olympics broadcasts, he was a keen enthusiast of ensuring that every moment of sporting action was covered live.</p> <p>That meant the BBC striking a commercial deal with its traditional rival Sky, a deal in which the Murdoch-influenced satellite broadcaster ended up promoting the corporation's Olympic content on and off air.</p> <p>But Thompson was being wooed well before the Olympics. His first contact with Sulzberger was in January, just as it emerged he was planning to leave the BBC later in the year later in the year. His relationship with the 60-year-old chairman will be critical, not least because, as publisher of the New York Times, Sulzberger has a hand in editorial appointments that Thompson himself will be denied. But with the Briton no stranger to navigating complex internal governance, he is hopeful that he can strike up a relationship that will allow him to have an impact. As a start, Thompson has already met with other key members of the Sulzberger family, before his final interview with the company's board took place in the early part of last month.</p> <p>The decision, though, did not come through until the middle of the Games, perhaps as the first British athletics gold medals came through \u2013 although final negotiations over pay ensured that his appointment was kept quiet long enough for the closing ceremony to conclude and the Briton to fly over to New York on Tuesday. The distance between London and New York, just as between television and newspapers, public and private media, has never felt closer.</p> <h2>Media stars who shine brightly across the Atlantic</h2> <p><strong>Lucian Grainge, chief executive, </strong></p> <p><strong>Universal Music Group</strong></p> <p>Once described as the \"killer shark\" because of his competitive instincts, Grainge runs the world's biggest music company from Los Angeles rather than the company's traditional HQ in New York. Chief executive Doug Morris, who now runs rival Sony Music, was eased out by Universal's owner to clear the way for Grainge, an Arsenal fan, in 2011. Grainge, 52, is now embroiled in a battle to complete the \u00a31.2bn takeover of EMI Music and is locked in negotiations with European and US regulators.</p> <p><strong>Anna Wintour, editor in chief, Vogue</strong></p> <p>The eldest daughter of Charles Wintour, a former editor of the London Evening Standard, Wintour has edited Vogue for 24 years and is the most influential \u2013 and best known \u2013 name in fashion journalism. The demanding personality of the so-called \"ice queen\", now 62, was fictionalised in The Devil Wears Prada, but her energetic fundraising efforts for Barack Obama have led to reports that she could be named US ambassador to London if the president is re-elected.</p> <p><strong>Tina Brown, editor in chief, the Daily Beast and Newsweek</strong></p> <p>Journalist Brown moved to New York with husband Harold Evans after he left the Times. She edited a succession of magazines, starting with Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, before founding the short-lived Talk.

Thirty years at CBS saw him rise to the top before he switched to run Sony's US interests \u2013 its film studio and music company \u2013 in 1997 and earned the title of the most influential Briton in Hollywood. Stringer, 70, was chief executive of Sony between 2005 and 2012 and remains chairman. He is a friend of Mark Thompson and recently joined the board of broadband company Talk Talk.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 August 2012 to clarify that Misfits, although distributed in the US by BBC Worldwide, was shown in the UK on E4.</p>",
  "<p>If you're unusually insightful and perceptive, like me, you may have noticed that boastfulness is increasingly socially acceptable these days. Perhaps this helps explain the unhinged gusto with which Usain Bolt declared himself a living legend last week at the Olympics: in a world where every other Facebook status update is a veiled act of self-aggrandisement, the only way to make an impact with your bragging is to push it to the limit. The more everyday kind of bragging \u2013 the mock-shy mention of your latest professional achievement, the smartphone photographs of your current holiday idyll, the drive-by name-dropping \u2013 is the fuel that powers social media.</p> <p>Laughing at others' clunky efforts at self-promotion used to be a strictly annual pleasure, confined to the opening of round-robin Christmas letters; now it's a daily chore. This is why, speaking for myself, I try not to add to the problem by engaging in too much boastfulness in public forums. But then I have often been complimented on my restraint \u2013 once, indeed, by a rather prominent celebrity, whose name I probably ought not&#xa0;to mention here.</p> <p>Technology is partly to blame: with so many more channels through which to manipulate one's public image, it's not especially surprising that we are tempted to present ourselves as positively as possible. The filters of social media make things worse. A&#xa0;network such as Twitter is designed precisely to connect you with exactly the kinds of people who don't mind your boasts, while those who might keep you in check won't follow you in the first place: your audience thus serves as an army of enablers, applauding your self-applause. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2012/08/writers_and_readers_on_twitter_and_tumblr_we_need_more_criticism_less_liking_.html\" title=\"\">Writing recently in Slate</a>, the literary critic Jacob Silverman complained that this self-reinforcing niceness was damaging his trade, by dissuading people from criticising books they disliked. \"It's not only shallow, it's untrue,\" he wrote, \"and it's having a chilling effect on literary culture.\"</p> <p>But, as the Wall Street Journal noted this week, in a worried piece headlined <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444184704577587091630924000.html\" title=\"\">Are We All Braggarts Now?</a>, the causes may be economic, too. In the most competitive job market in recent memory, the pressure to portray yourself as better than everyone else is intense. Predictably, there's neuroscientific evidence to undergird all this: self-disclosure activates the same brain regions as eating or sex, according to research by Harvard neuroscientists <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/01/1202129109.short\" title=\"\">published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, though you can bet they mentioned it on their Facebook pages too.</p> <p>And as bragging grows ubiquitous, it evolves, the better to penetrate the defences of those who would otherwise be too embarrassed to engage in it. Hence the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Humblebrag\" title=\"\">\"humblebrag\"</a>, that staple of Twitter-boasting that deploys self-deprecation in order surreptitiously to draw attention to the bragger's brilliance or privilege. Here's Cheryl Cole: \"How can I still be nervous about red carpets after 10 years. Eeek!\" And a classic from George Bush's former press secretary Ari Fleischer: \"They just announced my flight at LaGuardia is number 15 for takeoff. I miss Air Force One!!\"</p> <p>By now, though, even the humblebrag is growing easy to spot, thereby defeating its purpose, and so it is giving way to a new mutation, spotted and named by blogger Jen Doll: <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/08/hello-underbrag-best-dang-bragging-whole-wide-world/55766/\" title=\"\">the \"underbrag\"</a>.</p> <p>Underbragging involves referring to an embarrassing pratfall or stupid error that has no redeeming aspects: it constitutes a \"brag\" only because you are demonstrating that you can mention it without fear of being fired by your employer, grounded by your parents, or ostracised by your peers. \"The underbrag is the new humblebrag,\" Doll&#xa0;writes, \"because it is the brag that doesn't care what The Man thinks, the brag that pulls no punches, the brag that does whatever its braggy little heart desires.\"</p> <p>If I mention that I fell asleep drunk on the sofa last night, surrounded by the detritus of a half-consumed McDonald's meal and empty cider bottles, you might not envy me. But that's precisely the point: by telling the world, I'm implying that I don't care that you don't envy me, and that I am secure enough to report my debauchery without needing to contemplate the consequences. Which is why you should envy me.</p> <p>This is all rather dispiriting, but there's no point in trying to fight the new culture of boasting. Speak out against it and the wrong people will take note: the hesitant, self-conscious self-promoters will retreat, leaving the field to be dominated by the ultra-confident. If&#xa0;we're all braggarts now, at least let's hear not just from the obnoxious hype artists but also from the intelligent, good-natured, likable people. Such as&#xa0;\u2013&#xa0;just as an example, I mean, and without wanting to sound big-headed about it or anything \u2013 me.</p> <h2>Why Obama passes the beer test<br></h2> <p>Another reason to fear a Mitt Romney presidency: he would surely bring an end to the small brewery that, it was revealed this week, operates from inside the White House.

The beer comes in a light and dark variety, he added. \"I've only tried the light, and it's quite refreshing.\"</p> <p>Since Romney is a committed teetotaler, Obama had already won the classic test of presidential likability \u2013 \"which candidate would you rather have a beer with?\" \u2013 this time around. But now we know he'd bring the beer too, which is even better. Or a depressingly socialistic example of government trying to do things best left to private enterprise. One or the other.</p>",
  "<p>The RSPCA's emphasis on people rather than dogs being the problem in dog attacks echoes the mantra of the gun lobby (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/09/dog-bite-hospital-admissions-rise?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Dog attacks rise across England</a>, 10 August). Until we crack the problem of human behaviour, dogs which are bred, bought and brandished specifically for their aggression are every bit as dangerous as guns \u2013 and should be controlled in the same way. It would appear that successive governments may have shown little interest in controlling dangerous dogs because attacks are generally confined to working-class areas. People in these areas need real protection, not more useless lectures about how it's the owner's fault.<br><strong>Peter McKenna</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 During my career as a crown prosecutor I saw too many photos of adults and children with scars from attacks by large-toothed dogs. The dogs were sometimes put down after the incident; the adults often showed inadequate awareness of the danger their animals presented. Some of the dogs, although not of the types prohibited under section 1 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, were kept for their aggressiveness.</p> <p>There is a cheap and simple way of reducing the number of attacks. The home secretary has a power under section 2 of the act, which has never been used, to impose controls on dogs not prohibited under section 1 but which present a serious danger to the public. This includes the power to require such dogs to be muzzled when in a public place. Muzzling is largely self-policing, like wearing seatbelts, because a breach of the law would be readily seen. Having the dog on a lead is not enough, for the dog may escape.</p> <p>It should be applied to the types of dogs involved in the most serious cases: Staffordshire bull terriers, rottweilers, German shepherds. Such a restriction would make these dogs less attractive as trophy dogs. All that is needed is action by the home secretary.<br><strong>David Tucker</strong><br><em>Thirsk, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is a very simple solution to this problem: the reintroduction of the dog licence at a rate of \u00a3100 per year coupled with chipping. Exemptions to be made only for OAPs. Any dog found without a chip or untaxed and any dog that attacks a human being is to be immediately seized and humanely destroyed the same day. Since they are not human any question of human rights violation is irrelevant.<br><strong>Edward Lewis</strong><br><em>Keele, Staffordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Ron Stringer (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/14/michael-goves-imperial-inclinations?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 15 August) suggests that muzzling dogs in public places would reduce the number of attacks. Given that it is normally status dogs that are involved, perhaps the required fitting of a sparkly pink harness and matching tutu would reduce ownership and therefore halt both the attacks and the startling rate of abandonment once the dog becomes too old or too strong to control.<br><strong>Howard Teece</strong><br><em>Winchester, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Certain types of dog muzzles are not suitable for dogs to wear in hot weather. Yes, they may stop a dog opening its jaws to bite but they also prevent the dog from panting, which is crucial in hot weather in order for the animal to keep cool. The RSPCA offers advice on the suitability of certain muzzles and the length of time they should be worn.<br><strong>Elaine Hall</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p>",
  "<p>Those of us who are forever fascinated by American politics can wheel out two standard quotations about the American vice-presidency. The first, elegantly uttered by the first holder of the office, George Washington's deputy John Adams, describes it as \"the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived\". The second, saltier and better known, comes from John Nance \"Cactus Jack\" Garner, 32nd vice-president, who dismissed the job, which was his under Franklin Roosevelt from 1933 to 1941 as \"not worth a bucket of warm piss\".</p> <p>Not even the occasionally megalomaniac tenure of Dick Cheney from 2001 to 2009 has quite managed to transform the significance of the vice-presidency from the post described by Adams and Garner. Certainly Joe Biden's four low-profile years in the post under Barack Obama have confirmed it. They have been far less noteworthy than Cheney's \u2013 and historically far more typical. The old Washington line about the unfortunate mother who had two sons who were never heard from again \u2013 one was lost at sea and the other became vice-president \u2013 still holds true.</p> <p>Yet it was handy to be reading Robert Caro's latest volume of biography on Lyndon Johnson, a work which contains all the dismissive jokes about the vice-presidency just cited and several more besides, when news came through of the nomination of Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to be Mitt Romney's running mate. It was a useful corrective to the instinct to dismiss the post, since Ryan, the hugely influential House budget committee chairman who has been thrust to prominence by a combination of economic crisis and political polarisation, is one of the most powerful inside-the-Beltway Washington politicians to be offered a shot at the vice-presidency since Johnson himself ran with Jack Kennedy in 1960.</p> <p>Many of his contemporaries thought Johnson was crazy to exchange his unprecedentedly powerful role as majority leader in the Senate for the obscurity of the vice-presidency. Johnson being Johnson, however, there was immense calculation in the move since, as he himself said to Clare Booth Luce at the Inauguration Ball in 1961 with tragic prescience: \"Clare, I looked it up: one out of every four presidents has died in office. I'm a gamblin' man, darlin', and this is the only chance I got.\"</p> <p>Johnson was confident he would be&#xa0;able to shape the administration from&#xa0;the vice-presidency. One of his own&#xa0;favourite sayings, much quoted by&#xa0;Caro, was: \"Power is where power goes.\" It was the individual who mattered, in other words, not the office. As it turned out, Johnson miscalculated massively, because Kennedy marginalised his deputy. But the saying may yet turn out to be a useful aphorism&#xa0;if the focused, intelligent and powerful Ryan ever gets to be vice-president under the almost congenitally indecisive and equivocal Romney.</p> <p>That's because, if the two of them defeat Obama in November, America will have elected itself one of the most anti-government leaderships in its history, and it is likely to be one in which Ryan sets the tone and perhaps calls the shots. Ryan is a deeply serious fiscal conservative and anti-federal government politician. He is also a man in a hurry. He should absolutely not be underestimated. He wants Washington to get out of the pensions business and replace the existing Medicare system with vouchers. He has argued for the reduction of income tax to two rates \u2013 10% and 25%. He wants to repeal Obama's healthcare legislation and remove tax incentives for employers to provide health insurance. He sees America engaged in an existential struggle to avoid what he sees as an Obama-inspired slide into European socialism.</p> <p>By choosing Ryan, Romney has ensured that the 2012 election will be an ideological fight. It will be, <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/the-a-list/2012/08/13/americas-clear-choice-franklin-roosevelt-or-ayn-rand/#axzz23d2GgW9q\" title=\"\">as Simon Schama has put it</a>, a choice between the America of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal institutions and the America of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/paul-ryan-ayn-rand-romney\" title=\"\">individualist cult of Ayn Rand</a>, of which Ryan is an enthusiastic adherent. Europeans, accustomed to thinking that elections are won in the centre ground, by capturing independent voters, tend to assume \u2013 and hope \u2013 that the choice of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/15/paul-ryan-paradox-us-politics\" title=\"\">Ryan will therefore be counter-productive</a>. But this is a dangerous assumption, even though some US commentators, even conservatives, also share it.</p> <p>It is dangerous because American voters have repeatedly upended that assumption, whether in the disputed presidential election of 2000, or in the congressional votes in 1994 and 2010. In&#xa0;an America where economic growth is fragile, job trends erratic, and the federal deficit massive (thanks primarily to George Bush not Obama), this distinctive American conservative strength, so unlike the politics of most of western Europe, but combined with the globally familiar anti-incumbent feeling of hard times, may be hard to stop. This isn't yet a rerun of 2008, when another reckless choice of running mate by another Republican presidential candidate whom the grassroots of the party did not like, effectively handed the election to the Democrats. Sarah Palin was ludicrous. Paul Ryan is serious. And this is a much tighter contest, in harder times, against an incumbent president who has disappointed some of his more naive supporters.</p> <p>The true importance of the 2012 US election as seen from outside America may rest on a different paradox. This is an immensely important election for Americans. But it is an election with surprisingly little resonance outside America. It is a contest between two candidates and parties which are so thoroughly shaped by exceptional American conditions and traditions \u2013 many of which come back, in the end, to the slow and domestically painful decline of American power \u2013 that it offers few of the lessons which the British political class loves to obsess about. Ryan is very unlike any significant British or continental European conservative politician.</p> <p>That is not to say that the outcome does not matter to non-Americans. Or that we don't have our preferences about who wins. But the reality is that both Obama-Biden (assuming that Biden remains on the ticket) and Romney-Ryan are focused on America first, and that their view of the world is one in which Europe is a source of problems to be avoided, not of models to be emulated. American politics is always irresistible entertainment. But Americans do not have the answers to Europe's problems, any more than Europeans have the answers to America's. Serious grownup politics for Europeans begins here in Europe, now more than ever.</p>",
  "<p>The security services warned the Olympic authorities about a potential cyber-attack on their power supply days before the Games opening ceremony, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The warning is believed to have led to an urgent check on a backup system and test whether it could take the massive strain from the Olympics lighting and communications networks.</p> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, earlier this year specifically warned of the possibility of attacks on the Olympics by terrorists stressing in particular the threat from what she called \"hacktivists\".</p> <p>A successful attack on the computerised power system would have caused chaos, stopped the ceremony, and blocked all communications.</p> <p>Whitehall sources insist that subsequent investigations showed the threat was not credible. However, it is understood to have provoked enough concern to have prompted an immediate check on the Olympic Park's backup manually-operated power supply.</p> <p>A government spokesperson told the Guardian: \"We do not comment on specific threats. The high profile of the Olympic Games meant that it was a potential target and we put in measures to help protect against such threats and we are committed to ensuring every conceivable preparation is made in order to deliver a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games\".</p> <p>The home secretary warned in January that there was \"a strong possibility\" of a \"threat from cybercrime\".</p> <p>She added in a speech to the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi): \"We are aware of the threat from so called 'hacktivist' groups. These groups may attempt to target the games and may also attack the websites of high-profile sponsors associated with the Games.\"</p> <p>May continued: \"We already have our own robust plans in place to deal with a cyber-attack against Games systems. And we are now also working with industry to strengthen their ability to defend themselves from cyber-attacks.\"</p> <p>Ministers and officials have repeatedly stressed that most cyber-attacks come from hostile state agencies, and most of those were Chinese or Russian. However, they are unlikely to have attempted any attack on the Olympics, an event in which their athletes were to come high in the medals table, ending up, respectively, first and fourth.</p> <p>Any perpetrator of a cyber-attack would more likely have been an individual, or group of individuals, determined to provoke havoc and demonstrate their ability to hack into powerful and vital computer networks.</p> <p>\"We know we face a real and enduring threat from terrorism and we know that the Games \u2013 as an iconic event \u2013 will represent a target for terrorist groups,\" May said in her Rusi speech. \"Our Olympic security plans have been developed against an assumption that the terrorist threat level at the time of the games will be severe\".</p> <p>The parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC) said in its latest annual report that MI5 had \"planned on the basis of an increased terrorist threat during the Games, resulting in greater volumes of intelligence to be analysed and responded to, coupled with a shorter turnaround time and a lower risk threshold than would normally be applied to such intelligence\".</p> <p>The alert before the Olympics opening ceremony underlines a widespread feeling of vulnerability across government departments and agencies towards cyber-attacks. GCHQ, the government's electronic eavesdropping agency, has a lead role in cyber \"warfare\" and staff there have expressed concern about the lack of funds and staff to cope with a growing threat.</p> <p>\"Cybersecurity is a fast-paced field and delays in developing our capabilities give our enemies the advantage. We are therefore concerned that much of the work to protect UK interests in cyberspace is still at an early stage,\" the ISC said.</p> <p>Five people were charged with terrorism offences earlier this month but they, and other arrests at the time were not related to the Olympics, security and intelligence sources said. The sources expressed delight that the Olympics passed without an actual attack.</p>",
  "<p>Selling food on the street has always been a tough business, and the signs are that it is not getting any easier. Recently, in the Lancashire town of Blackburn, a turf war for control of the lucrative local ice-cream business allegedly <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlPxbowJlXg&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">led the driver of a Mr Yummy van to smash the&#xa0;window of a rival Mr Whippy</a> with&#xa0;a&#xa0;tyre iron.</p> <p>Of course this incident is nowhere near as alarming as Glasgow's notorious ice-cream wars \u2013 a campaign of violence, intimidation and arson that resulted in a number of deaths in the 1980s. However, a burgeoning interest in British street food has contributed to rising tensions between newcomers and established local businesses.</p> <p>For many people running a street food operation is an attractive proposition. Start-up costs and pitch fees are low. Unlike restaurants or cafes, street food vendors pay no rent or rates. Meanwhile, the profit margin on gourmet products is greater than it&#xa0;is on a traditional roadside hotdog or burger.</p> <p>Traders such as Yianni Papoutsis of <a href=\"http://www.themeatwagon.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Meatwagon</a> in London and Claire Kelsey of <a href=\"http://www.gingerscomfortemporium.com/\" title=\"\">Ginger's Comfort Emporium</a> in Manchester have helped create a buzz that has spread around the country. But as the recession bites, these differences are causing problems.</p> <p>Take for example <a href=\"http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/angry-leeds-city-centre-traders-claim-market-events-are-costing-them-thousands-1-4697122\" title=\"\">the clashes at a new market on Briggate</a> in Leeds, home to the city's branch of Harvey Nichols and an array of luxury brands.&#xa0;One street food trader says that he had a parcel of fish guts dumped on his van.&#xa0;Another claims to have been told that, if she dared&#xa0;to come back, she would be blockaded in. The police were contacted and now the council is trying &#xa0;to&#xa0;pick up the pieces.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.picklesandpotter.co.uk\" title=\"\">Pickles &amp; Potter Deli Cafe</a>, by the new market, Lorna Potter, who was not involved in either incident, pays more than \u00a350,000 rent a year, plus rates. She insists that her objection to street food vendors isn't born of snobbery. \"Street food just doesn't give&#xa0;the right message \u2026 It's like putting a sewage treatment works right&#xa0;next to a beautiful organic farm,\"&#xa0;she says.</p> <p>Andrew Critchett, who runs the stall <a href=\"http://www.fishand.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fish&amp;</a>, offers high-end, sustainable seafood at the market. He disagrees: \"City centres need to become more community and experience-focused. Street-food markets lend a real vibrancy that adds to the independent spirit in Leeds city centre.\"</p> <p>Street traders argue that they do not use the same facilities as restaurateurs so shouldn't pay the same rates. They are, they say, simply delivering restaurant-quality food at takeaway prices, regenerating city centres and&#xa0;showcasing diversity.</p> <p>Mark Laurie, director of the <a href=\"http://www.ncass.org.uk\" title=\"\">Nationwide Caterers Association</a> \u2013 the&#xa0;trade body for Britain's street food&#xa0;industry \u2013 agrees that \"street food&#xa0;can sit happily alongside bricks and mortar&#xa0;restaurants, as has been proven across London. In instances such as Leeds, the idea behind street food and regeneration has not been sold or explained to the local businesses effectively.\"</p> <p>Over in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire, a similar story is playing out. Dave Rawson, who sells seasonal British specialities from <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/thegreedybassetskitchen\" title=\"\">the Greedy Bassets Kitchen</a>, says the council offered him an idyllic pitch on the end&#xa0;of the pier. He is now in dispute with other traders over the spot and there is ongoing friction with several local food outlets.</p> <p>Rawson wonders why his tiny business is seen as such a threat. But as he sears his local catch of the day, one possible answer may be in the line that's building up for lunch.</p>",

  "<p>This is nifty. First, take members of the baby-boom generation with their skills and experience. Next, market them in a way that a generation brought up on Pixar would appreciate \u2013 by calling them <a href=\"http://www.theamazings.com/\" title=\"\">The Amazings</a>. Then, invite younger people to pay to learn from them. Finally, stand back and watch what happens.</p> <p>If you're sitting in Toppers hair salon in Hackney, east London,. as I was last week, exploring the finer points of the \"retro up do\", then you learn all kinds of things about the application of heated rollers. Or, at least, other people did. My mind, I confess, began to wander as Michael, our tutor for the night, transformed the hairdo of a young volunteer from something merely fashionable into something with striking architectural features. .</p> <p>I was also left confused by the generational aspect of the business. Michael, master of the back-comb, was perhaps only 20 years older than the youngest members of our group, and I didn't get the sense I was bearing witness to a rare act of generational skill transfer in Toppers. And I'm not sure how The Amazings answer the sociological question it poses: \"Maybe society is not as good at passing down these skills through generations as we used to be?\"</p> <p>Its inspiration, they say, are: \"The retired postman who can play the ukulele. The grandparent teaching children to sew.\" And it all sounds great, but I don't know of any grandchildren willing to dole out cash to Granny to teach them cross-stitch. Passing down a skill is not the same as selling it on. Both have their place, but I suspect only The Amazings' marketing benefits from eliding them.</p> <p>This year is \u2013 haven't you noticed? \u2013 the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/ey2012/\" title=\"\">European Year of Active Aging and Solidarity Between Generations</a> and as a result our Brussels overlords have been working on a range of projects designed to pull generations together. In the UK, the social enterprise Intergen has been sending retired people into primary schools to support reading and studying by the children. The volunteering charity CSV also has an impressive scheme open to all adult ages for mentoring students, offenders and even befriending older people.</p> <p>Both young and old suffer from generational isolation. Why is this? My suspicion is that if we fail to pass on our skills, it's just one symptom of a deeper problem: that, at their worst, young and old in Britain mistrust one another.</p> <p>For many, the riots confirmed what a decade of antisocial behaviour legislation has been suggesting already: that young people show \"no respect\". There's some evidence that their elders aren't entirely blameless either. A definitive <a href=\"http://www.if.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/The_Poor_Perception_of_Younger_People_in_the_UK_17Aug3.pdf\" title=\"\">European social survey</a> conducted over the last decade found that young people are much more likely to be viewed as \"incompetent\" and \"unfriendly\" in Britain than in any other European country. They are also considered to be \"less moral\" by their elders. Being young in Britain affords a pariah status all of its own. Age discrimination cuts both ways.</p> <p>It's for that reason that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/08/reeves-croydon-risen-ashes-community-too\" title=\"\">work of Vinspired and Trevor Reeves</a>, whose family furniture business was burned to the ground by last year's rioters, is so impressive. By covering the new premises with positive messages from Croydon's young people, they have helped to powerfully confound a stereotype of destructive youth.</p> <p>He reminds us that it is not proximity than binds a community together but empathy \u2013 and it's often most difficult between generations.</p> <p>Of course, the current predicament of Britain's young adults who can't afford to move out of the parental home means they're often enjoying proximity to their elders and betters by necessity. This point was hammered home in a conversation I had with Andrew, another of The Amazings who offers street photography courses. While he's always keen to share his skills and experiences with new people, Andrew doesn't need any assistance bridging the generational divide because he still lives with his two adult sons.</p> <p>And he's not alone. One third of young people under 30 live with their parents in Britain, rents and house prices in London have ascended to an all-time high and, well, you don't need me to rehearse <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2011/nov/16/youth-unemployment-map\" title=\"\">youth unemployment figures</a>.</p> <p>However many skills the young acquire, they're useless if no one will offer them a job or lend them the money to start a business. However much they want to stand on their own feet, they will stumble if rents are too high. As I left Toppers, I felt that it's not the passing down of skills that those long-lunching baby-boomers should be concerned about so much as the passing on of opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, and not for the first time, Juan Manuel S\u00e1nchez Gordillo found himself in the Spanish headlines. Dubbed \"Robin Hood\" by El Pais, S\u00e1nchez Gordillo, the mayor of a small town in rural Andalusia, led farm labourers into supermarkets <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9467635/Spanish-mayor-hailed-as-modern-day-Robin-Hood.html\" title=\"\">to expropriate basic living supplies</a>: they filled trolleys with pasta, sugar, chickpeas and milk, left without paying, and distributed the loot to local food banks. His reasoning was blunt: \"The crisis has a face and a name. There are many families who can't afford to eat.\"</p> <p>It's hard to overstate how close to the brink Spain is at the moment. Unemployment is at 25% nationally (higher than Greece), 34% in Andalusia and 53% for 16-to-24-year-olds; miners in Asturias are firing homemade rocket launchers at riot police; repossessions and the collapse of the construction industry have left 800,000 empty homes, and, last May, the 8 million-strong <em>indignados</em> protest movement, a forerunner of Occupy, announced its total lack of faith in parliamentary democracy to solve any of these problems. And this is just the phoney war: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/19/spain-austerity-protest-bank-bailout-bond\" title=\"\">last month, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, announced spending cuts of \u00a465bn (\u00a351bn) over the next two years</a>.</p> <p>In the heart of it all, like Asterix's village in Gaul implausibly holding out against the Romans, is S\u00e1nchez Gordillo's town, the self-described communist utopia of Marinaleda. With a population of 2,600, the town has virtually full employment, communally owned land and wage equality. Over the past three decades, the townspeople have built 350 family homes with their own hands. Residents pay a \"mortgage\" of just \u00a415&#xa0;a month towards their homes, but&#xa0;have no opportunity to profit from selling them on.</p> <p>When you first arrive, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinaleda,_Spain\" title=\"\">Marinaleda</a> looks the same as any small town in rural Andalusia, with olive groves stretching towards a dusty horizon, children kicking footballs against worn stone walls and parasols fluttering gently outside tapas bars. Soon, you begin to notice the little differences: the lack of advertising or brand names, the streets named for Ferm\u00edn Salvochea, the 19th-century anarchist mayor of Cadiz, and for Salvador Allende, Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Pablo Neruda.</p> <p>In the mayor's office hangs a framed portrait of Che Guevara, along with three flags: one for Andalusia, one for the Spanish Second Republic (the elected government displaced by Franco's military coup), and one sporting the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bandera_de_Marinaleda_%28Sevilla%29.svg\" title=\"\">red, white and green of Marinaleda itself</a>; it's very clean, and endearingly untidy. In one corner is a flip-chart covered with semi-legible marker pen scribbles, bullet points and wonky arrows; this, it transpires, is the town's budget.</p> <p>S\u00e1nchez Gordillo was born in Marinaleda in 1949; back then, he explains, it was a town of migrant workers. \"They would go to Germany, or France; or for two months a year, to the wheat fields to the north, to look for work. Otherwise, they were unemployed. It was misery. The surroundings were all huge expanses of private land. Andalusia is like Latin America: 2% of property owners own 50% of the land.\"</p> <p>After Franco's death in 1975, Marinaleda began struggling towards its own definition of freedom. Organising around a new trade union, a new workers' party, and with weekly mass meetings, the townspeople began occupying some of the land around the village, owned \u2013 and unused \u2013 by the Duke of Infantil. The police would arrest or evict them, and they'd start all over again. They blocked roads, broke into and shut down Malaga and Seville airports, marched on Madrid, and went on mass hunger strike. S\u00e1nchez Gordillo has been to jail seven times, and survived two assassination attempts by rightwing extremists.</p> <p>After 12 years of persistent struggle, with 1992's Seville World Expo just round the corner and the regional authorities' resolve finally weakening, incredibly, they won, securing 1,200 hectares of the duke's land for their farming cooperative.</p> <p>\"Our union gathers people of many political stripes,\" S\u00e1nchez Gordillo explains, \"but we carry the torch of anarchism's direct action.\" He cites 5,000 years of Andalusian struggle for land, and thinks for a moment. \"Even the weekly assembly is direct action.\"</p> <p>The town's relationship with the state is complicated. They are still subject to Spanish electoral law (S\u00e1nchez Gordillo is re-elected with a huge majority each time), but have abolished their police force. \"By law, due to the number of inhabitants we have here, we should have around four to seven cops,\" he tells me. \"But we don't want police here. Because we have our voluntary work, because we fight together, because we make our lives together, there is a high degree of coexistence. When we plant trees, we do it together too.\" S\u00e1nchez Gordillo's articulation of what \"community\" can mean is striking, when you consider how blithely the word is used by politicians across the west.</p> <p>\"Utopias aren't chimeras, they are the most noble dreams that people have. The dream of equality; the dream that housing should belong to everyone, because you are a person, and not a piece of merchandise to be speculated with; the dream that natural resources \u2013 for instance energy \u2013 shouldn't be in the service of multinationals, but in the service of the people. All those dreams are the dreams we'd like to turn into realities. First, in the place where we live, with the knowledge that we're surrounded by capitalism everywhere; and later, in Andalusia, and the world.\"</p> <p>Leaving the gleaming white town hall building and departing into the dusk, you find a metal arch spelling out the slogan <em>OTRO MUNDO ES POSIBLE</em>. Another world is possible. In Marinaleda, the words represent not an aspirational mirage, but a statement of fact.</p> <p>\u2022 Adapted from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/utopia2012\">Utopia and the Valley of Tears: A journey through the Spanish crisis</a>, an ebook available from amazon.co.uk from 20 August.</p>",
  "<p>Lord Morris of Manchester, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/14/lord-morris-of-manchester\" title=\"\">died</a> this week, was the father of disability rights in the UK. From personal experience of having a father wounded in the first world war he knew that a disabled member of a family meant a disabled family and usually an impoverished one.</p> <p>So much of what today we take for granted or as common sense can be traced back to the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1970/44\" title=\"\">Chronically Sick &amp; Disabled Persons Act 1970</a> and Morris's other initiatives.</p> <p>Elected to parliament in 1964 representing Manchester Wythenshawe, in 1969 he won the ballot to introduce a private members bill. He rejected the ready-baked bills the government offered him and introduced his own bill to improve the rights of disabled people. He was realistic in recognising that the chance of his bill becoming law was slight but it would, he thought, put disability issues on the agenda and promote publicity for disabled people at a time when they where out of sight and hardly mentioned in the press.</p> <p>It is a testament to his political skill and his ability to gather support from all parts of the House including that of prime minister, Harold Wilson, that the act did became law in May 1970, the day before parliament was dissolved for the general election.</p> <p>The act required local authorities to provide services to disabled people. It was the first to require public buildings to be accessible to wheelchair users and, although it proved impossible to enforce, it raised expectations. In the mid 1980s building regulations were changed to require new buildings to be accessible and by 2004, through the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/50/contents\" title=\"\">Disability Discrimination Act 1995</a>, existing buildings had to be made accessible.</p> <p>The act introduced the <a href=\"http:// www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/14/in-praise-of-blue-badge\" title=\"\">orange (now blue) badge scheme</a> to help disabled people park their cars, which is now used by more than 2 million people. The act also required for the first time some government committees to include disabled people.</p> <p>As the world's first minister for disabled people, which he became in 1974, Morris was able to attack the issue of disability poverty. He introduced the mobility allowance, now part of disability living allowance and soon to be personal independence payment (Pip). Motability, the leading car scheme for disabled people, was also one of Morris's initiatives. He argued that the allowance was no use unless it could be turned into actual mobility and 600,000 disabled people currently have a car through the scheme.</p> <p>Anti-discrimination legislation flowed from a report by the Committee on Restrictions Against Disabled People, which Morris established in 1979. During the following decade bills were introduced in parliament every year until in 1995 the Disability Discrimination Act was passed. The next 10 years were spent improving and implementing it.</p> <p>Today we argue for civil and human rights for disabled people. It is possible to identify developments in disability rights in which Morris played a small or no part but when the big ticket items are looked at his finger prints are still all over them.</p> <p>Yet his legacy is not safe. The huge improvements in social care provision after Morris's act began to be undermined in the 1980s and continue today with disabled people now carrying a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2011/sep/01/cuts-targeting-disabled-people\" title=\"\">disproportionate share</a> of the reduction in local authority expenditure as a result of central government cuts. The crude tick-box mechanical assessments <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/27/dla-care-homes-mobility-pledge\" title=\"\">this government proposes to introduce for Pip</a> will mean that many of the people for whom the original mobility allowance was designed will no longer qualify for it and some will lose entitlement to a vehicle.</p> <p>While the current government insists disabled people should be independent it is withdrawing many of the means to achieve this. Rhetoric is replacing provision.</p>",
  "<p>A leading US senator has asked other regulators to find the \"backbone\" to take action against Standard Chartered following the London-based bank's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/14/standard-chartered-pay-fine-regulator\" title=\"\">$340m (\u00a3220m) settlement </a>in New York over sanctions breaches with Iran.</p> <p>Carl Levin said on Wednesday that the steps taken by the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) that forced Standard Chartered to agree to the civil penalty showed that it was not necessary to go through years of negotiation.</p> <p>\"The agency also showed that holding a bank accountable for past misconduct doesn't need to take years of negotiation over the size of the penalty; it simply requires a regulator with backbone to act,\" said Levin, who last month <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">accused HSBC of a \"pervasively polluted\" culture</a> in laundering money for drug cartels and terrorists in a gruelling public hearing.</p> <p>Standard Chartered's share price rose on the FTSE 100 on Wednesday even as the bank attempted to broker a settlement with other regulators. It could face further fines from the US justice department and the US treasury, which are both investigating sanctions breaches that allegedly took place between 2001 and 2007. Settlements could come as soon as next week.</p> <p>Annemarie McAvoy, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at Fordham Law School in New York, said the pressure was on after the DFS moved alone to level charges. \"Given that New York extracted $340m, the other regulators will undoubtedly have to come up with similar resolutions,\" she said.</p> <p>Even though the bank's shares rose 4% to \u00a314.26, chief executive Peter Sands remains under pressure, as they have slumped from \u00a316 since the DFS made the damning charges last Monday. He is believed to have resumed the family holiday he broke off to tackle the DFS claims.</p> <p>Benjamin Lawsky, head of the DFS, claimed that Standard Chartered schemed to hide 60,000 transactions, valued at about $250bn, that breached sanctions with Iran. Sands admitted to only 300 breaches, with a value of about $14m.</p> <p>Anthony Sabino, a law professor at St John's University in New York, said Standard Chartered was \"far from out of the woods\", but he expected federal investigations to continue in a more low-key manner. \"Without a doubt the justice department and treasury will want to deal with this quickly. But I suspect they will want it done in a quieter manner,\" he said. He said Lawsky had acted \"like the Lone Ranger\".</p> <p>Analysts at UBS predicted the shares would rise: \"The aggregate of this fine, plus any additional recompense to other regulators, could total less than 1% of Standard Chartered's equity and the DFS fine represents around 6% of our current earnings forecast for Standard Chartered, suggesting the company will be able to absorb this cost and still deliver a 10th successive year of record profits.</p> <p>\"New York's regulatory action sends a strong message that the United States will not tolerate foreign banks giving rogue nations like Iran hidden access to the US financial system.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dear colleagues,</p> <p>As you are all aware, our company has been under intense scrutiny in the United Kingdom. I assured parliament and the Leveson inquiry that we would move quickly and aggressively to redress wrongdoing, co-operate with law enforcement officials and strengthen our compliance and ethics programme company-wide. With the support of our board of directors, I am pleased to tell you that we have made progress on each of these important steps.</p> <p>Gerson Zweifach, senior executive vice-president and group general counsel, News Corporation, is now our chief compliance officer and has assumed overall responsibility for our effort to create a more robust global compliance and ethics programme. Lisa Fleischman, vice-president and associate general counsel, News Corporation, is our deputy chief compliance officer and will exercise day-to-day operational responsibility for the global compliance and ethics programme. In these capacities, Gerson and Lisa will report regularly to the board of directors and the audit committee regarding the content and operation of the compliance and ethics programme.</p> <p>For purposes of the compliance and ethics programme, all of our business units will be organised into five compliance groups: the LA Cable and Broadcast Group; the LA Film and TV Production Group; the Europe and Asia Group; the Australia Group; and the New York News and Information Group. Each group will be headed by a group chief compliance officer who will report directly to Gerson and will focus full-time on compliance issues.</p> <p>We have already strengthened and expanded our anti-bribery training programmes. To ensure the effectiveness of our entire compliance and ethics programme, we have recently initiated a review of anti-corruption controls in selected locations around the globe. The purpose of this review is to test our current internal controls and identify ways in which we can enhance them. Let me emphasise that the review is not based on any suspicion of wrongdoing by any particular business unit or its personnel. Rather, it is a forward-looking review based on our commitment to improve anti-corruption controls throughout the company.</p> <p>We recognise that strengthening our compliance programmes will take time and resources, but the costs of non-compliance \u2013 in terms of reputational harm, investigations, lawsuits, and distraction from our mission to deliver on our promise to consumers \u2013 are far more serious.</p> <p>As one of the world's most innovative media companies, News Corporation serves a vital role in the global marketplace of ideas. Every day, hundreds of millions of people rely on us to provide high-quality news, sports programming, and entertainment. To continue to be worthy of the trust of our audiences around the world, we all have an affirmative obligation to adhere to the highest standards of ethical behaviour, consistent with our standards of business conduct. The enhancements to the compliance function that are already underway and that we are planning will help us to maintain those standards.</p> <p>Please join with me in this important effort and give it your full co-operation and support.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft has now made the release build of Windows 8 available to developers and IT administrators with subscriptions. The empire strikes back, or the beginning of the end for Windows? </p> <p>It could be either. Windows 8 has had a mixed reception from those who have tried it in preview, with complaints mainly focused on the awkwardness of combining what often feels like two different operating systems into one. Microsoft has consciously made it hard to stay in the familiar Windows desktop environment and ignore the new-style \"Modern\" user interface, formerly known as Metro, which is optimised for touch control.</p> <p>There is only one Start menu, and it uses the Modern UI, while common files types such as images and PDF documents open by default in Modern apps. It makes for a jarring experience, especially if you have a laptop or desktop PC rather than a tablet.</p> <p>The release version of Windows 8 is not radically different from the previews, but there are some new things. The translucent window effects of the Aero theme in Windows 7 have gone, replaced by a blander, squarer look more in keeping with the Modern UI.</p> <p>The Windows 8 Store is coming to life, and a few paid-for apps have appeared, though the number should increase sharply by the time of general retail availability on 6 October. Currently it is still sparsely populated, though there are a few stand-out apps such as Weather and Finance.</p> <p>Note that while the Store only includes Modern UI apps for install and update, it also has links to external sites for selected desktop apps.</p> <h2>A new start</h2> <p>One cosmetic but welcome change is in the way shortcuts for desktop applications appear in the Start screen. In the preview, each one was a tiny icon surrounded by a big block of wasted space. There is still plenty of wasted space, but the icons are now bigger and centralised, improving their appearance (see screenshot at top). </p> <p>Microsoft has also been busy fixing bugs and fine-tuning performance. Windows 8 has demonstrated solid improvements over Windows 7 from the first preview, and the release build feels solid and brisk.</p> <p>Microsoft mentions several specifics: faster disk access yielding 10-20% speed-up in operations such as installing large applications; up to 35% faster resume from hibernation; much faster graphics and text rendering thanks to hardware acceleration, ranging from around 40% faster decoding of JPEG images to 438% faster drawing of rectangles, and much quicker Wi-Fi reconnection.</p> <p>What this means for desktop users is that if you can learn to live with occasional Modern UI inconveniences, it is hard to go back to Windows 7 \u2013 which feels distinctly slower on the same hardware.</p> <h2>In transition?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394988334\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345050920077/tutorial.png\" alt=\"Windows 8 tutorial\" width=\"460\" height=\"218\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Windows 8 now has a tutorial for new users</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another key question is whether Microsoft has done enough to get users past their initial disorientation. The main difference compared to the previews is the appearance of new animations at the end of the Windows 8 setup.</p> <p>\"After your PC is ready move the mouse into any corner,\" says the animation aimed at keyboard and mouse users, while there is a similar effort to encourage users to swipe in from the sides if using a tablet. This is minimal though, and many will need a more detailed survival guide. Some issues, notably the existence of two versions of Internet Explorer, are long-term annoyances.</p> <p>There are signs that Windows 8 is a transitional operating system. Even if you like the Modern UI and want to work in it as much as possible, the desktop is unavoidable for some tasks, and operations \u2013 say, safely removing an external USB drive \u2013 are awkward when there is no mouse available.</p> <p>Go to personalise your desktop, and you will find that while the colour selection dialog is touch-friendly, the Sounds control applet is little changed from Windows 7 and awkward without a mouse. Windows has always had its share of design inconsistency, but this is the most extreme in that respect.</p> <h2>Things to like</h2> <p>Along with the niggles, there is plenty to like. Installing and updating apps from the Store is delightfully easy, and safer than running third-party installers for desktop apps. The process of purchasing music or renting a video is similar to what we have already seen from Apple, Amazon and Google, but having this fully integrated with the operating system and with the same Microsoft account you use to sign into Windows does make it more seamless to use. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394988335\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345050979263/buy-video.png\" alt=\"Windows 8: buy a video\" width=\"460\" height=\"228\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Windows 8 lets you buy or rent videos as easily as in iTunes or on Android, for multiple devices including PC, Xbox and Windows Phone</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behind the Modern UI distractions there is a big and impressive vision. For the consumer, it involves bringing together cloud, PC, tablet, Xbox and Windows Phone so that your content is available across all devices (within reason \u2013 no Office documents on Xbox), and getting settings like social media accounts and internet favourites (aka bookmarks) roam with you.</p> <p>The pitch to businesses is about migrating to a world of personal, touch-controlled mobile devices without losing the security and manageability Microsoft has developed for Windows PCs. Note that the forthcoming Windows Phone 8 is built on the same kernel as Windows 8, and with a similar developer platform.</p> <p>Microsoft's Office suite also has a key role, differentiating Windows 8 tablets from those running Apple iOS or Google Android, and enabling tablet users to do almost all their work without unpacking a laptop. </p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Report after report shows that the Windows ecosystem is hurting, and not only because of global recession. Macs at the high end, and Apple's iPad and iPhone, and Google Android in mobile, are eroding sales of PCs and laptops.</p> <p>Windows 8 is Microsoft's answer, and it is good work. The Modern UI environment is not only enjoyable for touch users, but also fixes many long-standing Windows problems around security, performance, and ease of use. Combine it with cloud services including the Windows Store, Office 2013 and Office 365, SkyDrive and Skype, and you can see that all the pieces are there.</p> <p>On the other hand, Microsoft is late to the tablet game \u2013 very late. App developers busy creating apps for iOS and Android will not rush to port to Windows 8 Modern UI until they see a strong market, and in that context the last thing Microsoft needs is Windows diehards devising ways to stay permanently in the desktop world, or vowing to stick with Windows 7, and there will be plenty of both.</p> <p>All this makes the fate of Windows 8 and its ecosystem a tough one to call. What is certain though is that if Microsoft had merely offered a refined, improved and faster Windows 7, the continuing decline of Windows would have been assured.</p> <p>Windows 8 is bold and different, and underpinned by solid technical improvements. Yes, it is confusing and inconsistent, needs more apps, and is tricky for existing Windows users getting started; but it is also the most capable tablet operating system out there and a useful upgrade for desktop users.

  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Probably the only sport in which sitting down well is rewarded. This bouncy branch of gymnastics was invented when a woman in 19th-century London jumped from a burning building on to a stretched-out bedsheet, only to provoke spontaneous applause from onlookers when she accidentally performed a half-twist leading into a pike. And that is a fact.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>A routine consists of 10 contacts with the \"bed\", starting and finishing on the feet, with participants allowed one bounce to control themselves before landing at the end and remaining stationary for three seconds. Three postures are recognised during jumps \u2013 tucked (knees clasped to chest), piked (arms and legs straight, body bent) and straight \u2013 and you can land on your bum, feet, front and back.</p> <p>Beginners won't be concerned with any of this. The best thing about trampolining is that it's easy to start \u2013 see kids, bouncy castles \u2013 and doesn't require any special clobber. Just the big bouncy thing in the gym.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>Trampolining improves balance, flexibility and co-ordination, as well as strengthening the leg muscles. As a low-impact sport it carries minimal risk of wear-and-tear-based injuries (unless you regularly fall off). Rebounding subjects you to twice the usual force of gravity, which can help prevent osteoporosis by working the musculoskeletal system \u2013 and there's even evidence to suggest it boosts your lymphatic function.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>Unless you want to buy your own trampoline (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003BF6IO8/ref=asc_df_B003BF6IO87359247?smid=A1IAW2UHK0VK22&amp;tag=googlecouk06-21&amp;linkCode=asn&amp;creative=22218&amp;creativeASIN=B003BF6IO8\">this one</a>, for instance, costs \u00a3120, has a safety net and can be used by adults and kids), your best bet is to inquire at your local sports hall for classes, or to use <a href=\"http://www.trampolining-online.co.uk/links/trampoline-clubs.php\">this club finder</a>. <a href=\"http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/riverside\">Riverside Ice and Leisure</a> in Chelmsford, for instance, charges \u00a384 for a 12-week adults' course. </p> <p>Training can be performed in any non-flapping sports garments.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 5/10</h2> <p>Trampolinists jump up to 10m in the air. Beat that, basketball.</p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>Vera Atkinson, British Gymnastics:</strong> \"From early civilisations until the present day, this sport can be seen as a reflection of man's desire to defy gravity! At recreational level it is a source of great fun. The most modern trampoline can project a gymnast to such heights that the top stars can touch 10m-high ceilings and perform multiple somersaults with ease. As well as being a sport in its own right, it is widely recognised as a training tool for many other sports such as gymnastics, diving and freestyle skiing. It is also used by the Royal Air Force and by space agencies to acclimatise their pilots and astronauts to aerial activity.\"</p> <h2>Find out more</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.trampolining-online.co.uk/\">trampolining-online.co.uk</a> \u2013 an online resource with a club finder, competitions, coaches and retail section.</p> <h2>You may also like</h2> <p>Diving, gymnastics.</p> <h2>You might hate</h2> <p>Fencing, football.</p> <h2>Over to you</h2> <p>Are you a trampolinist?

  "<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has launched a review of anti-corruption controls in several of its publishing arms, including News International in London.</p> <p>Murdoch told News Corp staff in a memo on Wednesday that the company recently launched the probe as a \"forward-looking review\" to improve compliance with bribery laws.</p> <p>The media tycoon told staff that the anti-corruption review was \"not based on any suspicion of wrongdoing by any particular business unit or its personnel\".</p> <p>The memo described the review as focused on selected locations around the globe. One of these locations is London, where News International publishes the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times. It also published the now-closed News of the World.</p> <p>It is understood that News International's broad internal anti-corruption review began officially in July last year, when Tom Mockridge replaced Rebekah Brooks as chief executive.</p> <p>The probe accelerated when Imogen Haddon took over as chief compliance officer at News International in March. News Corp also appointed two New York-based compliance officers to oversee company-wide procedures. Gerson Zweifach, ex-senior executive vice-president and general counsel, is News Corp chief compliance officer and Lisa Fleischman, former associate general counsel, is deputy compliance officer.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police has arrested <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/07/news-international-chief-aggrieved-arrests\" title=\"\">14 current or former Sun journalists</a> as part of its ongoing investigation into inappropriate payments to police and public officials.</p> <p>Murdoch said in his memo to staff: \"As you are all aware, our company has been under intense scrutiny in the United Kingdom. I assured parliament and the Leveson inquiry that we would move quickly and aggressively to redress wrongdoing, co-operate with law enforcement officials and strengthen our compliance and ethics programme company-wide. With the support of our board of directors, I am pleased to tell you that we have made progress on each of these important steps.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We have already strengthened and expanded our anti-bribery training programmes. To ensure the effectiveness of our entire compliance and ethics programme, we have recently initiated a review of anti-corruption controls in selected locations around the globe. The purpose of this review is to test our current internal controls and identify ways in which we can enhance them.</p> <p>\"Let me emphasise that the review is not based on any suspicion of wrongdoing by any particular business unit or its personnel. Rather, it is a forward-looking review based on our commitment to improve anti-corruption controls throughout the company.\"</p> <p>Murdoch said the strengthening of News Corp's compliance procedures will take time and resources, but added that the cost of non-compliance are far more serious.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>For the past two nights, the suburbs of Amiens in northern France have been the scene of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/15/amiens-riots-french-youths-video\" title=\"\">violent clashes between police and local youths</a>. With the damage caused to public and private property already <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19261885\" title=\"\">estimated to be in the region of \u20ac1m</a>, this is being billed as the first real test of President Hollande's security credentials.</p> <p>The immediate response of the state has been to pour police reinforcements into Amiens in an attempt to quell the violence. This is both predictable and inevitable; law and order must be restored to the area. More interesting, however, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/14/french-city-amiens-riots\" title=\"\">Hollande's claim</a> that: \"Our priority is security, which means that the next budget will include additional resources for the gendarmerie and the police.\"</p> <p>Hollande's focus on additional police resources is, in many ways, a continuation of the policy pioneered by Nicolas Sarkozy throughout his political career. From his time as interior minister, Sarkozy always advocated a hardline approach to law and order. Indeed, for a man whose presidency was often marked by contradictory policies and positions, the theme of security was one of the few constants.</p> <p>Of course, there are political advantages to embracing security. During the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/06/france.focus?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">nationwide riots of 2005</a>, for example, Sarkozy's popularity was boosted as the public saw him as a man of action. Here was a politician ready to roll up his sleeves and tackle the problem of the banlieues. And his strategy was simple: present the riots in black and white. Sarkozy reduced the problem to the work of \"thugs\" and \"delinquents\" and claimed that a police crackdown would be the solution. The problem is, this approach simply doesn't work because the police are not the solution, they are part of the problem.</p> <p>Rioting in French suburbs is nothing new. The banlieues are characterised by poverty and exclusion and concentrate the most underprivileged members of French society. It is perhaps no surprise, then, that riots have erupted sporadically in these areas since the beginning of the 1980s. What is less well-known, however, is the role that the police play in fuelling unrest in the banlieues. It is no exaggeration to say that the police have been involved in the immediate causes of practically every episode of rioting in French suburbs since 1981. Consider some of the most recent examples of rioting in French suburbs. In 2005, the riots were sparked by the deaths of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/27/court-drops-france-riots-case-police\" title=\"\">Bouna Traor\u00e9 et Zyed Benna</a>, electrocuted as they <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/a-la-une/article/2005/12/07/le-dernier-jour-de-bouna-traore-et-zyed-benna_718481_3208.html\" title=\"\">fled from police in Clichy-sous-Bois</a>. In 2007, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/27/france.international\" title=\"\">riots erupted</a> when two youths from the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel died in a collision with a police car. These immediate causal links are simply the tip of the iceberg, the final incidents that cause an already-simmering situation to boil over.</p> <p>In the banlieues, the relationship between police and public is one built on mutual distrust, suspicion and, above all, conflict. Repeated identity checks, insults, provocation and constant suspicion have become part of the daily routine for the many young people who live in these areas. In the tough street culture of the suburbs, there are even stories (verified by police officers) of officers challenging local youths to one-on-one fights in a test of manhood.</p> <p>Of course, life in the banlieues is no picnic for the police. The French system has a particular tradition of sending newly commissioned officers to the banlieues for a baptism of fire of sorts. With their experience of the suburbs often limited to the sensationalist reports of the media, these officers are understandably fearful of an aspect of French society they do not really understand. Unfortunately, their response in this context is often an aggressive one as they seek to both hide their fear and impose their authority. As a result, police-public relations in the banlieues represent, at best, a destructive spiral where the young people feel persecuted by police, while police officers, fearful of the potential for violence, are quick to resort to more forceful methods.</p> <p>In this context, Hollande should be wary of embracing security as the solution to the problems of the banlieues. Police can be part of the long-term solution, but only if the current trajectory of police-public relations is reversed. The French government needs to look closely at how the suburbs are policed rather than how many officers can be stationed there. The \"community police\" model that was abolished by Sarkozy in 2003 could perhaps serve as a starting point. This model has seen a certain measure of success in the UK and even Sarkozy finally recognised its value when he established his own, watered-down version in 2009.</p> <p>Hollande and the banlieues are at a turning point. If he embraces security and continues on the path of his predecessor, the suburbs will erupt again. However, if the president and his government make an effort to engage with the issues underlying the riots, not least the matter of policing, the process of reducing the gap that separates the banlieues from mainstream society can finally begin.</p>",

At least they say they're brothers, in the same way that Ramones said they were brothers. They're based in London but resemble a French dance act worshipping at the altar of degenerate <a href=\"http://www.timeoutdubai.com/images/content/fall_out_boy__justice/innerbig/justice_1_innerbig.jpg\" title=\"\">US rocker chic</a> \u2013 in the video to their song Y.O.U.T.H C.L.U.B, they look like Justice pretending to be the Strokes.</p> <p>They have supported Mark Ronson, TV on the Radio, Hurts and Boy George, the latter two allowing us to label them synth-glam. Is there a market for synth-glam? Maybe, maybe not. But all credit to Tiger Love for merging those two genres \u2013 the electro bop of the former and the primitive stomp of the latter \u2013 and not making a pig's ear of it. In fact, they create something quite attractive, even if it's not the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKgGfiOpojc\" title=\"\">Tiger Feet</a> meets Love Action amalgam of our wildest fantasies, and even if the singer's needling, wheedling whine suggests his heart's not totally in it. We can't help sensing our old friend irony is being employed by Tiger Love to distance themselves from it all, just in case it fails to catch on.</p> <p>Then again, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a4gyJsY0mc\" title=\"\">Danger!

Memorable hook, though.

Either do this kind of music or don't. Don't be embarrassed about it otherwise people will be embarrassed to buy it. That's our tip of the day. Pussy Cocaine's title is never going to work on daytime radio so what is it Tiger Love are seeking? The approbation of the druggy demimonde? Is there a druggy demimonde?</p> <p>Ultimately they feel like a slacker indie band trying synth-pop out for size and not being sure if it fits. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz5Nak3wqtY\" title=\"\">Gio Gio</a>'s video attempts to capture or critique the high life with its sexy models and references to London-New-York-Paris-Berlin alluding to the glamour of European travel, the way M did centuries ago on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HaAOCGb3bw\" title=\"\">Pop Musik</a> or Heaven 17 did circa <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/nov/18/synth-pop-80s-omd-heaven17\" title=\"\">Penthouse &amp; Pavement</a>.

  "<p>Two years ago, the old city in Srinagar was the sort of place police would only venture into wearing body armour. A stronghold for violent separatists agitating for an independent Kashmir, it was at the centre of uprisings that left more than 100 people dead, buried along with dreams of peace in the mountainous north-Indian region.</p> <p>How quickly things change. This week, carefree tourists lined up in the same streets for barbecued mutton tikka and steaming plates of rogan josh. The Nowhatta mosque, where in the summer of 2010 youths would gather after Friday prayers to lob stones at the security forces (an episode commemorated in graffiti on a nearby wall declaring the area Srinagar's Gaza Strip), is to become a stop-off on an <a href=\"http://www.indianexpress.com/news/valley-tourism-advances-into-separatist-hotbeds/965059/\" title=\"\">official walking tour</a> focused on heritage, crafts and markets.</p> <p>Down by Dal lake, houseboats like the one in which George Harrison once stayed have been booked out months in advance. In the stunning mughal gardens lining the lake's green slopes, visitors can have their picture taken against one of Asia's prettiest backdrops. Until the snow melted, the ski resorts in nearby Gulmarg were packed with rich Russians, too.</p> <p>In 2002, just over 27,000 tourists dared to visit the Kashmir Valley,<br>frightened off by the anti-Indian insurgency, which has claimed up to<br>70,000 lives since erupting in 1989. So far this year, according to<br>official figures, the area has received almost one million<br>holidaymakers \u2013 more than 23,000 of them from outside India.</p> <p>But fewer than 150 Britons were among them \u2013 largely because the UK's Foreign Office refuses to amend its somewhat hair-raising <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/asia-oceania/india/\" title=\"\">advice</a>, which deters most travellers by providing a list of recent security incidents in the region, including two grenade attacks in the past fortnight. \"Be aware that the level of consular assistance that we can provide in Jammu and Kashmir is extremely limited,\" reads the warning.</p> <p>Omar Abdullah, the state's Essex-born chief minister, has lobbied the British high commission in Delhi to relax the guidelines, but to no avail.</p> <p>\"It's a source of frustration,\" admitted the 42-year-old, who has been in charge of India's most sensitive state since the start of 2009. \"Today, unfortunately, as a result of that travel advisory, people's insurance is null and void when they visit here. The moment that happens, then obviously nobody's going to visit.\"</p> <p>\"When did you last hear of a foreign tourist being targeted here?\" he asked the Guardian in an interview at his residence in Srinagar, the state's summer capital, on Tuesday. The last publicised case of foreign tourists being murdered in J&amp;K was in 1995, when six westerners including two Britons were kidnapped by Al-Faran, a Kashmiri militant Islamist group. Only one escaped with his life.</p> <p>\"You've had British citizens killed more recently in countries that you still haven't stopped people from visiting. I mean, how many British citizens did you lose in 9/11? Did you stop people from visiting New York? You've lost them in Spain, in Bali, tell me where you haven't lost them,\" said Abdullah.</p> <p>\"We've lost Indians in London. There is still a possibility that al-Qaida could do something stupid like they have done in the past, but we haven't stopped Indians from travelling to London. There is no reason to single out Jammu and Kashmir, or even Srinagar, as an unsafe destination.\"</p> <p>Germany relaxed its guidelines for those thinking of travelling to the region last year. \"Foreigners are generally not direct targets of clashes,\" counselled Germany's amended advice. At the time, it was viewed by many outsiders as a bold move, coming less than a year after the 2010 disturbances finally died down.</p> <p>A nationwide bank holiday on Wednesday marked 65 years of Indian independence \u2013 in the past, a day fraught with peril in a state where many do not feel part of the world's biggest democracy.</p> <p>Two years ago, Srinagar celebrated Independence Day under military rule, after Abdullah called in the army to quell protests for the first time in two decades. A strict curfew had been in place for several months and on the day itself a policeman <a href=\"http://www.indianexpress.com/news/shoe-hurled-towards-omar-at-iday-function-15-cops-suspended/660551/\" title=\"\">hurled a shoe at Abdullah</a> as he was taking the salute at the official function at the city's Bakshi&#xa0;stadium.</p> <p>At India's independence celebrations on Wednesday, the mood in the stadium was quite different. The empty seating suggested locals are some way off celebrating their state's role as part of modern India, but there was no trouble, either. Wearing a lambskin <em>karakul </em>cap and crisp white tunic, Abdullah stressed his commitment to tackling pockets of militancy, and saluted as bagpipe-playing troops marched by to a jaunty Urdu classic.</p> <p>Kashmir is becoming less militarised, he insisted the previous day. Forty military bunkers have been removed from Srinagar, he said, and a number of paramilitary battalions have been sent packing after proving surplus to requirements. He admitted the scale of the security presence in the state could be off-putting: gun-toting soldiers guard checkpoints and roadblocks on roads throughout the state, so much of which is still out of bounds behind barbed wire. But he insisted the oft-quoted figure of half a million soldiers \u2013 one for every 24 citizens \u2013 was wide of the mark.</p> <p>Yet Abdullah freely admitted this week that normality was \"quite a long way off\". In April, <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Omar-for-decreasing-footprints-of-security-forces-in-J-amp-K/Article1-841286.aspx\" title=\"\">he talked of withdrawing</a> the much-hated armed forces special powers act from certain areas. This controversial law gives unbridled powers to the security services, allowing them to kill with legal immunity. But after a number of militant incidents \u2013 such as on 31 July, when three people were injured, including a policeman, in two grenade attacks on a police station and market in Sopore \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/JAndK/Time-for-solution-not-mere-management-of-Kashmir-issue/Article1-913873.aspx\" title=\"\">this has been put on the backburner</a> .</p> <p>The chief minister insists tourists are safe in the state, \"as long as you take the sort of precautions that one normally would\". In other words, do not go trekking near the Line of Control, the sensitive de-facto border that separates the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of J&amp;K, and avoid flashpoint towns such as Sopore.</p> <p>Syed Ali Shah Geelani, leader of the pro-Kashmiri independence Hurriyat Conference party, disagrees bitterly with much of Abdullah's politics. But on the issue of tourism, the two are united. At the start of the summer season, <a href=\"http://www.huriyatconference.com/?JgBEAHUAcgBhAHQAaQBvAG4APQBXAEUATABDAE8ATQBFACAAVABPACAASwBBAFMASABNAEkAUgAgAE0AeQAgAGQAZQBhAHIAIAB0AG8AdQByAGkAcwB0ACAAYQBuAGQAIABwAGkAbABnAHIAaQBtAC0AMgA2AA%3D%3D-gqP4qPxjiQQ%3D\" title=\"\">Geelani wrote an open letter</a> to tourists and pilgrims that said: \"Whatever your faith, whatever language you speak and to whatever region you belong, we are bound by a common bond, the bond of humanity. You are our honoured guest, respecting and protecting guests is not only our moral obligation but article of faith.\"</p> <p>Some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place with a population suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems \u2013 and balk at politicians encouraging tourism when so many painful issues are left unaddressed, such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/21/kashmir-unmarked-graves-thousands-bodies\" title=\"\">discovery last year of thousands of unmarked graves</a>.</p> <p>But all the locals the Guardian spoke to in Srinagar this week were wholeheartedly in favour of tourism. Amjid Gulzar, 26, a geopolitics student whose family has run a tailoring business in the city since 1842, said Abdullah could search for truth and reconciliation as well as encouraging foreign visitors. \"He must do both; but without tourism, our economy will be in chaos,\" he said, adding that while he welcomed the million tourists who visited this year, Kashmir had to do more to attract big-spending visitors, especially foreigners.</p> <p>\"We need better infrastructure, better roads, reliable electricity. We need more for tourists to do in the evening \u2013 we don't even have one cinema in this city and there isn't enough for tourists to do after dark,\" he said.</p> <p>But will tourists feel welcome? A local&#xa0;Islamic group ruffled feathers in June after issuing a <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jamaat-e-islami-issues-dress-code-for-tourists-in-j&amp;%3Bk/1/203771.html\" title=\"\">\"dress code\" for foreign tourists</a>.</p> <p>Abdullah sighed at the mention of that furore. \"Nobody expects tourists to come here and adopt the burqa or the abaya, or to cover their faces. I think what they were talking about was short shorts and sleeveless vests, which even then would not be something that would attract too much attention \u2026 I think the basic point they were making was: be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately. I think that's common sense.\"</p> <p>Not, he insisted, that he was also urging foreign visitors to cover up. \"I believe that people should be free to choose what they like. I believe that neither our culture nor our religion is threatened just because somebody dresses differently. I should have enough strength in my own convictions not to be swayed by somebody just because they are dressed in less than I'm dressed in.\"</p> <p>Abdullah said he was on a tourism drive \"for no other reason than the fact that I need to stimulate the economy\". J&amp;K's finances are in a dire state after more than two decades of turmoil. The state receives just \u00a372m each year in taxes, and yet the salary bill for the 500,000 public employees is \u00a3155m, he said. Add a whopping pension liability plus millions on electricity subsidies and it is clear why he needs to find more funds, fast.</p> <p>For now, though, he is just cautiously pleased to see tourists back. \"I'm not suggesting that because we've had one million tourists here that it's a sign of normality,\" he said. \"But it gives me some satisfaction that people can come, have a nice time, and go&#xa0;back.\"</p> <h2>Who is Omar Abdullah?</h2> <p>The man tasked with bringing peace to Kashmir was not born in the troubled valley, but in Essex, in Westcliff-on-Sea in 1970. This quiet, measured man is the product of a love affair between an Indian doctor and a British nurse, who met working at a hospital in Great Yarmouth.</p> <p>But Omar Abdullah has long shaken off any Essex accent, his family having moved back to India when he was just five. His father, Farooq Abdullah, left the medical profession to move into politics, eventually serving as chief minister three times between 1982 and 2002. Omar's grandfather, Sheikh Abdullah, also held down the same job, spending time in jail for advocating Kashmiri independence.</p> <p>All three men have represented the National Conference, the largest political party in the northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. These days, the party campaigns for more devolved powers from Delhi rather than full-blown independence.</p> <p>When Omar took office in 2009, hopes were high that this political princeling could heal the ravaged state. But he disappointed many by failing to quell violent uprisings in the summers of 2009 and 2010.</p> <p>The jury is out on whether he can take any credit for the relative calm that has reigned in his state for the past two years. A modest pragmatist, he said this week that \"organisational fatigue\" had as much to do with the quiet than any of his measures. In other words: the militants and stone-throwers got fed up.</p> <p>He is similarly blunt about India's chances of becoming a superpower.</p> <p>\"Sending a mission to Mars is not a symbol of being a superpower, nor is being able to explode a nuclear bomb,\" he said, adding: \"While one would like to see that sort of ambition realised, there are far more important ambitions \u2013 clean drinking water, food, regular supply of electricity. Maybe more medals in the Olympics!\"</p> <p>Abdullah said he cheered along Team GB in London, as well as his national side, and says he likes British food (his mum, Mollie, does a \"mean Sunday roast\", apparently). He is a regular visitor to the country of his birth, relishing the freedom anonymity brings. In J&amp;K he is always flanked by bodyguards and travels in a convoy of at least nine cars. In Britain, he whizzes down the M25 all alone with no care in the world \u2013 probably listening to Abba, his favourite band. So strong is his love for the Swedish quartet that he happily admits to watching Mamma Mia in the West End. Four times.</p> <h2>What is Kashmir like to visit?</h2> <p>Stepping out of the terminal at Srinagar airport, it is clear you have not arrived in a typical tourist resort. Surrounded by camouflaged army barracks and guarded by an unusually large number of unsmiling armed soldiers, it feels more like a military installation than a tourist hotspot-in-waiting. The fact that draconian security measures will probably prevent your foreign mobile phone from working \u2013 or indeed any pay-as-you-go sim bought outside Jammu and Kashmir \u2013 adds to the unsettling feeling.</p> <p>Driving through the streets of the state's summer capital, police officers and paramilitaries sometimes seem to outnumber civilians; barbed wire still keeps people away from sensitive locations and manned military bunkers are still stationed at certain key junctions. But all this will be forgotten when you make it up to Pari Mahal, the terraced mughal garden on the Zabarwan mountain, and catch your first glimpse of lake Dal.</p> <p>This 7 square miles of freshwater was made famous in the 60s when George Harrison learned to play sitar on one of the hundreds of wooden houseboats bobbing around the shore. Still very popular today, these romantic vessels have names such as Helen of Troy or Mona Lisa and are responsible both for much of the lake's charm \u2013 and also its pollution. Green algae covers large swaths of the water, feeding off the untreated sewage dumped by all too many of the boats.</p> <p>Outside of Srinagar, the state of Jammu and Kashmir has much to offer.</p> <p>There is top-notch skiing at Gulmarg, a ski station reached by one of the world's highest cable cars. With six mountain ranges in the state, including the Great Himalayas, there is great hiking and trekking \u2013</p> <p>particularly in the high-altitude desert region of Ladakh in the north, which has a lunar quality. Motorcyclists love the road to the city of Leh, as it goes through many high passes including Fotu-La, which is 4,108 metres above sea level. Another summer highlight is Sonamarg, some 60 miles from Srinagar, a blooming valley full of alpine flowers, backed by snow-capped mountains.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 August 2012 to remove an incorrect figure for the number of tourists who visited the Kashmir Valley in 2008 and substitute a figure for 2002.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe one day Cesare Prandelli will be able to go about his business as coach of the Italian national team without the hint of a controversy bubbling beneath the surface. It's a long shot but you never know.</p> <p>The head coach of the <em>Azzurri</em> has this week been casting his eye over a squad filled with fresh faces. This is undoubtedly a key point in the Prandelli era as he rejuvenates the side that performed so admirably at the European Championship and seeks a solution to the gaping hole left by Andrea Pirlo. But as usual there were external matters to be discussed far beyond his hopes for the young debutants, with the attacking tyros Stephan El Shaarawy and Mattia Destro picked to start, and Marco Verratti, the playmaking youth lured out of Italy by the nouveau riche Paris St-Germain, eager to strut his stuff.</p> <p>The heavyweight drama of Antonio Conte's 10-month ban was inevitably on the agenda as Prandelli received the Italian media. A straight bat was in order as the debate thunders about whether the Juventus coach caught up in the latest match-fixing scandal should be training his team or not. \"Ten months without being able to sit on the bench is already a severe punishment. I do not see why he cannot train the team during the week,\" Prandelli mused calmly. Best not to be too extreme while the situation remains up in the air.</p> <p>The affair is due to rumble on in the coming days, as Conte has until next Monday \u2013 less than a week before Serie A's first round of matches \u2013 to launch his appeal against a ban that is likely to have a heavy impact on Juventus this season. As things stand, a member of Conte's technical staff and a former Juve team-mate from the 1990s, Massimo Carrera, will be the man in the dugout.</p> <p>It is an extraordinary situation. Conte is allowed control at the training ground, and can pick the team and choose strategies, but officially is allowed no contact with Carrera once a match is under way. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho famously showed there are ways and means of exerting your influence from afar if you are compelled to make your opinions known. But while it is one thing being removed from the conductor's plinth for a couple of matches, it is something else entirely to be exiled from running the show for an entire season.</p> <p>Carrera previously worked behind the scenes as a technical director overseeing Juve's youth, but he lacks experience at the sharp end he has been thrust towards. Conte proved himself a great coach last season and it is an enormous challenge for Carrera to seamlessly pick up the baton for each 90 minutes, however closely the two work throughout the week.</p> <p>\"I'll try to give advice to the players near the bench, but not on my own initiative, only as a consequence of what we do every day,\" said Carrera. \"Am I worried? I'll be sitting on the bench of the Italian champions, I defy anybody to be.\"</p> <p>There are a number of new players to integrate into the team \u2013 including the diminutive forward Sebastian Giovinco, in midfield the Chilean Mauricio Isla and the Ghanaian Kwadwo Asamoah, and potentially the young prospect Paul Pogba from Manchester United \u2013 and they are looking to make an impression. The <em>Bianconeri</em> are still on the hunt for a proven goalscorer, a marquee signing, but business is clearly not being helped by Conte's situation.</p> <p>Juve have been completely supportive of their head coach, and naturally feel aggrieved by the outcome of the investigation which charged him with failing to report alleged match-fixing when he was working for Siena in Serie B. The evidence of one man, the former Siena player Filippo Carobbio, was taken against the rest of the squad whose version of events contrasts with Carobbio's allegations. The club are hopeful of a positive appeal which would enable Conte to jump back into the dugout.</p> <p>Coming on the back of the <em>Calciopoli</em> scandal when Juventus were relegated, supporters of the Turin club have aired their conspiracy theories. If Conte's punishment is upheld, their rivals will again be handed a booster at a time when Juve are the <em>Scudetto</em> winners.</p> <p>But it may not be the usual suspects from Milan that are in the best position to challenge. They have clearly weakened, with the loss of two of their most important players. Selling Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva to PSG hurts, on top of the farewells bid by a number of name players over the summer. However lavishly the French club are currently bankrolled, it is impossible to sugarcoat the bitter reality that sees one of Italy's institutions lose top performers to the French league.</p> <p>As for Internazionale, it is difficult to guess what kind of a season awaits. Surely it will be less turbulent than last term, when they chopped and changed their way through three coaches. Inter are an enigma who haven't quite forgotten about Mourinho yet. They, too, are still searching for reinforcements.</p> <p>The most settled of the challengers are Napoli, who are almost as strong as last season despite having sold Ezequiel Lavezzi. They did show that mastering their nerves remains an achilles heel during an explosive Supercoppa defeat to Juventus which resulted in two players, and the coach Walter Mazzarri, being sent off. But Napoli, together with Roma, who are now guided by Zdenek Zeman, look well placed for an intriguing season.</p> <p>Down in the south of Italy, they will be watching the outcome of Conte's appeal almost as keenly as they will in the north.</p>",
  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Another of those games Britain made the mistake of giving the world, because it has barely won anything since it did, tennis is nevertheless enjoyed with undimmed cheer by swingers and rich teenagers nationwide every weekend. The modern, elite game \u2013 represented in the collective mind's eye by a super-slo-mo shot of Rafa Nadal gurning as he plays a forehand \u2013 bears little resemblance to the floaty, matronly game of yore, in which the rackets were called racquets and were made of wood, and the aim seemed to be not to inconvenience your opponent overmuch by winning a point. Some relics remain, such as the use of \"love\" when what one really means is \"YOU'RE ON ZERO YOU LOSER\". Few people know that the umpire's call \"deuce\" was once preceded by the words \"what the\". It's <em>true</em>. How dare you.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>Two or four players face each other at either end of a 78ft court, divided in half by a net that stands at 3ft 6in by the posts and 3ft in the centre. The width is 27ft for singles and 36ft for doubles. The players attempt to strike a hollow rubber ball over the net so that it bounces first on the opposite side. Failure to land the ball within the lines, or return the ball before it bounces twice, results in the loss of a point. </p> <p>A \"game\" is won by the first player to score four points (designated, for some reason, 15, 30, 40 and game), with the proviso, as in most racket games, that the winner must achieve a lead of two clear points. If the players are tied on 40-40 (\"deuce\"), then a player must first gain a point \"advantage\" before winning the game. A serve usually takes the form of an overhand smash into the diagonally opposite service box, with the server switching sides each time.</p> <p>A \"set\" is won by the first to six games, with two clear games required. Matches are usually best of three, except in male grand slams, when they're best of five. Thankfully the winner doesn't need two clear sets or we'd be here all bloody year.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>Tennis, requiring both sprint fitness, agility and endurance, is a tremendous all-round workout, strengthening both arms and legs. The club side of things can be fantastic in social terms.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>As with so much sports equipment, the cost of a racket really depends on your budget, but I personally wouldn't spend less than \u00a330. Try to buy a recognised make. It's worth investing in a fresh grip that will mould to your hand \u2013 the ones that come with the rackets tend to be a bit threadbare. A few hours of playing shots can be quite hard on unaccustomed hands, so expect a few blisters at first. Any tennis club worth its slightly supercilious code of conduct will demand proper tennis shoes with non-marking soles. A decent pair will cost you \u00a330 at least. Whites are sometimes required.</p> <p>The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) has provided this great <a href=\"http://www.lta.org.uk/Search/Find-A-Tennis-Court/?l=Wimbledon\">court finder</a>.

  "<p>Hilary Mantel, winner of the 2009 Man Booker prize for her novel Wolf Hall, and last month longlisted again for its sequel, has fuelled the debate about the literary claims of historical fiction by arguing that characterisation in historical novels, \"even very good historical novels\", is \"often two-dimensional\".</p> <p>She told the audience at the <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Edinburgh international book festival</a>: \"It's a big ask, to give the reader all the background information and all the foreground information and make the characters work as well.\" She said in her own books, \"what I am trying to do is to write as I would in any other novel, so that it has a literary quality as well as, I hope, a historical quality\".</p> <p>She added: \"I don't see why you should compromise. In writing a historical novel you use all the tricks you have learned on diverse subject matter and use all the techniques you bring to novels of contemporary life.\"</p> <p>Mantel, making a rare public appearance in a year when fragile health has limited her engagements, was speaking about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/bring-up-the-bodies-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\">Bring Up the Bodies</a>, the second book in her projected trilogy about the 16th-century politician Thomas Cromwell, who started as \"a blacksmith's son, and rose to be Earl of Essex, Henry VIII's right-hand man, and minister of everything\" \u2013 before ending up on the scaffold.</p> <p>Over her career Mantel has executed numerous characters, including Marie-Antoinette and many other figures in her 1992 novel about the French revolution, A Place of Greater Safety; as well as Anne Boleyn and her supposed lovers in Bring Up the Bodies. \"I've marched a lot of people to the scaffold, and beheading seems to be my favourite sport,\" she said.</p> <p>Despite the inevitability of Cromwell's death, however, she said that \"in every scene, even the quiet ones, I try to create turning points, multiple turning points. So the reader knows how it's going to turn out, but the reader's expectation of how and why is constantly challenged.\"</p> <p>Her aim was to place the reader in \"that time and that place, putting you into Henry's entourage. The essence of the thing is not to judge with hindsight, not to pass judgment from the lofty perch of the 21st century when we know what happened. It's to be there with them in that hunting party at Wolf Hall, moving forward with imperfect information and perhaps wrong expectations, but in any case moving forward into a future that is not predetermined, but where chance and hazard will play a terrific role.\"</p> <p>To illuminate her technique she pointed to the scene, early in Bring Up the Bodies, in which Cromwell, from a window, watches Jane Seymour walking with Henry in the garden of Wolf Hall. Cromwell does not realise it, but the king is falling in love. Cromwell regards them through \"the wobble in the glass\" \u2013 the uneven Tudor glazing of the window. At times he cannot see precisely what is going on; nor can he hear them. This scene, said Mantel, is a hint about the nature of the book. \"People are in your sightline one minute and then they bob out of it. And then there's the wobble in the glass, and you have to change your position to try to follow them.\" A romantic novel, she said, would be quite different, would put you there in the garden, with Jane, and with perfect access to her feelings.</p> <p>There is a Shakespearean quality to Mantel's writing: the mixture of low and high discourse, the political and historical setting, her theme of the rise and fall of great men. She revealed how all her writing, in her view, can be traced back to one single scene in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/JC_Navigator/JC_3_2.html#speech30\" title=\"\">act three, scene two</a> \u2013 in which Mark Antony speaks over the dictator's body, saying: \"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; /I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\"</p> <p>\"I came to Shakespeare very early,\" said Mantel. \"When I was about eight I found somewhere a black, grimy, ancient-looking book called Steps To Literature: Book Five. And in it there was a piece of Shakespeare, an extract from Julius Caesar \u2026 The crowd has been on the side of the conspirators and Brutus, but Antony, by a feat of rhetoric, turns them around so that they become not a crowd but a mob and they are hunting for the conspirators through Rome. And in my beautiful simplicity I thought this scene was the complete works of Shakespeare, which I had heard mentioned with reverence.</p> <p>\"Everything I have done is somehow wrapped into that scene. I have been concerned with revolution, with persuasion, with rhetoric, with the point where a crowd turns into a mob; in a larger sense, with the moment when one thing turns into another, whether a ghost into a solid person or a riot into a revolution. Everything, it seems to me, is in this scene.\"</p> <p>She also spoke about the novel she is working on now, The Mirror and the Light, which will complete the trilogy and, inevitably, culminate in Cromwell's execution. It will end, she said, with a scene mirroring the opening paragraphs of Wolf Hall, in which the young Cromwell is kicked half to death, in the mud of Putney, by his brutish father.</p> <p>\"When the first line and the picture of the 15-year-old Thomas Cromwell came into my mind, lying on the ground in his own blood, thinking that his father is going kill him; thinking that he is going to die at any minute, and hearing the voice of his father sneering at him, 'So now get up,' my mind immediately flew to what would be the end of the project.</p> <p>\"My idea is that probably the voice that says 'So now get up' is in his own ear again, and with the fading of Cromwell's consciousness the project becomes extinct. It is done.\"</p>",
  "<p>Admissions tutors say the same four questions come up again and again on the Clearing hotline. So save time and avoid looking unprepared or ignorant by checking these points first:</p> <h2><strong>\"Can you just tell me what&#xa0;courses you still have places&#xa0;left on?\"</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>\"Do your research early before calling,\" says Karen Pichlmann, head of admissions at Bournemouth University. \"Check Ucas, university websites and quality newspapers to find out which courses are available. Then decide which ones you are interested in, and look on universities' websites to find out more information about the courses. It is a really big decision, so do your research first.\"</p> <h2><strong>I haven't been accepted on to your course; please can you&#xa0;reconsider?</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>\"If you have been unsuccessful in getting your first or second place, it will be because you have not met the conditions of your offer,\" says Pichlmann. \"Universities will not have taken this decision lightly and it is very unlikely this decision can be reversed. Try to view this as an opportunity to see what other courses are available in Clearing \u2013 universities you disregarded because their entry requirements were too high may still have places and have dropped their tariff points.\"</p> <h2><strong>I've got such-and-such points. What course can I go&#xa0;on?\"</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Don't let these words pass your lips \u2013 they're hardly the best way to tell the person on the end of the Clearing phone \u2013 whose absolute, undying passion is probably for their course \u2013 that you're keen and interested in their course. Instead, you'll sound desperate. Avoid.</p> <h2><strong>\"If this course is in Clearing, does that mean it's a bad/unpopular course?\"</strong></h2> <p>Unlikely. \"Each university will have a target intake, and many use Clearing as a way to attract high-calibre students later in the application cycle,\" says Nic Pike, head of admissions at the University of Surrey. Nicola Miller, of London South Bank University, agrees. \"A common concern is that courses in Clearing are less desirable, but student number controls mean that Clearing has become very different in recent years.\" Often, it's just a way to even out supply and demand and help students who applied after the Ucas deadline, didn't apply at all, or have changed their mind to go to university in September rather than waiting another year.</p> <p>If you have questions about Clearing join our Q&amp;A today (16 August) from 2-5pm and get advice from our Ucas expert at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/students\">guardian.co.uk/students</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394753651\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/5/22/1337679637344/Guardian-students-sign-up-001.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian students sign up banner\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian students sign up banner</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>I am writing this in the grips of a profound headache, largely brought on by my stumbling efforts to get a grip on where we are with our economies.</p> <p>If our global economy were a commercial aircraft, and I one of the pilots, the entire instrument panel would be covered in flashing lights. But instead of sounding steady alarms, most would be stuttering on and off in apparently random patterns, making coherent responses very difficult. And that mental image had me racing back to the inquiry report on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447\" title=\"\">Air France 447</a>, which disappeared en route from Rio de Janeiro to Charles de Gaulle on 1 June 2009.</p> <p>Apart from routine fears of flying, those boarding the Airbus A330 would have had no reason to expect anything untoward. But, in the worst accident in French aviation history, the plane fell out of the sky into the Atlantic, killing all 228 people aboard. The causes were a mystery for air crash investigators, though early suspicions focused on the possible icing up of the critical airspeed monitoring devices called pitot tubes. It took Herculean efforts to retrieve the black boxes, but they provided a much clearer idea of what had gone so dramatically wrong.</p> <p>The final inquiry report, published last month, points to many interlinked contributory factors. The first was that the pilot tubes had iced up, robbing the automatic pilot of vital information. So the autopilot disconnected itself, and a pilot took over. At this point, due to lack of relevant training, he did precisely the wrong thing \u2013 pulling the nose up when it should have been pushed down to prevent a stall.</p> <p>The crew then found themselves in a position where their instruments were giving misleading information, where the autopilot was making assumptions based on software rather than reality, and the aircraft had its nose pointing upwards when it was actually in free-fall.</p> <p>It isn't hard to see parallels with those guiding our economies today, both in terms of the imminent danger of financial stalling and of the longer-term risks posed by climate change and the destabilisation of the biosphere. Again, we are feeding all sorts of assumptions into our economic and commercial autopilots \u2013 some accurate, some not.</p> <p>And even when things seem moderately stable, market autopilots can go berserk; think of the recent runaway trading by the Knight Capital Group's algorithms <a href=\"http://articles.marketwatch.com/2012-08-14/industries/33191162_1_knight-shares-preopen-trade-market\" title=\"\">which wiped away three-quarters of the firm's equity value</a> almost overnight.</p> <p>Interesting, then, to see US Securities and Exchange Commission chair, <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/2012-151.htm\" title=\"\">Mary Schapiro</a>, insisting that the use of computers is now a fact of life, that accidents happen, and that previous measures (including so-called market circuit-breakers) adopted in the wake of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash\" title=\"\">so-called Flash Crash</a> helped moderate the scale of the Knight Capital meltdown.</p> <p>A different take comes from John Fullerton of the Capital Institute, in his reflections on the <a href=\"http://www.capitalinstitute.org/blog/good-knight-htf\" title=\"\">wider implications</a> of Knight's \"near-death experience\".</p> <p>One book in my must-read-soon stack is <a href=\"http://www.scottpattersonreports.com/books/dark-pools/\" title=\"\">Dark Pools</a>, by Wall Street Journal reporter Scott Patterson, exploring the implications of the privately owned, lightly regulated exchanges \"where artificially intelligent machines now trade vast sums of money behind closed doors.\"</p> <p>In their attempts to build \"robot versions of Warren Buffett,\" the financial whizzkids at the centre of this story are creating an economic mechanism that will be very hard for humans to understand, let alone control.</p> <p>Now pull back and take a look at some wider defects in our market systems. Another reason for my headache was an opinion piece by long-term investor Jeremy Grantham in <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f2f7fae-e531-11e1-8ac0-00144feab49a.html\" title=\"\">The Financial Times</a>, arguing that the worst US drought in half a century means that we now are \"in the midst of a global food crisis.\" The resolution of this crisis, he argues, should not be left to \"cowboy capitalists\".</p> <p>Certainly, anyone digging into the growing (and often pernicious) links between energy security, food security, water security and climate security will sense, as I outlined last year on this website, that the challenge we now face has many of the characteristics of a global <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/systemic-change-food-security\" title=\"\">Rubik's Cube</a>. In this context, our traditional assumptions and algorithms, whether we play them through direct or artificial forms of intelligence, are profoundly unfit for purpose.</p> <p>Grantham notes that, \"all our food and resource problems could be handled easily if we were the 'homo economicus' of economic theory \u2013 well-informed, rational and incorruptible.\" Most estimates of future market outcomes, he warns, \"are based on that assumption. But it just isn't so. Sadly, we are easily manipulated by vested interests, we passionately prefer good news to bad, we are more short-sighted than we think we are, and we are all too corruptible.\"</p> <p>It was an odd twist in the AF447 saga that the wreckage was tracked down by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI). I visited WHOI on Cape Cod in 2003 to be briefed on various aspects of climate change \u2013 the subject of <a href=\"http://www.johnelkington.com/weblog/2003_09_01_arc.html\" title=\"\">my first-ever blog</a>. I emerged with my knees knocking at the nature and scale of the challenges we face. Yet the same country that has funded WHOI's work, is considering a vice-presidential candidate (or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3aHmcAoIU\" title=\"\">presidential</a>, if you listen to Mitt Romney) who has argued that global warming is an illusion.

Not on a plane, but on Planet 447 \u2013 headed smack into a zone of extreme turbulence. We are using autopilot systems (among them current forms of economics, valuation and accounting) that are full of assumptions way past their shred-by dates. Some of us are hauling back on the controls, thinking that's the right thing to do, despite the alarms sounding all around.</p> <p>And now the planet's most powerful nation is considering putting someone in the co-pilot's seat who seems wilfully blind to at least one key element of global reality. \"Fasten your safety belts,\" some might advise, but I'm not sure that's going to help much.</p> <p><em>John Elkington is executive chair of </em><a href=\"http://www.volans.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Volans</em></a><em> and non-executive director at </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/\" title=\"\"><em>SustainAbility</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Where does great achievement come from? In the minutes before <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19200173\" title=\"\">Bolt, Blake and Weir</a> of Jamaica took 1-2-3 in the 200m, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmvtwjqYZcY&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">BBC played a short film</a> which suggested that black athletes won medals because of \"west African genes\" and the unnatural selection of the \"fittest\" by plantation slavery. If either of these were sufficient explanation then such centres of new world slavery as Haiti and Brazil would also be athletic superpowers, as would Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Angola, and the Congo from which most slaves came, and the United States itself would not be increasingly pushed into the shade. Genes may help, but only one part of the African diaspora has won disproportionately in Beijing in 2008 and London in 2012.</p> <p>The Caribbean islands (including Cuba, which won more than any South American country), won 14 gold medals in London, placing it behind only the US, China, UK, and Russia (with other golds won for France, the UK and the US by Caribbean athletes). With a population of less than 20 million, and a combined GDP lower than Portugal's, the Caribbean dominated both the 100m and 200m in London as in Beijing. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/06/london-2012-400m-kirani-james?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Kirani James of Grenada</a> (population 100,000) took the 400m, while the Bahamas defeated the United States, which had 1,000 times its population, in the men's 4x400m metre relay. Other medals came in shooting, javelin, wrestling, taekwondo, and judo. This key to this extraordinary overperformance relative to population, compared even with other communities of African descent, is not genetics but social democratic politics.</p> <p>The Caribbean was the third-world laboratory in which reformist and revolutionary socialism had its most extensive 20th-century play. In the decades after slavery ended, Britain's West Indian colonies had been cruel places for its black and poor subjects: in Barbados in 1919, for example, only two out of every three babies born lived to the age of one, while life expectancy was under 40.</p> <p>In 1942, the governor complained to London that wartime propaganda fell on deaf ears as \"no recital of horrors sustained in occupied countries will convince [the West Indian poor] that its present lot could be worse\". But a wave of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_West_Indian_labour_unrest_of_1934%E2%80%931939\" title=\"\">strikes and riots in the 1930s</a> launched trade unions and political parties around the Caribbean. Britain's concession of universal suffrage in the 1940s and early 1950s produced popular governments across the region which created modern tax systems, protected trade unions which won better wages, and invested over decades in free or near-to-free health and education. The consequences of this were dramatic improvements in health, life expectancy, and physical stature. Sports facilities, like theatres and music education, became things to which the poorest people now had access. As a result, the Caribbean in the late 20th-century became perhaps the best place in the world to be born poor and black.</p> <p>Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake, the Jamaican and Trinidad quartets in the 4x100m relay, and the Bahamas and Trinidad quartets in the 4x400m, are the product of three generations of improved social conditions. They are certainly emblems of what the Caribbean has made of half a century of political independence. But they symbolise, as much as the NHS beds of the opening ceremony, what welfarist democracy achieved in the 20th century. Societies that make the needs of poor into their priority make possible the fullest realisation of human potentials. Individuals may achieve great things, but only on the basis of collective investment. This should be the lesson Team GB takes from the London Olympics.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What does your present job at Surrey county council involve?</strong></p> <p>I'm strategic director for customers and communities, which covers services from fire and adult and community learning to libraries and trading standards. All of this involves working very closely with a range of partners.</p> <p><strong>You're going to be interim chief executive of Mole Valley district council in addition to your role at Surrey \u2013 how will you manage your time?</strong></p> <p>I'm going to spend three days a week at Mole Valley. I won't be able to manage all of my existing roles so my responsibility for fire and rescue and culture services will pass on to other directors. Some of my other responsibilities, such as for community safety and partnership working, will work well across both jobs. Trading standards, for example, is already something we do in partnership with Mole Valley. At this moment in time, it's the right move and so we said 'let's give this a go'.</p> <p><strong>You won't be receiving any extra pay \u2013 why did you want to do it?</strong></p> <p>We work very closely with Mole Valley, and each Surrey director has links with district councils, so for me it's a logical extension of what we do already. It's a model we want to build on; closer joined up working, better value for the councils and residents. Personally, it's an exciting added dimension to my role and it caught my imagination. It's a fantastic opportunity at this point in my career \u2013 and I like a challenge.</p> <p><strong>Are there any issues you forsee in the plan?</strong></p> <p>Surrey is an upper tier authority so it has different responsibilities to Mole Valley, which has responsibilities for housing benefit for example, that I'm going to have to get to grips with. It's a different realm, but it all works well together. In Surrey, working to support families meant liaising with the district council, so now it makes sense that I have a foot in both camps. I've worked on a broad church of projects and picking up new things quickly is a strength.</p> <p>Both organisations will remain independent, but teams on both councils have been very supportive \u2013 it's not about a takeover. It's an interim role, so we'll go through priorities and out of that we'll develop a plan.</p> <p><strong>Have you always worked in local government?</strong></p> <p>Apart from a couple of years running an equestrian yard, I've always worked in local government. My background is in trading standards.</p> <p><strong>What have you learnt about leadership through your career?</strong></p> <p>I'm a people-orientated person and listening to staff is important, as is taking them with you. You need to be firm but fair and be willing to take difficult decisions. You're never going to please everyone but earning trust is hugely important.</p> <p><strong>You oversaw the shared initiative that brought the Olympic cycle races to Surrey \u2013 are you doing more on this?</strong></p> <p>We're already working on the legacy. In September we have the Tour of Britain and the RideLondon cycling festival. We worked so closely with police and health teams \u2013 it took a considerable amount of engagement. It's absolutely a launch pad for more things \u2013 and far more than just cycling \u2013 whether business, sporting or culture.</p> <p><strong>How do you relax?</strong></p> <p>I have four horses and they play a big, big part of my life. They keep me sane.

  "<p>It started as a touching, light-hearted gesture of pride and congratulation, but Royal Mail's decision to paint postboxes gold in honour of medal-winning Olympians in their home towns is in danger of veering out of control as members of the public begin taking matters into their own hands.</p> <p>A bar and restaurant owner was arrested in Lymington, Hampshire, after spraypainting a Royal Mail postbox in honour of Ben Ainslie, who lives in the town. Rob Smith, 51, painted the postbox in Lymington High Street on his way home from work at about 1.30am. He was arrested by police on suspicion of criminal damage and later released on bail.</p> <p>Royal Mail decided Ainslie's golden postbox would be placed in Cornwall where he grew up and learned to sail, much to the chagrin of Lymington residents.</p> <p>\"When they said they weren't going to paint anything in Lymington, I just thought: this is madness,\" Smith told the BBC. \"He's lived here for around 15 years. All of Lymington believes that the Post Office made the wrong choice in painting one down in Cornwall. Give him two.\"</p> <p>A Royal Mail spokeswoman, Val Bodden, said: \"Royal Mail has been delighted to mark the achievement of Team GB athletes winning gold medals at London 2012.</p> <p>\"Each of these gold medal winners had a postbox painted gold in the local community with which they have a close association. This could be where they were born, where they grew up or where they presently live and we looked at all these factors before reaching a considered choice.\"</p> <p>Ainslie has expressed support for the self-proclaimed \"passionate sportsman\" Smith, calling him a \"legend of Lymington\", while a Facebook campaign backing a golden postbox in Lymington has attracted more than 1,700 supporters.</p> <p>When asked about the postbox at a homecoming event at the Royal Lymington Yacht Club, Ainslie said: \"Obviously the police didn't really like it but it's really nice the Olympics generated that kind of excitement in the nation. To hear the stories of support around the nation made such a huge difference to us as competitors, it was really very, very special.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile in Doddington, Lincolnshire, hockey fans painted a postbox bronze in honour of the British women's hockey team, who beat New Zealand 3-1 in the third-place play-off.</p> <p>The GB midfielder Georgie Twigg comes from the town and retweeted the picture of the postbox to her followers on Twitter.</p> <p>A Royal Mail spokeswoman said: \"We understand the sentiment and congratulate the women's hockey team on their achievement. However, we'd rather people left the painting of postboxes to us. We are liaising with our engineers to ensure that it is repainted red as soon as possible.\"</p>",
  "<p>Alex Falconer, who has died from cancer at the age of 72, was a stalwart of the traditional Labour left who spent 15 years as a member of the European parliament, largely devoted to exposing the perceived failings of the European Union and all its works.</p> <p>Having gained the Mid Scotland and Fife seat from the Conservatives in 1984, Falconer's devotion to causes that were specific to that area, particularly the fate of the mining industry, made him a respected local figure. On one occasion, he held up a banner in support of striking miners while Margaret Thatcher was addressing the European parliament.</p> <p>He also campaigned extensively on compensation for sufferers from pleural plaques, an industrial disease caused by exposure to asbestos. Falconer's efforts helped to ensure that this cause achieved a high profile in Scotland, with the result that there is now legislation there which does not apply to the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Although a strong supporter of Scottish devolution, Falconer was opposed to proportional representation which, he believed, would damage Labour's prospects of running the Scottish parliament \u2013 a view borne out by subsequent events. In the European context, the introduction of PR led to a Scotland-wide, multi-member constituency, breaking the local link. This coincided with Falconer's decision to retire in 1999.</p> <p>Falconer was passionately opposed to the rewriting of clause IV of the Labour constitution to redefine the aims of the party with less emphasis on nationalisation. He wrote in Tribune: \"The people who joined the Labour party to defend and advance our historic mission will continue to argue that this is best done on the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange. It is now the suitability of the forum (ie the Labour party) that is the subject of deliberation.\"</p> <p>When, in early 1995, an advertisement paid for by MEPs who supported retention of the old clause IV appeared in the Guardian, a meeting was arranged with Tony Blair. According to Alastair Campbell's account, Blair took the confrontation head-on: \"I could see the smug smiles disappearing from the small bunch of tankies who had had the idea for the scam in the first place. Alex Falconer who was the 'brains' behind it was marmalised.\"</p> <p>After the replacement of clause IV by a new form of wording, Falconer became a leading light in the Campaign for Socialism, which sought to keep its objectives alive. He was close to Gordon Brown throughout his political career and shared a constituency office with him in Inverkeithing, Fife. Brown this week described him as \"one of the most dedicated and committed trade unionists and campaigning politicians I have ever had the privilege to work with\".</p> <p>A native of Dundee, Falconer left school with no formal qualifications and went to work as a lodge boy in the city's Blackness foundry. On being made redundant, he joined the Royal Navy, in which he spent eight years. In 1969, he found employment as a lagger at the naval dockyard at Rosyth, where he soon became active in the Transport and General Workers' Union. This led him into Labour party activism as a TGWU delegate.</p> <p>In Strasbourg and Brussels, he formed part of a group, also including Stan Newens, Alf Lomas and Llew Smith, who saw themselves as basically anti-EU while seeking to improve the democratic accountability of the parliament. It made for an uncomfortable relationship with the party leadership, which was more concerned during that period with a modernising agenda that included establishing pro-European credentials.</p> <p>While an MEP, Falconer continued to be extremely active in domestic Scottish politics, generally in support of TGWU policy, which was heavily weighted towards devolution. The apparent rigidity of his political outlook contrasted with his kindly personal demeanour and underpinned a very genuine commitment to social justice and the welfare of his constituents.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Margaret, and their son and daughter.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Alexander Falconer, Labour politician and trade unionist, born 1 April 1940; died 12 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>Judges in Northern Ireland have banned the identification of alleged drug dealers because of fears the accused could become targets for an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/13/derry-city-of-culture-fear\" title=\"\">ongoing republican vigilante terror campaign in Derry</a>.</p> <p>One district judge in the city has already imposed an embargo on the media to prevent the naming of three men accused of possessing cannabis, in response to the threat from the vigilante group Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD).</p> <p>RAAD has now merged with the Real IRA, posing an even greater threat to those it labels \"antisocial elements\".</p> <p>In his ruling in Derry magistrates court on 6 August, Judge Barney McElholm said he was making the order under section 2 of the European convention on human rights, which protects the right to life.</p> <p>The Lord Chief Justice's Office in Northern Ireland has confirmed that judges in the province do have the power to prohibit the naming of suspects if revealing their identities potentially breached the provisions of section 2.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the lord chief justice said of McElholm's ruling: \"Anonymity orders are a matter of judicial discretion decided on a case-by-case basis depending on the facts in the matter.\"</p> <p>The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission also agreed that in certain circumstances the article on the right to life should guarantee suspects' anonymity even if that meant a ban on full open-court reporting in those cases.</p> <p>A spokesman for the commission said: \"A free media is vital for a healthy society. However, the right of journalistic freedom of expression is not absolute. Sometimes it needs to be restricted to protect the fundamental rights of others.</p> <p>\"In such cases the restriction must always be necessary and proportionate. In the situation of protecting the right to life, there is no doubt that cases may arise where a prohibition on the disclosure of identity would meet the requirements of the test. It is in this context that the actions of the court should be considered.\"</p> <p>As well as citing the convention, McElholm also quoted from rulings by the supreme court and the Northern Ireland court of appeal, which set out his power to make such an order.</p> <p>He said: \"The risk from certain criminal elements within our society is well known and without doubt they have made threats in the past.</p> <p>\"In fact, they have said on occasion they have made use of the court reports to get the identity of certain individuals.\"</p> <p>The judge said that in this particular case it was \"appropriate and right\" to make an anonymity order.</p> <p>During the hearing the public gallery was cleared and the defendants were referred to as AB, CD and EF. AB, 44, and CD, 21, are jointly charged with supplying cannabis, possession of the drug with intent to supply, and simple possession of the drug. EF, aged 30, faces two charges of possessing cannabis, two of possession with intent to supply, one of concealing criminal property, and driving offences.</p> <p>The charges relate to the seizure of cannabis with a street value of \u00a3150,000 in the Blackthorn Manor area of Derry's Waterside on 3 August. The men's lawyers argued that all three were afraid of certain people in the Derry area.</p> <p>In the same Derry courthouse the previous week, the extent of the RAAD terror campaign emerged during the trial of a man accused of being a member of the republican organisation.</p> <p>The court was told that Liam Martin McDonnell had been arrested and charged after blank-firing revolvers and four replica AK-47 rifles were seized during searches of his home. One of the weapons recovered on 12 July was adapted to fire ball-bearings, consistent with RAAD's method of punishment shootings, prosecutors said.</p> <p>McDonnell, 26, of Rinmore Drive in Creggan, is charged with possessing a firearm with intent and possession of articles for use in terrorism.</p> <p>McDonnell said he collected replica guns as a hobby, stressing that he never used them for illegal purposes. He also denied involvement with any illegal organisations.</p> <p>During his court appearance, a crown lawyer told the judge that between September 2008 and May 2012, RAAD had been involved in 73 paramilitary incidents in the city, in nearby Strabane and just over the border in Co Donegal. These include 30 shootings and one murder.</p> <p>Other attacks would include beatings and expulsions often backed up with the threat of shooting and even death.</p> <p>Last month the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/26/ira-northern-ireland-dissident-republican-groups\" title=\"\">Guardian received a statement</a> announcing that RAAD was being merged along with the Real IRA and several independent armed republican units into what was styled as a \"new IRA\" under a centralised command.</p>",
  "<p>There are hundreds of plays on offer at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburghfestival\" title=\"\">Edinburgh festival</a> this month but many of the dramas being played out in the city charge no admission and anticipate no five star reviews. The Edinburgh sheriff court in Chambers Street stands in the midst of much of the festival activity and many of the stories that unfold behind its doors are as strange and sad as any of the fictional offerings available nearby.</p> <p>In court seven, a 20-year-old man is accused of having spat at the security officer who was patrolling the touchline during the local derby between Hearts and Hibernian at Tynecastle last year. \"Had it been a jovial atmosphere?\" the spat-upon man is asked by the prosecution. \"No,\" he replies, firmly. One of his colleagues who saw the offending spittle flying through the air identifies the defendant, a Hibs fan. A police officer who had also observed the incident describes the event in greater detail: \"he tilted his head back to gain momentum. It was quite overt ... I saw him congratulate himself on the fact that he had spat on the back of [the security officer's] head.\"</p> <p>Two of the accused's relatives who were also at the game give evidence that they had not seen any spitting and that the atmosphere had been of \"good-natured fun\". The defendant pleads not guilty and says he had only spat once to clear his throat earlier in the game: \"I never projected it.\" The sheriff is not convinced and the young man, who has previous convictions for vandalism, is found guilty. A report will be prepared by social workers before sentence and he is banned from attending Hibs games in the interim.</p> <p>Another young man appears. He had been offering \"moral support\" to his sister-in-law in her flat during a visit by her landlord and his brother, who were declining to give her back her deposit now that she was leaving. The landlord had suggested that there was damage and there were nicotine stains on the ceiling. The accused is said to have told the landlord that he would need a coffin if he wasn't careful. He had then punched him, a fight had developed, the sister-in-law had picked up a brush handle. The accused claims that what he had actually said was \"hurry up or we'll all be in a coffin\" but he does not deny starting the fight. \"No drink was involved,\" says the prosecutor and adds: \"unusually for this court.\"</p> <p>A young woman, who has been quietly sobbing in her mother's arms outside the court, appears before the sheriff. She had been seen pushing people on the dance floor of a pub at 2.30 am and had then fought with the bouncers. She had drunk \"numerous glasses\" of wine.</p> <p>\"It's a very familiar story,\" the prosecutor tells the sheriff.</p> <p>\"You'll have heard it a thousand times.\" It is the young woman's first offence. She earns \u00a3300 a week and is ordered to pay \u00a3500 in fines and compensation at \u00a340 a week.</p> <p>A young Asian man appears. He and four or five other young Asians had been involved in a fight outside the Liquid Room night club with around 15 \"already heavily intoxicated\" white youths. One of those involved had said that the fight was not serious but \"just handbags.\"</p> <p>\"Handbags?\" asks the puzzled sheriff in what is almost a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyuoUwxCLMs\" title=\"\">Lady Bracknell moment</a> - The Importance of Being Earnest is on in the fringe. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/shortcuts/2012/jul/10/handbags-game-for-two-players\" title=\"\">It's just a phrase</a>, my lord,\" explains the prosecutor. The accused is fined \u00a3675 to be paid at \u00a380 a month.</p> <p>Drink and drugs seep through most of the offences. In May, the Scottish parliament passed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/24/scottish-parliament-cut-price-alcohol-clampdown\" title=\"\">Alcohol Minimum Pricing Bill</a> in response to the part that drink plays in so many crimes. According to the Scottish health minister, Nicola Sturgeon, half the prisoners in Scottish jails had been drunk at the time of their offence. Alcohol was involved in 70% of assault admissions to accident and emergency and in 14 out of 18 murders in Strathclyde in 2010.</p> <p>The way that trials are reported is high on the agenda in Scotland. Live updating of trials on Twitter was first allowed at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jan/05/tommy-sheridan-trial-blog\" title=\"\">perjury trial of the former MSP Tommy Sheridan</a> last year. Cameras were present in court for Lord Bracadale to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/david-gilroy-jailed-murder-suzanne-pilley\" title=\"\">sentence the murderer David Gilroy</a> this April and have been allowed, on occasion, in courts in Scotland since 1992, with the agreement of all parties. In October, the Scottish parliament will be discussing much of this as they debate \"the role of the the media in criminal trials.\"</p> <p>Outside the court, the festival fringe is in full swing. Among the offerings are a Murderthon and a play called Detention, which is a Hong Kong comedy rather than a sentence. And opposite the venue where that is showing, there is a chance for a bite at the Codfather's offering \"criminally good fish and chips.\"</p>",
  "<p>Harry Harrison, who has died aged 87, was a writer from the world of American comics and science-fiction magazines of the 1950s. An amazingly prolific author, who gradually took on more serious themes as he matured, Harrison is probably best known for the book that inspired the Hollywood film Soylent Green (1973). Directed by Richard Fleischer and starring Charlton Heston and Edward G Robinson, Soylent Green was an uncompromising view of a world a quarter of a century into the future, in which massive overpopulation has created a critical food shortage. The solution is an alleged soya/lentil substitute \u2013 the plot concerns the discovery of the true nature of the stuff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394760398\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345033344236/harry-harrison-obituary-001.jpg\" alt=\"harry harrison obituary\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat series, from 1961, ran to 12 titles</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The original novel was called Make Room! Make Room! (1966). Harrison said wryly that the film \"at times bore a faint resemblance to the book\". It was a serious, thoroughly researched novel, written at a time when there was little discussion of the population time-bomb. Although overpopulation was a common theme in far-future science fiction, Harrison's idea was to depict a near-future society (year 2000) that many of us, or our children, would live to see. It marked a change of direction for Harrison, although it was an early sign of a trend in his work that was not to emerge in full until some years later.</p> <p>His most popular and best-known work is contained in fast-moving parodies, homages or even straight reconstructions of traditional space-opera adventures. He wrote several named series of these: notably the Deathworld series (three titles, starting in 1960), the Stainless Steel Rat books (12 titles, from 1961), and the sequence of books about Bill, the Galactic Hero (seven titles, from 1965). These books all present interesting contradictions: while being exactly what they might superficially seem to be, unpretentious action novels with a strong streak of humour, they are also satirical, knowing, subversive, unapologetically anti-military, anti-authority and anti-violence. Harrison wrote such novels in the idiom of the politically conservative hack writer, but in reality he had a liberal conscience and a sharp awareness of the lack of literary values in so much of the SF he was parodying.</p> <p>He was born in Stamford, Connecticut, the only son of Henry Dempsey and his wife, Ria (n\u00e9e Kirjassoff). Dempsey changed his name to Harrison soon after Harry's birth, but the son did not find out until he applied for a passport, aged 30, that his own name was still Dempsey. He then changed his name legally to Harrison, but in later years sometimes used Hank Dempsey as a pseudonym.</p> <p>In 1943 he was drafted into the US Army Air Corps, where he became a sharpshooter, a military policeman, a gunnery instructor, and a specialist in the prototypes of computer-aided bomb-sights and gun turrets. One of his last literary projects was a novel based on this period. He was so bored during his service that he learned Esperanto \u2013 he was an active Esperantist for the rest of his life. But overall the army experience vested in him a hatred of the military that was to serve him well as a writer later on.</p> <p>After discharge he went to Hunter College in New York to study art. He became a student of the American painter John Blomshield, continuing to take private tuition from Blomshield after he finished college. By the end of the 1940s Harrison was running a small studio that specialised in selling illustrations to comics and science-fiction magazines. For years he thought of himself as a commercial artist rather than a writer. He then moved on to editing some of the magazines.</p> <p>As the market for comics began to shrink, and then expire, Harrison started writing for science-fiction magazines. The paltry financial rewards led him and his family (he married Joan Merkler in 1954) to want to move from New York. The chance came with what seemed at the time like a large payment from a magazine for his first full-length novel, Deathworld. He drove his family in an antiquated camper van to Mexico and remained there for a year.</p> <p>It was the first of many international moves, something that became characteristic. He went from Mexico to Britain, then to Italy, then to Denmark. He liked Denmark and stayed for seven years, seeing it as a perfect place to bring up his children, but eventually he realised that unless he made a conscious decision to leave, they could easily remain there for ever. The family moved back to the US, to San Diego, California, where he reckoned heating bills would be low, but by the mid-1970s he was back in the UK. He moved on to Ireland, where he and Joan settled for many years; because Harrison had an Irish grandparent, he was able to take out citizenship, and by taking full advantage of the Irish scheme for writers and other artists, he enjoyed tax-free status thereafter.</p> <p>A long association with the British writer Brian Aldiss allowed Harrison to express his deeper convictions about the way science-fiction literature was published, criticised and understood. In 1965 Harrison and Aldiss published the first issue (of two) of the world's first serious journal of SF criticism, SF Horizons. Together they edited many anthologies of short stories, each one illustrating the major themes of SF, and although not intended as critical apparatus the books were a way of delineating the unique material of the fantastic.</p> <p>As committed internationalists, the two men created World SF, an organisation of professionals intended to encourage and enhance the writing of non-anglophone SF. World SF was launched in 1979 in Dublin, with later meetings in countries including Sweden, Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia. The Harrison award was created to improve the international status of SF. As an editor he published the Nova series of original stories (1970-1975), and with Aldiss the anthologies Best SF and The Year's Best SF(1967-76).</p> <p>From the outside, the serious side of Harrison probably looked anomalous. For many years he remained a staunch supporter of and contributor to Analog, the SF magazine edited by John W Campbell, a doctrinaire editor who had no interest in literary values. And this was the period in which Harrison was publishing novels with titles such as Montezuma's Revenge (1972), A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah! (1972), Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers (1973), and a book about SF art called Great Balls of Fire (1977). But, as Harrison himself once said, irony comes in many forms.</p> <p>His seriousness was manifest in more intensely felt novels such as Captive Universe (1969 \u2013 a Book of the Month Club choice in the US), Skyfall (1976), Stonehenge (1983 \u2013 written with the academic Leon Stover) and the Eden series of books, starting with West of Eden (1984). One of his last projects was to write his autobiography.</p> <p>Harrison was an extremely popular figure in the SF world, renowned for being amiable, outspoken and endlessly amusing. His quickfire, machine-gun delivery of words was a delight to hear, and a reward to unravel: he was funny and self-aware, he enjoyed reporting the follies of others, he distrusted generals, prime ministers and tax officials with sardonic and cruel wit, and above all he made plain his acute intelligence and astonishing range of moral, ethical and literary sensibilities.</p> <p>Joan died in 2002, a devastating blow which led to Harrison's full-time return to Britain. Two children, Todd and Moira, survive him.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Henry Maxwell Harrison, science-fiction writer, born 12 March 1925; died 15 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>Charges of mistreating and neglecting patients with learning disabilities are to be laid against four health centre staff after a five-year inquiry during which two previous attempts to bring criminal proceedings have failed.</p> <p>Two men and two women will appear before magistrates in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, in August and September accused of the offences between 2005 and 2007 at the Solar Centre in St Catherine's hospital at Balby, Doncaster.</p> <p>They have been named as James Hinds and Susan Murphy, who will face the court on 28 August, and Julie Burge and Michael Barnard, who will appear on 10 September.</p> <p>Two members of staff at the NHS centre were sacked last year during the complex inquiry into claims of a threatening and harassing regime. None of those involved works there now. A blind patient in her 20s with cerebral palsy and epilepsy was said to have punched in the face among other alleged incidents.</p> <p>Compensation was paid to two former patients but two police inquiries failed to produce enough evidence to satisfy the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The original inquiry was reopened after an internal investigation by the Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber mental health NHS foundation trust, and its leader, then acting Detective Chief Inspector, Natalie Shaw, said in September last year: \"I can understand how disappointing and frustrating the decision not to prosecute will be for the victims and family members who have been involved.</p> <p>\"South Yorkshire police have thoroughly completed both investigations into the allegations, and we have utilised all the information, legislation and powers we have available to build a strong case. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, there is still insufficient evidence to meet the requirements to progress to a prosecution.\"</p> <p>The CPS announced the move after a third review of evidence involving 18 patients. Richard Hebbert, a lawyer in the complex casework unit for CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: \"I have today authorised South Yorkshire police to commence proceedings for a prosecution against four people relating to the ill-treatment and wilful neglect of patients receiving treatment for mental health disorders at the Solar Centre at St Catherine's hospital, Doncaster.</p> <p>\"They are James Hinds, with 14 charges, Susan Murphy with 13 charges, Julie Burge with three charges, and Michael Barnard with eight charges. All four were working at the Solar Centre at the time the offences are alleged to have occurred.</p> <p>\"A full review of all of the evidence in this case has been conducted and I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to prosecute.\"</p>",
  "<blockquote> \"You don't go out looking for a job dressed like that do ya, on a weekday?\" <br> \"Is this a \u2026 what day is this?\" </blockquote> <p>Jeffrey Lebowski didn't know what day it was. The Spin often knows the feeling. At the moment we're not sure what year it is. The state of English cricket leading up to Thursday's Test against South Africa is part 2012, part 1990s. If the Kevin Pietersen business is emphatically of its time, involving social networking and the confused entitlement of modern society, then the more important element of this week \u2013 England's need to win the final Test to square the series \u2013 feels like a throwback to the previous generation.</p> <p>It actually didn't happen as often as you might think, yet it's still evocative of those late 20th century days. England in disarray going into the final Test, the selectors making multiple changes and being slaughtered for the aesthetic vandalism of omitting Jack Russell and/or the specialist spinner. The most obvious reference point is 1994, against South Africa, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/12/the-spin-england-south-africa-1994\" title=\"\">but we covered that a few weeks ago</a>, and although we were tempted to reprint the whole thing and hope nobody noticed, we've always wanted to bask in the victory over West Indies in 1991, one of the most life-affirming Test matches of modern times. There were no tweets, no texts, no YouTube interviews and no parody accounts \u2013 even if Ian Botham did take the proverbial with his Beefy's Own comeback.</p> <p>Happiness may be a cigar called Hamlet, finding a pencil or even a warm gun; it is also the memory of those five days at the Oval in 1991. This was a magical match played in gorgeous sunshine that almost had a fairytale quality. England beat West Indies, still the undisputed world champions, by five wickets to secure an heroic 2-2 series draw. Younger readers may wonder what the fuss is about (a draw against West Indies? <em>Whatever</em>) but a drawn series was as joyously improbable as victory in the 2005 Ashes. England had lost seven series in a row against West Indies, going back to 1974. In this paper, Mike Selvey wrote that \"for England and English cricket \u2026 [the draw] represents quite possibly the most stirring of post-war deeds and arguably the grandest of them all\". Like 2005, the series ended on an unforgettably crazy Monday (we did think about calling it a manic Monday but, y'know). In the Times, Alan Lee said that \"one of the great games in Test cricket history climaxed in a rare and precious sporting day\".</p> <p>For England, a happy ending seemed utterly improbable a week earlier. After starting the series with an immense victory at Headingley, when Graham Gooch made his astonishing 154 not out, they had been slowly brought to heel by West Indies, who won the third and fourth Tests to take a 2-1 lead. Now the Windies were coming to the Oval, their favourite English ground and the one most suited to their phalanx of fast bowlers. The bookies made England 5-1 before the match. OK, there was two 00s missing from Headingley 1981, when England were 500-1, but it was still not exactly a vote of confidence. England went for their 007, the all-action hero Botham, who had once been pitched as the next James Bond. Botham had not played Test cricket for two years but was part of a dramatic reinvention of the team that even the chairman of selectors Ted Dexter said was \"high-risk\".</p> <p>That was a generous description. The selectors basically went rogue, ripping up the existing XI and taking myriad gambles in a bespoke team that never played together before or after. Out went Graeme Hick \u2013 who had been persecuted by Curtly Ambrose \u2013 Allan Lamb, Richard Illingworth, Jack Russell and the injured Derek Pringle. In came Botham, the fit again Robin Smith, Alec Stewart, Phil Tufnell and David 'Syd' Lawrence. Four of the five were significant risks. Even though Botham had panelled 161 against West Indies for Worcestershire earlier in the summer, his Test record against them was poor and nobody knew whether, at 35, he could still cut it at international level. Stewart had not kept wicket in first-class cricket for Surrey all summer. Tufnell had been ostracised after the previous winter's tour of Australia because of his inability to fit in with the new professional ethos of Gooch and Micky Stewart; and Lawrence, though genuinely fast, was inexperienced and erratic. All four would play vital roles in the match.</p> <p>The Stewart selection was particularly controversial. At that stage he was a batsman who kept only in limited-overs cricket, but England wanted five bowlers and that meant a keeper who could bat in the top six. A Guardian leader called it \"crazy\" and said he had \"demonstrated before that he isn't up to the job\". In his Times piece ahead of the squad selection, Lee said \"surely the idea is not even worth discussing\". Even Gooch, whose idea it was, said \"I don't like the principle, and I wouldn't say for a minute it wasn't a gamble.\" Stewart said he was \"very pleased but surprised.\" Russell kept his own counsel. \"The outrage of almost everyone in the game speaks eloquently enough for the wicketkeeper England have discarded on entirely spurious grounds,\" wrote Lee in the Times. He and others were more than happy to praise Stewart after an almost flawless performance. \"The selectors \u2026 are to be congratulated,\" wrote Lee nine days later. \"Stewart did both jobs commendably well.\"</p> <p>Most of the build-up, inevitably, was dominated by another all-rounder, the returning Botham. He celebrated his recall by taking seven for 54 against Warwickshire on the Monday before the game, the best figures of his long County Championship career. \"MR INCREDIBLE\" roared the back page of the Express. It was pitched as Both v Viv, one last time: Botham's comeback and Viv Richards's farewell. With West Indies having no Tests scheduled for the next 15 months (in the end they played the newly reintegrated South Africa in April 1992), it was widely and correctly assumed that this would be the Test match farewell of three West Indian greats: Richards, Malcolm Marshall and Jeffrey Dujon.</p> <p>The cricket-loving philanthropist Patrick Whittingdale arranged a pre-match dinner at which Fleet Street's finest paid tribute to Richards. Perhaps the greatest of them all, John Woodcock, said: \"If I were to choose two players to watch between lunch and tea, of all those I have ever seen, I would want to watch Denis [Compton] and you \u2013 and I hope he would not run you out.\" Viv said he was a \"bit moved\" \u2013 akin to most men admitting they'd gone a big rubbery one \u2013 although he was not in the mood mood to get too sentimental. \"You'd think,\" he said, \"that Viv was dead or something.\" His old mate Beefy was certainly back. With his first ball in the nets he sent Smith's stumps flying. \"If one did not know better,\" wrote Selvey in this paper, \"one would say it was a set-up.\"</p> <p>Botham spent most of the first day struggling with a virus. If his sense of smell was compromised, then the England's batsmen's was more acute than ever. And the only thing they could smell was leather. Presented with the first fast pitch of the summer after a series of slow seamers, the quartet of Ambrose, Marshall, Courtney Walsh and Patrick Patterson enjoyed themselves. There was another reason to pummel the pitch halfway down: it would be the West Indies' last Test before the introduction of a regulation limiting bowlers to one bouncer per over. One last blast of chin music for the road \u2013 and on the road, for the Oval was like a concrete slab.</p> <p>For England to close on 231 for four was an outstanding effort. \"England survived relatively intact against the most torrid three sessions they have experienced since they were steamrollered in Antigua 18 months ago,\" said Selvey in this paper. In the series, their scores had been 198, 252, 354, 300, 211, 188 and 255. They had been taking on the West Indies' pace quartet with just two and a half batsmen. Gooch and Smith were simply magnificent \u2013 \"It would hardly be an exaggeration,\" wrote Scyld Berry in Wisden, \"to say they both batted virtually as well as humanly possible\" \u2013 while the 21-year-old Mark Ramprakash, in his debut series, showed plenty of moxie even if he kept getting stuck in the twenties. But Hick, Lamb and Mike Atherton made 242 runs at 10.52, while Hugh Morris had failed twice on his debut in the previous Test at Edgbaston.</p> <p>When England won the toss and batted, Gooch and particularly Morris were subjected to a brutal working over. They somehow got through to lunch at 82 for none, and were even applauded off by some of the West Indian team for their performance. Morris, only 5ft 8in, showed almighty courage. \"By lunchtime,\" wrote Woodcock in the Times, \"Gooch knew he had found a kindred spirit.\" As they walked off Gooch put a paternal arm round his new opening partner.</p> <p>After lunch, Ambrose moved things up a notch. He smashed Morris on the jaw, breaking his helmet in the process. It was the first of five bouncers in seven balls to Morris, the last of which brought his wicket. Morris's 44, made in 189 minutes, was worth plenty more. It was, said Lee, \"an ordeal he is unlikely ever to forget\". His wicket sparked a collapse of three for eight in 21 balls. Atherton went for a duck, fending a beast from Courtney Walsh to slip. \"It would have ripped out his throat had he not got a glove there first,\" said Selvey. Gooch went to the magnificent Ambrose.</p> <p>In the Times, Lee described that afternoon session as \"two hours of purgatory\", with only 23 overs bowled and barely an idea where the next run was coming from. In the Express, Colin Bateman said \"the batsmen's sole intention was to leave the middle on two feet as opposed to a stretcher\". But Smith, promoted to No4, and Ramprakash, calmly rebuilt the innings. At that stage Smith was one of the world's best \u2013 third in the official rankings behind Gooch and Richie Richardson \u2013 while Ramprakash seemed undeniably to be made of the right stuff. If you had pencilled him in for 5000 Test runs, the only query would have been why you set the bar so low. His temperament and technique under the most extreme pressure were revelatory. He batted over 15 hours in the series, even though he never got beyond 29, and each of his innings lasted at least an hour. His scores in the series were 27, 27, 24, 13, 21, 29, 25, 25 and 19.</p> <p>When he was hit early in his innings, Ramprakash did not rub his body and stared straight back at Ambrose. When a nastier blow on the wrist precipitated treatment, Richie Benaud observed on the BBC that Ramprakash had \"a ton of courage\". He made a calm 25 from 78 balls before, the hard work done, falling tamely to Carl Hooper. It was another immensely promising innings, and Selvey wrote that \"he had established himself as a batsman of undoubted Test-match temperament\". This is the true sadness of Ramprakash's career: many unfulfilled talents look out of place in Test cricket at the start, like Hick, yet he could barely have had a more impressive debut series.</p> <p>Or a more impressive partner in this innings. After a traumatic winter in Australia, Smith was in the form of his life. He resumed on 54 for the second day, and went on to make his second century of the series; his 109 was an innings of monumental mental strength and physical bravery. He had a badly injured finger on the right hand and was also suffering with a virus, yet nothing was going to curb his almost masochistic enthusiasm for facing the West Indian quicks. He took his blows, one on the glove and two in the stomach, and landed them too. The speed-of-light square cut was in full evidence, with two in two balls off Ambrose, and he also drove handsomely on the rare occasions the opportunity presented itself.</p> <p>Smith reached 2,000 Test runs in what was only his 27th Test, and his performance in this match took his average to 52.58 \u2013 outrageous for that era (Andrew Jones, Javed Miandad and Mark Taylor were the only contemporary players with a higher average), especially because 20 of his 27 Tests had been against the world's best, West Indies and Australia. It's often said that South African-born batsmen have to work 10 times as hard to win affection in England, yet Smith would walk into an XI of England's most-loved cricketers. His magnificent performances against West Indies are one of the main reasons for that. \"If a Test of a batsman's rating is reckoned to be how he fares against a latter-day West Indian attack, Robin Smith is just about at the top of the tree,\" wrote Woodcock in the Times. \"No one counter-punches against them with the same resilience and aggressiveness.\"</p> <p>Smith's hundred helped England to the holy grail of 400 \u2013 a total they had not reached in an amazing 66 innings against the West Indies. They had to beg, steal and borrow every run. There were 54 in extras, 39 of them no-balls, and their 419 took more than 150 overs. Stewart and Botham each made 31 \u2013 Botham's was a responsible effort that took over two hours \u2013 and Chris Lewis punched a superb 47 not out from No8.</p> <p>At that stage Lewis seemed to be maturing beautifully \u2013 on the fourth day of the match he would bowl an outstanding spell of 15 overs for 16 either side of lunch, including seven overs for one run at one stage \u2013 and was a potential successor to Botham. Not that anyone could deny Botham the spotlight. The end to his innings, when he tried to hook Ambrose and staggered towards his own wicket, dislodging the bails as he unsuccessfully tried to hurdle the stumps, was the moment of the day. Not least because of the impact it had on Test Match Special, where it prompted the legendary <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k0qZDdfvZk\" title=\"\">'leg over' commentary from Brian Johnston and Jonathan Agnew</a>. It's an appropriately abiding memory of such a feelgood match. Twenty one years on, it remains instant serotonin.</p> <p>After reaching 419, England began their search for 20 wickets with almost manic desperation. At slip, Botham became the first Englishman to wear sunglasses in a Test (a big deal at the time, believe it or not). Phil Simmons went early, but West Indies ended the second day on 90 for one after England put down both Desmond Haynes (off Botham's fourth ball; so nearly another who-writes-your-scripts moment) and Richardson with the score on 85. An eventful day also included a 10-minute delay while he groundstaff cleared paper from around the ground, which had been thrown like ticker tape during a Mexican wave. \"One of the more brainless things you could ever see at a cricket match,\" said Benaud on the BBC.</p> <p>It was nowhere near as brainless as what we saw the following day, when West Indies ushered themselves towards defeat with an absurd display against Phil Tufnell. \"Somewhere in the history of Test cricket,\" wrote the BBC commentator Jack Bannister, \"a team may have tossed away a near-unassailable position in a five-match series with as abject a batting display \u2026 but I doubt it.\" They were 158 for three when Tufnell came on for his first bowl of the day; in the next 63 balls they lost seven for 18, most to ridiculous slogs. Tufnell finished with figures of 14.3-3-25-6. His figures for the day were 5.3-2-4-6. The last six batsmen scored four between them.</p> <p>Tufnell was a genuine matchwinner around that time, a Cockney with craft who flighted the ball and outwitted good batsmen. He took five-fors in his next two Tests as well. He bowled impressively here, too, but the West Indian batting was at best lamentable, at worst disgraceful. It started when the debutant Clayton Lambert (covering for the injured Gus Logie, only because a young Brian Lara was injured) slogged his first ball miles in the air. Richards, down the order because of a migraine, sliced a wild on-the-run drive and was beautifully caught by Stewart, and the tail continued to die by the long handle. Haynes was alone as the others jumped off a deck that wasn't even burning. He carried his bat for 75 not out, an innings of serene authority that put the pitch in the context.</p> <p>The upshot of all these upward shots was that West Indies followed on against England for the first time in 22 years. This time they batted properly, downgrading their approach against Tufnell from demented swishing to calculated aggression. (Having taken six for 25 in the first innings, Tufnell ended up a sixth of the wickets for six times as many runs: one for 150, even though he actually bowled pretty well.) Botham picked up a couple of important wickets, and then Lawrence dismissed Haynes, who left the field for the first time in the match. West Indies closed day three on 152 for three, a deficit of 91.</p> <p>At that stage, Test cricket on a Sunday was still an unusual occurrence. We might have expected a quiet, respectful start. Some chance. Hooper, his genius in full flow, hit three sixes in the first six overs of the day, two of them off Tufnell. But Tufnell kept his nerve, kept flighting the ball, and had Hooper caught on the drive at short extra cover for a lustrous 54. It was one of only three wickets England took all day; any tentative hope that victory might come easily soon disappeared. Richardson \u2013 who before the series was disparaged as somebody who could not bat in English conditions \u2013 made his second century in a row, a high-class 121 from 312 balls. It was a masterful display of how to judge and sometimes dictate the mood of a tense day's play. At times he was becalmed, especially in excellent duels with Lewis and Tufnell in the afternoon session, at others freewheeling. He raced from 85 to 99 in four deliveries from Lawrence.</p> <p>And then there was Viv. He walked to the crease for his final Test innings needing 20 for a career average of 50. The parallels with Don Bradman 43 years earlier were obvious; in this paper, Selvey joked that he might be bowled for nought by an Atherton googly. Richards reached 20 with one of the few all-run fours of his career and played with furious determination. \"He played the innings of a batsman pouring every last drop of experience, technique and willpower into a final effort, taking no risks, playing exclusively on merit and punching boundaries only when presented with an unequivocal case for dispatching the ball,\" wrote Selvey. \"It was classical batting against fine bowling.\"</p> <p>Having reached 50, Viv's temperature was rasied by the hustle and bristle of Lawrence. He was, as Frank Keating put it, \"beginning to get on the great man's wick\". Two disdainful boundaries were followed with a drag to Morris at mid-on. One of the greatest batting careers was over. Richards walked off to a standing ovation, cap pulled down over his eyes, the window to his soul kept shut. We will never know if there were tears at that moment, and it is right that it should be that way. There were certainly tears around the ground. \"Cricket provides its moving moments,\" wrote Selve, \"and this stung the eyes more than most.\" A banner on the Harleyford Road flats said simply: 'Thanks Viv, we'll miss you'.</p> <p>We would miss the brilliant Dujon too, even if by now he was a fading force. Two years before the debut of Glenn McGrath, he became the first Test batsman to lose his Test wicket to a pigeon. He was unsettled by its seed-gathering presence at silly point, and stopped play to shoo it away. After a delay of 93 seconds, Dujon wafted absent-mindedly at the next ball and was caught behind. That was 311 for six, but when the players came off at 4.55pm West Indies had moved on to 356 for six, a lead of 113, For England fans, The Fear was making its presence known, even if excitement remained the principal emotion. In the Express on Monday morning, the first line of Bateman's report captured the mood. \"Take a day's holiday, get a sick note, fake amnesia \u2013 whatever it takes, forget work and don't miss the cricket in SE11 today.\" By lunchtime the ground was full, with shiny happy people basking in a rare sporting occasion.</p> <p>Phil DeFreitas completed a wonderful series (22 wickets at 20.77) by dismissing Marshall and Ambrose in the first over, and then Lawrence completed his first five-for for England with the wickets of Walsh and Richardson. England's target was 143. Any suggestion it might be easy was dispelled when Patterson gave Morris the definitive snorter. Three for one. Wickets fell with troubling regularity, but England \u2013 running with the mood of the day \u2013 rattled along at a crazy run rate. Ambrose and Patterson ended with one-day figures of 8-0-48-0 and 9-0-63-2. At 80 for four, with Gooch and Smith gone, England were in a bit of trouble. But Ramprakash, indecently calm again, took 27 minutes to get off the mark while Stewart counter-punched at the other end to make a rapid 38 not out.</p> <p>They took England to within one run of victory when Richards threw the ball to the part-timer Lambert to finish the game. Absurdly he dismissed Ramprakash, but that allowed the dream ending. Botham strode to the wicket and pulled his first ball for four to Compton's Corner. \"Compton's famous sweep for the Ashes triumph of 1953 had finished in the same spot,\" said Wisden, \"and in many ways this match was just as memorable in Oval Test history.\" Botham may not have got his leg over but he had got England's leg over the line: it was his first ever Test win in 20 attempts against West Indies, and he had hit the winning runs in his first Test for two years. Who wrote his scripts? He did, of course.</p> <p>If Botham had inevitably stolen the show, nobody doubted that the biggest hero was the captain. \"GOOCHIE'S FINEST HOUR!\" was the Daily Mirror headline the next day. His unimaginable excellence had driven England to such rare heights. A couple of years earlier, the chairman of selectors Dexter said Gooch had \"the charisma of a wet fish\". Now he called him \"a very special guy\". Gooch looked shattered, having given his soul and body all summer. As champagne was sprayed all around him, he sat nursing a cup of tea. Forget the run orgy of 1990; this was Gooch's summer.</p> <p>West Indies were not too sad, despite their defeat. They retained the Wisden Trophy and remained unbeaten in a series since 1979-80. A match and series full of decency of dignity left little scope for regrets. Two decades on, the memories have added poignancy because of the fate of some of the players. Marshall, the greatest of all fast bowlers, would die aged 41 in 1999; Lawrence's career would effectively be ended by an horrific knee injury during the tour of New Zealand that winter. (If you want to see, or rather hear, the injury \u2013 although it is truly horrible and we don't recommend it \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSumYe7UPPM\" title=\"\">you can click here</a>) Lawrence was one of a number of the England team who did not or were not allowed to fulfil the considerable promise they showed in the match or the series: Ramprakash, Morris, Lewis, Tufnell, DeFreitas, maybe even Smith.</p> <p>At the time the future was not ours to see, and there was only a warm, fuzzy feeling. \"It has been a wonderful summer,\" said Richards. \"We go back with our heads held high. The series was played in a wonderful spirit of keenness and generosity, and as it's level, the only outright winner is this wonderful game, which we all love dearly.\" The tour manager Lance Gibbs said it was \"the happiest and most sporting of tours I can remember\", a status that was even more striking because it followed a nasty series between West Indies and Australia earlier that year.</p> <p>Wisden concurred that the series was \"staged in the best of spirit\", as did the Guardian. \"Of all the good things to come out of this series,\" wrote Selvey, \"perhaps the most significant was the manner in which the contests were conducted, proving conclusively that to compete fiercely \u2013 and there is no more ferocious contest than that between batsman and mega-fast bowlers on a surge \u2013 it is not necessary to drag the game into the gutter.\" Instead, for five days in August 1991, it was elevated to the stars.</p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/signup/2010/mar/30/1\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Spin, the Guardian's free weekly cricket email.

  "<p>Of all the expert advice that could have come out of the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghfringesurvivalguide.com\" title=\"\">Edinburgh Fringe Survival Guide: Live!</a> event I organised last Thursday, the lesson I least expected to hear was the value of sobriety. It often seems the Edinburgh festivals are powered by an unholy cocktail of creativity, blind hope and beer. And mainly beer. If only financially, it's hard to see how any of it would happen without the sale of large quantities of alcohol. And, after all, what would a festival be without a dash of hedonistic excess?</p> <p>Yet, as my guests and I took to the stage, there was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/09/orla-o-loughlin-edinburgh-festival\" title=\"\">Orla O'Loughlin</a>, artistic director of the Traverse, and Kath Mainland, <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/edinburgh-festivals/all-articles/fringe-chief-says-the-price-of-fame-is-well-worth-paying-for-1-2460385\" title=\"\">chief executive of the Fringe Society</a>, trying to trump each other with the number of hours' sleep they'd had on Wednesday night. \"If your definition of success is getting drunk every night, I'm not having a very good fringe,\" said Mainland.</p> <p>O'Loughlin, too, had been keeping the booze in check, even though the Traverse bar is a networking nerve-centre. \"We sell a lot of beer, especially now we've got our own Trav Ale, but no, I'm not getting drunk every night. It means I can't do my job very well the next morning,\" she said.</p> <p>By comparison Aneke McCulloch, producer with Australia's <a href=\"http://seesault.com/current-projects/\" title=\"\">Seesault</a>, sounded less abstemious, but even she has an eminently sensible strategy. \"I've been compromising a little bit,\" she said. \"I've come up with the rule to stop drinking eight hours before I have to be up, so if I don't get a full night's sleep, at least I'm not hungover. You have to be prepared that it's hard work 20 hours a day, and if you can't do that, then it's not the place to be \u2013 and if you can, then it's really rewarding.\"</p> <p>My fourth guest in the Pleasance Cabaret Bar in this series of six shows about the secrets of fringe success was Tess Waters, performer in the raucous <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/comedy/sexytime\" title=\"\">Sexytime!</a>, and even as an Edinburgh newcomer she was working just as hard as she was playing. \"You should be motivated by the process, the experience and your craft,\" she said, estimating her company's outlay at AUS$22,000.</p> <p>We spent some time trying to define what success meant \u2013 if not a month of drunkenness or an immediate financial payback, then maybe a sense of artistic fulfilment or a wedge of extra names in your contacts book. For O'Loughlin, one of the indicators of success for her inaugural season was its ability to stir up debate. At the end of one recent performance, she said, an audience member stood up and shouted \"Rubbish!\" prompting another audience member to counter with \"You're rubbish!\". \"That's part of the thing that we want to cling onto,\" she said.</p> <p>Indeed, despite their abstinence, this panel could not be mistaken for a temperance society. Success for O'Loughlin was \"something about risk and buzz and energy and that thing that's of the moment that you can't ever plan for\" and Mainland agreed: \"There's something really compelling about it \u2026 the thing that makes it not just successful but exciting. That is a huge part of its appeal.\"</p> <p>Behind all the hard work and fun, suggested Waters, the secret of fringe success is a passion for what you're doing. \"We step on stage and we just love our work and we want to share that with people,\" she said. \"If you don't love it, no one else is going to.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Theatre critic Mark Fisher is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/stage/9781408132524/the-edinburgh-fringe-survival-guide-how-to-make-your-show-a-success\" title=\"\">The Edinburgh Fringe Survival Guide</a></p>",
  "<p>The Olympic legacy has promised to create a \"healthier, happier, more active nation\", so it's ironic that I spent more time in the last fortnight sitting on my bum glued to the TV than ever before. But not, perhaps, as ironic as the government's failure thus far to capitalise on the current wave of enthusiasm for sport with a cohesive strategy for promoting physical activity.</p> <p>A report just published by the House of Lords <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/hlscience/\" title=\"\">Science and Technology Committee</a> entitled <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldselect/ldsctech/33/33.pdf\" title=\"\">\"Sport and exercise science and medicine: building on the Olympic legacy to improve the nation's health\"</a> expresses surprise and disappointment in \"the apparent lack of joined-up thinking in government about the Olympic health legacy\".</p> <p>\"While 'sport' belongs to the Department of Culture Media and Sport, 'exercise or physical activity' is seen as being within the remit of the Department of Health,' says David Stalker, CEO of the <a href=\"http://www.fia.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fitness Industry Association</a> (FIA). Hugh Robertson, the minister for sport, openly declared that his interest was in increasing participation rather than improving the nation's health, leading Lord Krebs, the chairman of the committee, to state: \"Government is failing to act in a consistent way to ensure that the Olympics help us tackle one of our greatest health threats \u2013 sedentary lifestyles.\"</p> <p>If you are in any doubt about the magnitude of the problem, consider the findings of a <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61031-9/abstract\" title=\"\">study published last month in the Lancet</a> that concluded physical inactivity was responsible for 6-10% of cases of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancer globally \u2013 and 9% of premature deaths. This, the authors suggest, makes a sedentary lifestyle as serious a threat to health and longevity as smoking. The Lancet also revealed that we in Britain are among the most slothful nations in the developed world, with 63.3% of us failing to meet the recommended physical activity guidelines.</p> <p>So why, given the compelling evidence of a clear dose-response relationship between physical activity and disease, have we failed to recognise and promote the role of physical activity both in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease?</p> <p>One possible reason, believes sports and exercise medicine consultant Dr Richard Weiler, is the lack of emphasis on physical activity and its benefits in British medical schools. Weiler's research, <a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2012/07/20/bjsports-2012-091380.abstract\" title=\"\">published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine this month</a>, found that 44% of medical schools did not teach trainee doctors the national exercise guidelines, and that on average a paltry 4.2 hours was devoted to education on physical activity. In separate research, a survey of 48 London GP practices revealed that none knew the latest physical activity guidelines.</p> <p>\"There is an urgent need for physical activity teaching to have dedicated time at medical schools, to equip tomorrow's doctors with the basic knowledge, confidence and skills to promote physical activity,\" says Weiler.</p> <p>Stalker agrees. \"Two-thirds of the population isn't doing enough exercise and 83% of the population goes to their GP every year,\" he says. \"So it is a case of GPs understanding that although not all of this 83% have a chronic condition, physical inactivity is a major risk factor for disease and they need to have the confidence to make recommendations and referrals to exercise.\"</p> <p>The Lords committee identified lack of awareness and inadequate training among health professionals as a key barrier preventing the treatment of ill health by exercise, as well as a lack of confidence in exercise referral schemes.</p> <p>But Stalker says change is afoot. \"The <a href=\"http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal College of Physicians</a> called for the development of clear standards outlining the process by which a doctor can refer a patient to an exercise programme,\" he explains. \"This work is underway, led by a joint consultative forum between the medical profession and exercise sector and represents the first time these sectors have worked together.\"</p> <p>Dr Andrew Murray, the recently appointed \"physical activity champion\" for the Scottish government, says steps are already being taken in Scotland. \"They've really grasped the importance of this issue up here,\" he says. Murray is working closely with Scotland's chief medical officer to promote physical activity with the aims of increasing life expectancy and decreasing the incidence of chronic disease. The more immediate goal is to increase the percentage of Scots meeting the guidelines from 39% currently to 50% by 2022.</p> <p>How? A <a href=\"http://www.salsc.org.uk/htdocs/list/MinisterialDebate17052012.php\" title=\"\">ministerial debate on obesity and physical activity</a> held in the Scottish parliament in May led to pledges from Shona Robison, minister for Commonwealth Games and sport, to maintain the physical activity budget of \u00a33.3m for the next three years, to make \u00a36m available to local authorities to help them achieve the \"two hours of PE per week\" target, and to increase funding for sustainable transport initiatives including walking and cycling. Meanwhile, NHS Scotland has just released a series of free online educational tools for its staff to learn how best to broach the subject of physical activity and motivate and support people to get active. \"We need to get the message across that physical activity is not only important by itself, it can also offset the symptoms of many obesity-related conditions, such as diabetes and osteoarthritis,\" says Murray.</p> <p>While Stalker believes that educating healthcare professionals will make a difference, he is keen to see other action. \"There is an argument for placing an exercise professional or someone qualified to delivery physical activity counselling within GP surgeries to offer support in identifying patient pathways for exercise,\" he says. \"Equally important is ensuring that physical activity is represented within the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF), which is the system incentivising GPs to prescribe certain treatments.\"</p> <p>This was one of the recommendations made the by Lords report, along with support for appropriate training both at undergraduate level and in continuing professional development of health professionals, in prescribing exercise as a preventative measure and treatment for chronic diseases.</p> <p>The committee also recommended that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) assesses the research on the use of exercise in the management of chronic diseases and, where the evidence supports it, update their guidelines to reflect these findings. This could lead to a scenario where a GP assesses a patient and decides the most appropriate treatment for their high blood pressure is physical activity rather than drugs.</p> <p>While it is encouraging to see a more committed attitude to physical activity from the government, Dr Weiler stresses the importance of a coordinated approach. \"We need the same type of strategy that was used for smoking cessation,\" he says. That campaign went far beyond telling people smoking was bad for them: it also entailed supporting their efforts to stop on a practical level and using legislation to make not smoking easier than smoking.</p> <p>\"One of the problems is that our environment is not designed to encourage physical activity,\" says Weiler. In offices, shopping centres and other public buildings, lifts and escalators take centre stage, with dingy staircases round the back \u2013 out of sight and out of mind. Yet the Lancet study found that campaigns using motivational signs, such as those directing people to stairs instead of lifts, were among the most successful. Exactly this type of signage has been used in London throughout the Olympics \u2013 presumably as much to ease the strain on the city's public transport system as to boost the nation's health \u2013 but all the same, I'd like to see it remain.</p> <p>Dr Murray agrees. \"It's not just about the NHS. It's about doing things systematically \u2013 looking at transport, urban design, employer responsibility \u2013 and delivering a clear, consistent message,\" he says.</p> <p>Fred Turok, the FIA's chairman, chairs the government's <a href=\"http://responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Responsibility Deal</a> physical activity network, which works to encourage businesses to promote physical activity among employees \u2013 emphasising the knock-on effect that a healthier workforce has on productivity and profitability. \"It's not just about gyms at the office,\" he says. \"It's about enabling employees to be more active: providing showers, prioritising stairs over lifts or promoting active commuting \u2013 walking, running or cycling to work.\"&#xa0;That's all for the good, as long as employees embracing the \"move more, more often\" message don't get made to feel like slackers when they spend their allotted lunch hour taking a walk or hitting the gym.</p> <p>Even though the government is finally acknowledging what the fitness industry has been saying for decades \u2013 that physical activity matters \u2013 it's not yet clear whether the sofa-bound British public will buy into it this time around. Stalker is optimistic. \"I think the reaction we have seen to this summer's Olympic Games, coupled with a backdrop of rising levels of obesity and a health service at breaking point, have driven people towards the realisation that they cannot put off getting active any longer,\" he says.</p> <p>Weiler agrees. \"We can't carry on doing nothing about it. The cost of doing so will far outweigh the investment required to increase physical activity levels and prevent this public health crisis.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of Ireland's most influential journalists, Vincent Browne, argues that Denis O'Brien is not a fit person to control Independent News &amp; Media (INM).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0815/1224322198397.html\">In an Irish Times article today</a>, he accuses O'Brien - the largest shareholder in INM - of interfering in editorial affairs. </p> <p>He also cites the findings of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriarty_Tribunal\">the Moriarty tribunal</a>, which concluded that a consortium formed by O'Brien to secure a mobile phone licence in the 1990s had succeeded because of payments made by O'Brien to the then communications minister in \"clandestine circumstances.\" O'Brien has strenuously denied this finding. </p> <p>Browne also takes a sideswipe at the former INM controller, Tony O'Reilly, by accusing him also of interfering with editorial policy, notably at the group's Sunday Independent title.</p> <p>But O'Brien is his main target.

  "<p>She is \"<a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/06/angela-merkels-mania-austerity-destroying-europe\" title=\"\">Europe's most dangerous leader</a>\", the \"<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-iron-frau-angela-merkel-1941814.html\" title=\"\">Iron Frau</a>\" who is \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2060751/Angela-Merkels-refusal-loosen-purse-strings-makes-hero-Germany.html\" title=\"\">dragging us towards the abyss</a>\". Angela Merkel's handling of the euro crisis, it is safe to say, has not been met with approval on the world stage. Even at home, the German chancellor recently had to dodge <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/euro-crisis-exposing-fault-lines-in-merkel-government-a-842739.html\" title=\"\">criticism by a group of prominent economists</a>; one of her own party members has gone public to complain about her authoritarian style of running the Christian Democrats. Such is the international anger about her apparent failure to save the euro that the Economist, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21560269\" title=\"\">in its current issue</a>, asked for some sympathy for \"Germany's long-suffering chancellor\" \u2013 while still criticising Merkel for her indecisiveness.</p> <p>And yet, in spite of the financial crisis going from bad to worse, the German people are still firmly behind her. According to a recent opinion poll by public broadcaster ARD, <a href=\"http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend1560.html\" title=\"\">70% of all Germans feel Merkel is the best person to save the euro</a>. A similar survey by news magazine Stern confirmed her popularity; if they could vote for their head of government directly, 49% of all Germans would choose Merkel.</p> <p>The fact that the German economy has until now fared rather well through the global downturn alone does not fully explain her widespread popularity. Her own Christian Democratic party, for example, has not benefitted from the country's economic stability in the same way. According to the ARD survey, only 36% of Germans would give Merkel's party their vote if they could go to the polls now. In contrast, Merkel is perceived almost as a non-partisan head of state rather than a career politician. To put this into perspective, imagine Margaret Thatcher, the \"Iron Lady\" Merkel is often compared to, enjoying the Queen's levels of popularity.</p> <p>This enthusiasm, to put it mildly, is puzzling. Even Merkel's most ardent supporters would find it hard to argue that she is a very inspirational or charismatic leader. How can such a reserved, rational and uninspiring politician arouse such widespread approval?</p> <p>It's not just national stereotypes that tell us that Germans have an aversion to flashy leaders. Since they followed Kaiser Wilhelm II and Hitler into two disastrous world wars, Germans have developed a tendency to vote for more tempered and earnest leaders. In 1957, the Christian Democrats headed their election campaign with the fabulously uninspiring slogan \"No Experiments!\" \u2013 and won over 50% of the vote, still the highest result in German postwar history.</p> <p>Helmut Kohl, the first chancellor of a unified Germany, was the embodiment of dependability and stability, and Merkel, the country's first east German leader, fits this mould perfectly. To be sure, Germany also had its share of showy politicians, like the cigar-chomping Gerhard Schr\u00f6der or the Green party's patriarch, Joschka Fischer. But both toned down their personal style once they were in government, Schr\u00f6der losing his Cohibas and Fischer changing his eco-activist get-up for dapper suits. Only last year, defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, whose louche looks and brash rhetorical style had thrown Merkel's rather distant cautiousness into sharp relief, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12608083\" title=\"\">had to step down</a> after he was convicted of plagiarism and lost his PhD title.</p> <p>Such flamboyance is still unthinkable with the current chancellor. There is nothing remotely eccentric or extravagant about Merkel; her biggest personal scandal of the last few months was the fact that she wore <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/9427863/Double-take-Angela-Merkel-steps-out-in-same-dress-she-wore-to-same-event-four-years-ago.html\" title=\"\">the same dress</a> to the opening of this year's Bayreuth festival she had worn a few years before.</p> <p>This down-to-earth approach is also reflected in Merkel's cautious political style, which has often led the international press to accuse her of lacking a clear vision for Europe's future. However, this aversion to big ideas is a long-standing part of German postwar political culture. Helmut Schmidt, Kohl's Social Democratic predecessor, once famously quipped that people with visions should go and see a doctor. In a country that has experienced the two major political ideologies of the 20th century \u2013 fascism and communism \u2013 not just in theory but in its most harsh and real form, lofty idealism in politics is often viewed with suspicion.</p> <p>The most important reason for Merkel's popularity at home, however, is neither the euro crisis nor German history, but herself. Somehow, this female, middle-aged, childless physicist from a Protestant background has convinced conservative fathers from Catholic Bavaria, working-class women from west Germany's old industrial areas and Berlin's intellectual bohemians alike that she is the best representative of their interests. Merkel has managed to remain an enigma to most Germans, a blank sheet on to which they can project their personal idea of their leader. Only last week she gave a <a href=\"http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/liste/h/201232\" title=\"\">rare personal interview</a> to the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung's weekend supplement: readers learnt that the biggest folly of the chancellor's youth was ruining a brand-new tracksuit by \"crawling into a resinous tree cave\" and that her dream dinner guest is Spain's national coach Vincente del Bosque. But her sparse, dispassionate answers still gave nothing away about her inner workings and the paper concluded that \"nobody really knows Angela Merkel\".</p> <p>As her approval rating shows, this taciturnity is working in her favour. In our media-centred political culture, full of spin doctors, photo ops and publicity stunts, the most effective public relations strategy seems to be to keep things private.</p>",
  "<p>It's nearly a year since Bernard Hogan-Howe took over as Metropolitan Police commissioner to the swooning approval of law-and-order politicians and press. Crime stats in Liverpool, where he'd been top cop before, looked tremendous and his talk of \"total policing\" excited visions of a \"zero tolerance\" approach to make \"Dirty\" Harry Callaghan look like a quivering equivocator. Here was the back-to-basics, \"no nonsense\" enforcer London needed after the riots. And so on.</p> <p>Inevitably, the real Hogan-Howe quickly proved to be more nuanced than the imagined one. A <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/hogans-a-hero-new-met-chief-chases-and-nabs-bicycle-thieves-6442857.html\">report</a> that he had chased and \"nabbed\" two bicycle thieves outside City Hall appears to have exemplified the initial triumph of news fantasy over fact, with Hogan-Howe reportedly \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8761064/New-Met-chief-Bernard-Hogan-Howe-is-embarrassed-by-Tories-hero-claims.html\">embarrassed and bemused</a>\" by the claim. One of his first public remarks was that stop-and-search, greatly increased since spring 2008 in line with the wishes of Boris Johnson, should be targeted more effectively. \"Total policing,\" it <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/about/hogan_howe.html\">emerged</a>, was more about improving professionalism than imitating comic book action heroism.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe has made an effort to meet Londoners since landing his job, addressing a series of public meetings across the capital. On Tuesday evening he went to Newham where he set out his objectives for the Met to an audience of around 150 at Stratford's Picturehouse cinema and took part in a question-and-answer session, which I chaired. </p> <p>In his speech the commissioner outlined his \"total policing\" idea as a combination of focussed action against crime, care for victims and a high-quality culture at all levels of the organisation, guided by a solid team ethic. He anticipated completing a \"strategic plan\" for putting his vision into effect by the end of 2012, a task that will have to accommodate making savings of \u00a3500m over three years out of annual \u00a33b budget - savings that were bound to mean the Met employing fewer people.</p> <p>Even so, he intends to \"improve, not reduce the neighbourhood policing model,\" finding \"maybe\" 2,000 officers for such duties. \"We'll know by Christmas,\" he said. The Met's budget is set by the new Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, headed by serial \"waste\"-slasher and beat officer fan Deputy Greenhalgh. I picture the Sheffield-born cop with the law degree from Oxford and the \"impatient visionary\" of small state Conservatism crunching numbers together, and wonder what each makes of the other. (Any information from public-spirited citizens leading to a deeper knowledge of their relationship's chemistry would be treated in the strictest confidence.) </p> <p>Three out of the twelve audience questions concerned stop-and-search, and a fourth made allegations of widespread abuse of power in Newham during the Olympics period. I expected a high proportion of challenges of this kind, though I'm told that at some such meetings it is higher. </p> <p>A woman complained that her husband had been stopped \"every damn day\" by \"the same officer\" on his way home from work. A man said that he'd been pressured to provide his name and address following a search, and had difficulty persuading the officer concerned that he was not obliged to do so. A woman from the <a href=\"http://www.nmp.org.uk/p/about-nmp.html\">Newham Monitoring Project</a> (NMP) claimed that \"hundreds of people\" had reported \"young men being illegally strip-searched in the back of vans,\" and wanted to know what the commissioner was going to do about it.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe told NMP woman that if she gave him dates, names and places, \"We'll do something about it.\" He confirmed that the man stopped and searched had been quite right about the law, and said in response to the woman who'd spoken about her husband that the category of people frequently stopped and searched despite never being found to have done anything wrong were his largest concern. </p> <p>He also acknowledged that the recent history of largely random stop and searches, notably those conducted under anti-terrorism powers, had \"left a legacy that we're all now having to work through,\" and that those conducted under <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/stopandsearch/what_is.htm#stopsearch\">section 60</a> of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act (1994) \"were at a level I couldn't quite understand. I think it had become an automatic response to a stabbing or something else.\" That level has been reduced slightly, he said, and better targeting has produced better results: \"Instead of a return of about 9 percent we've now got it up to 17 percent.\"</p> <p>In a short interview after the meeting I asked him why he didn't drop the tactic altogether. After all, its effectiveness is hard to measure and any gains have to be weighed against the counter-productive resentment it creates, especially among black and Asian youths. \"I've been open minded about that,' Hogan-Howe replied. \"I've considered it. But I think at the moment I wouldn't. I think we should first try and improve it.\" </p> <p>He hopes to greatly upgrade officer training in this area. In the next few months, he said, the Met will announce a new anti-knife crime initiative: a dedicated phone number and response officers, accompanied by a public information campaign. \"My theory is that people know who carries knives, in the same way as they know who the burglars are and where stolen property goes, and sometimes they tell us.\" </p> <p>I asked Hogan-Howe if the Met had learned any lessons from policing the Olympics. \"I think it reminded all police officers to be on the front foot,\" he said. \"To be friendly, to be approachable, to talk to children on so on. It's been an easier thing to do with the sorts of the crowds we've been dealing with - you know, football crowds are slightly different. But I think that professionalism and that spirit is something we need to take forward with confidence in the future.\" </p> <p>I also invited him to define \"frontline policing,\" a term deployed by politicians as if its meaning were self-evident, but used by police officers far more warily. He at first jokingly declined, saying the task was impossible but then said it should include all officers who both deal with the public and face an element of personal risk, while a wider definition could include others, such as those who handle phone calls. He seemed to take my point about politicians over-estimating their understanding of the term. \"When you talk to them, they don't,\" he smiled.</p> <p>It was the first time I'd met the commissioner.

But at a time when the criminal bar is struggling to attract the best talent, it is probably the best recruiting tool the profession has. Few other series have portrayed so faithfully how sets operate and their members hustle for work. <em>RT</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp4MEQYEXrc&amp;feature=player_embedded\">North Square</a></h2> <p>A decade before Peter Moffat struck gold with Silk for the BBC, he wrote North Square for Channel 4. Set in Leeds, it stars some of the same cast (notably a younger Rupert Penry-Jones) and acquired something of a cult following among lawyers. Unfortunately, lawyers alone can't sustain a programme, and North Square was axed after one series. But you can still watch every episode online. <em>RT</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=c4_9Z4I81xs\">Kavanagh QC</a></h2> <p>Surely the long-haired Cambridge student played by a brooding young Ewan McGregor can't be a serial rapist - or can he? ITV's Kavanagh QC was first broadcast in 1995 and starred John Thaw in the title role and Anna Chancellor as a barrister. The courtroom exchanges sound heavy-handed now but back then a successful drama series could pull in 13m viewers. Thaw reportedly hated wearing a wig. <em>RT</em></p> <h2>Will Gardner in The Good Wife</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YpXAoTFUkgY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YpXAoTFUkgY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>The Good Wife has been hailed by many critics as a post-feminist legal drama, and it many ways it is: lawyer-turned-stay-at-home-mother Alicia Florrick is wronged by her powerful state's attorney husband, who is caught red-handed in a sexual scandal and sent to jail (parallels with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dominique-strauss-kahn\">DSK</a> are so obvious that viewers may wonder which came first: reality or fiction). Left with two teenagers to provide for, 40-something Florrick has to climb back onto the legal bus to learn from scratch the ropes of the profession she left 15 years ago \u2013 not an easy feat in the world of Chicago law. The show's female characters are fantastic: nuanced, complex, with a dark side seldom shown in action-focused legal dramas. Florrick's internal struggle \u2013 to be a virtuous woman who is very much in public view, or to give in to her true desires \u2013 is a joy to follow. </p> <p>But it is the character of Will Gardner, prodigy-lawyer and partner of the show's legal firm, which really does it for me. Gardner (Josh Charles) is a young and viciously ambitious man who, has shown in the video above, has had to kill a part of himself to be at the top of his game. He can win a case with a nonchalant shrug, a thin smile and a killer line. He has no pity whatsoever for any of his adversaries, but falls for the woman he never forgot: Florrick, whom he dated at university. Gardner is the archetype of the \"ruthless lawyer\" common in too many TV series, but with a twist: his love for her is all-encompassing, and will cost him dearly. I'm a sucker for strong macho types who show signs of weaknesses after wrestling with their emotions, before finally surrendering to them. Clich\u00e9, but what can I say \u2013 it works. <em>JR</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcasb9nAf-g&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Rumpole of the Bailey</a></h2> <p>A certain type of barrister will always model himself on the tenant of 3 Equity Court, who refused to prosecute as a matter of principle. John Mortimer wrote the TV scripts before setting off to the Old Bailey. The Penge Bungalow murders are probably his best-known case. <em>RT</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=uiLXCCMHjfE\">Perry Mason</a></h2> <p>The final episode was broadcast in 1966, but Perry Mason continues to inspire a certain kind of American courtroom drama in which the gifted attorney dramatically demonstrates the defendant's innocence - often in front of a preliminary hearing, apparently because hiring extras to play the jury was expensive. <em>RT</em></p> <h2>Ally McBeal</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_gY4z72Wpds?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_gY4z72Wpds\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Ally McBeal always makes an appearance in top lists of legal dramas, but in fact the law only served as a backdrop to the surreal personal lives of the characters. A sample exchange between John Cage, partner at Ally's firm Cage &amp; Fish, sums it up: \"Because what you do want isn't out there. Secretly I think you know that. That's why you have developed this ability to look at a judge and see Al Green, to look at a cloud and see cotton candy.\" One of the most bizarre TV shows of the 1990s, Ally Mcbeal inspired a generation to think that being a lawyer was all about flirting in <a href=\"http://youtu.be/AYUavFaQwEw\">unisex toilets</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHSuyTrKwdg&amp;feature=fvwrel\">dancing babies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vga4UZs6tpQ\">Barry White cameos</a>. <em>MWR</em></p> <h2>Oliver Babish in The West Wing</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wf8Vl0ORBaE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wf8Vl0ORBaE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The ultimate in-house lawyer, played by Oliver Platt, delivers the ultimate quickfire performance in two minutes of brilliant scripting and pacing. <em>RT</em></p> <h2>Alan Shore in Boston Legal</h2> <p>Alan Shore (James Spader) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=4la8Izrwea8\">delivers a moving courtroom speech</a> on behalf of his client's right to give her sick father a fatal dose of morphine.

  "<p>Social work managers from a black minority ethnic (BME) background who aspire to become heads of service have until 29 August to apply to join a programme designed to help them reach the top. For the second year the Virtual Staff College (VSC) is running its Black and Asian Leadership Initiative (Bali) scheme exclusively for potential BME leaders and targeted at those at team leader level or above.</p> <p>The initiative is a response to statistics which show that BME directors of social services are poorly represented. Just four out of 152 directors of adult services are BME and it is thought that the picture is similar in children's services.</p> <p>Last year's first outing of the scheme last was oversubscribed and it is expected to be the same this year. Alix Morgan, VSC's director of programmes says: \"The course offers a combination of practical career planning and recruitment as well as some generic development training. A lot of it is about [growing] their confidence as a group and how they can use their difference to make a difference.\"</p> <p>Kathy Freyer a team manager in children's services at Buckinghamshire county council with 20 years experience as a qualified social worker, was among the first Bali cohort. She says: \"The programme appealed because it gave me the opportunity to meet with and network with other managers from BME backgrounds. Although you are part of an organisation you can sometimes feel very isolated if you are the only BME manager.\"</p> <p>Samih Kalakeche became a social services director after more than 25 years and now heads adult services and health at Liverpool city council.</p> <p>Since his appointment four years ago, another BME head of service has been taken on \u2013 an indication, he says, of how the culture is changing. \"The statistics are awful and I think organisations should look at how they, as organisations, are promoting BME social care managers to climb up the ladder,\" he says. \"It's the glass ceiling issue which organisations and departments should take up. I think it's also about educating members.\"</p> <p>The Bali scheme is supported by the Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS), which says it is especially important for children's services to have a diverse leadership because it helps imbed culturally sensitivity.</p> <p>Andrew Webb, ADCS vice-president and corporate director for services for people at Stockport council, says: \"If you don't have [diversity] you are missing access to a perspective and a set of experiences on which your services depend. We need to be culturally literate because if we are not, services are not targeted as well as they could be.\"</p> <p>Lack of confidence and a scarcity of role models in senior positions to aspire to are seen as the main barriers to BME managers applying for senior roles. Freyer says: \"I think sometimes it can be that an opportunity doesn't present itself and sometimes it's an issue about not being seen as fitting what is required \u2013 the old boy school network.\"</p> <p>Meera Spillett, retired head of children's services at Oxfordshire county council and a Bali facilitator, sees lack of \"cultural competence\" in some organisations as another obstacle. \"You find the best organisations, those with the most fertile ground, are those which have looked at how their organisation is culturally competent in terms of meeting the needs of the service users and developing staff and being open to applications from wider communities.\"</p> <p>The Bali scheme, which organisers hope will become an annual programme, is taking place just as a pilot programme for BME leaders, run by the National Skills Academy for Social Care, comes to an end. That scheme involved 20 managers from across the care sector including local authority, third sector and private providers and included mentoring and networking opportunities. Managers also had the chance to design and deliver a specific local project in order to showcase their talents and potential.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.peterloomassacre.org/\">Peterloo massacre </a>on Monday 16 August 1819 - 193 years ago tomorrow - took place when a peaceful crowd, assembled to demand the reform of Parliament, was attacked by armed soldiers and yeomanry, leading to many deaths and injuries. The events of the day have been the subject of many books, novels, prints and poems, but the role of women has often been overlooked. </p> <p>As the reform movement gathered momentum in the spring of 1819, women stepped onto the public stage, setting up <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRfemale.htm\">Female Reform Societies </a>in a number of towns. Blackburn women led the way. On 5 July the Female Reformers, described as \"very neatly dressed for the occasion\", and each wearing a green favour in her bonnet or cap, attended an outdoor public meeting, at which they presented a Cap of Liberty made of scarlet silk to the chair, John Knight. Alice Kitchen made a short speech: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Will you Sir, accept this token of our respect to these brave men who are nobly struggling for liberty and life: by placing it at the head of your banner, you will confer a lasting obligation on the Female Reformers of Blackburn. We shall esteem it as an additional favour, if the address which I deliver into your hands, be read to the Meeting: it embraces a faint description of our woes and may apologise for our interference in the politics of our country. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>The Manchester Female Reform Society followed suit, issuing an address on 20 July, which was directed at other women, namely \"the wives, mothers, sisters and daughters of the higher and middling classes of society\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dear Sisters of the Earth, It is with a spirit of peaceful consideration and due respect that we are induced to address you, upon the causes that have compelled us to associate together in aid of our suffering children, our dying parents, and the miserable partners of our woes. Bereft, not only of that support, the calls of nature require for existence; but the balm of sweet repose hath long been a stranger to us. Our minds are filled with a horror and despair, fearful on each returning morn, the light of heaven should present to us the corpse of some of our famished offspring, or nearest kindred, which the more kind hand of death had released from the oppressor. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>The radical newspaper <em><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/26blackdwarf.html\">Black Dwarf</a></em>, produced by T.J.Wooler in London, warmly applauded the development:</p> <blockquote> <p>I have news to tell thee \u2013 news that will make thy heart leap with satisfaction; as I know thee to be to be an admirer of female heroism and a zealous advocate for the rights of women, as well as of the rights of man\u2026..Here the ladies are determined at last to speak for themselves; and they address their brother reformers in very manly language. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394735829\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345022653815/G.Crui.The-Bell-alliance-.jpg\" alt=\"peterloo\" width=\"460\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Cruikshank's take on Blackburn women</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Their political opponents reacted swiftly. The cartoonist <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRcruikshank.htm\">George Cruickshank </a>produced a caricature of the Female Reformers of Blackburn, for instance, and there were other sneers and slurs.</p> <p>The massacre followed a rally addressed by the radical orator <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/IRhunt.htm\">Henry Hunt </a>whose peaceable nature was described by many observers. Here's one:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Reformers\u2026seemed determined to make this a splendid day...in preparing flags and small bands of music, and in arranging matters for the approaching meeting. It is evident, however, from the great number of females, and even children, who formed part of the procession, that nothing was anticipated that could involve them in the least degree of peril.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Women were soon among the victims of the notorious attack which followed. Mary Fildes, who was on the platform, was truncheoned by special constables when she refused to let go of the flag she was carrying. She tried to leap to the ground, but a protruding nail caught her dress, leaving her suspended in mid-air. One of the mounted Yeomanry slashed at her and then seized her flag but miraculously she escaped serious injury. </p> <p>Jemima Bamford, who had accompanied her husband Samuel, a leading reformer, from Middleton, subsequently wrote a vivid account of her experiences on the field: </p> <blockquote> <p>By this time Mr. Hunt was on the hustings, addressing the people\u2026.The people shouted, and then the soldiers shouted, waving their swords. Then they rode amongst the people, and there was a great outcry, and a moment after, a man passed without hat, and wiping the blood off his head with his hand, and it ran down his arm in a great stream. </p> <p>The meeting was all in a tumult; there were dreadful cries; the soldiers kept riding amongst the people, and striking with their swords. I became faint, and turning from the door, I went unobserved down some steps into a cellared passage; and hoping to escape from the horrid noise, and to be concealed, I crept into a vault, and sat down, faint and terrified\u2026</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394735830\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345022785306/PRfemale1.jpg\" alt=\"Peterloo\" width=\"460\" height=\"348\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another bash at reforming women.

It was near this place and about this time that one of the Yeomanry was dangerously wounded, and unhorsed, by a blow from the fragment of a brick; and it was supposed to have been flung by this woman. </p> </blockquote> <p>At least 18 people were killed on the field or died later of their injuries, of whom four were women. These were Margaret Downes \u2013 sabred; Mary Heys - trampled by cavalry; Sarah Jones \u2013 truncheoned on the head by special constables; and Martha Partington, \u2013 crushed to death in a cellar. Of the 654 people listed as being injured, 168 were women. </p> <p>The Manchester Female Reformers flag , was put on display that evening in a shop on Oldham Road in the manner of a spoil of war. An angry crowd of women and children quickly gathered and threw stones, breaking the windows. The military were sent for, who read the Riot Act and then opened fire. They also arrested a number of women, including one whom it was alleged had \"talked loudly against the Prince Regent\", and said things \"it would not be proper to repeat\". There was further rioting outside the shop the next day. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394735831\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/3/1330791216959/peterloo-001.jpg\" alt=\"peterloo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaigners have fought successfully in recent years for better memorials of the massacre.

In the weeks after the massacre, the authorities also targeted female relatives of reformers, as detailed by Joseph Johnson in a letter published in the Black Dwarf on 29 September: </p> <blockquote> <p>Not content with multiplying indictments upon Mr Wroe, the intrepid proprietor of the <em>Manchester Observer</em>, and exasperated at his perseverance, and their incapacity to obtain possession of his person, the revengeful animals have directed all the engines of their prostituted authority to the persecution of his wife and children, who continue to sell that and other obnoxious publications. Twice have the mean violators of the law and deciders of justice held Mrs Wroe to bail, and twice have her children been taken out of his shop, and sureties been demanded for their appearance to answer the charge of having published scandalous libels, that told too much truth of these Manchester magistrates\u2026In addition to Mrs Wroe, the wife of one of the journeymen, Mrs Hough and her daughter, were arrested and confined in the New Bailey all night\u2026</p> </blockquote> <p><br>At the end of November the Female Reformers of Manchester issued an address to Wiiliam Cobbett, praising his endeavours on behalf of the reform movement and thanking him for his support when the women came under attack.</p> <blockquote> <p>It cannot be unknown to you, Sir, that our intentions have been vilified, and our characters traduced by the unprincipled scribes, of a venal and corrupt press. To you, in your excellent letter to the Female Reformers of Blackburn, we are indebted for a complete vindication of our motives, our conduct and our characters; you have refuted the calumnies of our enemies and proved our innocence and integrity. The days of chivalry are passed ; but in you the Female Reformers feel that they shall never want a sufficient advocate.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The female reformers were acting in support of their husband and brothers, the demand for rights for women lay some years off, but the example they set of political activity by women was a template for later movements.

  "<p>Portsmouth are on the brink of liquidation after the club's former owner Balram Chainrai dramatically withdrew his takeover bid, blaming \"negative criticism\" from fans \u2013 and claiming the club had \"suddenly received additional huge claims from former players and management\".</p> <p>Chainrai had been expected to complete the deal this week after the club's administrator, Trevor Birch of PKF, successfully offloaded the last remaining senior players from Portsmouth's wage bill.</p> <p>However, hours after the makeshift new team were beaten 3-0 in the Capital One Cup by Plymouth \u2013 whose fans held a collection to help Portsmouth's cause \u2013 Chainrai announced his company, Portpin, had pulled out.</p> <p>The decision means the club's last chance of survival appears to be an alternative bid by the Pompey Supporters Trust.</p> <p>Chainrai said in a statement released to Sky Sports News: \"Portpin Ltd regrets to announce that it is withdrawing its bid for Portsmouth Football Club. Unfortunately, our efforts to save the club once more from extinction have hit a wall of rejection and lacking co-operation from the administrator and other interested parties.</p> <p>\"We are not the ones who have caused the club to collapse and we are not the ones to choose PKF as administrators.</p> <p>\"As history has recorded, we sold the club over a year ago after saving it from liquidation and unfortunately found ourselves again fighting to try and save the club from another liquidation. Through this administration process over the last six months we have always had the club's best interest in mind \u2013 unlike many parties who were involved in the process.</p> <p>\"We repeatedly encouraged the administrator to find a new, willing and able buyer to take over the club \u2013 unfortunately he was unsuccessful in this job and couldn't find a buyer despite his promises.</p> <p>\"Later he approached us to be his safety net to save the club as he couldn't find a buyer. We agreed in the effort to avoid liquidation of the club.\"</p> <p>Chainrai's statement goes on to list his specific grievances, including heavy criticism of the administrators and their fees, \"the negative criticism and lack of support for our takeover by the fans of this club\", and, \"the fact that suddenly the club has received additional huge football creditors' claims from former players and management\".</p> <p>Chainrai also slams the Football League for deducting 10 points \"for no reasonable reason\" and questions the credibility of the alternative bid from the Supporters Trust.</p> <p>He adds: \"All of these facts have left us in a position that we no longer want to fight this battle, we have zero support to save the club therefore we formally withdraw our bid and our honest attempt at saving the club. We will sleep well knowing we did our utmost to save the club.</p> <p>\"We welcome and will assist anyone, including the Supporters Trust, to try and save the club in the coming days.\"</p> <p>The trust, which has the backing of a \u00a31.45m loan from the council, reacted positively to the news of Chainrai's withdrawal, calling it potentially \"the light at the end of the tunnel\".</p> <p>A trust statement said: \"We have today been advised that Balram Chainrai and his company Portpin have withdrawn their offer to purchase Portsmouth Football Club for a third time, leaving the way clear for the Pompey Supporters Trust to be able to take control of our club.</p> <p>\"We call on Mr Chainrai to do the decent thing and accept the PST offer to purchase his charge on the club, and therefore walk away from Pompey, regaining some of the money he has lost, and leaving the club in the hands of the people who will truly cherish it and ensure that it continues as both a business and a legacy for the future.</p> <p>\"SOS Pompey has campaigned for Mr Chainrai to finally leave Pompey and we hope that this latest news could be the light at the end of the tunnel, which ultimately returns the club to the fans.</p> <p>\"Portsmouth FC is the lifeblood of the fans and the city and we ask all supporters of the club, the people of Portsmouth and football as a whole, to support the work of the Pompey Supporters Trust in their continued efforts to secure its future.</p> <p>\"Pledges are still wanted and both these and donations can be made via <a href=\"http://www.pompeytrust.com\" title=\"\">www.pompeytrust.com</a>. SOS Pompey intends to hold a peaceful demonstration of our pride in our manager and players before this Saturday's game against Bournemouth at 2.15pm at the gates of Fratton Park, and we ask all fans to join us in showing how much we appreciate the work of the manager and staff of our magnificent club.\"</p>",
  "<p>Westminster city council publishes a charter for adult social care this week, setting out to service-users and third party providers the way it envisages care should be delivered.</p> <p>The charter is based on the idea \"that every person has the right to be treated with dignity, compassion and respect\", and was drawn up by the council's safeguarding team.</p> <p>Westminster's cabinet member for adults and health, councillor Rachael Robathan, said: \"The charter enshrines our beliefs in how people at Westminster should be treated. We've already produced a social care mandate about the services that the people of Westminster should expect, but our charter is about the type of treatment that they should expect. It is our pledge to service users.</p> <p>\"We use third party agencies, and it is also a way to explain what we expect from providers. It's about the culture.\"</p> <p>Robathan was involved in drawing up the charter before staff in adult social care teams gave their views. She adds: \"We had huge, tremendous feedback. We have a committed and dedicated team \u2013 it's the staff's charter really.\"</p> <p>The team manager at Westminster's north-east locality service, Deborah Knapp, shared her views on the first draft of the charter. \"Our first thoughts were: this is really just what we do,\" she said. \"The change for us is that we're opening that up for others to know and see. It's basically our bread and butter. It's our ethos, being given out to everyone else.</p> <p>\"As a manager it will also be useful for training and inductions for new staff, and it's empowering service users. For instance, it will make sure we are respecting religious and cultural beliefs.\"</p> <p>The council launched its independent living mandate last September, \"to help people live as independent and fulfilled lives as possible\" by taking responsibility for their own care. With Westminster reducing adult social care budgets, Robathan says the charter is a way to reassure those with concerns over services.</p> <p>\"We've had quite a bit of change and budgetary pressure handed down to us. People are worried when things change. After implementing change, it's important to reaffirm our commitment to people.\"</p> <p>However Paul Dimoldenberg, the leader of the Labour group on the council, is critical of the plans. He says: \"I'm concerned that the number people receiving help from the council has reduced considerably as criteria has been narrowed down. This is a short sighted unnecessary step, particularly as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jun/20/westminster-council-underspends-social-care-budget?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the council underspent on adult social care by \u00a35.6m</a> last year.</p> <p>\"Effectively older people are bearing the brunt of the cuts, which is an appalling situation considering the wealth of Westminster. In many ways it is half hearted; no matter how fine the words are or how well presented the document is, the cold hard facts are that fewer older people are getting help from Westminster City council.\"</p> <p>For Robathan, the issue is different: \"This is not a PR stunt, this is our commitment. It's not just about the service we provide, its about the way we provide it. If someone's visiting someone in the evening, but they're grumpy and they use the wrong name, then that's not good care. The charter goes right into the core of our services. I feel absolutely strongly about this. It comes right down to the small things.</p> <p>\"My mother-in-law was from the age where it was polite to call people by their last names, but when she went into hospital they called her by her first name, instead of Mrs Robathan. Her medical care was excellent, but they didn't treat her in the way that she wanted to be treated, I don't think they even realised. It was the small things that took away her dignity. It's not just about good services, it's about delivering them well.\"</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails for social workers and social care professionals.</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>Why is diversity and inclusion in the media so important?</strong></p> <p>Diversity of opinion and perspectives, and of course the different lense of people, are vital ingredients for a lively, balanced and enriched debate across all media, and I strongly feel journalism can play a powerful role in creating cohesion and understanding through dialogue.</p> <p>However, the media industry does attract criticism (in places, rightfully so) of being exclusive and not diverse enough, and I think it's fair to say that it is a heavily networked industry. Working in media, and journalism more specifically, is a complex yet rewarding career that does require a high degree of determination, know how, self-assurance and passion to succeed; opinion and perspective are paramount. So if we can promote pluralism through diversity, that is always a good thing.</p> <p><strong>Tell us about your role as head of diversity and inclusion at the Guardian?</strong></p> <p>I work across all areas of the business, including recruitment and development, editorial and commercial with regard to diversity and inclusion. I have overall responsibility for ensuring that our newspapers and websites are reflecting the societies in which we live and work.</p> <p>On an editorial level we reflect our values of independence and inclusiveness by not only ensuring a broader diversity of voices are heard within the papers and websites, but also by making sure our editorial coverage accurately reflects the diverse societies we live in.</p> <p>On a commercial level we aim to attract more readers from all sections of society. We can only continue to be an innovative brand by attracting the best talent from the widest pool and nurturing a diverse workforce with different outlooks and perspectives.</p> <p><strong>What kind of projects and initiatives are you currently working on with new writers?</strong></p> <p>I run workshops and pitching seminars for minority groups with our editors, designed to inject diverse voices into our editorial coverage and increase the breadth and depth of the minority voices we commission. These initiatives aim to better inform our commissioning editors across Life &amp; Style, G2, Features, Culture, Film &amp; Music, Books, Comment, Society, and Sport. We aim to show that there is a wealth of stories out there that we are perhaps not currently tapping in to as much as we should.</p> <p>This is part of our overall editorial diversity strategy to move editorial coverage of these groups away from stereotypes, towards inclusiveness and genuine representation \u2013 it's about showing the diversity within diversity.</p> <p><strong>Can you share some success stories?</strong></p> <p>These workshops have proved to be highly successful, with six workshops already resulting in 72 article commissions and many writers being commissioned more than once for the Guardian.</p> <p>One particular success story from these workshops is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/swinbourne-charlie\">Charlie Swinbourne</a>, a deaf writer. Since attending a workshop, Charlie has already written 17 articles. One in particular example is about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/31/academies-deaf-pupils-children\">government's withdrawal of funding for deaf children in the new academies</a> setup. As a result of Charlie's piece, the government reinstated the special support services funding of academies for a year.</p> <p>This shows how this type of initiative can provide a platform for a voice that ordinarily would not have been heard, and in this case caused a policy change. What's also great about this initiative is that it very much fits within our open journalism strategy, through which we are constantly encouraging participation and interaction with our journalism, and seeking expertise outside our own writers.</p> <p><strong>What would you say to anyone reading this?</strong></p> <p>The media industry is going through some tough times, with every media outlet suffering from a decline in print circulation. The Guardian has embraced a digital-first strategy in the last 12 months and believes this is the future. The digital world means there are many more opportunities for individuals to get their voices heard via blogging, commenting, and social media.</p> <p>I would say to anyone who is interested in journalism as a career, get out there, get on Twitter, start a blog and start producing content. Whether in 140 or 140,000 characters, form your own opinions on issues, and be prepared to argue. Become an expert in an area you are interested in or passionate about, be it sports, movies, music, politics or culture. Start writing about this in any way you can, and try to carve yourself a niche as an expert so people want to hear what you have to say. Digital platforms are a great place to build up a reputation for yourself \u2013 remember the best tweeters are not always famous.</p> <p><strong>Tell us more about your background, are you a writer too?</strong></p> <p>I started out as a freelance consultant and trainer working for various public and private sector organisations. I used to design and deliver training programmes for organisations using interactive theatre and forum techniques, such as Augusto Boal's theatre of the oppressed, as a way to tackle organisational inertia, by exploring the dynamics of power and using interventions to tackle oppression in all its forms.</p> <p>In terms of writing, I have been encouraged to write for the Guardian on diversity, which I am beginning to do more of now. I also am in the middle of writing a piece about my recent trip to Pakistan, a 30 year return home since visiting as a child; a historical and comical exploration of my Pakistani heritage and identity.</p> <p><em>A version of this blog <a href=\"http://www.britwriters.com/news/yasir-mirza-head-of-diversity-and-inclusion-at-the-guardian.html\">originally ran on Brit Writers</a></em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Hyperlocal media, a small but fast-growing sector, ought to be unregulated, writes Damian Radcliffe <a href=\"http://meejalaw.com/2012/08/13/damian-radcliffe-hey-regulator-leave-those-hyperlocals-alone/\">in a very long, but rewarding, article.</a> </p> <p>Here are the bones of the argument advanced by Radcliffe, author of <a href=\"http://damianradcliffe.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/here-and-now-uk-hyperlocal-media-today-now-available-as-a-scribd-document/\"><em>Here and now \u2013 UK hyperlocal media today</em></a> and an honorary research fellow at Cardiff university's journalism school... </p> <p><em>Open internet philosophy:</em> The web should be a predominantly unregulated space, provided that the law of the land is not being broken.</p> <p><em>Historic rules of regulation do not apply:</em> Broadcasting regulation is not a framework that logically transfers to the online space, which is virtually limitless. </p> <p><em>The (im)practicalities of enforcement:</em> Anyone can set up a hyperlocal website or channel for free, and just as easily dismantle it. It's therefore impossible to monitor them effectively.</p> <p><em>Concerned citizens and community journalism:</em> Active citizens reporting on what matters to them - journalism as volunteerism - should be nurtured, not stifled. Regulation is likely to reduce transparency and accountability, not increase it.</p> <p><em>Innovation:</em> With the online hyperlocal sector still in its infancy there is a risk that innovation would be stymied by unnecessary regulation.</p> <p>Radcliffe moves on to consider the case <em>for</em> regulation, noting that the three strongest arguments concern protection, credibility and parity for hyperlocal publishers.</p> <p>He is unconvinced by them and deals with each in turn. But I'm going straight to his conclusion. He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In my experience most hyperlocal outlets take questions of balance and accuracy very seriously and where they have an editorial agenda it is usually pretty clear.</p> <p>Just because you are unregulated, does not mean that your standards are any lower. </p> <p>Nor will being regulated suddenly mean that the public will view your content differently, that relationships with traditional media will transform overnight, or that late night telephone calls from aggrieved press officers will cease.</p> <p>Instead, we need to recognise that hyperlocal publishers are an increasingly important part of our media ecosystem. They can, and do, on occasion provide great content for other media outlets \u2013 acting as a local wire service. </p> <p>Hyperlocal outlets can also be a great way for traditional media to find new voices and talent, whilst for audiences they can help plug gaps in content provision \u2013 or provide a new level of ultra-local reporting.</p> <p>Nurturing and supporting the industry should be the aim of policy makers. And it does not need regulation to make this happen. Key challenges such as finding ways to develop partnerships, or unlocking legal training and support for hyperlocal publishers, can all happen without the need for regulatory intervention or frameworks.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Though Radcliffe doesn't tackle press regulation, this could be viewed as some kind of message to Lord Justice Leveson to keep his hands off hyperlocal outlets. Then again, I don't believe LJL is thinking too hard of getting into such a contentious area.</p> <p>For me, the key phrase occurs in Radcliffe's opening point about allowing freedom to reign as long as hyperlocal sites obey the law.</p> <p>The central reason for regulation is about preventing undesirable acts by big, mainstream media because that sector has the capability to set the national conversation and to trample over the reputations of individuals along the way.</p> <p>Regulation is about curbing power. Hyperlocals, by their nature, lack that power. That's why they deserve to be left alone. </p> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://meejalaw.com/2012/08/13/damian-radcliffe-hey-regulator-leave-those-hyperlocals-alone/\">Meeja Law</a></p>",

  "<h2>Getting into sound</h2> <p>When Steve left school, he wanted to work as a session guitarist; he was doing a BTEC in Performing Arts at Wrexham, but found himself fascinated with speakers and sound. \"I'd always look at sound and was fascinated with how it worked. It was more invisible as an art form in terms of setting it up, but sound was always this mysterious running in of cables.\"</p> <p>As his course progressed, Steve became more and more interested in sound design and he went on to train as a sound technician in Manchester. From there, he moved to London and secured one of his first jobs on a production of Dracula. The original sound designer couldn't be there for the technical rehearsal, so Steve had to take over at the last minute \u2013 that's when he had a moment of revelation.</p> <p>\"The director changed everything on the Saturday night before the show started,\" he said. \"I remember spending at least three nights, really late, changing all the sound set up. There was a moment at about 3am where I was in a control room, a few microphones over me, with all these pieces of celery and half opened melons \u2013 I was putting my hand in to get squidgy noises, making the sound of a stake going through a heart. I was thinking: this is a great job!\"</p> <p>Soon afterwards, he began working at the <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Barbican</a> as a member of the team he now leads. Much of what he knows was learned on the job as he helped change the set up between shows.</p> <h2>Working as a sound designer</h2> <p>Although there is a lot of rehearsing involved, Steve doesn't find the work monotonous; going from intimate stage shows to a production more like a rock concert keeps his job varied and challenging.</p> <p>\"Say you're doing the Tempest and want to involve the audience within the story from the beginning. Then you make sure you've got enough speakers around the auditorium so that you can bring waves crashing out from the stage through the auditorium.</p> <p>\"My job is really to facilitate all those requirements. Especially here at the Barbican, there's always something new in what you're trying to do.\"</p> <p>Productions at The Barbican are varied. Complicite's Master and Marguerita, for example, included lots of video and sound installation, but contrasting with that was Big and Small, a more abstract and subtle show.</p> <p>\"It requires a different way of thinking,\" said Steve. \"Then we've just done a piece called <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/theatre/event-detail.asp?ID=11928\" title=\"\">Einstein on the Beach</a>, which was having its British premier. It was a five hour long opera with twenty singers and ten people in a band, so our orchestra pit needed a monitor and all the singers had in-ear monitors.</p> <p>\"We put in split systems for every microphone that went in, allowing another three outputs to come out. It made this amazing piece of theatre, probably one of the things I'm proudest about that we've done here.\"</p> <h2>Getting experience in technical theatre</h2> <p>Steve took a degree in technical theatre, and said that it's a good place to start: \"Given the various disciplines of technical theatre \u2013 stage management, lighting, sound, stage work, scenic painting, prop painting \u2013 if you do a course at a good college, of which London has plenty, then it gives you the opportunity to try all those flavours.\"</p> <p>Initially Steve thought he was going to get into lighting when he started his BTEC, but experience changed his mind: \"I taught at Guildhall for a year and a half, and saw students having that same experience: going in thinking they were going to do one thing, then completely changing by the end of their three years.\"</p> <p>A college course can be a great place to get a feel for what aspect you might enjoy. But that's not to say it's the only way in; work placements are an excellent way to learn on the job. Many theatres and sound companies have schemes that could work for you.</p> <p>\"We're very strong on work placements here in my department,\" added Steve, \"I did a couple myself and they were really beneficial to me. At the moment we've got seventeen-year-old \u2013 he started as a work placement and worked really well with us. He's got one of the next two places on our apprentice scheme, so he'll spend the next 18 months here.</p> <p>\"He'll do three months in stage, lighting and sound, then choose which one he likes and do a further six to nine months in the department he wants to work in. It means we can nurture people on a more personal scale.\"</p> <p>Where you should look for experience opportunities depends on where you want to go. With a bit of research you can find out which companies work in the field you're interested in, and if you get in touch with them, they can tell you what they might have for you.</p> <p>\"If you like musical theatre, <a href=\"http://www.autograph.co.uk/sound/#/about/who_we_are/\" title=\"\">Autograph Sound</a> do most of the musicals in London. If you want to do theatre, I'd personally recommend places like the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Theatre</a>, <a href=\"http://www.almeida.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Almeida</a> or the Royal Court. They produce their own shows in-house, so you actually see how that process gets put together.\"</p> <h2>Keeping the passion for a theatre career</h2> <p>\"I was never any good academically,\" admitted Steve. \"I had a minimal amount of GSCEs but ended up being taken on due to my passion for sound and the excitement of having found something that I thought could be my career.\"</p> <p>Finding something you're passionate about is a big part of choosing a career. Once you've found that passion, it can sometimes get a bit lost in the day-to-day details of your job. Like any theatrical work, you provide other people with entertainment, and with the hours often keeping quite long and anti-social, it can get you down. Steve knows how he keeps himself switched on.</p> <p>\"If a production's been really tricky to get on, every so often I get a ticket, or go and stand in the auditorium. I don't watch the show necessarily.</p> <p>\"I watch the audience. It kind of reinvigorates the reason why you've done it. I did it with Einstein on the Beach \u2013 at the end, when they were doing twenty minute standing ovations, it's one of those moments where you're thinking: this is why we do it.\"</p> <p><em>This article was originally published by </em><a href=\"http://www.creative-choices.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Creative Choices</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/13/syria-opposition-groups-national-council\" title=\"\">conflict in Syria</a> has divided Syrian families, mine included. While my mother and I usually see eye to eye on Arab politics, Syria has caused heated debate between us. Our differences are not along the black and white lines of pro- or anti-regime, as many prefer to view the issue, but revolve around the likely after effects.</p> <p>My mother's concerns stem from a deep-seated suspicion of foreign (particularly western) interference in the Arab world \u2013 a suspicion validated by history \u2013 and the fact that her family belongs to two of Syria's numerous minorities: Christians and Armenians.</p> <p>I grew up on heartwarming stories of my mother being raised in a tolerant, secular society, where people of all faiths intermingled freely and happily. She speaks with nostalgia of helping her Jewish neighbour in Aleppo during the Sabbath, and of her marriage to my late father \u2013 a Muslim \u2013 during which religion was never an issue between them, or their families. These fond memories, and the increasingly sectarian nature of the conflict, shape her views.</p> <p>In a cruel twist of fate, my relatives in Aleppo \u2013 proud Syrians \u2013 are now forced to flee their homeland, the country that gave their parents' and grandparents' generations hospitality and sanctuary from Ottoman Turkish forces. In our regular phone calls they tell us of terrifying experiences that paint a picture of growing extremism that is under-represented in media coverage.</p> <p>My mother's concerns over sectarianism were first raised during George Bush's \"war on terror\", which she blames for intentionally radicalising people of all faiths and ethnicities across the Middle East to enable a policy of divide and rule, including in Syria, which she has visited annually ever since she left the country decades ago.</p> <p>To her, Syria's revolution has accelerated an existing trend because those powers that have traditionally espoused sectarianism in the region are intimately involved, under the false guise of democracy and human rights. She believes Syria is headed for the type of vicious civil war seen in neighbouring Iraq just a few years ago, and in neighbouring Lebanon before that.</p> <p>I understand and sympathise with most of her views, and share her concerns about developments in Syria, particularly in the light of the difficulties that more homogenous Arab societies have recently faced when overthrowing their dictators.</p> <p>Despite all that, though, I still firmly believe in the need for Bashar al-Assad and his regime to go. There is simply no feasible or acceptable scenario whereby he and his party can continue their decades-old, repressive, totalitarian rule.</p> <p>Bashar may be secular but, like his late Iraqi counterpart Saddam Hussein, he is an equal opportunities oppressor, and the rich history of coexistence in both countries was not created by the Ba'ath parties. Indeed, my mother's inclusive childhood predates the Assad dynasty.</p> <p>If a post-Assad Syria is to avoid the abyss of civil war, under no circumstances should minority rights be hindered. However, while it must be acknowledged that support for Assad is not limited to minorities, and opposition to him does not come solely from the Sunni Muslim majority, there are those who resent what they see as minorities' complicity or silence regarding his crackdown.</p> <p>At the same time, one cannot ensure minority rights by repressing the majority (as has happened to Syria's Sunnis) \u2013 that, too, is a sure way to civil war. So it is incumbent on the opposition to reassure the minorities, and incumbent on minorities to stand with their revolutionary compatriots. Basically, the rights of all should be considered, respected, and treated as equal.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the opposition has been divided from the outset and has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10319497\" title=\"\">failed to come up with a unified vision</a> for post-Assad Syria. Continued defections from the government and army, while boosting opposition morale, have also raised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10364972\" title=\"\">suspicions about the motives</a> of some recent defectors, and added to the ranks of those with differing agendas and backers seeking possible leadership roles.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Free Syrian Army has become something of a franchise that covers all manner of fighters without a unified command and control structure. This has led to credible reports of human rights abuses and possible war crimes, such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10370094\" title=\"\">execution of Assad loyalists</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/08/20128671921529472.html\" title=\"\">targeting of state media</a>.</p> <p>If opposition tactics become no better than those of the regime, the legitimate goals and aspirations of the revolution will be lost, morally and practically.</p> <p>The regime has cynically played on sectarian fears to maintain its rule, with some in the opposition at times taking the bait.</p> <p>Assad's brutal reaction to the revolution made its militarisation inevitable: with the continued killings of peaceful protesters, calls for reform became demands for regime change, those who preferred a peaceful transition saw the need to defend themselves, and an insistence against foreign help turned into pleas for assistance.</p> <p>The crisis in Syria has gained a sinister momentum that the best of intentions may no longer be able to stop. It is high time to end the \"finger-pointing and name-calling\" that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/02/kofi-annan-resigns-syria-envoy\" title=\"\">caused Kofi Annan to resign</a> as the UN and Arab League envoy to Syria, and to acknowledge that there is no single narrative to the conflict.</p> <p>Just as the disagreements in my own family will never cause animosity between us, so too must differences in wider Syrian society be treated as among one family. Of course this is easier said than done under the present circumstances, but it must be done \u2013 the very social fabric of the country is at stake. What we need is reflection and sanity on all sides before it is too late.</p> <p>To use the analogy of the Middle East as a playground for outside powers, the situation in Syria is akin to onlookers egging on two people to fight. Syrians must keep in mind that it is those who are fighting, not those encouraging them, who will bear the scars.</p>",

Singer and guitarist Liza Casullo decided to go solo, but she took some time off to develop her acting career. A couple of months ago she released her first official album, Velvetbonzo. It's a great record in which a minimalistic acoustic sound blends with psychedelia, garage and folk.

Those violins and cascading treble guitars which duck and weave out of the chorus provide a nice backdrop to the band's quieter moments and slight Arcade Fire stylings that mesh together so well. If Felusine is a pitch into the musical void, someone needs to sign these guys real soon.</p> <p> <em>AUSTRIA</em>: <a href=\"http://walzerkoenig.tumblr.com/\"><em>Walzerk\u00f6nig</em></a><br><a href=\"http://plaided.org/\"><strong>Plaided</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://www.unet.univie.ac.at/~a0700994/map/2012/08/Plaided%20-%20Freaks%20And%20Geeks%20%28Austria%29.mp3\"><strong>Freaks And Geeks</strong></a><br>\"Would you run run run run run run run to my place and watch Freaks and Geeks all night long?\" We totally would! Plaided is an acronym that was inspired by a Girls Rock Camp participant's band and thus matches the feminist background of Veronika Eberhart and Julia Mitterbauer. The duo will go on a US tour with Grass Widow in September and also record a 7\" record there.

Besides being a couple in real life, the duo revisit the vigor of 70s garage, Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and the apathetic rage of The Jesus And Mary Chain.

The fact that one of the members hails from an area with a rich folk tradition seems to have seeped into their music, which has a pagan-ish, medieval quality to it. Elsewhere it is possible to detect influences as varied as The Go-Go's and The Monkees, The Doors and Talking Heads, and there is a blend of good old-fashioned \"played\" instruments and electronic drones and effects, but always the folk elements shine through.</p> <p> <em>FINLAND</em>: <a href=\"http://www.glue.fi/\"><em>Glue</em></a><br><a href=\"http://satellitestories.com/\"><strong>Satellite Stories</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3135709/glue/map/satellite_stories_anti_lover_finland.mp3\"><strong>Anti-Lover</strong></a><br>Indie quartet Satellite Stories have delivered several party songs over the last couple of years to become one of Finland's most promising acts. Anti-Lover is the first single from their debut album Phrases To Break The Ice which will be released this autumn.

Hailing from Nancy, they released their first EP in April, in which each of their songs show a different influence, all while staying very danceable. In just four songs, they manage to sound like The Rapture, Foals and Foster The People. Clarity is their most electro-pop oriented song and is supported by a killer beat and an impeccable production.

Although they connect to the old Kraut by playing with Michael Rother and Dieter Moebius, their music sounds refreshing. First single Ausland keeps the typical meandering melodies and synths but brings back rock to Krautrock. Their debut album, due out this month, incorporates many more influences and will, of course, be released on Bureau B.</p> <p> <em>GREECE</em>: <a href=\"http://mysteryfallsdown.blogspot.com/\"><em>Mouxlaloulouda</em></a><br><a href=\"http://last-drive.net/\"><strong>The Last Drive</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://map.super45.cl/map-2012-08/The_Last_Drive_-_Child_Of_The_Sky_-_Greece.mp3\"><strong>Child Of The Sky</strong></a><br>The Last Drive are regarded as one of the most important and influential bands of the Greek underground music scene. They were formed 30 years ago and, through their explosive live performances and unique sound, became rapidly popular. After their dynamic comeback in 2007 (they split up in 1995), they released Heavy Liquid, a crafted mix of intense, raw rock 'n' roll songs, blurred melodies, addictive fuzz guitar riffs and almost primitive drums that unites disparate musical elements into blasts of noisy cohesion and howling passion. Right before the recording of their new LP, they have just unleashed News From Nowhere, an imprint of the difficult times we're living.</p> <p> <em>ICELAND</em>: <a href=\"http://rjominn.is/\"><em>Rj\u00f3minn</em></a><br><a href=\"http://www.jonassigurdsson.com/\"><strong>J\u00f3nas Sigur\u00f0sson</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://rjominn.is/wp-content/static/2012/07/Jonas-Sig-Thyrnigerdid-Radio-Master.mp3\"><strong>\u00deyrniger\u00f0i\u00f0</strong></a><br>This is the first single from J\u00f3nas Sigur\u00f0sson's upcoming third album, \u00dear Sem Himinn Ber Vi\u00f0 Haf (\"Where The Sky Touches The Sea\").

With the influence of Native Tongues, G-funk and post-Dilla movements, they have created Al Comp\u00e1s Del Soul, a humorous and fresh album that can be downloaded for free on their website. Por Insurgentes is one of their most interesting tracks. Aside from those swell samples, they've pictured an imaginary trip on one of the most important avenues of Mexico City, Insurgentes, which happens to be the longest road that crosses the city north to south, and shows most of its contradictions and emblematic places.</p> <p> <em>PERU</em>: <a href=\"http://sideoftheblog.blogspot.com/\"><em>SoTB</em></a><br><a href=\"http://herzchenschmerzchen.bandcamp.com/\"><strong>Herzchenschmerzchen</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/17778857/Herzchenschmerzchen%20-%20Tic%20Tac%20%28Peru%29.mp3\"><strong>Tic Tac</strong></a><br>Herzchenschmerzchen, a word written in German and difficult to pronounce, is the name of Maria Jose Jordan's solo project.

His most recent EP boasts three layered tracks that highlight this idiosyncratic mix of influences, ranging from local acts like Superaquello to international names such as The Postal Service. En La Playa is a powerful tune featuring guest vocals by Carolina Martinez. With a dreamy pop quality that reminds us of waves slowly crashing at the beach at dusk, the song also addresses Puerto Rico's current state of affairs and the alarming apathy that seems to have taken over its inhabitants.

  "<p>Standard Chartered shares jumped after the London-based bank fended off threats by a New York regulator to revoke its banking licence for alleged breaches of US sanctions that it is claimed left the financial system vulnerable to corrupt regimes and weapons and drug dealers.</p> <p>The shares rose 3% when the market opened in London, even though <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/14/standard-chartered-pay-fine-regulator\" title=\"\">the bank agreed to pay a $340m (\u00a3220m) penalty</a> \u2013 a sum expected to rise once the bank settles with other US authorities investigating the breaches, which allegedly took place between 2001 and 2007.</p> <p>Analysts had expected the shares \u2013 which have slumped from \u00a316 since the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) levelled the damning charges last Monday \u2013 to rise because, despite the embarrassment of the fine, the bank's crucial banking licence was preserved.</p> <p>But the chief executive, Peter Sands, remains under intense pressure because the increase to \u00a314.10 still leaves the bank's shares much further to go to regain their losses.</p> <p>Analysts at UBS said: \"The aggregate of this fine, plus any additional recompense to other regulators, could total less than 1% of Standard Chartered's equity and the DFS fine represents around 6% of our current earnings forecast for Standard Chartered, suggesting the company will be able to absorb this cost and still deliver a 10th successive year of record profits.\"</p> <p>The settlement was made by Sands even though last week he had come out fighting, insisting the DFS order contained inaccuracies. It remains an embarrassment for the bank that only two weeks ago was claiming it was \"boring\" with a better culture than rivals hit by scandals.</p> <p>A week ago, the DFS said that Standard Chartered had left the US financial system \"vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes, and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial information used to track all manner of criminal activity\".</p> <p>Sands had flown in to New York on Monday ahead of a hearing with the DFS scheduled for Wednesday, but that has been adjourned. The bank is still in discussions about the final settlement but it is expected that inspectors from the DFS will be installed at the bank's office in New York and the bank will \"permanently install personnel\" in New York solely to ensure it adheres to money laundering laws.</p> <p>Benjamin Lawsky, the head of the DFS, claimed that Standard Chartered schemed to hide 60,000 transactions valued at about $250bn which breached sanctions with Iran. Sands admitted to only 300 breaches, with a much smaller value of about $14m.</p> <p>Lawsky had said he could withdraw the bank's licence but has dropped the threat although his statement announcing the settlement insisted both sides had agreed that the \"conduct at issue\" covered $250bn \u2013 the full amount of his original order.</p> <p>The UBS analysts added: \"While this is not final closure on the matter with Standard Chartered continuing to be investigated by other US/UK regulatory agencies, it was the DFS action that elevated the issue of non-compliance here to a point that potentially threatened Standard Chartered's ability to operate its US clearing business through NY and thus provided the greatest threat to its business model.\"</p> <p>The fine dwarfs the $5m that the bank had argued its breaches should require it to pay on the basis of a scale used by the US government's office of foreign assets control (Ofac) with which the bank is still in talks.</p> <p>Standard Chartered has admitted since 2010 that it has been discussing potential breaches of sanctions but was caught out by the decision by the DFS to publish its allegations while Sands was on holiday.</p>",
  "<p>The government has launched a review into cosmetic surgery following the breast implant scandal, which could lead to tighter controls over advertising and the way private clinics operate.</p> <p>Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of the NHS, is leading the review at the request of Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. Professor Keogh is <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/publichealth\" title=\"\">calling for the public to share their own experiences and give their opinions </a>on what should be done to better regulate a controversial private industry that is often accused of exploiting vulnerable people.</p> <p>The PIP breast implant scandal exposed shortcomings within the cosmetic surgery industry. Some leading private clinics did not have records of which patients had been given the implants which were filled with industrial silicone and more likely than others to leak. The review is expected to consider an implants register.</p> <p>But many feel tougher regulation and checks are needed for clinics offering what are often considered more minor procedures, such as dermal fillers and laser treatment. There are also serious concerns over the qualifications of those who call themselves cosmetic surgeons.</p> <p>\"The recent problems with PIP breast implants have shone a light on the cosmetic surgery industry,\" said Professor Keogh. \"Many questions have been raised, particularly around the regulation of clinics, whether all practitioners are adequately qualified, how well people are advised when money is changing hands, aggressive marketing techniques, and what protection is available when things go wrong.</p> <p>\"I am concerned that too many people do not realise how serious cosmetic surgery is and do not consider the life-long implications \u2013 and potential complications \u2013 it can have.\"</p> <p>Keogh is concerned that the public is more concerned about costs than safety when considering cosmetic surgery. The department of health released a survey of 1,762 people showing that two-thirds (67%) of those questioned said cost was a factor but only 54% said they considered the qualifications of the doctor and only 44% undergoing surgery and 36% opting for other treatments thought about aftercare.</p> <p>The review will look at regulation and safety of products and the skills and qualifications of those who carry out procedures. It will consider how to ensure the clinics have systems in place to care for patients during and after treatment, how to ensure people get accurate information, time to reconsider before embarking on treatments, and how complaints should be managed.</p> <p>Peter Walsh, chief executive of AVMA (Action against Medical Accidents), pointed out that previous attempts to reform the cosmetic industry had fallen short. A review in 2005 under then chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson recommended statutory regulation of Botox injections, dermal fillers and laser treatments, but the department of health did not accept the need.</p> <p>\"My fear is that there is a political resistance to introducing any form of statutory regulation,\" said Walsh whose organisation has since helped patients who have suffered harm as a result of those procedures. \"It has become somewhat politically incorrect to introduce regulation. That ideology in our opinion seems to have trumped patient safety in a number of cases.\"</p> <p>The Royal College of Surgeons and professional associations welcomed the review. Consultant plastic surgeon Tim Goodacre, chair of the professional standards committee of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, said they had campaigned long and hard for a register, but warned that \"the remit [of the review] is huge - I'm not sure how they will satisfy the public's desire to see something done without masses of legislation.\"</p>",

Other finds this year, including caps of tooth enamel, a glass bead necklace, a scrap of ancient textile and bone chips, also fit into the growing jigsaw of life in the 'new Britain'.</p> <p>Prof Ian Haynes, who led a team of Newcastle University archaeologists and 42 volunteers with site director Tony Wilmott, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>This has been a tremendously fruitful season the highlights of which will keep archaeologists talking for many a year. The altar found this year had also been used as ballast to support the walls of a huge timber building in use in the decades following Roman rule in Britain.</p> <p>We have recovered the plans of the buildings on the site and they show at least two phases of construction. The local cemetery appears to have been in use at the same time as other famous early Christian sites at Whithorn and at Hoddom in nearby Dumfriesshire, and would probably have been used between the fifth and seventh centuries AD. We await the results of radiocarbon dating \u2013 expected early next year - eagerly in the hope of getting a more precise fix on the period of use.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394729101\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345009134144/Maryport3.jpg\" alt=\"Maryport archaeology\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Haynes, left, and Tony Wilmott at the excavations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Three more summer seasons of excavation are planned in the current programme, helped by a range of supporters including the <a href=\"http://www.hadrians-wall.org/\">Hadrian's Wall Trust</a> whose director of world heritage and access, Nigel Mills, says: </p> <blockquote> <p>This year's finds at Maryport contribute to the growing body of evidence from across Hadrian's Wall, including sites such as <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/birdoswald-roman-fort-hadrians-wall/\">Birdoswald </a>and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/audio/2009/aug/28/archaeology-vindolanda-roman-forts\">Vindolanda</a>, that occupation continued through the fifth and sixth centuries.</p> <p>The end of Roman imperial administration did not mean that everything came to a stop and the country descended into chaos. Administration became more localised and people had to fend for themselves but the natural tendency would have been to keep things going as best they could.</p> <p>Christian religion may have been an important element helping to bind society together in troubled times.&#xa0; The garrisons of the former Roman forts are also likely to have stayed put for several generations. Tthey had been locally recruited and would have been firmly rooted to their local areas.&#xa0; They probably provided the nucleus of the warrior bands that supported local leaders who filled the power vacuum following the end of Roman rule.</p> <p>The finds give new insights into our understanding of the period following the end of Roman rule that laid the foundations for the eventual emergence of the Britain we know today.</p> </blockquote> <p>Other work in nort Cumbria has shown <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/apr/06/hadrians-wall-views-walks\">DNA links</a> between today's population and Roman soldiers from north Africa who formed the garrison along the Solway end of the Wall.

I have given up on xxx as they seem rather disorganised and wouldn't now consider working for them in any case.</em></p> <p><em>Should there be no further response, I think I'll give this up and work for my son-in-law\u2026</em></p> <p><em>I should say that I've never experienced such a consistent lack of response when working with voluntary organisations in other areas. I surmise that the groups are:</em></p> <p><em>1. Seriously under staffed and cannot cope with the demands which are placed upon them.</em></p> <p><em>2. Are required for funding purposes to advertise for volunteers, but don't really want them.</em></p> <p><em>3. Are using informal networks of people they already know (a kind of old boys' network).</em></p> <p><em>4. There are too many groups. It may be better to reduce the number and then combine resources, facilities, finance and personnel.</em></p> <p><em>It's quite a bleak outlook for the Prime Minister's 'big society'. I'm sorry that this might appear somewhat pessimistic and I do appreciate your efforts; so I'll give the final charity I've contacted a chance to reply and if there is none, I'll leave it at that\"</em></p> <p>While the email is certainly not typical, it's a story that I am increasingly hearing from people who want to volunteer. They are taking time to get in touch with organisations, and hearing nothing in return. Don't get me wrong, I work with a very large number of fantastic organisations, and I fully appreciate how busy volunteer managers can be. I too work part-time, and unlike some volunteer centres we are funded and open for only 24 hours a week. I do understand the pressures we are all under \u2013 funding cuts, limited resources, growing demand for our services from both service users and those who want to volunteer.</p> <p>But I can't abide poor customer service and I question why some in the voluntary and community sector think that it doesn't matter. I do think point 1 raised above is true \u2013 we are seriously understaffed and some organisations can't cope with the demands, but it saddens me to think that 2 and 3 could possibly be true in any cases. As for his point 4, is there some truth in what he is saying?</p> <p>In the private sector, your reputation is incredibly important, and in today's increasingly competitive market delivering poor customer service simply isn't acceptable. Look at sites like <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Trip Advisor</a> \u2013 what other people think can literally make or break your business, and all of those ratings are based on customers experiences of the service received. So why is it alright for the voluntary sector to think that the same doesn't apply? Are we in a position to choose who volunteers for us?</p> <p>To a degree, I think this is becoming true with the increase in demand for volunteering roles we are seeing \u2013 I know more and more organisations who are \"picky\" about who they take and who they don't because they are in a position to do so with supply of volunteers outstripping demand. But surely that goes against the idea that volunteering is inclusive, and that it is an incredibly valuable way to help some people who are disadvantaged take the first steps? It actually makes me sad, angry even, that those organisations will no longer give people a chance.</p> <p>One girl I know recently was rejected from an admin support role because she was nervous about answering the phone. Instead of taking the time to support her and to introduce her to this aspect of the role gradually, the organisation turned her down outright. This has done nothing for her confidence, or for recognising the great IT skills she was bringing with her. Their loss is my gain, she's now volunteering for me \u2013 no phone answering required, until she wants to.</p> <p>So voluntary organisations, is it time we became more accountable for delivering poor customer service? We are all fighting cuts to funding, frantically gathering outcomes to prove our worth, but if the job we are doing is not up to scratch in the first place, why should we be allowed to continue? Volunteers are often the life blood of our organisations, and if we treat them so badly then we deserve what we get. Let them vote with their feet and go elsewhere, and hold us accountable by providing the negative feedback so that others can make informed choices too.</p> <p>It is time we raised our game.</p> <p><em>Caroline Shead is volunteer centre manager for Harrogate and Area Council for Voluntary Service.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, has agreed to grant Julian Assange asylum, officials within Ecuador's government have said. The WikiLeaks founder has been holed up at Ecuador's London embassy since 19 June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/19/julian-assange-wikileaks-asylum-ecuador\" title=\"\">when he officially requested political asylum</a>.</p> <p>\"Ecuador will grant asylum to Julian Assange,\" said an official in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, who is familiar with the government discussions.</p> <p>On Monday, Correa told state-run ECTV that he would decide this week whether to grant asylum to Assange. Correa said a large amount of material about international law had to be examined to make a responsible, informed decision.</p> <p>Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, indicated that the president would reveal his answer once the Olympic Games were over. But it remains unclear if Assange will be allowed to leave Britain and fly to Ecuador, or the move amounts to little more than a symbolic gesture.</p> <p>At the moment he faces arrest as soon as he leaves the embassy for breaching his bail conditions.</p> <p>\"For Mr Assange to leave England, he should have a safe pass from the British [government]. Will that be possible? That's an issue we have to take into account,\" Pati\u00f1o told Reuters on Tuesday.</p> <p>Government sources in Quito confirmed that despite the outstanding legal issues, Correa would grant Assange asylum \u2013 a move that would annoy Britain, the US and Sweden. They added that the offer was made to Assange several months ago, well before he sought refuge in the embassy, and following confidential negotiations with senior London embassy staff.</p> <p>An official with knowledge of the discussions said the embassy had discussed Assange's request. The British government, however, \"discouraged the idea\", the official said. He described the Swedish government as \"not very collaborative\".</p> <p>The official added: \"We see Assange's request as a humanitarian issue. The contact between the Ecuadorean government and WikiLeaks goes back to May 2011, when we became the first country to see the leaked US embassy cables completely declassified ... It is clear that when Julian entered the embassy there was already some sort of deal. We see in his work a parallel with our struggle for national sovereignty and the democratisation of international relations.\"</p> <p>However, on Tuesday night after the Guardian broke the story Correa wrote on Twitter: \"Rumour of asylum for Assange is false. There is still no decision on the subject. I await report from [Ecuadorian] foreign office.\" Assange retweeted the message.</p> <p>Assange took refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations of sexual misconduct. He is said to be living in one room of the diplomatic building, where he has an internet connection.</p> <p>Ecuadorian diplomats believe Assange is at risk of being extradited from Sweden to the US, where he could face the death penalty. Assange's supporters claim the US has already secretly indicted him following WikiLeaks' release in 2010 of US diplomatic cables, as well as classified Afghan and Iraq war logs.</p> <p>Correa and Pati\u00f1o have both said that Ecuador will take a sovereign decision regarding Assange. They say they are seeking to protect Assange's right to life and freedom. On Monday the state-run newspaper El Tel\u00e9grafo <a href=\"http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=49722&amp;Itemid=2\" title=\"\">confirmed that a decision had been made</a>, although it did not specify what that decision was. It said senior officials had been meeting to iron out the last legal details.</p> <p>Two weeks ago Assange's mother, Christine, paid Ecuador an official visit, following an invitation from the foreign affairs ministry. She met with Correa and Pati\u00f1o, as well as with other top politicians, including Fernando Cordero, head of Ecuador's legislature. Both Pati\u00f1o and Ms Assange appeared visibly touched during a press conference, which had to be briefly suspended when Ms Assange started crying.</p> <p>Ms Assange held several public meetings in government buildings, and in one instance she was accompanied by the head of her son's defence team, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, the former Spanish judge who ordered the London arrest of Chile's General Pinochet.</p> <p>Other top political figures in Ecuador have been vocal about the government's support of Assange's bid. \"Our comrade the president, who leads our international policy, will grant Julian Assange asylum,\" said Mar\u00eda Augusta Calle, a congresswoman of the president's party, and former head of the Sovereignty, Foreign Affairs and Latin American Integration Commission during the 2008 Constitutional Assembly, during a meeting with Ms Assange.</p> <p>Over the past year and a half, Assange has remained in touch with Ecuador's embassy in London. In April, he interviewed President Correa for his TV show on Russia Today, the English-language channel funded by the Russian government. The interview, which lasted 75 minutes, included a pally exchange in which Assange and Correa bonded over freedom of speech and the negative role of the US in Latin America. At one point Correa joked: \"Are you having a lot of fun with the interview, Julian?\" Assange replied: \"I'm enjoying your jokes a great deal, yes.\"</p> <p>Correa has made international headlines this year for what critics have called a government crackdown on private media. Analysts say that granting the WikiLeaks founder asylum could be a way for him to depict himself as a champion of freedom of speech ahead of the February 2013 presidential elections, in which he is expected to run again.</p>"
