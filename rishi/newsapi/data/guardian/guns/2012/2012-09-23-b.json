  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The number of tax evasion cases being pursued by HM Revenue &amp; Customs has fallen to its lowest level in five years, according to a survey which comes amid a pledge by the Liberal Democrats to crack down on individuals who are not paying their fair share of tax.</p> <p>Lawyers Pinsent Masons said the number of serious tax evasion cases \u2013 with more than \u00a350,000 of suspected tax evasion \u2013 had fallen by a quarter in the past year as the government prepares to hand HMRC <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/21/budget-osborne-business-tax-dodges\" title=\"\">a general anti-abuse rule from April 2013</a>. Meanwhile the number of raids undertaken in the 2011-12 tax year has risen to 499 from 196 in the 2010-11 tax year.</p> <p>In 2011-12 there were 3,346 suspected tax avoidance cases, down from the 4,506 in 2010-11, according to data compiled by the law firm.</p> <p>Phil Berwick, director at Pinsent Masons, said: \"HMRC is now prepared to use its strongest anti-evasion measures in cases that would previously have been regarded as quite modest in size\".</p> <p>But, he said, the fall in the number of cases \"doesn't really gel with the idea that there is a substantial and growing threat to public spending because of tax evasion\".</p> <p>Lib Dem Treasury chief Danny Alexander said that anyone with assets of more than \u00a31m would face scrutiny by tax inspectors \u2013 effectively putting extra 200,000 individuals under the spotlight of HMRC's affluence unit.</p> <p>Business secretary Vince Cable also told another Sunday newspaper that he wanted to take action against \"shady\" rich people using offshore tax havens in a \"systematic and cynical\" way.</p> <p>Berwick pointed to a tough approach being taken by HMRC, using the case of <a href=\"http://hmrc.presscentre.com/Press-Releases/Surrey-plumber-jailed-for-tax-evasion-67d85.aspx\" title=\"\">Melvyn Careswell, a plumber who was jailed for 12 months for tax evasion after failing to register his earnings for five years with the tax authorities</a>. \"A few years ago, a \u00a350,000 tax evasion case would almost certainly have been subject to civil, rather than criminal prosecution,\" Berwick said.</p>",
  "<p>For all the money invested, the returns for Manchester City can look patchy even if they do happen to be the reigning Premier League champions. In an undistinguished encounter it was only right that there should be a draw. The 1-1 score was born out of muddle and mistake, particularly when no one in the Arsenal defence prevented Joleon Lescott from heading the opener in the first half.</p> <p>Even so, the deeper impression was of uncertainty in both sides. It often looks as if City are still engaged in the search for an identity that will lead to victories and also win over the public with enticing football. Somewhere along the way, the balance between stringency and entertainment has been lost.</p> <p>There might also be a suspicion that the manager, Roberto Mancini, has mixed purposes. The public will not remember with much fondness the conservatism that used to be so marked in City's play, but a free-wheeling approach has its own difficulties. Defending is a bit of a conundrum for the time being.</p> <p>Lescott did not even get off the bench in the Bernab\u00e9u on Tuesday, when City let a 2-1 lead slither into a 3-2 defeat by Real Madrid over the course of the last four minutes. Here they might at least see the key error as one whose consequences were remarkable. When a corner falls to a defender such as Laurent Koscielny no one anticipates chest control and a handsome shot into the top corner.</p> <p>Arsenal still have potency despite a disturbing sale that they felt unable to prevent when the player in question was entering the last year of his contract. There may have been anguish at the Emirates over the loss of Robin van Persie to Manchester United, but the real ache that the club feels is not concerned primarily with the scoring of goals.</p> <p>The comparisons are biting. While Arsenal's defence was breached 49 times in the Premier League last season as they finished third, Sunderland, 10 places beneath them shipped three goals fewer. The loss of the centre-half Thomas Vermaelen to illness looked ominous before this match had even begun.</p> <p>Arsenal, however, have been aiming for more stringency of late and had seemed sound until that unanticipated breakthrough by the hosts. The goalkeepers Wojciech Szczesny and Lukasz Fabianski are both injured at present, but Vito Mannone hardly looked as if he were quaking until he was party to the lapse that cost a goal. In truth, each team were well-intentioned rather than lethal.</p> <p>These two clubs, despite the contrast between City's extravagance and Arsenal's comparative austerity, had blandness in common. Mancini's men are still in the throes of shaping the identity of his lineup. On occasion, there are days when the rigour of old is beyond reach and the intention of playing expansive football does not lead to any sort of brilliance.</p> <p>There is no question that Mancini has a very good set of players, but virtuosity is not especially apparent. David Silva is gifted indeed, yet no one would quite say he is among the small elite of footballers who can change the course of a key match at the highest level.</p> <p>A mercurial presence does exist, but it is understandable that Mancini does not count on Mario Balotelli. The forward came on for just the last five minutes. His partial estrangement is no shock and his volatility is undisputed. Not starting him is a tacit admission of failure so far by Mancini. This is a most taxing case and anyone can guess that it drives him to anger and exasperation.</p> <p>In all likelihood, however, Balotelli's first touch and obvious potential mean that he ought to be at the heart of City's ambitions. It is no fault of Mancini's that the forward is an erratic player who can bring havoc on his own club as much as the opposition, but the manager cannot really enjoy the luxury of dispensing with him.</p> <p>Edin Dzeko, who started, can be relied on for a steady contribution and some goals, but he will not strike fear into defences. Carlos Tevez, too, is renowned for good reasons and he can commit himself in a way that is alien to Balotelli, but it is the latter, at the age of only 22, who still has it in him to evolve into an even more devastating attacker.</p> <p>Mancini is to be envied for the budget and the means already at his disposal, but he will know that City, before long, must show they are genuine contenders for the Champions League. There was no indication of that against Arsenal. If City are to join the elite, they will have to find a way of tapping Balotelli's ability to the full.</p>",

Drummers clatter behind him, their music held on the edge of orbit and then, afterwards, he pleads with the audience at Cafe Oto in&#xa0;London, to \"knit your hearts together\", to fight sexism and racism.&#xa0;This is not your average free-jazz performance.</p> <p>Born Leo Smith in 1941, this part-time teacher and ethnomusicolgist added the name Wadada when he became a Rastafarian in the early 1980s, and then preceded this with Ishmael after converting to Islam the following decade. Not only did he keep his former names, he kept the dreads, now salt-and-pepper flecked. Currently a faculty member at the Herb Alpert School of Music at the California Institute of the Arts, Smith has released scores of recordings over the years \u2013 but only now has he finished his life's major work, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/b22bbe50-de0a-47d9-9e94-90e3e541d297\" title=\"\">Ten Freedom Summers</a>, which he began in 1977 and is now releasing as a four-CD box set.</p> <p>Smith started out playing in school marching bands in Mississippi, before moving on to blues and R&amp;B, styles he talks about with deep respect. \"Robert Johnson's blues,\" he says when we meet, holding forth with the air of a mystic. \"That's as heavy as Nietzsche talking about life and death.\"</p> <p>He blossomed in the crucible of late 1960s Chicago to become a major figure in free jazz, surrounded by fellow sonic&#xa0;explorers including Henry Threadgill, Roscoe Mitchell and Anthony Braxton. \"He found another way to organise music,\" Threadgill tells me. \"The actual realisation of that [music] on an improvisational level is still something that the individual players have to deal with, but he's got a landscape and a way of negotiating through that landscape that he can put in front of you, and then it's up to you to navigate that. He always had his own way of doing things.\"</p> <p>Smith joined the boundary-pushing jazz organisation, <a href=\"http://aacmchicago.org/\" title=\"\">the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM)</a>, and was \"hazed\" by the other members, who talked loudly through his first performance as a sort of initiation ritual. \"I felt it was very mean-spirited and it pissed me off completely,\" he remembers. \"And I played stronger, and I played stronger, and finally they all bust back on stage and joined me. And after that you kind of know you belong there. They've put you out in the water by yourself, you've swam across this vast ocean of whatever the expectation was, and you've conquered it.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F45716391&amp;amp;show_artwork=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F45716391&amp;show_artwork=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Listen to Song: Martin Luther King, Jr. (excerpt) from Ten Freedom Summers </p> <p>With Ten Freedom Summers, Smith originally set out to document a decade of civil rights activism, from the Brown v Board of Education trial of 1954, which ruled that separate schools for black and white students were unconstitutional, to the signing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. But his span grew to encompass <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott\" title=\"\">African-American slave Dred Scott's unsuccessful legal challenge against slavery in 1857</a> and the events of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/11/911-ground-zero-american-century\" title=\"\">9/11</a>, taking in the Vietnam War, JFK's assassination, and what he calls \"the myth of a free press\" along the way. \"I wanted to identify that the black experience <em>is</em> American experience,\" he says, keen for it not to be seen as \"a kind of racial isolation\".</p> <p>Each piece uses a single event as its focus. The Freedom Riders Ride, for instance, tackles the murder of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner at the hands of the police and the Ku Klux Klan, after they took part in interstate bus journeys that challenged segregation on public transport. \"It's about that ride, the contemplation, anticipation and anxiety. I start with the point where they see the headlights and the police car stops. I don't try and make a pictorial image, I look for the psychological thread \u2013 what did they feel, in my imagination, and what do I feel, from their experience?\"The pieces are performed by his Golden Quartet ensemble, improvising jazz musicians that Wadada has played with for decades, along with and the Southwest Chamber Music, a 10-person outfit; the score is a blend of&#xa0;standard&#xa0;notation, with space for free improvisation, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNrQ7Pdij0w\" title=\"\">Ankhrasmation</a>, a symbolic and pictographic method of scoring developed by Smith himself in the late 60s. To get the orchestral performers to improvise, he simply wrote music that was impossible to play. \"My instruction to them was: while you're playing this and you cannot completely play it correctly, keep going forward. At some point, it's going to break down completely \u2013 and at that point you're improvising.\"</p> <p>The result is extraordinarily moving \u2013 the freedom of the playing, and the democratic process of group improvisation, emulates the freedoms&#xa0;the civil rights movement was fighting for. So</p> <p>Is America's hostility to Muslims a new challenge? \"It's constantly creating new membership into Islam,\" he replies. \"People say: why do they hate Muslims so much? And they get in there and see this teaching is different from how it's perceived from the outside.\"</p> <p>And w, with a black man in the White House, have the battles sketched out in Ten Freedom Summers been won? \"When Barack Obama was elected,\" says Smith, \"it immediately brought out all the differences in society. He's been called a new Hitler, the devil in return, he's been called nigger. I relate this kind of stuff to growing pains: when a child has a tantrum, they're&#xa0;learning how to respect the rule of law.\" He cites \"very bright\" black politicians like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/03/us-midterm-elections-2010-usa\" title=\"\">Deval Patrick</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/cory-booker-chris-christie-irresistible-force\" title=\"\">Cory Booker</a> as being part of a new generation: \"They know the sky's the limit now.\"</p> <p>Smith, who is now 70, recently recorded an album of duets with South African drummer Louis Moholo-Moholo, put together as the pair toured&#xa0;from the Azores to Finland. \"I've got that Beethoven energy, that Stravinsky energy,\" he grins. \"And it's all a gift from the Creator.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Ten Freedom Summers is out on Cuneiform.

  "<p>The licensed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/badger-cull-public-safety-risk?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">killing of badgers in parts of Gloucestershire and Somerset</a> could achieve a number of things. It could further advertise the unwelcome existence of bovine tuberculosis in British dairy herds. It could polarise opinion in the countryside and unite political opposition everywhere else. It could cost the farmers involved more than they could gain. It will almost certainly provoke active protest and put even more pressure on already hard-pressed police forces.</p> <p>What it will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\" title=\"\">almost certainly not do is limit bovine tuberculosis</a>, even in the target zones of Gloucestershire and Somerset. It might be helpful to list those things that are certain. Human tuberculosis is a dangerous disease. Bovine tuberculosis is a real problem for dairy farmers \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/20/dairy-farmers-asking-fair-days-pay\" title=\"\">who in any case have been paid too little for their milk</a> and who have been going out of business for decades \u2013 and the disease lives on in the wild badger population. But by 1996, a policy of identification and slaughter had reduced the incidence of bovine TB in dairy herds in England and Wales to less than half a per cent, and the risk of direct transmission to humans has \u2013 with the pasteurisation of milk \u2013 long ago become negligible. The last and most <a href=\"http://www.bovinetb.info/docs/krebs.pdf\" title=\"\">systematic examination of the link between badgers and bovine TB</a> found that, indeed, there was transmission, and proposed a series of systematic, randomised controlled trials over a sustained period to see whether culling could provide an answer. In 2003, the government, farmers, public health officers and wildlife campaigners got the answer: shooting and gassing did not eliminate, and could possibly spread, the disease. That may be because badgers disturbed in one area could migrate, taking the infection with them. The answer, delivered by Lord Krebs and the distinguished statisticians and zoologists who examined the results, could hardly be clearer: killing will not solve the problem. Lord Krebs's scientific credentials are not in doubt. He was trusted by successive British governments to head the Natural Environment Research Council, and to chair the Food Standards Agency. And he has just described the<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19623931\" title=\"\"> latest plan as a \"crazy scheme\".</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/20/09/2012/135304/Farmers-Weekly-quizzes-Brian-May-on-bovine-TB.htm\" title=\"\">Brian May, guitarist for Queen, has condemned the policy</a>, so has Sir David Attenborough, so of course <a href=\"http://www.badger.org.uk/Content/Home.asp\" title=\"\">has the Badger Trust</a>. Once again, a British government has chosen to <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7314/full/467368a.html\" title=\"\">seek the best possible scientific advice and then ignore it</a>, and to embark on a plan that almost everybody knows will not work; and in the course of doing so to slaughter not just a protected species, but one of the most charismatic mammals of the ancient British countryside. At the end of the exercise, England's dairy farmers will still be no better off, and the wild landscape will be a great deal poorer. Crazy seems too mild an epithet.</p>",
  "<p>It is five and a half months since the last Grand National and six and a half to the next one. It is a Grade 3 handicap chase, a race which, were it funded in accordance with the Horsemen's Group's tariff, would be worth half as much as Saturday's Ayr Gold Cup. And yet, in the middle of September with the Arc imminent and Frankel due to race for the last time a fortnight later, the National has been the main talking point of the week.</p> <p>For that we can largely thank the British Horseracing Authority, which succumbed to the pressure to \"do something\" after two horses died during the race in April. As a result the National will now take place over four miles and three and a half furlongs, rather than the previous four miles and four, in the hope that the mayhem which often surrounds the start and the run to the first fence will be eliminated or at least reduced. Research will also be conducted into the design of the famous fences, in an attempt to make its central \"core\" more forgiving.</p> <p>But there will be no cut in the maximum field of 40 horses while a call by Gavin Grant, the chief executive of the RSPCA, for the removal \u2013 not modification, removal \u2013 of Becher's Brook has also been resisted. As soon as they are off and running the 2013 Grand National will look little different from any other over the past 20 years.</p> <p>Whether the same will be true of the 2014 version, however, is another matter, because what the latest modifications suggest is that, when it comes to the world's most famous steeplechase, the BHA is no longer in control. Instead it is at the mercy of events and, when another horse dies in the National \u2013 as will almost certainly happen within the next three years \u2013 it will again feel obliged to react.</p> <p>Over time the Grand National as we have known it faces death by a thousand minor modifications. Historic and significant though it is, however, a greater cause for concern is the fact that the arguments, and rhetoric, to which the BHA responds whenever a horse dies at Aintree could just as well be directed against the sport on the other 364 days of the year.</p> <p>The RSPCA claims to be interested in animal welfare but Grant's public comments on the National seem to draw directly from the rights-based agenda of groups like Animal Aid, which does not believe in the use of animals for anything at all and would like to see a vegan Britain with no leather shoes or handbags. Grant said after April's race that the deaths of Synchronised and According To Pete were \"totally unacceptable\", when it is inherent in the staging of the race \u2013 indeed any race \u2013 that horses will sometimes be injured or die.</p> <p>The same line was echoed by David Muir, the RSPCA's equine consultant, who also suggested last week that, while the organisation \"does not want to ruin\" the Grand National, \"we want to go and watch a race at Aintree, we don't want to watch horses that are dying\".</p> <p>The implication that the rest of us <em>do </em>want to watch horses that are dying is an interesting one, indeed insulting. But variations on the theme have been trotted out by the abolitionists at Animal Aid for years and now the same tone has started to emerge from an organisation which boasts the Queen as its patron.</p> <p>The Grand National is turning into racing's glass jaw. Opponents of the National itself and racing as a whole will keep pounding away at it until the sport's knees start to buckle. It is good for Aintree, good for Liverpool and very good indeed for betting turnover on the first Saturday in April but the annual fallout from this one race among many thousands each year is becoming unbearable. The BHA needs to get its gloves up and mount a proper defence but, if it is unwilling or unable to do so, it would be better to throw in the towel now and spare us further punishment.</p>",
  "<p>Last September, when Barack Obama's approval ratings were in the low to mid-40s and a clear majority of Americans said he did not deserve a second term, veteran pollster Charlie Cook described his ideal Republican opponent as \"odourless and colourless\". With unemployment and the deficit so high and gridlock so stubborn, he explained, a challenger who did not repel independents or unnecessarily antagonise Obama's base should have little problem defeating the president.</p> <p>The trouble was that almost all the&#xa0;Republican contenders during the primary were either extremely colourful or, as candidates at least, stank. There was Newt Gingrich, who wanted to build&#xa0;permanent bases on the moon and, according to his ex-wife, demanded an open three-way relationship with the mistress who is now his current wife; Ricky Perry, who could not&#xa0;remember his own talking points; and Herman Cain, who was accused by several women of sexual harassment and proudly stated that he did not know the&#xa0;name of the president of \"Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan\". Each, for a while, was a frontrunner.</p> <p>So when people wonder how Mitt Romney became the party's standard-bearer they need to first remember just&#xa0;how low the standards were. To make sense within the Republican party was, almost by definition, to appear nonsensical outside it. More credible candidates took a look at what you'd have to say and do to compete and decided to sit the election out.</p> <p>After a fortnight of gaffes and worsening poll numbers critics have rounded on Romney's campaign (which is turning into a circular firing squad) and his personal failings as a candidate (a wooden, awkward campaigner who can't relate to ordinary people). But his flaws as a nominee are only properly understood in the context of the flaws of the party that nominated him. Romney's not letting the party down. Quite the opposite. He's a far more plausible, competent and rational a candidate than it deserves. The urgent question is not why, for the time being, the race seems to be getting away from him, but how he has remained in contention for so long.</p> <p>True, this was supposed to be the Republicans' election to lose. When Obama was pitted against a (\"colourless\", \"odourless\") generic Republican in polls, he was defeated. The trouble is, the more voters see what qualifies for a generic Republican the less keen they are to have anything to do with one.</p> <p>It's not difficult to see why. Over the past few years Republicans have come across as particularly heartless. During one primary debate, Texas governor Rick Perry was cheered when introduced as a man who'd overseen 234 executions. <a href=\"https://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2012/08/15/Joe-the-Plumber-calls-for-fence-start-shooting-to-protect-border.html\" title=\"\">Joe the Plumber, now a congressional candidate in Ohio</a>, spelled out his plan for dealing with illegal immigration: \"Put a fence on the damn border and start shooting.\"</p> <p>They are none too keen on facts. <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/2012-romney-mormonism-obamas-religion.aspx\" title=\"\">The percentage of Republicans who believe Obama is a Muslim</a> has doubled in the last four years and now stands at about one in three, the same proportion of Republicans in the swing state of Ohio who still <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/03/limbaugh-and-birthers.html\" title=\"\">do not believe Obama was born in the US</a>. They are not particularly interested in consensus, either. Two thirds of Republicans said they'd rather have a congressperson who <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/boehners-problem-his-party-doesnt-like-compromise/2011/07/11/gIQAnUdMhI_blog.html\" title=\"\">stuck to their principles no matter what than one who compromises to get things done</a>. They give little impression of being inclusive. Asked <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voters-explain-why-blacks-pick-democratic/2012/08/29/2d85f792-f238-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_graphic.html\" title=\"\">why they thought so many African Americans supported Democrats,</a> the most common opinion among those with a view was because of welfare dependency. And they appear stuck in the past. More than one in four Republicans in Mississippi and one in five in Alabama believe interracial marriage should be illegal while closer to two thirds in <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/03/other-notes-from-alabama-and-mississippi.html\" title=\"\">both states do not believe in evolution</a>.</p> <p>Such is the extremeness and eccentricity of those to whom Romney must appeal for votes and cash. To be fair, Romney saw this coming. In February he said: \"It's very easy to excite the base with incendiary comments ... I'm not willing to light my hair on fire to try and get support. I am who I am.\" By July, Sarah Palin was insisting the least he could do was throw a match and some gasoline her way. (\"Well, light our hair on fire, then!,\" she told Fox News). Now he's in the process of fullblown self-immolation, and his candidacy is on the brink of crashing and burning.</p> <p>\"The appearance of a Republican party almost entirely composed of ideological conservatives is a new and historically unprecedented development,\" writes Geoffrey Kabaservice in Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party. \"It is only in the last decade or so that movement conservatism finally succeeded in silencing, co-opting, repelling, or expelling nearly every competing strain of Republicanism from the party.\"</p> <p>The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza points out: \"<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/03/12/120312fa_fact_lizza\" title=\"\">The number [of Republicans] who call themselves liberal is now close to the number who describe themselves as&#xa0;Aleut or Eskimo.</a>\"</p> <p>Romney understands this problem. He was raised with it. At 17 he saw his father George, the governor of Michigan, walk out of the 1964 convention after a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/10/31/141857420/new-republic-mitt-romneys-parent-trap\" title=\"\">futile bid to challenge its extremist platform</a>. That year, Gerald Ford symbolically nominated George from the floor, describing him as a man who \"has never let the temporary glitter of expediency obscure the path which his integrity dictated he must follow\".</p> <p>And, as the governor of Massachusetts, one of the most reliably liberal states in the country, Mitt has worked with it. In September 2002, shortly before his gubernatorial election, he told a group of pro-choice campaigners that for all their differences they could make common cause. Melissa Kogut, then head of Massachusetts Naral, told the Washington Post. \"He closed the meeting by taking on a just-between-us tone and saying, essentially, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/09/AR2007100902146.html\" title=\"\">'You need Republicans like me. And the party needs candidates like me, because this issue is killing the party.'\"</a></p> <p>The party he tried to save is dead; the party he represents now deluded. When he speaks candidly within it, he exposes its contempt for the poor in particular and the electorate's intelligence in general. When he speaks carefully outside of it, he exposes its contradictions: driven by the fringe but appealing to the mainstream. This is not a problem of Romney's making; it's the problem that made Romney's candidacy possible.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 September 2012. The original said that, of Republicans asked why they thought so many African Americans supported Democrats, \"more than half said because they are government dependents while one in six insisted it was because they were uninformed, ignorant or uneducated\". This was based on numbers in a poll that were assumed to be percentages, but were in fact raw counts.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below)</strong></p> <p>The Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), or People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, is an Iranian dissident group that has been <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm\">formally designated</a> for the last 15 years by the US State Department as a \"foreign terrorist organization\". When the Bush administration sought to justify its attack on Iraq in 2003 by accusing Saddam Hussein of being a sponsor of \"international terrorism\", <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/iraq/decade/sect5.html\">one of its prime examples</a> was Iraq's \"sheltering\" of the MEK. Its inclusion on the terrorist list has meant that <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2339B\">it is a felony</a> to provide any \"material support\" to that group.</p> <p>Nonetheless, a large group of prominent former US government officials from both political parties has spent the last several years receiving substantial sums of cash to give speeches to the MEK, and have then become vocal, relentless advocates for the group, specifically for removing them from the terrorist list. Last year, the Christian Science Monitor <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0808/Iranian-group-s-big-money-push-to-get-off-US-terrorist-list\">thoroughly described</a> \"these former high-ranking US officials - who represent the full political spectrum - [who] have been paid tens of thousands of dollars to speak in support of the MEK.\" They include Democrats Howard Dean, Ed Rendell, Wesley Clark, Bill Richardson, and Lee Hamilton, and Republicans Rudy Giuliani, Fran Townsend, Tom Ridge, Michael Mukasey, and Andrew Card. Other prominent voices outside government, such as Alan Dershowitz and Elie Wiesel, <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/02/28/3091892/iranian-dissident-group-enlists-jewish-voices-in-bid-to-get-off-us-terror-l\">have been enlisted to the cause</a> and are steadfast MEK advocates. </p> <p>Money has also been paid to journalists such as <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/carl_bernstein_mek.php\">The Washington Post's Carl Bernstein</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/03/clarence-page-mek-speech-fee_n_1645795.html\">the Chicago Tribune's Clarence Page</a>. Townsend is a CNN contributor and Rendell is an MSNBC contributor, yet those MEK payments are rarely, if ever, disclosed by those media outlets when featuring those contributors (indeed, Townsend <a href=\"http://outfront.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/28/townsend-on-iranian-plot-to-kill-americans-should-be-consider-an-act-of-war/\">can go on CNN to opine on Iran</a>, even urging that its alleged conduct be viewed as \"an act for war\", with no disclosure whatsoever during the segment of her MEK payments). Quoting a State Department official, CSM detailed how the scheme works:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'Your speech agent calls, and says you get $20,000 to speak for 20 minutes. They will send a private jet, you get $25,000 more when you are done, and they will send a team to brief you on what to say.' . . . The contracts can range up to $100,000 and include several appearances.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On Friday, the Guardian's Washington reporter Chris McGreal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/iran-mek-group-removed-us-terrorism-list\">added substantial information</a> about the recipients of the funding and, especially, its sources. As he put it, the pro-MEK campaign \"has seen large sums of money directed at three principal targets: members of Congress, Washington lobby groups and influential former officials\", including the GOP Congressman who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Rogers.</p> <p>What makes this effort all the more extraordinary are the reports that MEK has actually intensified its terrorist and other military activities over the last couple of years. In February, <a href=\"http://rockcenter.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/02/08/10354553-israel-teams-with-terror-group-to-kill-irans-nuclear-scientists-us-officials-tell-nbc-news\">NBC News reported</a>, citing US officials, that \"deadly attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists are being carried out by [MEK]\" as it is \"financed, trained and armed by Israel's secret service\". While the MEK denies involvement, the Iranian government has echoed these US officials in insisting that the group was responsible for those assassinations. NBC also cited \"unconfirmed reports in the Israeli press and elsewhere that Israel and the MEK were involved in a Nov. 12 explosion that destroyed the Iranian missile research and development site at Bin Kaneh, 30 miles outside Tehran\". </p> <p>In April, the New Yorker's Seymour Hersh <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/04/mek.html\">reported</a> that the US itself has for years provided extensive training to MEK operatives, on US soil (in other words, the US government provided exactly the \"material support\" for a designated terror group which the law criminalizes). Hersh cited numerous officials for the claim that \"some American-supported covert operations continue in Iran today.\" The MEK's prime goal is the removal of Iran's government.</p> <p>Despite these reports that the MEK has been engaged in terrorism and other military aggression against Iran - or, more accurately: likely because of them - it was <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/09/21/169369/us-to-remove-mek-from-terrorist.html\">announced on Friday</a> the US State Department will remove MEK from its list of terrorist organizations. This event is completely unsurprising. In May, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/15/likely_victory_for_mek_shills/\">I noted</a> the emergence of reports that the State Department would do so imminently. </p> <p>Because this MEK scam more vividly illustrates the rot and corruption at the heart of America's DC-based political culture than almost any episode I can recall, I've <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/02/10/israel_mek_and_state_sponsor_of_terror_groups/\">written</a> <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/06/report_us_trained_terror_group/\">numerous</a> <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/03/12/washingtons_high_powered_terrorist_supporters/\">times</a> about it. But now that the de-listing is all but official, it is worthwhile to take note of the five clear lessons it teaches:</p> <h2>Lesson One: There is a separate justice system in the US for Muslim Americans.</h2> <p>The past decade has seen numerous \"material support\" prosecutions of US Muslims for the most trivial and incidental contacts with designated terror groups. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that any Muslim who gets within sneezing distance of such a group is subject to prosecution. Indeed, as I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/conservatives-democrats-free-speech-muslims\">documented last week</a>, many of them have been prosecuted even for core First Amendment activities: political advocacy deemed supportive of such groups. </p> <p>When they're convicted - and marginalized Muslims, usually poor and powerless, almost always are - they typically are not only consigned to prison for decades, but are placed in America's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/03/03/134168714/guantanamo-north-inside-u-s-secretive-prisons\">most oppressive and restrictive prison units</a>. As a result, many law-abiding Muslim Americans have become petrified of donating money to Muslim charities or even speaking out against perceived injustices out of fear - the well-grounded fear - that they will be accused of materially supporting a terror group. This is all part of the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/16/personalizing_civil_liberties_abuses/\">pervasive climate of fear</a> in which many American Muslims live.</p> <p>Yet here we have a glittering, bipartisan cast of former US officials and other prominent Americans who are swimming in cash as they advocate on behalf of a designated terrorist organization. After receiving their cash, Howard Dean and Rudy Giuliani <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/opinion/sunday/an-iranian-cult-and-its-american-friends.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all\">met with MEK leaders</a>, and Dean actually declared that the group's leader should be recognized by the west as President of Iran. That is exactly the type of coordinated messaging with a terrorist group with the supreme court found, in its <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-89\">2010 Humanitarian Law v. Holder ruling</a>, could, consistent with the First Amendment, lead to prosecution for \"material support of terrorism\" (ironically, numerous MEK shills, including CNN's Townsend, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/03/12/washingtons_high_powered_terrorist_supporters/\">praised the supreme court for its broad reading of that statute</a> when they thought, correctly, that it was being applied to Muslims).</p> <p>Yet other than a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/12/ed-rendell-investigated-mujahideen-e-khalq_n_1340566.html\">reported Treasury Department investigation</a> several months ago to determine the source of Ed Rendell's MEK speaking fees - an investigation that seems to have gone nowhere - there has been no repercussions whatsoever from this extensive support given by these DC luminaries to this designated terror group. Now that MEK will be removed from the terror list, there almost certainly never will be any consequences (as a legal matter, the de-listing should have no impact on the possible criminality of this MEK support: the fact that a group is subsequently removed from the list does not retroactively legalize the providing of material support when it was on the list).</p> <p>In sum, there are numerous American Muslims sitting in prison for years for far less substantial interactions with terror groups than this bipartisan group of former officials gave to MEK. This is what New York Times Editorial Page Editor Andrew Rosenthal meant when <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/liberty-and-justice-for-non-muslims/\">he wrote back in March</a> that the 9/11 attacks have \"<em>led to what's essentially a separate justice system for Muslims</em>\". The converse is equally true: America's political elites can engage in the most egregious offenses - torture, illegal eavesdropping, money-driven material support for a terror group - with complete impunity.</p> <h2>Lesson Two: The US government is not opposed to terrorism; it favors it.</h2> <p>The history of the US list of designated terrorist organizations, and its close cousin list of state sponsors of terrorism, is simple: a country or group goes on the list when they use violence to impede US interests, and they are then taken off the list when they start to use exactly the same violence to advance US interests. The terrorist list is not a list of terrorists; it's a list of states and groups which use their power to defy US dictates rather than adhere to them.</p> <p>The NYU scholar Remi Brulin has <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/03/14/terrorism_20/\">exhaustively detailed</a> the rank game-playing that has taken place with this list: Saddam was put on it when he allied with the Soviets in the early 1980s, then was taken off when the US wanted to arm and fund him against Iran in the mid-1980s, then he was put back on in the early 1990s when the US wanted to attack him. </p> <p>And now, with the MEK, we have a group that, at least according to some reports, appears to have intensified its terrorism, and yet they are removed from the list. Why? Because now they are aligned against the prime enemy of the US and Israel - and working closely with those two nations - and are therefore, magically, no longer \"terrorists\". As the Iran experts Flynt and Hillary Mann Leverett <a href=\"http://www.raceforiran.com/by-delisting-the-mek-the-obama-administration-is-taking-the-moral-and-strategic-bankruptcy-of-america%E2%80%99s-iran-policy-to-a-new-low\">wrote on Friday</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Since when did murdering unarmed civilians (and, in some instances, members of their families as well) on public streets in the middle of a heavily populated urban area (Tehran) not meet even the US government's own professed standard for terrorism?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>They answered their own question: \"We have seen too many times over the years just how cynically American administrations have manipulated these designations, adding and removing organizations and countries for reasons that have little or nothing to do with designees' actual involvement in terrorist activity.\" In other words, the best and most efficient way to be removed from the list is to start engaging in terrorism for and in conjunction with the US and its allies (i.e. Israel) rather than against them.</p> <h2>Lesson Three: \"Terrorism\" remains the most meaningless, and thus the most manipulated, term in political discourse.</h2> <p>The US government did not even pretend that terrorism had anything to do with its decision as to whether MEK should be de-listed. Instead, they used the carrot of de-listing, and the threat of remaining on the list, to pressure MEK leaders to adhere to US demands to abandon their camp in Iraq. But what does adhering to this US demand have to do with terrorism? Nothing. This list has nothing to do with terrorism. It is simply a way the US rewards those who comply with its dictates and punishes those who refuse.</p> <p>Terrorism, at least in its applied sense, means little other than: violence used by enemies of the US and its allies. Violence used by the US and its allies (including stateless groups) <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/15/the_sham_terrorism_expert_industry/\">can never be terrorism</a>, no matter how <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/toxic-legacy-of-us-assault-on-fallujah-worse-than-hiroshima-2034065.html\">heinous</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/000873.shtml\">criminal</a>.</p> <h2>Lesson Four: Legalized influence-peddling within both parties is what drives DC.</h2> <p>MEK achieved its goal by doing more than merely changing the beneficiaries of its actions from Saddam to the US and Israel. It also found a way - how it did so remains a mystery - to funnel millions of dollars into the bank accounts of key ex-officials from both parties, a bipartisan list of DC lobbyist firms, and several key journalists. In other words, it achieved its policy aims the same way most groups in DC do: by buying influence within both parties, and paying influence-peddlers who parlay their political celebrity into personal riches.</p> <p>So pervasive is this scam that most people have become utterly numb to it (that's because people are <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/cynicism-as-enabling-force-for-power.html\">willing to acquiesce to most evils when they become perceived as common</a>; that acquiescence is often justified as worldly sophistication). As a result, there was no pretense here to hide these sleazy transactions. The very idea that Ed Rendell suddenly woke up one day and developed an overnight, never-before-seen passion for the MEK and Iran policy is just laughable. But the former Pennsylvania governor is a key advocate to enlist - he remains well connected within the Democratic Party and now has an important platform on MSNBC - so on the payroll he went. </p> <p>Once the bipartisan list of DC officials receiving cash from MEK became known, it became almost impossible to imagine any outcome other than this one. As one person tweeted after reading this State Department decision: any American billionaire could easily have his birthday declared a national holiday by simply spreading the cash around enough to DC political and media figures on a bipartisan basis.</p> <h2>Lesson Five: there is aggression between the US and Iran, but it's generally not from Iran.</h2> <p>Over the last decade, the US has had Iran <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/12/04/george_orwell_on_the_evil_iranians/\">almost entirely encircled</a>, thanks in part - only in part - to large-scale ground invasions of the nations on its eastern and western borders. Some combination of Israel and the US have <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html\">launched cyberwarfare at the Iranians</a>, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/another-iranian-nuclear-scientist-murdered-in-tehran-1.374898\">murdered their civilian scientists</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/western-official-israel-is-behind-recent-iran-explosion-1.395512\">caused explosions</a> on <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/report-explosion-rocks-iran-city-of-isfahan-home-to-key-nuclear-facility-1.398312\">its soil</a>. The American president and the Israeli government continuously and publicly <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/obama-all-options-remain-on-the-table-to-prevent-a-nuclear-iran-1.416405\">threaten to use force against them</a>.</p> <p>And now, the US has taken a key step in ensuring that a group devoted to the overthrow of the regime, a group that sided with Saddam in his war against Iran, is able to receive funding and otherwise be fully admitted into the precincts of international respectability. Just imagine if Iran took steps to legitimize an American rebel group that has long been devoted to the overthrow of the US government and which has a long history of serious violence on US soil.</p> <p>Not just the Iranian government, but also most of its citizens, are likely to perceive this de-listing as exactly what it is: yet another act of aggression toward their nation. As the Christian Science Monitor said of the group, it is \"widely despised inside Iran\". But the US has now officially offered a clear gesture of legitimization, if not support, for this group, one that only exacerbates the war-threatening tensions between the two nations.</p> <h2>UPDATE</h2> <p>Several commenters have raised questions about the motives of Dershowitz and Wiesel in supporting MEK. While motives can never be known with certainty - one can attempt only to make inferences based on conduct and circumstances - it was the JTA, the self-described \"global news service of the Jewish people\", <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/02/28/3091892/iranian-dissident-group-enlists-jewish-voices-in-bid-to-get-off-us-terror-l\">which reported their involvement</a>, and they suggested the motive was not any receipt of money but rather MEK's alignment with Israel:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The names on the growing list of influential American advocates to de-list the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK -- known in English as the National Council of Resistance of Iran -- suggest an effort to give the bid a pro-Israel imprimatur. . . . </p> <p>\"On the record, the people involved insist there is no Israel element to what they say is a humanitarian endeavor to remove the movement's followers from danger.</p> <p>\"'I don't see any Israel issue at all,' Dershowitz told JTA in an interview, instead casting it in terms of Hillel's dictum, 'If I am only for myself, who am I?'</p> <p>\"Off the record, however, figures close to the campaign use another ancient Middle Eastern dictum to describe the involvement of supporters of Israel: 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'\"</p> <p>\"A source close to the effort to bring pro-Israel voices into the initiative cited reports that Israel has allied with the MEK, which reportedly maintains agents in Iran and in the past has published details of Iran's nuclear weapons program.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A separate JTA article reporting on the de-listing noted that \"Iranian Americans sympathetic to the plight of MEK enlisted the support of a number of pro-Israel figures, including Nobel Peace laureate and Holocaust memoirist Elie Wiesel; Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz; and Irwin Cotler, the former Canadian justice minister.\" The original sentence has been clarified to reflect this report.</p>",
  "<p><sup>\"</sup>Helloooh!\" shouts a slightly undressed man from the top window. \"Down in a second.\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paddyashdown\" title=\"\">Paddy Ashdown</a> pounds down the stairs and opens the door, a little breathless. No socks, no shoes, shirt not quite buttoned, belly bursting from unbelted trousers. He apologises, and explains he wasn't expecting me so early. \"Right,\" he says, leading me to the kitchen of his London home, where a pack of fags and a packet of salmon lie on the table. \"Would you like some salmon?\"</p> <p>\"Paddy, it's 9.15am. Bit early,\" I say.</p> <p>\"Not if you didn't have dinner last night!\" he guffaws, picking at the pieces.</p> <p>Ashdown is a youthful 72, and has packed so much into those years \u2013 marine officer, spy, failed heavy-goods-vehicle driver, youth worker, leader of the Lib Dems, lord, governor of Bosnia, author. His new book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781845137014\" title=\"\">A Brilliant Little Operation</a>, is subtitled: The Cockleshell Heroes and the Most Courageous Raid of WW2. I ask what attracted him to the story of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Boat_Service\" title=\"\">Special Boat Service</a> mission to blow up the German merchant fleet anchored at Bordeaux harbour in December 1942.</p> <p>\"Come on!\" he says incredulously. \"What d'you think?\" He has a point.</p> <p>The story of <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/cockleshell_heroes_of_1942.htm\" title=\"\">Blondie Hasler and his 11 fellow raiders</a> couldn't be more apt for Ashdown to tell. Twelve men set off in six tiny canoes to destroy the huge ships. The project was as stupid as it was audacious; as tragic as it was triumphant. Yes, Blondie and a few of his men eventually paddled to their targets and planted limpet mines on the ships, but it turned out the ships were empty (the whole point was to stop them transporting cargo), the men were betrayed by a senseless secrecy at the highest level, and nearly all of them died; drowned or executed. And yet, pyrrhic victory though it appears, the mission demoralised the Germans, pricking their bubble of invincibility.</p> <p>Ashdown himself was an SBS officer, and the more you read of this moving story, the more you see how closely he relates to Blondie, the leader of the Cockleshell Heroes. In 1965, as a young man who had just qualified as a swimmer canoeist in the Royal Marines SBS, he met Hasler on a train but didn't recognise him. In the book, Ashdown describes how Hasler quizzed him, but he gave him short shrift. \"'Look, I'm not at liberty to tell you the details of my job. It's confidential and not to be discussed with those not entitled to know,' I replied in a pompous and irritable tone.\"</p> <p>When he was told it was Hasler he had been so rude to, he felt ashamed. And that shame has stayed with him ever since. After all, he says, Hasler's mission was a defining moment in SBS history. \"It was probably <em>the</em> event that showed Special Forces were not just going on shore, slitting a couple of German sentries' throats and coming out again.\"</p> <p>Ah, throat-slitting. Classic Paddy territory. Ashdown is a little bit in love with his own mythology as the Lib Dems' very own James Bond. At the same time, he's rather coy, or discreet, about his previous \u2013 while he's happy to hint at dark and dangerous undertakings, he suggests that it would be improper to go into details. The inside sleeve to A Brilliant Little Operation describes him as \"The only Mandarin-speaking trained killer to rise to prominence in British politics\".</p> <p>\"So by the time you joined the SBS its throat-slitting days were over,\" I say.</p> <p>\"Hahaha! Hahahahaha!\" He laughs loud and theatrically. \"You are so predictable, you guys! ... Have you ever slit a throat? So predictable!\"</p> <p>\"Well, you always avoid the answer,\" I say.</p> <p>\"Yeah, you're right I avoid the answer. I'm not answering that question, so forget it.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396498974\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348242004907/Ashdown-with-John-Major-a-010.jpg\" alt=\"Ashdown with John Major and Tony Blair at the VE Day celebrations, 1995.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashdown with John Major and Tony Blair at the VE Day celebrations, 1995. Photograph: Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Actually, he is far more interesting when he dampens down Action Man Ashdown. \"I was trying to make the point about Hasler that he never slit anybody's throat. He never killed anybody. He didn't like violence, and I didn't either. After a little war I fought in Borneo \u2013 God knows it was nothing in comparision to what these guys did \u2013 I wanted to conduct my soldiering more through guile than through violence. So it's actually not about slitting throats, that's the whole point of it.\" Ashdown points out that the SBS's motto used to be \"Not by strength, but by guile\" and regrets it has become: \"By strength and by guile.\"</p> <p>The previous day I had mistakenly turned up at his house, 24 hours early for the interview. Ashdown wasn't at home, but his wife Jane was. She's a lovely, warm woman, who speaks the language of the barrack room. I suggest that Paddy and Blondie had plenty in common. \"Oh no, he wouldn't assume ... Blondie was an absolute hero,\" she said. Then she thought about it. \"Awkward bastards,\" she said. \"Both awkward bastards.\"</p> <p>I mention it to Ashdown and he throws his head back and laughs so much I think he's going to choke. \"Me, an awkward bastard? Listen, I'm a quiet little herbivore. Aren't all Liberals nice, cuddly, herbivorous creatures on the border of politics? Hahahaha! You're such a shit; you go and interview my wife and use it against me.\"</p> <p>But he concedes that they did have plenty in common. \"He was an outsider, I was too. He was regarded by his friends as a bit unclubbable, and always testing the limits of his endurance, and I was. And the extraordinary thing is that this chap went through the same thing; he voted Liberal all his life and was always trying to find the alternative way of life.\"</p> <p>Actually, in his marine days Ashdown was a socialist. \"Not a very popular thing to be as a serving officer in the 1950s. When I commanded my first troop I discovered there were people who couldn't read and write, and I was scandalised. I thought: how could you have a nation that does that? I was a Labour party supporter till 1969.\"</p> <p>So what changed him? \"The thing that made me a liberal was in the SBS I was commanding men who were better men than I was. And I was in the position of being an officer because I had had a privileged background and had gone to a public school.\"</p> <p>In what way were they better? \"Better soldiers, braver, tougher. I would have relied on them anywhere. So the revelation to me serving in the SBS was that if you could only have a country that was genuinely meritocratic, in which every person was judged by their ability, that would be the kind of country I would want to be part of. So here I believe is the difference between a socialist and a liberal. A socialist believes everybody is equal in terms of outcome, or should be. I believe everybody deserves to be treated as equal in terms of their status as a human being, but the outcomes they produce are totally different.\"</p> <p>After leaving Labour in 1969 he found himself in the political wilderness \u2013 sceptical of all party politics. And then he heard a rat-a-tat-tat on the door. \"This is a bizarre story. It was 1974 and I'm off out to Geneva to the Foreign Office \u2026 or some strange part of it.\" Ashdown likes to allude to his time as a spy without saying the word. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/mar/19/profiles.parliament\" title=\"\">Don't you mean MI6</a>, I say.</p> <p>He affects a disapproving tone. \"Well, you can say what you like about it. I was a diplomat in Geneva. Anyway, I was on my way out to this posting, and a more unlikely angel of conversion you could not imagine. A bloke knocks on my door and I can't remember if he had sandals on, but he certainly had a cagoule on.\" He impersonates an insipid Liberal stereotype. \"'Hello, I'm from the local Liberals.' I said go away, and he said: 'Well, I'm canvassing for the election.' So I said: 'OK, come in, talk to me and if you can persuade me to be a Liberal I'll vote for you.' From that moment on I took liberalism down from the peg that it seemed to have been hanging on as an overcoat all those previous years and it's felt totally comfortable ever since.\"</p> <p>He left Geneva in 1976 to stand for the Liberals in his home constituency of Yeovil. It seemed a hopeless task. \"The Tories had been in power in Yeovil since 1910, and my leader [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/jan/28/liberaldemocrats.uk1\" title=\"\">Jeremy Thorpe] was then being arraigned for conspiracy to murder at the Old Bailey</a>.\"</p> <p>It took him eight years to win Yeovil, during which time he was unemployed for 18 months. \"We were down to our last 100 quid, and I said to Jane: 'What should we do?' And we said: 'Let's send the kids for a holiday to some friends in Switzerland.'\"</p> <p>Did he wonder why he'd given up the well-paid job in Geneva? \"Of course, yes. It was a mad decision.\" And it was a job he had enjoyed? \"Loved it. There's no job I've had that I haven't enjoyed.\"</p> <p>It was during this bleak time that he applied for a heavy-goods-vehicle driver's licence. \"I went off to do the aptitude test and the bloke said: 'Do me a favour, never drive a heavy lorry; you're absolutely lethal on the road.' But there wasn't anything I didn't try.\" Perhaps it is this struggle that has shaped him even more than the clandestine glitz of the marines and MI6 \u2013 and explains his ability to communicate to all sorts. In A Brilliant Little Operation, Ashdown writes that Blondie Hasler had no money for much of his life. Isn't that something else they have in common? He balks at the suggestion.</p> <p>\"Well, that's not true. That's not true, no, no, no. I've always been desperate about money. Not to get lots, but to have enough.\"</p> <p>He says his fear of poverty goes back to his father, a former officer in the Indian army who returned to Northern Ireland to run a pig farm. \"Remember, I'm the oldest of seven children, my father's business went bust in Northern Ireland, he emigrated to Australia with my six brothers and sisters.\" He stops to correct himself. \"Five brothers and sisters because one had died, and I was left behind. I watched the man I admired most in the world broken by the fact that he didn't have money. I'm obsessive about making sure my family has enough money. Blondie didn't care about money, he didn't bother to make money, but for me making sure my family has security matters a lot.\"</p> <p>In 1988, only five years after winning his seat, Ashdown was elected leader of the newly merged Liberal Democrat party. He was just what the party needed \u2013 tough, direct, a natural headboy. Does he think he could have been prime minister as leader of the Lib Dems? \"I'm pretty pissed off I haven't been.\" Again, he throws his head back and roars.</p> <p>\"But you mean it, don't you,\" I say.</p> <p>\"It spoils my whole afternoon that I haven't been prime minister. Hahahahahhaha!\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396498975\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348242120457/With-wife-Jane-at-the-tim-010.jpg\" alt=\"With wife Jane at the time of the Paddy Pantsdown scandal, 1992.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With wife Jane at the time of the Paddy Pantsdown scandal, 1992.

If you are leader of a party, what d'you want to do? You want to be prime minister. Course you do.\"</p> <p>In 1992, he admitted to a past affair with his secretary and the Sun reported it under the headline: <a href=\"http://sunheadlines.blogspot.co.uk/2008/12/classics-its-paddy-pantsdown.html\" title=\"\">It's Paddy Pantsdown</a>. Did that put an end to your ambitions to be PM? He bristles. \"No.\" It didn't make any difference? \"No, it improved my poll rating.\" Really? \"Yes, of course it did.\" He smiles. \"By the way, don't imagine I recommend it as a way of improving your poll rating.\"</p> <p>So Paddy Pantsdown was good for you? And now he is wholly serious \u2013 there isn't a hint of bluster or braggadocio, just a very raw vulnerability. \"It was terrible for me. <em>Terrible</em> for me. You have no idea. It was terrible for almost every aspect of my life. I thought the party was seriously damaged and it wasn't, but that was a tiny glimmer of light in what was an irretrievably bad period.\"</p> <p>Was he a victim of a fantastic headline? He shakes his head. \"Well, if you put yourself in a position where you can be done that kind of damage by a Sun headline, you're a fool. Aren't you? So don't blame the Sun, blame me.\"</p> <p>It would have done for many politicians, but Ashdown rode the storm, and remained leader for another seven years. He became high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002, and was widely praised for his healing stint in the brutalised country. After that there was another shift in Afghanistan at the request of Gordon Brown. Ashdown says he didn't want to go, but when you are asked to perform a public service, what do you do?</p> <p>A few weeks ago <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/liberal-democrats-must-back-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">he launched a leonine defence of the Lib Dems</a>, and more specifically leader Nick Clegg. Today, he does the same. He regards those <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/30/lib-dems-nick-clegg-peer\" title=\"\">who feel betrayed</a> by the party as weak or naive \u2013 notably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/apr/30/the-liberal-moment-has-come\" title=\"\">Guardian leader writers who backed them in 2010</a>. \"The Guardian feels like a jilted lover. It hates the Liberal Democrats. The Guardian feels personally betrayed because for the very first time it gave the Liberal Democrats its support and what did we do? We went off with the Tories. But what else would you have done in the circumstances?\"</p> <p>What about the first-time voters who voted Lib Dem because of their promises on student tuition fees, and because they believed they were a radical alternative to the main parties? Again he says it comes back to the single question, which he spells out in one-word sentences. \"What. Would. You. Have. Done?\"</p> <p>Well, I say, many voters might say it was right for the Lib Dems to team up with the Tories but it was wrong for them to vote Lib Dem in the first place and won't do so again. \"But what is the point of being in politics if you are not able to influence the government of your country? And it is the eternal battle for any thinking politician \u2013 between principle on the one hand and what is practical in effecting the government of your time. I think at the next election the Liberal Democrats will get a much bigger dividend than most commentators think because we'll have seen this thing through and stuck with it.\"</p> <p>What if the polls prove correct, and the party does lose half its vote? \"Even if the party were terribly damaged at the next election, I would still think it was the right thing to do.\"</p> <p>Ashdown knows all about conflict resolution \u2013 there was his four years in Bosnia for starters. \"Sarajevo is one of the greatest cities in the world. I speak Bosnian, and there's a great Bosnian saying: 'It's easy to beat thorn bushes with other people's pricks.' I said to Nick it will make an excellent motto for the coalition.\"</p> <p>But for now Baron Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon insists he has other things to concentrate on \u2013 seeing his two children, both teachers, whom he calls his best friends; racing his grandchildren on the ski slopes; and writing more books. Which all sounds perfectly feasible. But there were rumours that when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/oct/14/liam-fox-resigns\" title=\"\">Liam Fox resigned</a> as defence secretary he was hoping for a call. His face scrunches into a grin.</p> <p>\"Was I saying: 'My God, I hope a call comes! I cant wait! I'm so disappointed!'? <em>No!</em> Can I repeat the phrase that I have not the slightest hankering of going back into government.\" But if the coalition did come knocking? \"I'm very happy as I am.\" He stops, and silently weighs things up. \"But if the government asks me to do things, I'm very happy to do them.\"</p>",
  "<p>I wasn't really around in the 90s (I was a small child, not a convict). But as I understand it, United Colors of Benetton is a clothes brand that caused considerable outrage for a series of adverts where <a href=\"http://www.photoguides.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/black-and-white-baby-together.jpeg\" title=\"\">black babies played with white babies</a> (everyone was racist in the 90s), then went a bit quiet after American Apparel stole its jumpers-in-different-colours thunder.</p> <p>This week, Benetton tried to drum up a new knitwear controversy with an ad campaign that celebrates the number of unemployed young people in the world reaching 100 million. In the ads, sullen-faced young businesspeople clad in lambswool blazers and merino facial hair stare dejectedly into the middle distance like Apprentice contestants trying to think of a name for their pop-up courgette stall. They all stand under the tagline <a href=\"http://unhate.benetton.com/unemployee-of-the-year/index1/index/en\" title=\"\">\"Unemployee of the Year\"</a>.</p> <p>As part of the campaign, Benetton wants unemployed youngsters to pitch it ideas for community projects in return for a slice of a \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3400,000) fund. It says the aim is to motivate young people \"to become actors of change against indifference and stigma\". Yeah, bog off indifference.</p> <p>Benetton isn't the only one trying to get lazy teenagers motivated. In the past month alone, Boris has proposed putting them to work unpaid for three months, Gove has announced plans to make their exams harder and Cameron, by failing to ringfence funds for school breakfast clubs, wants to send them to school hungry.</p> <p>These ideas resonate because they tap into something parents already know. Teenagers are lazy. When mum and dad see Ariella and Felix, unable to sit upright until 10pm when a cloud of CK One and vodka breath arrives at their front door to whisk them away, they despair. But teenagers don't need to be motivated or even sober to control society. What Benetton, the government and parents don't understand is that even when they're splayed on the sofa watching Geordie Shore, teenagers can run circles round their parents, take over an industry, even ravage a country.</p> <p>This column is a warning. Your children are outsmarting you.</p> <p>While you're trying to Google what that song from the Paralympics coverage is, they've become Gambaccinious in their knowledge of music through a mastery of piracy and aggregation. They find it easier to buy alcohol and drugs than you do to use the Ocado iPhone app. They even dress better than you. Teenage boys, some as young as 14, understand layering. They sure as hell wouldn't be seen dead in Benetton.</p> <p>It might seem like this was always the case, but it wasn't that long ago that schoolchildren rarely explored further than the bench on the corner. In drool-stained metal hoodies and embroidered Miss Sixty jeans, they existed in a clannish, insular world where their loftiest ambition might be forming a band to play a resentful cover of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2AJc1IORc\" title=\"\">the Coral's Dreaming of You</a> in the school concert.</p> <p>Now they produce, publish and remix, often to global recognition. In the past month, music producers <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/disclosuremusic\" title=\"\">Disclosure</a>, two brothers aged 16 and 19, have signed a deal with Universal, <a href=\"http://www.thestylerookie.com/\" title=\"\">Tavi Gevinson</a>, a 16-year-old magazine editor, published her first anthology, The Rookie Yearbook, and Joe Bish, the 19-year-old blogger behind music site <a href=\"http://www.abeano.com/\" title=\"\">Abeano</a>, reviewed new singles on Radio 1. It's now legitimate for one 16-year-old to ask another: \"What do you do?\"</p> <p>What they can achieve individually is impressive, but what they can do together can have devastating effects. The riots, we can all agree, were a bad thing. But let's imagine for a moment that you had a sudden urge to smash up a Dorothy Perkins and nick a lifetime's supply of cardies. How would you go about it? Try and post something on Facebook to find other chilly kleptomaniacs? They would catch you in a second. Send a group text? But Margaret's got aqua-Zumba on Wednesday and Clint's not back from the Dordogne for another two weeks. Your crime spree would become an organisational nightmare.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/07/bbm-rioters-communication-method-choice\" title=\"\">BBM broadcasts</a>, the technology used to communicate rioting tactics, are immediate, can reach a large number of people without the need for response and are relatively untraceable. It's an ingenious way of committing mass crime. Intuitively, and on little more than a whim, young people brought the country to its knees.</p> <p>The riots were a one-off, but every weekend thousands of young people turn up to the house of someone they don't know, in hope of a party. Teenagers are hardly au fait with the strategic literature on popular organisation \u2013 that would take far too much effort \u2013 but they can mass mobilise in moments.</p> <p>They don't have to use their powers for destruction though. Youth's ability to deploy themselves is often used for political ends. Schoolchildren made up a huge part of the three biggest protest movements of recent times: against the war in Iraq, against global poverty during Britain's year hosting the G8, and most recently against education cuts. In those protests, teenagers used the mobile app <a href=\"http://sukey.org/\" title=\"\">Sukey</a> to evade getting kettled.</p> <p>The Benetton campaign comes with a clever viral video to represent this young world where hedonism and politics feel like the same thing. A steely American voice reads out a list of impressive worker attributes \"commitment\", \"perseverance\", \"going beyond the call of duty\" \u2013 over images of hipsters in job centres, art galleries and at protests. Unemployee of the year, get it? Being industrious at not having a job.</p> <p>Except Benetton don't get it. Teenagers aren't trying to be diligent or work harder, they're trying to do the bare minimum with maximum impact. And every time the young go up against the flaccid laws and blundering adults who try to persuade them otherwise, they win.</p> <p>The government, too, increasingly realises that the greatest threat to political stability is not unemployment itself, but a generation of hyper-mobilised young people with nothing to do. Is it any wonder they're trying to take away their Cheerios?</p>",
  "<p>On a day plucked from winter, with a bitter wind whipping up raw emotions under a dull grey sky, Liverpool showed further signs of promise under Brendan Rodgers but finished the match with nothing but a place in the bottom three.</p> <p>They are now looking at a statistic which shows that, since the start of 2012, they have won only two of their 12 league games at Anfield. Of a possible 72 points in the same period, home and away, they have taken a mere 20. By way of contrast, Sunday's visitors have amassed 56 points in the same period, from an identical number of fixtures.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the penalty with which Robin van Persie completed the scoreline, Manchester United's fans directed a chant of \"You're getting sacked in the morning\" at the Liverpool manager. The response from the Kop was instant. \"There's only one Brendan Rodgers,\" they sang. Pride was involved, of course, but perhaps they do indeed see their present plight as the darkness before the dawn.</p> <p>Rodgers certainly does. \"The better side lost today,\" he said. \"In the areas we could control, I thought we were outstanding.\" He disputed the pivotal sending-off of Jonjo Shelvey late in the first half and, less persuasively, the defeat-sealing penalty awarded against Glen Johnson for chasing back and tripping Antonio Valencia. \"Very soon our luck will change, we'll do what we need to do to win matches, and we'll fly.\"</p> <p>While Liverpool had a full complement of players on the pitch there were plenty of indications that Rodgers is getting them to play the way he wants, combining the Anfield club's traditional power game with his preferred short-passing style.</p> <p>\"We've got a group of young players here who can take the club forward,\" he said afterwards, having seen Raheem Sterling produce another encouraging performance, this time under the eye of Roy Hodgson, who made the teenager a late addition to his last England squad.</p> <p>Rodgers had also given a league debut to Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez, known as Suso, who came on for the limping Fabio Borini at half-time, and within a minute the 18-year-old Spanish forward skipped away from Paul Scholes, playing in the neat cross from which Johnson created the chance for Gerrard to give Liverpool the lead.</p> <p>Gerrard's response to the goal was to point to the sky, his thoughts no doubt on his late cousin, Jon-Paul Gilhooley, who died in the Hillsborough disaster, aged 10. As a moment of deep emotion, it compared to the one witnessed at Stamford Bridge four years ago when Frank Lampard steeled himself to convert a crucial Champions League penalty \u2013 against Liverpool, as it happens \u2013 in the week of his mother's death.</p> <p>The impeccable buildup to this highly charged occasion had featured a joint television interview by Rodgers and Sir Alex Ferguson, the presentation of a bouquet of red roses from Sir Bobby Charlton to Ian Rush, a handshake between Luis Su\u00e1rez and Patrice Evra, and the sight of the two captains, Gerrard and Ryan Giggs, releasing 96 balloons in commemoration of the Hillsborough victims. While the home fans sang You'll Never Walk Alone with a special intensity, United's fans responded with their own war cries, a gesture that teetered on the brink of unacceptability.</p> <p>Once the match got under way, ears were cocked for the sound of old hatreds. After a subdued and disjointed opening, however, most of the harshness was reserved for events on the pitch, where the weight of the collisions and the stridency of the appeals gradually rose throughout the first half until, in the 39th minute, Mark Halsey made the decision that shaped the match.</p> <p>Liverpool had worked hard to conquer their nerves and establish an definite ascendancy over a curiously disjointed United when Shelvey muscled Giggs out of possession and chased the loose ball into a second challenge with Jonny Evans. As the players slid towards each other, neither of them in full control of his action, Halsey's angle of vision persuaded him that Shelvey's part in the collision deserved a straight dismissal.</p> <p>Replays suggested that a yellow card apiece might have been a more sensible conclusion, but Halsey could only go on what he believed he had seen. It was a shame for the contest, for Liverpool, and particularly for the 20-year-old Shelvey, who left the pitch in a storm of rancour. His game has much more to it than his obvious athleticism and his appetite for the ball in the Liverpool midfield seems to take a little of the pressure off Gerrard, allowing the captain to distribute the ball in a more relaxed manner.</p> <p>What Liverpool really need, however, is for Su\u00e1rez to rediscover the goalscoring instinct that brought him 81 league goals in 110 appearances for Ajax and 28 in 54 matches with Uruguay.</p> <p>As committed to Sunday's contest as any player on view, he showed the potential to link effectively with Borini and Sterling, although he had only one decent chance to show for it, when Anders Lindegaard dived to push away his low left-foot shot on the hour.</p> <p>But his endless complaining tries the patience of officials. As we saw, referees are only human, and Halsey denied him what looked like a reasonable claim for a late penalty. It is a lesson Su\u00e1rez needs to learn if he is to play his part in a Liverpool revival.</p>",
  "<p>It was a good game to lose but preferably not by such a monumental margin as 90 runs. England, in pursuit of 171, were hapless and clueless against the Indian spinners and were bowled out for their lowest-ever T20 total. Between them Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla, currently the second string of Indian spinners, took six wickets for 25 runs from eight overs. It was not very pleasing for Stuart Broad and his side, though afterwards the England captain could remind us \"we are still on the bus to Kandy\".</p> <p>Everyone had been so impressed by England's campaign up until now but their old frailties against Asian spin resurfaced with a vengeance. They batted so badly that a certain pundit in the Cricket Extra studio must have found it difficult to say anything polite about batsmen who were trying to do his job in the England middle order.</p> <p>The other sides in the tournament would also have been looking on and making notes, the gist of which must have been: \"How many spinners have we got in our squad? Let's play them all against England.\" Harbhajan duped callow batsmen, mostly through subtle changes of pace. Chawla's leg-breaks were indecipherable from his googlies. England were startled rabbits in the floodlights.</p> <p>The rot set in when Irfan Pathan swung the new ball into the right-handed batsmen. Alex Hales swung and missed in the manner of a No11 \u2013 in fact Steven Finn would have been embarrassed by such a stroke. Luke Wright was lbw attempting to pull. Only Craig Kieswetter could middle the ball \u2013 provided the pace bowlers were operating.</p> <p>Eoin Morgan, who has not been at his most fluent out here, was confounded by Harbhajan's quicker ball. So was Jos Buttler. Jonny Bairstow slogged and missed in the manner of Hales. Tim Bresnan recalled the old notion that Yorkshiremen are a tad uncomfortable against wrist-spin. It was ugly in the extreme. In the space of a dozen overs England had cunningly and emphatically restored their role as underdogs in this tournament.</p> <p>The magnitude of this result will cause a few shudders. However, in the cold light of day (which does not exist over here) this thrashing does not matter too much provided the management can get the batsmen back on an even keel before England's next match against West Indies (or, in their dream world, Ireland) on Thursday.</p> <p>West Indies may pluck out Samuel Badree, a little-known wrist spinner, to accompany Sunil Narine for the game at Pallekele. The Kiwis will undoubtedly unleash Daniel Vettori and Nathan McCullum, who are, at least, conventional spinners.</p> <p>Meanwhile there is work to do for Graham Gooch and Andy Flower, not so much in a technical overhaul but in the restoration of confidence.</p> <p>Before Broad's tour took a little jolt downwards he opted to bowl first. The Indians somehow seemed more adept against the pace of Finn than the Afghans had been in England's first game. Finn was briefly back to his old ways. Soon his right knee clattered into the stumps, whereupon he ended up in an undignified heap on the pitch after delivering the ball.</p> <p>Finn did remove Pathan's off-stump with a full, fast, straight ball. However there was never any danger of Virat Kohli missing any straight balls. He is the new darling of Indian cricket but he has earned that status with a long sequence of glittering innings in one-day games. There were plenty of adoring supporters who had made their way to Colombo. For a moment it was as if Sachin Tendulkar was making his way to the crease.</p> <p>Kohli began with exquisite drives through the offside, classical strokes that would never be out of place in a Test match. Currently he looks as if he has oceans of time, even in a T20 game. He did not play an ugly stroke. Only Graeme Swann, Broad's most effective bowler, could check Kohli and he eventually removed him. For once Kohli was deceived and he drove an off-break straight into the hands of Bairstow at deep midwicket. England could have done with another skilful spinner on Sunday night \u2013 but this was the time to experiment.</p> <p>Fortunately for England Gautam Gambhir could not bat quite so fluently. There was a Machiavellian case for keeping him in but in the 16th over a fairly cunning slower ball from Finn found the outside edge and Gambhir departed.</p> <p>On his departure India accelerated via Rohit Sharma, who cracked 55 from 33 balls. From their last four overs they amassed 51 to leave England with a target of 171. There was another gem in the field in the final over by Buttler. He caught a skier from MS Dhoni at deep midwicket and managed to lob the ball in the air as his impetus began to take him over the boundary. Hales was on hand to complete the catch \u2013 routine brilliance from Buttler.</p> <p>England had replaced Samit Patel with Bresnan, presumably for two reasons. The Indians have always been deft players of spin and Bresnan is in need of a bit of rehabilitation. The Yorkshireman was a regular in Paul Collingwood's winning side in the Caribbean two years ago but currently faces a challenge from Jade Dernbach. But the chances of England maintaining a four-man pace attack throughout the tournament must be slim. They will juggle again in Pallekele. But they do not have so many options in their batting line-up.</p>",
  "<p>There's always been a slight air of fantasy about&#xa0;Brighton, from the&#xa0;fantasy architecture of its famous pavilion, to&#xa0;the fantasies of all those who move there hoping for a new start, a new life. So it's particularly appropriate that the Liberal Democrats are having their conference by its pebbled beach and stuccoed terraces: this is, indisputably, a fantasy conference.</p> <p>What is the conference motto? \"Fairer tax in tough times\" is emblazoned on every pass issued, and it flaps on rain-streaked banners. It's a good motto. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/29/lib-dems-french-style-tax-wealthy-assets\" title=\"\">Some kind of wealth tax</a> is the right&#xa0;issue to pick up, when people on&#xa0;welfare and the lower paid are being&#xa0;coshed. Reviewing the ludicrous extravagance of a Trident nuclear deterrent is,&#xa0;likewise, an excellent idea.&#xa0;Fighting for stronger environmental policies \u2013 investing in alternative energy,&#xa0;building greener infrastructure \u2013&#xa0;is, too, a noble cause.</p> <p>There's just one tiny little problem, guys. You are in government as part of&#xa0;a&#xa0;strongly rightwing Conservative-led regime. Nick Clegg may have bravely asserted on Sunday that he was going to&#xa0;persuade David Cameron and George Osborne to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19690327\" title=\"\">sign up to a wealth tax</a>, of some so far unspecified kind, but presumably a tax&#xa0;on property. Really?</p> <p>There are two possible responses. The first, that this is a thin, unconvincing attempt to fool his party and the public \u2013 a piece of conference-season posturing that will weaken him further, and pretty quickly. The second, that he believes it; that he's fooling himself. If so, he has left political reality so far behind that he has, at some fundamental level, lost it. Does he not talk to any Tory MPs or read the Conservative-supporting press? They are convinced the public have had enough of welfare spending rather than wanting to tax the rich.</p> <p>Cameron and Osborne are under pressure from their own right wing, and&#xa0;if they conceded a wealth tax they&#xa0;would have open revolt in the&#xa0;parliamentary party. A wealth tax or indeed a mansion tax would be much more substantial than the tax crackdown announced on Sunday, which is no more than trying to ensure that the law is obeyed. But it's a policy for a Labour government, or a Lab-Lib coalition, not for this one.</p> <p>That's why Ed Balls is studying it, and&#xa0;that's why other Lib Dems, including Vince Cable (who increasingly resembles a lugubrious hitman from some cold-war thriller \u2013 the Bulgarian in&#xa0;the fedora), are talking to Labour. However strongly Clegg suggests it, it isn't a policy he will ever be able to implement in this coalition.</p> <p>The same is patently true of rethinking Trident. Again, that's the kind of radical, progressive response to horribly tough economic times one would expect from a thinking centre-left party. And again, it ain't going to happen under Cameron and Co. It's a policy for&#xa0;some other government, as yet unelected, at some other time. Reviving a strong environmental agenda is in the same category. Great, but after the Osborne-led shift to a deregulatory strategy to boost building and businesses, it's not going to happen under this coalition.</p> <p>What's happening in Brighton is clear&#xa0;enough. The Lib Dems think of themselves as essentially a centre-left party, and are wallowing in the fantasy of presenting themselves as progressive politicians, ready to squeeze the rich and green the nation. The trouble is, in a&#xa0;few days' time, they make the short journey back north to Westminster \u2013 where they return to a centre-right government run by people who share none of these views.</p> <p>The Lib Dem fantasy is to concentrate on the one-day, might-be coalition with Labour they'd prefer, and policies they'd follow then. Who knows? It could happen. But meanwhile, by far the likeliest outcome of this posturing is that Clegg's new red lines on tax will simply mean minimal planning by the government on fiscal policy generally. He can stop Osborne making deeper welfare cuts \u2013 that's useful, and worth it \u2013 while Osborne can end his hopes of further taxes on the rich. It will be economic stalemate, very like the constitutional stalemate that followed the frustrating of Lords reform and boundary changes.</p> <p>So we will see, in the next two years, an even less confident and assertive government than we have experienced up to now. It will mean a drop in infrastructure spending, and probably an end to hopes of real, funded reform&#xa0;of the care system.</p> <p>The final part of this fantasy conference is the commonly held idea that Clegg isn't really the Lib Dem leader, or at any rate won't be for long. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/person/1667/tim-farron\" title=\"\">Tim Farron</a> is coming! Vince is on his way!</p> <p>But the plotting is real enough. A group of defeated MPs and others are planning a motion for the Lib Dem gathering next spring to change the party rules in order to allow leaders to be ousted by the party conference. They'd be unlikely to get the necessary two-thirds majority, but a simple numerical one would be such a stinging rejection of Clegg that he would have to resign. Then, the argument goes, the party could find a different leader (probably Cable, as a stopgap) for the 2015 election, and save as many seats as possible.</p> <p>Usually, we're told that conference plots are fantasies, and we should concentrate on the policies. Well, this time round, it's the other way about. The new policy positions are airy dreams, but the skullduggery is both real and becoming a more practical proposition with every opinion poll.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackieashley\" title=\"\"><em>@jackieashley</em></a></p>",

Even more bizarrely, he said the&#xa0;virus would order infected computers to play loud music in the middle of the night. \"I believe it was playing Thunderstruck by AC/DC,\" he observed, with appropriate detachment.</p> <p>To counter these multiple assaults, Iran has said it will take its computers offline, instead building an intranet that will function in Iran alone and not communicate with the outside world. This will represent a major step in the fragmentation of the internet into a series of giant intranets, each subject to the specific regulations of individual nation states. The move reduces Iran's risk of being infected by new viruses, though it will not eliminate it completely. But it would also be a devastating blow to ordinary Iranians, Iranian commerce and Iranian academics who keep abreast of global research through the net.</p> <p>Some countries, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have already introduced extensive content control and surveillance of users. But the Iranian concept goes well beyond this. Taken to its conclusion, it would mean users could only access material from Iran that, presumably, had been approved by the authorities. \"We have concerns from not only a human rights perspective, but about the integrity of the internet,\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-preparing-internal-version-of-internet/2012/09/19/79458194-01c3-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_story.html\" title=\"\">David Baer, from the US state department, told the Washington Post</a> this week. \"When countries section off parts of the web, not only do their citizens suffer, everyone does.\"</p> <p>However, the problem for the state department is that Iran is doing this because of attacks instigated primarily by Washington under its so-called Olympic Games programme. The US and Israel have embraced cyber-espionage with an eagerness that is being emulated by countries around the globe. What goes around comes around: on Friday, <a href=\"http://http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html\" title=\"\">US Senator Joe Lieberman claimed that Iran had launched disruptive attacks against a number of US banks</a>.</p> <p>An unregulated cyber-arms race in which states develop malicious code before deploying it across the world has been triggered. Recently the BKA, Germany's equivalent of the FBI, advertised openly for coders to write Trojan viruses for use in criminal investigations. \"Governments, intelligence agencies and militaries are all doing this. Two years ago this would have been unacceptable,\" noted Hypponen, \"but now everybody is at it.\" Two months ago the situation had become sufficiently grave to lure <a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/25/mi5-uk-terrorism-threat-warning\" title=\"\">Jonathan Evans, the head of MI5</a>, out of his traditional obscurity. \"The extent of what's going on is astonishing with industrial scale processes involving many thousands of people\" he said, pointing out that one British company had lost a staggering \u00a3800m as a consequence of a recent hack.</p> <p>There is no framework for restricting the use of cyber-espionage tools or weaponry. Each government now argues that they have no option but to join the race or lose. And with no prospect of agreement between the US, China and Russia, the three most influential internet powers (and, indeed, cyber-weapons developers), the web is moving into choppy, unchartered waters.</p>",
  "<p>Portugal's government is preparing a U-turn on an announced rise in social security contributions that would have instantly increased workers' payments by nearly two-thirds amid a growing popular revolt against austerity measures.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people took to town squares across the country a week ago to protest at the announced rise, which raised contributions from 11 to 18% of salaries, sparking a pledge by the government this weekend to reconsider the unpopular move.</p> <p>The centre-right prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, had solemnly announced the measure to shocked Portuguese workers, who would have lost the equivalent of almost a month's salary, during a televised speech a fortnight ago.</p> <p>\"The financial emergency that the country sank into in 2011 is still not over,\" he said at the time. \"We have begun to attack the problems we face but have not yet dominated them.\"</p> <p>But an eight-hour meeting of the presidential state council was besieged by protesters in the small hours of Saturday morning and ended with a government pledge to renegotiate deficit-cutting measures with trade unions and employers.</p> <p>\"The council was informed of the government's readiness to study, within the framework of the social bargaining process, alternatives to changes in the social security rate,\" a statement said after the council meeting. The council is presided over by the president, Anibal Cavaco Silva, and Passos Coelho is one of its members.</p> <p>Half a dozen protesters who were arrested outside the presidential palace on Friday night are due to appear in court on Monday. Demonstrators had demanded the government's resignation and chanted: \"Thieves, thieves!\"</p> <p>The mounting anger in Portugal about the austerity imposed by the bailout came as France appeared ready to offer concessions to Greece, the first country to need help from eurozone partners. The French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, told the news website Mediapart: \"The answer must not be a Greek exit from the eurozone.</p> <p>\"We can already offer it more time \u2026 on the condition that Greece is sincere in its commitment to reform, especially fiscal reform,\" he said.</p> <p>Aid to Greece from the IMF and European bodies is reliant on the cash-strapped country meeting tough austerity measures. Last week there were reports \u2013 later denied \u2013 that the latest inspection by the troika could be delayed until after the US presidential elections in November.</p> <p>The Portugese rethink marked a turning point in the country's patience with austerity, which was imposed on it after it asked for a \u20ac78bn bailout from the troika of the European Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year.</p> <p>Portuguese voters appeared to accept austerity measures as inevitable at the time and in June 2011 they elected a coalition of Passos Coelho's centre-right Social Democratic party and more right-wing People's party to carry them through.</p> <p>The country is now in its worst recession since the 1970s and the economy is expected to shrink by more than 3% this year. Recession is expected to continue in 2013, further reducing Portugal's chances of shaking off troika control.</p> <p>Passos Coelho had his knuckles rapped by the state council, which called for \"political and social dialogue to seek consensus\" rather than the unilateral imposition of measures in its Saturday morning statement.</p> <p>The council also asked the government, which had accompanied the rise in individual social security payments with a cut in those made by employers, to share the burden of austerity more evenly. \"Any solutions should \u2026 guarantee an equitable and just distribution of sacrifices as well as protecting those families with the lowest income,\" it said.</p> <p>Both the council and the government recognised, nevertheless, that Portugal must meet its obligations to the troika \u2013 which means finding another way to raise \u20ac6bn a year.</p> <p>Earlier this month the troika agreed to relax Portugal's deficit targets for the next two years but the government believes fresh measures are still needed to meet the new targets.</p> <p>Portugal's trade unions will bring their own deficit-cutting proposals to the table. They include a tax on financial transactions, higher business taxes, a harder line on tax fraud and higher taxes on dividend payments to large shareholders. A 0.25% tax on financial transactions would raise \u20ac2bn, according to the General Workers Confederation of Portugal.</p> <p>Passos Coelho's government will propose a new cut in holiday subsidies for workers, the Expresso weekend newspaper reported</p>",
  "<p>Having survived more than 40 years at the coalface of British journalism (longer than a term of service in the ancient Roman army), I have been feeling a bit depressed lately by the insistent predictions of media pundits that the internet is killing off quality newspapers. There are very few people in the trade who are prepared to bet that all our daily papers will still be publishing newsprint copies in five years' time.</p> <p>According to conventional wisdom, print is doomed. Circulations are collapsing because readers can get everything they want on the internet. Not only do those readers dislike the idea of paying to read online, but the existence, among other sites, of the rival licence-fee-payer-funded BBC website guarantees that they will never actually need to pay for a supply of reliable day-to-day news. Paywalls will never really work in a UK context for that reason.</p> <p>Yet when the day comes that the newspapers are forced to stop printing altogether, it will be a disaster for democracy. The lean pickings from web advertising on a free newspaper site will only pay for a fraction of the high-quality investigative journalism that commercial newspapers generate. We'll just get the timid BBC on the one hand, and superficial junk on the other.</p> <p>In this glum frame of mind, I read the latest National Readership Survey figures. To my surprise, what leaped out from them was that there is now in existence a perfectly easy way to rescue newspapers, ensure media plurality, and monetise the web.</p> <p>I realise the search for such a wondrous thing by beleaguered print editors has long been like the unachievable quest for the holy grail. But, arithmetically speaking at least, the British solution is obvious. Consumers won't pay for online news. But they are of course paying, now and for the foreseeable future, and in huge numbers, for the necessary broadband connections.</p> <p>A small levy on UK broadband providers \u2013 no more than \u00a32 a month on each subscriber's bill \u2013 could be distributed to news providers in proportion to their UK online readership. This would solve the financial problems of quality newspapers, whose readers are not disappearing, but simply migrating online.</p> <p>There are almost 20m UK households that are paying upwards of \u00a315 a month for a good broadband connection, plus another 5m mobile internet subscriptions. People willingly pay this money to a handful of telecommunications companies, but pay nothing for the news content they receive as a result, whose continued survival is generally agreed to be a fundamental plank of democracy.</p> <p>A \u00a32 levy on top \u2013 collected easily from the small number of UK service providers (BT, Virgin, Sky, TalkTalk etc) who would add it on to consumers' bills \u2013 would raise more than \u00a3500m annually. It could be collected by a freestanding agency, on the lines of the BBC licence fee, and redistributed automatically to \"news providers\" according to their share of UK online readership.</p> <p>On the most recent figures, this system would provide transformative chunks of money to the most popular news websites.</p> <p>The Telegraph group, the Associated Newspapers' stable and the Guardian Media Group would each receive in the region of 20% of the cash \u2013 \u00a3100m a year. Even the Independent papers would pick up around \u00a340m a year. Other titles, such as the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, could see a potentially life-supporting transfusion of \u00a38m and \u00a34m respectively.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch's Sun would collect an annual \u00a350m, although his other papers, if they stayed behind a paywall, would receive relatively little.</p> <p>There would be no insuperable problems in defining \"news providers\". The starting point would be to designate those organisations already classed by the state as zero-rated newspapers under the 1994 VAT legislation : \"Newspapers \u2026 issued at least once a week in a continuous series under the same title \u2026 [which] contain information about current events of local, national or international interest. Publications which do not contain a substantial amount of news are not newspapers.\"</p> <p>Other original news providers could subsequently apply to the independent levy board for admission to the scheme, case-by-case. But there would have to be a reasonable size threshold for admission, perhaps set at 100,000 monthly users, and also some rules to exclude content aggregators. The BBC website would not get any extra cash from the levy, as it is already financed by the British taxpayer.</p> <p>Is this solution too politically fraught? The first party to adopt such a levy scheme will certainly get my future vote. The levy would, like the BBC, be operationally ring-fenced against \"state intervention\", although it might well be subject to the same long-term political tensions as the BBC licence fee.</p> <p>That licence fee system still works more or less successfully, of course, just as the more extreme Nordic model of direct newspaper subsidy does. And perhaps we don't need to worry too much about the long term. For in the long term, all the newspapers might otherwise be dead.</p>",
  "<p>Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas' frenzied celebration when Jermain Defoe plundered what proved to be the winning goal told its own story. It was from the realms of Stuart Pearce at Euro 96 and the elation could only have been magnified as his Tottenham Hotspur team had been so dismal in the opening 45 minutes.</p> <p>Jeered off at half-time, it had been easy to fear the worst for the Portuguese. But a half-time reshuffle helped to turn the tide and two quick goals were sufficient to earn the manager a first home victory at the fourth attempt, Defoe's fourth of the season at club level coming hard on the heels of Ale Faurl\u00edn's own goal.</p> <p>Queens Park Rangers will kick themselves all the way back to west London. They had led at the interval through the former Tottenham centre-forward Bobby Zamora's fourth of the season and their supremacy was total. Brad Friedel kept the home team in contention with three fine saves. But the second-half turnaround was remarkable and it allowed Rangers to lament the continuation of their terrible away form.</p> <p>The relief for Villas-Boas was palpable. While his opposite number Mark Hughes reached for the heavy-duty overcoat as the rain lashed down, he seemed oblivious as his smart suit came to resemble a sponge. At full-time he clenched his fist and gave vent to another wild outpouring. It has been far from smooth sailing but, after the win over Reading and now this, he has something on which to build.</p> <p>\"It's important that people understand we have wanted this home win for quite some time,\" Villas-Boas said, mindful that no Tottenham manager has ever failed to win one of his first four home games. \"You could feel the anxiety when we went 1-0 down and we can be a bit more stable now. Everybody felt emotional at the end.\"</p> <p>It was edgy. Tottenham created nothing in the first-half and their lack of cohesion was startling. Friedel was the hero as he marked his 309th consecutive Premier League start with eye-catching saves, tipping over Clint Hill's header and twice denying Junior Hoilett. Hugo Lloris, the \u00a313m goalkeeping signing from Lyon, is set to remain as a substitute. \"The situation will carry on,\" Villas-Boas said. \"We are paying respect to a player who is performing very well.\"</p> <p>Faurl\u00edn and Esteban Granero called the midfield tune in the first half and it was no surprise when Rangers took the lead. It did not work out for Zamora during his six-month spell at White Hart Lane in 2003-04 \u2013 he scored only once, in the League Cup \u2013 but his finish here bristled with assurance, after he had been released by Faurl\u00edn's beautifully disguised through ball.</p> <p>Villas-Boas admitted that he had erred in the first-half by inviting Rangers to take the initiative in the hope that Tottenham could counter, and he had to change at half-time. He shuffled his side to push Gareth Bale further forward on the left, while he moved Clint Dempsey up with Defoe and asked his defenders to hold a higher line. Bale had started at left-back as Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto and Kyle Naughton were injured, but it is no good having your best attacking player in defence. Jan Vertonghen moved across from centre-half.</p> <p>Everything was soon turned on its head. Steven Caulker, the half-time substitute who replaced Vertonghen in central defence, rose to meet a Bale corner and Faurl\u00edn, so impressive in the first half, found himself facing the wrong way and, under pressure from Defoe, bundled into his own net.</p> <p>Tottenham were in front as Rangers reeled. Vertonghen led a fast break, with the QPR manager complaining about what he said were fouls on Granero and Nedum Onuoha. \"We are very disappointed with the referee,\" Hughes said. Vertonghen slipped the ball to Bale, whose shot clipped J\u00falio C\u00e9sar and reared against the bar but Defoe was lurking. He took a touch and scored from close range.</p> <p>Caulker made a difference on attacking set-pieces while Dempsey also came into the game, threatening with his shooting from distance. Bale marauded and he and Defoe might have added to the lead. The points, though, meant everything.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Brad Friedel (Tottenham Hotspur)</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>Parade's End's success may have been bittersweet for Piers Wenger, the former BBC executive who worked closely with Sir Tom Stoppard to bring Ford Madox Ford's novels to the screen. By the time the acclaimed period drama aired on BBC2, Wenger had switched sides to Channel 4, where he is four months into his new role as head of drama.</p> <p>\"That was the show that in many ways was the hardest to leave,\" says Wenger. \"I left about halfway through the shoot. I thought it was wonderful.\" Wenger will have to watch from another table at awards time if the adaptation cleans up, as expected. \"I thought Benedict [Cumberbatch] and Rebecca [Hall] really worked in those roles. They found romantic comedy in a very unlikely place.\"</p> <p>Now Wenger has his own parade to boast about, a trio of new dramas including New World, a sequel to the well-received civil war drama The Devil's Whore, written by Peter Flannery and Martine Brant. Home Before Dark, written by Abi Morgan (The Hour, The Iron Lady) with Kevin Macdonald as executive producer, is a four-part thriller spanning the UK, Italy and the US that examines the corrupting power of the internet. Another new commission, Dates, is a series of half-hour dramas by the Skins creator, Bryan Elsley, looking at modern relationships.</p> <p>Apart from the award-winning pair of Ronan Bennett's Top Boy and Shane Meadows's This Is England '88, homegrown C4 drama has been relatively quiet of late, Wenger acknowledges. \"There has been a pause but by the time the next few months are through it won't feel quite the same,\" he says .</p> <p>His predecessor, Camilla Campbell, quit in December to set up her own production company, one of a string of executives to leave the broadcaster last year. \"It wasn't like the shop was shut up \u2013 shows were commissioned after Camilla left and before I arrived,\" Wenger points out. \"But since I've come into the post we have commissioned a lot of new stuff and next year will feel very rich and diverse.\"</p> <p>But it is telling that the shows that come up in a discussion of the channel's recent hits, The Devil's Whore and David Peace adaptation Red Riding, were shown in 2008 and 2009 respectively. \"They have that double helix of delivering great reputation for the channel but also being able to deliver the numbers,\" says Wenger. \"That is the thing we are looking to do with the shows we commission.\"</p> <p>Wenger joined C4 in 2011 at its big screen arm, Film 4, and will continue to oversee the projects he started there, including the keenly awaited Paul Raymond biopic King of Clubs, starring Steve Coogan. Previously head of drama at BBC Wales, Wenger executive-produced two series of Doctor Who and was responsible, along with its showrunner Steven Moffat, for the Doctor's latest incarnation in the shape of Matt Smith.</p> <p>Moffat describes Wenger as \"incredibly brilliant and sharp\", and a very effective manager of creative talent. \"He makes you feel clever all the time when it's actually probably him,\" says Moffat. \"You go out with a flattering sense of your own brilliance when in fact what you are doing is what he wanted you to do in the first place.\"</p> <p>Wenger lists Doctor Who and his two collaborations with Victoria Wood, Housewife, 49 (which Wood also wrote) and the Morecambe and Wise biopic Eric and Ernie, both of which won Baftas, as the shows of which he is most proud. He was also responsible for the misfiring Upstairs Downstairs comeback.</p> <p>He met Wood after writing her a fan letter while he was still at ITV, where he began as a trainee script editor in 2000 working on the ill-fated soap Night and Day. \"To my great amazement she replied,\" he remembers.</p> <p>\"I was a massive fan to an almost embarrassing degree. I could quote big swaths of her sketch shows,\" adds Wenger, who hopes the pair will collaborate again. \"She understands characters' emotions and lives in a way that no one else does. She has a very thin skin which allows her to absorb and have insights into other people's emotional lives that audiences find a ring of truth around.\" Wenger began his career as a journalist on Just 17, but in his late 20s he took nine months out of journalism after his father was paralysed in a serious car accident. \"I found myself watching lots of television drama and the depths and intellectual challenge of working in drama started to appeal.\"</p> <p>He found out about his latest job when C4's chief creative officer, Jay Hunt, telephoned him in Los Angeles where he was celebrating his 40th birthday. She told him to talk to Tessa Ross, C4's controller of film and drama, when he returned, and he drove straight to Ross's house from the airport.</p> <p>Wenger wants the next year of drama output on C4 to be a \"shop window\" for the range of work that writers and directors can expect to do on the channel. It will also include The Fear, starring Peter Mullan as a crime boss suffering from dementia, Dennis Kelly's cult conspiracy thriller Utopia, and Tony Grisoni's Southcliffe, about a fictional English market town devastated by a shooting spree.</p> <p>\"I want the buzzwords for next year to be scale and range,\" Wenger says. \"I wanted to send a very clear message to the world that this is the place where you don't have to feel hidebound by a very defined commissioning brief.</p> <p>\"There is a huge amount of drama which is of a certain type, the trick to get audiences to come to them afresh is to find new ways into those stories, new perspectives on these subject matters and the only way to do that is to empower the authors.\"</p> <p>C4's hit US series Homeland, a Showtime adaptation of the Israeli drama Hatufim, returns for its second season next month. Wenger says the channel can take inspiration from the show, which finished its first run with an overnight audience of nearly 3 million.</p> <p>\"We don't want to be a minority choice. I've always worked on really mainstream shows, whether it's Doctor Who or my work with Victoria Wood. My instincts are to try and reach as big an audience as possible,\" he says. \"If you look at the success of Homeland, or even the Paralympics, Channel 4 is a place where you can take a big idea and shape it in a unique way.\"</p> <p>Like Homeland, Abi Morgan's thriller Home Before Dark will be given a 9pm slot. \"We are going to attack 9 o'clock hard. We absolutely want to compete on as big a stage as possible.\"</p> <p>Paul Abbott's Shameless has been a ratings banker since 2004. But after 115 episodes and in the middle of series 10 (an 11th is already in the pipeline), how long can it and Frank Gallagher last? \"It's like every series, we look at how they perform when they go out, and how the creative team feel about how much more they have to say,\" says Wenger.</p> <p>More serious questions have been asked of Hollyoaks, as this year Hunt said the 17-year-old tea-time soap was \"not on its best form\". \"It had a tough summer but like any soap its ratings can go up and down,\" says Wenger. Is it on notice? \"Absolutely not. The sense was we needed to look at it and make it stronger, and we've done that.\" Its producer, Bryan Kirkwood, credited with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/may/27/hollyoaks-new-producer\" title=\"\">reviving the show between 2006 and 2009</a>, has returned after a stint on EastEnders, and last week it had around 1 million viewers, a 5%-6% share. \"It has to reflect the audience's life in an entertaining and authentic way,\" says Wenger.</p> <p>As he looks for C4's next big hit, thoughts turn back to Parade's End. \"Even though it was quite a lengthy and exhausting process getting that show financed and co-produced and cast, I am really glad that it has found an audience and that what was there in the novels has resonated with people thanks to Tom,\" says Wenger.</p> <p>\"There are [other] literary properties that feel as difficult and as brilliant as those novels did that we are going after, because I think that's the best of what television can offer people.\"</p>",

Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team left it late, Laurent Koscielny lashing the ball past Joe Hart after 82 minutes, but they deserved their equaliser and can be encouraged by the way they matched and frustrated the champions.</p> <p>City rarely played with the style and control that has established the Etihad as the most formidable territory in the Premier League, with no home defeat for approaching two years. Joleon Lescott's headed goal, from a corner five minutes before half-time, was out of keeping with what had preceded it and an unsatisfactory day was epitomised by those moments in the second half when, first, Sergio Ag\u00fcero played a simple pass to an opponent and then David Silva rolled the ball straight out of play for a throw-in. It was rare to see revered players suffering this form of carelessness and, coupled with the fact City have not managed a clean sheet this season, Roberto Mancini was justified afterwards in complaining that there must be an improvement.</p> <p>Wenger's team always displayed a little more poise and, though they also endured periods when their football was not as clean and slick as their manager expects, there were spells when they threatened to wear their opponents down. Santi Cazorla was prominently involved, always wanting the ball and knowing the right thing to do with it. Mikel Arteta played with similar composure and Aaron Ramsey impressed in an unfamiliar wide role. When Jack Wilshere is back playing, this is going to be a delicious midfield.</p> <p>Their problem is an obvious one, namely how to make do in attack without Robin van Persie. Lukas Podolski was substituted after a peripheral performance while Gervinho is too erratic, his touch frequently poor. One superb pass from Ramsey sent him running clear, at 0-0, but the striker's clumsiness wasted the opportunity, knocking the ball too far ahead and allowing Hart to cut out the danger. Olivier Giroud may solve the problem when he finds some confidence but for now the Frenchman is only on the edges, restricted to 18 minutes as a substitute.</p> <p>Mancini admitted that Arsenal had dominated in midfield during the first half, compelling him to take off Scott Sinclair at the interval and bring on another of his new players, Jack Rodwell. Sinclair, starting his first home match for City, had been poor and replacing him with a more central player did have an effect on the game early in the second half. City, nonetheless, lacked their usual drive, with Carlos Tevez not in the starting line-up and the fit-again Ag\u00fcero trying to renew a partnership with Edin Dzeko that has never really existed, almost a year to the day since their last start together.</p> <p>Ag\u00fcero worked hard but looked rusty and flashed wide a late chance. The little incident at the end, when Mario Balotelli said something to Mancini and the manager pushed him down the tunnel, compounded a bad day for City and, though these are still early days, there is a legitimate feeling they have temporarily lost some of the impetus that took them to the title. Afterwards, Wenger said a draw was the least his team had deserved.</p> <p>Arsenal had taken their time to get going in the second half but their goal came from a spell of mounting pressure. Hart had tipped Cazorla's drive over the crossbar and when the Spaniard swung in the corner Lescott could not get enough leverage on his header. Koscielny's first touch controlled the ball, the second was a shot that was still rising when it went into the top corner.</p> <p>Koscielny was guilty, for Ag\u00fcero's chance, of giving the ball straight to his opponent inside the penalty area. The early-season improvement in Arsenal's defending was not particularly obvious, too, for Lescott's goal, originating from a Silva corner that the otherwise impressive Kieran Gibbs need not have conceded. Vito Mannone, deputising for the injured Wojciech Szczesny, came off his line but never got close to claiming the ball. Lescott had Podolski and Koscielny in close proximity but still managed to head the ball inside the far post.</p> <p>It was a soft goal to concede but overall Arsenal restricted their opponents to few clear chances, despite Thomas Vermaelen's illness forcing Wenger to change his back four for the first time this season. Tevez and Balotelli could not bring a new spark to City's attack when they came off the bench, while Silva struggled to find his touch and Sinclair remained quiet with his new club. At least he is getting a game: this was the third successive match James Milner, an England regular, has not even made the bench.</p> <p>Theo Walcott will have his own frustrations after being omitted in favour of Ramsey, a central midfielder asked to play on the right wing. Arsenal's system, however, was neat and effective. City, with 76 points out of a possible 78 in their home games before this fixture, have still not really got going.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Santi Cazorla (Arsenal)</p>",

A woman in the audience told him crisply that the problem wasn't the issue: the Lib Dems were the party that didn't break its promises, \"and when we got into power, the first thing we did was break a promise!\"</p> <p>That was worth another apology. \"I apologise; it's my responsibility to apologise \u2026 but I firmly believe we did the right thing to go into coalition.\"</p> <p>At this there was a stirring in the hall, and a few of the zombies recalled what it was like to have blood circulating in their veins at 98 degrees, or a little less. They sort of applauded, or some did.</p> <p>\"If we had retreated to our normal position of throwing rocks at the government, I don't think the British people would ever have taken us seriously again.\" Somewhat less applause at this; many of the audience look back on their rock-throwing days with nostalgia.</p> <p>He was clearly nervous. He kept repeating himself. \"I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not \u2026\" he chuffed like the Little Engine That Could. But then they were on to the environment and he was happier there.</p> <p>And he was growing in confidence. Rather a free society with a raucous press, he said, than an unfree society with a tame and insipid press. Even that got a few claps from those who could recall that their hands were to be found on the end of their arms.</p> <p>But they actually woke up at the end when he talked \u2013 shouted \u2013 about the coalition's economic policy. \"What on earth do you call \u00a340bn for infrastructure, \u00a310bn for housing, \u00a380bn released by Mervyn King? We have pried the clammy hands of the Treasury off these projects!\"</p> <p>He sketched out the horrors of being like Spain, Greece or Italy: \"not nice\" for a nation to lose control of its destiny. \"We had to pull the country back from the brink where Brown and Balls had left it!\"</p> <p>And it was his wedding anniversary! Twelve wonderful years. That was worth a light sprinkling of applause, which is just what it got, before they resumed their moribund silence.</p>",
  "<p>Soldiers! Soldiers!\u201d The man hissed his warning as he hurried past, two bullets from a government sniper kicking up dust from the dirt road behind him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/syria-civil-war-five-years-guardian-reporting\">Syria's civil war: five years of Guardian reporting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was enough for Abu Omar al-Chechen. His ragtag band of foreign fighters, known as \u201cmuhajiroun brothers\u201d, was huddled in the doorway of a burned-out apartment building in the university district of Aleppo. One of the brothers \u2013 a Turk \u2013 lay dead in the road around the corner and a second brother lay next to him, badly wounded and unable to move. They had been unable to rescue him because of the sniper.</p> <p>Abu Omar gave an order in Arabic, which was translated into a babble of different languages \u2013 Chechen, Tajik, Turkish, French, Saudi dialect, Urdu \u2013 and the men retreated in orderly single file, picking their way between piles of smouldering rubbish and twisted plastic bottles toward a house behind the front line where other fighters had gathered.</p> <p>Their Syrian handler stood alone in the street clutching two radios: one blared in Chechen and the other in Arabic. Two men volunteered to stay and try to fetch the young injured man.</p> <p>The fighters sat outside the house in the shade of the trees, clutching their guns and discussing the war. Among them was a thin Saudi, dressed in a dirty black T-shirt and a prayer cap, who conversed in perfect English with a Turk sitting next to him. He had arrived the week before and was curious about how the jihad was being reported abroad.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do the foreign news organisations and the outside world say about us?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo they know about the fighting in Aleppo? Do they know that we are here?\u201d</p> <p>Hundreds of international fighters have flocked to Syria to join the war against Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government. Some are fresh-faced idealists driven by a romantic notion of revolution or a hatred for the Assads. Others are jihadi veterans of Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan.</p> <p>To reach the wars in those countries, foreign fighters had to cross borders with forged passports and dodge secret services. The frontline in Syria is easier to reach via a comfortable flight to southern Turkey and a hike across the border.</p> <p>According to the Saudi, it was an easy walk from Turkey to the small Syrian town of Atmeh. There, in a hilly landscape flecked with olive groves, the recruits were received by a Syrian who runs a jihadi camp and organised into fighting units. Each team was assigned an Arabic speaker and given 10 days\u2019 basic training, the point of which was not to learn how to shoot but to learn to communicate and work together.</p> <p>The fighters were then dispersed among the different jihadi organisations, including Ahrar al-Sham (\u201cthe Free Men of Syria\u201d) and Jabhat al-Nusra (\u201cthe Front for the Aid of the People of the Levant\u201d). Some, like Abu Omar\u2019s Chechens, were allowed to form their own units and simply referred to as the muhajiroun, or \u201cimmigrants\u201d. The Syrians refer to the internationals collectively as the \u201cTurkish brothers\u201d.</p> <p>The disparate levels of fighting ability among the men was immediately clear. The Chechens were older, taller, stronger and wore hiking boots and combat trousers. They carried their weapons with confidence and distanced themselves from the rest, moving around in a tight-knit unit-within-a-unit. One of the Turks was a former soldier who wore western-style webbing and equipment, while the three Tajiks and the Pakistani were evidently poor. Their trousers were too short, their shoes old and torn.</p> <p>The men were also secretive, especially when dealing with the Free Syria Army. When the Syrians asked them where they were from, a blond French-speaker said they were Moroccans, the Chechens said they were Turks and the Tajiks said they were Afghans. On the steps of a commandeered school, behind a flimsy barricade of corrugated sheets and a barrel, a group of Libyans sat complaining about the lack of ammunition. They had arrived the previous day and already lost one of their friends to a Syrian army machine gun. \u201cThis is a poor revolution, very poor. We are in the second year [of it] and they still don\u2019t have enough weapons and ammunition,\u201d one of the Libyans complained.</p> <p>Inside the school was a Jordanian who often roamed the frontline with his Belgian gun, for which he had only 11 bullets. He was a secular and clean-shaven former officer in the Jordanian army who lived in eastern Europe running an import-export business. He had come to Aleppo without telling his wife and children where he was going.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is my duty,\u201d he said. \u201cOriginally I was from Palestine. I know what this [Syrian] regime did to the Palestinians, shelling the camps in Lebanon, assassinating the commanders. Half of the miseries of our nation are because of Israel and the other half are because of the Syrian regime.</p> <p>\u201cMany Arab men I know want to come and fight. Some lack the means and others the energy, but so many people hate this regime. For 20 years the regime has destroyed the Arab world.\u201d</p> <p>If some of the foreign fighters in Aleppo were callow, others such as Abu Salam al Faluji boasted extraordinary experience. Abu Salam, a rugged Iraqi with a black keffiyeh wrapped around his head, said he had fought the Americans in Falluja when he was a young man. Later he joined al-Qaida in Iraq and spent many years fighting in different cities before moving to Syria to evade arrest. These days he was a commander of the one of the muhajiroun units.</p> <p>I found him watching a heated debate between the Syrian commanders about how to defend the buckling frontline.</p> <p>The government attack had begun as predicted and mortars were exploding in the streets nearby, the sound of machine-gun fire ricocheting between the buildings. The mortars were hammering hard against the walls, sending a small shower of shrapnel and cascading glass, but Abu Salam stood unflinching.One Syrian, breathing hard, said that he had fired three times at the tank and the RPG didn\u2019t go off.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it didn\u2019t go off,\u201d Abu Salam admonished him. \u201cSay you don\u2019t know how to fire it. We used to shoot these same RPGs at the Americans and destroy Abrams tanks. What\u2019s a T72 to an Abrams?</p> <p>\u201cOur work has to focus on IEDs and snipers,\u201d he told the gathering. \u201cAll these roofs need fighters on top and IEDs on the ground. You hunt them in the alleyways and then use machine-guns and RPGs around corners.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is not ammunition, it\u2019s experience,\u201d he told me out of earshot of the rebels. \u201cIf we were fighting Americans we would all have been killed by now. They would have killed us with their drone without even needing to send a tank.</p> <p>\u201cThe rebels are brave but they don\u2019t even know the difference between a Kalashnikov bullet and a sniper bullet. That weakens the morale of the men.</p> <p>\u201cThey have no leadership and no experience,\u201d he said. \u201cBrave people attack, but the men in the lines behind them withdraw, leaving them exposed. It is chaos. This morning the Turkish brothers fought all night and at dawn they went to sleep leaving a line of Syrians behind to protect them. When they woke up the Syrians had left and the army snipers had moved in. Now it\u2019s too late. The army has entered the streets and will overrun us.\u201d</p> <p>He seemed nonchalant about the prospect of defeat.</p> <p>\u201cIt is obvious the Syrian army is winning this battle, but we don\u2019t tell [the rebels] this. We don\u2019t want to destroy their morale. We say we should hold here for as long as Allah will give us strength and maybe he will make one of these foreign powers come to help Syrians.\u201d</p> <p>The irony was not lost on Abu Salam how the jihadis and the Americans \u2013 bitter enemies of the past decade \u2013 had found themselves fighting on the same side again.</p> <p><strong>Advance</strong></p> <p>Abu Omar, the Chechen commander, issued an order for his men to advance to try to retake their lost positions around the University of Science.</p> <p>The Syrian soldiers had stopped their advance and withdrawn their tank, leaving only the snipers. A car was riddled with bullets and still on fire, a skeleton of a bus lay few metres away smouldering, and orange flames and black smoke was spewing from a the first floor of a building.</p> <p>But three of Abu Omar\u2019s men were pinned down by snipers, and one had stood up to shoot the tank with an RPG and been riddled with bullets.</p> <p>Two Chechens were already in the middle of the square. They hid behind a short stone wall while bullets chipped on the wall\u2019s edge. Abu Omar conferred with a Syrian officer in heavily accented classical Arabic on how to rescue his men. A column of Syrians climbed over an apartment building and tried to shoot at the sniper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd0c789e4e6b5231a38ffe0963fc57bf0556691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd0c789e4e6b5231a38ffe0963fc57bf0556691/0_83_5212_3126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Free Syrian Army rebels shooting at government position and snipers in the Aleppo neighbourhood of Salahuldin in August 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Free Syrian Army rebels shooting at government position and snipers in the Aleppo neighbourhood of Salahuldin in August 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After an hour, the shooting had eased and the two men ran across the alleyway. They zigzagged and fell on the ground. One of them was thick-set, his grey T-shirt torn and covered by a patch of blood. A small metal piece of shrapnel was lodged in the left side of his chest. He pulled it with his fingers and held it for his friends to inspect. Then he smiled.</p> <p>In broken Arabic, the Chechen described how it had happened.</p> <p>\u201cFor one or two hours we were there, but the sniper shot at us too much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe moved to the left and the brother moved to the street. There the sniper shot him. There is no sadness, no fear, the brother is a martyr,\u201d he said, and quoted a verse from the Quran.</p> <p>But Abu Omar was angry. There had been 40 muhajiroun few days earlier but by the end of fighting that day they were down to 30. They had lost 10 men in two days.</p> <p>That night he issued an ultimatum to the Syrian rebel commanders. If they hadn\u2019t mustered a large number of men to support their rear the muhajiroun would pack up and leave.</p> <p>The reinforcements did not materialise, so the Chechens left in the night.</p> <p>\u201cLet them go,\u201d fumed a Syrian commander next day. \u201cI didn\u2019t hit them on their hands and tell them to come fight the jihad and take responsibility of this frontline.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bab al Hawa</strong></p> <p>At the border post of Bab al Hawa some days later, a confrontation was brewing between the jihadis and Syrian rebels.</p> <p>Fighters from the Farouq brigade \u2013 one of the best-equipped and most disciplined units in the FSA \u2013 were sleeping on the grass in the shadow of a big concrete arch. The fighters wore military uniforms and green T-shirts emblazoned with insignia of the brigade \u2013 an achievement in the disarray of the revolution. They had many tanks and armoured vehicles captured from the Syrian army parked around the border post, under cover.</p> <p>Nearby, a group of 20 jihadis had gathered in a circle around a burly Egyptian with a chest-long silver beard.</p> <p>\u201cYou are in confrontation with two apostate armies,\u201d the Egyptian told the men, referring to the Syrian army and Free Syrian Army. \u201cWhen you have finished with one army you will start with the next.\u201d</p> <p>The confrontation had started a few weeks ago, when the foreign jihadis, who played a major role in defeating government forces at the border post, raised the black flag of al-Qaida, emblazoned by the seal of the prophet, on the border post.</p> <p>The Farouq brigade demanded the flag be lowered lest it antagonise the Turks and threaten the rebels\u2019 vital supply route. One bearded fighter in the Farouq brigade, a salafi himself, said he had pleaded with jihadis, telling them that their presence would stop Nato from sending supplies. \u201cThey told me they were here to stop Nato,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The rebels gave them an ultimatum to evacuate, and the jihadis had taken up attack positions on the stony hills overlooking the post, surrounding the Farouq fighters. who in turn were threatening to use their armoured vehicles.</p> <p>I spoke to the regional commander of the Farouq brigade, a muscular young lieutenant from the southern province of Dara\u2019a called Abdulah Abu Zaid. \u201cI will not allow the spread of Takfiri [the act of accusing other Muslims of apostasy] ideology,\u201d he told me in his military compound a few kilometres from the border post. \u201cNot now, not later. The Islam we had during the regime was disfigured Islam and what they are bringing us is also disfigured. The Islam we need is a civil Islam and not the takfiri Islam.\u201d</p> <p>The jihadis, he said, had looted and stolen from the local people and demanded protection money from local businesses in order not to steal their merchandise. \u201cI managed to stop them,\u201d he said, \u201cand I won\u2019t let them spread here.\u201d</p> <p>Later that day he issued an ultimatum to their commander, a Syrian called Abu Mohamad al Abssi, to leave the area with his foreign jihadis or he would be killed.</p> <p>I met Abu Mohamad, a monosyllabic doctor, the next day. He emphasized that he had been struggling against the regime since 1992 while the Free Syria Army were defected officers who until recently served the regime. The Arab spring was, he said, a result of Islamic fervor.</p> <p>\u201cWe will never leave our positions here,\u201d he said in a quiet voice. \u201cGod-willing we will win.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later, Abu Mohamad\u2019s body was found in a ditch. He had been kidnapped and killed.</p>",
  "<p>Like Christmas, party conference season seems to come round quicker every year. In 2011 it was all about \"the economy, stupid\", but nasty anti-human rights stunts&#xa0;are always a convenient distraction. Remember last year's Tory \"catflap\", and assertions \u2013 discredited by&#xa0;the judiciary \u2013 that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/oct/04/reality-check-cat-theresa-may\" title=\"\">domestic pets prevent deportation</a>?</p> <p>Last year the Liberal Democrats, now meeting in Brighton, reaffirmed their commitment to the Human Rights Act. The Lib Dem rank and file has always valued fundamental rights and freedoms. All democrats should, of course, but during the authoritarian age of Tony Blair and Michael Howard, civil liberties became a core issue of identity and recognition \u2013 what Lib Dems were for. But the coalition's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/justice-and-security\" title=\"\">justice and security bill</a>, which will be debated at the conference on Tuesday, proposes grave violence to fair civil courts. Heavy on secrecy and light on justice, it would turn trials into covert committee meetings, locking the public, press and even claimants and their lawyers out of court wherever the government asserts \"national security\". It is \"reform\" of the most reactionary kind \u2013 overturning more than 400 years of civil justice and effectively putting the government above the law.</p> <p>In opposition, the Lib Dems took strong stands against rendition, torture and the spread of secrecy in the courts. Their pre-election manifesto opposed control orders because house arrest should not be imposed by way of secret&#xa0;evidence incapable of challenge. The argument levelled against this stance was the prospect of suspects walking the streets, but this time the law achieves neither detention nor deportation \u2013 only cover-up. It's hard to imagine Lib Dems swallowing this, and a principled motion tabled by lawyer Jo Shaw seeks to ensure they don't. However, the inevitable amendment drafted by government advisers, with subtle sleight of hand, would completely emasculate the motion and allow the Lib Dems to support a shameful, self-serving, spook-authored bill.</p> <p>Attempts to pretend this is actually about extending civil justice are Orwellian. The courts and press exposed some of the greatest scandals of the war on terror, and the securocrats decided to take their revenge. The government claims the bill will allow it to put more material before a judge, thereby increasing scrutiny. But evidence presented in private and not challenged by the other side is not evidence at all. It could easily mislead the judge and allow absolution of government abuses while everyone else is left in the dark.</p> <p>Current practice already allows sensitive material to be heard in court, and many complex trials and inquests proceed without difficulty. Despite insisting that reforms are necessary to allow future civil claims to proceed, ministers cannot point to a single past case that has been struck out because too much relevant material was protected. In truth, this bill would allow huge swaths of material currently put before the courts and the public to be suppressed.</p> <p>It is very sad to see Ken Clarke being used as cheerleader for these proposals. He has dismissed opponents as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/19/secret-courts-tony-blair-wars?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the&#xa0;more reactionary parts of the human rights lobby</a>\". Not an obvious label for a group that includes media across the&#xa0;political spectrum, the government-appointed \"special advocates\" on whom the system would rely, and the United Nations special rapporteur on torture. It's to be hoped that Liberal Democrat party members won't find themselves on the other side.</p> <p>The idea of rejecting or diluting tomorrow's important conference motion should be unthinkable. While debates about economic decisions taken&#xa0;in government must continue, it's no exaggeration to say that this bill would change the face of our civil justice&#xa0;system forever.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat party members have traditionally come together over democratic values of fairness, freedom and open justice \u2013 and are rightly proud of their reputation as champions of human rights. Is now really the time to&#xa0;apologise for those values, let alone to forget them?</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Afternoon.</strong> Again. I've just hopped over from the Liverpool v Manchester United minute-by-minute which was a typically quiet affair, so forgive the lack of an introduction. We'll keep it short and sweet and give you the teams. </p> <p><strong>Manchester City:</strong> Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Clichy; Silva, Garcia, Yaya Toure, Sinclair; Dzeko, Aguero <strong>Subs:</strong> Pantilimon, Kolarov, Nastasic, Barry, Rodwell, Tevez, Balotelli</p> <p><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Mannone; Jenkinson, Koscielny, Mertesacker, Gibbs; Diaby, Arteta, Ramsey; Cazorla, Gervinho, Podolski. <strong>Subs:</strong> Martinez, Djourou, Santos, Coquelin, Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Giroud.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Mike Dean.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Some top banter with Roberto Mancini and David Platt at the moment. They're sitting in an Italian cafe somewhere in Manchester with Geoff Shreeves. But... wait ... where's Brian Kidd? Why isn't Brian Kidd invited? Oh this is a bitter pill. \"What do you drink?\" asks Shreeves. \"British water,\" says Mancini. \"What's that?\" says Shreeves. \"Beer!\" parps Mancini. And up pop three Peronis. </p> <p>I'd like a Peroni.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>\"Disappointing to see City starting with four at the back today,\" says Ethan Dean-Richards.</strong> \"If the season after winning the league isn't about thinking of tactically innovative ways of losing it then what is it about? Winning it by more than goal difference? Don't think so.\" </p> <p>What's your tactical take on today's game, Ethan?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Ethan Dean-Richards offers his tactical view.</strong> \"Two at the back, three in the middle, four up front, one's gone home for his tea. Beans on toast? Possibly, don't quote me on that. Marvellous.\"</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Here come the teams.</strong> Hello teams! \"Mancini did say that his favourite dishes there are pizza and pasta,\" says SB Tang. \"Maybe Mr Kidd's on a gluten-free diet?\" Ah, like Novak Djokovic. He'll be off winning grand slams soon.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Both teams will wear black armbands to pay their respects to the two police offers who were murdered in Manchester this week.</strong> There's also a minute's applause for the pair.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Well, off we go.</strong> Arsenal, attacking from right to left, get us going. It's immediately hoofed out for a throw-in. Classic Arsenal.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> A confident, bright start from Arsenal. There's a spring in their step and they're passing the ball around very slickly indeed, easily bypassing City's midfield four. The move ends with Diaby losing the ball to Clichy on the right though. Still, it was pleasant to watch.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Both teams are feeling each other out at the moment - careful - but there's a lack of zip to proceedings so far. It's very <em>technical.</em></p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Ramsey skims a low cross into the area from the right but it's easy for The Hartdog to collect. \"Never mind Peroni - where's Vermaelen?\" asks John Cox. He's injured.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> A sprightly start from Arsenal, who have been the sharper side so far. They're quicker to the ball, although they're enjoying what Arsene Wenger terms sterile domination, possession for possession's sake.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Cazorla has an optimistic dig from distance but Hart plunges down low to his left to save comfortably. City are yet to get going. It's very flat inside the City of Manchester Stadium too.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> It's very tight but Arsenal are marginally on top. Gervinho dribbles into the area on the left and tries to beat Lescott, who expertly holds him up with a fine challenge. Arsenal stay on the attack though and Arteta dinks a ball over the top to Gibbs, marauding forward in the style of Marcelo on Tuesday night, but instead of taking the ball down and shooting he cushions a pass to no one.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Here's the first glimpse of Sergio Aguero. Arsenal allowed him far too much time to cut in from the left and hammer a shot goalwards that Mannone could only beat out. Zabaleta's cross was then awkwardly hooked behind by Koscielny for a corner, which came to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> What a risible piece of play from Gervinho. Arsenal broke on the counter and Ramsey slid a wonderful pass in behind Clichy, setting Gervinho through. He was clear on goal but with only Joe Hart to beat he clumped the ball around five yards in front of him with his big clown shoes, allowing Hart to smother. That was the worst period of football you will see all weekend.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Arsenal are really playing very well though. Podolski's canny flick sets Gibbs on a romp down the left but his cross is too high for those waiting in the middle. City counter with Sinclair down the left but his attempted through-ball to Aguero is cut out by Mertesacker.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Sinclair chips a pass over the top to the onrushing Silva but he can't turn the ball back to the unmarked Dzeko, who would have had a clear sight of goal. \"I've just realised,\" realises Matt Dony. \"Barring one large, fairly obvious difference, Gervinho and Foo Fighters tub-thumper Taylor Hawkins look awfully similar. They often play football similarly, too.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> \"Niall Quinn is pronouncing it 'Clich\u00e9',\" says Brian Kitt. Which is ironic because he is fluent in it.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Thirty yards from goal, Diaby takes his time and then decides he might as well have a shot. Lescott gets in the way. \"Pizza, pasta and Peroni?\" says Simon McMahon. \"You'd never guess Mancini was Italian, would you?\" Hang on, I'm not Italian and I had pizza and Peroni last night.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> If this was on Podolski's left foot, Arsenal might be in front. But it wasn't, so they're not. Arteta poked a pass out to the right for Jenkinson to chase but it looked like Lescott had the situation under control. However he allowed Jenkinson to nip round him and into the area, from where he cut the ball back to Podolski, who blasted into orbit with his right foot from 15 yards out.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> \"Is there any chance that Arsenal's \"meanest defence in the premier league\" has more to do with the sale of the defensively incompetent Song than it does with the promotion of Steve Bould?\" says Benedict Simmons.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Gibbs picks out Ramsey with a diagonal ball from left to right but Ramsey's downward header runs straight through to Hart.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> City aren't exactly hanging on here but Arsenal are having the better of this. The excellent Cazorla skitters towards the City area and then pokes an eye-of-the-needle pass behind Clichy and through to Gervinho. But just as he was about to pull the trigger, Clichy stepped in with a crucial challenge. Arsenal have been mightily impressive. By way of contrast, up the other end Sinclair runs the ball out of play for a throw-in under no pressure.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> City's experiment with a four-man midfield isn't working at all. Arsenal are outnumbering them in that department and breaking through it at will. They just have to be more decisive in the final third though.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Ramsey drives through the middle and is brought down by Kompany around 30 yards from goal. There are frowns on those City faces.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Cazorla hits a low free-kick through the wall but Hart is alert to the danger and saves down by the left post. He did quite well to hold there as it skipped up off the turf right in front of him. It also took a slight deflection on the way through.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> City can barely string two passes together. Yaya Toure's ball out to Clichy on the left goes out for a throw-in. Dearie me. They are in a rare old funk at the moment. Up the other end, Gervinho cuts in from the left and drags a low shot into the side-netting. \"YEAHHHHH!\" go the Arsenal fans. They thought it was in. It wasn't. The City fans jeer. Banter.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Scott Sinclair is out of his depth.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester City 1-0 Arsenal (Lescott, 40 min):</strong> There wasn't much evidence of that new-found defensive solidity here. After playing so poorly for much of the first half, City take the lead with the softest of goals. Arsenal conceded a needless corner, Gibbs not getting a shout to leave an aimless cross and headed it behind. Silva curled it to the far post and when Mannone came and got nowhere near the ball, there was no stopping Lescott's bullet header. On the touchline, Arsene Wenger slumps deep into his seat. They can't get you in the puffer jacket, Arsene.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Suddenly City are rampant and Dzeko goes close to doubling their lead with a stunning left-footed shot from 25 yards out. Mannone goes some way to redeeming himself for his error by tipping it over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Cazorla drops the shoulder and sees it open up for him, but he skews his shot well wide from the edge of the area. Arsenal's shooting and decision making in the final third has left a lot to be desired. \"Arsenal's \"sturdy\" defence shows the same weakness that has plagued the team since forever,\" says Shooby Taylor. \"The more things change, eh?\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Half time: Manchester City 1-0 Arsenal.</strong> The story of the half: Arsenal dominated, didn't take their chances and let in a moronic goal. Sounds familiar.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Off we go again. City have made a change at half time, Jack Rodwell coming on for Scott Sinclair and beefing up their midfield. That also means Toure is playing further up the pitch, which could spell trouble for Arsenal. Indeed he's on the charge straight away but his shot from distance is well wide. \"Just to say, far too much is being made of the Steve Bould solidity,\" says Emmo Opoti. \"The Southampton and Montpellier matches could've ended far differently.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> A corner to Arsenal. Koscielny heads it away. \"Maybe Arsenal watched Liverpool earlier and took offence at their brazen plagiarism of the Wenger blueprint,\" says Matt Dony. \"Arsenal are sure they can self-destruct with even more style. Wait for the comedy penalty conceded halfway through the second half...\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> City look more balanced with three in midfield. Dzeko wins a cheap free-kick off Arteta on the right flank. A chance to put more pressure on Vito Mannone.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Silva's inswinger is flicked to Aguero at the far post but he greedily shanks a volley over the bar. \"I know this day will come where we miss Van Persie (A clinical finisher/focal point) in the final third,\" says Baby Jayaraj. \"The intricate passing is not finding the right person to finish things off. Gervinho looks tired. Ramsey is the best player on the pitch for me and made the most incisive passes.\" Perhaps that striker on the bench can make himself a hero.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> The way pundits drone on about the evils of zonal marking, you'd think teams never ever conceded a goal from a corner when marking man-to-man.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Now it's City who are making all the running. When Arsenal lose the ball in midfield Silva nips in and races through the middle, before shuffling the ball to the right to Aguero. A goal beckons but he's put off his stride by Koscielny - he's after a penalty but stayed on his feet, as he did against QPR in May - and eventually is shot is deflected over.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Silva's corner is headed down into the ground and straight at Mannone by Javi Garcia. I blame zonal marking.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Arsenal need to change this because since the introduction of Jack Rodwell, City have dominated midfield. Credit to Mancini for rectifying his initial selection error. With the route through the middle now blocked, Arsenal could do with introducing Walcott or Oxlade-Chamberlain to trouble City out wide. It's too congested in the middle now.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> So impressive in the first half, Arsenal have been rubbish in the second. City have a grip on this now.</p> <!-- Block 42 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nyouEluT99E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nyouEluT99E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>62 min:</strong> City fans are singing their song about the Toures. Which reminds me.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Tottenham trailed QPR 1-0 at half time, Bobby Zamora with the goal. They now lead 2-1 after an own goal from Alejandro Faurlin and a strike from Jermain Defoe. \"Martin Tyler just mentioned 'greasy top',\" said Rizwan Qayyum. \"I was delighted that someone finally acknowledged Clichy's hair.\" He's here all week.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Arsenal have their first shot of the second half. Unfortunately Gervinho had it, so it's still 1-0 to City. He was set up by Cazorla but spanked it over the bar from an angle on the right.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Edin Dzeko is replaced by Carlos Tevez.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> When are Arsenal going to make a substitution? City are pipe and slippers comfortable.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong>At last. Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott replace Abou Diaby and Lukas Podolski. I'm not entirely sure how Gervinho has managed to stay on, but there you go.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Gervinho shimmies and prods a pass to Giroud, whose hooked effort from eight yards out is deflected wide for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Kompany heads the resulting corner. It's pumped straight back in by Arsenal and amazingly the flag stays down despite Mertesacker being a yard offside. He tries to nod it down for a team-mate but Hart is alert to the danger.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> I have to be honest. This game has largely been complete tosh.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Arsenal are so blunt. Their final pass has regularly been poor. In fact, their all-round passing game has gone to pot in the second half.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> This is not what Arsenal wanted to see: Yaya Toure striding through the middle, charging against a backtracking defence. He hangs on to the ball a bit too long though and when he does pass to Aguero, the angle is that bit tighter. He still forces Mannone to push the ball past his near post though. The corner is cleared.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> At long last, Joe Hart is called into action and he was more than up to the task. Cazorla let rip with a vicious shot from 25 yards out and Hart magnificently pushed it over the bar. Arsenal have a corner on the left. From which...</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester City 1-1 Arsenal (Koscielny, 82 min):</strong> There's the equaliser for Arsenal! There has been a lack of quality in the second half but perhaps they deserve this for refusing to give in. Cazorla's corner was inadvertently sent only as far as Koscielny by Lescott. Koscielny chested it down and before any City player could get to him, he crashed a shot into the top corner from 12 yards out. Yet again City have failed to keep a clean sheet.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Having got themselves back into the game, Arsenal almost shoot themselves in the foot immediately. From a City corner, Silva headed to Kompany whose overhead kick was pushed out wonderfully by Mannone - but Koscielny astonishingly gave the ball straight to Aguero in front of goal. It looked a certain goal but somehow he slashed wide of the right post from six yards out. What a miss.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Mario Balotelli replaces Sergio Aguero. \"Damn you zonal marking!\" says Shooby Taylor.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Koscielny has just cleared the ball with a backheel on the edge of his own area. Oh me, oh my.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> The Arsenal fans got excited when Gervinho made space on the edge of the area for the shot, sensing a famous last-minute winner. I'm not sure why. It was Gervinho. The ball ended up in the upper tier. For anyone else, that was a glorious chance.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>90 min+1:</strong> Gervinho is replaced by Francis Coquelin. Arsenal will take a point now.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90 min+2:</strong> Javi Garcia is booked for a cynical foul on Jenkinson, who was set to speed off unimpeded down the right. Is there a more improved player around than Carl Jenkinson?</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>Full time: Manchester City 1-1 Arsenal.</strong> Mike Dean brings an end to a strange game and Arsenal will be delighted with a point that demonstrates a resilience they have not always been associated with. It is, after all, a draw at the home of the champions. Champions who were mostly distinctly underwhelming for the most part. Arsenal might be slightly disappointed not to leave with all three points actually, having dominated the first half and conceded a sloppy goal. They kept plugging away though and got their reward. Thanks for reading. Bye.</p>",
  "<p>Recession-hit Spaniards will this week be told to swallow yet more austerity as the government prepares a fresh round of reforms and another budget filled with spending cuts and tax increases that will allow it to seek a bailout from eurozone partners.</p> <p>Pension freezes are also expected to form part of a raft measures to prepare the way for the European Central Bank (ECB) to give Spain support to control borrowing costs that will eat up a large chunk of next year's budget.</p> <p>The budget is to be announced on Thursday, alongside the reform programme. Neither seemed likely to contain measures to immediately ease Spain's chronic 25% unemployment, which some analysts expect will rise to 26.5% next year.</p> <p>On Friday Spaniards will learn just how big the hole in their banks really is, with an official report expected to say these must find an extra \u20ac60bn to cover damage wreaked by toxic real estate loans.</p> <p>The figure to be provided by consultancy Oliver Wyman, which will cover 14 banking groups that make up 90% of the sector, represents the maximum amount banks will have to ask for from the \u20ac100bn that the eurozone has already set aside to rescue Spanish banks.</p> <p>Small investors who bought risky hybrid shares in banks will have to shoulder part of the \u20ac60bn losses. Some banks may also be able to raise capital without going to the eurozone rescue fund, further reducing the amount to be provided by the fund.</p> <p>The Spanish finance minister, Luis de Guindos, confirmed over the weekend that Oliver Wyman was expected to produce a figure of around \u20ac60bn , though there were reports of last-minute tensions with Spanish authorities about exactly how to measure the banking hole.</p> <p>It remained unclear, however, when the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, would make the expected request for a bailout. The reforms and budget are meant to cover most of the conditions that the eurozone might impose, making the bailout easier to negotiate and less politically damaging to Rajoy's government \u2013 which has claimed it might still be able to avoid the bailout altogether.</p> <p>Rajoy's decision-making may be coloured by a looming constitutional crisis, as the Catalan parliament next week debates moves towards demanding greater sovereignty amid increasing rage in the north-eastern region over austerity measures and the way tax money is gathered and divided between Spain's 17 regional governments.</p> <p>The prime minister's rejection last week of the tax reform proposals of the Catalan regional leader, Artur Mas, may see the latter's national Convergence and Union coalition ally with openly separatist parties to demand a right to self-determination that is not currently part of the Spanish constitution.</p> <p>Mas is expected to call fresh regional elections before Christmas as Catalonia fights for a larger share of the shrinking Spanish tax pot and as Rajoy's government insists that all regions apply their own austerity measures.</p> <p>A vote on the self-determination proposals would come on Thursday, making the question of the future independence of Spain's wealthiest region a key part of any future election campaign.</p> <p>Juan Rosell, leader of Spain's employers federation and of its Catalan subsidiary, has called the issue \"a huge problem\" for Spain as it struggles to emerge from a double-dip recession that analysts predict will see the economy shrink by about 1.6% this year and in 2013.</p>",
  "<p>Four years ago, as they looked into the post-<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\" title=\"\">Lehman Brothers</a> abyss, our political leaders promised \"never again\". Both David Cameron and Vince Cable have called for a new \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/jan/19/david-cameron-responsible-capitalism-video\" title=\"\">responsible capitalism</a>\", where banks would invest for the long term. But behind the scenes the Treasury is sabotaging efforts to control one of the most extreme forms of casino capitalism \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading\" title=\"\">high-frequency trading</a>\". And that tells us a great deal about our ruling elite's real plans for Britain's economic future.</p> <p>The past fortnight has seen growing calls for curbs on HFT \u2013 the use of complex computer systems that spot market patterns, buy millions of shares and hold them for micro-seconds before selling them on. Last Thursday, a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/senate-panel-looks-into-high-frequency-stock-trades/2012/09/20/7d4b5b9c-0358-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story.html\" title=\"\">US Senate committee heard harsh criticisms of these technologies</a>, and the head of the Australian stock exchange denounced some practices as \"inherently dangerous\". Meanwhile, MEPs have announced plans to impose severe regulation. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/16/meps-ban-high-frequency-trading\" title=\"\">The Treasury, however, has been fighting to dilute any reform</a>, claiming that HFT makes markets more efficient.</p> <p>HFT generates huge profits for financiers and stock exchanges, but many blame it for market volatility and crashes. The most recent victim was the American firm, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/aug/06/knight-capital-computer-glitch-trading\" title=\"\">Knight Capital</a>, which almost collapsed last month when a computer malfunction cost it $440m. More serious was the \"flash crash\" of 2010, when these technologies briefly sent American shares plummeting and threatened market panic.</p> <p>HFT also reveals a deeper problem with the economy of the last few decades: finance's extreme short-termism, and the funnelling of resources into trading rather than investment and jobs.</p> <p>The coalition government claims to&#xa0;be&#xa0;worried about this, and commissioned the respected economist John&#xa0;Kay to investigate. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/jul/23/john-kay-city-short-termism\" title=\"\">His report, published in July</a>, was scathing about the City's myopic culture, and accused it&#xa0;of \"undermining\" support for \"innovative, sustainable long-term business performance\". But while the government made polite noises, it has&#xa0;shown few signs of listening.</p> <p>So why are our leaders so determined&#xa0;to ignore the lessons of 2008? Lobbying from finance is one factor. Some 16 of 31&#xa0;members of a \"high-level&#xa0;stakeholder group\" \u2013 one of the two panels advising the Treasury on the&#xa0;issue \u2013 have links to&#xa0;the HFT industry. But the problem is more deep-rooted. Most of our leaders cannot imagine what&#xa0;the British economy might look like&#xa0;without a free-wheeling financial sector. Lack of vision afflicts left as well&#xa0;as right: within the Labour party, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edballs\" title=\"\">Ed&#xa0;Balls</a> is opposing plans that might upset the City.</p> <p>Yet this is not to accuse politicians of bad faith. The choices facing Britain are not easy ones. Britain has had an unbalanced economy for decades, and changing direction will take more than a&#xa0;few policy initiatives.</p> <p>Ever since London challenged Amsterdam as the west's main trading hub in the 17th century, a \"merchant\"-style capitalism has dominated the centres of power. This encouraged a particular economic outlook \u2013 flexibility and market awareness, but also a preference for short-term profit over long-term domestic investment.</p> <p>London's economic elites were masters of global networks, but less interested in developing the home economy \u2013 hence the frequent tensions between finance and industry. Merchant&#xa0;dominance also helps explain why Britain \u2013 unlike Germany \u2013 has never enjoyed the collaboration between finance, technocratic industrialists and scientists and workers that is so essential for stable growth.</p> <p>This approach seemed plausible when global finance boomed after the 1980s. City profits and easy credit obscured the deep flaws beneath the surface. But with the collapse of that model in 2008, Britain has reached a turning point: it either \"resets\" its economy or it continues on the old course, and risks social crisis.</p> <p>Some Labour thinkers are pondering major change \u2013 this is what Ed Miliband's oddly named \"predistribution\" is all about. But the details remain vague.</p> <p>The Conservatives, on the other hand,&#xa0;seem doggedly determined to tread the merchant path \u2013 even if they rarely say so openly. For the Treasury hopes that just as the City remade itself in the 1950s and 1960s as a lightly regulated haven for American \"eurodollars\", so London's financiers can find a new role: as bankers to Beijing.</p> <p>Earlier this year George Osborne outlined this vision in a little-noticed speech. London would be the main western centre for trading the Chinese renminbi, and Britain would become a&#xa0;giant casino for Chinese plutocrats, with a little luxury (and defence) industry attached; the new Asian rich, he enthused, would buy \"Rolls-Royces made in Sussex, and Bentleys made in Crewe, dressed in Burberry clothes manufactured in Yorkshire\". This is hardly the inclusive, hi-tech, green economy that we need.</p> <p>It is clear, then, that the Treasury still&#xa0;sees finance as the crucial dynamo of the economy. And that is why it is fighting tooth and nail to stop City regulation. The consequences are deeply worrying. The strategy will generate high incomes for a few, not decent living standards for the many. London will become an ever more blingy&#xa0;city state with a southeastern hinterland, attached to an impoverished north and west. A disaffected Scotland may leave. We could also see more of last year's riots, so reminiscent of the urban unrest that afflicted the mercantile London of the 18th century.</p> <p>London cannot be both a merchant city state and the capital of a nation state. Our elites have to make a choice \u2013 they can either respond with split-second speed to the signals of the global markets. Or they can represent the interests of the population that they claim to serve. The British people will&#xa0;put up with a lot, but their&#xa0;patience&#xa0;is not infinite.</p>",
  "<p>We don't normally regard slipping into the background as an attribute, but 15-year-old Sam McTannan thinks being a wallflower is his greatest gift. He likes not being noticed, he enjoys escaping attention and is unsurprised when Violet Morgana, the girl of his dreams, still does not recognise him after three years of school together.</p> <p>As a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/superman\" title=\"\">Superman</a> obsessive, he treats this cloak of invisibility as a superpower and, in Johnny McKnight's teen-friendly play for <a href=\"http://seethrusam.com/\" title=\"\">Random Accomplice</a>, he is naturally distressed when his ability suddenly fades. The moment his parents die in a car crash (like many a comic-book adventure, this tale has tragic origins), he becomes the centre of attention. See-through no more, he is the boy noticed by everyone \u2013 from earnest home-economics teacher to fussing relative and jealous school bully. Losing his parents is bad enough, but this is an introverted teenager's worst nightmare.</p> <p>Persuasively played by James Young,&nbsp;Sam has not only the stumbling inarticulacy of your typical teenage boy, but a rich interior life defined by his love of superheroes and the memory of his parents. One of the strengths of the script, with its mix of direct audience address and regular dialogue, is its sensitivity to Sam's many faces: gawky adolescent, vivid fantasist, best mate, lover-in-waiting. When he mumbles incoherently in front of the teacher, the audience understand the complexity of what he would like to say.</p> <p>In his own production, McKnight offsets the serious themes with the multi-role-playing fun of Julie Brown and James Mackenzie (particularly terrifying as love-rival Chunk) and the&nbsp;running commentary of <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user1308551\" title=\"\">Jamie Macdonald's black-and-white animations</a>. Despite the playwright's way with a one-liner, however, the production is not as funny as you might expect, partly because the coming-of-age story is more&nbsp;familiar than subversive, but it&nbsp;does build to a touching and surprisingly tragic conclusion.</p>",
  "<p>Sicily. Family. Sexuality. These are the codes that the <a href=\"http://www.dolcegabbana.com/\" title=\"\">Dolce &amp; Gabbana</a> label is founded on. On Sunday in Milan, the designers once again celebrated their brand of Sicilian chic on the catwalk with a colourful and folksy collection that brought to mind warm summer days spent pottering around cobbled squares and dining at street cafes with printed tablecloths.</p> <p>Cactuses in pots stood at the end of the catwalk against a wall roughly painted in avocado green \u2013 a backdrop suited to the busy patterns and sun-lounger stripes on the clothes.</p> <p>Dubbed Sea, Sun and Love, it was a commercial and likeable collection. The accessories were particularly strong. Swinging chandelier earrings, a follow-up to this summer's pasta styles, looked like jolly tourist trinkets but were, in fact, based on Sicilian puppets, head-shaped ceramic vases from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caltagirone\" title=\"\">Caltagirone</a> or the decor from traditional local wheelbarrows \u2013 all key inspirations for the prints this season, too. Sculptural wooden wedges featured flowers on their heel. Flats came with cute pom-poms. Women wore printed headscarves.</p> <p>The last dress featured a basket-shaped skirt, inspired by those used traditionally to carry fruit, topped with a sheer black layer. This basket effect was also used on corsets \u2013 sometimes worn with trademark black lace. A grand finale saw a pack of models \u2013 a signature Dolce trick \u2013 in swimwear descend on to the catwalk to applause. Backstage, Domenico Dolce confirmed that this collection was all about \"the idea of glamorous holidays in Sicily\".</p> <p>Bolder, wide stripes are the headline trend for next season. Here, they came on simple sundresses in red with white or monochrome \u2013 the latter was also used on a top featuring both vertical and horizontal stripes, worn with striped knicker-length shorts.</p> <p>The prints included a large wheelbarrow-wheel detail \u2013 a short-sleeve top with this motif was tucked into a high-waist skirt made from raffia. Others featured lemons, maps and images of wooden marionettes holding armour, a symbol of Sicilian folk art.</p> <p>Italian authenticity is central to the Dolce brand. Its newest shop in Milan is the very opposite of the hi-tech stores with state-of-the-art gadgets that are being opened by the likes of <a href=\"http://uk.burberry.com/store/\" title=\"\">Burberry</a>. Instead, this building is decked out with retro furniture, sourced from flea markets or antique stores around Milan. The floor of chestnut, white maple, cherry, oak and rosewood has been made from antique rafters of Milanese and Venetian houses. The ceramics referenced in this show are on display.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, <a href=\"http://www.marni.com/home.asp?tskay=B84CE7A2\" title=\"\">Marni </a>showed one of the strongest collections in Milan, based around interesting shapes, volume and proportion. Prints were punctuated with clean, monochrome outfits and leather.</p> <p>Signature patterns opened the show with a square check and a thick cross, which were printed on to flared skirts, dresses and coats. A sliced dot-and-flower pattern also featured. These looked guaranteed to please loyal customers, who come to this label for wearable, patterned clothes.</p> <p>This season, their plain pieces were also extremely desirable. Crisp white dresses are a key look for next spring. Marni's take on the idea was executed beautifully, with interesting back views. Folds and pleats added a lovely sense of movement, while one outstanding dress featured an elegant, deep V-neckline in the back.</p> <p>Designer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consuelo_Castiglioni\" title=\"\">Consuelo Castiglioni</a>, who recently collaborated on a range for <a href=\"http://www.hm.com/gb/\" title=\"\">H&amp;M</a>, also experimented with the peplum.

  "<p>The Libyan authorities have given armed groups two days to vacate military bases and compounds as they seek to capitalise on the wave of people power that drove an Islamist militia from Benghazi at the weekend.</p> <p>Jihadist militias in Derna, Libya's Islamist stronghold, threw in the towel on Sunday, withdrawing from their stronghold and announcing they were disbanding to avoid a repeat of the scenes in Benghazi in which angry crowds sent armed gunmen fleeing. One of the routed militias was blamed for an attack on the US consulate two weeks ago that left four Americans dead including the ambassador, Chris Stevens.</p> <p>The de facto head of state, Muhammad Magariaf, president of Libya's parliament, met Benghazi politicians and security officials, anxious to fill a security vacuum that has emerged from the weekend violence, in which at least 11 people died.</p> <p>\"The army chief Yussef al-Mangoush and Muhammad Magariaf have ordered all illegitimate militias should be removed from compounds and hand over their weapons to the national army,\" said Adel Othman al-Barasi, a spokesman for the defence ministry, according to Reuters. \"A committee made up by the military police has been formed to take over the compounds and the weapons and hand these over to the army.\"</p> <p>Benghazi's army garrison commander, General Hamad Belkhair, said he was moving military police units into vacated militia bases. \"What happened was a big mess,\" he said of the takeover by protesters of Benghazi's three militia bases on Friday night and Saturday morning. \"But it has left the government clearly in control of the streets.\"</p> <p>Bilal Bettamer, a 22-year-old law student in the city who was one of the organisers of the Benghazi protests, said he was optimistic the militias would be disbanded. \"You can't have 100% success in these situations. [But] that's what we wanted \u2013 the militias are put on notice and everyone knows now that this country will refuse any extremists and will eventually get rid of them, and become a country that we wanted on 17 February.\"</p> <p>He condemned the apparent killing of militia guards as a \"stupid move\" and speculated that pro-Gaddafi elements could be to blame. He even praised the courage of the militias for disbanding, claiming it showed they respected democracy.</p> <p>\"Militias are not evil people, they are good people and they have saved Libya before. But it is time for legitimacy to take its place for the police and army. You can't build a country based on militias.</p> <p>\"The army are back on the streets. You can see the army and police at night. The collection of individual weapons is beginning right now. They are doing their expected job. They have put small militia on notice to evacuate the neighbourhood. The army got braver. Everyone is telling them, strike with an iron fist.\"</p> <p>Yet extremists remain a presence: Belkhair himself was kidnapped on Saturday morning by masked gunmen and held for six hours before being released unharmed. He said he thought the group, who did not identify themselves, wanted him to limit the army's role in securing the city. Belkhair and police commanders are uneasily aware that the surge of people power that has swept militias from the streets could degenerate into anarchy, and that he lacks the manpower to impose order.</p> <p>An army unit from Sirte, former stronghold of the late dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, has occupied the compound of the Raffala al-Sahati militia, whose soldiers shot many of the 11 killed in the early hours of Saturday. Investigators are trying to establish who killed six militiamen whose bodies were found, each with a bullet to the head, in a field near the Raffala base.</p> <p>In Derna, a centre for Islamist resistance against the Gaddafi regime, two powerful jihadist formations, Abu Salem and Ansar al-Sharia, have agreed to disband. Commanders of both formations \u2013 the latter linked to the group blamed for the killing of Stevens \u2013 told Libya's state news agency that they had decided their role was over.</p> <p>In Tripoli, many foreign embassies remain in security lockdown, fearing jihadist units in the capital will seek revenge for the humiliating rout of their comrades in eastern Libya.</p> <p>Benghazi officials say the way is now clear for Washington to deploy an FBI team that is kicking its heels in Tripoli to join the investigation into the death of Stevens, who died from smoke inhalation after the attack on the consulate compound.</p>",
  "<p>The police and wider community in Greater Manchester must \"stand as one\" after the murders of two police officers killed in Hattersley last week to avoid such killings becoming \"commonplace\", a bishop said as locals attended remembrance services.</p> <p>Five days after PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes died in a gun and grenade attack while responding to an apparently routine incident, the Right Rev Mark Davies, Roman Catholic bishop of Shrewsbury, told about 50 churchgoers that the officers lost their lives \"in fulfilling their duty for our protection\".</p> <p>\"If our children are not to grow up accepting the murders of Tuesday as commonplace then the police and the community must stand as one in defence of human life, overcoming whatever obstacles may prevent this trust,\" he said during mass at St James the Great in Hattersley.</p> <p>\"The police are there to protect us, but our protection must also be found within ourselves \u2013 in the moral values on which our homes and families are built, in the strength of our community.\"</p> <p>Dale Cregan, of no fixed address, has been charged with both murders and is due to appear via videolink at Manchester crown court on Monday.

A book of condolence was put on display for the public to sign at the local church, and a service of reflection was due to take place at Mottram parish church, just half a mile from where the gun and grenade attack took place.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC 1's Songs of Praise, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Sir Peter Fahy, said a prayer vigil would be held on Tuesday for colleagues of the dead officers and any members of the public who wished to attend. \"It is that sort of human need to express emotion to be together,\" he said, adding that praying for the officers and their families was many people's \"own expression of hope\" at a time when it would be possible to feel hopeless.</p> <p>For many police officers, Fahy said, their work was a vocation rather than just a job. \"I think a lot of us feel passionately that policing is a vocation; it is a calling,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I feel that in terms of my own faith, but I know lots of officers who don't have a faith feel exactly that \u2026 that it is a vocation, it's not just a job, and I think that's what almost you go back to in difficult times and in difficult circumstances: that, how unfair something may feel, that how inadequate you may feel, you do actually rely on at the end of the day you're doing your best and this is your vocation.\"</p> <p>Canon David Wilbraham, the national police chaplain, told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme that the killings had raised \"profoundly deep questions\" for all in the police service regardless of whether they were religious.</p> <p>\"For some people faith is an important part of life and that's absolutely fine,\" he said. \"For others it may not play a part, but at a time like this I think a lot of people are spiritual even if they wouldn't say they had a card-carrying faith.</p> <p>\"It raises very deep questions I think for all of us when we see things on this scale about what life means, about how we live as a society, and they're profoundly deep questions that I think everyone regardless of faith or belief does question at times like this.\"</p> <p>Wilbraham added that, despite the \"tremendous\" sadness and shock felt within the policing community, he had not heard calls for greater precaution to be taken or for officers to be routinely armed.</p> <p>Fahy said the tradition of an unarmed force was held very dearly. \"We believe very much in what Robert Peel laid down for us back in 1829 \u2013 that we are a routinely unarmed police force, that we use the minimum of force, that we have this very close connection with the community we serve and that is really, really important to us,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The Kop stirred one more time to sing Brendan Rodgers's name but the final tribute of an emotional, absorbing and controversial Anfield afternoon was motivated by sympathy not acclaim for the Liverpool manager. He is without a win after five league games in charge and, after Manchester United's first victory here in five years, luckless too.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson received the points and his team the benefit of every contentious decision as Robin van Persie's late penalty, United's first successful effort from the spot in four this season, applied gloss to their mediocre display.</p> <p>Ferguson was also labelled a \"grass\" by Jonjo Shelvey for an unseen role in the midfielder's decisive first-half dismissal, the one major call from the referee Mark Halsey over which Liverpool could have no complaint. Not that it prevented Rodgers from trying.</p> <p>\"If Jonjo gets sent off then Jonny Evans has to be sent off as well,\" the Liverpool manager said. Both players had gone two-footed into a 50-50 challenge shortly before the interval but it has to be considered \"careless, reckless or using excessive force\" for a referee to show red and only Shelvey was adjudged guilty on that score.</p> <p>\"It was a tackle that both players had to go for but the Liverpool player can't be sent off and the Manchester United player stay on. It was very, very harsh and that's how it was throughout the game. There were a number of poor decisions that cost us.\"</p> <p>Rodgers's frustration was understandable. Liverpool were the dominant force with 11 men, took a deserved lead with10 and, on the penalty award that ultimately gave United victory and perhaps an Evans challenge on Luis Su\u00e1rez inside the United area, his grievance had legitimacy. He also had to contend with the loss of Fabio Borini, Daniel Agger and Martin Kelly to injury, the Italian forward and Danish defender potentially seriously.</p> <p>\"The best team lost,\" he added, and that brooked no argument. Even Ferguson conceded; \"A win's a win, so we've got to be pleased with the result, but not the performance.\"</p> <p>The tribute to the victims of Hillsborough and their families had been impeccably observed by everyone inside Anfield before the kick-off, Su\u00e1rez shook hands with Patrice Evra and the focus of the pre-match concern passed without incident. Which made it all the more ridiculous that the controversy should erupt from a Liverpool player with his team in the ascendancy.</p> <p>Rodgers's team dominated the first half thanks in the main to the prodigious pressing and work-rate of Steven Gerrard and Joe Allen in central midfield, Su\u00e1rez up front and an intelligent display on the right by the 17-year-old, Raheem Sterling. By contrast, United were slow to the ball and sloppy in possession, with Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick anonymous and Nani a liability out on the left.</p> <p>Anders Lindegaard, selected ahead of David de Gea in a visiting defence missing Nemanja Vidic, made the game's first save from Su\u00e1rez's angled shot across goal and only instinctive reactions from Rafael and Carrick prevented Borini and Gerrard converting on the follow-up. The pattern hardly changed until United, with Paul Scholes added to midfield, eventually ground down Liverpool's 10 men. Gerrard escaped his marker to turn Shelvey's short corner into the side-netting via a rare touch from Van Persie and, despite creating few clear-cut openings, the home side were in control.</p> <p>Then Shelvey helped United where they needed it most by weakening Liverpool's midfield with a dangerous challenge on Evans. He left the field with a heated exchange and an accusatory finger at Ferguson.</p> <p>\"I don't think he went for the ball,\" the United manager said. \"The boy's gone in really dangerously and I don't think there's any other decision the referee could have given. He was trying to blame me, I suppose. Once he looks at it he can apologise if he likes. I think he should do that.\"</p> <p>An apology of sorts did arrive from Shelvey's Twitter account. He wrote: \"I apologise to the fans for getting sent off but no way was I pulling out of that tackle in a game of that importance. I'm sorry.\" The midfielder added: \"I have also apologised to Sir Alex, just where I come from people don't grass people up to get someone sent off.\"</p> <p>Liverpool pressed on with 10 men and it was no less than they deserved when the excellent Gerrard put them ahead a minute after the restart. United failed to clear a left wing cross from substitute Suso and the Liverpool captain capitalised to chest and volley into the bottom corner. Gerrard, who lost a cousin at Hillsborough, pointed to the sky in celebration but the lead lasted only five minutes before Antonio Valencia and Shinji Kagawa combined for Rafael to curl an exquisite left-foot shot in off the far post.</p> <p>Halsey ignored Liverpool penalty appeals after challenges by Evans and Scholes on Su\u00e1rez and Sterling respectively but awarded United a soft one when Glen Johnson was adjudged to have caught Valencia. Liverpool's converted left-back did not play the ball as Valencia dithered in the area but contact was minimal.</p> <p>Despite Jos\u00e9 Reina's best efforts and following a lengthy delay as Agger was carried off with a suspected medial knee ligament injury, Van Persie succeeded where he, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Nani had all failed this season and ended United's misery from the penalty spot. Rodgers' misfortune, by contrast, continues.</p>",
  "<p>In many ways, the life of my father-in-law, Cedric \"Macka\" Deane, who has died aged 81, epitomised the struggles and achievements of the generation of West Indian immigrants who arrived in Britain in the 1950s.</p> <p>Cedric was born and raised on the island of Nevis. His mother died when he was four and, with an absent father, his childhood was one of hardship yet it paved the way for his resilience and determination. After leaving school he took on various jobs, including as a chauffeur, before deciding to leave the island to improve his chances in England.</p> <p>He arrived in Leeds in 1955, leaving behind his wife, Josephine, and their family, who joined him in the Chapeltown area in 1961. Cedric worked exceptionally hard in difficult and sometimes dangerous jobs. His first was at the gas works in Leeds; he would come home from double shifts covered in coal dust, coughing for hours in the evening. He stayed there for 16 years and, after being made redundant, moved to the hot, oppressive environment of Kirkstall forge. Finally, he switched to Yorkshire Imperial Metals, where he stayed until his retirement.</p> <p>The driving force behind Cedric's working life was the desire to give his children the start he never had, and by the early 60s he and Josephine had managed to buy their own house. Much of his energy was channelled into conveying to his children the cherished values of independence, hard work, education, ambition and pride. As a result each met success in their chosen field, including in the armed forces, the legal profession, medicine, business and sport. His son Brian was a professional footballer who played for Leeds United and England; his son Steven was a British and Commonwealth Thai-boxing champion.</p> <p>A private family man, Cedric was a disciplinarian given to few words and, had he not originally hailed from the Caribbean, might have had his blunt, independent attributes mistaken for those of a typical Yorkshireman. But he had a dry sense of humour and mellowed considerably in his old age.</p> <p>He enjoyed a frequent whisky, and after a couple of drams, was fond of reciting two poems that reflected the Scottish ancestry on his father's side: The Sea-King's Burial by Charles Mackay and The Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna by Charles Wolfe. He was also an Elvis Presley fan and an aficionado of wrestling and boxing.</p> <p>He is survived by Josephine; his sister, Enid; his children, Tony, Steven, Brian, Wilma, Claristine and Shirley; 12 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.His two brothers predeceased him.</p>",

Correct me if I'm wrong but I do believe that's why we're all here in the first place. Good.</p> <p>There are probably better sides to be facing when you're still looking for your first league win than Manchester United but that's the challenge facing Liverpool this afternoon. It has not been an easy start to life for Brendan Rodgers at Anfield, for while his side have passed the ball daintily, their approach has not been accompanied by the requisite punch up front, a familiar failing for Liverpool. They have only managed three goals in their first four games and two of those have come from set-pieces, the other from a Titus Bramble assist. Just as worrying are the defensive mistakes and the comedy stylings of Pepe the Clown in goal. </p> <p>Yet Liverpool do come into this game on the back of a hot one-game winning streak, following their ripsnorting 5-3 win over Young Boys in the Europa League on Thursday, and they do tend to save their very best form for this fixture. United, who have not made a wholly convincing start to the season, do not like coming to Anfield. It spooks them. In recent years, they have been bullied here, largely because of their lack of a midfield, and they have not won at Liverpool since a Carlos Tevez goal gave them a 1-0 victory in December 2007. If Liverpool can add controlled aggression to their passing game, then United could be in for an uncomfortable afternoon. Having said that Liverpool have won just twice at home in the league this year and United have Robin van Persie up front, while Liverpool have: </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 1.30pm.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news.</strong> Apart from the absence of the injured Lucas, Liverpool are at full strength in midfield, where Jonjo Shelvey is preferred to Nuri Sahin. For Manchester United, Nemanja Vidic is spared his inevitable Anfield red card by a mystery injury, so Jonny Evans partners Rio Ferdinand in central defence.

In exchange for one or two ball winners, tacklers, players who won't crumble immediately under the outpouring of Anfield grief, I would gladly do without van Persie. Going to lose today. And yes i know vaguely applicable midfielders are unavailable, Fletcher being ill, Jones injured, Anderson pants etc.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Word is that Nemanja Vidic is being rested.</strong> Which is strange. Anyway the teams are in the tunnel. They're both wearing red tracksuit tops. United's has \"96\" on the back. Out come the players to a strangely muted atmopshere.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>HANDSHAKE LATEST:</strong> Patrice Evra and Luis Suarez shake hands without any fuss at all. And let that be the end of it. \"That Jose Mourinho's a pretty smart bloke; who'd have ever thought Liverpool wouldn't win the league this season because their team isn't good enough,\" says Rob Moline. \"No wonder Florentino Perez was so keen to snap him up.

The message is simple: \"THE TRUTH\".</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>And as You'll Never Walk Alone ends, the game begins.</strong> United, in their white shirts and black shorts, kick off. They're attacking the Kop in the first half, though I'm not sure if the Liverpool fans are paying too much attention yet. They're still chanting \"Justice for the 96\". It's loud but there's an eerie atmosphere around Anfield.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> And now, finally, a roar. \"Yup, you're right about United's \"lack of a midfield\" being the root cause of many of their recent problems at Anfield: see, eg, the game at Anfield in the league in Rafa's otherwise abysmal last season in charge when Lucas simply harried the ball off the ancient Scholes, drove at the United goal and put Kuyt through only for the Dutchman to blast wide in classic Kuyt-style,\" says SB Tang. \"Not sure if Liverpool will be able to make United pay to the requisite degree for starting Giggs in central midfield today though. In the absence of Lucas, we don't have a real terrier in midfield. And United will have the mobile, hardworking Kagawa dropping back to help out when they lose the ball ...\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> United are dominating possession in these early stages, albeit without really going anywhere. That's often been the case at Anfield in recent years.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Young Sterling, the father of three children at the tender age of 17, gets his first chance to run at Patrice Evra. He might be experienced in some regards but he's still a fresh-faced youth on the pitch and Evra quickly steps in to nick the ball off him.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Three children at 17 though.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Liverpool win the first corner of the match, Johnson's cross deflected behind by Rafael. They take it short but Gerrard's fine cross is headed away firmly by Rafael.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Liverpool win the first corner, United have the first shot. Kagawa finds Giggs on the edge of the area and he cuts across the ball with his left foot - rather like Xavi against Granada last night - and his shot fizzes just past the angle of post and bar. By way of response, Liverpool go right up the other end, Sterling playing a neat pass down the inside-right channel for Suarez. He turns a cross-shot into the area that Lindegaard parries out rather shakily, forcing Rafael to head away from Borini, doing superbly not to score an own goal. Gerrard tries to turn home the rebound but Evans is on hand to boot clear. More please!</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Half of the ground thought this was in. The impressive Sterling won another corner on the right. Shelvey cut the ball back low to Gerrard, whose low drive fizzed past the right post and into the side-netting, creating the illusion that he had beaten Lindegaard. Sadly not. United were nearly caught out in similar fashion by Galatasaray on Wednesay. You'd think they'd be wise to that ruse by now.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> \"I think Ferguson has dug his heels in on the midfield issue,\" says Mark Judd. \"He knows what everyone else knows but is too stubborn to admit it. Buy Cheik Tiote in January.\" They do look very lightweight at the moment. Liverpool are the more cohesive side.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> The buccaneering Johnson tumbles under a challenge from Rafael on the left but Mark Halsey waves away his appeals for a free-kick. He accepts the decision with equanimity. Just as well, seeing as it wasn't a foul.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Liverpool are making chances. Liverpool aren't taking chances. What's new? Suarez pierces the shambles masquerading as the United defence with a pass through to Borini. He's clean through on goal and should score but his first touch is utterly dreadful, taking him away from goal. In the end, all he can do is try to turn it across goal but too many United defenders are back. The young Italian gets an earful from Suarez and Gerrard for his sloppiness. Andy Carroll definitely would have scored that. Maybe.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> You know who would have scored that? Steven Fletcher. What a brilliantly instinctive finisher he is.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> It's all Liverpool. Joe Allen does this really neat thing. He passes the ball to a team-mate.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> A quick look at the possession stats reveals that Liverpool have had 64% of it. But they're yet to turn it into a goal which is, of course, supposedly the object of all this.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Liverpool have had three corners to United's nice round zero. Gerrard curls it in from the left but Van Persie heads away at the near post. That might be the first time he's touched it.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Liverpool continue to turn the screw though and from Van Persie's clearance, Gerrard curls a delicious inswinging cross into the box from the left. Agger collapses with Evans keeping a close hold on him but Mark Halsey says no penalty despite loud appeals. There's a stoppage in play, meanwhile, as Rio Ferdinand gets treatment for an injury. Worryingly United's only defensive option on the bench is the inexperienced left-back Alex Buttner.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Ferdinand is back on the pitch but he's still limping. That decision to rest Vidic is looking curiouser and curiouser.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> \"I don't disagree with your assessment of Steven Fletcher, but it's a pity he is either too stupid to too stubborn to admit when he's made a mistake,\" says Simon McMahon. \"Maybe he should give Nick Clegg a call as well as Craig Levein.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> <strong>UNITED GET INTO LIVERPOOL'S HALF!!!!!!!!</strong></p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Nani wallops a free-kick well over the bar from 35 yards out. Maybe he shouldn't take the set pieces for a while.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Suarez tries a cute chip into the top-right corner from the edge of the area but his aim is awry.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Suarez is so frustrating at times. He got clear on the left side of the area and was faced by two United defenders. Suddenly memories of his mesmeric run against United in March 2011 came flooding back so instead of just crossing it, he tried to diddle his way past Ferdinand, who stands up and gets a foot in to howls of annoyance from the home fans.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> The increasingly erratic Evra goes steaming through the back of Sterling as the young winger nicked the ball past the United full-back <em>inches</em> outside the area on the right. Dear me, that was woeful defending. Evra escapes with a final warning, though.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Gerrard whips the free-kick into the area from the right, but Suarez gets too much on his header when it needed to be a glance and the ball flies behind for a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Suarez threatens again. He scampers into the area from the left but his fierce shot is deflected behind by Ferdinand, who looks to be back in full working order again. The corner comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> They say managers have to be brave and you have to admire Sir Alex Ferguson's courage in not picking a midfield today.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Kelly bursts down the right, unimpeded by anything as novel as a tackle from a United player. His cross is cut out by Evans but then Nani helpfully picks out Sterling on the edge of the area. He jinks past one challenge but his left-footed shot is blocked by a United defender. United are awful.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> <strong>LIVERPOOL PRESS THE SELF-DESTRUCT BUTTON!</strong> JONJO SHELVEY IS SENT OFF! All that dominance and now they're down to 10 men. Shelvey had an inexplicable rush of blood to the head here as he got too excited after tackling Ryan Giggs. He then rushed to challenge Evans but his studs were up and he caught him with his right boot. The strange thing about this incident is the way Evans went into the 50-50 wasn't exactly great either. A split-second later and he could have been the one sent off. Mark Halsey took his time to make his mind up but there was a certain inevitability to Shelvey going.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> After getting treatment, Evans comes back on to loud boos from the Liverpool fans. For the crime of being kicked.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> But despite only having 10 men, still Liverpool press. They win a free-kick after a push from Ferdinand 30 yards from goal. Suarez takes it and demands a good save from Lindegaard, the Dane diving to his right to push the effort away. Liverpool are very much in this, mainly because United have been so poor.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> \"How does the player with both feet off the ground stay on the pitch, and the one with one foot on the ground get a straight red!?\" says Simon Brereton. This is what I mean about Evans's part in this. You're not going to see both players sent off in an incident like that though. That said, Evans got lucky.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> As Shelvey walked off, he had a pop at Ferguson, pointing at him and effin' and jeffin'. Ferguson, naturally, did not take it in good spirit meaning Shelvey has become the first non-United player to be on the end of the hairdryer treatment. You can bet the United players are going to be in for a rollicking at half time too. Their performance is still miserable. Borini gets clear down the left but his inviting cut-back is put behind by Evra. Where was Suarez? That cross was begging to be tapped in. To think that Michael Owen's at Stoke.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Half time: Liverpool 0-0 Manchester United.</strong> Boos greet the half time whistle following Jonjo Shelvey's red card. Manchester United have been thrashed 0-0 but Liverpool are down to 10 men. Surely United can't be so lethargic against the second half, especially with the one-man advantage. Liverpool should be ahead but once again they haven't taken their chances and they could end up paying for it.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Half time emails.</strong></p> <p>\"Fergie's tactics appear to be to pick 10 idiots and assume that Van Persie will inevitably nick it when someone from Liverpool gets sent off,\" says Alec Cochrane. \"Rodgers tactics are to get it out wide and cross it in for Andy Carroll, with only one fatal flaw.\"</p> <p>\"It was a badly judged lunge from Shelvey, but replays showed Evans had both feet leading into it as well,\" says Matt Dony.</p> <p>\"On Halsey's red against Shelvey: that was as bad a decision as his subsequently rescinded red against Huddlestone,\" says SB Tang.</p> <p>\"Ferguson's bizarre selections suggest a man who is bored of winning, &amp; now wants to handicap himself to keep the challenge interesting,\" says Simon Frank. \"Remarkably few top, top, top, top, players for this massive, massive game.\"</p> <p>\"I think that crime being booed is that Evans was also studs up (see the replay, he catches Shelvey just as badly) and then rolled around like a chubby fella in a oil wrestling match,\" says Josh Collis. \"Still Shelvey ingratiated himself to all LFC fans by shouting a lot at Ferguson on the way off. A future star.\"</p> <p>\"Liverpool are awfully fired up for this game, Shelvey being sent off as a consequence of their high pressing, aggressive approach going too far,\" says David Jerome. \"Despite their team playing well however their fans have behaved disgracefully on a day that is supposed to be about reconciliation, booing Evra for being racially abused and Evans for being the victim of a challenge? Sort it out Liverpool.\" </p> <p>\"What in name of Jehova is the ref doing?\" says Rolf Mellander. \"That's a 50-50 challenge. Shelvey is doing exactly what Evans is doing. Both red or no red. Clown of a referee.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>The red card.</strong> Both players were out of control, Jonny Evans going in two-footed as well. On Sky, Gary Neville suggests that both players should have been sent off, so a booking for both might have sufficed.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>At this juncture, let us remind ourselves of Xabi Alonso's thoughts on tackling.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't think tackling is a quality. It is a recurso, something you have to resort to, not a characteristic of your game. At Liverpool I used to read the matchday programme and you'd read an interview with a lad from the youth team. They'd ask: age, heroes, strong points, etc. He'd reply: 'Shooting and tackling'. I can't get into my head that football development would educate tackling as a quality, something to learn, to teach, a characteristic of your play. How can that be a way of seeing the game? I just don't understand football in those terms. Tackling is a [last] resort, and you will need it, but it isn't a quality to aspire to, a definition. It's hard to change because it's so rooted in the English football culture, but I don't understand it.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Off we go again. Both sides have made changes, Liverpool introducing the young Spanish midfielder Suso for Borini and United introducing the Not Young midfielder Paul Scholes for the miserably ineffective Nani. And...</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 1-0 Manchester United (Gerrard, 46 min):</strong> Could it have been anyone else? Suso made an instant impact after his introduction off the bench, gloriously jinking past Scholes on the left before sending a cross that was headed away by Ferdinand. United were dawdling on the edge of the area though and Johnson charged on to the loose ball, before juggling it into the area. He couldn't keep control of it but it came to Gerrard and he chested it down before waiting for it to drop and smashing a low volley into the bottom right corner as United stood and watched. The 10 men have the lead and don't they deserve it.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Liverpool thoroughly merit this lead. There aren't many better players than Steven Gerrard when it comes to the big occasions, although that hasn't always been the case in recent years.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> The inevitable pressure from United. Van Persie swings in a cross from the left and Johnson gets a bit lucky that his header back across his own area doesn't fall to a United player. I fancy this is going to be a long 40 minutes for Liverpool.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Manchester United (Rafael, 51 min):</strong> What a goal this is from Rafael. Liverpool's goal has given United the kick up the backside they needed and they're level straight away. They were just starting to turn the screw and were enjoying their first period of sustained pressure when Rafael struck. There didn't look to be too much danger as Kagawa chested Valencia's cross down to Rafael, but the right-back took a touch and then bent a stunning left-footed curler into the far corner off the inside of the post. Reina didn't have a chance.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Valencia scampers down the right flank and wins a corner off Johnson. United are well on top at the moment. Van Persie sends the corner in and Valencia heads over and wide.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Liverpool aren't going to sit back and just let United come at them. First a raking long pass finds Sterling in behind Evra on the right of the area. He takes too long to shoot though and his eventual cross is headed away. It comes out to Gerrard whose shot is straight at Lindegaard.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Carrick slides a pass through to Van Persie, who's clear in the middle of the area. He's off balance though and slips as he goes to shoot. No penalty, despite the appeals for one.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Now it's Liverpool's turn to cry for a penalty as Suarez leaps through the air \u2013 9.5 say the judges! \u2013 after a challenge from Evans. He doesn't really help himself at times, does he?</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Try to contain your shock: Paul Scholes has been booked for a foul on Sterling.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> A rapier United counterattack ends with Evra's low cross from the left going behind Van Persie. It might not be too long before we see either Hernandez or Welbeck introduced to partner Van Persie. Kagawa hasn't done very much.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Lindegaard makes an outstanding save to stop Suarez restoring Liverpool's lead. He darted in from the right to make space for the shot and then curled a low effort towards the bottom left corner. Lindegaard got a strong hand to it. By the way, United have scored with their only shot on target.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Van Persie heads Carrick's cross well over. He was under a lot of pressure though. He's still feeding off scraps.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Despite having 10 men, Liverpool are still the superior side. Suarez breaches the United defence again and this time rolls the ball back to Suso, whose clipped effort from, 15 yards out is pushed over by Lindegaard. If they could finish, Liverpool would be a very good side.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Liverpool make their second change, Jordan Henderson replacing Raheem Sterling. Patrice Evra breathes a sigh of relief.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> United are so listless. It's as if they don't want to win it. \"The dive by Suarez had all the elements and his form was impeccable<br>but for sheer audacity I am still giving the dive of the week to Ivanovic against Stoke yesterday,\" says JR in Illinois. For sheer audacity, nothing beats <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyoRoLdWCWU\">this</a>.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Suso slips a pass through to Suarez but his cross-shot from a tight angle on the right flashes across goal and, er, out for a throw-in.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> There is no coherence to the United attacks. Liverpool are comfortable in defence. The only reason they're not winning is because of a wonder goal from United's right-back.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> <strong>PENALTY TO MANCHESTER UNITED!</strong> Out of nowhere Valencia beats Agger and Johnson to a loose ball on the halfway line and steams off upfield with Liverpool completely exposed. He tries to take it past Skrtel but just as he goes to shoot from six yards out, Johnson gets back and clips his heels. Reina is booked for his protests. Will Van Persie dink it?</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> There's a delay before Van Persie can take the penalty as Agger gets treatment for the injury he suffered when Valencia stole possession. On second glance, Liverpool might feel the penalty was soft - the contact was so light \u2013 although the fact that Johnson didn't appeal was telling, I suppose.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Agger is going to have to go off on a stretcher. He looks to have hurt his foot. It was a poor pass from Suso, the impressive youngster, who put Liverpool into trouble. He'll learn.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Agger, clutching his left leg, is taken off on a stretcher and on comes Carragher. Van Persie has had four minutes to think about this penalty. He's going to chip it, isn't he?</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 1-2 Manchester United (Van Persie pen, 81 min):</strong> United had missed their last three penalties. They almost missed this one too, Reina getting a hand to Van Persie's penalty but it was hit too firmly into the top-right corner. United have not come from behind to win at Anfield since 1952. This is a complete mugging.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Javier Hernandez replaces the disappointing Shinji Kagawa.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> What a chance. Johnson looks to make amends with a cross from the left and Kelly beats both Evra and Evans to the ball but heads it wide of the right post from six yards out. What a chance.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> The Liverpool supporters are up in arms after a studs-up challenge from Van Persie on Suso. He's booked. It wasn't too different from the challenge Shelvey was sent off. \"Everyone saying pen because Johnson didn't complain,\" says Niall Mullen. \"Everyone should scream at the ref then?\" You'd complain if you knew you hadn't touched him.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> \"Mind explaining why Johnson not appealing is telling - do you think Halsey would have changed his mind?\" says Steve Bowden. \"Reina was booked for protesting - does that make it definitely wrong?\" Because Johnson was the one penalised so probably has a better idea than Reina. For what it's worth, I want to see it again. The contact, if there was any, looked very soft.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> There's going to be a lot of stoppage time, of course. The delay before Van Persie took his penalty was four minutes and there will be more than that added on.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Danny Welbeck replaces the hobbling Rafael. Presumably Valencia will go to right-back. \"Did nobody take into account that Johnson probably didn't complain because he was lying on the ground in pain having taken a knee to the chest from Reina during the penalty incident?\" says David Flynn. \"Whether he agreed or didn't he had other things on his mind, like trying to breathe.\"</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be five minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>90 min+2:</strong> Mark Halsey is not endearing himself to the locals. United have a free-kick after a foul by Henderson on Evans. \"Sorry to ruin the fun,\" says Benedict Simmons. \"His response was the mark of a man who knew he'd fudged it for his team. He just lay on the ground. He went to ground on the halfway line, then got into a position which would let the ref get conned by Valencia and there was nothing he could to about it.\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>90 min+3:</strong> All is not going to plan for Liverpool. Now Martin Kelly is down injured. I can't believe they're not going to win this match. They probably should have signed a striker in the summer. I'm not yet sure that Borini counts.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>90 min+5:</strong> Hernandez's weak effort is snaffled by Reina. One last attack for Liverpool now. Reina will launch it long. Andy Carroll might have been useful in this situation.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>90 min+7:</strong> Mark Halsey is not a popular man. Ferdinand goes through the back of Suarez on the edge of area. Play continues.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>Full time: Liverpool 1-2 Manchester United.</strong> After one of their worst performances in recent memory, Manchester United have their first victory at Anfield since 2007 and move up to second in the table. The victory papers over the cracks in this side though, because for long periods they were absolutely dire. Yet they got the rub of the green with the refereeing decisions, which means they leave with the points. Somehow Liverpool end a match they dominated from start to finish empty-handed. They're 18th in the table after five matches. It will get better though. Thanks for reading. Bye.</p>",
  "<p>Failed plans fall into three categories. There are good plans that are poorly executed, as in the blueprint drawn up by Count Alfred von Schlieffen for the invasion of France in 1914. There are strategically bad plans that are well executed, as in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812. And then there's the coalition government's deficit reduction plan.</p> <p>Last Friday's monthly update on the public finances was grim reading for George Osborne and his Liberal Democrat sidekick Danny Alexander. Back in the happy days of 2010 the talk was of how an ambitious plan to reduce the red ink splattered all over the Treasury's books could be combined with robust growth and the protection of frontline services. Not one of these objectives has been met.</p> <p>The quality of public services has been diminished by job cuts, the economy has hit the wall and, perhaps most tellingly of all, the gap between what the government spends and what it receives in taxes is getting bigger, not smaller.</p> <p>The deficit last month was more than \u00a314bn, slightly up on the previous year and a record for any August. On budget day, the chancellor said he expected the deficit to fall by more than 4% in the current financial year; in the first five months of 2012-13 it is 21% up on 2011-12. It will take a rapid \u2013 and wholly unlikely \u2013 acceleration in growth over the next few months for Osborne to have the remotest chance of hitting his forecasts.</p> <p>More probably, he will have to use his autumn statement in early December to admit that he is going to break at least one of the rules he set himself for control of the public finances when he became chancellor. The target of reducing debt as a share of national income by the end of this parliament already looks fanciful given the flatlining of the economy over the past 18 months, leaving Osborne with the choice of setting a new, less onerous challenge or announcing fresh austerity plans.</p> <p>Humiliating though it will be, the chancellor will almost certainly take the first option. The deficit reduction plan already implies greater austerity in 2013-14 and 2014-15 than in the current financial year, and it would be a brave chancellor who would remove extra demand from an economy already fragile. The idea of expansionary fiscal contraction \u2013 getting tough with the budget boosts growth by allowing monetary policy to work its magic \u2013 has proved a dud. Why? Because the banking system is broken and the over-indebted are not interested in taking on more debt no matter how far interest rates fall. Osborne and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) have massively overestimated the power of monetary policy, so to further tighten fiscal policy would result in even weaker growth and make the government's fiscal objectives even harder to achieve.</p> <p>Osborne will fall back on the defence used by every chancellor since time immemorial: blame the foreigner. Had it not been for the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone, the rise in oil prices, and the sluggishness of the global economy, he will say, everything would be going swimmingly by now. There was nothing wrong with the plan. It was a super plan. It was, indeed, the only plan that could have saved Britain from Greek-style debt dystopia. It was just that other people messed things up.</p> <p>Sir Mervyn King is providing the chancellor with a certain amount of political cover for his U-turn. The governor of the Bank of England says it will be all right for the government to miss its debt target provided it is the result of external factors and not due to his going soft on deficit reduction itself. Given that King stood four square behind Osborne's austerity from the outset and has used the same defence for the bank's record of consistently over-estimating growth and under-estimating inflation, his support is unsurprising but welcome if it prevents Osborne from compounding his own errors.</p> <p>For while it is true that Labour's stewardship of the public finances left a lot to be desired in advance of the Great Crash of 2007 and that any government faced with a budget deficit of 11% of national output would be forced to take steps to balance the books, the fact is that Osborne's plan was ill-conceived, hastily drawn up, based on overly optimistic forecasts and executed in such a way as to amplify the pain felt by the public.</p> <p>The failings of Plan A are explored by Brian Reading in a paper for Lombard Street Research called The Blunt Axe. The title is a reference to the so-called Geddes Axe, the programme of deep spending cuts imposed in the early 1920s following close scrutiny of where savings could be made.</p> <p>Reading's assessment of Osborne's approach is scathing, arguing that it failed miserably to accomplish the coalition's \"urgent priority to secure economic stability at a time of continuing uncertainty in the global economy\". In particular, the paper says there was no attempt to assess the impact on growth of spending cuts, the government hid behind \"rosy forecasts\" provided by the OBR, it \"slashed and burned\" investment apart from expensive prestige projects, it made no attempt to identify where taxpayers' money was to be saved, failed to measure the real resources provided to departments given the different inflation rates that apply to services such as health, failed to protect frontline workers (or even identify what work they did), and made no plans for the inevitable cuts in public sector employment, which at 372,000 in the first two years are almost six times as high as the 66,000 estimated by the OBR.</p> <p>Reading concludes that there was no need for Plan A to savage growth. The coalition, he says, could have substantially boosted investment spending without breaking its own fiscal rules. Instead, net investment spending in 2014-15 is forecast to be almost 60% lower than it was five years earlier. This is not a new phenomenon. Governments of all stripes always find it easier to cut capital spending than current spending, despite the long (and often short) term consequences for the economy.</p> <p>Nor is Reading convinced by the argument that everything can be blamed on events on the other side of the Channel. \"The deteriorating global environment and euro-debacle undoubtedly damaged the British economy, but were foreseeable. The OBR was an accomplice, persistently awarding pass marks despite darkening skies.\" Calling for a new Geddes commission, he concludes: \"The axe was blunt, the axeman blind.\"</p> <p>In one respect, Osborne is right. The public finances are in a terrible mess and need to be fixed. Ed Balls will have to come up with a credible blueprint if Labour wins the next election. But what the past two and a half years have proved beyond doubt is that a deficit reduction plan without a growth plan is no deficit reduction plan at all.</p>",

  "<p>Since <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/12/05/382209/observed-warming-since-1950-was-manmade/\">1950</a>, humans have manufactured more goods than have ever existed in history. Our consumption of those goods \u2013 a highly inefficient use of our natural capital \u2013 has wrought a long list of environmental consequences. Staggering <a href=\"http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0803.htm\">deforestation</a>, check. Increasing greenhouse gas <a href=\"http://climate.nasa.gov/causes/\">emissions</a>, check. Rising heat, sea level, and incidence of extreme weather events \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/\">check, check and check</a>.</p> <p>To environmental experts, such evidence is the proverbial writing on the wall: we must transition to a low-carbon economy, stat, in order to avoid irrevocable damage. As President Obama <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/09/06/810901/obama-to-nation-climate-change-is-not-a-hoax-more-droughts-and-floods-and-wildfires-are-not-a-joke/\">affirmed</a>, upon accepting his party's nomination for president, no less:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They're a threat to our children's future.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>The president's choice of words seemed a pointed response to Republican Senator James Inhofe, author of <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/03/09/441515/inhofe-god-says-global-warming-is-a-hoax/\">The Greatest Hoax</a> and, it's worth noting, recipient of <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cycle=Career&amp;type=I&amp;cid=N00005582&amp;newMem=N\">$1.3m</a> in campaign contributions from the oil and gas lobby.</p> <p>Political maneuvering aside, why are Americans so disengaged from climate change \u2013 arguably, one of the most critical problems of our time? </p> <p>Denial ain't just a river in Egypt; it's also in places like North Carolina and perhaps even embedded into America's cultural DNA. According to the <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/climate/publications/Six-Americas-March-2012/\">latest study</a> from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, the American public's concern about global warming can be sorted into six categories, ranging from alarmed (13%) and concerned (26%), to cautious, disengaged, doubtful and dismissive (that's the other 61% of us). Among the many explanations offered for the knowledge gap are clashing worldviews, varying education levels, demographics, and the media's handling of the issue. </p> <p>Even as evidence for climate change mounts and the consequences of the phenomenon become more severe, the amount of climate coverage on broadcast networks has plummeted. According to a stunning analysis by <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/04/16/study-climate-coverage-plummets-on-broadcast-ne/184103\">Media Matters</a>, the Sunday morning current affairs shows averaged about one hour each on climate change in 2009, compared to averaging 21 minutes apiece in 2010 and only 9 minutes per program in 2011. In 2011, Fox News Sunday covered climate change the most (just under an hour), \"but much of the coverage promoted the 'Climategate' controversy and downplayed the threat of climate change,\" reports Media Matters.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, CBS had the least climate change coverage, devoting four minutes to the topic in three years. Altogether, in 2011, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox spent twice as much time discussing Donald Trump's \"will he, won't he\" run for president rather than climate change. In fact, NBC's Meet the Press devoted 23 minutes to Trump that year \u2013 but not a single minute to climate change.</p> <p>While there is virtually no mention of climate change in the local news, reporters have turned the weather into a national pastime. Perhaps this is because storms, hurricanes and tornadoes ignite a primal reaction, whereas climate change requires an intellectual one. There is also a perception of trust that grows from constant visibility on television \u2013 although we poke fun at the weatherman, we still hide in our closets during tornado warnings. On the other hand, we regard PhD-level climate scientists with suspicion, even though their work must hold up to rigorous peer review. The weather versus climate conflict illustrates what behavioral economists have said for years: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We base our decisions on emotion far more than reason.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Flawed climate risk perception may also explain why meteorologists have an advantage over climate scientists in making immediate weather more urgent than climate change. Although hard data do influence thinking, the psychology of risk perception is complicated. Often, our fears defy reason and statistics. For instance, blood-curdling events like shark attacks and plane crashes scare the living daylights out of us, when we have more reason to be afraid of climbing into our cars each morning: sharks claim <a href=\"http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/isaf/2011summary.html\">about 12 lives per year</a>, while car crash fatalities average <a href=\"http://money.msn.com/auto-insurance/the-deadliest-month-on-the-road.aspx\">around 93 per day</a>. In the case of climate change, fear over problems that will affect us 50 years from now cannot compare with fear of challenges we face today. What people don't understand is that climate change is, in fact, already affecting our economy.</p> <p>It's understandable that our perception of risk may lead us to focus on surviving an immediate disaster more than preventing a future one. But it defies logic that so many would fall prey to \"infotainers\" such as Glenn Beck, who uses sustainable development as fodder for jokes. From McKinney, Texas to Trenton, New Jersey, sustainable development projects are being held up due to <a href=\"http://citizenreviewonline.org/ocean-county-new-jersey-blasts-un-agenda-21-in-resolution/\">aggressive pushback and fear-mongering</a> over Agenda 21, a voluntary initiative that some suspect to be diabolical attempt on the part of the UN to force a one-world government. </p> <p>Fortunately, most folks are not held back by reactionary ideology so much as basic lack of exposure to the problem. More than 1 billion people live in low-lying coastal areas, and most live in poverty. Already, at least <a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2010/08/18/coming-flood-climate-refugees?page=full\">25 million climate refugees</a> and counting are facing the consequences. For them, climate change is no longer an abstract concept to get their minds around; they are literally wading through it.</p> <p>Seeing is believing. If weak perception of risk is our blind spot, we needn't let the media keep us in the dark. Instead, we can use media \u2013 pictures, videos and websites such as National Geographic \u2013 to confront the challenges, and so mobilize citizens and students toward solutions. Weather may fade, but pictures of <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/09/extreme-weather/sidebar-textl\">post-drought west Texas</a>, hurricane-ravaged <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2006/08/hurricane-aftermath/slideshow-interactive\">New Orleans</a> and submerging countries such as <a href=\"http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/big-thaw/\">Tuvalu</a> are a stark reminder that climate change carries not only an economic or environmental toll, but also a human one. </p> <p>Sure, we can always evacuate, but we cannot get around paying a price for avoiding climate change. And the price \u2013 like the sea level \u2013 keeps rising.</p>",
  "<p>I was a pupil at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_Brothers_College_Rosalie\">Marist Brothers College Rosalie</a> in Brisbane, Queensland Australia, a school set up to educate working class boys. My first motivation to teach was Gerard DeSilva, my history teacher and my form tutor. Every time he opened his mouth I felt inspired; he gave me my academic and intellectual hook on which to hang nostalgia.</p> <p>My second motivation was my father. He really struggled in school. In every classroom I've ever taught in I've looked for him, the kid who's struggling, the kid who doesn't understand and is unhappy. But I suppose the real reason I teach is ideological. I'm doing something that's not driven by making a profit but to help people. The Marist Brothers who taught me had a genuine vocation for teaching. I guess I wanted to be that person too.</p> <p>I was about 15 years old when I first realised teaching was for me. The school arranged work experience for me to spend two weeks in a primary school just outside Brisbane. It was confronting. I'd come from a settled home and, for the first time, I met kids who were experiencing domestic violence. I had no way of comprehending it at that age. It really got to me initially in a negative way but then developed into a positive angle - I realised there was a battle to be won to help children. In year 12 I resolved to do a BA in history and then my PGDipEd. It was very tough going and I remember by the October (that's the end of term not the beginning in Australia) I was suffering burn out. I was holding down a part-time job too as duty manager of a supermarket, doing my teaching practice and the course. It was intense.</p> <p>I was lucky to get a job straight away at <a href=\"http://www.tmc.qld.edu.au/joomla/\">Tamborine Mountain College</a> which had been set up by the principal just three years before in response to a need for a school - prior to that kids had to be bussed off the mountain. It was an idyllic place on the Gold Coast hinterland. I got the job because in the middle of the interview the principal started insulting my old school. I went for him and defended the school vigorously. So I got the job. He wanted someone who would be passionate about his school - most of the interviewees had agreed with him when he'd tried a similar tactic. I stayed working at the school for five years and during that time the school tripled in size. I learned an awful lot there about meaningful behaviour change and the importance of community. But I left when my year 8s got to year 12. It seemed the right thing to do to leave with them and besides I'd reached a personal crossroads of sorts.</p> <p>I then got a job in the UK at Thamesbridge College in Reading (now <a href=\"http://www.johnmadejskiacademy.co.uk/\">John Madjeski Academy</a>) it was as rough as guts in those days. So I went from having tiny classes and biddable children who would do anything I asked them to classes that seemed full of children with behaviour issues ranging from willful disobedience to vicious violence. For the first three weeks as my bus drew up to the school I felt sick; I had to literally fight down the vomit. But things began to normalise and I realised I could do it. I was actually assaulted by one child who wanted to hit some kids who had locked themselves in a room. I said: \"If you want to get to them you are going to have to hit me.\" So he did. He smacked me across the face. I've never experienced anything like that in my life and I've been hit by men. My first thought was \"don't cry.\" But I said: \"I'll let you have that but if it happens again I'll fight back.\" I didn't take it further because I'd asked him to hit me, and he came to apologise to me later on. It ended up that his mother worked as a prostitute and those kids had been mocking him for that. I met the best teachers I've ever encountered at that school \u2013 some of them had taught there for as long as I'd been alive.</p> <p>I have found that kids really enjoy having someone from an international background as their teacher, especially more deprived kids. It's a really positive factor for them and offers an avenue of aspiration. After Thamesbridge, I went on to become head of year and head of RE at John Hunt of Everest school in Basingstoke, it was another deprived area and there was at that time a real influx of Polish immigrants into the UK. Lots of kids were bitching about immigrants. I asked: \"So are you saying that immigrants shouldn't be allowed into the country?\" \"Yes\" they said. \"Well, that's me\". There was silence. I hope I helped them realise immigration can have a positive effect.</p> <p>I've also taught in Parma, Italy. I was a chaperone for a group of year 12 students from Tamborine to <a href=\"http://www.convittomarialuigia.pr.it/\">Convitto Nazionale Maria Luigia</a>. I taught English there and did a bit of rugby coaching for two months. It was a great experience although I went home two and a half stone heavier. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/oliver\">Jamie Oliver</a> would have swooned over their canteen, beautiful homecooked Italian food and half a bottle of wine each for the teachers. After lunch, we had a little kip - heaven.</p> <p>As part of a fellowship I received from the <a href=\"http://www.wcmt.org.uk/\">Winston Churchill Memorial Trust</a> (WMCT) fellowship, I've also worked with schools in Norway. I saw there how use of small steps to develop pupil motivation really worked. When you work in other countries and see how things are done you find these little tidbits to share with colleagues and work on. It's the beauty of working internationally.</p> <p>Poverty is a huge issue for me and it's something I've focused throughout my career. Just before I got my current job I worked in the National Strategies for the DCSF focusing on inclusion and outcomes for young people from poor backgrounds. I'm extremely worried about the pupil premium which sounds good on paper but when everything is taken into account, for example less central support, it actually works out as less money for poor children. It seems our new coalition government has a lack of desire to use best practice from the labour government which is really unhelpful.</p> <p>One thing working and researching in other countries has taught me is you can't export an idea without thinking about contextual deprivation and social/economic gaps. For example we think of Norway as being more equal because it's a wealthy society. But it's terrible to be poor in Norway. If the poverty is hidden those people are not going to get support that they need. They're not getting free school meals, they go under the radar. You have to take each school, each pupil and help accordingly. You would spend a pupil premium differently in Australia to how you'd spend it in Reading. That's why pupil data is so important.</p> <p>You have to recognise the differences in countries, that's what working internationally teaches you. The idea that what works in Finland will work in the UK is laughable. The idea you can take one solution and follow it without critique is never going to work. Poverty is like sunshine, it's different in different parts of the world, in different part of the country. There are certain truisms that apply all over such as the link between self efficacy and success. And that's particularly true from children from less wealthy backgrounds. Some things are always true but how you apply that is key. That's something Mr Gove hasn't quite got his head around yet.</p> <p>A better idea is for the teaching workforce to be allowed to reflect on their practice and their pupils and from what I've seen I don't think Ofsted is going to be the one to help teachers do this.</p> <p>I'm now principal at <a href=\"http://www.trinity-school.org.uk/\">Trinity Catholic School</a> in Leamington. I'm a devout Catholic but have never taught in a Catholic School so it's a wonderful opportunity. We've just had our most successful GCSE and A-level results and it's such an exciting time for the school. It's funny though, I can remember driving with my friends from teacher training college after doing a teaching pracs in a really tough school <a href=\"http://bremershs.eq.edu.au/wcms/\">Bremer State High School</a> in Ipswich, Australia. In the second week we all agreed how much we loved it, how much we loved the classroom. I remember saying I'd never want to be headteacher, what an awful, awful job it was all those boring meetings, not being in classroom. But now I'm here doing it - and loving it.</p> <p>I think teaching is a vocation for anyone who genuinely loves teaching. If you feel alive and have a sense of belonging when you stand in front of a class of 30 children then never stop.</p> <p><em>Chris Gabbett is principal of <a href=\"http://www.trinity-school.org.uk/\">Trinity Catholic School</a> in Leamington.
