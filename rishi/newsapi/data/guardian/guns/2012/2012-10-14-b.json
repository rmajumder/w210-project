  "<p>Scots will on Monday be given 100 weeks to make the \"most important political decision in 300 years\" of Scottish history when David Cameron and Alex Salmond sign a deal to stage a legally watertight referendum on independence.</p> <p>In a move that could herald the biggest shakeup in the UK since Irish independence in the 1920s, the prime minister will fly to Edinburgh to settle the terms of a one-question referendum to decide Scotland's future in 2014.</p> <p>The announcement, dubbed the Edinburgh agreement by Salmond's officials, was hailed by the Scotland secretary, Michael Moore, as the biggest political decision in 300 years \u2013 a reference to the two Acts of Union that bound the kingdoms of England and Scotland in 1707.</p> <p>Westminster and Holyrood, described by the prime minister as \"Scotland's two governments\", have both given ground to allow for a 35-clause deal that will give the Scottish parliament the power to hold the referendum, probably in the autumn of 2014.</p> <p>Salmond, the Scottish first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has abandoned his unofficial campaign to add a second \"devo max\" question \u2013 a form of enhanced devolution that stops short of independence \u2013 after failing to win support for it in Scotland. The UK government has given ground by allowing the referendum to be held in 2014 \u2013 London had originally favoured next year \u2013 and not blocking Salmond from allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote.</p> <p>Salmond, whose emphatic victory in the 2011 Scottish parliament elections paved the way for a referendum, said the agreement would allow the vote to be \"made in Scotland\". The first minister said: \"The agreement I expect to reach with the prime minister is one which ensures that not only is the referendum made in Scotland, but that the fundamental right of the people of Scotland to choose their own future is respected by all.</p> <p>\"The agreement will see Scotland take an important step toward independence, and the means to create a fairer and more prosperous Scotland. I look forward to working positively for a yes vote in&#xa0;2014.\"</p> <p>Cameron, who is expected to emphasise Scotland and England's shared military history during his brief visit to Edinburgh on Monday, highlighted the UK government's continued say in Scottish affairs by saying Scotland's \"two governments\" had reached this historic deal. Cameron then mimicked Salmond's rhetoric by claiming the deal had delivered \"the people's referendum\".</p> <p>\"Scotland's two governments have come together to deliver a referendum which will be legal, fair and decisive. This marks the beginning of an important chapter in Scotland's story and allows the real debate to begin. It paves the way so that the biggest question of all can be settled: a separate Scotland or a United Kingdom? I will be making a very positive argument for our United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>The leaders of \"Scotland's two governments\" will take part in an orchestrated event at St Andrew's House, the headquarters of the Scottish government in Edinburgh. They will sign the agreement with Moore and Nicola Sturgeon, the deputy first minister, who have negotiated the deal.</p> <p>But Cameron will not hold a joint press conference with Salmond amid fears in London that the first minister will try to use his moment in the limelight to embarrass Cameron. \"The first minister wants to attract as much attention as possible,\" one UK government source said. \"We just want to bomb him with reasonableness.\"</p> <p>Under the deal, MPs at Westminster will temporarily give the Scottish parliament the legal authority to hold the referendum, overseen by the UK Electoral Commission, but with a sunset clause which removes that power at the end of 2014. UK government sources said they were not prepared to allow Salmond to postpone the referendum if opinion polls suggested he would lose.</p> <p>Under UK referendum legislation which is policed by the commission, Holyrood will be allowed to extend the vote to 16 and 17 year olds for the first time in a major vote in the UK. The Scottish parliament has already allowed them to vote in health board and crofting elections.</p> <p>There are growing signs that Salmond's government will clash with the commission over campaign spending limits. A deal allowing Holyrood to set those limits was one of the final issues to be settled last week, but Salmond and the commission are at odds on how much can be spent.</p> <p>His ministers fear the commission's proposal to allow all registered parties to spend up to \u00a31.5m in total during the last 16 weeks of the campaign, in addition to separate spending by each official referendum campaign based on their vote at the last Scottish elections, will give the three pro-UK parties of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems a significant advantage.</p> <p>Despite being given \u00a32m in donations towards independence, Salmond wants to limit spending by each of the parties to \u00a3250,000 in the final four months of the campaign, with the official yes and no campaigns limited to \u00a3750,000 each.</p> <p>Both sides claim they have achieved their main goals in the talks, but the honours are divided.</p> <p>Salmond has been forced to accept only a single \u2013 yes or no \u2013 question on Scottish independence and to agree to appoint the Electoral Commission to judge the fairness of the question, and to police spending and voting rules \u2013 a measure he heavily resisted last year.</p> <p>Attempts by the first minister behind the scenes to build a powerful coalition between business leaders and civic organisations to add an electorally popular second option to the referendum, for much greater powers for the Scottish parliament within the UK, failed because it lacked support. Salmond wanted the \"devolution plus\" option added to the referendum in case he lost on the independence vote.</p> <p>The latest opinion polls suggest support for independence is sliding: a TNS BMRB poll last week said there is now a 25-point gap between support for remaining in and leaving the UK. Senior SNP sources admit their private polling too shows that staying in the UK is currently more popular.</p> <p>Along with giving way on votes for 16- and 17-year-olds, Cameron has conceded that the poll will be held at a time of Salmond's choosing: autumn 2014 rather than next year, his original preference.</p> <p>Alastair Darling, the former Labour chancellor, who now leads the pro-UK Better Together campaign, said he would have preferred the vote to be in autumn 2013, and objected to extending the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds as a one-off, rather than as a permanent measure. Salmond wants the vote in 2014 largely because Scotland is hosting several high-profile cultural and sporting events that year.</p> <p>Salmond also believes the UK government's spending cuts will be so unpopular by then, and the Tory-Lib Dem coalition so divided, it will strengthen Scottish support for independence.</p> <p>Salmond will host a second \"year of homecoming\" and a clan gathering for expatriate Scots as the country marks the 700th anniversary of the famous Scottish victory over the English as the Battle of Bannockburn. In the summer of 2014, Scotland will host the Commonwealth games and the Ryder Cup golf competition between Europe and the US.</p>",
  "<p>Cabinet Office proposals to expand the use of secret courts will create a \"secret justice system straight from the pages of a Kafka novel\", an Amnesty International report will warn on Monday.</p> <p>The report claims that proposals to extend the use of secret evidence will enable the government to \"simply play the 'national security' card whenever it wants to keep things secret\".</p> <p>The civil liberties organisation is calling on the coalition government to abandon its justice and security bill, which introduces so-called 'closed material procedures' (CMPs) into the main civil courts in England and Wales.</p> <p>The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-the-essential-guide\" title=\"\"> procedures \u2013 already used in security tribunals \u2013 allow sensitive intelligence to be presented to a judge by officials</a> while preventing victims, or claimants, from knowing the allegations against them in full. No date has been set for the bill's next stage in the House of Lords when peers will vote on the controversial measures.</p> <p>Labour, which says it remains \"unconvinced\" of the need for reform, is asking for extra time to be made available for debate, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>Amnesty's report, Left in the Dark: the use of secret evidence in the UK, estimates that CMPs are already used in 21 different legal contexts \u2013 including appeals against the imposition of highly restrictive Terrorist Prevention and Investigation Measures [the successor to control orders], and national security deportation proceedings at SIAC, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission.</p> <p>It poses \"a real threat to the principles of fairness and open justice in the UK\", Alice Wyss of Amnesty said.</p> <p>\"It's already bad enough that secret procedures have been allowed to creep into the justice system but the government is now trying to extend secret justice to an unprecedented degree.\"</p> <p>The report includes interviews with a number of those who have experienced secret justice and still cannot be named. G, a 43-year-old who has been subject to detention under threat of deportation to Algeria over a 10-year period, said: \"I want justice: the opportunity to defend myself, in a fair trial \u2026 I am not even allowed to know the evidence the state claims to have against me.\"</p> <p>Another man, known only as BB, who has been before SIAC, said: \"The case against me? It's just a glimpse I've seen. I've never seen enough things for me to explain anything. The closed hearings, I can't go in, my lawyer can't go in.\"</p> <p>The Amnesty study concludes that relying \"on secret evidence presented to a judge behind closed doors, [runs]&#xa0;\u2026 directly counter to ordinary principles of fairness long-recognised in UK law and fundamental to international human rights standards.</p> <p>\"For people caught up in these secret procedures the consequences can be profound, from being deprived of their liberty, to being separated from their family to be returned to a country where they are at real risk of serious human rights violations&#xa0;\u2026 Despite the serious consequences at stake, closed material procedures make it incredibly difficult for individuals faced with the secret evidence to effectively respond to the government's case.</p> <p>\"Closed material procedures inevitably fail to properly respect principles of open and adversarial justice&#xa0;\u2026 If the justice and security bill becomes legislation in its current form it risks normalising a procedure which can result in violations of the right to a fair trial and the right to effective remedy for victims of human rights violations.\"</p> <p>The government argues that the use of secret courts will not result in any cases currently heard in open session going behind closed doors and enable national security disputes that are at present settled to be contested in court.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \"The point Amnesty have missed is that currently no one, not the claimant, not their lawyers, nor the judge, can take into account or rely on national security-sensitive evidence.</p> <p>\"The result is that cases collapse and we never get to the bottom of serious allegations made against the state.</p> <p>\"The justice and security bill will fix this problem by allowing the national security evidence which is excluded under current rules to be heard in a closed procedure.</p> <p>\"Closed justice is never ideal but it is better when the alternative is silence.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UK drug policy commission's case for decriminalisation rests on the evidence of the limited deterrent effect of Britain's 40-year-old drug law, with an estimated 3 million people having used an illicit drug in the past year.</p> <p>Its report says that since 1971's Misuse of Drugs Act came in the nature of drug use in Britain has changed radically and the legislation was never designed to deal with such high levels of use nor the rapid development of new drugs.</p> <p>Under this legislation more than 160,000 people a year are being given cannabis warnings and a further 42,000 in England and Wales sentenced for possessing drugs. Enforcement focuses particularly on the young and some ethnic groups in particular areas, with more than half of all police stop-and-search activity aimed at finding small amounts of drugs.</p> <p>The scientists and drug experts say the risk of being caught possessing drugs is very low compared with the prevalence of drug use overall and the point has now been reached where the drug laws are largely seen as an irrelevance by those who break them.</p> <p>\"Opponents of depenalisation and decriminalisation raise concerns about the message that a change in the law would send the public, particularly young people. We recognise that the law expresses the sort of society we wish to live in. But the law relating to the possession of drugs has become discredited to such an extent that any usefulness in setting a moral position has in many situations become largely ineffectual,\" the report says.</p> <p>It argues that the \"roof has not fallen in\" across parts of Australia, the US, Portugal, the Czech Republic and some South American countries which have gradually moved towards a more decriminalised approach to personal possession. \"Prevalence and consumption have not increased in these countries to any significant extent. Some experts indeed argue that these reforms have led to decreasing problems.\"</p> <p>The fresh approach advocated by the commission says the first step should be to scrap existing criminal sanctions for possession of small amounts of cannabis.</p> <p>It suggests imposing simple civil penalties, such as a fine, a referral to a drug awareness session similar to the speed awareness courses motorists now face, or to a drug treatment programme if needed.</p> <p>It says that the move should start with cannabis because of its relatively low level of harm, its wide usage and international developments.</p> <p>\"This is something which has been gathering momentum in other countries. If evaluations indicated that there were no substantial negative consequences, similar incremental measures could be considered, with caution and careful further evaluation, for other drugs,\" the report says.</p> <p>\"These changes could potentially result in less demand on police and criminal justice time and resources. Given the experience of other countries, our assessment is that we do not believe this would materially alter prevalence levels, while allowing resources to be spent on more cost-effective measures to reduce the harms associated with drug use. We would expect the net effect to be positive.\"</p> <p>The report recommends that those who grow a small number of cannabis plants should face no or only minimal sanctions, but the experts decisively reject any wider moves to legalisation.</p> <p>They say: \"We do not believe there is sufficient evidence to support the case for removing criminal penalties for the major production or supply offences for most drugs. One of the lessons from the tobacco and alcohol markets is that commercialisation can lead to some disastrous consequences for the wellbeing of the public.\" The report warns that any move to a carefully regulated commercial market for all drugs could lead to \"some hugely negative unintended consequences, and should be treated with caution\".</p> <p>The commission also advocates major changes in the legislative approach to drugs policy. The experts say an independent body, which could be accountable to parliament, needs to be given the power to take decisions about controlling and classifying the harms and risks involved in new drugs.</p> <p>There also needs to be a new independent body to research evidence and analyse the effectiveness of drugs policy. These two bodies could replace the home secretary's current advisory council on the misuse of drugs.</p> <p>The report argues that these changes are unlikely without forging a new cross-party consensus, which could be facilitated by moving responsibility for drugs policy from the Home Office to the Department of Health.</p> <p>But the experts conclude that the most valuable legacy would be a change in British drug policy's relationship with evidence.</p> <p>\"A commitment to the use of evidence to inform which policies are adopted, combined with rigorous trials of new and existing policies, and a willingness to act on the results of this research, would go a long way towards ensuring that the UK has an effective and good value response to the use of mind-altering drugs,\" the 173-page report concludes.</p>",
  "<p>It is rarely said, but there are some things to celebrate about how the UK tackles the problems caused by drug use. Since the 1980s, our progressive policy of providing needle exchanges for injecting drug users has kept their HIV rates at among the lowest in the world. More recently, the expansion of treatment for those with drug problems has helped tens of thousands to rebuild their lives. We are also a decade into a steady decline in the numbers of people who use drugs and who develop drug problems.</p> <p>But this decline in drug use is part of an international trend that may have nothing to do with specific policies in the UK. And although we do some things well, we have become complacent about other parts of drug policy: we are not paying nearly enough attention to how we could do these other things better.</p> <p>Despite the successes of recent years, there are still approximately 2,000 <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health3/deaths-related-to-drug-poisoning/2011/stb-deaths-related-to-drug-poisoning-2011.html\" title=\"\">drug-related deaths in the UK</a> <a href=\"http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/press/news2012/drug-related-deaths-2011.html\" title=\"\">every year</a>. Nearly 400,000 people have serious drug problems and the annual cost to society is estimated to be about \u00a315bn.</p> <p>Politicians are well aware of these problems. A poll of 150 MPs this year found that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/08/mps-drugs-policies-not-working\" title=\"\">77% thought the UK's drug policies were not effective</a>. Public opinion polling shows similar disquiet. Yet few high-profile politicians have been willing to suggest alternatives. It has generally only been the \"formers\" \u2013 those who have left senior posts in government, civil service or the police \u2013 that have argued publicly for a different approach.</p> <p>Previous leaders, including Margaret Thatcher, followed the evidence and adopted new policies. Other countries, such as Uruguay, Portugal and Switzerland, are now testing different approaches. Yet there has been little indication that current frontline politicians in the UK are ready to grasp the nettle of change.</p> <p>But there is one reason, above all, why we might now see a change, and that is money. At least \u00a33bn is spent every year in the UK on tackling drug problems. Some of it is well spent and has a strong evidence base, as in drug treatment and recovery services. But much of it is not.</p> <p>There is little or no evidence to support much of current expenditure on law enforcement and education in schools. We spend billions a year without knowing if it does any good. In boom years this was objectionable; now it is unsustainable.</p> <p>I have chaired the independent UK Drug Policy Commission for the past six years and on Monday we publish our final report. In it, we set out our conclusions for where the evidence suggests we can improve lives and save money. This includes reforming our 40-year-old drug laws and changing the way the government classifies drugs, although we do not believe the current evidence justifies legalising supply. Above all, policymakers need to take far more account of the independent and reliable evidence available to them than they do; and, to facilitate this, we need a new statutory body responsible for ensuring that this evidence cannot be ignored.</p> <p>I have had long involvement with drug policy in the UK, including spending 20 years, from 1974, as a member of the government's <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/acmd/\" title=\"\">Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs</a>. After that, I was the chair of the <a href=\"http://www.police-foundation.org.uk/projects/other-independent-inquiries/inquiry-into-the-misuse-of-drugs\" title=\"\">Police Foundation's independent inquiry into our drug laws</a>.</p> <p>Given this experience, one might expect me to be pessimistic about the chances of another report leading to any change of policy. But previous studies that have identified compelling evidence have spurred improvements in drug policy, and now the evidence is increasingly clear that we need a fresh approach.</p> <p>Later this year, the home affairs committee will publish the results of its own year-long drugs inquiry. If that report indicates that politicians are prepared to take evidence more seriously, and if the government responds positively, it may be a signal that there will eventually be further reasons to celebrate successes in UK drug policy.</p>",

Critics say medication is the wrong way to go and that ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is an extreme form of normal behaviour that needs understanding and psychological therapy rather than drugs.</p> <p>But, said biomedical ethicist Dr Ilina Singh from Kings College London, author of the research, nobody has asked the children themselves.</p> <p>Her work, published as a book and an animated film to help inform the debate around the drugs, was funded by the independent <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2012/WTP040447.htm\">Wellcome Trust</a>. It offers insights into the feelings and experiences of children with ADHD and reveals, worryingly, that they are often bullied at school and that doctors do not talk to them about their condition as much as they would like.</p> <p>The drugs, said Singh, are not the only answer \u2013 she would like to see research into meditation and other alternatives for the children \u2013 but \"the assumed harms of stimulant medication were largely not supported by this study,\" she said, although she added: \"This is is no way a blanket endorsement of stimulant drug treatment.\"</p> <p>Children said the drugs gave them a time and space to consider their reaction to things that could make them behave aggressively. \"They said what a great thing it is to have a bully come up to you in the playground and not react impulsively but have a moment to think, 'what do I do next?',\" said Singh.</p> <p>The children also talked about the downsides of medication. A small group felt the person on the drugs was not their authentic self. \"I didn't feel like myself when I was taking the medication,\" was one comment, and \"I was too quiet; it wasn't me.\"</p> <p>\"One of the messages that children have is that they want more treatment options outside of medication, but they aren't available,\" said Singh. \"There are long waiting lists for any kind of behavioural treatments for kids.\" But drugs, she said, are \"absolutely not the only treatment we should be focusing on.\"</p> <p>The Voices (voices on identity, childhood, ethics and stimulants) study involved detailed interviews with 151 children aged 9 to 14 and their families in the UK and the United States. They were from three groups - children diagnosed with ADHD and on medication, children with a diagnosis who were not on drugs and children with no psychiatric diagnosis.</p> <p>In the US, the drugs were most likely to have been prescribed to improve children's school performance by helping their concentration.</p> <p>Ian, a 12 year-old in a lower-middle-class suburb of a major east coast US city, has been on a variety of drugs for ADHD in the last three years. \"I forget things a lot and I have trouble focusing and being mature,\" he told researchers. \"That means I'm not doing my work like I'm supposed to. The last time I felt good about my behavioUr was when I got all Bs and Cs on like my gradecard, except for one D. That was a few weeks ago. My mom freaked out she was so happy. I want to keep doing better.\"</p> <p>UK children were diagnosed because of disruptive or difficult behaviour. Shaun, 11, lives in a large village on the outskirts of a small city in a lower-middle-class neighbourhood where his parents grew up and other family still live. He has been on stimulants for more than two years.</p> <p>\"It's like sometimes I feel really cross with other people and I just want to go lashing, lashing out,\" he said. \"[Other children at school] know they can wind me up easily so they do it again and again and I can't walk away that easy ... if I get punched, I have to fight back. Teachers are not effective. They don't help. In the future I guess I want to be less naughty.\"</p> <p>The research found a lot of stigma attached to ADHD. Children in the US tended not to tell people they were diagnosed. Children in the UK, among whom issues of aggression and anger made it more obvious, often reported they were bullied as a result.</p> <p>\"Their peers will go out of their way to wind up the child they know has difficulty managing their anger or aggression,\" said Singh. US children would make jokes and tease those with ADHD, but actively attempting to make another child lose control was a particularly British thing, the research found.</p> <p>Children reported little meaningful conversation with their doctors and said they did not understand their condition or why they were taking drugs. Check-ups focus on weight and side-effects and there is little discussion of how they are coping with their lives.</p> <p>That needs to change, said Singh. \"Given the ethical concerns that arise from ADHD and stimulant drug treatment, it is imperative that children are able to openly discuss the value of diagnosis and different treatments with a trusted professional,\" she said.</p> <p>\u2022 The subheading on this article was amended on 15 October 2012. The original said children with hyperactivity problems were concerned that doctors did not understand the condition. The research found that the children themselves did not necessarily understand it. The article was also amended to correct a reference to the Wellcome Foundation to the Wellcome Trust.</p>",
  "<p>Sebastian Vettel took the win and with his team-mate, Mark Webber, a Red Bull one-two at the Korean Grand Prix \u2013 a result that moved the German driver six points ahead of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso with four races to go.</p> <p>Such was Red Bull's dominance that, having stretched their legs early, neither driver was troubled for the rest of the race. Not so for McLaren's drivers, who endured a torrid afternoon to squeeze out a point from 10th place. Yet their race had it all too, drama, a triumph of sorts and by the end, for the team's title hopes, disaster.</p> <p>Jenson Button lasted only to turn three before being rudely shunted out by a late-breaking Kamui Kobayashi, who ploughed through Nico Rosberg's Mercedes. It left Lewis Hamilton as McLaren's sole hope to score the constructors' points the team desperately needed to stay in touch with Red Bull. It soon became clear that even this might be too much, as Hamilton complained of a lack of grip and that the car was difficult to control, resulting in much heavier tyre degradation than expected.</p> <p>He had to make three stops, beginning his battle with the leaders and then moving down the grid through Kimi Raikkonnen, Felipe Massa, Nico H\u00fclkenberg, and onwards until he faced the spectre of his replacement at McLaren next year, Sergio P\u00e9rez, looming in his mirrors in the last laps looking to steal that final point.</p> <p>Yet there he was at the end, still fighting against the odds. Hamilton's car had suffered a rear rollbar failure that destroyed its balance and ability to conserve its rubber. It had been a mighty drive that McLaren's team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, acknowledged.</p> <p>\"It was probably the most hard fought for championship point that I can remember in the history of this team. Lewis did a fantastic job. He was incredibly tenacious and heroic,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We did what we could at stops but it must have been horrendous to drive. That was truly remarkable. My instinct was that we would not get to the end of the race because it would eat all the tyres and if we did reach the end we wouldn't be near&#xa0;points.</p> <p>\"I'm bitterly disappointed with the afternoon but I am immensely proud of his job because in those circumstances it is very easy to not fight like he did.\"</p> <p>Hamilton, who had a difficult weekend, with talk in the paddock alleging a deteriorating relationship with McLaren, initially felt only disappointment at the end of his title challenge. \"It is not easy to deal with because I started training in December and every thought and every day I have woken up has been about winning this championship and how I can do it,\" he said.</p> <p>He did agree that it had been worth seeing the race through. \"It was a struggle. Pure struggle,\" he said. \"You try not to lock up or lose any more than you are already losing. I feel pretty good because I remained strong throughout that struggle.\"</p> <p>Button had less time to deal with his car. He took a knock from P\u00e9rez at turn one about which he was blunt although unconcerned that his team-mate next year may be a handful when he lines up alongside him on a regular basis. \"He brakes so late, he misjudged it,\" Button said. \"I haven't seen that a lot with him. I am just as annoyed as I would be about anyone chucking it up the inside.\"</p> <p>The incident put him out of position heading into turn three, where he was hit by Kobayashi. Button branded him an idiot over the team radio and the Japanese driver apologised, saying: \"I feel very sorry for ruining someone else's race and certainly this was not my intention.\"</p> <p>Button was more sanguine later and accepted the apology, while gently referring to the Sauber driver as \"Kobacrashi\". \"We move on,\" Button said. \"We all have incidents, you just have to hope that you learn from it.\"</p> <p>It was a generous response in the circumstances, especially for the team. McLaren are behind Red Bull and Ferrari in the constructors' championship. Trailing the former by 41 points going into this race the gap has more than doubled to 83 and with Ferrari six points ahead, it is a huge blow.</p> <p>Christian Horner, despite the form of his Red Bull cars, was still circumspect about the remaining races. \"None of us are taking anything for granted,\" the team principal said. \"We have only moved ahead of Fernando by six points. I am sure this title will go all the way down to the wire and we are going to need to extract the most we can out of every single weekend.\"</p> <p>No doubt that is McLaren's goal too but no longer to the same purpose \u2013 10th-place finishes, no matter how heroic, do not win championships. \"In motor racing you have some good days and bad days although I can't remember them going much worse than this one,\" Whitmarsh said.</p> <p>He will not admit it yet but, despite all the effort in South Korea, McLaren's fight for both titles is over, barring extraordinary circumstances.</p>",
  "<p>A comet found recently beyond the orbit of Jupiter could well become spectacular late next year and may be a sibling of one of the most celebrated comets of all time.</p> <p>What is formally known as Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) was not at first recognised as a comet when it was spotted as a 19th magnitude object using a small Russian telescope of the International Scientific Optical Network on 21 September. Earlier images have been found stretching back to last year, allowing its orbit to be calculated and showing that it is destined to sweep within 1.2 million km of the Sun's surface at perihelion on 28 November 2013. Some predictions claim that it could rival the full moon in brightness at that time.</p> <p>Its orbit resembles that of Kirch's Comet, the Great Comet of 1680, which hangs over Rotterdam in our illustration from a painting by the Dutch artist Lieve Verschuier. After becoming the first comet to be discovered telescopically, this brightened enough to be glimpsed in broad daylight. Sir Isaac Newton was also to demonstrate that the comet's parabolic orbit was perfect harmony with his law of universal gravitation, promulgated only seven year later in his famous work, the Principia. As a consequence, the comet is also known as Newton's Comet.</p> <p>This is not to say that the comet of 1680 and Comet ISON are the same object since both probably take thousands of years to orbit the Sun. However, it is possible that both are fragments, albeit substantial ones, of a comet that broke apart many thousands of years ago when the heat stress at perihelion became too much.</p> <p>The fact that Comet ISON is seen easily so far from the Sun suggests that it is large enough to survive its solar encounter and that it will not fizzle out as some close-approach comets have done before. That fate is still possible, and the predictions of its appearance that follow can be little more than guesses at this stage.</p> <p>Its path is known accurately, though, and for once observers in the northern hemisphere are well placed to follow it. After passing very close to Mars and Regulus in our eastern predawn sky in mid-October next year, it should brighten to naked eye visibility during November as it dives towards the Sun.</p> <p>Comet ISON lies close to Spica in Virgo on the 18th and near Mercury and Saturn a few days later, with any tail slanting up and to the right in the morning twilight. Following perihelion it reappears in our western evening sky with its tail short at first but growing rapidly, again upwards and to the right. It may still be an impressive sight as it passes closest to the Earth at the safe distance of 64 million km on Boxing Day.</p>",
  "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching the second series of Homeland on Channel 4. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode two \u2013 and if you've seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/07/homeland-season-two-episode-one\" title=\"\">Rebecca Nicholson's episode one blog</a></p> <h2>Beirut is back</h2> <p>What a week! Saul finding Brody's suicide tape was entirely unexpected \u2013 I thought they'd hold on to that season-one loose end for as long as possible, but here we are, only two episodes into the run, and suddenly Homeland feels like it's about to tell a very different story. Now it all depends on Saul. What will he do? What can he do? And how will he draw out the tension over another 10 weeks?</p> <h2>Brody</h2> <p>There were a number of indications that Brody's facade is slipping this week, with his convictions becoming more hazy, less certain. At the party hosted by MA Bombs, his quip to Jess that, in order to help the veterans, they'd have to \"take out\" the whole room, suggested he is becoming less guarded with her, possibly now that she knows he's a Muslim. Jess, however, is becoming enchanted by the benefits of political life: the big houses, the fancy soirees. If Brody's hoping to find an ally in her, he's likely to be disappointed . Even Dana, his co-conspirator, has become friends with Walden Jr. Who will he turn to?</p> <p>At the same time Brody is still so tied to Abu Nazir that in order to move him out of the snipers' sights he risks texting him 'MAY1', from what must be one of the most secure environments in the entire US. Yet when Roya Hammad meets him to express Nazir's gratitude, he insists \"I'm a US congressman \u2026 I'm not your guy.\" I don't think this is a case of Brody covering all bases. I believe him: he doesn't know where he should be. Saul's discovery should force him to make a decision.</p> <h2>Carrie</h2> <p>\"It fucked me up, Saul, being wrong about Brody. It fucked me up. Because I have never been so sure, and so wrong.\" Carrie's plotlines were both heartbreaking and thrilling. The sense of imminent doom began early in the episode, when Fatima Ali, her asset, gave her information on Abu Nazir and asked Carrie to keep her safe. \"I promise, absolutely,\" she replies, having admitted that she could not speak for the CIA only moments before. There were echoes of Lynn Reed, her dead asset in season one; I was pleased that Ali made it out alive.</p> <p>In fact, this week was all about correcting our skewed perceptions of Carrie. She has been made to think she is wrong, and incompetent to boot, and to some extent we are led to believe this, too. Is she making the right call about Abu Nazir, or leading US troops into a trap? It wasn't until Nazir appeared that we knew Saul made the right call in trusting her. But of course he did \u2013 the episode is called Beirut Is Back, but it could have been Carrie Is Back. She slumps on the sofa at the end, once again out of the CIA, once again at home. There's no way she's going to stay there.</p> <h2>Saul</h2> <p>So much now depends on Saul. His dealings with Carrie were fantastic this week. Finding her on the roof, distressed, he doesn't inquire after her wellbeing, but reminds her, practically: \"People might be watching\" and tries to lead her away. He's firm when he needs to be; explains that he stopped visiting because her doctor asked him not to. And ultimately he puts himself on the line by trusting her call about the Nazir meet.</p> <p>So what happens next? How does he expose a US congressman as a terrorist? Would the CIA want that to be in the public domain? What does that do for homeland security? Did Saul suspect Brody all along, or is he just a master of the stoic non-reaction?</p> <h2>Notes and observations</h2> <p>\u2022 Thanks for all the comments last week. There were lots of grumbles about the ad breaks ruining the tension \u2013 I watch a preview without ads but I imagine it must have been worse this time, given the entire episode depended on a slow, steady build.</p> <p>\u2022 There were lots of questions, too, about the improbability of Brody's rapid ascent to office. To some extent we may just have to put that down to dramatic licence, but again, I'd recommend <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOa98P_Mv68\" title=\"\">watching Game Change</a> for a reminder of the absurdities in the US political system.</p> <p>\u2022 Extra thanks to @Sideshowme <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18733447\" title=\"\">for these thoughts</a> on the show's portrayal of Islam.</p> <p>\u2022 Brody wasn't allowed to take his phone into Estes' office for a routine meeting, but he was allowed to take it into perhaps the most secure assembly of officials undertaking a top-secret, high-priority mission? Handy.</p> <p>\u2022 Damian Lewis does sweaty panic like nobody else.</p> <p>\u2022 VP Walden is a foul-mouthed, gung-ho warmongerer, and is perhaps the most obvious villain of the whole piece.</p> <p>\u2022 Saul and Carrie communicated their intel to Estes over Skype? I'd have gone for gchat myself. Or Facebook messaging.</p> <p>\u2022 Why did Carrie have to brave passport control in her wig to get into Beirut, when she was just whisked out on a helicopter?</p> <p>\u2022 Is Captain Mike going to save the day? I rolled my eyes when he appeared with his theories about Walker's death, but at least it looks like he's going to do something other than pine for Jess this series.</p> <p>\u2022 Carrie running back into Fatima's flat was stupid, reckless and endangered the lives of her asset and Saul. The excitement of the chase was even more remarkable given that there was no music to help it along, only footsteps and birdsong. Homeland can be so classy.</p>",
  "<p>Britain will on Monday take steps towards opting out of a series of EU law and order measures in a move designed by the Tories to show that they are living up to their pre-election Eurosceptic pledges.</p> <p>As Michael Gove, the education secretary, became the latest cabinet minister to signal that Britain may have to leave the EU, Theresa May, the home secretary, was preparing a statement to MPs in which she will say that the government is \"minded\" to exercise Britain's right to opt out of scores of EU justice measures.</p> <p>Her statement comes after Vince Cable issued a dire warning of a collapse in the euro. Speaking at the Cheltenham literature festival, the business secretary said the EU would need to take stock if the euro unravels. \"We tend to forget, until we were reminded last week of that Nobel prize, the European project was constructed in order to rescue Europe from extreme nationalism and conflict. There is no automatic guarantee that won't return.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats are digging in their heels on the EU after Nick Clegg blocked May from making a definitive statement of intent on law and order. He wants the decision to be made in the interests of fighting crime and for it not to be used by the Tories to burnish their Eurosceptic credentials. One senior Lib Dem said: \"We will not let Eurosceptic obsessions endanger the safety of the British people. This is not about euro dogma. This is about people's safety.\"</p> <p>May will announce to MPs that the government is \"minded\" to invoke powers secured by Tony Blair during the Lisbon treaty negotiations to opt out of about 140 EU law and order measures. The Tories and Lib Dems agree it is right to do this as justice and home affairs issues will change their status in 2014 when individual national vetoes are ended in this area. But the coalition parties have yet to agree on the second stage of the process secured by Blair \u2013 working out how many areas Britain should opt back into \u2013 because Clegg is playing hardball.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister, who has instructed the Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander to negotiate with Oliver Letwin, is keen for Britain to maintain the European arrest warrant. This was used to apprehend one of the July 2005 bombers.</p> <p>He also supports Europe's Police Intelligence Agency (Europol), which helped uncover the world's largest paedophile network, and the Joint Investigative Team. This allowed British police officers to work in France after the murders of members of a British family in Annecy last month.</p> <p>Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said: \"Cameron, Gove and May should know better than to throw red meat to the rabidly anti-European Tory Right and Ukip. They're indistinguishable and insatiable. It's a gift to criminals across Europe if we throw our toys out of the pram on the European arrest warrant and then try to put them back in again one by one.\"</p> <p>The Lib Dems are citing a letter to Cameron and Clegg, signed by the former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Blair and the former MI5 director Sir Stephen Lander, which called on Britain not to abandon its European partners. The letter says: \"As former members of the British policing, justice and security community, we wish to indicate why we support remaining within those current structures.</p> <p>\"The growth in cross-border criminal activity within Europe is both an inevitable bi-product of the free movement of goods, services, capital and people under the single market, and a serious policing and security challenge. Responding to an increasingly international criminal environment requires modern international legal and policing tools, fast and effective cross-border cooperation, and the ability to raise standards and share best practice with our closest security partners.\"</p> <p>In a rare intervention, the most senior British official in the European commission called last night for a \"sensible debate\". <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FaullJonathan\" title=\"\">Jonathan Faull, director general of internal market services, tweeted</a>: \"On #EU JHA and opt-ins/outs, hope we have sensible debate about European arrest warrant and other measures.\"</p> <p>The row came after Gove briefed the Mail on Sunday that Britain should be prepared to leave the EU if its 26 partners refuse to repatriate powers to Britain when a treaty negotiation is held to change the governance structures of the eurozone.</p> <p>He joins Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson and Oliver Letwin who are calling for Britain to make clear Britain will leave unless it secures a significant repatriation of powers.</p>",
  "<p>The Americans have this sorted. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Are they happy? That's not the point. The pursuit's the thing.</p> <p>David Cameron rates the idea of measuring happiness, and from the Office for National Statistics we learn that, when asked the question, Indians and those of Indian descent in the UK emerge the happiest. They number about 1.4 million \u2013 our largest visible minority \u2013 and on average, they rate life satisfaction as 7.5 out of 10. White Britons and those identifying as Chinese are next with 7.4 out of 10. Black communities are least happy: just 6.7 out of 10.</p> <p>Dr Rami Ranger, much celebrated Indian captain of industry, takes me into his glass-walled office in west London to talk community contentedness. Three reasons, he says: family, family and family. \"The Indian family is the basis of everything. It's about close family units: family values. There is stability. We learn from our parents. We live our dreams through our children.\"</p> <p>It can't be that simple. At root, he says, it is. \"Marriage is very important. We have assisted marriages \u2013 not forced. Some take issue with it, but it works. People are matched in terms of background and education and class and outlook. Fewer marriages break down. When you have your health and your family and work you enjoy, then you can be happy.\"</p> <p>Helps if you're affluent, I tell him. Indians are everywhere on the social scale, but together they have the lowest poverty rate of any ethnic group. And he has wealth and status. His company Sun Mark won four Queen's Awards for Excellence on the trot. \"But I started with nothing,\" he says. \"I owe this country everything.\" His companies have a joint turnover of more than \u00a3152m. He started with \u00a32 in a shed. \"The turning point for us was the expulsion of the Ugandan Asians in 1972,\" he says. \"We were struggling. But they were educated and they had experience of running business. They were role models. We thought: if they can do it, we can too.\"</p> <p>Perhaps we should learn from you, I suggest. That's it, he exclaims. \"Look and copy. Don't blame others. Look to yourselves.\" And who do you copy? \"I look to the Jewish communities,\" he says. \"They have been here longer than us.\" Always something new to learn.</p>",
  "<p>Tragedy, Nietzsche theorised, has two elements, two gods that direct the drama: Dionysus and Apollo. Dionysus is the god of chaos and disorder, sometimes even the god of drunkenness and violence. Apollo is the god of order, calm, clarity and beauty. \"These two very different tendencies walk side by side, usually in violent opposition to one another, inciting one another to ever more powerful births.\" Thus, says Nietzsche, all great art is generated.</p> <p>Dionysus and Apollo \u2013 or, for my purposes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/occupy-london?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Occupy</a> and St Paul's. Their chance meeting a year ago has been characterised by misunderstanding and opposition. Occupy with its earthy populism and Dionysian disdain for formal structures, St Paul's with its elite Apollonian worship of cold marble and ethereal song \u2013 they were destined never to get along. And yesterday's contretemps in the cathedral was a predictable revisiting of the conflict.</p> <p>Nietzsche's idea was that the Dionysians are fundamentally the truth-tellers in the relationship. The world is indeed chaotic and disordered. But this knowledge is so difficult to process, so frightening, we need a structuring lens through which to see it.</p> <p>Apollo cleans things up, makes wonky lines straight, turns chaos into art, so that we might live with disturbing truth without being overwhelmed by it. Apollonian order is how we emotionally manage Dionysian truth.</p> <p>Likewise, when it comes to their analysis of the state of the world, it is Occupy who are basically right. Despite the facade of respectability and ordered control presented by our great financial institutions, modern capitalism \u2013 turbo-charged by absurd levels of borrowing \u2013 is responsible for much of the world's chaos. In the name of freedom and deregulation, financial anarchy has spread from the housing market to the banks and is now being swallowed up as massive sovereign debt which we will now pass on to our children and grandchildren. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis\" title=\"\">euro will probably collapse</a> and millions more people will suffer enormous hardship. More jobs will be lost and houses repossessed.</p> <p>The wealthy will be protected by stored-up money. The poor and the not-so-poor will be exposed to the elements. Back in 1992, Francis Fukuyama spoke of the end of history, as if capitalism had settled all the big arguments. How wrong he was. We are now facing a future of social chaos and public disorder.</p> <p>This is the Dionysian truth named by Occupy. But it is so overwhelming, we don't begin to know how to fix it. And so it goes in the mental box marked \"too difficult to think about\". Perhaps it will go away, we hope. Except it won't. The west is trillions of dollars in debt, over half the planet can barely feed themselves or not at all, and we place our trust in a few percentage points of economic growth, conveniently forgetting that it was too much faith in growth that got us into this mess in the first place.</p> <p>The church ought to have a great deal to say about all of this, and ought to be as angry as the Occupiers, but it is stuck in the position of never wanting to take sides. Traditionally, the Church of England has styled itself as the honest broker, a host organisation that stages debates rather than take part in them. Like the BBC, though completely unlike Jesus himself, it is constantly reaching for a sensible balance, defining its position by charting a mean between extremes. This way it justifies its role as an established church. The problem for the Church of England, and specifically for places like St Paul's, is that this lofty Apollonianism has little to say to angry people other than calm down and (if they won't) go home.</p> <p>Following last year's St Paul's debacle, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a561a4f6-0485-11e1-ac2a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz29ICxVJav\" title=\"\">Rowan Williams claimed</a> that \"the Church of England is still used by British society as a stage on which to conduct by proxy the arguments that society itself does not know how to handle\". But we have to be so much more than a high-class debating society. As the Occupiers reminded the church today, Jesus angrily ejected the moneychangers from the temple. It's hard to imagine circumstances in which the Church of England would ever do the same.</p>",
  "<p>In a week when the extent of Jimmy Savile's alleged abuse of numerous young teenage girls has been revealed (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/12/jimmy-savile-government-civil-claims\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 13 October), it is ironic that Nick Clegg refuses to support the page 3 of the Sun ban. He asserts that for him to do so would be \"deeply illiberal\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/12/clegg-banning-sun-page-3-illiberal\" title=\"\">It's not for MPs to ban page 3 girls, says Clegg</a>, 13 October). I talked with my 11- and 14-year-old daughters this week about the Savile news story. They asked me why the vast majority of perpetrators of sexual abuse of females are male. While acknowledging the many reasons why sexual abuse occurs, I cited page 3 of the Sun as a daily example of our society's objectification of women.</p> <p>It is alleged that Savile abused numerous young girls over several decades. A contributory factor will have been him viewing his victims as objects rather than fellow human beings. Clegg would do well to examine his own refusal to engage in actions that could meaningfully change those aspects of society that provide the conditions for such appalling abuse to occur.<br><strong>Dr Laura Golding</strong><br><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 While I am happy to be, and indeed have just been (successfully) checked for a job by the Criminal Records Bureau, could the pointlessness of this expensive exercise ever be more richly illustrated than by the fact that Jimmy Savile \u2013 unconvicted of any crime \u2013 would have passed a CRB check without the slightest problem? A major and convincing rethink of the CRB is long overdue.<br><strong>David Beake</strong><br><em>Wymondham, Norfolk</em></p> <p>\u2022 A bill currently before parliament will require whistleblowers to satisfy a \"public interest\" test if they are to receive employment protection. Is it possible that a worker with a suspicion about a another person's predatory activities might think that raising this concern could be treated as a private matter and thus refrain from reporting it? Something positive could emerge from the Jimmy Savile saga if the government now accepted that its new \"public interest\" test might inhibit disclosures about serious wrongdoing.<br><strong>Professor David Lewis</strong><br><em>Middlesex University</em></p> <p>\u2022 \"I spoke to a senior officer and I wasn't believed.\" This statement, by a police officer who had been told about one example of Savile's behaviour, was quoted on Radio 4 News. A witness to another occasion said: \"There was nothing I could do.\"</p> <p>This kind of outcome is common for would-be whistleblowers. Even worse was the fate some years ago of the doctor who exposed the needless death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/17/sarahboseley\" title=\"\">infants undergoing surgery in Bristol</a>. He was hounded out of the country.</p> <p>We need a whistleblowers' charter. Of course malicious talebearing must not be accepted, but there should be some way that a witness or a victim could take their concerns to a senior person, perhaps an ombudsman, if their immediate superior doesn't believe them.<br><strong>Alisoun Gardner-Medwin</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 It defies belief that where patients and nurses witnessed assaults and clearly knew his reputation, hospital managers entrusted with care of some of our most vulnerable people \u2013 especially at Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville \u2013 would not also have known and heard. That nobody raised a concern with them over decades, or that senior managers could not have investigated their worries themselves? It defies belief that NHS trusts and managers bleat now about how shocked they are. How could they possibly be shocked given the revelations of the last week, and the exceptional freedom to roam those hospitals which Savile had?</p> <p>The BBC can at least appeal to \"the pop culture of the time\". Hospitals have no such recourse. If allegations widen against places of sanctuary where physically and mentally vulnerable patients literally could not escape a predator, and if financial considerations from fundraising overrode all protective ones, that will be a bigger scandal than the BBC's. If senior heads remain from any such times, I for one hope they begin to roll.<br><strong>Sarah Nelson</strong><br><em>University of Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 Savile: another case of too big to fail?<br><strong>Edward Bick</strong><br><em>Cheltenham</em></p>",
  "<p>British people were half as likely as those in four other countries to cover their mouths more frequently when coughing or sneezing during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, according to <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(12)70206-2/abstract\" title=\"\">a paper in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases</a>. The researchers asked 900 randomly chosen adults in Japan, Mexico, Argentina, the US and the UK about the hygiene habits they used to reduce the spread of H1N1 swine flu. In the UK, a little more than half said they had washed their hands more frequently, compared with nearly 90% of Argentinians. Despite advice to cough or sneeze into our elbows, only a quarter of people in the UK said they did so. In Mexico, it&#xa0;was more than three-quarters.</p> <p>Now that the cold and flu season is coming round again, should we be more hygienic? The World Health Organisation estimates that 80% of all virus infections worldwide are caused by poor hygiene. The biggest concern is inadequate hand washing. So which practices work, and how can you strike a balance between careful and obsessive?</p> <h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2> <p>Most colds and flu are spread by viral droplets in coughs and sneezes or by viral particles being left on a surface, picked up on fingers and introduced into the body through the eyes, mouth or nose. Viruses and bacteria that cause vomiting and diarrhoea are also spread&#xa0;by hands.</p> <p>Keep your hands as germ-free as possible by washing them thoroughly using warm water and soap \u2013 these are more effective than just using sanitised sprays. The <a href=\"http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1194947384669\" title=\"\">technique recommended by the Health Protection Agency</a> involves rubbing palms together, interlocking hands and washing carefully between the fingers for 20 seconds. You should wash your hands at the flimsiest excuse to protect yourself and others, but especially after sneezing or coughing into your hands, going to the toilet, petting a dog, gardening, changing a&#xa0;nappy, preparing uncooked food, handling rubbish and taking care of anyone who is sick. Dry your hands thoroughly or the viruses and bacteria cling on. There is evidence that paper towels get rid of more germs than air hand dryers, but trials are almost all sponsored by industry, with positive results for whoever funded the research.</p> <p>If your child keeps coming home from school with tummy bugs or colds, check they are washing their hands. A&#xa0;survey by <a href=\"http://www.initial.co.uk/news/2012/hand-washing-risk.html\">Initial Hygiene</a> of 50 children in the UK aged seven to 11 found that 40% said they didn't wash their hands with soap after using the toilet, and three-quarters didn't do so before meals.</p> <p>Don't leave used hankies or tissues lying around. If someone in the house has a cold, wash communal surfaces such as door handles with hot soapy water or antibacterial cleaner. Keep your hands away from your mouth, nose and eyes.</p> <p>You also may want to choose kissing over hand shaking as a form of greeting during the winter&#xa0;months (ideally air kissing). Surveys reportedly show that shaking hands transfers germs very effectively.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2012. The original said that 500 children were surveyed by Initial Hygiene, when in fact 50 were.</p>",
  "<p>In response to the justice secretary's intention to get tough (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/09/sexual-offenders-two-strikes-out\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 10 October), as the newly formed Independent Probation Alliance we challenge the assumption that this will reduce crime. It is telling that Chris Grayling's party conference speech did not once mention the probation service, which is responsible for supervising and managing offenders in the community. Still more disturbing is the removal of probation from the minister's title so that now he is responsible for prisons and rehabilitation \u2013 signalling the demise of a key national service?</p> <p>Grayling correctly listed the factors contributing to offending behaviour. An over-focus on punishment, however, creates an unintended consequence \u2013 people tend to continue offending. Real results are obtained from rehabilitation and reintegration. In contrast, a disproportionate emphasis on custodial sentences is both expensive and ineffective, with political rhetoric along such lines doing little to protect the public, while alienating further those in most need of better integration into society, and making the rehabilitation of offenders more difficult.</p> <p>Although unmentioned in Grayling's speech, the probation service faces radical changes that will see key functions privatised and payment by results introduced. These untested departures will effectively remove probation from the public sector, calling into question who has overall accountability for offenders in the community. Given the implications for public safety, we urge the justice secretary to look at the evidence of what works before reaching for doctrinaire solutions.</p> <p><strong>Diana Fulbrook</strong> <em>Chair, Safeguarding Children Board,</em> <strong>Loraine Gelsthorpe</strong> <em>President, British Society of Criminology,</em> <strong>Lord Ramsbotham</strong> <em>Former chief inspector of prisons</em>, <strong>Jane Allen</strong> <em>Director of Harthill Consulting</em>, <strong>Rob Canton</strong> <em>Professor in Community and Criminal Justice, De Montfort University</em>, <strong>Steve Collett</strong> <em>Former CEO, Cheshire Probation, Honorary fellow Liverpool University, Honorary reader, Manchester University</em>, <strong>Ian Glennie</strong> <em>Justice communications consultant</em>, <strong>Carol Hedderman</strong> <em>Professor of criminology, University of Leicester,</em> <strong>Fergus McNeill</strong> <em>Professor of Criminology and social work, University of Glasgow</em>, <strong>Karen Page</strong> <em>Criminal justice consultant,</em> <strong>David Scott</strong> <em>Visiting senior research fellow, University of Portsmouth,</em> <strong>Anne Worrall</strong> <em>Professor of criminology, Keele University</em></p>",
  "<p>If you want an object lesson in humility then I recommend you go out in early morning or evening, when the sun is at a low angle, and examine any length of fencing. Glistening from every link in the chain is a gossamer of spiders' webs. In fact some fences here are so smothered there are actually two structures \u2013 one of galvanised metal but another infinitely finer, continuous tissue of silk. You quickly realise that spiders are everywhere. One estimate suggests 2.5m per hectare. We might well hold the title deeds, but this is not our land. It belongs to spiders.</p> <p>Or, at least it did, because the real era of the spider's web is the cusp of late summer and early autumn. We now live largely amid the ruins of this year's arachnid dynasty, but evidence of its existence, all that dust-laden silk, is still a remarkable phenomenon. My favourite is the orb-web which is made by one of our commonest species, the <a href=\"http://www.buglife.org.uk/discoverbugs/bugofthemonth/Garden+cross+spider\" title=\"\">garden cross spider</a>, itself a glorious gem with sparkling white markings on a background that varies from soft grey-brown right through to brightest conker. Most individual webs of this species that I've counted have around 20 to 25 radials per web with a comparable number of ever\u2011decreasing circles, each one beautifully spliced into the circumference of the last. However, I did find one that had 36 radials and 37 circumferences. It meant that in order to complete her web the spider had linked her silk lines at least 1,332 times. She does it mainly at night, purely by touch, and yet by morning the thing is always the same Platonic model of perfection, gilded by microscopic beads of dew.</p> <p>The earliest spiders arose in the Devonian 400m years ago, so think how old that form is. When you see a spider's web you are looking at a work of art whose design was worked out before our species existed.</p>",

When Pankhurst was recruited earlier this summer, Jacques Rogge was hailing the Games as <a href=\"http://www.ww.w.londonthenews.com/news/Sports/20120727/34062576/IOC-head-London-Olympics-boost-gender-equality.htm\" title=\"\">\"a major boost for gender equality\"</a>, and in the warm Olympics afterglow a mass lobby in protest at the erosion of women's rights had struck some as anachronistic. But since then we have seen the minister for women call for a reduction in the abortion limit to 20 weeks \u2013 and the secretary of state for health propose, apparently off the top of his head, a time limit of just 12 weeks. Suddenly the protest could not feel more timely nor more urgent.</p> <p>\"It shows we can never afford to be complacent about the right to an abortion. It's easy to become complacent, and then suddenly we see these attacks, and it brings home how important it is that we maintain a really strong pro choice movement. We need to speak out openly about our own experiences, because these ministers' statements are creating a hostile environment. One in three women have an abortion in their lifetime. The majority of the UK population support a woman's right to choose. All the main UK medical bodies support the current term limit. So it's just not true that the situation has changed in any way. It shows you that women's bodies are still battlegrounds.\"</p> <p>It is now 45 years since the Abortion Act was passed. Very few young gay or black people or Muslims or disabled people would say that prejudice had been defeated, yet in the 90s it was commonplace for young women to declare sexism dead. Due in large part to Banyard's activism, this is beginning to change, but why does she think so many women had been convinced they had no need for feminism?</p> <p>\"Throughout the 90s and much of the noughties, we were sold a lie on an almighty scale. That equality had been won, that the battle was over, and now was the time to enjoy our rights. I&#xa0;think what really helped contribute to that was how institutions and corporations who rely on sexism, who rely on women's inequality, adapted and changed. And co-opted the language of feminism very, very cleverly. Feminists of previous generations really got these ideals of independence, equality and agency accepted as standards and values society holds dear. So this didn't escape the notice of people like Hugh Hefner, the sex industry, the beauty industry. They knew that to survive they had to adapt. So all of a sudden putting on makeup was a major route to empowerment; visiting or performing in a lapdancing club was evidence of your independence and how sexually liberated you were. The sex industry held itself up as the promised land of feminism. Everything that feminists had been fighting for \u2013 sexual liberation, economic independence, control over their own bodies and so forth. When in fact what they represented was the complete opposite of feminism.</p> <p>\"This neo-liberal ideology of choice being the ultimate test of whether or not something's OK did influence feminism itself, and really threatened to derail the movement. And the consequences are felt by absolutely everyone in society.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397817072\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350064076988/Kat-Banyard-London-Playbo-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kat Banyard London Playboy Club Protests, 2011\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banyard (right) and fellow members of UK Feminista and Object protest against the opening of Playboy London in June 2011.

But the implication of campaigns for tighter regulation of the sex industry, or better conditions for those working within it, might arguably be that it is OK, as long as the women are treated properly. Can&#xa0;there ever be such a thing as an OK&#xa0;sex industry?</p> <p>\"No. There can't. You can't commodify consent. The inherent harm at the heart of this transaction we see evidenced in the astronomical rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, which is a result of having repeated unwanted sex because you need the money. It's often argued that it's just like stacking shelves. That it is ordinary work, just like any other work. But if you're stacking shelves, is it a bit different if your manager says: 'Right, before you go at the end of your shift can you give me a blowjob?' Would you feel uncomfortable about that? It's the inherent harm of having repeated unwanted sex which lies at the heart of the problem.\"</p> <p>Banyard regards the sex industry's male consumers as victims too. \"I&#xa0;think their sexuality has been co-opted by a predatory sex industry, which distorts and exploits it for profit. A new generation of boys, the vast majority have watched hardcore pornography on the internet, so we have a generation of boys coming through whose first sexual experiences will be vicariously participating in prostitution. They are watching filmed prostitution and getting their ideas about sex from it. This is an industry dedicated to finding ways of getting men to come back and keep coming back for more, so it tends to be increasingly violent to keep upping that response.\"</p> <p>Another way of looking at it would be less charitable. Offered limitless choice, it turns out that what men really want is the most violent, degrading, misogynist porn imaginable. Does that tell us something about men?</p> <p>\"Well, increasingly we are seeing men who are speaking out about it.\" I begin to see how deftly Banyard has learned to sidestep old accusations like man-hating which have tangled up so much past feminist thinking. \"One young man, a friend, set up the <a href=\"http://www.antipornmen.org/\" title=\"\">Anti Porn Men Project</a> because he was using pornography at university, as all of his mates did, and suddenly started to become very conscious of how it was filtering into his everyday life \u2013 the way he looked at women, the way he thought about sex, and this really started to jar with his notions of equality. I think that's the only way we'll start to move forward, if more and more men do actually stand up publicly and say this is exploitative, and a man's sexuality should not be based on the exploitation of a woman, and we need to take our notions of sexuality back from these predatory pornographers.\"</p> <p>Everyone who has ever campaigned against pornography comes up against the same problem. If they want to stop people using porn, they must want censorship \u2013 and what kind of liberation movement calls for state control of individual liberty?</p> <p>\"In terms of what we do about it, I&#xa0;don't think there are simple answers.\" At first this sounds like a bit of a cop-out, until Banyard points out that our choice need not necessarily come down to a pornographic free-for-all versus nanny state censorship; we just haven't yet had the resources to develop other possibilities. \"For me it's really important just to open up that conversation. The organisations that work on this are hugely underfunded, so the ability to conduct research, to provide a forum to develop policy, has been severely restricted. People see it as an inevitable aspect of our life that commercial sex is now firmly embedded in society, and the point is there's an alternative. It's not inevitable. As a society we can choose whether or not it exists.\"</p> <p>Post-feminists became a lot more relaxed about pornography when <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159206/\" title=\"\">Sex and the City</a>, widely celebrated as porn for women, came along. Now we're all enjoying it equally, the argument went, the problem's solved. Banyard offers a witheringly dry smile. \"Well, equality of oppression is never a great strategy for&#xa0;liberation.\"</p> <p>A similar argument is often made these days about the beauty industry. With more and more men getting waxed and manicured, surgically enhanced and elaborately styled, why are feminists still so bothered about body image?</p> <p>\"But if you look at the statistics of who is and isn't getting surgery it is 90% women who are having their flesh cut, tucked, pulled, to fit the beauty ideal. Cosmetic surgery fundamentally is about businesses trying to convince people to get unnecessary, invasive, very risky surgery. They know as well as everyone else does that women hate their bodies on a massive scale, and the solution they offer is the knife; they don't say, actually, we need to change the culture which is fuelling the self-hate and making women feel like this. They say, cut up your body to fit the culture.\"</p> <p>Some feminists think the solution to a beauty industry that makes women hate their bodies is more diversity. If all sorts of different shapes and sizes appeared in adverts and the media, women would soon stop feeling inadequate \u2013 a theory allegedly proven by the sensational success of a <a href=\"http://www.dove.us/Social-Mission/campaign-for-real-beauty.aspx\" title=\"\">Dove ad campaign</a> featuring \"ordinary\" women. \"But it's still this notion that beauty is fundamental to women's identity,\" Banyard says. \"It's still about objectification and commodification. And the product itself they were selling\" \u2013 a body lotion promising to firm up wobbly flesh \u2013 \"kind of undermined their claims.\"</p> <p>Susie Orbach's <a href=\"http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/481078/\" title=\"\">public endorsement</a> of the Dove campaign suggested to me tactical feminist pragmatism. To challenge an entire culture of objectification is monumentally ambitious; to make it slightly less damaging is more doable. But it runs the risk of validating the very thing you wish did not exist, so I ask where Banyard sits on pragmatism versus principle. After a long pause and a short, uneasy laugh, she says: \"Fundamentally, everybody wants change, and I'm not going to sit here and judge other people's efforts. I do think we need a broad range of approaches to these issues.\"</p> <p>I think she's avoiding saying anything that could be misconstrued as a feminist slagging match. \"No, not at all. In my book I wrote that I'm seriously troubled by Dove. I think it just shows you the lack of work that's going on to tackle this. It's been completely sidelined as an issue; we don't hear many politicians battling it out on who's going to best tackle the harmful cultures which make young girls feel like they're objects. \"I went to a recent event to celebrate efforts to promote better body image, a series of awards, and who got up but businessman after businessman after businessman. For me that's not what a feminist revolution looks like.\"</p> <p>Another perennial feminist dilemma is the tension between personal choice and duty to principle. Every woman who gets breast implants can't help but reinforce the message that it's perfectly normal and sensible to spend thousands of pounds being cut open and stuffed with fake breasts. I ask if she thinks feminists who do so are letting other women down.</p> <p>\"It doesn't work like that,\" she says very firmly. \"Not at all. The whole point is that feminism is about tackling the cultures that led women to feel like they didn't look good enough in the first place. I don't believe anyone has the right to judge another woman for the choices she makes in a highly sexist culture. Women have to find ways to survive and get by each day, and how we do that will depend upon our circumstances. I think judging other women on that basis is the antithesis of what feminism is about. And we need to have our sights set on the structures and the industries which feed this culture, who are the ones driving it and reaping the profits from it.\"</p> <p>I don't think I've ever met a high-profile activist so lacking in any discernible trace of ego. I've certainly never seen an interviewee approach the photoshoot with greater dread. The modesty makes her a somewhat guarded interviewee \u2013 she doesn't like to talk about her private or family life at all \u2013 but her achievements are all the more remarkable for it. UK Feminista is galvanising feminist campaigns across the country, training more new recruits in the art of activism.</p> <p>One critic who reviewed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/21/the-equality-illusion-kat-banyard\" title=\"\">her book</a> complained that Banyard just didn't sound angry enough to stand a chance of making much impact. I wondered if that had made her angry, but she just shrugs. \"Yeah, the very notion of anger crops up again and again in feminist discussions; either you're too angry, or you're not angry enough. If you're angry, you're irrational; if you're not angry, you don't care enough.\" She pauses and smiles. \"But I've always found feminism incredibly inspiring.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 October 2012.

  "<p>What were you doing before you started reading this? Were you&#xa0;fully focused on another article? Or doing the crossword? Eating breakfast? Organising your day? Or were you staring out of the window, feeling restless and bored?</p> <p>It is more likely to have been the latter. Fleeting moments of boredom are universal, and are often what drives us to stop what we are doing and shift to something that we hope will be more stimulating.</p> <p>But although boredom is common, it is neither trivial nor benign, according to Dr John Eastwood, a&#xa0;psychologist at York University, Toronto. Eastwood is the joint author of <a href=\"http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/5/482.abstract\" title=\"\">The Unengaged Mind</a>, a major new paper on the theory of boredom.</p> <p>Boredom, he points out, has been associated with increased drug and alcohol abuse, overeating, depression and anxiety, and an increased risk of making mistakes. Mistakes at work might not be a matter of life and death for most of us, but if you are an air traffic controller, pilot or nuclear power&#xa0;plant operator, they most certainly can be.</p> <p>Commercial pilot Sami Franks (not his real name) confirms that boredom can make pilots lose attention. \"When you fly long haul, there are two pilots, one of whom is monitoring all the screens while the other does the paperwork, talks to air traffic control and so on. You need to be alert for landing and takeoff, but once you're 500ft above the runway, the plane's on&#xa0;autopilot and it can be very quiet and boring.</p> <p>\"In a study I saw of co-pilots who woke up after a nap, 30% reported seeing the other pilot asleep too,\" adds Franks, in a comment that will not play well with nervous flyers.</p> <p>The stakes are not usually so high, but boredom can be protracted, heavy and associated with an unpleasant sensation, according to Eastwood. And&#xa0;despite having attracted the attention of philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists and educationalists, there is no precise definition of boredom and no consensus as to how we counter it. The report says boredom is most often&#xa0;conceptualised as \"the&#xa0;aversive experience of wanting, but being unable, to engage in satisfying activity.\"</p> <p>\"All instances of boredom involve a failure of attention,\" says Eastwood. \"And attention is what you are using now to blot out the plethora of stimuli around you while you focus awareness on a given topic.\"</p> <p>There are three functions involved in attention. We have to be suitably aroused, so as not to fall asleep on the job. Then we have an orienting system that can cut in so that if you cross the road, deep in thought, you will still respond to a flickering light on the edge of your visual field that heralds a&#xa0;fast-approaching car. And the third type of attention is an executive system that oversees our mental activities, so we can consciously stay engaged even if the task is not very interesting. Boredom results when any of these functions breaks down.</p> <p>Dr <a href=\"http://www.uea.ac.uk/edu/People/Academic/epriyadharshini\" title=\"\">Esther Priyadharshini</a>, a senior lecturer in education at the University of East Anglia, has studied boredom and says it can be seen in a positive light. \"We can't avoid boredom \u2013 it's an&#xa0;inevitable human emotion. We have&#xa0;to accept it as legitimate and find ways it can be harnessed. We all need downtime, away from the constant bombardment of stimulation. There's no need to be in a frenzy of activity at all times,\" she says.</p> <p>Children who complain that they have nothing to do on rainy half-term breaks may find other things to focus on if left to their own devices. The artist Grayson Perry has reportedly spoken of how long periods of boredom in childhood may have enhanced his creativity. \"We all need vacant time to mull things over,\" says Priyadharshini.</p> <p>But if boredom can enhance our creativity and be a signal for change, why is it such a corrosive problem for some individuals?</p> <p>People who have suffered extreme trauma are more likely to report boredom than those who have had a less eventful time. The theory is that they shut down emotionally and find it&#xa0;harder to work out what they need. They may be left with free-floating desire, without knowing what to pin it&#xa0;on. This lack of emotional awareness is known as alexithymia and can affect&#xa0;anyone.</p> <p>Frustrated dreamers who haven't realised their goals can expend all their&#xa0;emotional energy on hating themselves or the world, and find they have no attention left for anything else. Bungee jumpers and thrill-seekers may also be particularly susceptible to boredom, as they feel the world isn't moving fast enough for them. They constantly need to top up their high levels of arousal and are always searching for stimulation from their&#xa0;environment.</p> <p>\"Boredom isn't a nice feeling, so we have an urge to eradicate it and cope with it in a counterproductive way,\" says Eastwood. This may be what drives people to destructive behaviours such as gambling, overeating, alcohol and drug abuse, he says, though research is&#xa0;needed to tease out whether there's a direct causal link.</p> <p>\"The problem is we've become passive recipients of stimulation,\" says Eastwood. \"We say, 'I'm bored, so I'll put on the TV or go to a loud movie.' But boredom is like quicksand: the more we thrash around, the quicker we'll sink.\"</p>",

  "<p>Five days before Frankel's final run is a good time for a reality check. The superstar colt, officially the best in the world, remains unbeaten in 13 career starts and the high-street bookmakers will offer no bigger than 1-7 that he keeps his record intact in the Champion Stakes at Ascot on Saturday.</p> <p>The sell-out crowd of 32,000 will, for the most part, take victory for granted and will be more interested in seeing the horse than the race, even though Cirrus Des Aigles and Nathaniel are expected to line up against him. But here comes Phil Smith, British racing's senior handicapper, to disabuse everyone of their idle faith.</p> <p>\"This is undoubtedly his stiffest test to date,\" Smith said on Sunday. \"There's no question that these are the best two horses he has taken on and he's got it all to do.</p> <p>\"On soft or heavy going Cirrus Des Aigles is a serious horse. We don't yet know that about Frankel because he hasn't raced on the type of ground we have seen over the past week.\"</p> <p>The going at Ascot is soft all round after 5mm of rain on Saturday and Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, holds out little reason to hope for anything different by the weekend. Showers are forecast for every day and, although the volume is hard to predict, Stickels feels there is a \"strong possibility\" of soft going when the Champion Stakes is run. It should be no worse than that; Ascot has staged Flat racing on heavy only twice in seven years.</p> <p>Will Frankel get through the mud? His connections seem sanguine about soft and point out that he has raced on it once before, when holding off Nathaniel by half a length on his debut in 2010. They may withdraw him if the going turns heavy.</p> <p>\"I don't see why he wouldn't cope with it,\" Smith said. \"The thing about soft ground is that it inconveniences some horses, so he might win but whether he can produce the level of performance we've seen from him I don't know.\"</p> <p>That matters because, for all Frankel's many impressive displays, Smith is still waiting for the colt to do something so dramatic as to make him the best horse in the recent history of the official ratings. To this point Frankel has achieved a mark of 140, putting him just behind Dancing Brave, who carried the same colours of Khalid Abdulla and scored 141 in 1986.</p> <p>It is a source of some chagrin to Smith, whose personal feeling is that Frankel really is the best Flat racehorse of his lifetime. \"But it's difficult, at the moment, to prove it with the figures.\"</p> <p>Frankel will be weighed in the balance for the final time in Hong Kong in December, when the world's senior handicappers meet to agree on definitive figures for this year's runners. His rating could go up at that stage but it could also go down. Bathos is the fear. Most racing fans feel Frankel deserves a better epitaph than \"the second-best horse since 1985\".</p> <p>It is \"hugely difficult\" to make comparisons, Smith says, not least because handicapping has changed in personnel and in method over the past quarter-century. But the main problem is that Frankel has not faced the same quality of opposition that Dancing Brave pushed aside when winning his Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.</p> <p>\"There's no question that Dancing Brave ran against better horses than Frankel has met but then he never hammered them in the way that Frankel has. He gave them a start and ran past them.</p> <p>\"That's the difference between these two. One has beaten good horses by a mile, the other beat very good horses by not so far.\"</p> <p>Now, in Cirrus Des Aigles and Nathaniel, Frankel faces worthy rivals, though Smith indicates he might still need to beat them by five lengths to get to 141. Does the handicapper regret that Frankel has never been sent abroad in search of greater challenges, as Dancing Brave was?</p> <p>\"No, I want him to run in Britain. This race is shaping up to be the best race in the world this year and that's what I want British racing to have. So let's hope the three of them all turn up in good shape and we'll see what happens.\"</p> <p>On Sunday night the Chantilly-based trainer of Cirrus Des Aigles, Corine Barande-Barbe, confirmed that her horse was still on course for the Champion Stakes, having recovered well from his easy win at Longchamp the previous weekend. The two-week gap is not a concern for her, the gelding having won last year's Champion after taking part in the same prep-race.</p> <p>\"He's very well, he returned well from his race,\" she said. \"I hear it's raining there but we don't mind that. Some other horses do mind.\"</p> <p>Speaking at Newmarket on Saturday evening, John Gosden said of Nathaniel: \"He worked here this morning and he worked nicely, so \u2026 one day at a time. Intended runner at this stage.\"</p> <p>Asked if really deep ground might put him off, he replied: \"No, I don't think so. It's autumn, you accept autumn ground. We'll probably get on and run him if he's in good order.</p> <p>\"It's great, they [Frankel and Nathaniel] had their first race together and, after this, they're both retiring to stud, so it's two bookends.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bovine tuberculosis is a serious problem for UK farmers, deserving the highest standard of evidence-based management. The government's TB-control policy for England includes licensing farmers to cull badgers. As scientists with expertise in managing wildlife and wildlife diseases, we believe the complexities of TB transmission mean that licensed culling risks increasing cattle TB rather than reducing it.</p> <p>Even if such increases do not materialise, the government predicts only limited benefits, insufficient to offset the costs for either farmers or taxpayers. Unfortunately, the imminent pilot culls are too small and too short term to measure the impacts of licensed culling on cattle TB before a wider roll-out of the approach. The necessarily stringent licensing conditions mean that many TB-affected areas of England will remain ineligible for such culling.

  "<p>A Florida judge has ruled that a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who believes he is the \"Prince of God\" and is convinced that he will be resurrected to sit for eternity at God's right hand is sane and can put to death next week.</p> <p>David Glant, a judge with Florida's eighth circuit, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/463301-order-finding-ferguson-sane-12-october-2012-1.html\">has found</a> that John Ferguson, 64, can be given lethal injections next Thursday despite a US supreme court injunction that prohibits executions of the insane. In his concluding remarks, the judge agrees with the prisoner's defence lawyers that Ferguson is a paranoid schizophrenic who genuinely believes he is \"Prince of God\".</p> <p>The judge accepts that the prisoner has a \"long history of mental illness\" and finds there is no evidence to support the prosecution contention, made over several years, that Ferguson was pretending to be mentally ill in order to avoid execution. Yet he goes on to conclude that \"there is no evidence that his mental illness interferes, in any way, with his 'rational understanding' of the fact of his pending execution and the reason for it\".</p> <p>Astoundingly, the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/463301-order-finding-ferguson-sane-12-october-2012-1.html#document/p18/a77600\">judge goes on to say</a> that the prisoner's \"grandiose delusion\" of himself as being akin to Jesus at the point of his resurrection is in fact \"relatively normal Christian belief\". He writes: \"There is no evidence that Ferguson's belief as to his role in the world and what may happen to him in the afterlife is so significantly different from beliefs other Christians may hold so as to consider it a sign of insanity.\"</p> <p>Ferguson's legal team has appealed the ruling to the Florida supreme court and an initial hearing is likely to be held on Monday. Pending a final appeal to the US supreme court, the highest judicial panel in the land, the prisoner he will face execution by 4pm on Thursday.</p> <p>\"This is a guy with long-standing mental health issues that stretch over four decades, with 30 different doctors having diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic, including Florida state and court-appointed doctors. And yet he is sane enough to be executed?\" said Ben Lewis, one of Ferguson's defence lawyers.</p> <p>Ferguson was sentenced to death in 1978 for multiple murders. In July 1977, together with two other men, he was involved in the shooting of six men after breaking into a house in Carol City; the following year on his own he murdered two teenagers in Hialeah.</p> <p>Despite the undoubtedly harrowingly gruesome nature of his crimes, legally that should have no bearing on the current calculation as to whether he is mentally competent to be put to death. In 1986, in a case that coincidentally also arose in Florida, the supreme court ordered that under the eighth amendment of the US constitution, that bans cruel and unusual punishment, the death penalty could not be meted out to the insane.</p> <p>The judgment said: \"Whether the aim is to protect the condemned from fear and pain without comfort of understanding, or to protect the dignity of society itself from the barbarity of exacting mindless vengeance, the restriction finds enforcement in the eighth amendment.\"</p> <p>The earliest citing of Ferguson's mental health problems goes all the way back to 1965 when he was reported as having had visual hallucinations. He was frequently confined to hospital for psychosis and schizophrenia through the 1970s.</p> <p>In 1975 a doctor wrote that he had \"a long-standing, severe illness which will most likely require long-term inpatient hospitalisation. This man is dangerous and cannot be released under any circumstances.\"</p> <p>He was released, and two years later committed the first of his murders.</p> <p>Over the years Ferguson has regularly experienced hallucinations. He hears his dead father talking to him, believes that people are listening to him and at one point reported that cockroaches had entered his brain through his ears.</p> <p>Before this week's court hearing into Ferguson's state of mind, he was examined by a panel of three state-appointed psychiatrists. They interviewed him for just 90 minutes and on the basis of that found with \"reasonable medical certainty that Mr Ferguson has no genuine current mental illness and understands the nature and effect of the death penalty and why it was imposed on him\".</p> <p>In his report, Glant conceded that state-appointed doctors \"did not complete a thorough and exhaustive interview of Ferguson at Florida state prison\". But then, the judge added, \"That was not their mandate\".</p>",
  "<p>Like many others of his generation, the outspoken Labour MP for Middlesbrough, Stuart Bell, who has died of pancreatic&#xa0;cancer aged 74,&#xa0;was deprived of the opportunity of ministerial office by the length of&#xa0;time his party spent in opposition. Aged&#xa0;58 when Tony Blair became prime&#xa0;minister, Bell was appointed as the second church estates commissioner \u2013 answering questions from MPs on legislative issues and other matters regarding the Church of England \u2013 and&#xa0;became a powerful figure in the management of the House of Commons.</p> <p>Bell was not afraid to speak his mind, and attracted controversy on a&#xa0;number of issues, including the Cleveland child abuse scandal in 1987, the row over MPs'&#xa0;expenses, and the extent to which MPs should&#xa0;be freely accessible to their constituents. He was prepared, with a degree of sometimes foolhardy courage, to take a stand that did not conform to&#xa0;popular opinion.</p> <p>The trajectory of his career was unusual. He was born in High Spen, north-west Durham, the son of Margaret and Ernest, a miner. Stuart's first job was as a clerk at a colliery in Chopwell, the village once described by a right-wing newspaper as the \"reddest\" in the country, full of \"precocious Lenins\".</p> <p>Bell had a grammar school education at Hookergate, near Gateshead, and,&#xa0;after working at the pit, took a newspaper job on the Blaydon Courier and then a position as a night copytaker on the Daily Telegraph. His ambition was to become a reporter on <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/\" title=\"Hansard\">Hansard</a>, the official parliamentary record, and, to&#xa0;this end he secured an impressive 150-words-a-minute shorthand at the Pitman Training college in Holborn, London. He was diverted on his journey to the House of Commons by training as a lawyer, and was called to the bar at&#xa0;Gray's Inn in 1970.</p> <p>His seven years in Paris \u2013 as a lawyer representing large multinational companies, learning French and earning a fortune \u2013 did not endear him to his less materially successful colleagues when he reached the Commons in 1983. He had fought the 1979 election, losing to&#xa0;Geoffrey Rippon in Hexham, then secured election in 1980 to Newcastle city council, where he was vice-chairman of the education committee. When Arthur Bottomley announced his&#xa0;intention to retire as MP for Middlesbrough, Bell was selected from a&#xa0;shortlist including a young Tony Blair, and won the seat with predictable ease in 1983. In his maiden speech, Bell quoted William Morris on socialism and spoke of the need for welfare reform.</p> <p>His prospects looked promising when Roy Hattersley, then deputy Labour leader, made Bell his parliamentary private secretary. He shared the moderate political stance of his more experienced colleague, particularly on&#xa0;Europe, Nato and the need for the Labour party to reform itself. A member of the Fabian Society, Bell had written a booklet on Lords reform, published by the society in 1981, as he would later recall in his last speech on the same subject, in the Commons this July.</p> <p>After just a year, he was promoted to the opposition frontbench team when Neil Kinnock appointed him as a spokesman on Northern Ireland. Bell's career faltered, however, when he resigned in 1987, after becoming embroiled in the Cleveland scandal, in which dozens of children were said to have been sexually abused and were removed from their parents. Taking what in his view was the side of the families and children, Bell criticised the doctors involved and called for their suspension. Although he was personally criticised in the findings of the judicial inquiry for having made \"intemperate and inflammatory remarks\", it was probably owing to his noisy intervention that the inquiry was established. In 1992 he became frontbench spokesman on trade and industry.</p> <p>Though Bell showed support for Blair \u2013 his&#xa0;autobiography is called Tony Really Loves Me \u2013 he was not invited to join the government in 1997. This was despite a&#xa0;letter he delivered to the new prime minister at his constituency home, to be read on the day of the election. Quoted in his book, it read: \"I hope the wonderment of this day will live forever in your mind, you have deserved your success, you have a right to it, you are entitled to it and you will fashion and mould it not in your own self-interest but in the national interest.\"</p> <p>As well as being the second church estates commissioner, a post he held until 2010, he also chaired the finance and services select committee (2000-10), and was a member of the House of Commons commission for&#xa0;the same period. When the parliamentary expenses scandal broke in 2009, he&#xa0;was&#xa0;appointed to the Speaker's committee for the new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. He&#xa0;attempted to defend MPs in the expenses row, attacking the leak as \"disgraceful\", suggesting that the Legg inquiry was guilty of \"retrospectivity\" and that MPs could be&#xa0;justified in&#xa0;refusing to repay money they had&#xa0;claimed.</p> <p>His most recent clash with public opinion was when it was disclosed last year that he had not held a constituency surgery since 1997. Although he was dubbed \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/08/reality-check-britain-s-laziest-mp\" title=\"Reality check: Who are Britain's laziest parliamentarians?\">Britain's laziest MP</a>\", Bell asserted that he regularly met his voters, but since he had been physically threatened by one constituent his dealings were all by appointment.</p> <p>Knighted in 2004, Bell was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in 2006 for his contribution to British-French relations. He wrote a large number of political books, short stories and novels \u2013 including an erotic novel, Paris 69 (1973) \u2013 and was a shareholder in the company which published them.</p> <p>He married Margaret Bruce, whom he had met at a pit village dance, in 1960, and they had a son, Ian, and a daughter, Yvonne. After their divorce, in 1980 he married Margaret Allan, with whom he had a son, Malcolm. Margaret and his children survive him.</p> <p>\u2022 Stuart Bell, politician, born 16 May 1938; died 13 October 2012</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 October 2012 to remove this clause, inserted during editing: \"in which dozens of children were incorrectly diagnosed as having been sexually abused and were removed from their parents\". The article was also amended to clarify that while Bell believed he was acting in the children's interests, not everyone shared that view.<br></p>",
  "<p>It was one of the few quality newspaper success stories left in the developed world, but now Spain's El Pa\u00eds is to axe a third of its workforce as the country's media sector shrivels under the combined weight of the global newspaper crisis and a worsening domestic recession.</p> <p>The announcement has provoked bitter tensions within the newspaper as fears grow that the sale of a major share in El Pa\u00eds's debt-laden parent company, Prisa, to a group of New York-based investors in 2010 will lead to the paper being bled of resources or sold off. Juan Luis Cebri\u00e1n, the veteran former El Pa\u00eds editor who is now Prisa's chief executive, dropped the bombshell on the workforce a week ago. Of the 464 staff, the company plans to sack 128, send 21 into early retirement and exact a 15% pay cut from the remainder. Under labour law changes introduced earlier this year, the cost of shedding one-third of the workforce is about half what it would have been in 2011.</p> <p>Journalists at the paper responded with a two-day withdrawal of bylines, and plan to begin disruptive stoppages shortly. As tempers frayed, a union meeting urged the editor, Javier Moreno, to resign while Cebri\u00e1n was urged to pay back millions of euros he has earned in recent years. Management claimed the paper's survival was at stake. \"Either we change our model and the newspaper's structure or we cannot continue producing El Pa\u00eds,\" said the newspaper's chief executive, Jos\u00e9 Luis Sainz.</p> <p>There was a confrontation between Cebri\u00e1n and another former editor, Joaqu\u00edn Estefania, in a meeting with senior staff, amid concerns that Moreno was losing power over his own paper. \"I doubt he will last beyond the summer,\" said one disgruntled senior journalist.</p> <p>Moreno won a battle to persuade journalists to put their bylines back on articles last week, though union delegates denounced strong-arm tactics. \"These actions on the part of Moreno have created an irrevocable split between the newsroom and its editor,\" the newspaper's union chapel said. \"In the light of this, the El Pa\u00eds workforce takes the view that Javier Moreno is now unfit to occupy his post.\"</p> <p>Management argue that the historically profit-making paper finally began to lose money in August and that revenue was down \u20ac200m since 2007. Sales are expected to fall 10% this year to 320,000.</p> <p>\"We are not going to put out the same newspaper with fewer resources. It is time for a new transformation,\" said Moreno. It was not clear, however, what that new model involved for a brand that aims to be the global Spanish-language newspaper.</p> <p>El Pa\u00eds recently lost its digital boss Gumersindo Lafuente, who had turned around the paper's lacklustre online presence, amid rumours that he was fed up with foot-dragging over future plans.</p> <p>More importantly, El Pa\u00eds's founder and owner Jesus Polanco died in 2007, bringing an uncertain end to three decades in which the moderately leftwing paper had established itself as Spain's top-selling daily.</p> <p>Three years later, a group of investors headed by the \"homeless billionaire\" Nicolas Berggruen (who lives in hotels) and British-born Martin Franklin took a major share in Prisa and dug it out of a \u20ac4.7bn debt hole; Cebri\u00e1n told the Guardian then that the future would bring \"very deep change\".</p> <p>Cebri\u00e1n, who also claimed the slide in sales of El Pa\u00eds could be reversed, said he would stand down in 2013. Sales then were running at 375,000. The \u20ac650m deal reduced the holding of a core group of paternalistic shareholders, led by the Polanco family, from 70% to about 30% of Prisa.</p> <p>El Pa\u00eds, referred to by Berggruen as a \"trophy asset\", represents less than 10% of Prisa's business, with pay television and educational publishing its two biggest units.</p> <p>\"Our interest is in fixing the balance sheet, not in fixing the editorial content,\" Franklin told the Guardian at the time. \"What we want is a well-governed public company.\" Shortly after the deal was completed, Prisa announced that it would be cutting its 2,500-strong global workforce by 18%.</p> <p>The massive job losses at El Pa\u00eds came as two of Spain's other biggest newspaper groups, El Mundo publisher Unidad Editorial, and ABC publisher Vocento, were shedding employees too.</p> <p>Spain's overpopulated TV news industry is also shrinking, with the state broadcaster TVE announcing a plan to reduce salary costs by 25% and Valencia's regional broadcaster sacking 1,200 people. Prisa closed its CNN+ news channel in 2010, while recent mergers bringing together the private broadcasters La Sexta with Antena 3 and Tele5 with Cuatro are also shrinking Spain's journalism pool.</p> <p>El Pa\u00eds's struggles are only one part of a succession of editorial cutbacks that demonstrate how hard the country's economic crisis is hitting its media landscape.</p>",
  "<p>Japan's putative <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/japan-china-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">\"grabbing\" of the Senkaku Islands</a> has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/china-japan-senkaku-diaoyu-islands\" title=\"\">shrilly reported in Chinese media this past month</a>. Known in China as the Diaoyu Islands, this small collection of islets and rocky outcroppings in the East China Sea has lain outside of direct Chinese control since 1895. By 1970, the discovery of probable fossil fuel resources transformed these uninhabited islets into a watery stage for political theatre.</p> <p>Dangerous brinksmanship these past two months has seen incursions by Chinese marine surveillance craft, an embarrassing water gun naval \"battle\" between Taiwanese and Japanese ships, fierce anti-Japanese protests and torched Japanese factories on the mainland. Yet last Wednesday, Japan made a small but potentially important conciliatory gesture. <a href=\"http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2012/10/187022.html\" title=\"\">Official sources</a> indicated that they might be willing to \"acknowledge\" China's claim for the first time, a calculated move to allow the Chinese to save face and defuse tensions. It remains to be seen whether the scandal-weakened Chinese side would accept this, faced as they are with a delicate leadership transition in November and a population whose fury has helped put pressure on Japan but may prove difficult to rechannel.</p> <p>Chinese people's long-standing animus toward their erstwhile colonial overlord is, of course, very real. Yet Chinese rage against Japan, as performed, resembles a poorly sutured wound that the Chinese state can tear open and let bleed when expedient \u2013 though which the authorities sometimes hurry to stitch up again lest they risk losing control. Being in Beijing, Shanghai, and elsewhere in China this past September reminded me more than once of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate\" title=\"\">Two Minutes Hate</a> scene in Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, and even of Hate Week itself.</p> <p>Winston, the novel's wretched protagonist, describes the Two Minutes Hate as a \"hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness\" where one \"could not help sharing in the general delirium\". Groups of co-workers unleash a brief torrent of ritual patriotic abuse each morning in dystopian London, snarling and screaming at the despicable figures of the enemy that flash on a big telescreen.</p> <p>Comparisons between present-day China and the soulless, dreary totalitarian socialist state immortalised in Orwell's masterpiece are difficult to sustain after seeing clutch after clutch of Chinese teenagers, dressed in the latest quasi-Japanophile fashion, walk down a mobbed Beijing pedestrian shopping arcade nibbling at bouquets of candy floss and prattling on as if the phrase \"commodity fetishism\" had never crossed their young lips.</p> <p>Yet the blistering anti-Japanese media campaign I witnessed upon my arrival in China bore a close resemblance to the organised \"hate\" that Orwell so memorably described. Chinese TV, for example, featured cartoonish portrayals of rightwing Japanese wannabe powerbrokers attempting to inflame the territorial dispute. Of course, it seemed to matter little that many such reactionaries in Japan are widely seen as out-of-touch and occasionally as buffoons. (Though wary of Chinese intimidation, Japan's population is, nearly seventy years after WWII, about as truly pacifist as I've encountered in the industrialised world.)</p> <p>Other menacing video depicted imposing American naval carrier groups, suggesting that just out of view on China's coast lurked sinister forces bent on further predatory operations against islets there. Tellingly, the Chinese navy chose this juncture to unveil its first aircraft carrier, refurbished after purchase from the Ukraine. Chinese warplanes are apparently not yet capable of landing on the carrier, but the move played well with Chinese audiences and sent an aggressive message to China's rivals.</p> <p>In rather comical solidarity, Chinese networks also started broadcasting weather reports for the Diaoyu Islands, as if any day now Chinese holidaymakers might lounge on a steep, rocky shoreline overlooking the area's shark-infested waters.</p> <p>The tacitly state-sanctioned venting of spleen against Japan certainly came easily to a lot of Chinese, many raised since childhood to look askance at things Japanese. Thousands participated in protests, during which Chinese pelted the Japanese embassy in Beijing, and consulates elsewhere, with eggs, bottles, rocks, and other missiles. Angry mobs in a range of cities vandalised Japanese businesses there and called for boycotts of Japanese products. Such bigotry, while no doubt sincere, could lead to absurd outcomes. For example, a group of taxi drivers accused one of my friends (a European woman with light brown hair, blue eyes and fair skin) of being Japanese and refused her fare. The occasional puzzling rumour that \"Japanese people\" were in town \u2013 meaning us \u2013 circulated around during our time there. Perhaps xenophobia takes what it can get.</p> <p>The Chinese authorities' historical tendency to unleash, then rein in, such demonstrations of anti-Japanese sentiment is, fittingly, prefigured in Orwell's prose as well: after all, such hate \"could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp\" \u2013 and could even be directed toward China's politburo itself. Though this summer's xenophobic venting may have proven useful, the chances are that, in the runup to the party's 18th national congress on 8 November \u2013 inaugurating a tense, once-a-decade leadership transition \u2013 the state will choose stability over frenzy.</p> <p>Ironically, this coming period could have been a \"Nixon to China\" opportunity for Beijing. The deep scars of wartime memory notwithstanding, Chinese and Japanese economic partnership has proved highly compatible and profitable in recent years. Though extremely unlikely in practice, if the new Chinese leadership sought rapprochement, the two nations could, potentially, even deepen co-operation to reverse slowing growth in China's economy and revitalise Japan's anaemic one. I believe the will exists on the Japanese side, however weary they are of Chinese bullying. Perhaps the biggest obstacle remains the \"blowlamp\" of nationalist Chinese opinion itself. After years of stoking the furnace of Chinese public outrage \u2013 to diplomatic and political advantage \u2013 Chinese leaders might find it difficult to avoid the blowback.</p>",

A weakness of English clubs in Europe in recent seasons has been their vulnerability when game plans are set alight: it is less the lack of a plan B that is exposed but an inability, or reluctance, of players to react if a match veers off a set course.</p> <p>Northampton were still trailing 15-0 with four minutes of the first half remaining but it was Glasgow who went into the interval team-talk deflated. The Saints did not radically alter their approach; they merely stopped running in straight lines: they scored two tries in four minutes, both from lineouts, as all six in the match were, after making the visitors deal with the unexpected.</p> <p>First the second-row Samu Manoa, positioned in midfield, took a short pass and stepped between two defenders. He ran into Glasgow's 22 and, when he was eventually tackled, Northampton had the numbers out wide, even if George Pisi was fortunate that his attempted pass to James Wilson outside him bounced back into his own hands after Tommy Seymour's attempted interception. There were 20 seconds of the half remaining when Northampton were awarded, a shade fortunately, a penalty from a scrum. They kicked to touch and from the lineout near halfway Ken Pisi came into midfield from the right wing and beat Alex Dunbar on the outside before supplying a scoring pass to his brother.</p> <p>The tries may have been down to efficiency and execution rather than spontaneity, much the way Saracens had won at Edinburgh the previous day, clinically implementing set plays, but by not seeking contact Northampton exposed the faultline in Glasgow's defence and turned the match.</p> <p>The Saints were ahead 150 seconds after the restart with their third try in little more than six minutes. Another penalty, another lineout and, after Dominic Waldouck, Soane Tonga'uiha and Tom Wood had attacked the line, Dylan Hartley passed to the unmarked Stephen Myler outside him.</p> <p>Myler's failure with the boot kept Glasgow in touch for most of the rest of the half. The outside-half missed four of his five kicks, including a penalty from just to the right of the posts after 63 minutes, and for a long period after his try the game almost stagnated, certainly dropping in intensity. Northampton dominated in terms of possession and territory, with Glasgow unable to relieve the siege: there were only two points between the teams but it may as well have been 200.</p> <p>Glasgow had not been helped by the early loss of the full-back Stuart Hogg or the departure of the outside-half Ruaridh Jackson at the interval. When the former Northampton wing Sean Lamont was helped off with 23 minutes left, they were forced to field a flanker and a scrum-half on the flanks. The watching Scotland coach, Andy Robinson, had seen two more of his national squad's backs, Greig Laidlaw and Tim Visser, suffer injuries playing for Edinburgh and his attacking options next month may be limited.</p> <p>It was not until 10 minutes from the end that Northampton secured the victory and the bonus point, Vasily Artemyev scoring in the corner shortly after Hartley was deemed by the television match official, like Ken Pisi in the first half, to have lost control of the ball in the attempted act of scoring. Glasgow found themselves stripped of even a bonus point, a harsh return given their initial dominance.</p> <p>Their two tries, from Al Kellock's lineout wins, came in four minutes after Peter Horne had opened the scoring with a penalty at the end of the first quarter. The flanker Josh Strauss scored the first and Lamont thwarted four defenders to claim the second, the last Glasgow saw of the Northampton line.</p> <p>Both teams have a short turnaround before their next matches on Friday, Northampton at Castres, where they conceded 41 points last season, while Glasgow entertain unbeaten Ulster. \"Castres will have had two more days rest than us, and I do not think that is right given that we are travelling to France, but we are in decent shape,\" said the Saints' director of rugby, Jim Mallinder. Glasgow are unlikely to qualify from the group but they may have a say in who does.</p> <p><strong>Northampton</strong> Wilson (Lamb, 57); K Pisi, G Pisi (May, 73), Waldouck, Artemyev; Myler, Dickson (Roberts, 73); Tonga'uiha (Waller, 71), Hartley (capt; Haywood, 78), Mujati (Doran-Jones, 67), Manoa (Sorenson, 64), Lawes, Dowson, Wood, Oakley.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> G Pisi 2, Myler, Artemyev. <strong>Con</strong> Myler, Lamb.</p> <p><strong>Glasgow</strong> Hogg (Murchie, 10); Seymour, Dunbar, Horne, Lamont (Gillies, 67); Jackson (Matawalu, h-t), Pyrgos; Grant (Fainga'anuku, 71), Hall, Cusack, Swinson (Ryder, 52), Kellock (capt), Strauss (Eddie, 64), Barclay (Fusaro, 57), Wilson.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Strauss, Lamont. <strong>Con</strong> Horne. <strong>Pen</strong> Horne.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> R Poite (France)</p> <p><strong>Attendance:</strong> 12,115</p>",

  "<p>The first ever private abortion clinic on the island of Ireland has hired security guards to protect clients and staff when it opens in Belfast on Thursday, the international director of the sexual health charity Marie Stopes has confirmed.</p> <p>Marie Stopes's decision to offer abortion services in Northern Ireland for those up to nine weeks pregnant will also make it easier for women in the Irish Republic to seek a termination for the first time ever on the island. The charity's arrival in Belfast comes as the Catholic church is launching a major anti-abortion \"40 weeks for life\" campaign to oppose any reform of the law by Dublin.</p> <p>Anti-abortion activists in Northern Ireland have said they will try to stop women terminating their pregnancies at Marie Stopes's premises in central Belfast from this week onwards. Groups such as Precious Life have promised protests and demonstrations outside the clinic.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian in advance of the clinic's opening at Belfast's Great Victoria Street, Tracey McNeil, the director of UK and Europe for Marie Stopes, said she had concerns about safety for staff and clients using their services.</p> <p>\"We have looked very close at security and we have got arrangements in place,\" she said.</p> <p>Asked if security guards would be in place at the Belfast clinic, McNeil replied: \"Yes, there will, but you know I really hope it's peaceful. People have a right to protest and I respect that.</p> <p>\"What I appeal for is that this is peaceful and that we allow our team members and our clients to come in and out of the clinic in a way that they won't feel threatened or abused. But I will do absolutely everything to protect our team and our clients.\"</p> <p>McNeil pointed out that even from time to time in England, where unlike Northern Ireland the 1967 Abortion Act allows for terminations up to 24 weeks, Marie Stopes clinics have to employ security staff.</p> <p>\"I am always mindful of the security of our team members and that is something we take very seriously. I would be foolish if I was not concerned about that.\"</p> <p>Marie Stopes has also been working with the Police Service of Northern Ireland to review their security needs in advance of the opening, she said.</p>",
  "<p>If you smile at your boss and she smiles back, beware. It could be a sign that she does not think too highly of you, according to a study.</p> <p>People who feel powerful are more likely to mimic the smiles of those they perceive as low status, according to research <a href=\"http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=82d13076-a508-43b3-a229-b6333b7f615c&amp;cKey=11774f7a-10fd-429d-842e-787f976fa235&amp;mKey={70007181-01C9-4DE9-A0A2-EEBFA14CD9F1}\" title=\"\">presented at the annual Society for Neuroscience conference in New Orleans</a>. They are less likely, however, to return the smiles of people they consider of higher status than themselves. And when people are not feeling particularly powerful, they return everyone's smiles almost equally.</p> <p>Mimicking other people's behaviour is an important mechanism of bonding in group situations, according to Evan Carr from the <a href=\"http://www.psychology.ucsd.edu/people/graduate-students-gallery.html\" title=\"\">department of psychology at the University of California</a> in San Diego, who led the study. \"Mimicry has been shown to help build relationships, and both power and status seem to affect how we unconsciously employ this strategy,\" he said.</p> <p>Power, he said, referred to someone's internal feeling of being able to take control of others, whereas status was a more externally defined quality. \"It's more to do with perceived reverence or some type of social hierarchy,\" said Carr.</p> <p>To examine how mimicry was influenced by a person's power and the status of those around them, Carr asked 55 volunteers to watch videos of high-status people (such as a doctor or business leader) or low-status people (a worker in a fast food restaurant, say, or a rubbish collector) either being happy or angry. Before they watched the videos, the volunteers had been split into groups and primed to feel either more or less powerful by writing an essay about a particularly good or bad event in their lives.</p> <p>While the volunteers watched the videos, Carr measured the activity of two facial muscles: the zygomaticus major (the so-called \"smiling muscle\" that raises the corners of the mouth) and corrugator supercilii (the so-called \"frowning muscle\" that creases the brow).</p> <p>Carr found that responding to smiles was more complicated than expected. \"If you feel powerful, you suppress smiling to targets that are of a higher status,\" he said. \"If you see Joe the senior vice-president and he's smiling at you, but you feel powerful, you feel less of a need to smile back at him. For the low-power condition, you return more smiles to everyone, regardless of their status. That's interesting in the sense that it seems to be along the lines of a deference response \u2013 if you feel low-power, you're more likely to be submissive to another person you're interacting with. You would be more likely to smile at everybody.\"</p> <p>The frowning muscle showed more straightforward results: regardless of how powerful the volunteer felt, they mimicked the frowns of higher-status people more often and with more intensity than the frowns of lower-status people.</p> <p>A large part of the social mimicry process seems to be subconscious. Carr used a technique called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_electromyography\" title=\"\">facial electromyograph</a> to measure muscle activity in volunteers' faces, which records the minute electrical currents whenever a muscle twitches. It is so sensitive that it can measure electrical activity even when the muscle itself does not look as though it is moving to an observer. This was a useful way to capture all of the true reactions by volunteers, even when they did not seem to be moving their face in response to a video. \"If you watch the video playback of many of these subjects, they would look like they just had a stoic expression looking at the screen,\" said Carr. \"The interesting thing is that subjects do not know that they are activating their muscles at all.\"</p>",
  "<p>Syrian government forces have used Russian-made cluster bombs on populated areas in their effort to push back rebel advances along the country's main north-south highway, according to Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>The watchdog on Sunday pointed to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUj0ocH87EU&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">videos put up on the internet</a> showing bomblets from cluster munitions in Idlib, Homs, Aleppo and Latakia provinces and outside Damascus. It said interviews with witnesses backed up the video evidence and there were clear signs the weapons had been dropped from aircraft.</p> <p>The allegations came as President Bashar al-Assad's government was struggling to stop opposition forces consolidating their hold on Idlib province, on the Turkish border. The rebels were reported to have surrounded an army garrison of several hundred men at Urum al-Sughra, between the contested city of Aleppo, the country's commercial and industrial centre, and the frontier.</p> <p>\"Rebels attacked an armoured column sent from Aleppo to rescue the 46th Regiment at Urum al-Sughra and stopped it in its tracks,\" Firas Fuleifel, an opposition activist told Reuters by phone from Idlib. He said a Syrian air force jet was shot down while trying to provide air support to the column.</p> <p>Sunday's Human Rights Watch report said there were Soviet-era markings on the cluster bombs used over the past few days but it was unclear when they had been delivered to Syria. Russia continued to be Syria's main arms suppliers after the demise of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>More than 100 countries have signed a treaty banning the use of cluster bombs on the grounds that they are indiscriminate weapons and unexploded bomblets scattered across a wide area in the wake of an attack pose an unacceptable threat to civilians. Neither Syria nor Russia has signed the 2010 treaty. Nor have China and the US.</p> <p>\"Syria's disregard for its civilian population is all too evident in its air campaign, which now apparently includes dropping these deadly cluster bombs into populated areas,\" said Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch. \"Cluster bombs have been comprehensively banned by most nations, and Syria should immediately stop all use of these indiscriminate weapons that continue to kill and maim for years.\"</p> <p>Turkey closed its airspace to Syrian airliners on Saturday, four days after it claimed to have found weaponry on a Syrian Air Airbus flying to Damascus from Moscow, which Turkish warplanes forced to land on suspicion of gun-running. The Russian government insisted the plane had been carrying legal radar components in its hold, but Turkey said the consignment included missile parts. The Russian newspaper Kommersant said the consignment had been sent by a company in the Russian city of Tula, which manufactures missiles and radar equipment.</p> <p>Following the Airbus incident on 10 October, Syria accused Turkey of \"piracy\" and banned Turkish overflights on Saturday. Turkey had stopped using Syrian airspace some months previously and its foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said on Sunday: \"The Syrian announcement has no value for us.\"</p> <p>The Airbus incident was a low point in the Turkish-Russian relationship, which has been severely strained by the conflict in Syria. The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, lambasted the UN security council at a conference in Istanbul for its failure to intervene in the Syrian conflict, in what was regarded as thinly-veiled criticism of Russia and China, which have vetoed any direct pressure on Assad's regime.</p> <p>\"The UNS security council has not intervened in the human tragedy that has been going on in Syria for 20 months,\" he said. \"There's an attitude that encourages, gives the green light to, Assad to kill tens or hundreds of people every day,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron is to sign a historic deal with Alex Salmond to hold a legally watertight referendum on Scottish independence, signalling the start of a 100-week battle over the UK's constitutional future.</p> <p>The prime minister will fly to Scotland on Monday to settle the terms of a Scotland-wide referendum, expected to be held in autumn 2014, by publishing a 35-clause long deal with the first minister that is already being dubbed the \"Edinburgh agreement\" by Salmond officials.</p> <p>With disputes over legal limits to campaign spending still yet to be solved, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's deputy first minister, said on Sunday that the deal would allow all the key elements of the referendum to be \"made in Scotland\".</p> <p>After months of negotiations, it would allow both sides to properly begin making the choices clear to voters. Speaking on BBC1, Sturgeon said \"it will be for the Scottish parliament to decide the date, the question, the franchise, for the referendum\".</p> <p>Sturgeon signalled that a core message for the nationalists will be to portray their main opponents, the Scottish Labour party, as allies of the Tory government in London after Labour began questioning the costs to Scotland of free university tuition, free prescriptions and the council tax freeze.</p> <p>\"We will make it abundantly clear what people will be voting for if they vote 'yes',\" she said on Sky News. \"But of course the responsibility also lies with those advocating a 'no' vote to say what voting no would mean. As far as I can see it would mean the continued dismantling of our welfare state and the continued squandering of Scotland's resources.\"</p> <p>Salmond, who launches the SNP's annual conference later this week, will claim that the vote will allow Scotland a once in a lifetime choice between freedom and stagnation. His opponents, buouyed by a slide in support for independence in recent polls, plan to unveil proposals for greater devolution as an alternative to leaving the UK.</p> <p>Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary in the UK government, said the referendum was the most important question facing Scotland for 300 years. \"I believe it will now allow us to put up in lights the big issues about the big debate [on] what is best for Scotland,\" Moore said on BBC 1's Sunday Politics.</p> <p>\"I believe that when we look at the economy, at defence, at our place in the world, on all these big issues people across Scotland will continue to support Scotland being in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>\"Independence is about Scotland leaving the UK, becoming a separate state, taking on all the burdens and risks that go with that and losing the benefits and opportunities that we have as part of the UK.\"</p> <p>Under the deal, Westminster MPs will temporarily give the Scottish parliament the legal authority to hold the referendum, overseen by the UK Electoral Commission, but with a sunset clause which removes that power at the end of 2014.</p> <p>UK government sources said they were not prepared to allow Salmond to postpone the referendum if opinion polls suggested he would lose.</p> <p>Under UK referendum legislation, which is policed by the Electoral Commission, Holyrood will be allowed to extend the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds for the first time in a major vote. The Scottish parliament has already allowed them to vote in health board and crofting elections.</p> <p>But there growing signs that Salmond's government will clash with the commission over campaign spending limits. A deal allowing Holyrood to set those limits was one of the last issues to be settled last week, but Salmond and the commission are at odds on how much can be spent.</p> <p>His ministers fear that the commission's proposal to allow all registered parties to spend up to \u00a31.5m during the last 16 weeks of the campaign, in addition to separate spending by each official referendum campaign based on their vote at the last Scottish elections, will give the three pro-UK parties of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems a significant advantage.</p> <p>Despite being given \u00a32m in donations towards independence, Salmond wants to limit spending by each of the parties to \u00a3250,000 in the last four months of the campaign, with the official yes and no campaigns limited to \u00a3750,000 each.</p> <p>Both sides claim they have achieved their main goals in the talks, but the honours are divided. Salmond has been forced to accept only a single, yes or no, question on Scottish independence and to agree to appoint the UK Electoral Commission to judge the fairness of the question, and to police spending and voting rules \u2013 a measure he heavily resisted last year.</p> <p>Attempts by the first minister behind the scenes to build a powerful coalition between business leaders and civic organisations to add an electorally popular second option to the referendum, for much greater powers for the Scottish parliament within the UK, failed because it lacked support.</p> <p>Salmond wanted this \"devolution plus\" option added to the referendum in case he lost on the independence vote.</p> <p>The latest opinion polls suggest popular support for independence is sliding: a TNS BMRB poll last week said there was now a 25-point gap in favour of remaining in the UK. Senior SNP sources admit their private polling also shows staying in the UK is currently more popular.</p> <p>Along with giving way on votes for 16 and 17-year-olds, Cameron has conceded that the poll will be held at a time of Salmond's choosing: autumn 2014 rather than next year, his original preference.</p> <p>Alastair Darling, the former Labour chancellor who now leads the Better Together pro-UK campaign, said on Sunday he would have preferred the vote in autumn 2013 and objected to extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds as a one off, rather than as a permanent measure.</p> <p>The first minister wants the vote in 2014 largely because Scotland is hosting several high profile cultural and sporting events that year. Salmond also believes the UK government's spending cuts will be so unpopular by then, and the Tory-Lib Dem coalition so divided, it will strengthen Scottish support for independence.</p> <p>Salmond will host a second \"year of homecoming\" and a clan gathering for expatriate Scots as the country marks the 700th anniversary of the famous Scottish victory over the English as the Battle of Bannockburn.</p> <p>In the summer of 2014, Scotland will host the Commonwealth games and the Ryder Cup golf competition between Europe and the USA.</p>",
  "<p>Sexist stereotypes, humiliating photographs of women and male bylines dominate the front pages of British newspapers, according to research carried out by the industry body Women in Journalism (WiJ).</p> <p>Male journalists wrote 78% of all front-page articles and men accounted for 84% of those mentioned or quoted in lead pieces, according to analysis of nine national newspapers, Monday to Saturday, over the course of four weeks.</p> <p>The only females to be regularly pictured in the period were the Duchess of Cambridge; her sister, Pippa Middleton, and the crime victim Madeleine McCann. The three males most likely to be photographed were Simon Cowell, whose biography was published that month; Nicolas Sarkozy, who was fighting an election, and Prince William.</p> <p>Women's groups, which complained about sexist stereotypes in the media in a presentation to the Leveson inquiry into media ethics, welcomed the research. Anna van Heeswijk, chief executive of Object, said: \"With newspapers so male-dominated, is it any surprise that women are portrayed the way they are? Changing the number of female writers and the ways in which women are portrayed in the media is crucial if we are serious about wanting a socially responsible press.\"</p> <p>Harriet Harman, the deputy leader of the Labour party, who has long campaigned against sexism, said: \"The media is supposed to reflect the views of everybody. How much is it really reflecting the views of women in this country? In parliament, with men in the media reporting on men in parliament, there is a double whammy.\"</p> <p>Women in Journalism's research reflects a malaise that George Entwistle, the BBC's new director general, admits is writ large in broadcasting. The BBC has faced pressure over its treatment of women on screen after a series of damaging rows over ageism and sexism involving the newsreader Moira Stuart, the former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips and the former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly. In recent years, figures such as Anna Ford, Selina Scott, Kate Adie, Dame Joan Bakewell and many others have spoken of their concerns about the treatment of older women by broadcasters.</p> <p>Entwistle's predecessor, Mark Thompson, also admitted the broadcaster had a \"case to answer\" over the lack of female presenters, especially in \"iconic roles\". Entwistle recently went further, saying not enough had been done to promote female experts or ensure they took part in news programmes, including Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p>Entwistle said: \"There's real headway with Amanda Vickery, Mary Beard and Lucy Worsley. We have made real progress in actively looking for, and finding, great female experts to front our big factual shows, but it's not enough.</p> <p>\"The Today programme struggles because we are dealing with party politics as it is, dealing with the world as it is, and that's a very male place. What the BBC often reflects is the way the world is.\"</p> <p>Women in Journalism's study closely reflected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/04/why-british-public-life-dominated-men\" title=\"\">research</a> carried out by the Guardian last year, which revealed that in a typical month, 78% of newspaper articles are written by men, 72% of Question Time contributors are men and 84% of reporters and guests on Radio Four's Today programme are men.</p> <p>The findings are also in line with <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/31/men-rule-media-coverage-of-women-s-news.html\" title=\"\">US research by the 4th Estate </a>earlier this year, which found that in media reports on women's issues, including abortion and birth control, men are quoted around five times more than women.</p> <p>WiJ found that the most male-dominated title was the Independent newspaper, with 91% of its 70 front-page articles written by men in the period studied. In contrast, 50% of the 24 bylines leading the Express were female journalists.</p> <p>Among the so-called quality press, the Financial Times had the biggest proportion \u2013 34% \u2013 of female writers appearing on its front page. Male bylines are more prevalent at the Telegraph (89%), the Sun (86%) and the Times (82%). The Guardian had a 78% male skew.</p> <p>Of the 668 people named in lead articles, 84% of those quoted or mentioned were men, most being quoted in their professional capacity. This compared with just 16% women, who were disproportionately likely to be quoted as victims and celebrities.</p> <p>Although there was greater gender equality in the photographs used on front pages, there was not a single female politician or leader in the top 10 images used during the month in question.</p> <p>Where powerful women were featured, the images were often unflattering. For instance, the home secretary, Theresa May, appeared as the main picture four times during the month, but three of those were the same image of her pulling her mouth down in an accentuated grimace.</p> <p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was pictured three times, but twice the shot was of her with her hands thrown up in the air, puffing her cheeks out. There were few pictures in which women looked powerful and serious.</p> <p>In an interview after appearing before the Leveson inquiry, the singer Charlotte Church described the way women were portrayed in the UK media as despicable. It \"erodes everything that women have been trying to build for years and years\", <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18553269\" title=\"\">she added</a>.Object and three other women's groups, including End Violence Against Women, are monitoring the press for harmful portrayals of women \u2013 particularly victims of violence \u2013 to raise awareness of the issue during the Leveson inquiry. They are also talking separately to media regulators such as Ofcom about the issue.</p> <p><em>Additional research by Rachel Cranshaw and Kira Cochrane.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2012 to rephrase a reference to the abducted child Madeleine McCann being \"regularly photographed\" during the period in question. She was also referred to as a woman.</p>",
  "<p>Afghanistan's government has lashed out at Imran Khan after the former Pakistan cricket star, now a politician, said the Taliban were fighting a \"holy war\" in the country that was justified by Islamic&#xa0;law.</p> <p>Speaking after visiting a hospital in Peshawar where Malala Yousafzai \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/pakistan-girl-shot-activism-swat-taliban?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">14-year-old activist shot in the head by the Taliban for supporting girls' education</a> \u2013 was treated last week, Khan told reporters that insurgents in Afghanistan were fighting a \"jihad\". Citing a verse from the Qur'an, he said: \"It is very clear that whoever is fighting for their freedom is fighting a jihad \u2026</p> <p>\"The people who are fighting in Afghanistan against the foreign occupation are fighting a jihad,\" he added, according to a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3waV9r1gxU&amp;list=UUA8R4NNFAf9I6aipqdgoUwg&amp;index=5&amp;feature=plcphttp://\">video of remarks to journalists</a>.</p> <p>Afghan politicians have reacted with disbelief, with one parliamentarian suggesting Khan should be arrested. The Ulema Council, a grouping of senior clerics, declared his comments \"unislamic\".</p> <p>A Kabul foreign ministry spokesman said Khan was \"either profoundly and dangerously ignorant about the reality in Afghanistan, or he has ill will against the Afghan people.</p> <p>\"Our children are killed on daily basis, civilians killed and our schools, hospitals and infrastructure attacked on a daily basis. To call any of that jihad is profoundly wrong and misguided.\"</p> <p>Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, has written to all of Pakistan's political leaders, including Khan, saying: \"We must ask why we have been unable to counter the terrorism that is attacking our people, and the promise of a better future for our children.\"</p> <p>Khan has also courted criticism by saying he will not publicly name the Taliban while criticising the men who attempted to kill Malala, because he feared it would put his party's supporters at risk.</p> <p>The row with Kabul highlights the awkward political situation Khan has found himself in recent days. He has long blamed the rise of the Taliban in the country on the US, saying its military operations in Afghanistan and the CIA drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal belt are responsible for the upsurge in militancy.</p> <p>But his populist position has been challenged by the almost unprecedented public anger against the Pakistani Taliban triggered by the attempt to kill Malala as she sat in a van with her classmates in Swat last Tuesday.</p> <p>While many observers fear the mood of national outrage will ultimately change little, the country's media continues to cover the saga intensively while the country's powerful military chief called on the nation to \"unite and stand up to fight\" against extremism.</p> <p>The foreign minister has even suggested the attack might be a turning point for a country that has long struggled to muster support for a decisive push against militants. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people attended a rally in Karachi in support of Malala, organised by the Muttahida Qaumi movement, the dominant political party in the southern city.</p> <p>Malala is unconscious and in intensive care in a military hospital in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. A military spokesman said her condition was improving and that no decision had been made as to whether she should be sent overseas, despite an offer from the United Arab Emirates to supply an air ambulance.</p> <p>Local media continued to focus on her condition despite government warnings that the Pakistani Taliban, apparently angered by criticism of the attack on Malala, had ordered attacks on journalists.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below)</strong></p> <p>Extensive travel will likely prevent me from writing much this weekend, but there are several brief items worthy of note:</p> <p><strong>(1)</strong> In Sunday's Washington Post, law professor Jonathan Turley has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-four-arguments-the-western-world-uses-to-limit-free-speech/2012/10/12/e0573bd4-116d-11e2-a16b-2c110031514a_story.html\">superb Op-Ed</a> on the gradual death of free speech in the west, and he places the blame squarely where it belongs: on the veneration of \"sensitivities\" over the free flow of ideas, and relatedly, the adolescent need on the part of many adults to plead with authority figures to shield them from views they find offensive. His essay is well worth reading in full, but here is the crux:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Free speech is dying in the western world. While most people still enjoy considerable freedom of expression, this right, once a near-absolute, has become less defined and less dependable for those espousing controversial social, political or religious views. The decline of free speech has come not from any single blow but rather from thousands of paper cuts of well-intentioned exceptions designed to maintain social harmony. . . . </p> <p>\"Of course, free speech is often precisely about pissing off other people \u2013 challenging social taboos or political values. . . . </p> <p>\"Such efforts focus not on the right to speak but on the possible reaction to speech \u2013 a fundamental change in the treatment of free speech in the West. The much-misconstrued statement of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that free speech does not give you the right to shout fire in a crowded theater is now being used to curtail speech that might provoke a violence-prone minority. Our entire society is being treated as a crowded theater, and talking about whole subjects is now akin to shouting 'fire!' . . . .</p> <p>\"The very right that laid the foundation for western civilization is increasingly viewed as a nuisance, if not a threat. Whether speech is deemed inflammatory or hateful or discriminatory or simply false, society is denying speech rights in the name of tolerance, enforcing mutual respect through categorical censorship.</p> <p>\"As in a troubled marriage, the west seems to be falling out of love with free speech. Unable to divorce ourselves from this defining right, we take refuge instead in an awkward and forced silence.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm accused with some frequency of focusing my critiques on the US - the reason I do so is <a href=\"http://noam-chomsky.tumblr.com/post/17547861328/my-own-concern-is-primarily-the-terror-and\">set forth here in reasoning I adopt in full</a> - but vibrant free speech protection is a core liberty which the US, though <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/conservatives-democrats-free-speech-muslims\">very far from perfect</a>, still <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/02/are-there-american-political-values.html\">safeguards better than most countries</a>. </p> <p>What has always driven repression of speech are the same universal human traits that are now flourishing as part of this latest effort: the tyrannical thirst for the power to silence ideas one dislikes, the self-regarding belief that one can apply objective principles of decency, \"community\" and Goodness to decide which modes of expression and which ideas should be barred, authoritarian trust in leaders, and \u2013 worst of all \u2013 the refusal to understand that endorsing repression of ideas leaves one with no principled grounds to object when one's own ideas end up on the prohibited list. </p> <p>Throughout history, it has often been the case that today's \"hate speech\" becomes tomorrow's enlightenment. Today's \"incitement\" becomes tomorrow's righteous subversion of unjust authority and flawed orthodoxies. </p> <p>Add to all that the ignoble tendency to object to - or even recognize the existence of - repression only when it affects one directly (a dynamic I <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/believing-oppression-only-happens.html\">described here</a> when writing about the inability of many passive, obedient western citizens to acknowledge the repression of their own governments because such citizens are never the ones targeted for repression), and it's clear that the opposition to free expression is grounded in the worst of human attributes. </p> <p>In sum, it takes a staggering amount of hubris to believe you're in any position to decide which ideas are so objectively and permanently wrong that they should be barred. It takes an equally staggering amount of childishness to want some central authority to protect you from ideas that you find upsetting. And it takes extreme historical ignorance not to realize that endorsing the maintenance of a list of prohibited ideas and then empowering authorities to enforce it will inevitably lead to abusive applications of that power and, sooner or later, will likely result in the suppression of your own ideas as well.</p> <p><strong>(2)</strong> The New York Times this morning <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/world/africa/libyan-government-struggles-to-rein-in-powerful-militias.html?hp\">reports on the</a> pervasive violence, chaos, instability and militia rule still hopelessly plaguing Libya almost a year after Gadaffi's brutal killing. In sum, the \"central government\" has no real authority outside of Tripoli and must therefore depend upon the very militias which they claim they are trying to undermine, a dilemma that is \"trapping Libya in a state of lawlessness\". Moreover, the temptation on the part of the US government to launch strikes in Libya at those who attacked the consulate would likely trigger \"a popular and potentially violent backlash in\" what the New York Times calls \"the only Arab country whose people largely have warm feelings toward Washington\".</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of Gadaffi's death, proponents of the intervention <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/18cb7f14-ce3c-11e0-99ec-00144feabdc0.html\">rushed to publicly congratulate themselves</a> and declare their pro-war position vindicated, to serve as a model for future wars. Worse, war proponents (with a <a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/2012/06/despite-airport-incident-henry-kissinger-is-wrong-about-libya.html\">couple noble exceptions</a>) flamboyantly celebrated their own prescience and then ignored the aftermath of the war they helped cheer on, even though it is only that aftermath that will determine whether the intervention was actually good or bad for most Libyans. Only the controversy surrounding the Benghazi attack has re-focused attention on the struggles in that country after the war.</p> <p>Rather obviously, this was yet another example of the \"Mission Accomplished\" banner being waved quite prematurely. How many times does it need be proven that merely killing a dictator does not remotely guarantee an improvement from either the perspective of US interests or the people in the country being invaded? And how many more examples do we need where the US funds and arms a fighting force to do its bidding, only to turn around and find that it now must fight that same force?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dqn0bm4E9yw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dqn0bm4E9yw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>(3)</strong> So <a href=\"http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/08/09/glenn-greenwald/the-digital-surveillance-state-vast-secret-and-dangerous/\">pervasive is the US Surveillance State</a> that even one who follows it extensively can sometimes be surprised by its reach. I recall when a Virginia Tech student, Seung-Hui Cho, went on a campus shooting rampage in 2007, and I <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2007/04/18/surveillance_14/\">noticed this passage</a> that appeared buried in <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=3048108&amp;page=2#.UHrAYsXA8po\">an ABC News report</a> on the incident: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Some news accounts have suggested that Cho had a history of antidepressant use, but senior federal officials tell ABC News that they can find no record of such medication in the government's files.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I was actually amazed back then to learn that the US government maintains files of all prescription drug usage by all citizens. As it turns out, such \"files\" are maintained pursuant to <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr1132/text\">a 2005 law</a> which, the government claims, authorizes it to monitor and record all prescription drug use by all citizens via so-called \"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs.\" </p> <p>I had a somewhat similar reaction when I was reading <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/11/passenger-smoke-bomb/1627519/\">an account in USA Today</a> about a US citizen who was arrested this week at the Los Angeles airport after he was found wearing a bulletproof vest, carrying a smoke grenade, and having items such as body bags, a biohazard suit and leg irons in his checked luggage. What struck me was this passage:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Department of Homeland Security has said [the accused] had no criminal record and no derogatory national-security record.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>What is a \"derogatory national-security record\" as distinct from a \"criminal record\"? How does one compile such a record without committing any crimes? </p> <p>Upon reflection, and after asking around, it likely means that the person is not on any designated no fly or watch list \u2013 and, more accurately, that the person has not meaningfully opposed the US government and, especially, is not Muslim (the same way that \u2013 when an outbreak of mass violence occurs \u2013 initial news reports indicating that \"there is no evidence of terrorism\" really mean: \"the attacker does not appear to be Muslim\"). </p> <p>Whatever this term denotes, the fact that the US government keeps files on people who have never been charged with any crimes, let alone convicted of them, and then deems some of them to have \"derogatory national-security records\" is creepy indeed. Governments should not be surveilling and storing massive amounts of information about law-abiding citizens, and in free countries, by definition, they do not. But that is exactly what a surveillance state entails.</p> <p><strong>(4)</strong> On the fifth try, the New York Times finally has a real, independent, and worthwhile Public Editor, Margaret Sullivan.

  "<p>Mauritania's president, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, is in hospital in France after a bizarre incident in which he was shot in the stomach, apparently by mistake, by his own troops.</p> <p>Authorities in the west African nation, regarded as a key in the battle against al-Qaida in the region, insisted the shooting, which took place 25 miles outside the capital, was an accident.</p> <p>Before leaving for France the president appeared on state television from hospital in Mauritania. \"I want to calm all citizens,\" Abdel Aziz said. \"I want to reassure everyone about my state of health after this incident committed by error.\"</p> <p>The French government said Abdel Aziz had been admitted to the Percy-Clamart military hospital in Paris.</p> <p>Mauritanian sources said \"jumpy\" military guards at a checkpoint mistook Abdel Aziz, who was returning to the capital, Nouakchott, after a trip to the desert, for a security threat.</p> <p>\"Security forces have been on high alert for the last six days, jumpy, and were concerned that something might happen. Obviously this incident is very unfortunate,\" a diplomatic source told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"We believe the shooting was an accident,\" the source said. \"The situation has now returned to normal \u2013 the international airports are open, and the virtual lockdown imposed after the incident has now been lifted.\"</p> <p>The Mauritanian press reported the president spent more than eight hours at the military hospital in Nouakchott, where he was operated on by two doctors, and is being flown to France by a Moroccan air ambulance.</p> <p>Reports say the military and presidential guard worked together to protect the president during the medical procedure, amid scenes of chaos on the streets.</p> <p>The information minister, Hadi ould el-Mahjoub, said the president's injuries were not life threatening. \"He was lightly wounded. He was able to get down from the car and walk without difficulty on his arrival at the hospital.\"</p> <p>On Sunday morning, military checkpoints, which have been conducting routine searches and identity card checks around the capital for several weeks, were withdrawn.</p> <p>Despite apparent calm in the capital, with markets open and ministries functioning as usual, questions remained about the incident, following initial reports that the shooting was a foiled coup attempt.</p> <p>\"There have been disgruntled middle-ranking soldiers who have been dealt with very swiftly by the regime,\" said a senior military source.</p> <p>\"There are a lot of questions going around. The question security is asking is why didn't the soldiers manning the checkpoints know the presidential convoy was passing. The president is always very heavily protected, his security detail is excellent.\"</p> <p>Officials declined to comment on what happened to the soldiers at the checkpoint, or if anyone else in the convoy was hurt.</p> <p>The shooting comes amid months of turbulence for Mauritania, which neighbours northern Mali \u2013 where al-Qaida-linked groups control vast swaths of territory \u2013 and which has been the subject of explicit threats by extremist groups.</p> <p>Around 100,000 refugees from Mali have fled into Mauritania, which has a population of 3.5 million, placing additional strain on resources as the country struggles with a food crisis engulfing the Sahel region.</p> <p>The country is also facing internal upheaval, with growing dissatisfaction with Abdel Aziz, who seized power in a military coup in 2008 before winning presidential elections a year later. Nouakchott has been the scene of opposition marches in recent months, with some commentators describing calls for Abdel Aziz to resign signs of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/26/mauritania-overlooked-arab-spring\" title=\"\">Mauritanian Arab spring</a>.</p> <p>\"The official line is it was an accident but it's really not very clear at the moment what happened,\" a western diplomat said.</p>",
  "<p>Women beware! Across the political spectrum, a consensus has broken out on the joys of maternity leave. And now the latest twist to \"family-friendly\" law is to encourage fathers to share the leave, if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/12/parental-leave-fathers-year-off\" title=\"\">reports are to be trusted</a>, after about a month. That may suit the family-focused rhetoric of the political classes. But more shared leave will not solve the problems of the conveyor belt system on which many working mothers find themselves after the birth of their babies, entitled to a year's leave and a job to return to.</p> <p>Maternity payment, generous to begin with at 90% of average income, drops to \u00a3135 a week for 33 weeks. Back at work within the statutory year, earnings tend to decline comparative to those who have not been on leave. There's evidence to suggest that it can take up to 15 years after the birth of each child to get back to where they were. Some have to drop hours or move to part-time work or a less demanding job in order to cope with family as well as work. Over a lifetime's work, the story for many women in ordinary jobs will be of smaller earnings, missed pension contributions and downward professional mobility.</p> <p>Adding more leave for fathers to the rota may be good for the Treasury if a high-earning woman returns rapidly to work. But it adds to the difficulties for business. At a time of recession and job losses, employers will have double the uncertainty and the costs this brings to business: two potential employees to find cover for where previously there was one; two jobs to be kept open and benefits paid; two lots of replacement staff to be trained \u2013 then let go.</p> <p>The costs of this scheme may have been massaged by Nick Clegg to a \"manageable\" round figure reported as a mere \u00a38m start-up (and \u00a322m for the new IT system to prevent fraud). But the true cost will be to jobs and markets in a western labour market that continues to award more time off and more benefit for less work. The UK, like its EU neighbours, is pricing itself out of a global market for labour and goods: we pay ourselves too much and produce too little.</p> <p>So what's to be done? If business is to grow, the UK debate must move to the structural reform of the labour market. Where should the law stop and business begin? In the UK, cover for maternity leave for working women was introduced in 1911 and there's no reason why that should stop in a better system.</p> <p>But the real problem for many women is not just poorer lives they face after a year's leave; it's how to afford a career break to spend the early years with their children which many want (<a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com/blog/2012/09/07/money-worries-forcing-new-mums-back-to-work-early/\" title=\"\">75% in one recent poll</a>), a break followed by good training and a return to the labour market on equal terms \u2013 as happens now for female doctors and many lawyers.</p> <p>If that's to happen, we must return the national insurance system to William Beveridge's contributory principle without which (he judged) the welfare state could not work. Contribution in time of earning would provide income when earnings cease in a personal pot of entitlement. The Beveridge model must now be adapted to the longer lives \u2013 and working lives \u2013 people will lead. So, a five- or 10-year career break out of 40 working years is a relatively short and affordable break to be covered by a lifetime's contributions. For maternity benefit, the sum might not be huge, but a benefit based on contributions over such a period would be a start.</p> <p>Having a job and having a decent income can't come from the state. But what the state can do is to make it possible for business to flourish and people to earn. Our leaders need now to see through the PR, and the wishlists and soundbites in which they dress \"family-friendly legislation\". The reality is of an expensive and overbearing state, unfriendly to business, unfriendly to women.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Um.</strong> So I wasn't supposed to be doing this. We only decided to do this 10 minutes ago after I walked into the office five minutes late. And Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic have already negotiated their way through most of the first set quicker than you can say \"Sunday shambles at the Guardian\", with Murray having just broken and about to serve for the set at 6-5 up. The break was greeted with much racket-smashing by Djokovic, but that's about all I can tell you. So excuse the lack of formalities/preamble. And please go easy on me/us. It is Sunday morning after all ...</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Before Murray serves for the first set, there's still just about enough time to say Britain's really rather good at tennis.</strong> News on Heather Watson's win at the Japan Open is here \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/heather-watson-wins-japan-open-tennis\">the first WTA singles title for a British woman since 1988</a>. Hopefully news of a second British win will follow ...</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Murray wins the first set 7-5!</strong><br>Ace, 15-0. Djokovic nets a backhand, 30-0. 30-15. Unreturned serve, 40-15, to bring up the <strong>double set point</strong>. Djokovic saves the first by pinging an unstoppable backhand down the line, the pair duke it out from the back of the court on the second and the error eventually comes from Djokovic! A short forehand at net goes well wide. Murray takes the first set in an hour and 14 minutes. The Sky commentators are saying it was a first-class set of tennis. I'll have to take their word for it. And an email. \"Hooray!\" cheers Siobhan Cavanagh. \"I've just been swearing loudly at the bloody Guardian for covering the semi-final and not the final. One thing you can say for us liberal pinkos \u2013 we pull it together in the end.\"</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 7-5, 0-1 Djokovic (*denotes next server)</strong><br>A little bit of court sweeping there in the break, just to get rid of the remaining pieces of Djokovic's smashed racket. So what response from the Serb, in this the first meeting between the pair since Murray finally shook that Fred Perry-sized monkey off his back in the US Open final 33 days ago? The red mist seems to have gone for Djokovic, as he holds comfortably, to 15.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 7-5, 1-1 Djokovic* </strong><br>Murray, by the way, is trying to win the Shanghai Masters title for a third straight year. There's a sniff of danger for him at 0-30, but some big serves get him out of trouble. 30-all. Another brings up game point, 40-30. And <em>another</em> out wide gives him the game. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack. \"They should have tournament when the players are as hungover as i am right now,\" says Ross Rawley. \"I would pay top dosh to see that.\" Not a bad idea Ross \u2013 though considering Murray is teetotal you may have to spike Murray's drink first. And perhaps you could slip Djokovic a big dose of gluten too, just to make it a level playing field?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 7-5, 1-2 Djokovic</strong><br>A wonderful game of cat and mouse on the first point, with some slicing and dicing and drop shots and lobs and top defence from both players. But eventually Murray, on the back foot and slightly off-balance, blinks on the backhand. 15-0. And Djokovic comes through to hold to 15.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 7-5, 2-2 Djokovic* </strong><br>Murray's serving is mightily impressive here. A couple more Exocets and a few stray Djokovic returns secure a regulation hold. And want some Heather Watson quotes after her win earlier? Sure you do:</p> <blockquote> <p>I was in the changing room afterwards, changing my clothes, and I thought to myself, 'Did I really win?' So it's just starting to settle in. I've worked so hard for this moment my whole career \u2013 that's why I practiced so hard, ran all those miles and lifted all those weights, for moments like this. Britain has been breaking quite a few records recently, so I'm happy I could break another one today. I'm proud to do this for my country. I was already thinking about how I was going to cry in the locker room! [when she faced four match points against her] But after I saved the first one, I just took it point by point. I'm really proud of myself for getting through that.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 7-5, 2-3 Djokovic </strong><br>There's not much giving on the Djokovic serve right now either. Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce, 15-0. Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce, 30-0. Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce, 40-0. Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce, 40-15. Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce, game, as Djokovic steps into the court to finish things off with a vicious cross-court forehand strike.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 7-5, 3-3 Djokovic* </strong><br>Some Murray murmurings at 30-15, after he nets: \"WHY? WHY? WHY?\" His monologue seems to do the job as he get to 40-15, but then double faults. Cue more mutterings. It does the trick again, as he sends an ace down the T, before swatting the spare ball in his pocket back to Djokovic's end with disdain. Back to you, Nole ...</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 7-5, 4-3 Djokovic </strong><br>A chance for Murray at 15-30. The two send each other back and forth and left and right on the next point, and Djokovic flunks a backhand into the net! Incredible movement from Murray. <strong>15-40, the first break points of the second set</strong>. Murray needs just the one, as Djokovic scampers forward but can only net a forehand volley under extreme pressure.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 7-5, 5-3 Djokovic* </strong><br>Djokovic has Murray on a piece of string at 15-0, and after dragging him back and forth Murray eventually makes the error. 15-all. Murray throws in a couple of short balls on the next exchange, but Djokovic can't take advantage. 30-15. Unreturned serve, 40-15. And another missile out wide sees Djokovic loop long, leaving Djokovic needing to hold serve to stay in the match ...</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 7-5, 5-4 Djokovic </strong><br>\"Watching these two guys play is to know the meaning of the phrase \"war of attrition\"!\" says Abhay Phadnis. \"I like the \"bounce, bounce...\" to describe Djokovic's service game - that ball does indeed seem to bounce interminably!\" Speaking of that Abhay ... cometh the crucial moments, cometh some even longer Djokovic ball bouncing. It does the trick though, the highlight at 30-15 a drop volley from the Serb at full stretch. Lovely stuff. Djokovic holds to 15, so Murray will serve for the title.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 7-5, 5-5 Djokovic* </strong><br>Djokovic appeals to Hawk-Eye on the first point, but he needn't have bothered. 15-0. Murray lassos a lethal forehand, which draws the Djokovic error. 30-0. A beautiful lob from Murray and a back-tracking Djokovic pulls off a between-the-legs shot, and the Serb eventually prevails after using every trick in the book, finishing things off with a drop shot and a raised first and grin. He's still smiling. 30-15. And now he seems inspired. Some brutal hitting and it's 30-all. Another fantastic point and it's Murray who prevails,<strong> 40-30, match point. </strong> But Murray goes short and Djokovic pounces. Deuce. Djokovic takes the paint off the baseline on the next point \u2013 brave, brave hitting \u2013 <strong>and it's advantage Djokovic, break point.</strong> Murray overcooks a loose forehand and there's the break. This one hasn't finished yet ...</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Second set: *Murray 7-5, 5-6 Djokovic </strong><br>Now it's Murray's turn to throw this racket around, but unlike Djokovic, he stops short of smashing it. Djokovic, inspired after saving that championship point, holds to 15, while Murray, rattled, needs to regroup. And fast. The Shanghai patrons are shouting \"\"Novak, Novak.\" They want a third set.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray 7-5, 6-6 Djokovic</strong><br>15-0. 30-0. Djokovic, as if to give himself a bit more energy, skips back to the deuce court. He needs that extra energy on the next point, as Murray has him scampering all over the shop. Djokovic is again forced into a between-the-legs shot, but this time, it doesn't come off. 40-0. 40-15. Game. It's tie-break time.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 0-1 Djokovic</strong><br>A Djokovic ace ...</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 0-2 Djokovic</strong><br>The first mini-break as Murray flunks a backhand into the net ...</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 1-2 Djokovic*</strong><br>But Murray sends down a strong serve to get on the board ...</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 1-3 Djokovic*</strong><br>After a cagey start by both players in the rally, Murray attempts to pull the trigger but misfires on the forehand ...</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 2-3 Djokovic</strong><br>But Djokovic, who's struggling to get his first serves in at the moment, doubles! We're back on serve ...</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 3-3 Djokovic</strong><br>A stray forehand from Djokovic and they're all square as they change ends ...</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 3-4 Djokovic*</strong><br>The pair trade cross-court missiles before Murray mixes things up with a lob, and Djokovic calmy dispatches a drop volley. Advantage Djokovic once more ...</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 4-4 Djokovic*</strong><br>But Djokovic can't take advantage of the advantage, as he makes the error ...</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 5-4 Djokovic</strong><br>Murray pounces on the second serve with a brutal backhand down the line, and he's got two serves for the title ...</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 6-4 Djokovic</strong><br>A quite incredible point, Djokovic throws everything but the kitchen sink at Murray, but it all comes back. Murray has two championship points ...</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 6-5 Djokovic*</strong><br>Murray appeals to Hawk-Eye after his first serve it called out, nothing giving. The second serve goes in, another lengthy exchange ensues, and this time Djokovic unleashes a vicious inside-out forehand ...</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 6-6 Djokovic*</strong><br>Murray nets. And shouts. That's three championship points that have been and gone now ...</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 6-7 Djokovic</strong><br>How superhuman is Djokovic in these big moments? It's now set point to the Serb ...</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 7-7 Djokovic</strong><br>Now it's Murray's turn to indulge in some lengthy ball-bouncing. He then rushes to the net and the pressure draws the Djokovic error. Phew.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 8-7 Djokovic*</strong><br>Djokovic's return is called out. But it wasn't. They'll replay the point. This time Djokovic attempts a backhand pass down the line, but it never looked like dropping in. So Murray has a third championship point in this breaker, and a fourth overall ...</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 8-8 Djokovic*</strong><br>Again, <em>absolutely nerveless</em> from Djokovic as he pings a winner past a stranded Murray ...</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 8-9 Djokovic</strong><br>And an unforced error from Murray hands Djokovic set point ...</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 9-9 Djokovic</strong><br>But you can guess what happens, right? We're all square again. This has echoes of the tie-break they duked out in New York. That ended 12-10 in Murray's favour. More of the same today, please ...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 10-9 Djokovic*</strong><br>Once again, Murray is a point away ...</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 10-10 Djokovic*</strong><br>Djokovic nets the first serve. Murray looks to have the initiative after Djokovic sends down his second serve, but Djokovic turns defence into attack and we're all square. Again.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 10-11 Djokovic</strong><br>Now it's set point Djokovic. And I must confess I'm regretting deciding to do a point-by-point commentary on this tie-break ...</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: *Murray 11-11 Djokovic</strong><br>Now it's Murray's time to produce with his back against the wall ...</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Second set tie-break: Murray 11-12 Djokovic*</strong><br>To all the world it looks like Murray will bury the winner, but he misses! A fourth set point to Djokovic ...</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Djokovic wins the second-set tie-break 13-11!</strong><br>And it's fourth time lucky, as Djokovic whips away a forehand drive volley winner. <em>After Murray had five championship points.</em> Cue much jumping up and down from Djokovic, Serbian shouting and fist pumps. Just like the US Open final they contested last month, this one is going the distance ...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray 7-5, 6-7, 1-0 Djokovic*</strong><br>Phew. I could do with a quick break, but no time for that. On to the final-set denouement. My colleague Rob Smyth has just emailed in, wondering whether there's ever been a sport where the elite standard is as high as it is in tennis right now. A very good question. The levels shown by the Top Four at the moment is nothing short of remarkable. It's not only the standard of their play, it's their superhuman athleticism and stamina as well. Murray holds comfortably, by the way, to get his name on the board first in the final set.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>Third set: *Murray 7-5, 6-7, 1-1 Djokovic</strong><br>Djokovic could do with finding a few more first serves, he's putting himself under a little more pressure than he'd like, but he squeezes through to 30. And a suggestion from Gwen James: \"As the Guardian messed you around when you got in, I vote for you doing all Andy Murray's finals live from now on - then you (and the bosses) can plan ahead.\" I like your logic Gwen. It would certainly make Sunday mornings slightly less stressful.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray 7-5, 6-7, 2-1 Djokovic*</strong><br>Now it's Murray's turn to flirt with a little danger. 40-30 quickly becomes deuce. But deuce turns into advantage Murray. And advantage turns into game. Murray skips back to his chair, decides it's time for a quick shirt change, and we're still on serve. The Proclaimers' 500 Miles is blasted around the stadium, which seems kind of appropriate considering the effort these two are putting in.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Third set: *Murray 7-5, 6-7, 2-2 Djokovic</strong><br>At 30-15, Murray's sliced backhand skids into the net. 40-15. Murray looks like he's got his eye in on Djokovic's serve, but he can't quite control the return, and that's the game. \"Wow. The standard of these guys continues to rise. What a couple of years we're in for,\" says @5livetennis on Twitter, to reinforce what Rob and I were saying a few games back.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray 7-5, 6-7, 3-2 Djokovic*</strong><br>A lengthy exchange at 30-15 has both players gasping for air \u2013 the length of their shots, pace and control quite remarkable after nearly three hours of play. Djokovic prevails, 30-all. The net cord then goes Djokovic's way, as Murray's forehand skips off the tape and flies wide. <strong>30-40, break point. </strong>A great second serve averts the danger, deuce. Cross-court blow after cross-court blow follows, Murray eventually lands a killer punch, leaving Djokovic on his derriere on the court. Advantage Murray. And he rattles off the next point to take the game.</p> <!-- Block 45 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g7kS68T6ptA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g7kS68T6ptA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Third set: *Murray 7-5, 6-7, 3-3 Djokovic</strong><br>Djokovic holds to 15, as Murray prods a backhand return long. A tired-looking shot. Djokovic uses the end of the game as an opportunity to stretch his legs out too. And a racket-smashing interlude, courtesy of James Lanman: \"Just seen a replay of Djokovic's racket pulverisation in slow motion \u2013 beautiful as it was I don't think <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7kS68T6ptA\">Baghdatis's slow, measured four-racket-in-a-row smash</a> at the Australian Open is ever likely to be beaten for overall drama \u2013 the way he works the crowd is brilliant, as ever.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray 7-5, 6-7, 3-4 Djokovic*</strong><br>Even if Djokovic's legs are a little heavy, he's still coming up with some probing and punishing shots on the forehand side. <strong>15-40, and it's two break points to Djokovic</strong>. A weary forehand into the net from Murray from mid-court and it's first blood to Djokovic in the decider. The Serb is ahead for the first time since the opening set. A careless service game that from Murray. \"Only seen one game \u2013 Murray surrendered serve sheepishly. Is it still 2011 is Shanghai?\" parps Gary Naylor.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>Third set: *Murray 7-5, 6-7, 3-5 Djokovic</strong><br>The 2012 Murray v2.0 is back, as he digs a volley out of his heels to go 15-30 ahead. Djokovic nods and claps appreciatively. A nice touch from Djokovic, and what touch Murray showed with that shot. But 15-30 soon becomes 30-all, which soon becomes 40-30, before Murray keeps himself in the game with a punishing return. Deuce. Advantage Djokovic. And an ace \u2013 only Djokovic's third of the day \u2013 secures the game. Murray will now serve to stay in the championship.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>Djokovic wins 5-7, 7-6, 6-3!</strong><br>From 15-all, Murray is left stranded by Djokovic's return. 15-30. A ridiculous drop shot from Murray, which didn't look like it would clear the net, somehow drops into court, before skidding viciously into the tramlines. 30-all. But Murray goes for broke on the next exchange, and it's <strong>30-40, Djokovic's first championship point </strong>\u2013 having saved those five against him. Djokovic nets the return, deuce. <strong>Advantage Djokovic, a second championship point.</strong> A lengthy, lengthy exchange ends with an inside-out forehand winner from Murray. Deuce. Advantage Murray. But no it's not, Djokovic appeals to Hawk-Eye and his return was in. They'll replay the point. <strong>And it's advantage Djokovic again.</strong> Murray goes high and wide and Djokovic comes back from the dead to win.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>So another astonishing match</strong> between these two friends and rivals, as Djokovic gains a measure of revenge for his defeat in the US Open final. He's now won seven of the nine Masters titles, and he continues to hunt down Federer in the battle to finish the year as the world No1. After Heather Watson saved four match points to win earlier, it was a case of those five missed match points for Murray. Yin and yang and all that. But British tennis is in rude health right now, as is the men's game. And it's only three weeks until the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 swing around. It should be a fantastic climax to the season. Thanks for your emails, see you later. Bye.</p>",
