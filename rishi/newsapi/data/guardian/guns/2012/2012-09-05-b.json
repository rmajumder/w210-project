  "<p>George Osborne has rebutted claims by former Barclays boss Bob Diamond that the bank was unfairly treated during a tax investigation by HM Revenue and Customs.</p> <p>In a letter likely to dent the bank's reputation further, the chancellor said Barclays was at fault and HMRC would have blocked the tax scheme had it come to light earlier.</p> <p>The Treasury rushed through legislation in the spring to close down two \"aggressive\" tax avoidance schemes Barclays disclosed to HMRC in an effort to avoid tax.</p> <p>Ministers said the bank, which at the time they refused to name, would face a fine of \u00a3500m after it embarked on a debt buy-back that HMRC said was designed solely to save tax.</p> <p>Diamond, who resigned after the Libor interest rate manipulation scandal came to light, told the Treasury select committee that Barclays was being treated unfairly because many other firms used the same avoidance scheme. He said the bank was being punished when it had come forward with details of its operation and tax savings.</p> <p>Osborne wrote to the committee, saying that Barclays was the only major corporation found using the complex scheme.</p> <p>\"It has been suggested that HMRC was aware of other companies that had used a similar approach for debt buy-backs. HMRC tells me that this is not right. HMRC has not been able to identify any arrangements similar to those put in place by Barclays, nor has any tax adviser or other company identified any such arrangements and HMRC would challenge anything that came to light,\" he said.</p> <p>He denied the bank was treated harshly, saying it was the first opportunity to block a newly identified avoidance scheme.</p> <p>Tory MP and TSC chairman Andrew Tyrie said it is regrettable that any company is fined retrospectively. He said it was necessary to simplify the tax system to limit the opportunities for companies to seek out loopholes.</p>",
  "<p>Turn the clock back three-and-a-half years. It is early 2009 and the world economy is in freefall. The shock waves from the collapse of Lehman Brothers are still reverberating and the economic indicators - trade, industrial production, unemployment - are comparable to the early stages of the Great Depression in the early 1930s.</p> <p>Central banks have slashed interest rates to the bone and finance ministries have allowed budget deficits to widen. Yet policymakers believe more is needed to arrest the slump and so they delve into the history books to come up with something known as quantitative easing. The Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England decide that they will buy large quantities of bonds from the financial markets to supplement the boost to activity provided by cuts in short-term interest rates.</p> <p>QE is designed to be a double-whammy. Firstly, the price of a bond moves inversely to the yield (interest rate) that it generates. Taking bonds out of the market reduces supply and pushes up the price. The interest rate comes down, making long-term borrowing cheaper for companies and householders with fixed-rate mortgages. Secondly, the institutions that hand over their bonds to the central banks get money in return, and they can use this to buy other assets such as shares. Rising equity prices help to restore business and consumer confidence.</p> <p>In one important respect, QE did the trick, because without it there is no telling what would have happened to the global economy in the winter of 2008-09. By the summer of 2009 there was clear evidence that the decline in output had bottomed out. Fears of a Great Depression 2 were scotched.</p> <p>And yet, QE was supposed to be a temporary measure, with the process reversed once the global economy returned to normal. Far from that happening, central banks kept on buying bonds. The Bank of England is on its fourth round of QE; the Fed is about to embark on its third. Despite an unprecedented stimulus, the global economy is losing momentum.</p> <p>Some argue that the harmful side-effects of QE are partly to blame for this, since the money created by bond buying has led to speculation in commodity markets, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/02/era-of-cheap-food-over\" title=\"\">driving up the price of food and fuel</a>, and hence hitting the spending power of consumers. Others wonder whether QE is now bumping up against the law of diminishing returns, with each round of bond buying less effective than the last. Certainly, if QE does not work soon then more radical measures - such as so-called drops of \"helicopter money\" on to the economy - will be canvassed.</p>",
  "<p>Ivan Glasenberg, take note, this is how you execute an all-share merger: prove yourself in the public markets as a reliable operator whose share price rises steadily for a decade; wait until your prey announces an embarrassing product recall; then pounce at a moment when the shareholders in that company would welcome the injection of a new chief executive.</p> <p>This is Irn-Bru maker AG Barr's formula for combining with the much larger, but more sluggish, Britvic. Very impressive too \u2013 AG Barr chief Roger White has played his hand skillfully. His investors will have 37% of the combo, which is an accurate reflection of the two companies' stock market standings but is a big overachievement for the Scots on other measures, especially turnover. But Britvic's investors are in no mood to complain: their share price rose 12% versus Barr's 8%.</p> <p>\"Compelling industrial logic\" sounds like bad news for somebody's head office (probably Barr's) but you know what the two sides mean. In the drinks game, there have traditionally been large savings when distribution systems and buying clout are combined. Just ask Diageo, which reaped a rich harvest after Guinness and Grand Metropolitan merged in 1997. Barrvic, or whatever it will be called, can play out the same script in miniature. It will even have Gerald Corbett, GrandMet finance director in those days and Britvic chairman now, heading the board.</p> <p>Has Corbett short-changed his shareholders? Probably not. After the Fruit Shoot recall, Britvic shareholders wanted to see signs of life and the Barr merger qualifies. It's not as if Corbett had a free hand to explore alternative deals. Britvic bottles Pepsi under licence in the UK and Ireland and PepsiCo can veto a change of control \u2013 it would probably object to, say, a private equity owner. Moreover, if PepsiCo itself was interested in buying Britvic it surely would have done so years ago. This is a deal that looks like that rare thing: an all-share merger where nobody is unhappy. Under-fire Britvic chief executive Paul Moody even gets a quiet exit.</p>",
  "<p>England may well have won 12 of their past 14 one-day internationals but the absurdity of the ODI rankings was well illustrated under the Trent Bridge lights when their retention of top spot was marked by a batting display as inept as any they can have managed. A target of 183 provided no challenge for South Africa, who lost three early wickets in their pursuit but were then carried home with 93 deliveries to spare by an unbroken 172-run partnership between Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers.</p> <p>The winning runs, clipped to the square- leg boundary by Amla in a manner we appear to have been watching ceaselessly all summer, took him to 97 from 107 balls, which amounts to 335 runs for the series, and, along with 482 in the preceding Tests, a total of 817 runs in all, at an average of 116.71: there are three Twenty20 matches to come. He is a remarkable batsman, unquestionably not just player of the series but of the summer. De Villiers finished with 75 from 79 balls. The series, therefore, finishes all square at two matches each with the first match a washout.</p> <p>Alastair Cook's bowlers, led by Jimmy Anderson and showing an intensity and desire lacking in their fancy-dan batting confreres, fought tooth and claw to pull the match round after the England innings had collapsed in a display of profligate ill-judged strokes that must carry gift aid.</p> <p>There is always some movement in the air at Trent Bridge and using two white balls, one from each end, has the additional effect of sustaining the swing for longer. But that is small excuse for the dismal nature of the England batting against bowling that, with the exception of Dale Steyn, who was magnificent, was hardly challenging and at times could scarcely believe its luck. To make only 182 on a glorious late summer's afternoon was almost a dereliction of duty: to do so with almost five overs unused was so bad that the bottom of the memory barrel has to be scraped to try to find a performance to match it.</p> <p>The manner of England's response in the field came as no surprise. It is the nature of bowlers to view batsmen as high-maintenance poseurs from whom they require only that they provide sufficient runs for them to be able to do their job properly and beyond that ask no more than they spend enough time in the middle for them to remove their boots and put the feet up for an hour or so.</p> <p>Jade Dernbach had Graeme Smith caught at second slip by James Tredwell. Anderson then produced two magnificent maiden overs in which he tormented Faff du Plessis and Dean Elgar, inexperienced players, before finding the edge of both bats in the space of eight deliveries, to leave South Africa floundering at 14 for three. It flattered to deceive as gradually the brilliant Amla, and De Villiers, arguably the best all-formats batsman in the world, took control aggressively and emphatically. England fielded well but it was a chanceless display from the batting pair.</p> <p>Maybe the England batting performance was an accident waiting to happen for there was an end-of-term feel to it. Andy Flower, the team director, had decided to take a rare brief break away from the team (although it would be in character if he had spent it watching the game on television), leaving the fielding coach, Richard Halsall, in charge.</p> <p>There was already no Stuart Broad or Graeme Swann and to that pair could be added Jonathan Trott, whom a second MRI scan revealed had a fracture near the knuckle of his right hand that had been hit by Steyn during the match at Lord's, and Steven Finn, who was said to have a stiff back. To an extent, and it is hard to blame them England, in the wake of an onerous schedule, are protecting their assets leading into the World Twenty20 later in the month.</p> <p>None of this excuses the nature of the batting, so infuriating for the bowlers that Anderson, habitually a scrapper with the bat, slogged his second ball high into the air to be caught at mid-off as if in an almighty strop. It began with Ian Bell, who has made an excellent job of opening the batting but here, advised presumably by Cook, wasted England's only DRS review in querying a plumb lbw.</p> <p>Ravi Bopara's fluctuating fortunes continued with a second-ball nought, his second duck in four innings after averaging 91 against Australia. There then followed a 55-run stand between Cook and Jonny Bairstow, in for Trott, before in quick succession Bairstow nonchalantly flicked Morne Morkel to deep midwicket and Eoin Morgan heaved his second ball to mid-on.</p> <p>Cook completed an unobtrusive but efficient half-century, from 69 balls, but instead of batting through promptly chipped a gentle full toss back to Du&#xa0;Plessis. When a slow bouncer from Steyn took Samit Patel's glove, England were 124 for six and deep in trouble. That they escaped as they did was down to Craig Kieswetter, who made 33 before skying to mid-off during the batting power play, and Chris Woakes, who would have appreciated more resilience at the other end and was left unbeaten, also on 33.</p>",
  "<p>Lord Krebs, president-elect of the British Science Association, says the government's attempts to use fashionable \"nudge\" tactics to influence the public's behaviour should not be seen as a replacement for more traditional approaches to changing society for the greater good.</p> <p>In 2010, the coalition government set up the <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/behavioural-insights-team\">Behavioural Insights Team</a>, also known as the \"nudge unit\". Headed by David Halpern, it is exploring the possibility of using behavioural psychology techniques to influence individuals' decisions.</p> <p>The idea is to change behaviour by altering the way choices are presented to people, as espoused in Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein's book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9780141040011/nudge-improving-decisions-about-health-wealth-and-happiness\">Nudge</a>. For example, instead of sending generic reminder letters to car owners to renew their vehicle licence, a personalised letter that includes an image of the unlicensed car is sent. This results in a 33% increase in the number of people renewing licences.</p> <p>Speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/BritishScienceFestival/\">British Science Festival in Aberdeen</a>, where he will give his presidential address on Thursday on the topic, Krebs accepted that nudge tactics did result in behavioural changes. However, although he is heartened that the nudge unit is setting up randomised control trials to test its approach scientifically, he sees its potential uses as limited.</p> <p>Asked whether this aspect of behavioural science could help solve society's big problems, Krebs said: \"Yes and no. Insights can help us, to some degree but no, they're not the alternative to other approaches. They're not a kind of get out of jail card if the government wants to avoid tougher approaches like taxation and regulation. It's got be to a mixture of things, including regulation and financial incentives.\"</p>",
  "<p>New Jersey's attorney general has assured a group of Muslim leaders that a New York police department unit that conducted surveillance of Muslims is no longer operating in the state.</p> <p>A spokesman for attorney general Jeffrey Chiesa confirmed that Chiesa told a private meeting of New Jersey law enforcement officials and Muslim leaders Wednesday that the NYPD's demographics unit had ceased operating in New Jersey.</p> <p>The NYPD's covert surveillance program faced scrutiny after an investigation by the Associated Press beginning in August of last year detailed the extent of the operations. </p> <p>Following September 11, with the help of the CIA, the NYPD's counterterrorism surveillance efforts included spying on Muslim neighborhoods, infiltrating Muslim-owned businesses and cataloging mosques in the north-east. </p> <p>The demographics unit gathered information on people based on their language and ethnicity, though there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the individuals. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/22/nypd-surveillance-muslim-student-groups\">Muslim college students</a> at more than a dozen colleges in the north-east US were a particular focus of the program which would monitor Muslim students' websites on a daily basis and monitored Muslim student associations. </p> <p>New Jersey governor Chris Christie criticized the police department's operations in the state as did Newark mayor Cory Booker who said <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/22/nypd-surveillance-muslim-student-groups\">in February</a> that he didn't know about the program that mapped and photographed 16 mosques in Newark and profiled several restaurants. </p> <p>The NYPD has defended its surveillance of Muslims in New Jersey as legal, and Chiesa has said New York police did not violate New Jersey laws.</p> <p>NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly, who has defended the program, said Wednesday he wasn't aware of the New Jersey meeting.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/nypd-secret-muslim-spying-no-leads\">In late August</a>, the police department acknowledged that the secret demographics unit did not generate a lead or case in the six years the program has been in place.</p>",
  "<p>\"Did you see that hit?\" crowed the commentator to 12,000 baying spectators. It had taken six minutes for the first sickening crunch, when the British captain Steve Brown was flipped over in his wheelchair by his American opponent, Derrick Helton.</p> <p>The British wheelchair rugby team could be forgiven for having had enough of sickening crunches in their lives: three were disabled in car accidents, two while playing rugby and two more in swimming pool accidents. But in murderball, perhaps the most eagerly awaited competition of the Paralympics, the smash of colliding wheelchairs is not just within the rules, it is fetishised by players and fans.</p> <p>\"Where else can you knock people out of wheelchairs legally?\" exclaimed Aaron Phipps, the goal-scoring star of Britain's opening match against the USA, which ended in victory for the American favourites, who won gold in Beijing.</p> <p>Billed as the mutant child of basketball, ice hockey and rugby \u2013 in wheelchairs \u2013 murderball at first looks more like banger racing, with dangerously pimped-up wheelchairs bristling with protuberant metal cages and bumpers designed to upend rivals.</p> <p>But as the British players variously explained afterwards, it is actually deeply tactical, more like \"chess with violence\" or \"chess with hitting\" or \"that wizard chess in Harry Potter\".</p> <p>The Potter analogy was made by the new boy-wonder of the boisterous basketball arena, David Anthony. The 22-year-old from Neath sported a blue mohican and a punky disregard for politeness, barking at opponents and trying to punch the ball from their grasp, when not hurtling away to score 11 mostly spectacular solo goals.</p> <p>Able-bodied crowds cheering as disabled people knock themselves over, each \"hit\" celebrated with a blast of the Beastie Boys' Sabotage over the Tannoy, might not be everyone's definition of progress, but it didn't feel like voyeurism; just a fast, violent sport played by those with a flippant attitude towards being flipped over that was beyond the ken of mere mortals.</p> <p>For all the collisions and \"going mental\" as Phipps put it, much of the players' energy is taken up with dexterous swivelling to find space as the ball is thrown between players who then seek to wheel it to the opposition goal line. As if the game needed speeding up, no player can hold the ball longer than 10 seconds and a team concedes possession if they don't score in 40 seconds. The British roared away 13-11 in the first quarter as the USA seemed stunned by the partisan crowd and the aggression and pace of Brown and Phipps.</p> <p>Phipps stood out in the British team, but he had to: each player gets a points rating according to disability and no team must have more than eight points on the pitch. As Britain's 3.5 player Phipps had to make a big contribution.</p> <p>By contrast, the USA fielded a more balanced team of four 2.0 players for much of the match, including Nick Springer, a quadruple amputee who caught the ball and propelled his chair at high speed with his elbows.</p> <p>Sportingly, none of the players would reveal the precise on-pitch sledging between the British \u2013 who just missed out on a bronze medal by finishing fourth in Athens and Beijing \u2013 and the Americans, who are the current Paralympic and world champions.</p> <p>\"They tried [to intimidate us] but they failed,\" said Ross Morrison, who suffered spinal cord injuries after breaking his neck, aged 16, playing rugby. In one exchange Phipps was knocked over at full tilt, and as he struggled on the ground Chuck Aoki, the canny leading American scorer with 14 goals, wheeled over to scream \"wanker\" in his face. The USA won the battle of the tumbles, throwing British players over three times to their players being sent flying twice.</p> <p>After a shaky first quarter the Americans took control of the match, and despite a British fight back, the USA ran out comfortable 56-44 winners. The British players were happy with their performance but must now get out of a tough group containing France and Japan.</p> <p>\"That was a tough game, it was a rough game,\" said Anthony after the match. But the constant sledging was simply \"a little friendly banter\" and \"off the court we're all friends again\".</p> <p>Such X-rated clashes are not men only: murderball is a mixed sport and Britain's Kylie Grimes, one of only two women players at the Paralympics, entered the fray in the final quarter. The 24-year-old, paralysed from the neck down after jumping into a swimming pool at a party, performed some useful blocks but was repeatedly bashed by the American captain, Will Groulx.</p> <p>\"It's how it should be. If I'm playing the sport I don't want to be treated any differently,\" she said after the match.</p> <p>\"She doesn't need looking after,\" said Anthony. \"Kylie is an amazing player.\"</p> <p>To talk about bravery is a Paralympic clich\u00e9 but just as it is mistakenly believed the Inuit have hundreds of words for snow, so we really must find more ways of describing these athletes' casual absence of bother when getting severely bashed by aluminium chariots.</p> <p>The players certainly revel in the adrenalin, the knocks and the notoriety.</p> <p>\"It's the glamour sport,\" as the British player Myles Pearson \u2013 sent flying by one crunching challenge \u2013 put it. \"We are the rock stars of the Paralympics.\"</p>",
  "<p>The powerhouse of the government, the Treasury, is without a female minister for the first time in at least 16 years, as it deals with the biggest economic recession since the second world war.</p> <p>The decision to move the economic secretary, Chloe Smith, to international development and appoint a raft of new men to the ministerial team under George Osborne was strongly criticised on Wednesday night by the shadow leader of the house and former Treasury minister Angela Eagle.</p> <p>\"If there's no female minister there, there's very little chance of women's perspectives on spending being taken account of,\" said Eagle. \"Public spending is so skewed towards matters that are really important to women that having a woman at the Treasury to make those points where there's the most power in government is really important.\"</p> <p>David Cameron continued his reshuffle on Wednesday, with six appointments to the cabinet and four sackings, and appointing a group of ministers below cabinet level.</p> <p>In total 29 ministers were sacked or asked to return to the frontbenches in the reshuffle. Sir George Young, who lost his job as Leader of the House, is to be made a Companion of Honour while other departing ministers \u2013 James Paice, Edward Garnier, Nick Harvey and Gerald Howarth \u2013 will receive knighthoods. <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/09/how-cameron-made-ministers-cry/\" title=\"\">The Spectator reports</a> on Thursday that three of the demoted ministers cried when they were told the news. Lady Warsi, pictured, was reported to be so cross about being stripped of the party chairmanship that she went home to Yorkshire and carried on negotiations from there.</p> <p>The influx of at least 14 of the 2010 intake of MPs, including four women and two non-white MPs as junior ministers \u2013 Sajid Javid and Helen Grant \u2013 will go some way to addressing concerns that both groups in the cabinet had become less represented.</p> <p>Cameron also appointed a black MP, Sam Gyimah, his parliamentary private secretary; and more women were moved into the whips office by both parties. The Liberal Democrat's promoted two women ministers.</p> <p>The new ministers with responsibilities for the environment \u2013 Nick Boles to planning and John Hayes to energy \u2013 added to concerns the new government would take an even less green line on key policies: Boles called the National Trust \"latter-day Luddites\" for objecting to building on greenbelt land; and Hayes has a deep concern about wind energy.</p> <p>A Lib Dem source vowed they would not let the new appointments change the government's course, pointing out that policies on energy and climate change were detailed in the coalition agreement and set in law. The source said: \"We have got the coalition agreement and legally binding targets and while we are in government those two things stand.\"</p> <p>Other appointments that raised eyebrows were Greg Knight's move to the whips office, despite having rebelled eight times in two years; and former Labour deputy leader John Prescott claimed on Twitter that the new team under education secretary Michael Gove was \"86%\" educated at private school \u2013 while Gove went to a state school before winning a scholarship to an independent private school.</p> <p>The promotion of Jo Johnson, one of the 2010 intake, from a PPS to the whips office was also welcomed as an astute move: the MP is the brother of London mayor Boris Johnson, who is increasingly the biggest thorn in the side of the prime minister, and has claimed much airtime over the last two days with his strident opposition to the government's apparent move towards a U-turn on its pledge not to expand Heathrow.</p> <p>Another late announcement was the promotion of Hugh Robertson \u2013 credited with much of the success of the government's handling of the Olympics and Paralympics \u2013 from a junior to a middle-ranking role at the department for culture, media and sport. Lord Ashcroft, who in the past has donated millions of pounds to the party, was appointed veterans' tsar.</p> <p>Despite the promotion of new women, the ministerial line-up was still dominated by men: there are five women out of 31 attending cabinet and, by late afternoon on Wednesday, eight women out of the 44 newly appointed ministers, resulting in fewer than one-in-six women in government. In fewer than three years, Cameron has said the number should be one-third.</p> <p>With the enlarged cabinet having tilted the bias slightly to the south, the picture continues lower down in government, where 13 MPs represent constituencies in the north and Wales (approximately Birmingham and above on the map), compared to 29 with seats in the south.</p> <h2>Appointed on Wednesday</h2> <p><strong>Tom Brake</strong></p> <p>Deputy leader of the House</p> <p><strong>Hugh Robertson </strong></p> <p>Minister of state in culture department</p> <p><strong>Lady Randerson </strong></p> <p>Junior minister in the Wales Office</p> <p><strong>Don Foster </strong> Junior minister for local government</p> <p><strong>Mark Simmonds</strong> Junior minister in the Foreign Office</p> <p><strong>Lynne Featherstone</strong> Junior minister in the Department for International Development</p> <p><strong>Brandon Lewis</strong> Junior minister for local government</p> <p><strong>Jo Swinson </strong> Junior minister in business department</p> <p><strong>Lord Marland</strong> Junior minister in business department</p> <p><strong>Andrew Murrison</strong> Junior defence minister</p> <p><strong>Edward Timpson </strong> Junior minister in Department for Education</p> <p><strong>Stephen Crabb</strong> Lord commissioner in the Treasury and junior minister in the Wales Office</p> <p><strong>Nick Boles</strong> Junior minister for planning</p> <p><strong>Greg Knight, Jo Johnson, Nicky Morgan</strong> and <strong>Desmond Swayne</strong> were appointed government whips</p>",
  "<p>The world has been in financial crisis since 2008 and I have always wondered why no really drastic measures (such as splitting retail from investment banking or introducing a financial transaction tax) have been taken to rein in the banks and finance industry (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/04/osborne-failed-battle-for-alternative?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Osborne's failed</a>, Comment, 5 September).

  "<p>Almost 20 years ago to the day, Sarah Storey recalls, she was the \"new, young\" member of the British Paralympic squad who had just won&#xa0;her first gold medal, and was somewhat in awe of the all-conquering Tanni Grey.</p> <p>On Thursday Storey \u2013 now 34, not 14, and a cyclist rather than a swimmer \u2013 could equal the mark of 11 gold medals held by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson.</p> <p>\"Just to be anywhere near Tanni is incredible,\" said Storey after a triumph in the women's C5 road time trial at the Brands Hatch circuit, her third gold of London 2012 and her fifth in all on the bike.</p> <p>There were four British time trial medals on the day: Storey's gold, silvers for Mark Colbourne in the C1 class and Karen Darke in the H1-2 handcycle event, and a bronze for David Stone in the T1-2 trike equivalent.</p> <p>Storey said: \"I can't believe I'm being put on the same page as her. Tanni's a good friend and an incredible athlete and such a lovely girl. Just to be even spoken about her in same breath is an incredible honour.\"</p> <p>Grey-Thompson is not the most decorated British Paralympian \u2013 Mike Kenny, a swimmer, won 16 golds between 1976 and 1988 \u2013 but she is the mark against which all her modern equivalents seem to be measured.</p> <p>Already at these Games the previously unbeatable dressage rider Lee Pearson has stumbled in his widely anticipated tilt at an 11th or 12th gold. While Storey's final event is the road race, and as such prone to more tactical vagaries and random mishaps than timed road or track events, few would bet against the Cheshire native gaining gold No11.</p> <p>The 10th was secured in imperious fashion, by almost a minute and a half over the silver medallist, Poland's Anna Harkowska, in an event that lasted a shade over 20 minutes.</p> <p>Storey said she was desperate for success on the road after two titles in the velodrome: \"This has been where all my preparation's been done, so I really need to nail this one here today, and obviously having watched the success of the Olympic team on the road and Bradley [Wiggins] winning the time trial, and Chris Froome getting the bronze medal, I just wanted to make sure I added my name to that list of&#xa0;success.\"</p> <p>She has now matched she five golds collected in the pool from 1992 to 2004 in just two Games since changing sports to combat persistent ear problems. Storey said her background made her a better all-round athlete: \"The discipline swimming has given me has allowed me to train on my own for hours. That discipline of just being up early and training constantly by yourself is something you can't replace. I'm so glad I was a swimmer for as long as I was.\"</p> <p>Such is Storey's competitive nature that her first comment after finishing was that she wanted to check her time against the men's C5 race to \"see where I would have placed\". The answer \u2013 not a direct equivalent as Storey's 16km race amounted to two out of three laps for the men \u2013 was that she would have been eighth, more than two minutes quicker than her British team-mate Jon-Allan Butterworth.</p> <p>Poor Butterworth: winner of three silver medals on the velodrome, he was grazed and bandaged after a training crash the previous day, coming 13th out of 14 riders. The crash had an unusual cause, he said \u2013 a British tandem: \"Going down one of the descents I was on the racing line and got taken out by a tandem. It knocked my handlebars and I went down pretty heavily, about 50kmh, something like that.\"</p> <p>Butterworth diplomatically refused to name the riders involved, but only one tandem couple are racing in the time trials, Lora Turnham and her sighted pilot, Fiona Duncan. After two fourth places on the track they endured more heartbreak \u2013 the pair led on the first two laps before a mechanical problem halted them for more than a minute, pushing them down to sixth.</p> <p>Colbourne, 42, who only turned to cycling after a 2009 paragliding accident broke his back, missed out on gold by just 13 seconds despite the hilly circuit not suiting his impairment. He said: \"If you look at the course, with my disability \u2013 no hamstrings, no feet working, no glutes working \u2013 you put me on an 11% hill and it's like somebody takes my batteries out.\" He added: \"My legs are not my friends at the moment.\"</p> <p>In the handcycling, Rachel Morris could only come fifth in the H3 class, which she won in Beijing. But this was an achievement in itself given that just eight weeks ago she was struck by a car in training, suffering injuries she initially thought would force her to&#xa0;withdraw.</p> <p>In the H1-2 equivalent there was a silver for Darke, the 41-year-old British Paralympic debutant, who decided to take up the sport after watching the Beijing Games in bed following a sea kayaking accident.</p> <p>In the trike class, for those unable to balance a bike \u2013 for example because of cerebral palsy \u2013 the double Beijing gold medallist David Stone took bronze.</p> <p>Britain now has six cycling gold medals and 19 medals in all. Four of the golds and a silver have come from the Storey family, after Sarah's husband Barney piloted Neil Fachie in two tandem track races. If the Storeys were a&#xa0;nation, they would be 24th on the overall medal table, just above South&#xa0;Africa.</p> <p>Storey claimed ignorance of this: \"We'll leave the stats to you guys and look through the newspapers when we get home.\"</p>",
  "<p>A former secret envoy between the Irish government and the Ulster Volunteer Force is to meet with loyalist leaders later this week to help end the recent run of violence in north Belfast.</p> <p>Chris Hudson, the one-time mediator between Dublin and the UVF leading up to the terror group's 1994 ceasefire, is to hold talks in Northern Ireland aimed at defusing tensions within the loyalist movement.</p> <p>Rank and file UVF members have taken part in three days of violence at the Carlisle Circus-Lower Antrim Road sectarian interface since Sunday. Around 62 police officers have been injured in the riots sparked by a row over a republican parade in the area on Sunday afternoon. Loyalist rioters were behind most of the injuries the police sustained in the trouble.</p> <p>The Dublin trade unionist turned unitarian minister Hudson will hold discussions with UVF leaders later this week. Hudson has been a trusted go-between for the Irish government and the UVF since 1993 when he got involved in a covert back-channel between Dublin and the loyalist paramilitaries. He was awarded a series of international peace prizes and an MBE for his work in building links between the Republic and the loyalists.</p> <p>Hudson declined to go into detail about the latest talks but confirmed to the Guardian there would be discussions with the UVF in relation to the recent violence: \"I want to help in any way I can to help everyone including the UVF pull back from the brink. I seriously believe there is a willingness among the loyalists to defuse sectarian tensions.\"</p> <p>He said he would be travelling to Belfast later this week to meet his UVF contacts and explore ways of ending the violence.</p> <p>Within the UVF Hudson is regarded as a trustworthy point of contact with both the Irish and British governments, and republicans.</p> <p>The peace campaigner added: \"I accept what the police are saying that the UVF is not orchestrating this but there are foot soldiers getting involved in the violence. Those of us who are in positions of responsibility should be careful about the language we use in order not to raise the tensions in the area.\"</p> <p>Earlier Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness, Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers, united to condemn the violence in north Belfast but to also urge dialogue on all sides.</p> <p>Robinson denied he had avoided commenting on the violence and destruction stressing he simply wanted to avoid saying anything that could raise further tensions. The first minister said he was impressed that Catholic residents in the Carrick Hill area of the city had not demanded that Orange Order and other loyalist parades be re-routed away from St Patrick's chapel.</p> <p>The Catholic church in Belfast's Donegall Street was turned into a contentious parade route in July when loyalist bandsmen were captured playing a sectarian song outside its doors.</p> <p>A large number of loyalist bands and their supporters are scheduled to file past the church again on 29 September when thousands gather in the city to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Ulster Covenant opposing Home Rule. There are fears this event could degenerate into a major sectarian confrontation close to Belfast city centre.</p> <p>The deputy first minister described the scenes over the last 72 hours in north Belfast as \"deplorable, disgraceful and shameful\".</p> <p>McGuinness added: \"This is a time for leadership. This is a time for people to stand together against violence and particularly for the Loyal Orders to show leadership, and I think there's been a distinct lack of leadership from them over the course of recent times.\"</p> <p>The Sinn Fein MP said that while he had disagreements in the past with the body that adjudicates on contentious cultural and political marches, the Parades Commission, it was \"incumbent upon everybody, the loyal orders, politicians of all descriptions, to stand by the rule of law\".</p> <p>Police were pelted with fireworks and bricks in the Carlisle Circus area in the north of Belfast on Tuesday night, although the trouble was not on the scale of rioting that left more than 60 officers injured over the two previous evenings.</p>",
  "<p>Two things surprised me, the first time I saw Atos emblazoned all over the Paralympic Games: first, what a bizarre idea, for a company that is the single biggest identified threat to disabled people, to want to sponsor the event; second, what's in it for them? They already have incredible brand recognition. Anyone with even a passing interest will have heard wordplay (\"they couldn't give a tos\"). It is well known that the value of their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/28/atos-3bn-government-contracts-paralympics\" title=\"\">contracts from the UK government</a> currently stands at \u00a33bn. We know from <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/articles/britain-on-the-sick-clips\" title=\"\">Dispatches</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00wq21j\" title=\"\">Panorama</a> that Atos assessors are being given targets for removing people from the benefits \"support group\" \u2013 effectively, Christ-like, pronouncing them not disabled, in the hope that they will thereafter no longer be disabled.</p> <p>It doesn't appear to work \u2013 40% of people have appealed the decision, and 38% of those were successful. It's a mistake to infer that the rest were, therefore, caught bang to rights. Some of them simply give up, some die of their lack of illness, some take their own lives. The appeals process costs the government another \u00a350m, but that comes out of some other budget (it will probably be used, somewhere along the line, as an argument for legal aid being too expensive).</p> <p>There is no reason to suppose that a large number of disabled people are faking it. The <a href=\"http://statistics.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd2/index.php?page=fraud_error\" title=\"\">DWP's figures</a> give a preliminary estimate for 2011/12 of benefits overpayment through fraud and error at 2%, but wait: 0.8% is customer error, 0.5% is DWP error. Only 0.7% of claimants are fraudulent.</p> <p>On the subject of appeals, we know that you're more likely to be successful if you've got audio of the assessment. For \"security reasons\", Atos will not let claimants use their own recording equipment, and has purchased only 11 machines, to be split between 123 centres, to interview 11,000 people a week. At the last check, several machines were broken, but \"unfortunately\" assessments couldn't be postponed until they were mended.</p> <p>We know that Atos requires no mental&#xa0;health training from its assessors, has no specific test for the mentally ill, and takes no account of fluctuating conditions; so that's a discrimination case waiting to happen.</p> <p>Sorry to recap, when all of this has been established \u2013 but it underlines the puzzle. This is a company for whom scrutiny, indeed any kind of attention, can only lead to greater unpopularity. So why do they put themselves through it?</p> <p>Because it's part of the deal \u2013 they are not simply the government's henchmen. They are its flakcatchers.</p> <p>At a <a href=\"http://atosvictimsgroup.co.uk/2012/09/04/private-members-debate-from-11am-westminster-hall-4th-sep-2012-atos-healthcare-wca/\" title=\"\">public meeting in Westminster</a> Hall last night, various Labour MPs put questions about Atos to Chris Grayling; John McDonnell MP tweeted \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellMP/statuses/242947183119331328\" title=\"\">Protesters sum up exactly what this debate is all about. The Atos system is causing immense suffering &amp; killing people</a>.\" It's true but it's also wrong: all Atos does is enforce a government policy that causes immense suffering.</p> <p>People at the coalface of the work capability assessment already know this. Disability campaigners protest outside the DWP as much as Atos headquarters. Tony Smith, spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Uncut</a>, pointed out: \"Atos are doing the government's dirty work.\"</p> <p>Analyst Rachael Stormonth, of <a href=\"http://www.nelson-hall.com/\" title=\"\">NelsonHall</a>, calls Atos \"whipping boys\" for the government, which I quote not to make anyone feel sorry for them \u2013 rather to point out that the very visibility, the signposting of this firm's deficiencies, should wise us up to the fact that it's a diversionary tactic. There is nothing easier than to dislike a faceless foreign corporation with apparently no attachment to the people whose lives it wrecks. But they wouldn't do it if they weren't being paid to; all our ire should go to the people who are paying them. The spectacle of the minister appearing in public to defend a company of his own commission, which enforces policies of his own devising, is ludicrous.</p> <p>On the one hand this is an inevitable side-effect of outsourcing. When services go wrong having been contracted out, of course questions are going to be asked about the company that undertook them. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/24/london-2012-olympics-g4s-military\" title=\"\">Olympics security debacle was a G4S failure</a>; while there was debate about the nature of the contractual process, G4S remained the culprit.</p> <p>But what's interesting is that these failures are rewarded with more contracts. About \u00a3400m of Atos's contracts with the government were won last month, by which time the deficiencies of their work capability assessment had been widely flagged. G4S is apparently set to win \u00a32bn worth of contracts for five prisons, its recent shambles notwithstanding (this has yet to be announced: I hope I'm wrong. I bet I'm not) And welfare-to-work firm A4e&#xa0;was repeatedly awarded new contracts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/09/a4e-welfare-to-work-contract\" title=\"\">despite an abysmal record</a>. It looks like mismanagement from a distance, but the more often it happens the more obvious it becomes \u2013 this isn't an accident. These firms take the fall, and their reward is that they are lavishly paid to enforce other unpopular and/or ill-considered policies, for which they will again take the fall. It's the perfect division of labour, since the government needs popularity and will throw money at masking its unpopular decisions, while the firms care nothing for popularity and will hoover up the money.</p> <p>At root, this is an attempt to privatise our anger \u2013 take it out of the public domain, where it might mean something, and direct it towards the private sector, where it means nothing. The flaw in this calculation is that anger&#xa0;is a limitless resource. You might as well try to privatise air.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> I was ripped from my sleep at 7.27am this morning. Not sure why my alarm setting was so precise but there you go. It was a decent sleep, just under eight hours with only a couple of brief interruptions. My eyemask slipped off again; that always seems to happen. I'm not entirely sure what I dreamt about, but I think an ex and a Diesel shop were involved. Not diesel as in petrol; I wouldn't have used a capital letter had that been the case. I had some toast for breakfast (dry; I must remember to add Marmite to the list of things I must remember to buy) and then finished some work. I started to watch Clueless but got restless after 10 minutes so I replied to some emails before coming into the office.</p> <p>As those of you who have got this far without switching over to The Competition would surely concur, talking about No1 has a limited appeal. It's a lesson us cricket types should remember. Since England became inexplicably useful in all three formats of the game, every match has been framed in the context of being No1. When England hammered South Africa on Sunday, it was suggested by a few people that today's fifth and final ODI barely mattered because England would remain top of the rankings until the near year regardless of the result.</p> <p>In the parlance of our time, sod that! There is a series to be won here. England lead 2-1, and if they win/tie/no result today's match they will have won eight consecutive ODI series at home for the first time ever. The rankings are emphatically a good thing, but it's time we got back to the humble, self-contained joy of winning matches and winning series. Then \u2013 30 points in cricketclichebingo \u2013 the rankings will take care of themselves.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>England have won the toss and will bat first</strong></p> <p><strong>England</strong> Cook (capt), Bell, Bopara, Bairstow, Morgan, Kieswetter (wk), Patel, Woakes, Tredwell, Anderson, Dernbach.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Smith, Amla, Elgar, de Villiers (capt/wk), Duminy, du Plessis, Ontong, Parnell, Peterson, Steyn, M Morkel.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>You. Have. Mail.</strong> We know that the internet has pretty much killed society, exposing the narcissistic sociopath in us all. But once upon a time it was a sweet, innocent thing, <a href=\"http://yfrog.com/mmc1ejsj\">as this amusing report from 1992 shows</a>. (The headline is a fake, apparently, but the rest is the real thing.)</p> <p>What are your early memories of the internet? I remember <strike> the puce-faced horror of being caught by mother </strike> the phrase \"information superhighway\", and 'watching' Ian Healy hit a momentous series-winning six at Port Elizabeth on some newish website called 'Cricinfo'.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 5-0 (Cook 4, Bell 0)</strong> Dale Steyn's first ball of the match swings dangerously back in to Alastair Cook. This is Trent Bridge, after all. The third ball also shapes back in but Cook times it sweetly down the ground for four. An off-side wide completes the scoring for the over.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 10-0 (Cook 8, Bell 1)</strong> The left-arm spinner Robin Peterson is going to open the bowling. Bell takes a single from the first ball and then Cook sweeps round the corner for four.</p> <p>\"My mind has wandered this lunchtime,\" says Peter Harmer, \"and I'm wondering, if you were only allowed to pick players whose surname began with one letter, which letter would you chose.\" That's a great question. Off the top of my head I'd go for H (Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond, Hadlee, Holding) or W (Waugh, Waugh, Warne, Weekes, Worrell, Walcott, plus Wasim and Waqar if you're allowed them as Ws).</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 19-0 (Cook 12, Bell 6)</strong> Steyn's first ball is too straight and eased off the pads for four by Ian Bell. A similarly errant delivery later in the over is pinged to the midwicket boundary by Cook. A fine start for England. In other news, here's your daily statgasm. If England win today they will set a new record for win/loss ratio in ODIs during one calendar year: they would have won 13 and lost one. Not just that, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;orderby=win_loss_ratio;template=results;type=team;view=year\">their current win/loss ratio of 12 is almost double the next best.</a> England 2012: the greatest one-day team ever. End of and fact.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 23-1 (Bell LBW b Peterson 10)</strong> Bell, who is always so light on his feet against the spinners, Travoltas back in his crease to late cut Peterson for another boundary. And now he's gone! He played defensively outside the line of a delivery that went straight on from around the wicket and was given out LBW by Kumar Dharmasena. He's going to review it. I suppose there's a slight chance he got outside the line but I reckon this decision will be upheld. He's out! There wasn't even an 'umpire's call'. It hit him in line and would have hit leg stump four-fifths of the way up.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 23-1 (Cook 12, Bopara 0)</strong> Demon seamer Ravi Bopara has been promoted to No3. What a strange place he's in. Two months ago he seemed to have finally cracked it when he slapped Australia to all parts; now he can't buy a run.</p> <p>\"My first internet memory is of gathering round an acorn computer at school and slowly watching as the current weather was downloaded through the phonelines,\" says James Grinnell. \"It took 20 mins and looked like a particularly unartistic four-year-old had drawn a weather map that vaguely resembled the uk. We thought it was amazing obviously.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 24-2 (Bopara c de Villiers b Steyn 0)</strong> A golden duck for Ravi Bopara. He felt outside off stump at a good delivery from Dale Steyn and edged a straightforward catch to AB de Villiers. There was a sad inevitability to Bopara failing, although I'm not sure anyone expected a first-baller. He looks shot to bits mentally, almost as bad as Mark Ramprakash back in 1995.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 24-2 (Cook 12, Bairstow 0)</strong> Jonny Bairstow is beaten second ball by a storming delivery. Steyn appealed on his own for the caught behind but there was nothing in it. The next ball goes past the edge as well to complete a sensational over.</p> <p>\"My early internet memories include all the hype about 'working from home',\" says Dr Ian Hawke. \"Which brings the question: why do you go into the office to OBO from one screen to another? Is it the great office company, or your love of public transport?\" I love my colleagues dearly, and it's got nothing to do with the fact we can't use the OBO publishing system from home. Nothing at all.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 30-2 (Cook 14, Bairstow 4)</strong> Morne Morkel replaces Robin Peterson. Bairstow crunches him classily through midwicket for four. \"Does the fact that the Sun article was written by Dot Comme,\" begins Simon Pennington, \"and the 'riddle of 'E' mail' is also referenced at the end suggest this might have been an April 1 story?\" I've been had. I'm King Patsy. I've been played for a fool again, and this time there wasn't even a kooky broad with a love of geek pop involved. Darn it. Still, it's a decent excuse for us to reminisce about when the internet was good, eh? Eh?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 30-2 (Cook 14, Bairstow 4)</strong> Steyn is bowling straight and trying to shape it back into Cook, who is vulnerable to that angle of attack. After five balls on the stumps, he angles one across Cook and past the outside edge. A maiden.</p> <p>\"Well, the H-team (Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond, Headley, Harvey, Hill, Hadlee, Healy, Holding, Hall, Harbhajan (if he's allowed)) has probably the greatest batting line up,\" says Josh Robinson, \"and Clive Lloyd's side (Lawry, Langer, Lara, Leyland, Lloyd, Lindsay, Lindwall, Larwood, Laker, Lohmann, Lillee) has a fantastic attack, but I'd like to go out on a limb and say that this is perhaps the strongest of the lot: Hanif Mohammad, Arthur Morris, Phil Mead, Javed Miandad (c), Stan McCabe, Keith Miller, Rod Marsh, Malcolm Marshall, Ted McDonald, Muttiah Muralitharan, Glenn McGrath (arguably with Mushtaq Mohammad coming in for Marsh). It could be that I'm not old enough to have seen many of the greats, but I find it hard to argue with any side containing Marshall, McGrath and Murali.\" And Keith Miller first change. That's an awesome team. Then again, Larwood, Lillee and Lohmann...</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 39-2 (Cook 18, Bairstow 9)</strong> After 12 consecutive dot balls, Bairstow cuts Morkel crisply for four. It's a good over for England in fact, with nine from it when Cook pulls the last ball handsomely over midwicket for four. </p> <p>\"I first started using e-mail and the internet at university \u2013 this inevitably involved a 10-minute walk late in the evening from my dorm to the school's computer lab, sending a few e-mails and then popping in <a href=\"http://www.retrocpu.com/dos/games/0-9/1-0_soccer_manager\">a copy of One-Nil</a> into the floppy disk drive and staying up into the wee hours, watching Luc Nilis bang goals in for fun at the head of my strike force,\" says Darren Kilfara. \"What a game that was\u2026never mind that said floppy disk became infected by a prototypical virus which ultimately wiped out at least one of my family's PCs back at home. Totally worth it.\" And to think some people leave university with regrets.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 41-2 (Cook 19, Bairstow 10)</strong> Bairstow is put down by de Villiers, although it was an exceptionally difficult chance. He inside edged a sharp delivery from Steyn, which meant de Villiers had to change direction and then try to get his left hand down to take the ball at instep height. He got down in time but couldn't hang on. As Sir Ian Botham says on Sky, we should really probably him with saving four runs rather than putting it down as a dropped catch.</p> <p>\"That team of Ms is pretty good,\" says Rob Lee-Davey, \"but someone is going to have to make way for McCague.\" Especially if they have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_McCague\">team-bonding trips to Dublin</a>.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 42-2 (Cook 20, Bairstow 10)</strong> \"The B side is pretty good too,\" says Steve Hudson. \"The B side is pretty good too: Boycott, Sid Barnes, Bradman, Barrington, Border, Botham, Benaud (capt), Bedser, SF Barnes, Bishop, Bedi.\" And Colin Bland as 12th man.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 48-2 (Cook 25, Bairstow 11)</strong> Cook tries to cut the new bowler Parnell, but it's a bit too full for the shot and he bottom edges it on the bounce to de Villiers. He nails the shot later in the over, however, savaging Parnell for four. </p> <p>\"I was first aware of people actually using the internet in my sixth form at school (93/94),\" says Tim Davis. \"The small band of computer literate <strike> geeks </strike> fellow students back in those days would use the school computers in the library to email each other at lunchtime. 'But\u2026 why not just talk to each other?' I'd cry, somewhat mockingly. They're probably all happily married, rich, successful businessmen now. Whereas I'm still enduring the puce-faced horror of being caught by mother\u2026\" Was the web widely available in 1993-94? Crikey. When I recall the Borden Grammar School sixth form of 1993-94, the only W that springs to mind rhymes with ledgies.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 48-2 (Cook 25, Bairstow 12)</strong> The left-arm spinner Dean Elgar is on for Morkel. His fourth ball is a dipping full toss that Bairstow fails to put away, and there's just a single from the over. Cook has 25 from 32, Bairstow 12 from 27.</p> <p>\"My earliest memory of the Internet is the moment I finally had access, via my Dad's work laptop, an suddenly realising I had no idea what I wanted to read,\" says Brad McMillian. \"The term 'surfing the net' was in use by that time, and had conjured in my mind the idea that I would simply be taken on a random voyage of exciting discovery as soon as I logged on.

That looked pretty close but there were doubts over where it pitched and perhaps height. Hawkeye shows it did pitch fractionally outside leg. Everything else is bunkum.</p> <p>\"Barrington?\" says Alex Netherton. \"Does he means <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/21/golf.theopen200711?INTCMP=SRCH\">Barrington 'Biscuits' Barrington</a> (see 5pm)?\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 60-2 (Cook 28, Bairstow 17)</strong> Bairstow gives Elgar the charge and drags an inside edge for a single. Later in the over he premeditates a lap for a couple \u2013 and then Elgar bowls a big front-foot no-ball. That's criminal, especially when the punishment is a free hit, although he redeems himself with an excellent curving yorker that Bairstow can only block. Seven from the over.</p> <p>In other news, who wants to help an OBOette in distress? \"Perhaps somebody can help we find a game called 'Money, Money, Money' that I played on my grandfather's Vic-20 in 1981 or thereabouts,\" says Sara Torvalds. \"There are Commodore 64 games you can buy, but I've yet to see any of the really crude stuff for the Vic-20 available anywhere.

It was a stick man that you had to guide across the screen, avoiding asterisk 'snow flakes' while fetching a 'bag' of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 money and getting back safely.\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 63-2 (Cook 30, Bairstow 18)</strong> Parnell continues to feed Cook's cut, which on the Dunderhead Scale is right up there with informing Francis Begbie that's he the epitome of androgyny \u2013 but this time he rifles it straight to a fielder. Three from the over.</p> <p>\"My earliest memory of the internet is on the day that I got my A-level results,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"My Dad was a university lecturer at the time and had an early version of email with which he was able to contact my preferred university - some place in Staffordshire - to check I had got in. This was after he rang me at work with my results and got them wrong.\" The internet existed in the 1960s? Honk! Ho-honk! Come on, honk with me now.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 69-2 (Cook 31, Bairstow 22)</strong> South Africa take their bowling Powerplay at the first opportunity and give the ball to Robin Peterson. He concedes just one from the first five deliveries; then, with fine leg and square leg up, Bairstow sweeps between the two men for four.</p> <p>\"My highlight of the summer?\" says Luke Dealtry. \"Thanks for asking. I think it's the celebration unveiled by Ravi in the last few ODIs where he offers a strong-armed handshake just above waist height to whomsoever is nearest; none of this hugging or whooping rubbish. Think it'll ever catch on? I hear he's going for cotton slacks, a button-up shirt and a neckerchief if he plays in India.\" <br>Great point. Has there ever been a more chappish gesture on a cricket field <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-south-africa-2012/content/image/580423.html\">than the Bopara handshake</a>?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 73-2 (Cook 32, Bairstow 24)</strong> Morne Morkel is wided for a leg-side short ball to Bairstow. Four from the over. \"Steve Hudson's 'B' team looks very strong but would lose every game due to the number of byes it concedes,\" says Martin Duckworth. \"So may I suggest a 'Keeper, namely Boucher? And tell SF Barnes he's on the twos this week.\" You can have that pleasure. (And then reinstate him ahead of Ian Bishop.)</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 75-2 (Cook 34, Bairstow 25)</strong> Peterson puts down Cook, a very sharp return chance as he dived low to his left. He took a similar but probably more difficult chance to dismiss Ian Bell (I think) in the World Cup last year. He didn't close his hands at the right time which suggests he might have thought it was a bump ball.</p> <p>\"I was going to regale you with tales of meeting up with like-minded Star Trek: Deep Space Nine fans in 1995 thanks to the internet while everyone else in the country was making out to Lush B-sides, but instead you may want to take a peek at Ravi Bopara's wiki page,\" says my colleague James Walsh. \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bopara\">It's got a lot more duck-related lately</a>.\" It's really sad. He was in fantastic form before his personal problems. How many setbacks can a bloke cope with before he decides some things just aren't meant to be?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 79-3 (Bairstow c Ontong b Morkel 29)</strong> Bairstow has flicked Morne Morkel straight to deep midwicket. He seemed to time it extremely well, and I thought it was clearing the ropes, but in fact he pinged it straight to Justin Ontong. He was aiming towards square leg rather than midwicket. That's a frustrating dismissal because he was looking good and had swivel-pulled the previous delivery superbly for four.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 79-3 (Cook 34, Morgan 0)</strong> Stop whatever you're doing and acquaint yourself with the F5 button: the new batsman is the in-form Eoin Morgan.</p> <p>\"What is a good score on this pitch?\" says Andrew Hurley. \"270? Strange Finn is not playing, for all that I think it's good to finally see Woakes. The dryness of the pitch should really help Patel and Tredwell.\" I'm hopeless at judging pitches, but you'd think anything above 250 would be competitive. As ever, so much depends on Morgan. I'm not sure why they left Finn out as he's been England's best one-day bowler by a distance for the last 12 months, although he hasn't been quite at his best in this series.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 82-4 (Morgan c Amla b Duminy 0)</strong> Get back to work: Morgan has gone second ball for nought! AB de Villiers brought mid-on up a few yards and Morgan took the bait. He tried to drill the new bowler JP Duminy over the top but screwed it straight to Amla at mid-on. That's a mighty wicket for South Africa, and a triumph for the captain de Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 82-4 (Cook 37, Kieswetter 0)</strong> Clue 1: it has four letters. Clue 2: England are in it.</p> <p>\"My earliest internet memories: the year was 1995, I was in grade 5 and we purchased a newfangled invention called a dial-up modem,\" says SB Tang. \"Applications and websites I remember using: Hotmail, ICQ (remember that?), and a plethora of crummy search engines, including but not limited to, Altavista, Lycos and Yahoo. But, above all, I remember an incredible discovery made independently and simultaneously by both me and my mate Alex \u2014 Cricinfo. Truly, the cricketing gods' gift to our generation. Long may it prosper.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 86-4 (Cook 41, Kieswetter 0)</strong> Cook edges a cut at the new bowler Parnell through the vacant slip area for four. This will be a good test of the new batsman Craig Kieswetter; in his one-day international career he has usually started his innings in the first 10 overs or the last 10. This is a good chance to show he can rotate the strike and build an innings.</p> <p>\"Just tuned in to see wicket four go down,\" says Hannah Marsh. \"I'm going back to the Paras...\" Being quite stupid and all, for about 30 seconds I genuinely thought that was a reference to writing, and that the kids were now calling writing \"going back to the paras\".</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 88-4 (Cook 42, Kieswetter 0)</strong> \"First memory/use of internet: first job in 1998 (!) \u2013 told to research things on the internet, I spent 15 minutes staring at a blank Netscape Navigator page before a kindly colleague showed me where to type the url\u2026\" says Guy Mavor. Nowadays you could avoid human contact by emailing someone to ask how to do it.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 91-4 (Cook 45, Kieswetter 0)</strong> Three from Parnell's over. For the second time in the innings, England are rebuilding after the loss of two quick wickets.</p> <p>Do you mind if I have a drink of water before going back to the paras? Thanks. It's Buxton, a 500ml bottle. I buy them in packs of eight to save money. It makes sense to do so because I like to bring one each day for the hour train journey into London. It's so important to keep hydrated, especially in the summer. There are myriad benefits to drinking water.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 96-4 (Cook 49, Kieswetter 1)</strong> Cook drives Peterson off the back foot for a couple, helped by a misfield from Elgar at short extra. Kieswetter gets off the mark from his ninth delivery, driving to long off. His nurdling has improved since he started but there is still plenty of work to do. It'll be really interesting to see how he goes today.</p> <p>\"Hope all well?\" says our old friend Sam Collins before getting down to brass tacks. \"The bad news is I'm here again to ask you for another plug. The good news is I hope it will be worth watching.

It's not a trailer, as we haven't cut the film yet, but more something we are showing to distributors and money men to help us finish the film, to prove that we haven't been filming ourselves taking pictures of food for the last nine months. This promo features guys like Strauss, Pietersen, Modi, Holding, Clarke, Srinivasan, Nicholas, Chappell, Dravid and Ed Cowan. Mostly with their clothes on. Lord Selve and Mike Brearley are among the many others we've canvassed too, and should make the final cut that we are hoping to release in May/ June 2013. As independent filmmakers we need to keep asking people to spread the word, so please visit <a href=\"http://www.deathofagentlemanfilm.com\">www.deathofagentlemanfilm.com</a> for further details on the film and investment opportunities.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 99-4 (Cook 51, Kieswetter 2)</strong> A single off Parnell brings Cook to a strong half-century from 69 balls. It's a bit excessive to say he needed a score, but after 32 runs in the first four matches he'll be pleased with this. And, as he showed against Pakistan earlier this year, he knows how to bat through when the side are batting first. If England are going to win this they may well need a century from Cook.</p> <p>\"If it's any small consolation,\" says Michael Hunt, \"I spent more than a couple of seconds after reading Over 21 not understanding how you could have made that mistake, but also not really understanding Hannah Marsh's decision to get over the loss of wickets by returning top being a paratrooper.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 99-5 (Cook ct and b du Plessis 51)</strong> Dear oh dear. Francois du Plessis's part-time legspin has brought a wicket second ball. A batsman has 99 problems at the crease but a low full toss should never be one. Cook could have done pretty much anything with it, but he popped a low return catch that du Plessis claimed gleefully. That brought to mind Jacques Rudolph's dismissal of Nasser Hussain at Headingley in 2003; a real WTF moment. Du Plessis hardly ever bowls in ODIs; in fact, that wicket has halved his average of 115.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 101-5 (Kieswetter 3, Patel 1)</strong> A chap called 'Smylers' informs us that Steven Finn has a back injury, hence his absence. The advantage of that is that England now have Chris Woakes coming in at No8.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 111-5 (Kieswetter 10, Patel 2)</strong> Wayne Parnell bowls consecutive front-foot no-balls. The first free hit is squirted for a single by Kieswetter, the second driven for a single by Samit Patel, who was almost run out off a free hit the other day. Kieswetter shows his class with a stunning extra-cover drive for four, holding the pose at the end of his follow through, and then he bottom edges a wild cut stroke on the bounce to de Villiers. What a strange player he is. He uses the sublime and ridiculous as starting points to go further east and west.</p> <p>\"I'd love to send you an email about my first internet memory,\" says Alex Netherton. \"Sadly I am at work and am a bit distracted. I got into work for about nine in the morning (I set my alarm for half seven but got up at 6.59 and had a longer shower than usual instead) and got the bus to work. I've had two lunches today, because I'm going for a run in a bit and want to run further than usual. I had a salt beef baguette, and then some kedgeree a couple of hours later. I'm going to try to run seven miles, running from Highbury to Barbican then back again. Then I'm going to watch Breaking Bad. I think the most recent series has been the best so far, though I'm confused why people say it's good as the Sopranos, when it's not as memorable and far less clever scriptwise. I'm using the internet to send this though, which is apposite, I suppose.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 117-5 (Kieswetter 11, Patel 7)</strong> A bit of rubbish from du Plessis is cut crisply for four by Patel. Six from the over. \"You are inviting opprobrium with your purchasing of bottled water,\" says James Galea. \"In the Guardian's pages, indeed. You know those bottles are refillable? I've still got one at home with Ali Cook's lovely face on one side, Matt Prior's less lovely face on the other.\" Refillable with what? <em>Tap</em> water. Eugh!</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 118-5 (Kieswetter 12, Patel 7)</strong> A nice, aggressive move from AB de Villiers, who brings back Dale Steyn in the hope of some hot boot-on-throat action. A good over costs just one. Kieswetter has 12 from 30, Patel 7 from 8.</p> <p>\"I remember seeing the 'internet' on our library PCs at Sheffield Uni in 1993,\" says Guy Hornsby. \"Eager to delve in, I started up Netscape and stared at the gruesome flashing colours of Yahoo's homepage (for a couple of weeks I thought it was the homepage of the entire internet until I found the settings) and created my cc mail account so I could email stuff to other students from a floppy disk. That whole last sentence would mean almost nothing to anyone under 30 would it? I still remember fondly playing Doom on my 'Maths DX 66 co-processor' (8mb RAM!!!) and thinking it was the best thing in the world. I blame my 2:2 in Geography on Championship Manager though. That and my 56k modem. God pictures downloaded slowly in those days.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 124-5 (Kieswetter 16, Patel 8)</strong> Kieswetter dances down the track to the new bowler Elgar to blast his second ball sweetly to long off for a single. He plays some bloody good shots for one, but he still doesn't play enough shots for one. There are mitigating circumstances, of course, but 62 per cent of his deliveries in this innings have been dot balls. </p> <p>\"Still drooling over which openers to select for the G-men: Greenidge, Gooch, Gayle, Gavaskar?\" drools Michael Wilbur. \"We should find a place somewhere for WG Grace, of course, and I'd like Gower coming in the middle order under no pressure at 400-2. Our keeper Gilchrist should have some licence to play his shots. We might perm one of Ganguly, Greig, Gambhir, Gatting to complete the batting places, but I'm struggling to come up with a strong bowling attack beyond Garner, Gillespie and Gibbs. I think Gary Gilmour doesn't quite have the gravitas required to mix along with his team mates here, or maybe Greig has a role here? Any thoughts on our third quickie?\" It's between Charlie Griffith and Darren Gough I'd say. Or you could whistle up Roy Gilchrist to make things a bit lively. Tony Greig has to play at No6; he's streets ahead of the others.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 124-6 (Patel c de Villiers b Steyn 9)</strong> Brilliant work from Dale Steyn, who has hoodwinked Samit Patel with the slower bouncer. Patel leered at it for a few seconds with the befuddlement of a man whose space/time continuum had just been broken before gloving it gently on its way to the keeper AB de Villiers. It's another triumph for de Villiers, who brought back Steyn for precisely that purpose. I wonder if Roy Gilchrist ever used the slower bouncer.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 124-6 (Kieswetter 16, Woakes 0)</strong> A wicket maiden from Stale Deyn, brother of Agyness. \"I'd love to tell you about my internet memories too, but I'm at work too and a bit bored,\" says Robert Armes. \"I got up at 7.30 this morning, woken by my wife opening the curtains pointedly loudly. I then had breakfast, which consisted of muesli and coffee. I had a sandwich for lunch but am unsure what I'll be eating this evening.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 130-6 (Kieswetter 21, Woakes 1)</strong> Kieswetter pulls a filthy delivery from Elgar for four and then pushes a single, his 1000th run in ODIs. His figures (average 31; strike rate 91) are pretty good for a man whose place does not always seem entirely secure.</p> <p>\"In other fascinating/mildly interesting/boring/utterly useless internet-related news, WWW is the only initialism that takes longer to say than what it stands for: World Wide Web,\" says Nick Barrett. \"Before you ask no that will not get you the ladies in bars. i know, I was shocked as well.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 132-6 (Kieswetter 22, Woakes 2)</strong> Robin Peterson is back. Chris Woakes is a decent man to have at No8; at the age of 23 he has six first-class centuries (though oddly he has never reached fifty in a one-day match, even for Warwickshire). He is taking time to play himself in, as he must with England six down, and there are two from the over.</p> <p>\"Our household got online in 1996, when I was 13,\" says Niall Harden, \"and I remember typing in http://www.sex.com, just to see what was there. I then panicked, deleted most of the information on my dad's hard drive, and for a while I steamed open all the bills which came in the post, in the belief that our itemised phone bill would have a detailed browser history.\" Now this is more like it. Come on, some of you must have stories of being caught with your browsers down.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 135-6 (Kieswetter 24, Woakes 3)</strong> Duminy replaces Elgar, the 35th bowling chance of the day. Three singles from the over. \"Lot of talk on Sky about low totals and cagey cricket creeping into 50-over cricket (and this series in particular),\" says Harry Tuttle. \"God forbid the Test match will die out, but as it gets rarer our attitude to the different types of LO cricket will evolve. T20 has clearly accelerated thinking about run-scoring, risk-taking and bowling tactics \u2013 not all of it attacking, as is the caricature (for example, top-level T20 is an environment where a dot ball is just as valuable as a wicket). This has clearly had a trickledown (or up) effect on ODIs \u2013 they're no longer sped-up Tests, but slowed down T20s.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 140-6 (Kieswetter 27, Woakes 5)</strong> Woakes almost offers a return catch, pushing the ball <em>just</em> past his left hand as he dived low to his left. Five singles from the over, and now England have to take the batting Powerplay.</p> <p>\"Tell Nick Barrett (32nd over) that VW is another example, as it George W (Walker) Bush,\" says Steve Hudson. \"And tell him I've pulled loads of birds with this stuff, it's catnip to them.\" They love the word 'birds' too, I've heard. As for the first bit, I've been had again! It's the day of the patsy.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 149-6 (Kieswetter 32, Woakes 9)</strong> Morne Morkel bowls the first ball of the Powerplay, and Craig Kieswetter smashes it over the covers for four. Then Woakes, beaten for pace, top-edges a hook over the keeper's head for four more. That almost went for six.</p> <p>\"Tell Steve Hudson that if it takes him longer to say 'Dubya' than 'Walker' then he's doing it differently,\" says Josh Robinson. I've been had again!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 155-6 (Kieswetter 33, Woakes 14)</strong> England probably need to get up to 220 to give themselves any chance. Woakes adds four to the total with another top edge, this time as he attempts to cut Parnell. </p> <p>\"A post about accessing internet porn sent by 'Niall Harden'?\" says Sean Moore. \"Really?\" Arf. A quick browse through the Guardian search engine will tell you he's an OBO regular. Then again I may have been inventing emails from him for the last five years, all the while building up to this moment. Just wait till you see what the punchline is for 'Gary Naylor'.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 156-7 (Kieswetter c Amla b Morkel 33)</strong> Craig Kieswetter's useful innings ends in frustration fashion. He tried to smash Morkel back over his head but sliced it miles in the air, and Hashim Amla backpedalled from mid-off to take a comfortable catch. It might have been a slower ball. Either way, Kieswetter probably didn't need to play that shot at that time; it's all part of his education. Not that this is of any consolation to England just now, because they are going to lose this game and draw the series 2-2. There have been so many soft dismissals today. Sometimes it happens.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 157-7 (Woakes 16, Tredwell 0)</strong> \"As your reader seems to be fascinated by your exemplary first person narrative detailing everything (a student of Russian formalism could give you the correct term for this, but I always got the fabula and syuzhet confused even when I was teaching it), I thought I would let him/her know there is a short story based on a minute by minute update of goings on during a day (an MBM short story no less) by Leonhard Thoma,\" says Ian Copestake. \"Unfortunately it's in German but its called 'Verlieren'.\" A short story about nothing? They've nicked my idea!</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 159-7 (Woakes 17, Tredwell 1)</strong> \"George Walker Bush,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"I believe both Josh Robinson and Steve Hudson have spelt 'Walker' incorrectly.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 165-7 (Woakes 22, Tredwell 2)</strong> Morkel pulls up with a side problem, although after a bit of treatment he decides to complete the over. That's a bit surprising; why risk it? Woakes flicks a short ball off the hip for four.</p> <p>\"Reading The Spin on Kieswetter and Prior this morning while England<br>Women were beating Pakistan,\" begins Smylers, \"I was wondering how you think Sarah Taylor compares to either of them? In today's T20 match she scored 35 from 17 balls.\" She is a massive genius. <a href=\"https://en.twitter.com/selvecricket/status/241108095651168256\">It's hard to disagree with Selve's verdict</a>.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 168-7 (Woakes 24, Tredwell 3)</strong> Tredwell is beaten, trying to cut a short one from Duminy, and then Woakes is almost run out. A direct hit from du Plessis in the covers would have done for him.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 172-7 (Woakes 26, Tredwell 5)</strong> If you had told us two weeks ago that this series would end 2-2, we would have envisaged a thriller. As it is the DVD of this series, entitled 'The Greatest One-Day Series' will be available from never, priced \u00a31.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 174-7 (Woakes 27, Tredwell 6)</strong> Dale Steyn returns to the attack. I think Nasser just said that's the 17th bowling change of the innings. England continue to potter along in singles for the time being. If Woakes is still there in around four overs' time he will start to tee off.</p> <p>\"I remember coming home from boarding school aged about 14 and getting on the web the first time my parents went out with all the filthy intentions you might expect,\" says David Sherwin. \"I opened the browser history (why, I'm not sure) to discover that one of my parents (and it wasn't hard to guess which) shared all my filthy intentions. Not only was this somewhat deflating in that moment, I foolishly brought it up as a 'winning gambit' next time I was arguing with my parents. Bit of a frosty dinner table that evening.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 175-8 (Tredwell b Peterson 6)</strong> Tredwell is done completely in the flight by Peterson, bowled off the inside edge as he tries a vile smear across the line.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 175-9 (Anderson c M Morkel b Peterson 0)</strong> Two in two balls. Anderson plays a strangely ambitious shot, mistiming a big drive high in the air to mid-off. He was done in the flight as well. Anderson should have just played for Woakes at that stage.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 177-9 (Woakes 29, Dernbach 1)</strong> The batsmen crossed, which means Woakes will face the hat-trick ball. He inside edges it safely round the corner and then drives a single down the ground. Dernbach also takes a single off the final ball; an odd move as it means he rather than Woakes will face Dale Steyn.</p> <p>\"Not a first memory of the internet, but the very latest tale of how far it has come,\" says Dom Price. \"Today The Telegraph puts up a story on its website about a potential cure for cancer that is stalled through lack of funds; someone in the comments sections suggests a crowd-sourcing web page; <a href=\"http://www.fundingjar.com/projects/130/project-info/\">it's set up immediately</a>; and they are already 1% of the way to their total within a few hours. Well done The Internet.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 181-9 (Woakes 32, Dernbach 2)</strong> Dernbach somehow survives Steyn's first three deliveries before getting a single off the fourth. Woakes keeps the strike with a single off the lat ball.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 182 all out (Dernbach c de Villiers b Parnell 2)</strong> Another poor stroke ends an innings of soft dismissals. Dernbach top edges a pull to the keeper and South Africa will need just <strong>183 </strong>to ensure the series ends 2-2. The Is are already dotted, and you'd expect them to care of the Ts.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>The good news</strong> is that England defended an even feebler total against South Africa at last year's World Cup. The bad news is that they are not going to do so today/night. The series is going to end 2-2. Go home. Play on the internet.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 8-0 (target 183; Amla 7, Smith 1)</strong> You want two things in one-day cricket: lots of runs and close finishes. As such, this series has been a bit of a stinker. Jimmy Anderson is going to bowl the first over. He usually makes the ball swing here. It's not enough to make it talk; if England are to win he needs to make it sing like a canary. He does get a bit of swing, but his second ball is far too straight and Amla wrists it through midwicket for four.</p> <p>\"Evening Smyth <strike> , evening everybody </strike>,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Just out of interest: what odds would you give on an England victory this evening?\"</p> <p>I'm not giving odds as a I'm poor man who needs every last copper in that jar, but you can choose any forfeit you like if England win, so long as it won't end up with me having a stint in the clink.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 8-1 (Smith c Tredwell b Dernbach 1)</strong> Prepare the forfeits. It's on! Smith has gone, caught by Tredwell at second slip off Dernbach. He launched himself towards a very wide delivery that raced off the edge towards Tredwell. He dropped a couple on Sunday but was able to grab this at the second attempt after it bounced off his chest.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 11-1 (target 183; Amla 7, du Plessis 3)</strong> The out-of-form Faf du Plessis has been promoted to No3. Get Ravi Bopara on.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 11-2 (du Plessis c Kieswetter b Anderson 3)</strong> Crikey. That's right: <em>crikey</em>. South Africa are two down, and du Plessis's miserable trot has continued. He got a nice healthy edge to a beautiful lifting delivery from Anderson, and Kieswetter took a routine catch. Anderson punches the air with the zeal of a man who thinks England can win this.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 11-2 (target 183; Amla 7, Elgar 0)</strong><br>Anderson's first ball to Elgar is a beauty that swings back, rams into the thigh and gets stuck between his legs. Anderson is charging in at the moment. His last ball goes the other way and beats Edgar's nervous push. Brilliant stuff.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 13-2 (target 183; Amla 8, Elgar 1)</strong> If England get Amla soon they might start to fancy this, because South Africa don't have that strong a batting line-up. Elgar is beaten again, this time by Dernbach.</p> <p>\"Forfeit,\" says Keith Flett. \"If England win, Smyth doesn't shave until January 1st...\" It's a deal.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 14-3 (Elgar c Kieswetter b Anderson 1)</strong> This is sensational bowling. Anderson gave Elgar an emphatic working-over, beating him with consecutive deliveries before putting him out of his misery with another cracker that lifted and seamed away to take a thin edge on its way through to Kieswetter. That really was outstanding. Elgar goes for one from 10 balls, and he played and missed at five of those.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 14-3 (target 183; Amla 8, de Villiers 0)</strong> Anderson swerves another cracker past the new batsman AB de Villiers. A dot ball means that Anderson has bowled consecutive wicket maidens. This must surely be his favourite ground. He is the only man to <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=11;ground=34;template=results;type=bowling\">take more than 50 wickets in international cricket at Trent Bridge</a>.</p> <p>\"I was having a conversation during the Test series (pre-Strauss retirement) on the England XI for the first Ashes Test next summer\" says William Hardy. \"He had no Strauss or Bell, Trott opening, Prior at No6 and Woakes in. Personally, I can't see either England moving away from their formula, or Bell being dropped. But I wondered what you thought the side would be, and if you see any major changes?\" These are really difficult. I did one of these in March 2008, ahead of 2009, and it was completely wrong (it had Vaughan, Panesar, Ambrose I think). But if I was guessing I would say: Cook, Carberry, Trott, Pietersen, Bell, Morgan, Prior, Swann, Broad, Anderson, Finn. Groundbreaking stuff, eh. Obviously Carberry, KP and Morgan are the iffy three there. I also wouldn't be shocked if Swann didn't make it, though obviously we hope he does.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 19-3 (target 183; Amla 9, de Villiers 4)</strong> Pressure? Arf. De Villiers leans into a delicious back-foot drive at Dernbach that races through the covers for four.</p> <p>\"Do you share the nagging feeling that while Amla's still at the crease, none of this matters?\" says professional mindreader Brad McMillan.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 26-3 (target 183; Amla 11, de Villiers 9)</strong> de Villiers plays a beautiful stroke, timing Anderson to the left of mid-on for four. Then he plays a defensive shot into the ground, from where it kicks to hit him in the grille.</p> <p>\"Surely the only response to a beard related forfeit from Flett is for him to shave off his whiskers should SA still win this,\" says Peter McKean. \"Or at least pare it back to some mutton chops.\" Keith Flett has a beard?</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 35-3 (target 183; Amla 11, de Villiers 17)</strong> South Africa have plenty of overs to work with but de Villiers only plays one way, and he pulls majestic consecutive boundaries off Dernbach. The strike rate for each length of delivery on Dernbach's fledgling pitch map is pretty instructive: full (150.00), good (0.00), short (233.33). Next stop, the science of rockets.</p> <p>\"I thought the forfeit was supposed to be for you,\" says Jamie Jermain, \"not for everyone else...\"</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 38-3 (target 183; Amla 13, de Villiers 18)</strong> Another good over from Anderson costs just three. He'll probably have one more because a wicket here could decide the match.</p> <p>\"Forfeit: Smyth to end every sentence, spoken or written, with 'LOL' for a year,\" says Tom Bowtell. \"LOL.\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 43-3 (target 183; Amla 17, de Villiers 19)</strong> Chris Woakes replaces Jade Dernbach. His first over goes for five and includes a good yorker that Amla digs out.</p> <p>\"I did indeed shave my beard off last year to raise money for Right To Work,\" says Keith Flett. \"In the end I got more money from people demanding I immediately grow it back....\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 44-3 (target 183; Amla 18, de Villiers 19)</strong> Morgan at point saves four when Amla clatters Anderson high to his right. One from the over. </p> <p>\"I remember it before it was the internet, when you had to be in the US armed forces or at a research university, to use Arpanet, then Janet (Joint Academic Network) and my first actual use was for Chemical Abstracts including all the formulae which were a real bugger, or the patent or legal databases, and esa-aerospace,\" says John Starbuck. \"Then the newspapers woke up and started going electronic and there were loads of competing systems. HTTP started (and so did laptops) in the very early 1990s. In 1996-97 we began getting proper search engines and the rubbish began, too. Thankfully, someone managed to invent browsers which allowed email and the OBO as such came into being in the fullness of time, so all manner of things became well.\"</p> <p>To precis the above: it could have been like Wargames had the OBO not saved the world.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 53-3 (target 183; Amla 27, de Villiers 19)</strong> Amla edges Woakes a fraction just short of keeper and slip, and the ball bounces between them for four. The next ball is checked in the air but short of mid-on. Amla is clearly starting to feel the pressure, as he shows with a <em>stunning</em> back-foot cover drive for four. What a shot.</p> <p>\"Can't believe no-one's mentioned the bane of early internet geekery, the modem!\" says Alex Book. \"More specifically, the 1200 or 2400 baud modem (I never did find out what 'baud' was \u2013 all I know is that was bloody slow). I was so excited when I borrowed one from a friend, but can remember the noise it used to make, most evenings in my parents house during the mid-90s, as I would beg and plead with the blasted thing to work and let me access the dial-up text-based game I was addicted to at the time. Dial-up! Text-based! Modem! I can imagine the day I try to explain to my infant son about any of this \u2013 his incomprehension will be absolute. Then again, to anyone with a life during their teenage years, it might have proved somewhat hard to explain anyway.\"</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 55-3 (target 183; Amla 28, de Villiers 20)</strong> The bald community's James Tredwell comes on to replace Jimmy Anderson, who bowled a classy spell of 6-2-19-2. His fourth ball turns a mile, pitching well outside off stump before spitting past Amla's left leg. Two from the over.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 61-3 (target 183; Amla 29, de Villiers 25)</strong> A piece of rubbish from Woakes, short and leg stump, is whirled emphatically round the corner for four by de Villiers. He looks in great nick, as he has for most of the summer, even though he hasn't reached fifty in the internationals.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 67-3 (target 183; Amla 34, de Villiers 27)</strong> Samit Patel replaces James Tredwell. Amla dances down the track to thrash a glorious cover drive for four.</p> <p>\"Hi Rob, I just finished my run,\" says Alex Netherton. \"It was actually seven and a half miles as I felt quite energetic. Probably due to my two lunches (one salt beef baguette and then a kedgeree a couple of hours later). For dinner I think I might have fishfingers, but already I've had a strawberry milkshake and a cereal bar as I was quite hungry when I got in. Tomorrow I think I'll have a smoothie for breakfast, and I'll be keeping the alarm set to 7.30, though I can't be sure I won't wake up before then! Again, not much to do with internet memories, but I am again sending this via the internet. I'll send another update when the cricket starts again in a bit. Bye.\"</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 71-3 (target 183; Amla 36, de Villiers 28)</strong> Maverick captaincy from Alastair Cook, who doesn't take the bowling Powerplay at the first opportunity. England need a wicket here, and they almost get it when Amla, on the back foot, inside edges onto the pads. That could easily have hit the stumps.</p> <p>\"Alex Book reminded of something I miss about the early days of the internet,\" says Brad McMillan, \"namely hearing my mum say 'they're on the Internet again,' after finding my Grandparents' phone was engaged.\" Ha, I'd forgotten all about that.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 76-3 (target 183; Amla 39, de Villiers 30)</strong> England are waiting for a mistake, which is understandable in the circumstances but also risky given the quality of these two batsmen. They can eschew risk and work the ball around for singles, as they do in that Patel over. There is a token run-out referral against de Villiers, but he was comfortably home. Five from the over.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 82-3 (target 183; Amla 44, de Villiers 31)</strong> Amla is playing wonderfully. When Tredwell tries to tempt him with a bit of flight, Amla launches a gorgeous drive over mid-off for a one-bounce four.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 85-3 (target 183; Amla 45, de Villiers 33)</strong> With England needing a wicket, it's a good move to bring Ravi Bopara into the attack. That is not a sentence that has ever been typed before. He has a <em>huge</em> LBW shout against de Villiers first ball that is turned down by Richard Illingworth. It might be going down leg but this is really close. I would have reviewed that, although Alastair Cook has decided not to do so. Alastair Cook is a wise man; it was swinging down leg side. The second ball goes the other way to beat de Villiers' outside edge. A good first over from the new George Lohmann.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 87-3 (target 183; Amla 46, de Villiers 34)</strong> Amla miscues a couple of reverse sweeps off Tredwell.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 90-3 (target 183; Amla 48, de Villiers 35)</strong> Bopara is getting some useful inswing, if gentle, and an LBW b Bopara is probably England's best chance of a wicket just now. Three from the over. South Africa need 93 from 29 overs.</p> <p>\"It must have been around 1978 when I was helping some techies test early communications via computers,\" says John Starbuck. \"They had invented a way of swapping screen images and modifying them but were stuck for something to use in our communications with the Open University, so I took the light-pen (as it wasn't then called) and drew a noughts &amp; crosses grid, with a cross in the centre. I won, but was this the first multi-player game?\"</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 100-3 (target 183; Amla 49, de Villiers 44)</strong> England take the bowling Powerplay and go back to Dernbach. De Villiers leans into a drive that is in the air for a while but perfectly bisects extra cover and mid off before scooting away for four. The next ball is timed gloriously down the ground for four more. Those two shots were a thrilling snapshot of his exceptional talent.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 108-3 (target 183; Amla 50, de Villiers 50)</strong> Jimmy Anderson is back. This is the game, right now. England have to take a wicket. Amla pushes a single to reach another lovely fifty from 63 balls. His scores against England this summer are 311*, 9, 28, 13, 121, 150, 43, 45 and now 50*. At the moment he's actually being overshadowed by de Villiers, who is playing some sublime strokes. When Anderson overpitches, de Villiers times another straight drive for four, a shot so pristine you could eat your dinner off it. A single off the last ball takes him to a brilliant half-century, his first of the international summer, from only 54 balls.</p> <p>\"Keith Flett made the rookie mistake of failing to stipulate which part of your body you have avoid shaving,\" says Tom van der Gucht. \"When Amla wins this for SA you can duck out of growing a beard by claiming that you were referring to your armpits or feet!\" Hang on, so I have to do the forfeit even if I win the bet? Not even George Costanza would put up with that.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 118-3 (target 183; Amla 55, de Villiers 51)</strong> Ten from Dernbach's over, none in boundaries. This match is done. Got anything to talk about? <strike> Get involved </strike> Send in your emails on any subject you like. Has anyone heard the new Sky Ferreira song? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyVW1uLFYT8\">That's good</a>. I might have some chicken for tea when I get home, although I probably won't get in till 11 so maybe I should get something from the canteen.</p> <p>\"After the three T20s here, we next face Afghanistan in Sri Lanka,\" says Wayne Trotman. \"Superb that such conflict-filled countries are represented, I think. I thought others might like to know that, at least overseas, Eurosport are broadcasting the whole competition.\" Are they the ones who've hired KP, or is that ESPN?</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 126-3 (target 183; Amla 57, de Villiers 57)</strong> Four more to de Villiers, pinged behind square on the leg side off Anderson. \"This is painful now,\" says Simon McMahon. \"Which reminds me, I've got the dentist tomorrow and I'm not looking forward to it. Appointments at 2.30. Last time I went he said my teeth were OK but my gums might have to come out.\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 132-3 (target 183; Amla 60, de Villiers 60)</strong> De Villiers leading edges Woakes over point for two, a rare false stroke. This partnership has been a great example of mature, high-class batsmen not so much averting a crisis as ignoring it. Their experience allows them just to go out and play, whether the score is 14 for three or 140 for three, and they have calmly taken the game away from England. Kieswetter loses Tredwell's throw from the deep in the lights and, with Bopara daydreaming behind him, South Africa can steal an overthrow. South Africa have taken 42 runs from the bowling Powerplay.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 138-3 (target 183; Amla 64, de Villiers 62)</strong> On Sky, Shane Warne says Alastair Cook has done a \"pretty good job\" as captain in this series. Coming from one of cricket's great lost captains, that's pretty high praise. Ian Bell at mid-on makes a great diving stop when Amla pushes Anderson to his left. That saved three runs, and that might just be the difference between a six-wicket defeat and a seven-wicket defeat.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 141-3 (target 183; Amla 65, de Villiers 64)</strong> De Villiers survives a run-out referral after an excellent piece of work from the bowler Woakes, who raced de Villiers to the non-striker's end and broke the stumps with an underarm throw.</p> <p>\"Things are looking bad for England, but the Aussies let Pakistan beat them by 7 wickets (with 31 balls remaining) in the first T20 in UAE,\" says Sara Torvalds. \"So that's all to the good, right?\" Whisper it \u2013 ssssshhhhhh \u2013 but I've never really done the whole Australia schadenfreude thing. No idea why.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 145-3 (target 183; Amla 68, de Villiers 65)</strong> Bopara on, Anderson off with fine but futile figures of 9-2-41-2. South Africa are coasting. </p> <p>\"If you're hungry, and nobody else can help you, and if you can find them (in your canteen), I strongly recommend Pepperami, specifically the red-packeted 'hot' variety,\" says Brad McMillan. \"I'm presently addicted, 2-3 per day, having replaced cigarettes with them last September. Not sure what the health police would have to say though.\" That sounds lovely, but aren't they \u2013 what's the phrase I'm looking for \u2013 absolutely disgusting?</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 149-3 (target 183; Amla 69, de Villiers 67)</strong> \"For supper I had boerewors, pap, gravy and peas and a small glass of red wine,\" says Simon Pamphilon. \"For pudding I had a mild heart attack, after the TV news reader said England were on the ropes all out for 182, and then, in passing, mentioned that we were 11 for 2 before cutting to the weather. I ran to the computer, called up the OBO, and superstitiously began reading from the preamble. Took until the 23rd over before my pulse rate returned to normal. Amla!!! If we weren't a republic he would be Sir Hashim by now.\"</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 153-3 (target 183; Amla 72, de Villiers 68)</strong> Bopara beats Amla with a good delivery outside off stump. South Africa need 30 from 114 balls. \"'Send your emails in on any subject you like',\" says Phil Sawyer. Really? You really want to hear my well rehearsed rant about how Marvel Comics went so badly wrong with the Spider-Man 'One More Day' story line and how I've never forgiven them since? You really are desperate for emails. Almost as desperate as I am for human company following my room emptying rants about how Marvel Comics etc and so on.\" Man, I thought I was the only one.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 163-3 (target 183; Amla 80, de Villiers 70)</strong> For those who do enjoy Australia's misfortune, I think I'm right in saying that today's defeat drops them to 10th in the ICC T20 table \u2013 below not only Bangladesh but also Ireland. Tenth! Anyway, enough of that, there's cricket going on at Trent Bridge, and Amla has just blitzed an outrageous six over extra cover off Tredwell. He ran down the track to turn it into a half volley and then launched it all the way. This is now a record fourth-wicket partnership for South Africa against England in one-day cricket.</p> <p>\"The xx,\" says Dan Lucas. \"Anyone heard this yet? I was more entertained waiting for the iTunes updates to download than I was listening to it. Most boring band ever?\" Pretty much. Almost as boring as The Wire.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 176-3 (target 183; Amla 92, de Villiers 70)</strong> Amla is ending this in a hurry. He drives Dernbach for four, edges another to third man and then smashes a cut stroke for the third boundary of the over. This is lovely, selfless batting from Hashim Amla, who realises I have only one train an hour from St Pancras and wouldn't mind getting the 2055.</p> <p>\"Re: 24th over, it's ESPN, not Afghanistan, who've hired KP. But never say never when mercenaries are involved,\" says Eamonn Maloney. \"and re: 28th over, the reason that you don't 'do' Australia schadenfreude is probably that you're not a prick.\" Well...</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>34.3 overs: South Africa 186-3 (Amla 97, de Villiers 75). SOUTH AFRICA WIN BY SEVEN WICKETS TO SQUARE THE SERIES 2-2</strong> Hasim Amla hits the winning boundary off Jade Dernbach. South Africa have <em>battered</em> England, with seven wickets and 93 balls to spare, and a slightly muted series ends 2-2. It's the right result. The remarkable Amla has averaged over 100 in both the Test and one-day series. Right here, right now, there is no better batsman on earth. The result ends England's run of seven consecutive one-day series wins at home, but they remain top of the rankings and, as I said at the start, that's all that matters. Thanks for your emails; see you for the first of three T20 internationals on Saturday.</p>",
  "<p>Muammar Gaddafi's former spy chief Abdullah al-Senussi, the man thought to have orchestrated the Lockerbie bombing, was extradited to Libya from Mauritania on Wednesday amid an international legal tussle over where he should face trial.</p> <p>Officials in Mauritania returned Senussi to Libya six months after he slipped into their country on a false passport. Senussi arrived back in Tripoli at lunchtime. He emerged from an ambulance helicopter, seemingly relaxed and with a nervous smile, before Libyan security officials whisked him away to prison.</p> <p>Senussi, Gaddafi's former director of military intelligence, is one of the world's most wanted men. Libya, France and the international criminal court (ICC) are all seeking his extradition.</p> <p>France wants to question him in connection with the bombing of a UTA passenger plane in 1989. The ICC has indicted him for crimes against humanity during Libya's civil war last year.</p> <p>Britain also has a strong interest in Senussi and is likely to try to interview him in connection with the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Senussi headed Libya's external security organisation at the time and is said to have recruited Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the only man convicted of bombing the Pan Am 103 flight, which killed 270 people. Megrahi died at his home in Libya in May. The US also wants to arrest Senussi in connection with Lockerbie.</p> <p>Speaking from her home in New Jersey, Susan Cohen, whose daughter Theodora, 20, was one of 35 Syracuse University students killed in the bombing, said it would be \"excellent\" if Scottish investigators succeeded in meeting him.</p> <p>\"I would thoroughly urge them to do so,\" she said. \"It's vital to interview Senussi. I would hope they will be interviewing others. I think it's extremely important that we know. There may be other people [in Libya] who can be indicted and if that is the case, we need to do that.\"</p> <p>As Gaddafi's trusted confidante and brother-in-law, Senussi is now in a unique position to shed light on the secrets of the Gaddafi era. In an interview with the Guardian in May, Libya's prime minister Abdurrahim el-Keib called Senussi the ousted regime's \"black box\".</p> <p>He also said Senussi knew the identity of the killer of PC Yvonne Fletcher, shot dead outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984. \"I guarantee he was almost directly or indirectly involved in most if not all of the crimes [of the former regime],\" Keib said. He added: \"That doesn't mean others weren't involved. But he definitely knows who they were.\"</p> <p>On Wednesday John Murray, a former police constable who was on duty with Fletcher outside the embassy, and who remembers her dying in his arms, said the UK should seek permission to interview Senussi. The case has remained open since her murder. \"Senussi was one of the key players. He's got all the answers. If they [the government] were taking the Yvonne investigation seriously they would be on the plane to Libya already,\" he said. Foreign Office officials said the UK had already formally asked the Libyan government to facilitate any investigation into Lockerbie and the Fletcher killing. But it remains unclear what access to Senussi \u2013 if any \u2013 British detectives will be given.</p> <p>His extradition comes at a moment of political uncertainty for Libya, as it struggles to put in place a new transitional government following July's historic post-Gaddafi elections, the first democratic vote in the country for more than 40 years. A new prime minister may emerge next week, amid horsetrading between centrists and Islamists in the new parliament. Libyan officials hailed Senussi's arrest on Wednesday as a crucial step towards the creation of a state based on institutions and justice.</p> <p>But the case will deepen Libya's legal standoff with the international community. The ICC said Senussi should be handed over for trial in the Hague. It indicted him last year, along with Gaddafi and his son Saif al-Islam, for crimes committed against civilians.</p> <p>Saif was arrested by Libyan forces in November. Tripoli now says Saif will appear in court this month, likely before the ICC judges issue a decision on whether they consider Libya has a legal system robust enough to guarantee a fair trial. The issue of the death penalty \u2013 certain to be demanded by Libyan prosecutors \u2013 will prove highly contentious.</p> <p>Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who prosecuted the late Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague, said Libya could be heading for another political showdown with the ICC if it refuses to hand Senussi over. The ICC has already crossed swords with Libya after one of its defence lawyers, Melinda Taylor, was detained earlier this year while visiting Saif in the western mountain town of Zintan. \"Libya will have to make an application to claim admissibility. It depends whether the ICC desires to have this case,\" Nice said.</p> <p>Senussi is now in custody in Tripoli's Hadbat al-Khadra prison, guarded by the ministry of justice and police. The prison houses other prominent figures from the former regime, including Gaddafi's prime minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi and external intelligence chief Abuzeid Dorda. Libya's deputy prosecutor general, Taha Baara, said Senussi would undergo routine medical tests before undergoing interrogation.</p> <p>Libya's provisional government wants to try him in connection with numerous human rights abuses, including the massacre of 1,200 prisoners at the Abu Salim jail in 1996, which he is said to have personally supervised. During the 2011 Libyan civil war, he was blamed for orchestrating killings in the city of Benghazi and recruiting foreign mercenaries. Senussi was married to Gaddafi's sister-in-law. Leaked US diplomatic cables describe him as a trusted \"senior regime figure\" \"who had played a role as minder of the more troublesome Gaddafi offspring\".</p> <p>They add: \"Sanussi \u2026 is usually in physical proximity to the tent in which Gaddafi holds meetings with visiting foreign dignitaries and, according to members of Gaddafi's protocol office, personally oversees Gaddafi's close protection detail.\"Senussi reportedly fled Tripoli as it fell to the rebels in August 2011, going first to Sirte and then heading southwards, home to his Megarha tribe before going to ground in Ghat. In October, when Gaddafi was killed, he crossed into Niger with a Tuareg escort. In November, according to reports, he was first in Mali then Mauritania and finally Morocco. Senussi arrived in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott from Casablanca on a scheduled Royal Air Maroc flight on 16 March. Mauritania said he was identified in a routine passport check but Arab sources claim French intelligence was involved in the operation.</p> <p>The Moroccan magazine Telquel reported that he had been under surveillance for some time by Moroccan security services.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/mauritania-gaddafi-senussi-libya\" title=\"\">extradition to Libya</a> of Muammar Gaddafi's spy chief Abdullah al-Senussi brought a rare moment of unity among Lockerbie relatives and campaigners normally deeply split on Libya's role in the bombing.</p> <p>They agreed that Scottish police and prosecutors should make strenuous efforts to question Senussi about his links to or knowledge of the atrocity, which killed 270 people in December 1988. But they disagreed about why.</p> <p>Susan Cohen, whose daughter Theodora, 20, was one of 35 Syracuse University students killed in the bombing, said it would be \"excellent\" if Scottish investigators succeeded in meeting Senussi. \"I would thoroughly urge them to do so,\" she said.</p> <p>In particular, Cohen said, Senussi could confirm the guilt of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the sole person convicted of the bombing, who died of cancer this summer. He could also implicate senior figures in the Gaddafi regime.</p> <p>She said claims by Megrahi's supporters and other Lockerbie relatives that he was innocent and that the atrocity was committed by another state such as Syria or Iran were \"goofball theories\" without any evidence.</p> <p>\"My fear is that everybody would have put Lockerbie on the backburner and not pursue the case,\" she said. \"I don't suspect there's some vast conspiracy and they're afraid of what might come out, but Gaddafi is dead and Megrahi is dead \u2013 it's easier to deal with the present and easier things, so they don't really want to do this.</p> <p>\"It's vital to interview Senussi. I would hope they will be interviewing others. I think it's extremely important that we know. We should know as much as we can and there may be other people [in Libya] who can be indicted \u2013 and if that is the case, we need to do that.\"</p> <p>However, Jim Swire, a senior figure among the British bereaved families, is adamant that Megrahi was innocent. A leading member of the Justice for Megrahi campaign, which is discussing reopening Megrahi's appeal against his conviction with his surviving sons, Swire said there had been theories for some years linking Senussi to Lockerbie.</p> <p>One allegation was that Senussi and Moussa Koussa, the Libyan former foreign minister, who fled Tripoli with the help of western agencies before Gaddafi's death, had taken control of several bombs built by a Palestinian terrorist group, PFLP-GC, that were missed in raids by German police.</p> <p>Moussa Koussa <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/31/lockerbie-bombing-prosecutors-moussa-koussa\" title=\"\">agreed to be interviewed</a> by Dumfries and Galloway police and Crown Office prosecutors early last year, but is thought to have offered very little new information about Lockerbie or Megrahi. Swire said he was sceptical about the theory, but added: \"It's quite possible that Libya played a part in Lockerbie. It's very clear that Megrahi didn't.</p> <p>\"The two people from Gaddafi's regime who seem to be in the frame are Senussi and Moussa Koussa. Moussa Koussa clearly had a relationship with western intelligence because he was allowed to fly to Britain and then the Middle East, where he now lives the life of Reilly. [The] suspicion is that Senussi and Moussa Koussa may have set up the use of those devices for Lockerbie.\"</p> <p>John Ashton, author of Megrahi's authorised biography, You Are My Jury, said other sources believed Senussi was simply a security \"enforcer\" rather than a spymaster of Moussa Koussa's rank. \"Megrahi never hid the fact that he was related to Senussi,\" Ashton said. \"Although he never discussed Sennusi's alleged role in the bombing, he was convinced that Libya \u2013 and therefore Sennusi \u2013 was not responsible for it.</p> <p>\"Western intelligence sources and the US state department always claimed that Senussi was Megrahi's boss. If that's the case then the Scottish police should be moving heaven and earth to get to him. However, I take those claims with a huge pinch of salt, as the evidence against Megrahi is highly flawed. If the police do get to Senussi, they may well be very disappointed.\"</p> <p>Many Libyans will be glad if Senussi is put on trial. Giuma Bukleb, one of a group of writers jailed for life by the Gaddafi regime in 1978, had a personal reason for hoping Senussi would face a public trial in Libya. \"I just want to go and spit in his face,\" he said.</p> <p>Hisham Ben Ghalbon, a Libyan dissident whose house in Manchester was bombed by a Gaddafi hit squad in 1984, said: \"We are all waiting for answers. [Senussi] is one of the very few in the Gaddafi inner circle that know all the answers.\"</p> <p>The Tripoli-based film-maker Huda Abuzeid, whose father, Ali, an opposition activist, was shot dead in London in 1996 on the orders of the Gaddafi regime, said she hoped Libya would put pressure on Qatar for Koussa's extradition. \"Both Senussi and Moussa Kousa, they caused so much pain to so many families, they have the answers that so many people like my family are looking for,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>It is rare these days to read any good news coming out of Pakistan. It is rarer still to read good news concerning matters of religion. However, in one week two stories seem to show that Pakistan is for once bringing the force of law to bear on those who abuse religion to provoke violence against minorities.</p> <p>Last Sunday Mohammed Khalid Chisti, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/02/pakistani-mullah-accused-girl-blasphemy?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=feed\" title=\"\">mullah who had accused a 14-year-old Christian girl, Rimsha Masih, of blasphemy, was himself arrested</a> and charged with the same law. The turnaround took place after the muezzin of his mosque gave evidence that he had framed the girl and falsified evidence. More remarkable still, the far-from- moderate All Pakistan Ulema Council came to Rimsha's defence, calling her \"a daughter of the nation\" and denouncing Chisthi: \"Our heads are bowed with shame for what he did.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday an even more unexpected event took place. <a href=\"http://dawn.com/2012/08/30/lej-chief-malik-ishaq-arrested-in-lahore/\" title=\"\">Malik Ishaq</a>, the leader of the banned Sunni terrorist group Lashkar\u2013e-Jhangvi, which is accused of killing hundreds of Shias, was arrested on his return from a fund-raising trip to Saudi Arabia. Lashkar operates quite openly in Lahore despite being officially banned; yet on this occasion Ishaq was immediately brought to court. There he was accused of involvement in more than 40 cases in which 70 people have been killed. He now resides in Kot Lakhpat jail on 14-day judicial remand.</p> <p>When Pakistan was created in 1947 as a homeland for Indian Muslims, its clean-shaven, tweed-jacketed, spats-wearing and pork-eating founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, made sure the constitution of his new country provided the right for all its citizens to profess, practise and propagate their religion: \"You may belong to any religion, caste or creed,\" he said in his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0UQ6VoceXY\" title=\"\">first address to the constituent assembly of Pakistan</a> on August 11 1947. \"That has nothing to do with the business of the state. In due course of time Hindus will cease to be Hindus and Muslims will cease to be Muslims \u2013 not in a religious sense, for that is the personal faith of an individual \u2013 but in the political sense as citizens of one state.\"</p> <p>It was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who started the rot. In 1974 he bowed to pressure from the religious right and had the country's small <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/28/gunmen-mosques-lahore\" title=\"\">Ahmedi</a> minority declared non-Muslim. The situation became worse still in the 1980s with the military coup of General Zia. Zia was responsible for initiating the fatal alliance between the conservative military and the equally reactionary mullahs that led to the use of Islamic radicals as part of state policy. At the same time Zia started tinkering with the law. He introduced the Islamic punishment of amputation for theft, and established the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/17/pakistan.theobserver\" title=\"\">Hudood ordinances</a> of sharia law, which asserted that the evidence of one man was equal to that of two women, and made any sex outside marriage a punishable offence for women. Rape was to be punished with the public flogging of the female victim as well as the perpetrator.</p> <p>Between 1982 and 1986 Zia introduced radical changes to Pakistan's blasphemy laws \u2013 the notorious <a href=\"http://www.rationalistinternational.net/Shaikh/blasphemy_laws_in_pakistan.htm\" title=\"\">sections 295 B and C of the penal code</a> \u2013 prescribing life imprisonment for anyone who defiles a copy of the Qur'an and death for insulting or criticising the prophet Muhammad. Because there is no strict definition of blasphemy, and virtually no evidence above the word of the accuser is needed to bring a guilty verdict, the laws have often been exploited by individuals with grudges against innocent non-Muslims. In 1988 Bishop John Joseph of Faisalabad publicly committed suicide to protest against the laws; and although no one has yet been executed under the statutes, an estimated 1,200 to 4,000 blasphemy cases have been filed. The number of cases has multiplied in recent years, and the result is often prison sentences of three years or more.</p> <p>Christians are widely derided in Pakistan; most are descended from \"untouchable\" converts who still perform the most menial tasks: cleaning the sewers and sweeping the streets. There has been a steady stream of attacks on the community, most bloodily in the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/28/newsid_2478000/2478093.stm\" title=\"\">murder of 16 Christians at a church in Bahawalpur </a>in 2001. But it is not just Christians who have suffered. Hysteria about blasphemy has also been used to target Hindus, Sikhs, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/jun/07/ahmadi-massacre-silence-pakistan\" title=\"\">Ahmadis</a> and Shias. In addition to formal convictions, there were at least 34 extrajudicial killings of people accused of blasphemy between 1990 and 2010. Of those, 15 were Muslim, 16 Christians, two Ahmadis and a Hindu. Indeed it is the Shias, not the Christians, who have suffered the brunt of the violence meted out by Lashkar\u2013e-Jhangvi.</p> <p>The high-water mark for religious intolerance in Pakistan was reached last year when the former governor of the Punjab, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/14/salmaan-taseer-guard-pleads-guilty\" title=\"\">Salman Taseer</a>, and the only Christian minister in the government, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/02/pakistan-minister-shot-dead-islamabad\" title=\"\">Shahbaz Bhatti</a>, were both shot dead for suggesting that the blasphemy laws should be reviewed. Last week's turnaround seems to represent a dawning realisation that things had gone too far \u2013 that a descent into mob violence was imminent. \"There has been some genuine remorse on the right,\" Pakistan's leading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/21/pakistan.declanwalsh\" title=\"\">human rights lawyer Asma Jahangir</a> told me. \"They realised a line had been crossed.\"</p> <p>This is certainly good news, but it is only a beginning. Rishma remains in custody and Malik Ishaq has yet to be convicted. \"I am not optimistic that the laws will be repealed,\" says Jahangir. \"In fact, you cannot even discuss it.\" While politicians such as Imran Khan have bravely called Rishma's arrest \"shameful ... against the very spirit of Islam\", neither he nor any other major political figure has called for an outright repeal of the blasphemy laws. Nor, given the fate of Salman Taseer, are they likely to any time soon.</p> <p>And as long as the laws remain on the statute books, cases like these will continue to occur, and major injustices will continue to be perpetrated on all of Pakistan's religious minorities.</p>",
  "<p>Police in Quebec were on Wednesday investigating the motives behind a gun attack on the victory party of Quebec's first female premier, which left one man dead and another critically wounded hours after voters in the Canadian province elected a minority separatist government.</p> <p>Canadian politicians condemned the attack, which stunned the province and came at the end of a bitterly divisive election campaign.</p> <p>Pauline Marois, leader of the Parti Quebecois, was minutes in to her victory speech at a party in Montreal on Tuesday night when the gunman opened fire, killing a 45-year-old-man. Two bodyguards bundled Marois off stage when gunfire rattled out.</p> <p>The man, who was wearing a blue bathrobe and a balaclava, was tackled to the ground by police outside the concert hall after he had started a small fire. As he was being arrested, the man allegedly shouted out, repeating twice in French: \"The anglophones are waking up.\"</p> <p>Montreal police identified the gunman as Richard Henry Bain, 62, from Mont Tremblant, a small town in the Laurentian mountains about 80 miles north-west of Montreal. It was not clear whether the suspect was an English or a French speaker \u2013 an important detail after a bitter election campaign fought on cultural and language issues.</p> <p>Marois came back on stage to give a final thank-you to her jubilant supporters before urging them to calmly evacuate the concert hall. <br> At a press conference on Wednesday, Marois said her thoughts were with the family of the victim and that an investigation is under way. Marois said: \"Quebec is a non-violent society. A single act of madness cannot erase this fact.\"</p> <p>Quebec police sergeant Bruno Beaulieu told the Guardian the suspect is in custody and will appear in court on Thursday morning to hear the charges against him.</p> <p>Lieutenant Guy Lapointe told AP that the suspect was taken to a hospital on Wednesday, but that his life was not in danger. \"We can't establish at this point what the motive or intent was. Was he targeting Madame Marois? I'll tell you: a lot of things were said by this individual after they arrested him, in French and English,\" Lapointe said.</p> <p>Before the dramatic interruption to her speech, Marois reaffirmed her party's commitment an independent Quebec. Speaking in French, she said: \"As a nation we want to take decisions that concern us on our own,\" she said. \"The future of Quebec is to become a sovereign country.\"</p> <p>She highlighted the French language as essential to the future of the province, then addressed the anglophone people of Quebec in English, promising to protect them and to forge a shared future together.</p> <p>The PQ is likely to form a minority government after winning fewer seats than required to take power outright, and on a slightly reduced share of the popular vote, just 32%. Preliminary results showed the PQ won 56 of the 125 seats in the provincial legislature, ending nine years of rule by the Liberals.</p> <p>The result leaves questions over whether the PQ will be able to hold its promised referendum on splitting from Canada. It will need the support of another party to form an administration, which is likely to be one of the weakest in the country.</p> <p>The issue of Quebec's sovereignty is contentious in the French-speaking province and the election of the PQ only to minority government may indicate Quebecoise are not ready to face a third referendum. Two previous votes, in 1980 and 1995, were defeated.</p> <p>But Marois may try to press ahead with other proposals, such as expanding Quebec's language Law 101 to prevent francophones and immigrants from attending English-speaking junior colleges. Marois has proposed legislation that would prevent non-French speakers from running for office, and has suggested a secularism charter banning public service employees from wearing overtly religious symbols, like the Jewish yarmulke and the Muslim hijab.</p> <p>The snap election was called after a student strike over raising tuition fees and the Liberal government's crackdown on student protesters caused unrest across the province.</p> <p>Former student strike leader Leo Bureau-Blouin, 20, was elected in his district of Laval for the PQ, making him the youngest elected to the national assembly.</p> <p>Jean Charest, the leader of the federalist Liberal party, which has governed Quebec for the past nine years, was unseated in his own district of Sherbrook, while his party came in second behind the Parti Quebecois.</p> <p>Support for the party leader has waned due to his handling of the student strike, allegations of corruption in the construction industry and passage of Bill 78 \u2013 a widely condemned anti-protest law that brought hundreds of thousands of Quebecois on to the streets during the spring.</p> <p>Marois has promised a tuition freeze until a summit on higher education financing is held, has pledged to repeal Bill 78, and would like to pass a third referendum on Quebec sovereignty. She said on Wednesday: \"I will adopt what it is possible for me to adopt.\" </p> <p>Charest, the ousted Liberal premier, told supporters he accepted responsibility for the defeat. In a riposte to separatism he declared: \"The future of Quebec is in Canada.\"</p> <p>Marois issued a statement Wednesday expressing her sadness at the death of the man shot and saying that her thoughts were with the victim's family.</p> <p>\"Following this tragedy all Quebecois are mourning today after such a gratuitous act of violence,\" she said. \"Never will a society such as ours let violence dictate its collective choices. It is with democracy that we must express ourselves, like people of Quebec were able to do yesterday.\"</p> <p>The Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, who spoke on the phone with Marois in what was described as a \"cordial first contact\",&#xa0;said he was \"angered and saddened\" by the shooting. \"It is a tragic day where an exercise of democracy is met with an act of violence,\" Harper said. \"This atrocious act will not be tolerated and such violence has no place in Canada. Canadians can rest assured that the perpetrator of last night's events will face the full force of the law,\" said Harper.\"<br> The Montreal French-language TV station TVA reported that a man by alerted police about possibility of an attack but claimed not to have been taken seriously. Stephen Guy S\u00e9vigny said he was invited to the victory speech on Facebook by a man whose page was covered with photos of guns and slanderous comments about Marois. He immediately told police \"but they did not take me seriously\" said S\u00e9vigny.</p> <p>S\u00e9vigny said he was too afraid to attend the victory speech, certain there would be an attack. \"I spent the night crying and vomiting,\" he told TVA.</p> <p>Police said there was no evidence yet to show that the threats were linked to the attack.</p>",

Now the next generation of geneticists have updated that picture.</p> <p>The results of the international <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/10005107\" title=\"\">Encode project</a> will have a huge impact for geneticists trying to work out how genes operate. The findings will also provide new leads for scientists looking for treatments for conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and Crohn's disease that have their roots partly in glitches in the DNA. Until now, the focus had largely been on looking for errors within genes themselves, but the Encode research will help guide the hunt for problem areas that lie elsewhere in our DNA sequence.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~birney/\" title=\"\">Dr Ewan Birney, of the European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge</a>, one of the principal investigators in the Encode project, said: \"In 2000, we published the draft human genome and, in 2003, we published the finished human genome and we always knew that was going to be a starting point. We always knew that protein-coding genes were not the whole story.\"</p> <p>For years, the vast stretches of DNA between our 20,000 or so protein-coding genes \u2013 more than 98% of the genetic sequence inside each of our cells \u2013 was written off as \"junk\" DNA. Already falling out of favour in recent years, this concept will now, with Encode's work, be consigned to the history books.</p> <p>Encode is the largest single update to the data from the human genome <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2003/apr/14/genetics.research\" title=\"\">since its final draft was published in 2003</a> and the first systematic attempt to work out what the DNA outside protein-coding genes does. The researchers found that it is far from useless: within these regions they have identified more than 10,000 new \"genes\" that code for components that control how the more familiar protein-coding genes work. Up to 18% of our DNA sequence is involved in regulating the less than 2% of the DNA that codes for proteins. In total, Encode scientists say, about 80% of the DNA sequence can be assigned some sort of biochemical function.</p> <p>Scientists know that while most cells in our body contain our entire genetic code, not all of the protein-coding genes are active. A liver cell contains enzymes used to metabolise alcohol and other toxins, whereas hair cells make the protein keratin. Through some mechanism that regulates its genes, the hair cell knows it should make keratin rather than liver enzymes, and the liver cell knows it should make the liver enzymes and not the hair proteins.</p> <p>\"That control must have been somewhere in the genome, and we always knew that \u2013 for some individual genes \u2013 it was an element sometimes quite far away from the gene,\" said Birney. \"But we didn't have a genome-wide view to this. So we set about working out how we could discover those elements.\"</p> <p>The results of the five-year Encode project are published on Wednesday across 30 papers <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11247\" title=\"\">in the journals Nature</a>, Science, Genome Biology and Genome Research. The researchers have mapped 4m switches in what was once thought to be junk DNA, many of which will help them better understand a range of common human diseases, from diabetes to heart disease, that depend on the complex interaction of hundreds of genes and their associated regulatory elements.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y3V2thsJ1Wc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y3V2thsJ1Wc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"Regulatory elements are the things that turn genes on and off,\" says <a href=\"http://snyderlab.stanford.edu/\" title=\"\">Professor Mike Snyder of Stanford University</a>, who was a principal investigator in the Encode consortium. \"Much of the difference between people is due to the differences in the efficiency of these regulatory elements. There are more variants, we think, in the regulatory elements than in the genes themselves.\"</p> <p>Genes cannot function without these regulatory elements. If regulation goes wrong, malfunctioning genes can cause diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. Errors in the regulation of a gene known as Sonic Hedgehog, for example, are <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/abstract/S0168-9525%2812%2900052-2\" title=\"\">thought to underlie some cases of human polydactyly</a> in which individuals have extra toes or fingers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?afsmith\" title=\"\">Prof Anne Ferguson-Smith, of Cambridge University</a>, said: \"They also have important implications for the growth and development of embryos and foetuses during pregnancy. These are the kinds of elements that make your tissues and organs grow properly, at the right time and place, and containing the right kinds of cells.\"</p> <p>Encode scientists found that 9% of human DNA is involved in the coding for the regulatory switches, although Birney thinks the true figure may turn out to be about 20%. \"One of the big surprises is that we see way more [regulatory] elements than I was expecting,\" he said.</p> <p>The project has identified about 10,000 stretches of DNA, which the Encode scientists have called non-coding genes, that do not make proteins but, instead, a type of RNA \u2013 the single-stranded equivalent of DNA. There are many types of RNA molecule in cells, each with a specific role such as carrying messages or transcribing the DNA code in the first step of making a protein. However, the 10,000 non-coding genes carry instructions to build the large and small RNA molecules required to regulate the actions of the 20,000 protein-coding genes.</p> <p>The results have already shed light on previous, massive studies of genetic data. In recent years, scientists have compared the genetic code of thousands of people with a specific disease (such as diabetes, bipolar disorder, Crohn's disease or heart disease) with the DNA code of thousands of healthy people, in an attempt to locate mutations that could account for some of the risk of developing that disease. These so-called <a href=\"http://gwas.nih.gov/\" title=\"\">genome-wide association studies (GWAS)</a> have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/jun/07/genetics.medicalresearch\" title=\"\">identified scores of locations in the DNA</a> that seem to raise a person's risk of developing a disease \u2013 but the vast majority are nowhere near protein-coding genes. That makes sense if regions previously thought of as \"junk\" are actually vital for controlling the expression of protein-encoding genes.</p> <p>Indeed, there is a big overlap between the locations identified by GWAS and the regulation switches identified in Encode. \"When I first saw that result I thought it was too good to be true. We've done the analysis five different ways now and it still holds up,\" says Birney.</p> <p>Understanding some of these regulatory elements could help explain some of the environmental triggers for different diseases.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Crohns-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx?url=Pages/what-is-it.aspx\" title=\"\">Crohn's disease</a>, for example, is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system and affects up to 60,000 people in the UK, but scientists cannot fully explain why some people suffer from it and others do not, even when they all have the genetic mutations associated with an elevated risk. One hypothesis is that the disease could be triggered by a bacterial infection. \"Maybe there's a place in the middle of nowhere [in the DNA], not close to a protein-coding gene, that if you have one variant you're more sensitive to this bacterium, if you have another variant you're less sensitive,\" says Birney. \"So you get Crohn's disease probably because you have the more sensitive type and that particular bacterial infection occurred at a time when you were vulnerable.\"</p> <p>The Encode consortium's 442 researchers, situated in 32 institutes around the world, used 300 years of computer time and five years in the lab to get their results. They examined a total of 147 types of tissue \u2013 including cancer cells, liver extracts, endothelial cells from umbilical cords, and stem cells derived from embryos \u2013 and subjected them to around a hundred different experiments, recording which parts of the DNA code were activated in which cells at which times.</p> <p>The current and future phases of Encode will prove useful not only for scientists, but also for those who want a more personalised approach to medicine in the decades to come. \"We're in an era where people are starting to get their genomes sequenced. With Encode data we could start mapping regulatory information,\" says Snyder.</p> <p>This means that the individual differences in people's diseases can be more effectively targeted for treatment. \"Diseases have been defined by the medical profession observing symptoms,\" says <a href=\"http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/faculty/thubbard/\" title=\"\">Dr Tim Hubbard of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge</a>. \"[But] we know, for example, that breast cancer is not one disease but there's multiple types of breast cancer with all sorts of different mechanistic processes going wrong.</p> <p>\"A given drug only works in about a third of the people you give it to, but you don't know which third. A lot of that is related to genomics, so if you knew the relationship between a person's genome and which drugs work for them and which ones they shouldn't take because it gives them side effects, that would improve medicine.\"</p> <p>Understanding exactly how each type of cell in the body works \u2013 in other words which genes are switched on or off at different stages of its function \u2013 will also be useful in future stem cell therapies. If doctors want to grow replacement liver tissue, for example, they will be able to check that it is safe by comparing the DNA functions of their manufactured cells with data from normal liver cells.</p> <p>Birney says that the decade since the publication of the first draft of the human genome has shown that genetics is much more complex than anyone could have predicted. \"We felt that maybe life was easier beforehand and more comfortable because we were just more ignorant. The major thing that's happening is that we're losing some of our ignorance and, indeed, it's very complicated,\" he says. \"You've got to remember that these genomes make one of the most complicated things we know, ourselves. The idea that the recipe book would be easy to understand is kind of hubris. I still think we're at the start of this journey, we're still in the warm-up, the first couple of miles of this marathon.\"</p> <h2>Glossary</h2> <p>DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid is the chemical that stores genetic information in our cells.

  "<p>Fourteen years ago, around the time young Rimsha Masih, now in jail under Pakistan's blasphemy law, was born, a Roman Catholic bishop walked into a courthouse in Sahiwal, quite close to my hometown in Central Punjab. The Right Rev John Joseph was no ordinary clergyman; he was the first native bishop in Pakistan and the first ever Punjabi bishop anywhere in the world. He was also a brilliant and celebrated community organiser, the kind of man oppressed communities look up to as a role model. Joseph walked in alone, asking a junior priest to wait outside the courthouse. Inside the court, he took out a handgun and shot himself in the head. The bullet in his head was his protest against the court's decision to sentence a fellow Christian, Ayub Masih, to death for committing blasphemy. Masih had been charged with arguing with a Muslim co-worker over religious matters. The exact content of the conversation cannot be repeated here because that would be blasphemous. The bishop had campaigned long and hard to get the blasphemy law repealed without any luck. He wrote prior to his death: \"I shall count myself extremely fortunate if in this mission of breaking the barriers, our Lord accepts the sacrifice of my blood for the benefit of his people.\"</p> <p>Joseph had been pursuing another case, in which an 11-year-old, Salamat Masih, along with his father and uncle, was accused of scribbling something blasphemous on the wall of the mosque. We don't really know what he wrote, because reproducing it, here or in court, would constitute blasphemy.</p> <p>The boy's uncle, Manzoor Masih, was shot dead during the trial. The Masih case went to the high court, where a judge, Arif Bhatti, applied common sense and released him. A year later the judge was murdered in his own chambers, and his killers claimed that the judge had committed blasphemy by freeing those accused in the blasphemy case.</p> <p>Frustrated and in a fit of rage, the bishop meditated and reached the conclusion that he should kill himself publicly to make his point.</p> <p>You could argue that Joseph should have organised candlelight vigils, gone on a hunger strike, hired better lawyers. But he had tried everything and realised that a bullet in the head in the middle of a court was his only way to draw attention to this colossal absurdity called blasphemy law.</p> <p>He was wrong. The law stayed. Many more Christians were killed.</p> <p>There are situations though, where confronted with the prospect of a 14-year-old being sentenced to death, as a celebrated community leader you can't do anything but take a gun to your head.</p> <p>And hope for the best.</p> <p><strong>How to commit blasphemy in Pakistan</strong></p> <p>A young girl carrying trash in a plastic bag in a slum in the capital of Pakistan is not likely to arouse much curiosity. Not unless the girl is a Christian. Not unless there is a Muslim boy who wants to inspect the contents of her bag. Then this certain young man, Hammad, takes the trash bag to the local mosque to show it to the imam, Hafiz Mohammed Khalid Chishti (also known as Maulana Jadoon), who decides that the contents of the bag are, indeed, blasphemous but wonders if they are blasphemous enough. So he inserts some pages of the Qur'an in the trash bag. What the girl was carrying was a book of alphabets, taught to children, may or may not have had a verse from the Qur'an in it. Reproducing an image of the contents of this trash bag would be blasphemous, so we are never likely to know. We discover the imam's role in sexing up the blasphemous contents two weeks later when one of the imam's deputies cracks up. By then Rimsha has been arrested, refused bail, sent to jail and a medical board constituted to ascertain her age and mental health. We are still not sure if she is 11 or 14, we don't know if she has Down's Syndrome as was originally claimed. In the initial days of the case, human-rights workers pinned their hopes on Rimsha's mental condition. As if those who demanded her arrest, those who arrested her, those who denied her bail and put her in jail were all mentally \"normal\". Her family has gone into hiding; another 300 Christian families have been forced to leave their homes and are struggling to find shelter in one of the Islamabad forests.</p> <p>So what can constitute blasphemy under the blasphemy law, which has killed dozens in the past decade, made thousands homeless and millions live in permanent fear about what might be found in their trashcan. It's up to the lawyers to argue over how to avoid: \"Whoever by words, either spoken or written or by visible representation, or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles \u2026\" but here are some of the everyday situations that can turn you into a blasphemer:</p> <p><strong>1. </strong>Transporting ashes in a plastic bag to a rubbish dump, as has happened in Masih's case.</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>Discussing conjugal rights according to Islam with fellow Muslims if you disagree with them. You might think you are with a fellow Muslim, around a water pump and relatively safe. That is what a schoolteacher in Chakwal thought. And got into an argument. He has been in jail for the past 10 months. His 14-year-old daughter told the daily newspaper Dawn last week that kids won't talk to her because her father is a blasphemer.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Not minding your spellings. Last year a teacher checking exam papers called in the police after he found blasphemous material in an answer sheet. The police wouldn't reveal the exact material because that, you know, would be blasphemous. Later it transpired that it was a case of bad spelling.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Writing a novel called Blasphemy. Last year there were calls to put an author on trial because she had been disrespectful to religious scholars and spiritual saints. Last I heard she was fine but not writing any more novels with any other name.</p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Writing a children's poem with a lion as its central character. Pakistan's most famous social activist, Akhtar Hameed Khan, who spent his life helping people in Asia's largest slum, tried his hand at a poem like that and spent his last years in courts facing blasphemy charges.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Refusing someone a drink of water. Asia Bibi, a Christian woman, who among other blasphemous things (which can't be repeated for reasons by now obvious to the readers of this article) refused her co-workers a drink of water. The local imam accused her of blasphemy. The then governor, Salman Taseer, came out in her support, talked about changing the law, and was killed by his own police bodyguard. The policeman's picture adorns many shops and businesses in Pakistan. Taseer's name has become synonymous with \"going too far\". And nobody, really nobody, wants to mention Bibi's name in a discussion about blasphemy law.</p> <p><strong>7. </strong>Throwing away a visiting card. A doctor in Hyderabad did that to a pestering pharmaceutical salesman and found himself in serious trouble. The salesman had Muhammad as part of his name.</p> <p><strong>Blasphemy: a children's story</strong></p> <p>An academic subject called Islamic Studies was made compulsory for all students in the early 80s. As a student you were taught a story about the prophet Muhammad's life. It was part of Muslim folklore, repeated over and over again in Friday sermons, and told to little kids as a bedtime story. When the prophet started preaching in Mecca, there was a lot of hostility towards him. People pelted him with stones, made fun of him and his new upstart God and his teachings. There was one woman in his Mecca neighbourhood who was particularly nasty to him. As he left his house every day, she would be waiting for him with a basket of garbage that she would empty over him. It happened day after day but he never rebuked the woman, nor changed his path. Then one day he walked the street and no garbage was thrown at him. He turned back and went looking for his tormentor and discovered that the woman was ill and bedridden. He inquired about her health and told her that since she hadn't come out to insult him like she did every day, he was worried about her. The woman, impressed by his generosity, converted to Islam.</p> <p>There is another story that kids are taught these days. This story has almost become the new folklore, repeated endlessly on social networking sites and narrated in graphic detail by the supporters of the blasphemy law. According to this story when prophet Muhammad conquered Mecca he announced a general amnesty except for those who had committed blasphemy against his person. He ordered them to be beheaded. One blasphemer was killed even when he tried to take shelter in the Khana Qaba in Mecca, the most sacred place for Muslims, where it is strictly forbidden to kill anyone.</p> <p>A common Muslim might be puzzled over how both these stories could be true? But before puzzlement starts to border on blasphemy, one must seek the guidance of Pakistani Islamic scholars, who tell us that Islam is the most humane of religions, that there is nothing wrong with the blasphemy law, that it is the implementation which is problematic. Before the current law came into existence, in 60 years there were six reported cases of blasphemy. Since the current law was constituted there have been more than four thousand. But the law has such power that even pleading the statistics is considered blasphemous. When Governor Taseer challenged it, they killed him, and then many of the same Islamic scholars refused to say his funeral prayers.</p> <p><strong>The fear of Allah v the fear of mullah</strong></p> <p>Not too long ago, the role of the clergy in a neighbourhood was confined to birth and deaths, funeral and special religious occasions. You went to the mosque to offer your prayers, you prayed for better crops, for the rains to start or stop; travellers could expect to find shelter for the night. A mosque is no more just that. Equipped with a powerful public-address system and controlled by sectarian religious groups, it's become a little battle headquarter for the neighbourhood. The continuous Shia massacres across Pakistan are not hatched in some far-off land, by enemies of Pakistan or enemies of Islam as Pakistan's maulanas pretend; they are preached, planned and executed from local mosques.</p> <p>People listen to religious scholars.</p> <p>\"If she is innocent, she should be released,\" thundered a dozen maulanas on TV screens after Rimsha was arrested. \"And if she is guilty, the law must take its course.\" They completely ignored the fact that an illiterate child is not likely to even know what constitutes blasphemy. And the law they want to be implemented has led to a situation that even when the accused is found innocent, they are condemned for life.</p> <p>All you need to do to condemn someone for life is to switch on a mosque loudspeaker and make the allegation. Before Chishti was caught in his own trap in the Rimsha case, no accuser had ever been arrested or tried. The laws against hate speech are weak, and almost never implemented. And how can it be considered hate speech when all they are doing is expressing their faith that might include demanding death for all Shias and Ahmedis, and an occasional Christian who may or may not have crossed the line.</p> <p>There are enough sectarian organisations in Pakistan to wage perpetual war. There are enough factions within these organisations that will shoot down every argument, every appeal to rationality. You can't reason with Allah, so you mustn't reason with a mullah, because that too might be blasphemous.</p> <p>A few days before it was found that Chishti had planted evidence against Rimsha, he was interviewed on TV. He was asked if he had been campaigning to expel Christians from his neighbourhood. He seemed puzzled for a moment, then rebuked: \"This is a Muslim country, Allah has given it to us. If these Christians make noise at the time of our prayers, then they should be asked to leave.\" I am certain that even when Chishti was stuffing pages from the Qur'an in the poor girl's trash bag, he believed he was doing Allah's work.</p> <p><strong>The Christian work</strong></p> <p>There is a well-off Christian businessman in Karachi who fusses over the trash basket in his office, handles his work file carefully, because, you never know, a stray scrap of paper can ruin you, your family, your business.</p> <p>Christians make up less than 2% of Pakistanis, the majority of them very poor. Many of them are converts from low caste Hindus, who embraced Christianity in the hope of better status, but most end up sweeping the streets and cleaning clogged up gutters. Because of rampant unemployment the sanitary profession is not exclusive to Christians any more \u2013 there are thousands of Muslims, mostly migrants from rural areas, who sweep the streets and haul the trash but because of old prejudices, it's still considered a profession beneath Muslims. The Christian businessman in Karachi was hiring a cleaning person for his office and inquired about his background. The candidate told him: my family comes from farming but because of bad times we are forced to do this Christian work.</p> <p><strong>My father, the blasphemer</strong></p> <p>My father was as devout and zealous a Muslim as I have ever seen. Never missed a prayer, built a huge mosque in his village and always preferred the stricter, literalist version of religion. He also had a mysterious stomach ailment and the only cure was a verse from the Qur'an recited by the only Christian gentleman in the neighbourhood. This accidental healer was also the neighbourhood sweeper. When I think of these two old men huddled in a room, reciting verses from the Qur'an to cure a minor ailment, I wonder if they were committing blasphemy?</p> <p><strong>Rimsha's future</strong></p> <p>For the first time since the Right Rev John Joseph shot himself, there is some public support for a blasphemy victim. Some religious scholars have come out in Rimsha's support, an odd politician or two have talked about this case becoming a tipping point in the blasphemy debate. But let's not have any illusions: no political party has the courage to rewrite a single word in the law let alone repeal it. The 11-year-old Salamat Masih who Joseph had fought for was sentenced to death. A higher court later overturned the decision but it was obvious the boy would never be safe in the country. A Christian charity helped him find asylum in Europe.</p> <p>Rimsha (if found not guilty) has been offered sanctuary by one of the country's largest seminaries, Jamia Banuria, in Karachi. Banuria is also a staunch supporter of the blasphemy law. Rimsha probably doesn't know that she might end up spending the rest of her life in a Muslim seminary or be left at the mercy of a Christian charity.</p> <p>In Joseph's hometown in Faisalabad, in a Muslim seminary called Jamia Rehmania, they made a monument to his sacrifice. Jamia Rehmania also supports the blasphemy law. The memorial, called Bishop John Joseph Memorial Hall is the only monument in Pakistan dedicated to a blasphemer.</p>",
  "<p>Not long ago, Frances O'Grady was leafing through some old union pamphlets, created by car industry workers in the 1970s. Her father was a shop steward at the British Leyland car plant in Cowley back then, when the company was synonymous with <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/archive/2011/06/16/Features+(otfeatures)/9081181.Recalling_turbulent_times/\" title=\"\">industrial unrest</a>, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4294709.stm\" title=\"\">mass walkouts</a>, furious disputes between a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/business/economy/18car.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">failing management</a> and the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/693309.stm\" title=\"\">union</a>. The workers were sometimes publicly denegrated.</p> <p>But in a 1978 pamphlet, the extent of their interest in innovation and the strength of their ideas was clear. \"There was this whole section about how the Japanese were working on a prototype for an electric car,\" she says, and the workers suggested the British car industry invest in developing its own, citing, among other arguments, the environmental benefits. The suggestion was apparently ignored. \"Imagine if somebody had listened to them 30 years ago,\" says O'Grady. \"Britain could have been a market leader.\"</p> <p>Stories such as this stoke her belief in workers being given a proper voice in their industries. \"Because working people have a lot of intelligence and ideas and imagination and vision.\" I snort loudly, involuntarily, at this, then apologise. It's not that I disagree \u2013 not at all \u2013 just that it suddenly seems so ridiculous that it should still be necessary to make this case. Of course you're better off harnessing the ideas of your whole workforce, rather than a tiny number of&#xa0;people at the top, who often have very similar backgrounds, outlooks and intimacies.</p> <p>O'Grady laughs uproariously too. She has worked for the unions for more than two decades, and has the ready laughter of a seasoned campaigner, whose sense of humour has kept her going. \"But there's something very deeply held, isn't there,\" she says, \"that somehow one little group of people, whether it's in politics or business, has all the answers \u2026 Ordinary people who have lots of good ideas want more than a suggestion box, and they need a union to represent that thinking.\"</p> <p>This coming week, O'Grady's mission to give workers a voice reaches its height as she becomes the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/10/frances-ogrady-tuc-general-secretary\" title=\"\">general secretary designate</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tuc\" title=\"\">Trade Union Congress</a> \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18772379\" title=\"\">first woman</a> to be elected leader in the TUC's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/11/tuc-leader-frances-ogrady-challenge\" title=\"\">144-year history</a>. She takes over officially from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/brendan-barber\" title=\"\">Brendan Barber</a> at the end of the year, heading a body that represents <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/tuc/unions_main.cfm\" title=\"\">54 trade unions</a>, with nearly 6.5 million members, almost half of whom are women. Elected unopposed, her appointment has been hailed as the end of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/05/women-changing-union-movement-tuc\" title=\"\">\"male, pale and stale\"</a> era of union leaders, a progressive, none-too-soon step forward.</p> <p>At the start of our interview, I'm not quite sure what to make of O'Grady. When I ask about the three highest priorities for union members, her answer is wide-ranging \u2013 touching on austerity, a stimulus package, decent jobs, dead-end jobs, unpaid internships, bogus training schemes, growing inequality and stagnating living standards. All the right noises, all slightly waffly. Thankfully, it's a blip. O'Grady passes that classic politician's test \u2013 would you want to have a drink with them? \u2013 with distinction, while also being pointed and clever.</p> <p>She'll need to be. Her appointment comes at a time when union numbers <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/t/12-p77-trade-union-membership-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">are in year-on-year decline</a>; the ranks of paid-up members have halved from their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/30/union-membership-data\" title=\"\">13 million peak</a> in the late 70s. Yet arguments around employment rights and treatment of workers are more contentious than ever, with new employment scandals each week, from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19263787\" title=\"\">zero-hours contracts</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/28/workfare-uk-plot-job-snobs\" title=\"\">\"workfare\"</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/19/minimum-wage-frozen-for-under-21s\" title=\"\">freezing of the minimum wage</a> for young people. A group of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/17/tory-backbenchers-urge-welfare-reforms\" title=\"\">ambitious Tory MPs</a> recently claimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">\"the British are among the worst idlers in the world\"</a>; a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/22/vince-cable-tory-plan-sacking-workers?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">report</a> by Tory donor Adrian Beecroft proposed making it easier to sack employees without explanation; and last year it was reported that David Cameron's former policy honcho, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/28/steve-hilton-policies-coalition-split\" title=\"\">Steve Hilton</a>, had suggested abolishing maternity leave altogether. The sharpness of the arguments is clear on one of the first pages of the <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/the_tuc/tuc-21274-f0.cfm\" title=\"\">TUC's preliminary agenda</a>, the document that presents possible motions for debate. One statement reads: \"Congress believes that increasing unemployment, and particularly youth unemployment, is a deliberate policy aim of this government.\"</p> <p>Where does she stand on that? O'Grady emphasises that these are just potential motions. \"But there was certainly a strong view in the 1980s, not just among trade unions, but also among a number of intellectuals and commentators, that unemployment was being used as a deliberate measure to keep pay down, and to keep people scared. As long as the number one worry for people, keeping them up at nights, is whether they're going to have a job in the morning, then they are less likely to resist unfair changes, or unfair treatment, or cuts in real pay at work. So there's a fair bit of evidence to suggest it can be a deliberate policy. And I think we do legitimately have to ask why the government isn't taking action to create decent employment for young people, when the evidence is that if you <em>don't</em> do that, you really are going to pay a very high price.\"</p> <p>This isn't the only area where O'Grady suspects there may be ideological forces at work. We talk about the increasingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/10242141\" title=\"\">temporary, part-time</a> nature of the labour market, which has created a workforce that's much more difficult to unionise. \"If you were very cynical,\" she says, \"you might think it was a deliberate strategy.\" Then there's the evidence that women are bearing the brunt of the recession, with women's unemployment reaching a 25-year high earlier in 2012. \"You'd be forgiven for thinking that this was part of a back-to-the-kitchen-sink campaign,\" she says. \"When you look at what's happening, with women being hit hardest by job losses, service cuts, threats to take away employment rights, pay depression, rising bills and lack of childcare \u2026 You could be forgiven for thinking that there is a plan here.\"</p> <p>Now 52, her work in the union movement began at the Transport and General Workers Union, on campaigns for a national minimum wage and equal pay for women, before she moved to the TUC in the mid-90s. It's now more than 40 years since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/02/made-in-dagenham-a-feminist-view\" title=\"\">the Ford sewing machinists' strike</a>, which led to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/08/four-decades-on-equal-pay-yet-to-come\" title=\"\">Equal Pay Act</a>, yet the pay gap between men and women persists. O'Grady says tackling this has to remain a priority, not just for women, but for all workers. \"I think people understand that as long as working people can be divided up, we're weaker. So it's important for all of us to tackle unfairness, so we can't be divided, one against the other, and actually that applies as much to agency workers, to migrant workers who are often on agency contracts, [who are] paid below the rates. People understand that actually it's not the worker who's the problem,\" she says, \"it's exploitation.\"</p> <p>O'Grady is the youngest of five siblings. Did that give her a feeling for the underdog, the sense she had to shout loudly for recognition? \"Oh, I think we all had to, to be fair,\" she says. \"Small house, big family.\" She has three older sisters and one older brother. The four girls had to share a bedroom, while their brother had another. I commiserate, and she quickly corrects me. \"The house was effectively two bedrooms, with literally a box room that took my brother's bed, which he sometimes had to share with my grandad. So I think we got the better end of the bargain!\"</p> <p>She was put up a year at school, and went to Milham Ford comprehensive in Oxford, where she had \"a bit of a gob\" on her, she says. At the same time, in her late teens, she entered the workplace for the first time, with a job at Marks &amp; Spencer. Even though the company did not recognise unions, she joined one. \"I think it was about self-respect, and feeling that we had a right to a voice.\"</p> <p>She worked at a newsagents at the weekend, where the papers gave her a political education, and then started doing a couple of evenings of silver-service waitressing each week at the Oxford colleges. She was soon pulled off this shift \u2013 if she hadn't mutinied already, it sounds like this was imminent. \"It is a great education [working at] Oxford and I'm sure Cambridge too, in that you're exposed to elites that you maybe wouldn't get to see in other places. The thing that really struck me was that I knew I had a brain in my head, and of course, like the entire family, I have strong opinions. You'd get the chance, serving people, to listen in on these conversations, and in some ways you're desperate to put in your two penn'orth. But, also, you know that you are absolutely invisible to them.</p> <p>\"That's why, you know, some of our&#xa0;unions have run these campaigns organising cleaners at Canary Wharf, and elsewhere, and one of the demands has been that the boss should smile at the cleaner. So yes, provide a living wage \u2026\" But also acknowledge the person? \"Exactly. And I think that's really important. I think it's actually probably one of the most subversive demands to put, because it says: treat me like a human being.\"</p> <p>A teacher encouraged her to go to&#xa0;university, and she headed to Manchester, to study history and politics. While there, she became a feminist \u2013 still is \u2013 and went clubbing regularly at new wave venues. It was the end of the 70s, \"a very exciting time, and then, bang, into the 80s, and that was like having a bucket of cold water thrown over everybody \u2026 Suddenly it's back to who you know, and mass unemployment and unions as the enemy within. I fear there are some now, in the backwaters, who'd like to replay that, on the right.\"</p> <p>She had a series of dead-end jobs, including peeling buckets of onions in&#xa0;a fast-food joint, before moving to London and getting into the voluntary sector. Soon she was working in the union movement, while bringing up her two children \u2013 a daughter and a&#xa0;son&#xa0;\u2013 as a single mother.</p> <p>Now, as TUC leader, she wants to build \"a mass movement, a social movement as well as a trade union movement and, particularly for young people, I think we have to offer a home\". She says Ed Miliband, as Labour leader, has been asking the right questions, but needs to go beyond that. \"He's set out themes \u2013 such as responsible capitalism, living standards, a new way of doing politics \u2013 that resonate with ordinary working people. The people I talk to, going around the country, now have an appetite to hear what the answers are. Because I don't think people will be content with a bit of make-do-and-mend. I think people are looking for something that addresses the root causes of the crash and offers them some hope for the future.\"</p> <p>Is there anything she thinks the coalition government is doing particularly well? She pauses, and erupts with laughter. \"How long have I got to think this one through? Of course there are areas where we have constructive engagement, and our job is to represent working people, so we want a constructive relationship \u2026 But the big picture is that they're pursuing a programme of cuts that is dragging the country down and isn't working, and they urgently need to change course.\" She refers to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/14/osborne-austerity-270000-public-sector-jobs\" title=\"\">270,000</a> public-sector job losses last year, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/25/public-sector-workforce-shrink-record-low-2017\" title=\"\">700,000</a> expected to go, in total, during this current parliament. \"Critically important jobs, from the Border Agency to care services to nurses and doctors. This is self-harm on a massive scale.\"</p> <p>The TUC had a protest against coalition cuts last year, and around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/blog/2011/mar/26/march-for-the-alternative-live-updates\" title=\"\">500,000 </a>people came out. Another protest is planned for <a href=\"http://afuturethatworks.org/\" title=\"\">20 October</a>. O'Grady says she hopes this will send \"a strong message that the great majority of people have lost faith in the government's approach to deficit reduction. I&#xa0;mean, it's plain for all to see. We've got the first double-dip recession since the 70s, the biggest squeeze on living standards since the 20s \u2026 It isn't working, but it's going beyond saying it&#xa0;isn't working to saying, here are some practical alternatives.

Whether we can do that in the time limit is quite doubtful.\"</p> <p>Henry said the process was \"hugely disruptive\" and was causing a number of financial problems, especially as his students had been awarded scholarships by the university.</p> <p>Francis Owobiyi, 28, from Nigeria, who is studying for an MA in international law, said he was considering taking legal action against the UKBA. Owobiyi, who is also an executive officer at LMU's student union, said he had a month of study left and had completed his dissertation but was told by university staff that he would not be able to submit it.</p> <p>'The thought that I may not be able to get my certificate after one year of studying is unbelievable.</p> <p>\"[I am] thinking about personal legal action ... At the end of the day, these services that have been fully paid for have not been rendered,\" he said.</p> <p>A 24-year-old female student from Iran held a placard reading, \"Stop Revocation\". The English undergraduate, who did not wish to give her name, said that she had two years left of study and that the university assured her she could transfer elsewhere but had yet been unable to help her.</p> <p>\"I have to find other admissions in other universities by myself. I have spent lots of money as well with the Border Agency ... My family are upset now, because they have to send money for me again, to start again. It's very difficult.\"</p> <p>Speaking to the gathered crowd, Ayoola Onifade, president of LMU's student union said, \"We are not illegal immigrants\" adding that he and other students would \"refuse to abide\" with the Home Office ruling.</p> <p>Daniel Stevens, the NUS's International Students officer, from Brazil, told demonstrators that the UK was treating international students like criminals.</p> <p>\"I live in fear every single day of the UKBA. I live in fear that I will make one mistake on an application form and that will be it. I live in fear that I've done something wrong. The truth is that international students in the UK are being treated like criminals.\"</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;This article was corrected on 6 September 2012 because the original said Francis Owobiyi is considering taking legal action against the university.

  "<p>More than 3,000 striking South African miners marched through the streets of Marikana on Wednesday, threatening to kill colleagues who continued working and to burn down a Lonnmin mine shaft.</p> <p>It was the biggest protest since last month's police massacre which claimed 34 lives, the bloodiest incident involving security forces since the end of racial apartheid in 1994.</p> <p>Tensions ran high as the workers, waving sticks, knobkerries and tree branches and easily outnumbering police, marched on the Karee mine and vowed to bring Lonmin to its knees.</p> <p>The striking miners gave working colleagues a deadline of 1pm to leave Karee mine or face deadly retribution. \"After one we don't want to see anybody in the shaft,\" said one striker who refused to give his name. \"Those who come to work tomorrow we will kill them.\"</p> <p>Another man shouted: \"There will be more blood if we do not get 12,500 rand.\"</p> <p>Following an intervention by two Methodist ministers, a delegation of seven workers were led past armoured police cars and a water cannon truck to the Karee mine. The group \u2013 all black \u2013 conversed through a barbed wire gate with mine managers and security guards \u2013 all but one of them white.</p> <p>After the brief meeting, one of the workers, Samkele Mpapani, 36, said: \"We told the management to please close the shaft by 1pm. I don't want more guys to die. This shaft has not been listening to the employees.\"</p> <p>Jan Thirion, a senior manager at the shaft, claimed the men had threatened to kill everyone there. \"The delegation from the strikers told me that if I didn't get all the workers out of the shaft by 1pm they would burn down the shaft,\" he said. \"We want to talk peace; they want to talk war.</p> <p>\"I pleaded with them to come back to work. Let us sign the peace accord that's being worked on now because it's not to anybody's advantage to do what they're doing.\"</p> <p>The strike was setting a dangerous precedent, Thirion added. \"It's like putting a gun at someone's head, saying, 'Pay us first, then we'll come back to work.' From here on, if you say that, you might as well close all South Africa's mines.\"</p> <p>A line of police armoured personnel carriers stood between the green-roofed Karee mine complex and the throng of singing, dancing strikers and their supporters. Riot police armed with teargas and assault rifles kept watch while police helicopters hovered overhead.</p> <p>One man at the front of the column waved a placard that said: \"We want 12,500 or nothing else,\" a reference to the group's demand for a hike in base pay to 12,500 rand (\u00a3935) a month, more than double their current basic salary.</p> <p>Some waved a photograph of a young man they named as <a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/he-died-fighting-for-workers-rights-1.1371907#.UEeRgb8pRqe\" title=\"\">Noki Mgcineni</a>, who was killed in the police massacre. Xolani Mzuzu, a striking miner, said: \"We consider him a hero, like Chris Hani,\" \u2013 a reference to a murdered leader of the anti-apartheid struggle.</p> <p>The marchers retreated after a two-hour standoff and proceeded through the town of Marikana, watched by shopkeepers, schoolchildren and other curious onlookers. There was no violence.</p> <p>Demonstrators interviewed by the Guardian insisted the dispute was not about politics or union rivalry but simply pay. Noima Jack, 29, said: \"Lonmin is undermining the workers. They say they are transparent and respect the workers but they do neither.\"</p> <p>The strike by rock drill operators and other miners is now in its fourth week and is threatening to cripple London-based Lonmin. Only 4.2% of its shift workers reported for duty on Wednesday. Lonmin has warned that the strike could cost 40,000 jobs if it continues.</p> <p>Both Marikana and Karee, about 80 miles north-west of Johannesburg, have been closed since thousands of rock drillers went on a wildcat strike and protest nearly four weeks ago that led to the 16 August police crackdown.</p> <p>Marikana accounts for the vast majority of the platinum output of Lonmin, which itself accounts for 12% of global supply of the precious metal used in jewellery and vehicle catalytic converters.</p> <p>The strike has raised fears that the labour unrest which has hit the platinum belt this year could spread to the gold sector. South Africa is home to 80% of known platinum reserves and is the world's fourth-largest gold producer.</p> <p>Talks between Lonmin management, unions and the government to ease tensions and get the striking miners back resumed in the nearby city of Rustenburg.</p> <p>About 50 miners charged with murder after the tragedy were freed on Monday. Around another 220 still in police custody are expected to be released on Thursday.</p>",
  "<p>Louisiana is investigating whether tar balls deposited on Gulf of Mexico beaches by Hurricane Isaac were relics of the 2010 BP oil disaster.</p> <p>Government agencies and environmental groups this week reported weathered oil in areas which took the brunt of last week's hurricane \u2013 and which were also heavily damaged by the 4.9m barrel gusher from BP's leaking oil well.</p> <p>\"I'd say there is a smoking gun,\" Garrett Graves, the coastal adviser to Louisiana's governor Bobby Jindal, told news organisations. \"It's an area that experienced heavy oiling during the spill.\"</p> <p>State officials shut down commercial fishing and all shrimping in a 13-mile stretch from Port Fourchon to Caminada Pass, after observing tar mats and high concentration of tar balls on beaches.</p> <p>The Gulf Restoration Network, which has been touring the aftermath of Isaac by air and boat this week, said crew had reported 109 dead pelican in the wake of the storm and oil in a number of locations on the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts.</p> <p>\"We saw a fair amount of oil sheen and fresh tar balls at Ship Island, one of the Mississippi barrier islands,\" said Aaron Viles, a spokesman for the coalition of environmental groups. \"The storm really delivered a shock to the ecosystem, and we are seeing BP oil showing up again and we are seeing, unfortunately, real impacts to an ecosystem still struggling to recover.\"</p> <p>The Gulf network had repeatedly warned that powerful storms risked dredging up oil that had been purposely sunk to the ocean floor, by the use of chemical dispersants in the wake of the BP oil spill.</p> <p>\"When a storm system comes through it re-exposes oil that has settled to the bottom or was buried under sediment, and that newly re-exposed oil is showing up in places that had a lot of oil during the BP spill,\" Viles said.</p> <p>The oil company said the high number of offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico made it impossible to tie the tar mats to the runaway BP well without comprehensive testing.</p> <p>The US coastguard is investigating about 90 reported cases of oil and chemical leaks following Isaac, including suspected leaks from offshore platforms and a vacated storage terminal at Myrtle Grove.</p> <p>Environmental groups have warned of damage to wetlands and a citrus grove from an oil spill from a Conoco Phillips refinery in Plaquemines Parish, which took a battering in Isaac.</p> <p>There was also a chemical release in Braithwaite, where two people were killed in flooding.</p> <p>The coastguard has sent oil samples to it lab in Connecticut for testing, officials said.</p> <p>BP said in its statement that it would be \"premature\" to draw any conclusions about the sources of the oil before tests came back.</p> <p>\"It is important to fingerprint the residual oil to determine its origin. If any of it is connected to the Deepwater Horizon accident, BP stands ready to remove it,\" the oil company said.</p>",
  "<p>One of the new ministerial appointees to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has previously been highly critical of the government's key policy decision to axe \u00a3350m from the civil legal aid budget.</p> <p>Helen Grant, Conservative MP for Maidstone and The Weald, practised as a legal aid solicitor for 20 years and established her own firm in Croydon helping clients through family and social welfare cases. On Tuesday, she was made a justice minister.</p> <p>Writing for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/02/legal-aid-last-line-defence\" title=\"\">the Guardian's law website last year</a>, as the green paper on legal aid began its passage through the Commons, Grant declared: \"Our country's financial health is a priority, but not at the cost of basic social justice.</p> <p>\"It cannot be right that those most in need of support are left without it \u2026 We must ensure we protect those most vulnerable here at home and treat this debate with the care it deserves.\" She eventually voted for the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act after it was altered through successive amendments.</p> <p>Grant, 50, who has a Nigerian father and English mother, should be able to defend herself ably in political infighting: she was under-16 judo champion for the north of England and Scotland. She was briefly a member of the Labour party before becoming the Conservative party's first black female MP. She has worked with Iain Duncan Smith's Centre for Social Justice.</p> <p>Grant also has a broader responsibility, leading on equality and women's rights issues across the coalition government. Ministerial portfolios within the MoJ are still being allocated.</p> <p>Jeremy Wright, 39, a barrister and Conservative MP for Kenilworth and Southam since 2005, was a government whip before becoming a justice minister. He specialised in criminal cases, appearing for both prosecution and defence. As an MP, he was founder of the all-party group on dementia.</p> <p>The arrival of two lawyers at the MoJ may be a balancing act to support the new secretary of state, Chris Grayling, who is the first person without a legal background to become lord chancellor since 1558.</p> <p>Grayling, a former BBC news producer who studied history at Cambridge, was initially a member of the SDP before joining the Conservatives. Elected MP for Epsom and Ewell in Surrey since 2001, he was previously minister of state at the Department for Work and Pensions.</p> <p>The one MoJ minister to survive the reshuffle is Lord McNally, 69, the Liberal Democrat peer who piloted legal aid cuts through the upper chamber.</p> <p>Another new arrival is the Conservative MP Damian Green who moves over from immigration at the Home Office to take over policing and criminal justice issues from Nick Herbert. He, like Herbert before him, is expected to work for both the MoJ and Home Office.</p> <p>Although Ken Clarke is no longer justice secretary, it appears that as cabinet minister without portfolio he will retain responsibility for pushing the controversial justice and security bill \u2013 which expands the roles of secret courts \u2013 through the Commons.</p> <p>Commenting on the unusual development, the executive director of the charity Reprieve, Clare Algar, said: \"David Cameron needs to come clean on why it is that he feels the [new] secretary of state for justice should not be responsible for a major piece of justice legislation.\"</p> <p>The former justice ministers Crispin Blunt, Jonathan Djanogly and Herbert are understood to have returned to the back benches. The barrister Oliver Heald has replaced Edward Garnier QC as solicitor general.</p>",
  "<p>Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, has sharply criticised the government's \"snooper's charter\", designed to track internet, text and email use of all British citizens, as \"technologically incompetent\".</p> <p>He said Wikipedia would move to encrypt all its connections with Britain if UK internet companies, such as Vodafone and Virgin Media, were mandated by the government to keep track of every single page accessed by UK citizens.</p> <p>The entrepreneur said he was confident there would be a general move to encryption across the internet if British-based communication service providers were required to collect and store data for 12 months from overseas companies, such as Google and Facebook, for possible access by the police and security services.</p> <p>He said the British government would have to resort to the \"black arts\" of hacking to break encryptions: \"It is not the sort of thing I'd expect from a western democracy. It is the kind of thing I would expect from the Iranians or the Chinese and it would be detected immediately by the internet industry,\" he told MPs and peers.</p> <p>His intervention came as leading UK internet companies, including Vodafone and Virgin Media, also raised concerns about the responsibility for retaining and storing sensitive data from overseas third-party companies, which, they said, would damage their commercial relationships and entail a competitive disadvantage.</p> <p>The internet industry, which is giving evidence to a parliamentary special select committee on the draft communications data bill, said the legislation could create new opportunities for hackers and \"malicious agents\" wanting sensitive private information about individuals.</p> <p>The London Internet Exchange (Linx), told MPs it had serious concerns that the proposals would create a \"profiling engine\", a filtering system that would produce detailed profiles on all users of electronic communications systems and allow sophisticated data mining.</p> <p>In a written submission Linx said it would be a challenge to safeguard this profiling engine, and that a breach would be \"a significant threat to national security\".</p> <p>The organisation stated that the profiling engine amounted to \"an enormously powerful tool for public authorities\". Its submission said: \"Its mere existence significantly implicates privacy rights, and its extensive use would represent a dramatic shift in the balance between personal privacy and the capabilities of the state to investigate and analyse the citizen.\"</p> <p>The \u00a31.8bn scheme will require UK-based internet and phone providers to retain and store for 12 months the \"traffic data\" \u2013 who sent what, to whom, from where \u2013 of every British citizen's internet, text and mobile phone use. The move would exclude the contents of messages.</p> <p>The Home Office has admitted it cannot force foreign companies like Google and Facebook to store and hand over sensitive personal data. Instead it is hoping for voluntary agreements. But the legislation includes powers to require British communication firms to collect and store third-party data that cross their networks.</p> <p>Home Office security officials estimate that the rapidly evolving nature of the internet stops them tracking up to 25% of communications data despite such information being used as evidence in the majority of terrorist and serious crime cases. Internet and phone companies currently only keep data collected for their own business billing.</p> <p>The Internet Service Providers Association said the government estimated that this \"gap\" could be cut by 10% and questioned whether this was sufficient to justify the proposals or whether it represented value for money.</p>",
  "<p>The news that the first and only Muslim Asian woman in politics from the north of England has been moved out of the Coalition cabinet in the mid-term reshuffle comes as no surprise to those of us in Bradford and West Yorkshire more widely who have been following Sayeeda Warsi's career. </p> <p>From the beginning we felt that Warsi's appointment was tokenistic because the Tory DNA is in essence white, male, Anglo Saxon and Protestant to its core.<br> The signs that she was recruited as part of a 'tick box' form of politics were there from the start. She was a politician who had never won an election, yet she was promoted to the House of Lords and given a Cabinet appointment without humbler Government experience. Mind you, the fact that she was co-chair, rather than completely in charge, should have given her an early indication that her party only half-trusted her to execute the role she had been tasked with. <br>Notwithstanding the crude nature of such gesture politics, her appointment was nonetheless a political master-stroke. Recognising the Conservatives' persistent image as the' nasty party', David Cameron saw her real value as someone who could prop up the image of a modern reformist party comfortable in its multi-cultural skin.<br> <br>The chimaera of an Asian woman influencing the levers of Tory power did prop up this illusion for most of the two-and-a-half years that Warsi was in the Cabinet. She offered the Tory party a plethora of photo opportunities that would have been a PR company's dream: the iconic image of Warsi smiling to camera dressed in a traditional Pakistani salwaar khameez against the backdrop of a predominantly male grey-suited Cabinet. She was the patriotic poster girl for British integration in a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-politics-13244131\">Union Jack-inspired traditional shawl </a>celebrating the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.<br> <br>One could argue that it is unfair to expect Sayeeda Warsi to carry the burden of ethnic representation and she ought to be judged on the merits of her performance in office. That would be true of the other Tory minority ethnic MPs who have wanted to be judged on their own terms rather than as a member of the community.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395720706\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346092185692/David-Cameron-and-George--004.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron and George Osborne\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Did Warsi fit in to the more conventional and male-dominated Conservative party world? Photograph: David Rose /Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rose /Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was clear that as a working class, northern, Muslim woman, Warsi was expected to carry the mantle of race and faith when she was brought into office as the shadow minister of community cohesion and she carried off this role with considerable panache. In many of her party's pronouncements on issues affecting minority communities she was working alongside the Prime Minister helping him negotiate the fractious politics of ethnicity and religion.<br> It is widely known that Warsi was the co-architect of the PM's <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/pms-speech-at-munich-security-conference/\">controversial speech </a>on multiculturalism and British Islam at the Munich Security Conference in February 2011, in which Cameron called on Muslims to embrace British values. Throughout her political tenure she has been key to helping the party formulate its policy on terrorism and extremism.<br> Yet when it has come to asserting minority rights she has essentially remained silent on the issue. It was on her watch that the Equality Act has been eroded and the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/\">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a>'s role as the government watchdog for protected groups made impotent when their funding was halved. For a minister who came from a immigrant Pakistani family in Dewsbury, she has stood too much aside while the government has imposed measures such as increasing the income threshold for those wanting to sponsor a non-EU spouse or partner.<br> In the end, despite Warsi's attempts to follow Conservative policies loyally and make a political career for herself, she came up against the party line. In one of the very few interventions she made on behalf of the Muslim community - when she gave a speech condemning Islamophobia and declared that prejudice against Muslims had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jan/20/lady-warsi-islamophobia-muslims-prejudice\">\"passed the dinner table test\"</a> - her party seemed to turn on her. </p> <p>She was investigated, earlier this year, for breaking ministerial rules in what to many seemed a contrast to the treatment of Jeremy Hunt over his handling of Rupert Murdoch's bid to control BSkyB. <br> In making the decision to replace Warsi it weems clear that the PM has ignored her plea to retain her in the cabinet post because \"I'm a woman, I'm not white, I'm from an urban area, I'm from the north, I'm working class \u2013 I kind of fit the bill.\" The tragedy is that despite the changing demographic profile of the UK, Warsi does not fit the cabinet demographic bill that has dominated UK politics for so long. In demoting her to a newly created post as senior minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs and then allowing her to attend Cabinet meetings, the Prime Minister is engaging in more and worse tokenism. Warsi should retain her self-respect by leaving the Conservative party and exposing the sham that underlies mainstream politics today. </p> <p><em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/RatnaLachman\"> Ratna Lachman</a> is Director of <a href=\"http://www.justwestyorkshire.info/\">JUST West Yorkshire</a></em></p>",
  "<p>A Chinese police chief will go on trial accused of bribery, defection and abuse of power, including allegedly covering up a murder by the wife of his boss, Bo Xilai, state media have announced.</p> <p>The charges against Wang Lijun are a further blow to Bo, the ousted party secretary of south-western Chongqing, whose wife, Gu Kailai, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/gu-kailai-suspended-death-sentence\" title=\"\">convicted last month</a> of killing the British businessman Neil Heywood. Indicting the politician's former ally not just for his flight to a US consulate but for offences related to his duties as deputy mayor and police chief raises obvious questions about Bo's own behaviour, analysts said.</p> <p>Bo, once tipped for promotion in this autumn's once-a-decade party congress, has not been seen since March when officials announced he was under investigation for unspecified disciplinary offences, and the statement on Wang did not mention him. Many experts on Chinese politics believe the party would rather use internal mechanisms to deal with Bo to avoid further embarrassment, but the odds of the politician being tried in court appear to have shortened given the nature of the charges laid against his subordinate.</p> <p>Wang, who spearheaded Bo's populist crackdown on organised crime, set off the storm that toppled Bo when he fled to the US consulate in Chengdu in February, telling diplomats there that he believed Gu had murdered Heywood. Gu received a suspended death sentence, which will be commuted to life imprisonment if she commits no further crimes in the next two years in jail.</p> <p>The state news agency Xinhua reported that prosecutors had charged Wang with \"bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking\", and had said the evidence was \"concrete and abundant\". \"Although [he] had known beforehand that Bogu Kailai was under serious suspicion of murdering Neil Heywood, he consciously neglected his duty and bent the law for personal gain so that Bogu Kailai would not be held legally responsible. Wang was indicted for the crime of bending the law for personal gain,\" the prosecutors reportedly said.</p> <p>Xinhua said the prosecutors alleged that Wang had accepted \"massive bribes\" and had \"illegally used technical reconnaissance measures, either without the approval of authorities or by forging approval documents\". The latter charge is particularly intriguing given claims that Chongqing officials wiretapped the calls of senior leaders visiting the city, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/26/bo-xilai-wiretap-hu-jintao-claims\" title=\"\">a call made to the president</a>.</p> <p>\"This is very bad news for Bo Xilai,\" said Cheng Li, an expert on elite politics at the Brookings Institute. \"Despite the fact that Gu's case has been closed they can still try other people in relation to that.\"</p> <p>Steve Tsang, of Nottingham University, said: \"Clearly it is aimed at Bo. If all they wanted was to hush it up and not do much, they would make it a matter of defection and not raise these other issues. Wang couldn't have done all those things without his boss knowing \u2013 that's blatantly obvious.\"</p> <p>Wang will be tried by the Chengdu intermediate people's court, Xinhua reported. No date was given and it did not say when he was indicted. In theory, courts should reach a verdict on a case within a month of charges being laid.</p> <p>Experts said various exemptions meant trials could take longer, but predicted that authorities would want the case concluded before the party congress in Beijing, expected in mid-October.</p> <p>Tsang suggested that the charges against Wang, given their implications for Bo's case, were a sign that the president, Hu Jintao, was fighting back before the congress. At the weekend his close ally Ling Jihua moved posts, reportedly after a fatal crash involving his son. \"We have seen in the last two weeks or so Hu Jintao's people being pushed on to the defensive. It would be surprising if they just took that,\" he said.</p> <p>News of Wang's indictment came a day after Chinese media reported that his former deputy Tang Jianhua had been arrested last month on bribery allegations. Tang was once hailed as a hero for his role in the \"strike black\" campaign against gangs and the officials who shielded them, which won national renown for Bo and Wang, although critics said abuses such as forced confessions were rife in the crackdown.</p>",
  "<p>Don Siegelman, the former governor of Alabama, has a particular reason to be lobbying for Barack Obama's re-election at this week's Democratic national convention.</p> <p>Siegelman is in Charlotte at the pleasure of a federal judge, and is just days away from resuming a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence, following a widely publicised conviction on bribery charges stemming from his time in office more than a decade ago. His goal at the convention is to drum up support for a presidential pardon, which he knows can come only once President Obama is safely back in the White House for a second term.</p> <p>It's not as much of a long shot as it may sound, because Siegelman is no ordinary felon. The magazine of the American Trial Lawyers Association has described him as \"America's No 1 political prisoner\", and his well-connected friends and supporters include more than 100 former state attorneys general and former Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and John Kerry.</p> <p>Siegelman and his supporters believe he was deliberately targeted by Karl Rove's political machine in the George Bush White House, and that the charges against him would never have passed muster if the federal prosecutors, and the judges who heard his case, were not themselves political appointees with very personal reasons to want to destroy his career.</p> <p>\"Rove came after me because he wanted me out of the way,\" Siegelman said in an interview from his family home in Birmingham. \"I had been a successful Democrat in a Republican state \u2026 I was a Democrat they could not beat fair and square.\"</p> <p>While he was still in office, he was investigated by Alabama's attorney general, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Pryor,_Jr.\">Bill Pryor</a>, who was connected politically and socially with Rove. The investigation \u2013 which resulted in no charges \u2013 was used against him in his 2002 bid for re-election, which became nail-bitingly close. Siegelman lost that race after 7,000 votes were unexpectedly switched in the dead of night in a rural county controlled by the Republicans, and Pryor refused to permit a hand recount to counter widespread suspicions of vote-tampering.</p> <p>Days after the election, the son of Siegelman's Republican challenger was overheard on a conference call describing Siegelman as a cockroach who would \"never die\". According to a Republican operative who later turned whistleblower, Bill Canary, the campaign manager for the new governor and another figure close to Rove, promised that his wife, Leura Canary, recently named a federal prosecutor, would take care of the problem. (Bill Canary<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-3859830.html?pageNum=2&amp;tag=contentMain;contentBody\"> denied this at the time</a> and said he never sought to influence public officials. Rove has <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2008/05/siegelman-scandal-rove-offers-very-suspicious-non-denial-denial\">not denied contacts with the Justice Department over the Siegleman case</a>.)</p> <p>Leura Canary mounted an initial trial against Siegelman in 2004, on charges relating to alleged Medicaid fraud. That collapsed within a day and the outraged judge <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-10-05-ala-governor_x.htm\">dismissed the case \"with prejudice\"</a>, meaning that similar charges could not be brought again.</p> <p>But Leura Canary kept digging, and brought new charges on the eve of the 2006 governor's race, this time accusing Siegelman of extracting a campaign contribution from a healthcare company executive in exchange for a promise to appoint him to a state hospital oversight board. The charge hinged on a fuzzy area of federal law, because such arrangements are deemed illegal only if they hinge on an explicit <em>quid pro quo</em>, something that is almost impossible to prove. Under the American system, campaign donors win government appointments all the time and it is considered business as usual.</p> <p>One snag in the Siegelman prosecution was that the bribery allegation fell outside the statute of limitations, because the alleged offense had taken place more than five years earlier. Canary got around that by filing additional federal racketeering charges, on which the statute of limitations runs to 10 years. The racketeering part of the indictment was subsequently thrown out, but it served its purpose because the rest of the indictment was allowed to move to trial.</p> <p>The presiding judge, Mark Fuller, a Bush appointee, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-fiderer/nothing-about-the-prosecu_b_148483.html\">made a series of rulings against Siegelman</a>. He would not allow Siegelman to introduce evidence of possible political conflicts of interest, and instructed the jury that proof of an explicit <em>quid pro quo</em> was not necessary to find Siegelman guilty. </p> <p>By the time Siegelman's case was appealed, Bush had promoted <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Pryor,_Jr.\">Bill Pryor</a>, the former state attorney general, to a judgeship on the 11th circuit, in a recess appointment that bypassed the objections of Senate Democrats. Two of the seven charges on which Siegelman was convicted were eventually quashed, and he was deemed eligible for a resentencing hearing \u2013 by Judge Fuller, who cut the original punishment by just 10 months. He has served nine months in federal prison to date, with another 69 months to go.</p> <p>Siegelman is arguably the most clamorous victim of the Bush administration's unprecedented efforts to politicise the justice department and apply political pressure on US attorneys around the country to pursue politically motivated prosecutions.</p> <p>And his was undoubtedly the most spectacular political fall. He was once touted as a possible presidential candidate and might have run in 2004 \u2013 if he had overcome his re-election battle in Alabama two years earlier. Like his contemporary Bill Clinton, he was a fast-rising star from the deep south, and a lawyer educated at Georgetown University and at Oxford.</p> <p>Now he is fighting to restore what is left of his reputation, and to campaign for judicial reform to make it impossible to launch political witchhunts like the one he believes targeted him. The man coordinating his pardon campaign is Greg Craig, who defended Bill Clinton against impeachment in 1998 and was President Obama's first White House counsel.</p> <p>In Charlotte he faces a delicate task \u2013 lobbying for support without becoming a distraction, or a possible target for Republican operatives looking for dirt to tarnish Obama's re-election bid. </p> <p>\"I'm going to be speaking to friends of mine \u2013 members of Congress, secretaries of state, attorneys general, lieutenant governors and governors, all of whom have been very supportive,\" Siegelman said. \"But I'm not going to pester these people. The focus of the convention is getting Barack Obama re-elected.\"</p> <p>Next week \u2013 on the portentous date of September 11 \u2013 Siegelman will report to the federal penitentiary in Oakdale, Louisiana. It is, he says, an 18-hour round trip from his family's home \u2013 the furthest point the authorities could have chosen within their judicial district. He plans to use his time behind bars not only to campaign for himself, but to publicizise the iniquities of the American system that the public, in his opinion, only dimly appreciates.</p> <p>\"People don't want to believe that the US government would use torture as a means of interrogation,\" he said. \"They don't want to believe the government would use illegal wiretaps, or that we would be led into war under false pretenses. They don't want to believe elections in the United States are stolen, or that people can manipulate the department of justice and use it as a weapon in politics. But all those things happen.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 September 2012, because the original incorrectly suggested that Don Siegelman was a Rhodes scholar.</p>",
  "<p>Tom Cruise's lawyer has <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-cruise-lawyer-bert-fields-vanity-fair-367889\" title=\"\">denied claims</a> that Scientologist leaders held auditions to find the Top Gun star a new partner in the wake of his split from Nicole Kidman in 2001.</p> <p>Bert Fields spoke out after the US magazine Vanity Fair published an article alleging that Iranian-born British actor Nazanin Boniadi was recruited by Scientology leader David Miscavige's wife Shelly to date the Oscar-nominated actor in 2004 following an exhaustive month-long process. The piece suggests Boniadi was later punished for revealing the relationship to a third party. <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2012/09/tom-cruise-scientology-marriage-katie-holmes\" title=\"\">The magazine does not quote the actor but cites a \"knowledgable source\"</a>.</p> <p>In a statement, Fields wrote: \"Vanity Fair's story is essentially a rehash of tired old lies previously run in the supermarket tabloids, quoting the same bogus 'sources'. It's long, boring and false.\"</p> <p>Scientology officials have also denied the allegations. \"The Church does not punish people, especially in [that] manner,\" a spokesperson told Vanity Fair.</p> <p>Paul Haggis, the Oscar-winning, ex-Scientologist screenwriter and director who is now one of the organisation's fiercest critics, has said he <a href=\"http://www.showbiz411.com/2012/09/02/oscar-winner-paul-haggis-on-tom-cruise-scientology-girlfriend\" title=\"\">heard first hand from Boniadi about her experience</a>.</p> <p>According to Vanity Fair, Boniadi was told she was auditioning for a Scientology training film, and was questioned on her opinions on Cruise during the process. Ex-Scientologist Marc Headley told the magazine he watched a number of the Tehran-born actor's audition videotapes when he was head of the organisation's in-house studio.</p> <p>Boniadi's PR representative declined to comment.</p> <p>Cruise's private life and spiritual leanings have been in the spotlight more than usual following the breakup of his third marriage to fellow US actor Katie Holmes in July. Fields has threatened to sue US celebrity gossip magazines such as the National Enquirer over unfavourable coverage in the wake of the couple's swift divorce and settlement.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's acceptance address to the Democratic national convention on Thursday night, designed to kickstart his bid for a second term in the White House, has been moved indoors from a football stadium, ostensibly over fears that thunderstorms and heavy rain would drown out his oratory.</p> <p>The speech and rally \u2014 the highlight of this week's events in Charlotte \u2014 was meant to take place at the 73,000-seater Bank of America stadium, home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers. Although there were storms and torrential rain on the first two days of the convention, Democratic officials had insisted the event would go ahead as planned, \"rain or shine\".</p> <p>But on Wednesday they announced that it would now be held at the nearby Time Warner Cable arena, which has a capacity of just 20,000, causing a logistical nightmare for Democratic organisers and handing Republican critics with a ready-made attack. Conservatives have been sniping all week that Obama would be unable to fill the 73,000 seats in the stadium \u2013 a claim that the Obama campaign has consistently denied.</p> <p>In a statement, Steve Kerrigan, chief executive of the DNC organising commitee, said: \"The energy and enthusiasm for our convention in Charlotte has been overwhelming, and we share the disappointment of over 65,000 people who signed up for community credentials to be there with the president in person.</p> <p>\"We encourage our community credential holders and Americans across the country to continue to come together with their friends and neighbors to watch and participate in history. The president will speak to these credential holders on a national conference call tomorrow afternoon, and we will work with the campaign to ensure that those unable to attend tomorrow's event will be invited to see the president between now and election day.\"</p> <p>Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican national committee, questioned the claim that the weather was behind the decision. \"After promising to speak at Bank of America stadium rain or shine, Team Obama is moving inside. Troubles filling the seats?\"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reince/statuses/243356284332699650\"> he wrote on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Meteorologists were also sceptical, pointing out the chance of thunderstorms on Thursday evening was relatively low and not unusual for the region.</p> <p>Obama arrives in Charlotte on Wednesday before a keynote speech by Bill Clinton, a man with whom the president has had strained relations in the past but to whom Obama now looks for vital sustenance.</p> <p>Clinton will take the stage amid Democrats' hopes that some of his enduring popularity and the glow of economic prosperity over which he presided will rub off on his successor as Obama fights to stay in the Oval Office.</p> <p>He will make his seventh consecutive address to the DNC, sealing his standing as the pre-eminent Democratic politician of modern times. Clinton has been asked by Obama to place his name in nomination \u2013 the first former president to have the honour.</p> <p>Much will be riding on the occasion. Obama, weighed down by a flat-lining economy and a personal favourability rating that in the latest <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/uploads/1127a40FavorabilityNo40.pdf\">ABC News/Washington Post poll </a> is the lowest of any incumbent since the 1980s, needs a boost from some of Clinton's enviably high approval rating of 66%.</p> <p>Clinton's overall record of balanced budgets and relative economic well-being while in office \u2013 not to mention his comfortable 1996 re-election with a nine-point lead over Bob Dole \u2013 are seen as valuable weapons in Obama's bid to persuade the American electorate to give him a second chance.</p> <p>Michelle Obama paved the way for Clinton by making an impassioned case for that second chance on the opening night of the convention on Tuesday. In a speech that mentioned Mitt Romney not even once, yet still managed between the lines to portray the Republican challenger as privileged and heartless, the first lady delighted the Democratic crowd.</p> <p>She called herself the \"mom-in-chief\", and her husband a \"man you can trust\". \"He reminds me that we are playing a long game here, and that change is hard, and change is slow and it never happens all at once.\"</p> <p>Speaking at at black caucus meeting on Wednesday, the first lady issued a strong warning about the potentially dangerous impact of cash-rich individuals and groups in dictating the election outcome.</p> <p>Obama told the raucous crowd of a few hundred that there was more at stake in this election than just the candidates. The bigger issue \u2013 one that could determine the shape of American democracy for decades to come \u2013 was the role of the Super Pacs, she said.</p> <p>She said: \"We need to step back and ask ourselves: 'Do we want to give a few individuals a far bigger say in our democracy than anyone else?' Do we want our elections to be about who buys the most ads on TV? Do we want our kids and grandkids to walk away from the action feeling like ordinary hardworking voices can no longer be heard in this country, or are we going to show our kids that here in America we all have an equal voice in the voting booth, and we all have a say in this country's future?\"</p> <p>Conservative Super Pacs have raised much bigger sums than their Democratic equivalents, and threaten to outspend Barack Obama two-to-one in support of Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Other headline speeches on Wednesday include Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard law school professor who is locked in a tough battle to take the Massachusetts senate seat from Republican Scott Brown, and Antonio Villaraigosa, mayor of Los Angeles who is chair of the convention.</p> <p>Bill Clinton's address adds another page to the on-going story of his own extraordinary political career, as well as the at times troubled relationship he has had with Obama. During the 2008 primary race between Obama and Hillary Clinton, Bill attacked Obama's bid for the White House as \"the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen\".</p> <p>The top billing Bill Clinton has been granted this year has also fueled speculation around his own wife. Hillary has indicated that she would not serve in a second Obama administration, prompting rumours that she has her eye on 2016.</p>",
  "<p>This photograph, taken on a bright May&nbsp;afternoon last year, was the catalyst for a project I put together called <a href=\"http://www.tom-archer.com/index\" title=\"\">Nothing New</a>, shot in the suburbs of Sheffield. I have lived in one&nbsp;such suburb, Lodge Moor, for most of my life. It's a nice middle-class place to retire to or have a family in. But apart from that, there's not much going on. At the time, I'd been shooting elsewhere around the city, and it was only when I was wandering home one day, taking a slightly different route, that I got this shot.</p> <p>If I spot something going on, I always take a few photographs, but I'm&nbsp;never comfortable hanging around. In this case, I quickly positioned myself&nbsp;on the edge of the woman's front garden and made three exposures, of which this is the second, catching her perfectly in the centre of the frame. I have no idea why she was pulling the curtains in that way: maybe she was cleaning, concentrating on something else, or watching TV and didn't want glare.</p> <p>When I developed the film, I realised that the hidden narratives of everyday suburbia could be a theme. There is nothing that really stands out in this shot: it's just a subtle view&nbsp;of a solitary woman captured going about her business, but&nbsp;I&nbsp; think it shows that the most menial of domestic sights can be beautiful, funny or&nbsp;baffling.</p> <p>My shots are all candid and unstaged scenes. I never speak to my subjects or ask permission. Occasionally, I get caught or questioned by a nosy person who follows me, wanting to know what I'm up to. Luckily, I've never had any major bother. Once, I was shooting someone's house and a guy stopped to ask what I was doing. I told him I was an architecture student and was interested in the windows. He said, \"All&nbsp;right,\" and just drove off.</p> <p>I try never to leave the house without a camera. Whenever I do, I&nbsp;inevitably come across something that&nbsp;would make a perfect picture. Last&nbsp;week, I saw a man on a horse outside Asda.</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> 1989, Sheffield.</p> <p><strong>Studied:</strong> Sheffield Hallam University.</p> <p><strong>Influences:</strong> \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/11/paul-graham-interview-whitechapel-ohagan\" title=\"\">Paul Graham</a>, <a href=\"http://issuemagazine.com/i8artfeature.html\" title=\"\">Tom Wood</a> and <a href=\"http://www.toymachine.com/ed/\" title=\"\">Ed Templeton</a>.\"</p> <p><strong>High point:</strong> \"Winning the <a href=\"http://www.lfph.org/competitions/student-award/info\" title=\"\">2011 Student Street Photography</a> competition.\"</p> <p><strong>Low point:</strong> \"After graduating, trying to get motivated to make new work.\"</p> <p><strong>Top tip:</strong> \"Don't do a degree in photography unless you are going to work hard, otherwise there is no point.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below)</strong></p> <p>For several decades, protection of whistleblowers has been a core political value for Democrats, at least for progressives. Daniel Ellsberg has long been viewed by liberals as an American hero for his disclosure of the top secret Pentagon Papers. In 2008, candidate Obama <a href=\"http://obama.3cdn.net/0080cc578614b42284_2a0mvyxpz.pdf\">hailed whistleblowing</a> as \"acts of courage and patriotism\", which \"should be encouraged rather than stifled as they have been during the Bush administration\".</p> <p>President Obama, however, has waged the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/11/obama-administration-whistleblowers-paul-harris\">most aggressive and vindictive assault on whistleblowers</a> of any president in American history, as even political magazines generally supportive of him have <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obamas-whistleblowers-stuxnet-leaks-drones\">recognized and condemned</a>. One might think that, as the party's faithful gather to celebrate the greatness of this leader, this fact would be a minor problem, a source of some tension between Obama and his hardest-core supporters, perhaps even some embarrassment. One would be wrong.</p> <p>Far from shying away from this record of persecuting whistleblowers, the Obama campaign is proudly boasting of it. A so-called \"Truth Team\" of the Obama/Biden 2012 campaign <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/truth-team/entry/fact-check-president-obama-has-aggressively-pursued-and-addressed-national\">issued a document</a> responding to allegations that the Obama White House has leaked classified information in order to glorify the president:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395721051\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346853982417/leaks5.png\" alt=\"Obama truth squad leaks\" width=\"460\" height=\"217\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Here is what they said:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395721052\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346853748370/leaks4.png\" alt=\"Obama truth squad leaks\" width=\"460\" height=\"137\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Leave aside that this is a total nonsequitur: the fact that Obama has persecuted whistleblowers hardly negates, or even pertains to, the charge that he has leaked classified information when doing so benefits him politically. Indeed, that's precisely what makes his behavior so pernicious: that his administration exploits secrecy laws to punish those who expose high-level wrongdoing while leaking at will for political gain.</p> <p>More remarkable is that a Democratic presidential candidate is sticking his chest out and proudly touting that he has tried to imprison more whistleblowers <em>on espionage charges</em> than all previous presidents in history <em>combined</em>: more than the secrecy-loving Bush/Cheney White House, more than the paranoid, leak-hating Nixon administration, more than anyone in American history. Just contrast the script Democrats now read from to the one they pretended to believe in, in 2008; from the Obama/Biden campaign's <a href=\"http://obama.3cdn.net/0080cc578614b42284_2a0mvyxpz.pdf\">official Document for Change</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395721053\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346854560201/leaks2.png\" alt=\"2008 obama whistleblowers\" width=\"460\" height=\"74\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This tracks perfectly with what Mother Jones' Adam Serwer <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/09/democrats-retreat-civil-liberties-2012-platform\">adeptly documented Tuesday</a> is the radical transformation in the Democratic party platform from 2008, when they feigned concern with civil liberties, to the 2012 platform, when Obama's record makes it impossible (and politically unhelpful) to pretend any longer. Rather than object to what Obama is doing with the power he has been vested is the exact opposite of what they claimed they believed four years ago, Democratic loyalists <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/02/08/repulsive_progressive_hypocrisy/\">simply shift like the wind</a> as their leader does, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/dispatch-from-charlotte-the-dnc-abandons-war-on-terror-criticism/261958/\">without even seeming to recognize that they are doing so</a>.</p> <p>This is the same mentality that causes Democrats to cheer wildly for their leader the day after <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g-lcy97e1q00-ocw0WVO2B1-J2AQ?docId=CNG.addf2dcbfe9b931ff7fc97a6c01cf101.6d1\">things like this happen</a>, as just did on Sunday:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395721054\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346850638148/yemen.png\" alt=\"yemen drones\" width=\"460\" height=\"170\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There will be no mention of any of that during the Democratic National Convention this week \u2013 unless it is to cheer for it wildly.

Continuous killings of innocent people in multiple Muslim countries. </p> <p>This isn't just what Democrats <em>do</em>. It's what they now boast about, what they campaign on, what they<em> celebrate</em>. That, as much as anything, is the Obama legacy.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: A local TV reporter in Cincinnati, Ben Swann, interviewed President Obama today and -- unlike virtually all national reporters -- decided to challenge him on how it is that he believes he has the right to order even American citizens assassinated without due process, and specifically asked him about the killing of the American teeanger Abdulrahman Awlaki in Yemen. Obama's response, needless to say, was to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/09/obama-wont-talk-about-drones-134493.html\">refuse to answer on the ground</a> that it is all a big secret, but the imperiousness of this refusal can only be appreciated by watching the video:</p> <p>Last year, ABC News' Jake Tapper <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6bgwZGZiIo\">relentlessly asked White House press secretary Jay Carney similar questions</a>, and if you haven't seen that video, it's really worth doing so to see how odious it is for the President to claim this most extremist power -- to order people assassinated in secret -- and then have to account to nobody for it.</p> <p>Recall that \"three dozen\" -- that's \"three dozen\" -- current and former Obama aides <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all\">ran to the New York Times in May</a> to heap praise on Obama's supposedly judicious though resolute use of drones to vanquish America's enemies. Recall, too, that he feels free <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/WN/president-obama-tells-joke-jonas-brothers-draws-criticism/story?id=10548687\">openly to tell jokes about his use of drones</a> to kill people. </p> <p>But the minute he is confronted with real questions, he retreats -- just like he does <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/09/25/secrecy_7/\">when his conduct is challenged in court</a> -- to claiming that it is all just too secret to permit any discussion of it whatsoever. In other words, The Most Transparent Administration Ever argues that which citizens the President chooses to kill and why is too secret to permit you to know anything about it (unless having you know about it can benefit him politically, in which case dozens of his aides will leak it).</p>",
  "<p>There is no \"off switch\" for the internet, says the British inventor of the world wide web \u2013 and that is a good thing, because it could only be undone by governments around the world coordinating to turn it into a centralised system.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/timbernerslee\" title=\"\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, who launched the first web page on Christmas Day 1990, was speaking at the launch of a global league table showing which countries put the web to work best.</p> <p>His \"off switch\" comments came after concerns were expressed last year that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hosni-mubarak\" title=\"\">former Egyptian regime led by Hosni Mubarak </a>had suppressed the use of the web to try to damp down the revolution that eventually overthrew it.</p> <p>Berners-Lee, 57, said: \"The way the internet is designed is very much as a decentralised system. At the moment, because countries connect to each other in lots of different ways, there is no one off switch, there is no central place where you can turn it off.</p> <p>\"In order to be able to turn the whole thing off or really block, suppress one particular idea then the countries and governments would have to get together and agree and co-ordinate and turn it from a decentralised system to being a centralised system.</p> <p>\"And if that does happen it is really important that everybody fights against that sort of direction.\"</p> <p>His comments came on the same day that Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of the collaborative online encyclopaedia Wikipedia, gave evidence to MPs about proposals to monitor and store details about emails and other internet communications.

They're more punk than metal, though, and their name is an acronym for Fuck It, Dog, Life's A Risk. Apparently, that's a catchphrase among skaters around their way in LA. They've named their new EP Don't Try, after east Hollywood poet and notorious drunk <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jan/24/charles-bukowski-howard-sounes\" title=\"\">Charles Bukowski</a>'s epitaph. They <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/aug/24/reading-festival-2012-kicks-off\" title=\"\">went down well at Reading</a> last month, which makes sense because they fit that festival like a glove, although punks don't wear gloves as much as <a href=\"http://cultofmac.cultofmaccom.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/wpid-Photo-04092012-1503.jpg\" title=\"\">metal kids</a>. They have toured with the Hives, another perfect match because this is a further reminder, one of those ones that come along every few years, of the primitive appeal of brute-simple rock'n'roll.</p> <p>\"We just like good songs \u2013 we're pretty garage-rocky, but we also write some pop tunes,\" they say, citing west coast punk, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYhgcH7yrVc\" title=\"\">the Germs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsbvo5GVK10\" title=\"\">Black Flag</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVLpaiH2hbQ\" title=\"\">the Cramps</a> as formative influences, with classic rock \u2013 notably <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNZJLHnsGZc&amp;feature=fvst\" title=\"\">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> \u2013 as more recent discoveries. They predict that in five years' time they will be \"selling out Madison Square Garden for a month straight, and then the Hollywood Bowl\", adding: \"Actually we're going to play them on the same night.\" They are certainly going about accruing a large audience the right way, or at least one of the right ways, with a slew of no-nonsense punk'n'roll pummels. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTL1Z09qTEA\" title=\"\">Cheap Beer</a> opens with a powerful rockabilly rumble of a riff, the best of its kind that we've heard since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jan/27/new-band-devin\" title=\"\">Devin</a>'s You're Mine earlier this year. The vocals are frantic, a sort of angsty, antsy, arsey yelp. The chorus \u2013 \"I. Drink. Cheap. Beer. So. What. Fuck. You.\" \u2013 is surely destined to become the student union singalong of the season. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYbJmQj5VkE\" title=\"\">No Waves</a> is punk-pop a la Ramones that finds frontman Zac Carper moaning about \"feeling like a crackhead\", but actually it's more than attitude-dancing \u2013 it's about his recent stint in rehab. The guitar line is quite Buzzcocks, and suggests there is scope here for a broadening out of their ideas.</p> <p>This is punk at its 1976-77 purest, before any of the weirdness or experimentation started <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylOCIP54PIQ\" title=\"\">filtering through in 1978</a>. And yet that guitar part intrigues, making this more than a mere showcase for airhead energy. No Ass is very early Clash, and the singing \u2013 the whole production, really, and we use that term advisedly \u2013 is well muffled. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqS19lUIjCs\" title=\"\">Black Out Stout</a> is a garageland thrash, so ordinary it makes us wonder why Fidlar might have been singled out as something special above the legions of bands who must surely be doing this sort of thing across Britain and the sentient world as we speak. But even here the track builds in such a way, and the guitar sound/melody has a certain quality, that compels deeper listening \u2013 an odd thing to say, of course, about such superficially thrilling music. The last track on their EP, Got No Money, has a pleasingly insistent momentum, and a superb guitar riff/drums combo. It feels like a motorik Modern Lovers, and feel is everything.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"One of the most exciting bands breaking out of southern California right now\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.purevolume.com/news/FIDLAR-interview-how-i-diy\" title=\"\">Pure Volume</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> They're <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/may/30/hives-howlin-pelle-almqvist-interview\" title=\"\">your new favourite band</a>.

  "<p>Alex Salmond has again attempted to bolster the independence campaign by asking his highly-regarded deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon to direct the Scottish government's referendum strategy.</p> <p>Charged too with overseeing economic policy, Sturgeon will spearhead the Scottish government's preparations for the 2014 referendum, starting on Thursday with a meeting with the UK government Scotland minister David Mundell.</p> <p>Sturgeon's appointment came after the first minister held a snap reshuffle.</p> <p>Forced on Salmond partly by the decision of his senior constitutional affairs minister Bruce Crawford to retire, Sturgeon's new posting is the most significant in a series of recent personnel changes within his government and the Scottish National party as the political pace around the referendum sharply accelerated.</p> <p>Sturgeon, the longest serving Scottish health secretary since devolution and widely tipped as the SNP's most likely successor to Salmond, has successfully piloted through two of the SNP government's most contentious measures, with legislation on alcohol minimum pricing and cabinet approval for a gay marriage bill.</p> <p>A firm proponent of a single \"yes or no\" referendum question on independence, she has been critical of Salmond's behind-the-scenes efforts to find a coalition of civil and business leaders to fight for a second question on increased devolution. That option is now thought to be dead: Salmond is understood to be committed to a single question vote in 2014.</p> <p>Salmond's most influential and experienced special adviser, Kevin Pringle, moved last month from his government post to become the SNP's head of strategic communications; on Sunday, the official Yes Scotland independence campaign unveiled its executive team.</p> <p>Salmond said on Wednesday that a date had been pencilled in within the next few weeks for his meeting with David Cameron to agree the terms of the 2014 referendum and the legislation needed to enact it; Downing Street said dates were under discussion, but none had yet been confirmed. The first minister said he believed a deal would be struck when he meets the prime minister.</p> <p>Crawford had been leading the talks with Mundell on the precise detail of the referendum, which is now widely tipped to see votes for 16- and 17-year-olds; supervision by the Electoral Commission; legal approval by the Westminster government; and a single \"yes or no\" question on independence.</p> <p>Salmond said both he and Cameron were keen for that deal to be struck. \"My understanding [is] he's anxious to have the meeting and I'm anxious to have it,\" he said. \"I think progress has been made. I have never regarded these things as presenting insuperable obstacles and nor have they.\"</p> <p>The reshuffle means that seeing the same sex marriage bill into law despite vigorous opposition from the Catholic church and defending the minimum pricing act against court action by Scotch Whisky Association now fall to new health secretary Alex Neil, the former infrastructure minister who was previously one of Salmond's fiercest internal critics and a former party leadership contender.</p> <p>Aware of the risk that Sturgeon's move would provoke allegations that the NHS was being downgraded by his government, Salmond said Neil was one of his most formidable ministers. \"Alex Neil is a very, very serious political figure and a figure of great substance,\" the first minister said.</p> <p>No other senior cabinet posts have changed, but three other junior ministers have been sacked and replaced by backbench MSPs.</p> <p>Brian Adam is replaced as minister for parliamentary business by Joe Fitzpatrick, MSP for Dundee City West. Stewart Stevenson is replaced as minister for environment and climate change by Paul Wheelhouse, MSP for South Scotland, and one of the party's brightest media performers, Humza Yousaf, the MSP for Glasgow, becomes the new minister for external affairs and international development. Margaret Burgess, MSP for Cunninghame South, is a new minister for housing and welfare.</p> <p>Having formally taken on the role of cabinet secretary for infrastructure, investment and cities, with \"lead responsibility for government strategy and the constitution\", Sturgeon told Holyrood on Wednesday that she was \"extremely excited\" by her new post.</p> <p>\"I look forward to making that positive, that honest, that upbeat case over the next two years and I look forward to winning the independence referendum in 2014,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>They just closed the <a href=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4afwoTMWW1rv6xito1_1280.jpg\">public pools for the season here in New York City</a> and that means two things: </p> <p>1. Summer is officially over<br>2. Playoff baseball is around the corner </p> <p>Now that September is here we are bracing ourselves for a new playoff system, the first major change since the 1995 season brought us the very first wild-card games. Twelve years later, there is an extra place for an additional wild-card team, but, it comes with a catch. In order to earn the right to play a division champion in a more forgiving five-game series, the two wild-card teams will play a single game for all the marbles. That is, unless we have ties, then there may be multiple games for all the marbles, which probably doesn't make much sense. Anyway, the division winners are finally getting something for finishing first, which does make sense, and, we could have a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/story/2012-09-04/MLB-postseason-tiebreaking-scenario/57591386/1\">very interesting first week of October</a> should several teams finish with the same record, (which we have as of Wednesday in the AL) the details of which are <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1293765-2012-mlb-playoff-schedule-proves-once-again-that-bud-selig-is-a-bad-planner\">laid out quite well by the good people over at Bleacher Report.</a> For now however, let's take stock of where we are as we wind down to the last two dozen games or so. </p> <h2>American League</h2> <h2>\"The locks\"</h2> <p><strong>New York Yankees </strong></p> <p>\u2022 76-59<br>\u2022 tied for first place AL East <br>\u2022 part of a three-way tie for a wild-card spot</p> <p>There is a panic in New York as the Yankees' train has stalled just short of the station. Two weeks ago, New York enjoyed a six game lead in the American League East, and the chatter was that unlike the injury-riddled Boston Red Sox, the Yankees were getting it done. Well, now they are not getting it done, having lost of 10 of their previous 14 games, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24494157&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24494157&amp;v=3\">including a Tuesday night loss to the Rays</a> in which their manager, Joe Girardi, was ejected. Amazingly, they have fallen into a first place tie with the Baltimore Orioles, and after all that bravado, at least from local talk radio, there is no room to blame their scoring woes on the injured Mark Teixeira, a banged up Robinson Cano, or the recently retuned Alex Rodriguez, never mind that Nick Swisher has begun his annual disappearing act early this year. No one wants to hear that Tuesday night's lineup contained Jayson Nix, Chris Stewart and Chris Dickerson. Nobody wants to hear about Andy Pettitte's ankle either. </p> <p>Can you imagine, the New York Yankees, cruising all season long, missing out on the playoffs? Well, I can't, and that's because it's not going to happen. So what if these Yankees have the same record as the \"lowly\" Oakland A's. It doesn't matter. The Bronx Bombers, with their aura and mystique, their star power, their captain, big payroll, grand stadium, always poised, always in control, will keep it cool, regroup, win the division and play October baseball, just as they have in 16 of the previous 17 seasons. That's just the way it is. </p> <p><strong>Texas Rangers</strong></p> <p>\u2022 80-55<br>\u2022 AL West leaders, four games up</p> <p>Texas are another team that haven't been able to break away from the pack, but will ultimately wind up waiting for the wild-card teams to settle their business before playing in the ALDS. The Rangers have a little cushion, and it will be enough as the Angels and A's scrap to make the wild-card in what, rather incredibly, has become baseball's toughest division. The Rangers recovered from a 9-14 August<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/aug/06/los-angeles-dodgers-texas-rangers-miami-marlins-tampa-bay-rays\"> that had its share of controversy</a>, and now, with Josh Hamilton back to his dominating self, they're waiting for the Fall to try and win their elusive classic. There are major expectations in Dallas, which are usually reserved for the Cowboys, and pitcher Derek Holland can feel it, telling local Dallas radio that \"We feel like we need to win it all but if we put too much pressure on ourselves then it's going to be a lot harder to win. We just need to let things happen.\"</p> <h2>\"The pack\"</h2> <p><strong>Baltimore Orioles </strong></p> <p>\u2022 76-59<br>\u2022 tied for first place AL East <br>\u2022 part of a three-way tie for a wild-card spot</p> <p>Make no mistake, that the O's are in first place on September 5th is nothing less than the biggest story in baseball. Period. </p> <p>Three-fifths of their rotation played in AAA this season. One of those pitchers was picked up from the Mexican League in March. They are one of the worst defensive teams in baseball. They don't have a natural lead-off hitter and they are 10th in the AL in scoring. Their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/aug/14/houston-astros-san-francisco-giants-washington-nationals-baltimore-orioles-pittsburgh\">negative run differential</a> is well documented. In May they said this Orioles run couldn't last. In June they said it couldn't last. In July they said it couldn't last. In August they said it couldn't last. Now it's September, and they are tied with the New York Yankees for first place in the AL East and are also in control of a wild-card spot. Buck Showalter has done a masterful job of managing what is the team's only real playoff-level strength, their bullpen. They won 13 straight one-run games and their relievers aren't burned out. After taking three of four from the Yankees over the weekend, a series they could have easily swept, they have <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24494155&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24494155&amp;v=3\">crushed the Blue Jays</a> in the first two games of their series up in Toronto, holding them scoreless for 13 consecutive innings. </p> <p>Despite the dramatic change in results, after years of abuse, the crowds haven't come out to see these Birds, drawing roughly 47,000 for a recent four-game series vs. Chicago. The explanation for the lack of attendance, at least according to one fan: \"don't f*$;k with a winning streak.\" Fair enough. </p> <p><strong>Oakland Athletics</strong></p> <p>\u2022 76-59<br>\u2022 second place AL West <br>\u2022 part of a three-way tie for a wild-card spot</p> <p>Naturally, the A's GM Billy Beane is getting a lot of credit for the wild ride his Oakland Athletics are on. Now the plaudits are coming in for Bob Melvin, or as he is sometimes known, BoMel. It may sound more like an <a href=\"http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/19/all_hakeembill_2011_5_13_bk.html\">imaginary Brooklyn area dreamt up by Kings County realtors</a> than the A's manager, but BoMel has his ballclub firing on all cylinders in what has become one of the toughest neighborhoods in baseball. Brandon Inge recently told the <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/athletics/ostler/article/Maybe-A-s-BoMel-should-get-a-Nobel-3835522.php\">San Francisco Chronicle</a> that he likes \"Everything that he does. The way he writes the lineup out, the way he considers your feelings every single day. He considers every guy. He communicates with everyone in here. Everyone knows their role, and I've had managers in the past that weren't very good at communicating.\"</p> <p>We won't ask Brandon to name names, although I am sure we can figure it out, rather, we'll just continue to jock his A's, who are lighting up the game with their unheralded but dominating pitching staff, and an offense that, at least for now, are playing like a powerhouse. We all know that Boston are struggling, but they outscored the Red Sox 33-5 over the weekend in running their recent winning streak to nine games. That's a lot of runs no matter who you are playing, and that's certainly a lot of offense for a team that ranks ninth in runs in the AL in 2012. All that recent scoring over the weekend has been somewhat tempered by the Angels coming into Oakland and taking the first two games of their crucial series. </p> <p>Besides needing a win on Wednesday against the Angels, the A's could also use some fans. Perhaps some of those Oakland residents that are keeping the Occupy movement afloat can give a boost to their sagging attendance by occupying The Coliseum? Just a thought...</p> <p><strong>Tampa Bay Rays </strong></p> <p>\u2022 75-61<br>\u2022 third place AL East, 1.5 games out of first place<br>\u2022 1.5 games out of the wild-card spot</p> <p>In 2012, the theme to the Rays has been, if only they could score, just a little bit, they'd be dominating. Well now, with Evan Longoria's presence doing wonders for the Rays lineup, things are looking up for their offense which, until recently, had been dragging their top pitching staff through the mud. Consider this, with Longoria on the field, <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/TBR/2012-schedule-scores.shtml\">Tampa are 32-18</a>. Without him, they are a .500 team. Pitcher Alex Cobb says that the opposing hurler is forced to focus on Longoria, which opens up the possibility of issuing more mistakes to other less talented members of their lineup - a reasonable theory. No wonder that there is some concern for Longoria's hamstring, the left one, which kept him out for over 80 games. <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/rays/content/longoria-leaves-game-after-7th-inning?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">The Tampa Bay Times </a>said that his removal from a 3-3 game in the seventh inning on Sunday was a precautionary move. If I were a Rays fan, that would make me very, very nervous. On the upside, I'd be happy about the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7335303/matt-moore-tampa-bay-rays-reach-five-year-14-million-deal\">contract Matt Moore just signed </a>that keeps him in a Tampa uniform until 2019. That's the future of course. In the present, Tampa are one of several exceptional American League baseball teams trying to squeeze into a few spots. It's hard to think that a rotation that includes David Price, Moore, James Shields, with a closer that hasn't blown a save at home in 22 tries and has an ERA of 0.71 in Fernando Rodney, wouldn't be in the post-season. Tampa have big games on their schedule over the next two weeks - they have beat the sliding Yankees twice in a row, looking very, very good doing it, and after the series finale on Wednesday, they they host the Rangers before travelling to Baltimore and New York. </p> <p><strong>Los Angeles Angels </strong></p> <p>\u2022 73-63<br>\u2022 third place AL East, 7.5 games out of first place<br>\u2022 3.5 games out of a wild-card spot</p> <p>The Angels didn't spend this kind of money to get to a one-game playoff for the right to play in the ALDS, but unless the Halos go on a Rays like run while the Rangers blow up as Boston did a year ago, that's what they're looking at...if they're lucky. The talent is there, obviously, but it's been on again, off again, despite having a roster chock full of Orange County All-Stars. Mike Trout, who was awarded <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/2012/09/04/4786208/angels-trout-again-named-al-rookie.html\">Rookie of the Month</a> for a fourth time on Tuesday (the most since Ichiro earned the honor five times in 2001), is the story of the season but there won't be a postscript if the Angels don't awake from a two month slumber in which they have been nothing more than a .500 team. Basically, it comes down to pitching. In the first half, Los Angeles had a staff ERA of 3.61, good enough for second in the AL. Since the break only Cleveland and Boston have been worse, that despite <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/31/los-angeles-angels-dodgers-cincinnati-reds-boston-red-sox\">acquiring Zack Greinke</a>, who has gone 3-2 with an ERA approaching 5.00. Over the years there have been plenty of talented teams left on the sidelines in October. The 2012 Angels may be joining them. </p> <p><strong>Chicago White Sox</strong> </p> <p>\u2022 73-62<br>\u2022 AL Central leaders, up by one game</p> <p>The Chicago White Sox have spent 105 days in first place, a lot for a club expected to do nothing in 2012. They haven't had a lead larger than 3.5 games since May, hearing Tiger feet every step of the way. Despite playing under pressure all season long, knowing that a heavily hyped Detroit team is breathing on their neck, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/aug/28/chicago-white-sox-boston-red-sox-los-angeles-dodgers\">Robin Ventura's Sox have nothing but steady.</a> His Chisox are a well rounded team that have proven themselves capable, especially the 23-year-old Chris Sale, who is in the mix as a potential Cy Young Award winner. They have a lot of pieces in place that were not supposed to be in place, and when you look up and down their roster you think, yeah, why not? Many see the White Sox success as more to do with the Tigers' failure to take over a division they were awarded in March. While there may be some truth to that, really, that's not fair to these Southsiders who are a big part of what has made 2012 an MLB season of surprises. </p> <p><strong>Detroit Tigers</strong></p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;72-63<br>\u2022 second place AL Central, one game out of first place<br>\u2022&#xa0;four games out of a wild-card spot</p> <p>There are a lot of the Angels in these Detroit Tigers. They look great one day, then, as they did Tuesday, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24500107&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24500107&amp;v=3\">drop a big game</a> to a Cleveland Indians team that couldn't hit water if they all fell out of a boat, missing out on a chance to jump into a first-place tie with the White Sox who lost in Minnesota. There were boos in the Motor City after Chris Perez retired Delmon Young to seal the Tribe's second straight win over the Tigers, and rightly so. They are a talented team that has failed to go on a run that the baseball world has been waiting for. Now it's September, and you have to wonder if it is ever going to happen. Yes, they have been better in the second half, but, thus far, it hasn't been enough. Frustrating is the only word to describe a team that has players such as Miguel Cabrera, Prince Fielder, Justin Verlander, and a Max Scherzer who has caught fire. You wouldn't want to face them in a one-game playoff, especially with one of those two pitchers on the hill, that is, if they can bust out and make the post-season. </p> <h2>National League</h2> <h2>\"The locks\"</h2> <p><strong>Cincinnati Reds</strong></p> <p>\u2022 83-54<br>\u2022 first place NL Central, 8.5 games up</p> <p>The Reds are good, very good. The question is, are they as good as they look? The Reds have been helped by their schedule during a crucial time in their season. Their best player, Joey Votto, played his last game on July 15th, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/jul/17/mlb-5-things-joey-votto-cincinnati-reds\">undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery</a>. Since then the Reds are <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/2012-schedule-scores.shtml\">34-18</a>, but have feasted on teams such as Milwaukee, Houston, Colorado, the Mets, the Cubs, the Phillies, the Padres - all losing teams. In that stretch, they played just 14 games against teams with an above .500 record and in those games they are 8-6. Now, yes, the Reds suffered a big loss when Votto went down, but regardless, you have to wonder if beating up on bad teams during the dog days of summer has made them seem a bit better than they actually are. They have had tremendous pitching all season long, and the fortune to go with it. When Todd Redmond took to the hill in the second game of a doubleheader on August 18th, he became just the sixth Reds starter to pitch all season long - a remarkable run. They also have Aroldis Chapman, who <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=chapmar01&amp;t=p&amp;year=\">has given up a single run since June 24th</a>. Now that Votto is coming back to take his position at first base, manager Dusty Baker has to decide whether or not to play the current NL Rookie of the Month, Todd Frazier, who more than held his own in Votto's absence, or a somewhat resurgent Scott Rolen at third base. This is what passes for a problem in a season where everything is working out for the Reds.</p> <p><strong>Washington Nationals</strong></p> <p>\u2022 83-52<br>\u2022 first place NL Central, 7.5 games up </p> <p>OK, mark it on your calendar - Stephen Strasburg will make his final start on September 12th. <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/tom_verducci/09/04/stephen-strasburg-shut-down-mike-rizzo/index.html\">It's all anyone will talk about in DC,</a> home to one of the best teams in baseball, a sentence that feels bizarre to write (or type), especially when you consider that the District didn't even have a team until 2005. With seven bad years behind them, 2012, has been nothing less than a breakout season for Washington, featuring great pitching, solid hitting and fielding, a 19-year-old phenom in Bryce Harper and a firm hand guiding the ballclub in Davey Johnson. The result is the <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/3/nationals-assure-winning-season-dc-1st-time-43-yea/\">first winning season in the capital in 43 years.</a> Despite such an accolade, the reality is that they will soon be without their phenom pitcher, Strasburg, who has already eclipsed his career high for innings pitched while recovering from Tommy John surgery. GM Mike Rizzo won't \"risk\" their ace for the long term, despite the Nats being in a position to, as Jake Taylor once said, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMCaHxZuf94\">\"win the whole, fu*#ing, thing\".</a> Thing is, they can probably win the whole, fu*#ing, thing without Strasburg, that's how good this rotation, with Gio Gonzalez, Jordan Zimmermann, Ross Detwiler and even Edwin Jackson, is. Aside from dealing with the publicity surrounding Strasburg, the main goal of the franchise is to get healthy before the playoffs, with Adam LaRoche, who leads the Nats in homers, nursing a sore back, while Jayson Werth is a bit banged up with cramping in his hamstring.</p> <h2>\"The pack\"</h2> <p><strong>Atlanta Braves</strong></p> <p>\u2022 76-60<br>\u2022 second place NL East, 7.5 games back<br>\u2022 hold wild-card spot by two games</p> <p>We all know what happened last season. A year later, can the Braves put their infamous September meltdown in their rear view mirror and qualify for the playoffs in Chipper Jones' final season? If you watched their game Sunday you would think, yes, probably. Facing a sweep to the somewhat resurgent Phillies, and a fourth straight loss that was bringing sweaty upper lips to Braves fans everywhere, Jones hit a ninth inning,<a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24449825&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24449825&amp;v=3\"> game-winning three run home run </a>off of Jonathan Papelbon resulting in a dramatic 8-7 victory. If you watched them on Tuesday, you might be tempted to think, no, they can't. <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24500103&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24500103&amp;v=3\">Atlanta were lifeless in being shut out by Colorado 6-0</a>, mustering up just one extra base hit. It doesn't help that there were just 16,686 fans in attendance to watch one of Chipper's remaining games. Yes, college football is back, meaning the spotlight is off the Braves, at least in Atlanta, during the most crucial part of their season. </p> <p><strong>St. Louis Cardinals</strong></p> <p>\u2022 74-62<br>\u2022 second place NL Central, 8.5 games back<br>\u2022 hold wild-card spot by one game</p> <p>Does anyone really think that the St. Louis Cardinals are not going to the playoffs? They might, but they are fools. The Cardinals are God's team, they are protected by something bigger. Disagree? Didn't you watch the 2011 playoffs? Even with the omnipresent Tony La Russa out of the picture, these Cards are still in control. Further evidence came on Sunday. With the Mets needing a run to tie the game in the ninth inning, Andres Torres hit a lead off double. Carlos Beltran, watching the game on television somewhere under the stands, races into the dugout and tells rookie manager Mike Matheny that Torres missed first base. Matheny asks for the appeal, Jason Motte, the Cards closer, throws over to the bag, and<a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24474533&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24474533&amp;v=3\"> umpire Dave Rackley calls him out. </a>Did Torres miss the base? Of course not. Do successful appeals at first base happen often? No, of course not, but the Cardinals get all the breaks, all the time, and that's not ending anytime soon. Motte went on to save the game for St. Louis, but the news got better from there. Chris Carpenter threw a simulated game, and despite missing the entire season with a nerve issue affecting the right side of his body, may be back just in time for the post-season, that the Cardinals will be playing in no matter what. Write it down. </p> <p><strong>Pittsburgh Pirates</strong></p> <p>\u2022 71-64<br>\u2022 third place NL Central, 11 games back<br>\u2022 2.5 games out of a wild-card spot</p> <p>On July 25th 2011, the Pirates had a share of first place in the NL Central and were in Atlanta playing the Braves. In 19, long innings (is there any other kind of 19 inning game?) the Buccos lost 4-3. After that defeat, the Pirates, in the midst of their best season in many many years, went on to lose 42 of their next 61 games. On August 19th 2012, the Pirates occupied a wild-card post and were in St. Louis playing the Cardinals. In 19, long innings (is there any other kind of 19 inning game?) <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24057357&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24057357&amp;v=3\">the Buccos won 6-3.</a> After that dramatic victory, the Pirates, in the midst of their best season in many, many years, went on to lose 10 out of their next 14 games. </p> <p>Whether or not these Pirates can break out of this vicious cycle brought on by 19-inning baseball games remains to be seen, but despite their abysmal recent run, they're just 2.5 games out of a playoff spot. So, in what has been a season of hope, there is still hope. Even if the Bucs can't make the playoffs and compete what has been one of the great stories of 2012, winning just 12 more games in their final 27 will ensure their first winning season since 1992, and that has to count for something. </p> <p><strong>San Francisco Giants</strong></p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;77-59 <br>\u2022 first place NL West, 4.5 games up</p> <p>The Giants struggled all season long to be consistent as a team. When they were pitching well they weren't hitting well, when they were hitting better they went into a pitching slump. The Giants were sputtering along when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/15/san-francisco-giants-melky-cabrera-suspension\">Melky Cabrera tested positive for steroids and banned for 50 games.</a> As it turns out, this may have been the sort of kick in the butt the Giants needed. A talented, underperforming team came together and started ripping off victories, 13 of them, while losing just six times. How do you explain losing the NL hits and batting average leader and improving? I'm not sure if you can, but there is mojo and energy throughout the Giants and their raucous crowd, and they're on the verge of returning to the playoffs just a few weeks after being written off. Over the past week they are third in runs scored, and despite a clear lack of home run power, the lineup is racking up doubles, and finding a way to score. Buster Posey, Hunter Pence, Brandon Belt and Angel Pagan are carrying this team, while the starting pitching struggles. The 2012 Giants are imperfect, but their now fancy rivals to the south, who they swept before they made those big deals, aren't doing anything to expose their weaknesses. They will host the Dodgers for three huge games starting Friday. </p> <p><strong>Los Angeles Dodgers</strong></p> <p>\u2022 73-64<br>\u2022 first place NL West, 4.5 games back<br>\u2022 1.5 games back of a wild-card spot</p> <p>The Dodgers are 5-6 since they acquired Adrian Gonzalez, Josh Beckett, Nick Punto and Carl Crawford from Boston in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/aug/26/los-angeles-dodgers-boston-red-sox-blockbuster-trade\">mega-deal of the century.</a> Unlike teams that really do need to win now, the Dodgers had multiple goals in bringing in all of that wildly expensive talent. Sure, the playoffs would be nice. However, the new ownership were trying to change the culture around Dodger Stadium, while also trying to gain leverage for their off-season negotiating of a new local television deal. So, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24511173&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24511173&amp;v=3\">11-inning defeats to San Diego</a>, which was their Tuesday night result, are for now, not the end of the world. </p> <p>Despite all of the new players, LA still have <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-jansen-returns-20120904,0,3073436.story?track=rss\">issues at closer</a> and the back of their rotation. It also can't help that A-Gone, despite hitting a three-run homer in his first at-bat in Dodger Blue, hasn't done a whole lot since. Still, this has already been a season of intrigue for a franchise that really is getting back on its feet, and whatever happens, happens. The future won't be as forgiving. </p> <h2>\"Miracle Club\"</h2> <p>The Arizona Diamondbacks, Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers are three teams that fit the bill of the miracle club. There is little to no chance that what needs to happen for these teams to enter into what we are deeming, 'the pack' will actually take place. However, we have to show that we learned our lesson from 2011 and at least say that they are in with a tiny, tiny shout. Now, should the earth move again, we'll have this paragraph to cover our butts with.</p>",

  "<p>Let's face it: summer is over. While you're packing away the barbecue and pool floaties, the croquet set and the lawn chairs there is one consolation: at least there will be something good on TV.</p> <p>Well, there is about to be a <em>lot</em> on TV. After Labor Day the five major US networks (if you count the CW) start rolling out the premieres of their new shows. It's happening even earlier than usual this year since NBC is jumping the gun hoping to capitalize on all those damn promos during the London Olympics earlier in August. (Remember when they thought it was a good idea to break into the Closing Ceremonies with an episode of Animal Practice. Yeah, not cute.) As a result, the CW is holding off their shows until early October and the other three are fighting it out mostly on the week that starts September 23. </p> <p>Here are some of the best and the worst for the new fall season, don't let yourself or your DVR get overwhelmed.</p> <h2>Hits</h2> <p><strong>Nashville (ABC, Wednesday, October 10, 10pm)</strong></p> <p>If you like your dramas big and soapy with plenty of dishy diva antics, then this is going to be your jam. And there's plenty of music, of the country variety. This is like Glee for grown ups! We meet Rayna James (Connie Britton) a flailing country star and Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere) the young Eve Harrington insistent on dethroning her. Some of the nonsense about Rayna's scheming rich father may go nowhere fast, but this is a fun and tawdry hour with some good tunes. </p> <p><strong>Elementary (CBS, Thursday, September 27, 10pm)</strong></p> <p>This is for all you Sherlock fans out there. Jonny Lee Miller takes on the role of a young, quirky crime solver who uses his keen power of observation and the always amazing Lucy Liu is the skeptical task master forced with keeping him on the straight and narrow. No one does a smart procedural like CBS (home of the still amazing The Good Wife) and this should run strong well into syndication.</p> <p><strong>The New Normal and Partners (NBC, Tuesday, September 11, 9.30pm and CBS, Monday, September 24, 8.30pm)</strong></p> <p>These shows sound very similar in that they both focus on gay relationships but they couldn't be more different and that is what makes both of them worth checking out. The New Normal is a quirky single-camera comedy (you know, the ones with no laugh tracks) about a gay couple having a surrogate baby. Partners is more traditional (laugh track, three cameras) about two best friends and business partners, one gay and one straight, and how they make their romantic lives work. Finally there is a gay sitcom for the young, hip crowd and one that's more mainstream. The biggest difference is that Normal creator Ryan Murphy has a hard time sustaining his brilliance (look at what he did to Glee) whereas Partners creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan can keep a comedy going for ages (Will &amp; Grace is still in syndication, people).</p> <p><strong>The Mindy Project (Fox, Tuesday, September 25, 9.30pm)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j0atkuby1SY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j0atkuby1SY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>OK, the pilot for this show (which is currently available for free <a href=\" http://www.hulu.com/watch/394815\">on Hulu</a>) isn't perfect, but at least it's not as bad as the horrible title. We meet Mindy, a somewhat messy OB/GYN in her 30s who is trying to find love despite some obvious character flaws. The set up seems really obvious and we can already tell who her supposed gruff love interest is going to be, but there are some solid jokes. That's the same thing I said about The New Girl last season, and that matured into one of the best comedies on TV, so I'm having some faith in creator and The Office vet Mindy Kaling to hit her stride and deliver a hit.</p> <p><strong>Revolution (NBC, Monday, September 17, at 10pm) </strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JwfCRAtkYEI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JwfCRAtkYEI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There are a few shows this year trying to be the elusive next Lost and this is the one that comes the closest. 15 years after the world mysteriously lost all power, America has scattered into low-fi villages and controlled by regional warlords. The one man who may know how to turn the power back on just got killed and his daughter and brother are on a quest to turn the lights back on. The pilot is a little jaunty (but there is a lot of exposition to put in place) but if this can smooth itself out and develop some great characters (Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito plays another stand out villain) then it might finally capture the sci-fi crown.</p> <h2>Misses:</h2> <p><strong>Chicago Fire (NBC, Wednesday, October 10, at 10pm)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bi3h9z1YUVc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bi3h9z1YUVc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There is nothing new, original, or exciting on this drama about the inner works of, you guessed it, a Chicago fire house. There are plenty of hot shirtless fire fighters though, but if that's really your bag, you're better off staring at one of those beefcake calendars.</p> <p><strong>Last Resort (ABC, Thursday, September 27, at 8pm)</strong></p> <p>This is the big next Lost failure. A nuclear sub disobeys orders to launch its missiles at Pakistan and instead takes over an inhabited island and declares itself a sovereign nation with nuclear capabilities. Yes, we don't understand it either. The one success of this show is it seems to be the only thing that will unite anti-government nuts and conspiracy theorists on both the far left and the far right.<br><strong><br>Malibu Country (ABC, Friday, November 2, at 8.30pm)</strong></p> <p>ABC doubles down on the country music programming, except this one is a total flop. We've already seen Reba McIntyre play a country singer named Reba on television, why do we need to see it again, especially with jokes as groan worthy as these? Watch, this thing will probably turn into the new, unstoppable Two and a Half Men.</p> <p><strong>Guys with Kids (NBC, Tuesday, September 12, at 10pm) </strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JJngo3jHnig?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JJngo3jHnig\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The continued insistence that men can't figure out how to raise children complete baffles me, as does this stale show produced by late night funnyman Jimmy Fallon. Anthony Anderson, Jesse Bradford, and Zach Cregger are all guys who can't change a diaper, which sucks because they have no ladies in their lives. It's like Three Men and Three Babies, but that doesn't mean it's three times as funny.</p> <p><strong>The Mob Doctor (Fox, Monday, September 17, at 9pm) </strong></p> <p>It seems like all TV shows are about doctors, lawyers, cops, or mobsters. That doesn't mean by combining two of those that you can make a better show. A sexy lady doctor (Jordana Spiro) gets involved with the mafia because her family owes them a debt. This sounds more like a Lifetime movie than a series, but here it is. The Mob Doctor. Behold it and despair.</p> <p><em>Brian Moylan writes about television for <a href=\"http://www.hollywood.com/\">Hollywood.com</a></em></p>",
  "<p>\"Everyone knows that writers send kids off to school to have unlikely adventures, and readers live lives of vicarious fun and horror. </p> <p>A teacher at my old school banned 'school stories', though. They were collectively preposterous, he said, because school was predictable, safe and filled to the brim with timetabled tedium. The teacher was cross that writers were pulling off some kind of con-trick, and yearned for a book that showed school as it really was. </p> <p>My own series, Ribblestrop would annoy him even more. It's a three-part orgy of crazed adventure, and as there's no timetable to get in the way, the children move at will from roof-construction to weapon-smelting, inventing their syllabus according to what's round them. They live dangerous lives, and as there are no rules they have to invent them. Ribblestrop, Forever! concludes the series and is another romp through the health and safety legislation, ending \u2013 of course \u2013 in triumph and celebration.\"</p> <p>Andy Mulligan was brought up in South London, and educated at Oxford University.

Jennings Goes To School is the first one, and they are pure, comic genius. Buckeridge was the Wodehouse of children's literature, conjuring a world set apart, harmless and joyous. Jennings tries so hard, and constantly comes to grief. His best friend Darbyshire is there to help and advise, but is equally lost. It's a world of stamp collections and fire drills, tuck boxes and Latin tests. It's slapstick, farce, misunderstanding, and it's filled with love. It was my first serious addiction.</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781405224031\">The Malory Towers series by Enid Blyton</a></h2> <p>I love these books for the innocence and simplicity of their non-adventures. The girls play jokes on teachers, enter the occasional talent show or dare to swim in the bay when they shouldn't. The joy comes from the friction of character, as the spoiled snob rubs up against the quick-witted lacrosse champion. Darrell is our guide \u2013 a rather earnest, obedient everygirl who wants to do well but gets distracted. I found them real, because it was about people struggling to get on with each other. There were no monsters or villains, and I had my nose pressed throughout to a world so intriguing.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781853262647\">Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens</a></h2> <p>Some children read Dickens, I'm sure of it. In the first part of this epic, young Nicholas gets a freezing stagecoach to frozen Dotheboys Hall \u2013 he's to be the new teacher. He witnesses the terrible abuses of wicked principals Mr and Mrs Squeers, who flog the boys with terrifying sadism. It's a truly cynical school, based on real places the writer visited, and when Nicholas snatches the cane and thrashes the schoolmaster\u2026oh, the scent of revolution!</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781408810545\">The Harry Potter series by JK Rowling</a></h2> <p>I love Hogwarts because it's a school that lurches from the incredible to the very ordinary, and the children have such human experiences while surrounded by the fantastic. I also love it as Harry's escape from the Dursleys (who I wanted more of, in every book) \u2013 there he was, imprisoned in a family that embodied every Dahl-ian vice, and the doors, and the wall, opened\u2026</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141322766\">Boy by Roald Dahl</a></h2> <p>Most of Dahl's stories carefully avoid school: his heroes go way beyond them. His autobiography, however, lets us glimpse his own school days and the adventures he had. We glimpse the cruelties he endured too, and meet some of the monstrous teachers who must have inspired the repellent, terrifying adults he loved to create.</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571230945\">The Turbulent Term of Tyke Tiler by Gene Kemp</a></h2> <p>Tyke is rebel without meaning to be, and the adventures are witty and captivating. There are twists throughout, but the final one is storytelling genius.</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780747544593\">Holes by Louis Sachar</a></h2> <p>This school for bad boys, with Mr Sir and a psychotic warden, is a true chiller. There's a point when the new arrival is shown the absence of fences and gun-turrets. He's invited to run whenever he wants, because he'll be buzzard food in 24 hours. So begins a complex tale told with economy and enormous affection by a mesmerising writer.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849920001\">Half Brother by Kenneth Oppel</a></h2> <p>This book made me miss a plane, I was so riveted by it. A scientific couple adopt a baby chimp, as an experiment in primate development. Their young son thus has a new brother, and the bonding is real and profound\u2026but fraught with complications. The novel jumps from the boy's life at school, as he tries to negotiate new friendships, to his mesmerising life at the family home \u2013 which has become a school of a very different kind. His true, furry friend is growing strong and unpredictable, and we know the friendship can't last. Don't read it in a waiting room: you'll lose track of time.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141314501\">The Worst Witch by Jill Murphy</a></h2> <p>I love these books and have often read them aloud to enthralled classes of children. Such a light touch, and so inventive \u2013 I think Jill was at the Potter-mine years ago, digging up rich material!</p> <h2>10. Billy Bunter by Charles Hamilton</h2> <p>No list of boarding schools would be complete without him, and Mr Hamilton is another Wodehouse / Buckeridge. An acquired taste, maybe? Is the language getting a little impenetrable, and the customs just too plain foreign? I hope not. The jokes are so good, and the Bunter character so pitiful\u2026</p>",
  "<p>The backlash against \"sock puppetry\" prompted by<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/03/rj-ellory-secret-amazon-reviews\"> RJ Ellory's admission</a> that he had written anonymous book reviews trashing his rivals and praising his own work is now developing its own backlash.</p> <p>In our own Tips, Links and Suggestions, regular commenter <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17940505\">PaulBowes01 declared himself </a> as the author of more than 200 reviews, and said \"I can tell you that most reviews on Amazon and Goodreads are clearly not purchased. The general rule is that the more reviews a book has, the more reliable the overall impression is likely to be as the effect of any dubious reviews is diluted.\"</p> <blockquote> <p>Neither Amazon nor Goodreads have the resources to vet every reader review for integrity. But the idea that most online reviews are deliberately deceptive is a gross exaggeration. It should probably go without saying that the traditional print media also have a vested interest in drawing attention to the supposed shortcomings of their online rivals, and rarely fail to do so.</p> </blockquote> <p>As a group of writers launch a <a href=\"http://nosockpuppets.wordpress.com/\">No Sock Puppets Here Please</a> campaign \u2013 aimed at creating a voluntary code of conduct to stop the practice \u2013 novelist Barry Eisler <a href=\"http://barryeisler.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/and-why-beholdest-thou-mote-in-thy.html\">blogged about his misgivings,</a> even though he had decided to sign up.</p> <p>These ranged from discomfort about the campaign's decision to name and shame offenders, to reservations about the campaign's attempt to co-opt \"readers\" to the clean-up cause.</p> <p>Perhaps most interestingly he questions the implicit idea that all forms of sock puppetry are equally bad: </p> <blockquote> <p>Because I think intent matters, I also have to add my sense that review-buying and self-praising-sock-puppet-deploying authors aren't trying to hurt anyone else. They're only trying to help themselves. Yes, at least arguably, there is a likelihood of harm regardless of intent, but in criminal law intent matters, and for me it matters here, too.</p> <p>This is part of why the use of sock puppets to trash other authors is, for me, another story. I find it disgusting and not just regrettable, but reprehensible. In addition to its inherent, direct likelihood of harm to the authors against whom it's directed, it is intended to cause harm. Harm, not just personal advantage, is its purpose.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the comment thread on Eisler's blog, 1001 Secrets of Successful Writers wrote: \"Writers and publishers have been paying for reviews for decades. It's a well-known practice. Do people really think that giving a free copy away to a reviewer is not a bribe? Sorry, it is. I wonder how many writers on that list have had free copies of their books sent to reviewers or had their publisher pay for reviews \u2026 They should look at themselves before they throw stones at others.\"</p> <p>Do you think 1001 Secrets of Successful Writers is right?

  "<p>John Oaksey, who has died aged 83, was the best amateur steeplechase jockey of his era, a talent that he translated into a hugely successful career as a racing journalist, broadcaster and author. Though he rode big-race winners in Taxidermist, Proud Tarquin and Bullocks Horn, his riding career was best remembered for his partnership with a horse that failed to win. Carrickbeg, his mount in the 1963 Grand National, was caught and beaten in the final strides by the 66-1 shot Ayala.</p> <p>Already he had found a wider role in the sport \u2013 four days before the National he was invited by BBC television to fly round the course in a helicopter, describing the fences, and how it feels to ride in the great race. His description of the closing stages, \"Round the last elbow into the straight&#xa0;\u2026 the final dregs of stamina are draining fast for horse and man alike. A hundred yards to go and perhaps another's head appears at his knee,\" was replicated to the letter by events on the day. Carrickbeg jumped the last fence in front and led the entire 484 yards of the Aintree run-in until the final strides.</p> <p>This preview, and his brilliant immediate account of the race for the early editions of the Sunday Telegraph, sealed Oaksey's future in the media. When a riding accident enforced his retirement from the saddle in 1975, he combined his now prolific journalistic career with work for charitable causes, notably the Injured Jockeys Fund, which, he reflected in 2004, had given him \"more pride than any of the other activities in my racing life\".</p> <p>He was born in London to Marjorie and Geoffrey Lawrence, and his forebears had achieved distinction in the law. As Lord Justice Lawrence, his father presided over the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1946. Two years later he was created Lord Oaksey, and became Lord Trevethin upon the death of his older brother. The titles passed to John on his father's death in 1971.</p> <p>Although his destiny was always envisaged as being within the family profession, his father suggested that, after Eton, he read philosophy, politics and economics rather than law at New College, Oxford. While there, he rode in several point-to-points, winning his first race at the Pegasus Club meeting in 1951.</p> <p>After winning an exchange fellowship to the law school at Yale, he returned to Britain to pass all but the final examination for the bar. But then Bill Curling, the Daily Telegraph racing correspondent, offered him a job as his assistant.</p> <p>The appeal of combining such work with race-riding was irresistible. Oaksey joined the Telegraph and the following year, aged 28, he was given his own column under the pen name of Marlborough.</p> <p>In 1959, he inherited the Audax column in Horse &amp; Hound magazine from the late David Livingstone-Learmonth. It was a weekly duty that he performed with excellence for almost 30 years.</p> <p>His first regular television work was with Pay-TV, the pay-as-you-view experiment set up by the boxing promoter Jarvis Astaire in 1965. It won the contract to show Kempton Park races from BBC television, but collapsed two years later. From 1969 until the end of his broadcasting career in 2002, Oaksey was employed by ITV and Channel 4. His appeal was universal, combining his first-hand experience as a steeplechase jockey with an affable, good-humoured charm.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Oaksey's riding (as Mr J Lawrence) went from strength to strength. In 1958 he won the prestigious Imperial Cup at Sandown on Flaming East, the Whitbread Gold Cup at Sandown on Taxidermist, and the Hennessy Gold Cup at Cheltenham on the same horse, a remarkable treble for an amateur rider.</p> <p>Oaksey's one major race-riding disappointment apart from the Grand National came when Proud Tarquin carried him to a short-head success from The Dikler in the 1974 Whitbread Gold Cup, only to be disqualified for interference. It was widely regarded as a harsh decision, which rankled with Oaksey for the rest of his life. The following year a crashing fall compelled him to end his riding career.</p> <p>Oaksey was one of the original trustees when the Injured Jockeys Fund was launched in 1964, after two successful and popular National Hunt jockeys, Tim Brookshaw and Paddy Farrell, were paralysed in separate falls at Aintree racecourse. By its 40th anniversary, it had helped more than 1,000 jockeys and their dependents. Oaksey was appointed OBE in 1985 for his services to charity, and played a major role in Bric (the British Racing Industry Council), the Stable Lads Association, Racing Welfare and the Moorcroft Racehorse Welfare Centre.</p> <p>His personal affairs were not always as well regulated. In 1959 he married Tory (Victoria) Dennistoun, daughter of a racehorse trainer, with whom he had a son, Patrick, and daughter, Sara, the wife of trainer Mark Bradstock. When the marriage fell apart and Tory left the family home to pursue her career as an artist, Oaksey leant heavily on the hospitality of friends, notably Frank Crocker, a local farmer.</p> <p>In 1987 Oaksey suggested that Crocker, who was selling his farm, and his wife, Chicky (Rachel), should buy an estate-owned cottage at the end of his drive. Within months Chicky had left her husband and two children, and moved into Hill Farm to live with Oaksey, whom she married the following year. The episode provoked tabloid headlines, and many of Crocker's wide circle of friends took a long time to forgive him for what they considered ungentlemanly behaviour.</p> <p>By the time he produced his autobiography in 2003, Oaksey was already suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, he continued to work tirelessly with his wife for the charities he supported, and in 2009 a newly built retirement complex for injured jockeys in Lambourn, Berkshire, was named Oaksey House in his honour. His latter years were also enhanced by the successes of his steeplechaser Carruthers, trained by his son-in-law, including winning the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury last year.</p> <p>Oaksey is survived by Chicky and his children.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>John Geoffrey Tristram Lawrence, 2nd Baron Oaksey, jockey, writer and broadcaster, born 21 March 1929; died 5 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>Toilet paper adverts run pretty much to script: the cute dog; the mellow music; the assuring science bit about double-ply absorbency rates; and no jokes \u2013 toileting is serious business. Andrex has bravely veered off piste. Gone is \"soft, strong and very very long\"; in its place, we get \"Be kind to your behind\". That's funny. Kind of.</p> <p>Now check out its new <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goWvdcoN3qk\" title=\"\">Andrex Eco ad</a>. The puppies are animated, the tone is light-hearted and the eco-message is relatively subtle. The clip isn't advertising gold. It feels a lot like children's TV, and the \"bamboozling\" catchphrase: toilet paper made from bamboo. Get it? Comes across as a tad cheesy.</p> <p>But the sight of Max, Andrex's \"lead puppy\", going green marks a significant shift. At last, advertisers seem to have twigged that lecturing doesn't work.</p> <h2>Leaving out the lectures</h2> <p>We need messages that amuse or inspire us, not messages that make us feel the world is about to end and it's our fault if we don't go out and buy coarse, recycled toilet tissue right now.</p> <p>As a rough rule of thumb, around 10% of consumers will clock into hard-sell environmental advertising. This eco-buying niche is offset by a similar number of staunch naysayers.</p> <p>The huge challenge for sustainability is winning over the bulk in the middle, reckons Mike Barry, head of sustainable business at the UK retailer M&amp;S: \"This group will only change when they see that joining the [eco] 10% is easy, fun and exciting, not difficult, worthy and full of compromises and sacrifices.\"</p> <p>M&amp;S has applied that logic to its own consumer engagement. Its most recent venture is \"<a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/Shwop/b/1672188031\" title=\"\">shwopping</a>\", a hybrid of shopping and swapping. The idea is simple: the high-street retailer wants customers to hand over an old or unwanted garment whenever they buy a new one.</p> <p>The initiative is an extension of the company's longstanding partnership with Oxfam, whereby customers were given M&amp;S vouchers for donating clothes to the anti-poverty charity. Shwopping offers no such incentive. And yet it's clearly tapped into something: more than 500,000 items were donated at M&amp;S's 342 stores during the initiative's first few months.</p> <p>Alan Knight, sustainability director at Business in the Community (BITC), is a fan. The beauty of shwopping lies in it being a \"very simple ask\" for consumers, which \"they get\". Yet at the same time the model is \u2013 potentially \u2013 very radical.</p> <p>\"Imagine if every clothes retailer did what Marks &amp; Spencer is doing: it'd create a completely different supply chain. They're re-engineering the textile business model,\" enthuses Knight.</p> <p>His support is understandable. M&amp;S is party to a new project being run by BITC, based on making sustainability easy, normal and fun. The <a href=\"http://www.startuk.org/\" title=\"\">Start Campaign</a> sees big UK brands demonstrating simple steps towards more sustainable lifestyles.</p> <p>Asda provides a case in point. The UK supermarket chain has set up a <a href=\"http://www.startuk.org/community-life/the-story-of-burnley.aspx\" title=\"\">pop-up farm</a> for primary school pupils near its head office in Burnley. The scheme gives the opportunity for children to plant their own vegetables, see them grow and then eat or sell them.</p> <p>\"It works because it's a long-term conversation \u2026 and it's a more sophisticated narrative than just 'Stop your taps dripping'; it's about your relationship with food and with nature,\" Knight explains.</p> <p>As part of the same campaign, the homeware and DIY store <a href=\"http://www.diy.com/diy/jsp/bq/templates/content_lookup.jsp?content=%2Fcontent%2Fmarketing%2Fone_planet_home%2Fproject_start%2Findex.jsp&amp;menu=eco&amp;noCookies=false\" title=\"\">B&amp;Q is exhibiting a model kitchen</a> at county shows. Visitors are provided with no-nonsense tips on how to cut energy, save water and the like.</p> <h2>Turning point</h2> <p>The attention that businesses are now giving to consumer behaviour marks a turning point for the sustainability debate.</p> <p>Companies, especially those in the consumer-facing sector, realise that snazzy eco-design and operation-related resource efficiencies \u2013 necessary though they are \u2013 can only get them so far.</p> <p>The Anglo-Dutch consumer company Unilever, for instance, estimates that a whopping two-thirds of the greenhouse gas impacts across its product lifecycle relates to consumer use. The figure comes in at around half for its water footprint.</p> <p>\"The biggest impacts are often after sale, whether that's washing clothes or wasting leftover food\", says Richard Hardyment, associate director at the London consultancy <a href=\"http://www.corporate-citizenship.com/\" title=\"\">Corporate Citizenship</a>.</p> <p>\"That means sustainability has to be a normal part of people's everyday lives, not some niche. And making it easy and fun is the most effective way to making that happen\", he adds.</p> <p>The advice chimes with Unilever's own thinking. Late last year, it launched a \"behaviour change\" strategy. <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/news/news/inspiring-sustainable-living.aspx\" title=\"\">Five Levers of Change</a> is based around research into what stops people from changing their habits and, contrariwise, what encourages them to start a new habit \u2013 and then stick to it.</p> <p>The essential messages corroborate what Max, the Andrex puppy, appears to have worked out: lesson 1, make it understood; lesson 2, make it easy.</p> <h2>Bolder brands<br></h2> <p>The theory is there, but practical examples still remain thin on the ground. One early experiment by Unilever came last year with its Turn off the Tap campaign in the US. Suave, Unilever's hair brand, teamed up with the retail giant Walmart to market a water-efficient shower-head. In-store messaging rammed home the cost benefits of water conservation.</p> <p>Cutting short your shower by two-minutes saves $150 on water and energy bills per year, shoppers were told. The campaign nudged them on with a $5 discount coupon.</p> <p>Marketing expert Lucy Shea welcomes such behaviour-change campaigns led by consumer brands, which she describes as \"pro\" not \"anti\" forces. \"Brands are all about consuming and selling and promising and aspiring, so they never make things about sacrifice \u2026 which is where a lot of behaviour change campaigns have gone wrong in the past\", says Shea, chief executive of the sustainability communications firm <a href=\"http://www.futerra.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Futerra</a>.</p> <p>Over and above making sustainability fun or easy, brands are uniquely positioned to infuse sustainable living with an even more potent attribute: desirability. (Lesson 3 of Unilever's Five Levers for Change, as it happens).</p> <p>Shea cites the example of <a href=\"http://swishing.com/\" title=\"\">swishing</a>, an idea dreamt up by Futerra five years ago. Again, its genius lies in its simplicity. Instead of heading off to the shops at the weekend, groups of female friends get together and exchange fashion items among themselves. There are now swishing parties held on every continent.</p> <p>\"It's all about substitution, not sacrifice,\" Shea explains. \"You get to not shop, but you get to go to a swishing party and have a great time rather than chugging up and down the high street.\"</p> <p>However, most brands remain reluctant to use their scale and influence to nudge consumers towards more sustainable lifestyles. <a href=\"http://www.futerra.co.uk/blog/planet-brands-5\" title=\"\">The Planet Brands Index</a>, a recent study of 100 brands, finds only a \"handful that are doing something\", according to Shea.</p> <p>Julia Hailes agrees. Brands need to be more passionate about effecting change, says the author of The Green Consumer Guide, which was first published in 1988. A good example, she suggests, is the campaigning style of The Body Shop in its early days.</p> <p>As she puts it: \"A company that I was recently talking to kept saying 'We want to be humble'. I said: 'Sod being humble. You want to be authoritative and be out there.' So you see, there's a reticence to lead and take up the challenge.\"</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><em>This article forms part of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/series/letstalksustainableliving\">Let's talk sustainable living</a>, a series of thought provoking conversations around the big challenges facing companies in making sustainable living mainstream.

  "<p>\"British business offers its future leaders overseas experience, so why is the British PhD still such a stay-at-home affair?\" This was the question at the heart of T<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/may/15/phds-international-travel-broaden-mind\" title=\"\">anya Filer's blog</a> for the Network earlier this year.</p> <p>In her article, the doctoral researcher argues that time spent in research communities around the world is not only important for the individual (and especially the PhD candidate) but also for the quality of research output at an institution, which in turn has an impact on reputation. She says: \"The PhD candidate, compared to others in the British higher-education landscape, is most at sea in terms of international opportunity \u2026 PhDs are supposed to push boundaries of knowledge, not encourage acquiescence; however free-thinking an institution may be, it is surely harder to think anew when fixed in one place, among one group of people\".</p> <p>And Tanya is not the only espousing the benefits of global exposure.

Understanding their research culture and using their research language has a new priority\".</p> <p>The following year Vitae which champions researcher development, developed the '<a href=\"http://www.vitae.ac.uk/policy-practice/438141-455971/Developing-the-Global-Researcher--what-so-what-and-now-what.html\" title=\"\">global researcher project</a>' with Universities of Manchester, Southampton and Liverpool and at their <a href=\"http://www.vitae.ac.uk/policy-practice/916-494271/Workshops/555441/Vitae-Researcher-Development-International-Conference-2012-Realising-the-Potential-of-Researchers.html#pageInfo\" title=\"\">annual conference</a> which took place at the start of this week, facilitating researcher mobility was covered in a workshop.</p> <p>But as some of the comments on Tanya's blog indicate, there are disparities of opportunity between the humanities and the sciences (one commenter, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/16146798\" title=\"\">ThePaladin</a> writes: \" This is purely a failing of the humanities.

  "<p>Japan has set itself on a possible diplomatic collision course with China after agreeing to buy three islands in the East China Sea that are at the centre of a long-running territorial dispute with Beijing.</p> <p>Japan's media reported that the government would purchase three islands belonging to the Senkaku chain \u2013 known as Diaoyu in China \u2013 from private Japanese owners for 2.05bn yen (US$26m).</p> <p>The reports drew an angry response in China, which called the move illegal and invalid.</p> <p>\"For them to nationalise the Diaoyu islands seriously violates China's sovereignty and hurts the Chinese people's feelings,\" Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing.</p> <p>\"I stress again that any of their unilateral acts with the Diaoyu islands are illegal and invalid. China's determination will not change in terms of safeguarding its territory. China is observing the situation and will take necessary measures to defend its sovereignty.\"</p> <p>The uninhabited islands, which have been administered by Japan since 1895, attracted Chinese interest in the 1970s after studies suggested they could sit amid potentially huge deposits of oil and natural gas. They are also near vital sea lanes and surrounded by rich fishing grounds.</p> <p>The Senkakus are also claimed by Taiwan, but it is the competing assertions of sovereignty by Japan and China that have come to the fore in a summer of territorial tensions in east Asia.</p> <p>China has angered its neighbours, including Taiwan and the Philippines, with aggressive claims to islands in the South China Sea. Japan, meanwhile, has been locked in a separate disagreement with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/south-korea-japan-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">South Korea over a pair of islands</a> located in the Japan Sea, known as the East Sea among Koreans.</p> <p>The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, raised the possibility of bringing the Senkakus under state control after Tokyo's nationalist governor, Shintaro Ishihara, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/tokyo-governor-senkaku-islands-china\" title=\"\">launched a controversial campaign</a> in April to buy them.</p> <p>Reports said the government and the owners are expected to sign a contract by the end of the month, following secret negotiations between a senior member of the family and the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Hiroyuki Nagahama.</p> <p>The government had previously leased three of the five islands comprising the chain.</p> <p>\"We are negotiating with the owner while we try to grasp where the situation stands between [the central government] and the Tokyo metropolitan government,\" said Japan's chief government spokesman, Osamu Fujimura. An announcement would be made \"when we reach a result after completing the process\", he said.</p> <p>The dispute <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/24/japan-free-chinese-boat-captain\" title=\"\">made international headlines in September 2010</a> when a Chinese fishing vessel collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the islands. In an attempt to prevent the row from escalating, Japan released the captain of the fishing boat without charge.</p> <p>Ishihara's bid to bring the islands under the control of the Tokyo metropolitan government attracted more than 1.4bn yen in donations from the public, and threatened to inflict serious damage to Sino-Japanese ties.</p> <p>Despite the nationalisation plan, Noda appears determined to lower tensions by agreeing not to build a jetty or other facilities on the island.</p> <p>Ishihara, by contrast, had hinted he would approve construction of a weather observatory and dock, adding that the Senkakus needed protecting from Chinese aggression.</p> <p>Ishihara, who has earned a reputation as a China-baiter, said the Senkakus' owners had told him no deal had been finalised, while Tokyo officials said the governor was expected to visit the islands in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The most recent tussle ignited nationalist sentiment in both countries. Japan detained a group of Hong Kong-based activists after they landed on one of the islands last month, and there were protests in several Chinese cities after a group of Japanese nationalists did the same several days later.</p>",

He also started a fire on the premises. A spokesman for the force added that another man was being treated in hospital for \"nervous shock\". </p> <p>As he was detained, the gunman, wearing a balaclava and a bathrobe, allegedly repeated twice in French with an English accent: \"The Anglophones are waking up,\" an apparent reference to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/02/quebec-student-protest-canada\">\"maple spring\" of student protests against the government</a> that contributed to the snap election being called.</p> <p>Marois came back on stage to give a final thank-you to her supporters before urging them to calmly evacuate the concert hall.</p> <p>In a statement issued early on Wednesday, Marois said her thoughts were with the family of the victim. \"Following this tragedy all Quebecois are mourning today before such a gratuitous act of violence,\" she said. \"Never will a society such as ours let violence dictate its collective choices.\"</p> <p>The Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, said in a statement that he was \"angered and saddened\" by the shooting. \"It is a tragic day where an exercise of democracy is met with an act of violence,\" Harper said. \"This atrocious act will not be tolerated and such violence has no place in Canada.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395693173\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346815729601/Supporters-of-Pauline-Mar-008.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Pauline Marois and the Parti Quebecois cheer the party's victory in Quebec's elections\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Pauline Marois and the Parti Quebecois cheer the party's victory in Quebec's elections.

For the first time the government of Quebec will be led by a woman.\" She promised to govern responsibly in the public interest, putting Quebec's divisions aside in favour of common loyalty to the province.</p> <p>The PQ is likely to form a minority government after winning fewer seats than required to take power outright, and the result leaves questions over whether it will be able to hold a referendum on leaving the Canadian federation.</p> <p>The snap election was called after a student strike over raising tuition fees and the Liberal government's crackdown on student protesters caused unrest across the province.</p> <p>Former student strike leader Leo Bureau-Blouin, 20, was elected in his district of Laval for the PQ, making him the youngest elected to the national assembly.</p> <p>Jean Charest, the leader of the federalist Liberal party, which has governed Quebec for the past nine years, was unseated in his own district of Sherbrook, while his party came in second behind the Parti Quebecois. </p> <p>Support for the party leader has waned due to his handling of the student strike, allegations of corruption in the construction industry and passage of Bill 78 \u2013 a widely condemned anti-protest law that brought hundreds of thousands of Quebecois on to the streets during the spring.</p> <p>Marois has promised a tuition freeze until a summit on higher education financing is held, has pledged to repeal Bill 78, and would like to pass a third referendum on Quebec sovereignty. </p> <p>Quebec separating from Canada is a bitterly contentious issue between in the French-speaking province and the election of the PQ only to minority government may indicate Quebec people are not ready to face a third referendum, the previous two having been defeated.</p> <p>Marois proposes to expand Quebec's language Law 101 preventing francophones and immigrants from attending English junior colleges and has proposed a law that would prevent non-French speakers from running for office.</p> <p>More controversially, she proposed a secularism charter banning public service employees from wearing overt religious symbols, like the Jewish yarmulke and the Muslim hijab. </p> <p>Shadak Islam, a digital technician who moved to Quebec from Bangladesh with his wife eight years ago, said it was the PQ's policy on religion that made him vote Liberal. \"The headscarf is not a symbol, it's a duty to my religion,\" he said. </p> <p>Fear of a referendum could explain why anglophones and immigrants in the province opted for Charest's Liberal party or voted for the upstart Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ), the nine-month-old party of former PQ cabinet minister, Francois Legault, who came in third with 19 seats. Legault proposes strengthening the laws that protect the French language, supports a more moderate student tuition rise while promising a decade-long moratorium on any sovereignty referendum.</p> <p>In fourth place, the two co-leaders of progressive left party Quebec Solidaire, Amir Khadir and Francoise David, were elected in two Montreal districts. The two leaders of the pro-sovereignty party have been in the streets supporting the student strike from the beginning, propose to abolish higher education tuition fees and have a green, pro-feminist, pro-minority platform.</p> <p>Francoise David, who gained a high profile for having won the campaign debates, said her party would support Marois's PQ on a case-by-case basis, but their two seats won't swing the balance of power to form a pro-sovereignty majority government.</p> <p>Charest, the ousted Liberal premier, told supporters he accepted responsibility for the defeat.

  "<h2>Lauren Gee, project co-ordinator for sustainable environments at the <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Housing Federation</a></h2> <p>Before becoming a housing professional, I went to university and studied for a law degree. In my final year I decided I wanted to work in housing. Although I had my degree when I started applying for jobs, it wasn't an essential requirement, and I didn't use it that much in my entry level position as a team assistant. When I became a neighbourhood manager, my knowledge of the law came in handy and I started studying the Chartered Institute of Housing's (CIH) distance-learning, postgraduate professional qualification but, equally, my experience of working in a housing association came in very useful \u2013 and a large proportion of my team had no housing qualifications or degree and were still very good at what they did.</p> <p>I'd say housing is one of those jobs where you ideally need a good blend of experience and knowledge \u2013 too much theory and you end up missing out on the essential \"people\" element of the work, and perhaps lose sight of what we are working towards. Too much work without the underpinning knowledge and you may end up making things worse if you aren't aware of the legalities and requirements behind decisions and processes.</p> <p>So perhaps an entry-level position, and undertaking a housing course on day release, is the best option. Alternatively, an apprenticeship which I believe some housing associations are now beginning to offer? I certainly wouldn't say a degree is necessary, but it helps.</p> <h2>Dr Alina Congreve, principal lecturer in sustainable planning at the <a href=\"http://www.herts.ac.uk/home-page.cfm\" title=\"\">University of Hertfordshire</a></h2> <p>If you are thinking of going to university, do lots of background research. Prepare a list of questions and take them to university open days. Talk to current students while you are there \u2013 as well as the staff. Do ask about what you will be getting for your time and investment, how many students will be in your classes and how many teaching hours will you get each week? Find out what links they have with the housing sector and if there are opportunities for placements. Are recent graduates managing to secure housing jobs?</p> <h2>Rosemary Perrett, regeneration manager at <a href=\"http://www.brent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Brent council</a></h2> <p>There are many different careers in housing, which each require many different skills sets, experience and training. It is this variety of work which has held me interested in housing for more than 30 years. Since my first day in the family housing association office, I have never wanted to consider any other type of work.</p> <p>If I was advising a teenager today, I would recommend them to try to get on to a degree level housing course which included spells of working in housing organisations, and to make sure that their degree course could lead on to membership of the CIH or Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) or similar, depending on their interests and aptitudes. For years now, the majority of housing jobs seem to have required degree level qualifications (but not necessarily a housing degree) and some insist on you completing the CIH or RICS qualification.</p> <p>If you are not able to access or sustain a degree level course \u2013 and I know that it is increasingly difficult for people to afford three or four years of higher education \u2013 then I would recommend that you look for an employer who would allow you to continue your education with a view to eventually achieving these qualifications, if you want the full range of housing work to be available to you in the future.</p> <h2>Jacqueline O'Mahony, housing environmental health officer working for a local authority</h2> <p>If you would like a career that is varied; dealing with all sorts of people, from all walks of life, many of whom can be extremely challenging; making the link between the conditions in a person's home and their general and mental health; paying attention to detail and applying the legal system to give advice and education to both landlords and tenants; trying to protect tenants from harassment and illegal eviction; a job that can make a difference to peoples' lives (although you may not always get thanked for it) because you are mostly dealing with the most vulnerable in our communities ... then I would recommend a career in environmental health, and specialise in housing.</p> <p>I retrained as an environmental health officer nearly eight years ago from another career. The job can be frustrating as well as satisfying, but never boring. Look up the <a href=\"http://www.cieh.org/\" title=\"\">Chartered Institute of Environmental Health</a> website for details. It has case examples to give you an idea of the range of work you can undertake on qualification. This need not be in a local authority, but across many parts of the private sector as well.</p> <h2>Aileen Evans, managing director of <a href=\"http://www.aragon-housing.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Aragon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.macintyreha.co.uk/\" title=\"\">MacIntyre</a> housing associations</h2> <p>I think whether somebody wants to go to university is a personal thing but, if I were recruiting for a post, then whether candidates had a degree would not be uppermost in my consideration.</p> <p>I certainly would not look for a degree in housing. For instance, we have people working here who have degrees in biochemistry, German, modern languages, history, music (me), English and geography.</p> <p>There are many routes into housing but we recruit for attitude, not for skill \u2013 we can teach people how to do things, but working in housing is all about people, and in particular how to work with people in sometimes very difficult circumstances. We look for team players who are prepared to work hard. We look for people with great communication skills and for those who are honest and open in their approach. We also look for those who are problem solvers, who can demonstrate flexibility and a degree of tenacity.</p> <p>There are posts clearly where some degree of experience is required: we'd be unlikely to recruit a finance director who wasn't an accountant; for housing officers, we'd look for previous experience with customers.</p> <p>The advice I would give to any young person considering housing as a career is to contact a local association and see if you can do a couple of weeks' work experience to see if you like it. For many A-level students, a career in housing won't immediately spring to mind, but for anybody taking the trouble to find out about it, I think they'd be really surprised at the variety of work on offer.</p> <h2>Roger Keller, head of education at the <a href=\"http://www.cih.org/\" title=\"\">Chartered Institute of Housing</a></h2> <p>I think there is no best solution for the A-level student thinking about a career in housing. A full-time university course can open up all sorts of opportunities and the chance to find out what you really want to do \u2013 but at a cost. However, getting a job in a housing organisation and then taking a part-time route to a degree and professional membership is the most cost-effective route. But I would argue that a housing degree will provide the best foundation on which you can build a career in housing, whether taken full-time or part-time<em>.</em></p> <h2>Anonymous, a retired housing development manager</h2> <p>Housing is not an easy field to work in, but it can be a very rewarding job: you are really helping people's lives. Nearly everyone in housing, including those with degrees, starts at the bottom and works their way up. Some move up a lot quicker than others.</p> <p>It depends very much on what aspect of housing the 18-year-old would like to work in: development, maintenance, housing management, social regeneration, sales and marketing, finance, IT, HR? In most housing associations and local authorities, each department focuses on their own field. Only in the very smallest housing organisations would someone gain experience across a range of fields, except through shadowing and job swaps. It is only too easy to focus too much on one's own department, although the whole organisation and the residents benefit if those working in housing can see beyond their own field. It is fairly difficult to move from one field to another unless you have relevant experience in the new field.</p> <p>It is quite difficult to get into housing without any experience, even at the trainee level. Some large housing associations take on graduate trainees, who are very fortunate: they can take up three- to six-month placements in a series of departments over three years to get a better picture of the organisation.</p> <p>If an 18-year-old wants to aim high, at a senior or specialist job in housing, I suggest a good option would be to get any good academic degree and do some voluntary work connected with the housing field you want to work in. Make contacts with housing associations in your local area, and ask for holiday period placements (probably unpaid) while you're at college. Include housing co-ops and residential homes in your considerations. For housing development, maintenance or sales and marketing, other relevant property experience is very helpful, such as working for a private developer or estate agent.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<h2><strong>TOIL can be hard work \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://uk.linkedin.com/in/richardjcatherall\" title=\"\"><strong>Richard Catherall</strong></a><strong>, director of Katarsis Ventures</strong></h2> <p>I remember working late every night for a week to do the additional tasks that I would otherwise have delegated if the company had been big enough. Blasting the month's targets out the window, I quipped to the manager that I could do with an afternoon off. \"Do you have enough holiday? Is it worth wasting it? It's nearly the weekend.\" Not quite the \"Sure, why not now, let's grab a pint!\" that I had I expected.</p> <p>Several years later, now a director myself, I came into the office at 7am. How surprised I was to find the receptionist there, bright and breezy, without even the lights on. \"Good morning, can I get you a coffee? What are you doing in so early?\" I said. Turned out she had been doing it for weeks so that she could finish early at three. Here was me asking myself why do we have a receptionist who leaves two hours before we close when actually I should have been asking why do we have a receptionist who starts two hours before we open! The ghosts did however get a great service.</p> <p>The well intentioned norm that benefits should be universal can make a laughing stock of TOIL. Part-time workers for example. A friend ran a small company with part-time job shares and, like many organisations in the sector, it used part-timers for what ideally would be full-time jobs. All worked well until those full-time jobs he was squeezing into part-time hours generated TOIL, which ate away even the hours he could afford. Then the managers for whom the TOIL was perhaps offered originally ended up being unable to take that time anyway.</p> <p>With thousands of staff working at many sites, perhaps a culture of entitlement, autonomy and very good benefits is taken for granted. TOIL is regularly a trust issue because timesheets would need an industry of their own to monitor. Like the benefit, the trust is regularly universal, too. Lunch at the desk becomes an hour of research. Waiting for the lift home becomes preparation for tomorrow's meetings. This tale told to me by a local authority manager analysing his budget ... ironic, I thought, because tomorrow in his diary it just said \"WFH [working from home]\" ... isn't that something you do when you don't have enough TOIL?</p> <h2><strong>Let's foil TOIL \u2013 Karen Herbert, strategic development officer at Capacity Building</strong></h2> <p>Time off in lieu should be abolished; it serves neither the individual nor the organisation's best interests and has passed its sell-by date.</p> <p>In my experience, thankfully not many social enterprises operate such a system. Staff are paid for the hours they actually work, albeit at a low rate.</p> <p>I believe it is the traditional charity sector that still refuses to give up TOIL, not surprising considering the public sector background of so many practitioners. In my charity, where I line-manage staff, I find administering TOIL wastes an unreasonable amount of time for all of us.</p> <p>Why not pay overtime instead? If the hours are necessary, they should be paid for at the going rate. Typically, this is more cost-effective than hiring another member of staff and perpetuating the problem.</p> <p>We should pay people at a rate that makes them feel lucky to be in the sector, not penalised for a choice in line with their social conscience. Or do we really want all good staff to head off to the private sector and leave social enterprises without the skills and experience brought by right-minded individuals?</p> <h2><strong>Stay loyal to TOIL \u2013 Jessica Smith, director of </strong><a href=\"http://www.poachedcreative.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Poached Creative</strong></a></h2> <p>The extent of the debate sparked by Joe Saxton's blog initially surprised me. Shouldn't charities and social enterprises be setting a good example in terms of maintaining a healthy work-life balance for their staff?</p> <p>In a small social enterprise where every penny counts, paying staff overtime is not an option. But that doesn't mean we don't value the time staff put in and there needs to be some way of recognising that and paying it back. TOIL, when properly managed, fulfils this need.</p> <p>Our communications agency with a social purpose, <a href=\"http://www.poachedcreative.com/\" title=\"\">Poached Creative</a>, works to slim profit margins and we simply wouldn't survive without flexible working. For us, this means a combination of part-time work, flexible hours and TOIL.</p> <p>Much of our work is project based and to tight deadlines, so there will often be weeks where we need staff to work more than their 35 hours to complete a project. That time can then be reclaimed when things are quieter, such as over Christmas and during summer.</p> <p>We have a flexible working policy that's explained to all staff. Absences, leave or extra hours worked are all noted on timesheets and an attendance chart.</p> <p>Our team includes people with mental health difficulties, disabilities and addiction, so flexibility is key to keeping them at work and helping them to manage their lives outside. Simple solutions such as later starting times work for the company, too, because often we'll run training or events in the evenings, where certain staff need to be on hand.</p> <p>As a director, I expect to work more than a 35-hour week but, equally, if there's weekend work attached to a project or I've put in particularly long hours over a sustained period, I will take time off when things are quieter.</p> <p>Before setting up my social enterprise I worked in a number of charities and media organisations and have always used TOIL to take some well-earned extra holiday, making sure I've given a little more than I take back.</p> <p>I firmly believe that time off in lieu is the right way to value something that means more than money \u2013 your time.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can you succeed in journalism \u2013 or any creative career \u2013 when you can't afford an internship?</p> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Hope for an inheritance.</p> <p>Who gets to be a journalist? I do, now, and the fact stuns me. For five years, I worked at a series of marketing companies and non-profits: jobs I wasn't crazy about, but took because they allowed me to withstand the monthly double-penetration of Toronto rent plus student loan payments. I was trying, and largely failing, to write at night, on weekends, and on my two weeks of holidays per year. I'd bought into that old saw about struggling for one's craft, as well as the updated version, <a href=\"http://www.gladwell.com/outliers/outliers_excerpt1.html\" title=\"\">Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hours rule</a>, but my day jobs paid so little that, more often than not, my free hours had to go to remunerative work \u2013 more of the same. This routine produced such a cloud of emotional exhaustion that a whole season could pass before I noticed that I hadn't written a word. Before I went freelance, I was ready to give up.</p> <p>And then I got money. I didn't earn it; in fact, it came as a complete surprise, an inheritance from a money-under-the-mattress relative. Not a large sum by most people's standards, but enough to pay off the remaining balance on my student loans. And while I'm relieved, I still can't shake a feeling of guilt. It's not that I feel like a cheat \u2013 I've long realised that money is necessary to launch a creative career. How else does one do an unpaid internship? But the fact that I've proved the rule in my chosen profession makes me wonder just what kind of profession it is.</p> <p>This is about more than money; it's about class. I didn't always understand this. When I was struggling, I suspected that my failure was due to lack of funds. I'd transcended my blue-collar roots, I thought: I'd been to university; I didn't work, as my mother might say, \"with my hands\". And I blamed myself. I told myself I wasn't trying hard enough, that I was too impatient. I saw this in my failure to pound out essays after long days at work, and in my weird, jagged career trajectory. I wondered if I was too lazy, too restless to succeed, not cut out for the kind of heels-dug-in effort that creative careers require.</p> <p>But three months post-money, I don't feel restless anymore. Cash has changed my perspective as well as my bank balance. I now recognise the fight-or-flight skittishness that ran through my 20s as the erratic rhythm of poverty \u2013 not just poverty as financial fact, but poverty as culture. I was following the money, playing a kind of vocational <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole\" title=\"\">Whac-A-Mole</a> that is as much a working-class phenomenon as scratch cards; as much a signifier of my class as taking a \"gap year\" is for others.</p> <p>My parents went through the same thing. My father worked as a miner, a taxi cab driver, and a contractor, respectively; my mother was, at various times, a waitress, a maid, and a secretary. Poverty doesn't allow you to develop a linear career trajectory or a coherent professional identity, because when cash is hard to come by, you do whatever job will bring you more of it. But when you apply this short-term logic to a creative field, especially one that requires as much patience and investment and dues-paying as journalism, you come away with nothing.</p> <p>To be a writer in this market requires not only money, but a concept of \"work\" that is most easily gained from privilege. It requires a sense of entitlement, the ability to network and self-promote without seeing yourself as an arrogant, schmoozing blowhard. And it requires you to think of working for free \u2013 at an internship, say, or on one of those gratis assignments that seem to be everywhere now \u2013 as an opportunity rather than an insult or a scam.</p> <p>It's difficult to believe now, but journalism wasn't always an elite pursuit. My grandmother was a journalist; she got her newspaper job with an application and a folder of clips from her college paper. In early high school, I babysat for a columnist who advised me to \"keep knocking on doors.\" These were people from the era of pounding the pavement, and from them, I got the impression that journalism was a gettable, middle-class job. Why wouldn't it be? My grandmother wrote about public housing and mortgage rates.</p> <p>I grew up in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which means I spent my formative years under a comet-adorned poster that said \"Reach for the Stars!\" Still, I didn't think my goals were stratospheric. I understood that my life would look nothing like the lives of my rich classmates, who were poised for business, medicine, or law \u2013 avenues that required connections and expensive professional degrees. Instead, I'd graduate from university, get an entry-level job at a newspaper or magazine, and \"work my way up\". The world of newspapers and magazines seemed just the place for a typical working-class kid, strong-headed and mouthy, used to observing things from the outside.</p> <p>During my student years \u2013 years that were more about juggling waitress jobs than enjoying campus life \u2013 I began to hear that journalism was changing, becoming more competitive. But, naive as I was, I thought that meant I'd be OK: as long as I worked hard, I could compete. It wasn't until a few months after graduation, during a long, fruitless string of informational interviews at Toronto magazines, that I began to understand what \"competitive\" really meant.</p> <p>\"This is becoming something of a glamour industry,\" said one editor, leafing through my clippings behind his cluttered desk. He looked genuinely sorry about it, but that didn't stop me from hating him as he explained how the internet had eviscerated the field. Entire departments were being laid off, he explained, and entry-level positions were becoming obsolete, or going exclusively to graduates from internship programmes. \"Which I encourage you to apply for,\" he urged, his voice brightening. As if this were a moment of hope.</p> <p>He went on, but I wasn't listening anymore. There was no way I could do an unpaid internship. Three months of unpaid work would cost at least $4,000 (\u00a32500); my student loan debt already totalled $50,000. My monthly payments were $600, and rent in Toronto would be the same \u2013 I was avoiding the latter burden for the time being by living with my mother, but she was a receptionist, and couldn't reasonably support me for much longer. Plus, there was no way I could ask her to get on board with my taking a job with no salary, especially when it didn't promise a real position \u2013 just a chance to apply for one.</p> <p>I lit a cigarette in the building's great stone entrance, looked down at my portfolio, and felt, for the first time, embarrassed by it. Although I had felt my debt like a weight as soon as I took it on, it wasn't until that interview that I saw it for what it was: a gap between me and the life I'd prepared for. I began to realise that debt would drive me harder than ambition, and in a different direction.</p> <p>Weeks passed. More editors at cluttered desks, more exhortations to apply for internships. Finally, I signed up at an employment agency, hoping that they could find me something for the time being. Amazingly, a job in publishing did come up, but there was a catch: it was on reception.</p> <p>\"I want to make this clear: you will be answering the phones,\" said the CEO at my interview. He'd had it up to here, he explained, with eager grads thinking they could work their way up to an editorial position, neglecting the duties they'd been hired for.</p> <p>I said \"of course\", though privately I was scheming how to work my way into an editorial position. For a while, it seemed likely: I handled some overflow editing and did photo research for the production department. But my salary was in the low $20K range \u2013 not enough to make my loan payments plus rent.</p> <p>When the going gets tough, the terrified apply to grad school. On the computer at my reception desk, I researched the numbers. A master's in journalism would cost at least 20K, no exceptions. But there were lots of grants for people studying the humanities. In a PhD programme, I could make $25,000, now, and I wouldn't have to pay back my student loans for four years. In a PhD programme, I could rent my own place.</p> <p>I went to grad school. I rented my own place. On $25K a year, things were tough (I copy-edited e-books in my downtime), but not having to make my monthly loan payment made an incredible difference, as did the cost of rent in Ontario: $600 for half of a house, probably a third of what I'd pay in Toronto.</p> <p>That I explicitly treated my doctoral programme as a kind of debtor's refuge does not mean I didn't want to be a professor. But the year I graduated, there were just two full-time jobs available in my field (19th-century literature) in North America. I learned that the average wait time for a tenure-track job was five years, during which time one was expected to teach classes on a casual basis. The average part-time professor at my university made $5,000 per course, about $20,000 per year.</p> <p>The dream of being some sort of writer persisted, even though I knew it was bullshit. It trailed me like a shadow and startled me at banal moments: the middle of a phone conversation, staring out the bus window on my way home from class. I would open a magazine only to seize up with bitterness and regret.</p> <p>When I graduated from my PhD programme, I was out of work for six months. I moved back in with my mother. She could help me pay for food, but not much beyond that, so when the hunt for barista jobs failed, I applied for <a href=\"http://www.mcss.gov.on.ca/en/mcss/programs/social/ow/\" title=\"\">Ontario Works</a> [welfare payments]. Here are those working-class values again: talking publically about being on welfare is taboo, and I feel awful discussing this. Still, my discomfort now is nothing compared to the shame I felt trying to explain my situation to a caseworker. I felt like the kid in the fairy tale who, attempting to escape the treacherous forest, takes refuge by accident with the resident witch. The path I thought would lead me out of poverty had delivered me right back into its maw.</p> <p>With my start-up jobseeker's fund, I bought a skirt suit and a Metropass; I applied for all sorts of jobs. Every once in a while, I'd try for a position that sounded editorial-ish, but I wasn't counting on getting one. In a brief vista of escape, an old contact of mine, the columnist I used to babysit for, recommended me for an internship \u2013 a paid internship! \u2013 at the Toronto Star. I had worried that I was overqualified, but on the phone, a co-ordinator told me that more and more of their interns had PhDs; unfortunately, I was turning 30 that year, the programme's cut-off age.</p> <p>Finally, on the merit of those e-books I'd edited, I found a job editing free magazines for a marketing company. This might sound like a break \u2013 I certainly hoped it would be \u2013 but in reality, the gig was about as low-paying and dead-end as my receptionist job in publishing had been. How much this job resembled the one I hankered for was a cruel irony: I wrote advertorials that looked like real articles; at junkets, I met people who worked at good papers and magazines, in Xanadus walled off by internships and contacts. They were all nice people, but my encounters with them were gauzy with self-pity and envy. I wondered which of them had interned and how much start-up capital interning had required; what their parents or spouses did; who might have helped them and for how long. In their writing, I thought I caught traces of an easy ascent: the nostalgia for a middle-class childhood, the self-assured tone.</p> <p>I get to write now because I have privilege. I have always been privileged, of course \u2013 I am white, able-bodied, and I was born in Canada \u2013 but getting to write requires even more privilege than those facts confer. I know I shouldn't feel bad about my inheritance \u2013 It's equivalent to parental funding, or a relative who knows the boss, or the subtle, psychological advantage that accrues when 3/4 of your brain isn't always devoted to scheming up the rent. It is the kind of advantage one needs to make it in my industry. Had I not received the money, I would certainly have failed, if only because I would have given up.</p> <p>I feel grateful to have the privilege to write, but now that I have it, what can I say? I worry that in the transition from poor to comfortable, I've lost something crucial: a certain edge, a sense of anger. I fear I've lost the qualities that could connect me with readers like my parents, who are struggling in ways I don't anymore: trying to eat and pay rent, and using the time leftover to forget all that trying. If journalists are envoys from a \"glamour industry\" \u2013 if their lives are as removed from the lives of most people as mine has become \u2013 how much faith can we place in their accounts?</p> <p>I suspect that all of this \u2013 the unpaid internships, the nepotism, the alarming spread of unpaid assignments \u2013 will come to a head soon. As I write this, people are lobbying for laws to protect interns; online, they decry media elitism with mounting intensity. When the current setup falls apart, I hope I will be front and centre to cheer its demise. But the thing about privilege is that the more you have of it, the less you remember it's there.</p> <p>\u2022 This piece was originally published in <a href=\"http://www.hazlittmag.com\" title=\"\">Hazlitt magazine</a> and is republished with permission</p>",

  "<p>Am I alone in my dismay at the way BBC's 10 o'clock news covered the imminent government reshuffle on Monday evening? Political editor Nick Robinson presented his piece to camera from a casino with a female croupier in the background \u2014 and sometimes in close-up - shuffling a deck of blue and yellow cards. </p> <p>In order to maintain some kind of interest, she tried a variety of deft shuffling tricks while Robinson - bereft of any real information - filled air space. Not content with that, he finished his report with a weak joke about a cat outside No 10. Why? </p> <p>That's the question I ask, and attempt to answer, in my London Evening Standard column today, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/incoming/bbc-on-a-loser-as-it-tries-to-make-big-deal-out-of-a-shuffle-8106503.html\">BBC on a loser as it tries to make big deal out of a shuffle</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The night was already surprising enough before a man in a bathrobe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/quebec-elections-parti-quebecois-minority\" title=\"\">shot someone</a> outside Pauline Marois's victory rally in downtown Montreal. Only a short time earlier, separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ) leader Marois became the province's premier-in-waiting, gathering 54 seats in the National Assembly and a minority government. The shooting will likely go down as a disturbing moment in Canadian political history. But what about the <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/quebecvotes2012/story/2012/09/03/quebec-election-night-results-2012.html\" title=\"\">election results</a>?</p> <p>As Quebecers woke up this morning to the new world of a PQ minority government (and say goodbye to now-former premier Jean Charest, who was unable to hold his own seat), the rest of the country will equally be wondering what comes next. That includes those just over the provincial border in Ottawa, where the ghost of past national existential nightmares is looming once again. Marois's victory means that, like it or not, the question of separation is back on the table in Canada. In August, Marois told reporters that the government would have final say on any question of sovereignty, but the PQ platform posited that a referendum could be held on any issue that garnered 15% support from Quebecers \u2013 about 850,000 people \u2013 by way of a signed petition. It's ambiguous enough to keep everyone guessing, as it is no doubt designed to do \u2013 especially for those outside Quebec.</p> <p>While the prime minister, Stephen Harper, congratulated Marois in an official statement on her Tuesday night victory, he said that \"We do not believe that Quebecers wish to revisit the old constitutional battles of the past.\" The federal Conservative government, he said, \"will continue to work with the government of Quebec toward our common goals.\" But it might be worth asking at this juncture what those common goals are. The government's recent agenda and its decisions regarding federal gun registry and employment insurance have put it at odds with Quebec. As much as Marois was fighting her opponents in Quebec, she launched a seemingly equal number of jabs at the prime minister and Ottawa, telling her supporters she would fight to regain more sovereignty in ways that are surely not possible, such as the demand that Quebec begin handling its own employment insurance, overseas aid and even citizenship. In each case, Ottawa would be constitutionally forced to oppose, thus leading to further animosity and, Marois must assume, an increased perception that the federal government is acting against Quebec's interests.</p> <p>For the federal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party\" title=\"\">New Democratic party</a> (NDP), Marois's victory is perhaps even more interesting. The party holds 58 seats in Quebec \u2013 far more than the Conservatives, who only managed to hold on to five in the 2011 federal election. Since its groundbreaking result, the NDP has positioned itself as a staunchly federalist party, and its leader, former Quebec Liberal party cabinet minister Thomas Mulcair has already promised that by the time Quebecers go to the polls again, there will be a provincial NDP there, waiting for their votes. Already the NDP has made a serious attempt to position itself as the only federalist choice for Quebecers. Marois's victory may have made that argument even stronger.</p> <p>In the meantime, Quebec might transform. If the PQ fulfils its campaign promises, Quebec public servants will no longer be allowed to wear any religious symbols except for the crucifix (that would include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah\" title=\"\">yarmulkes</a> and head scarves), non-French speaking Quebecers will be barred from public office, and there will be even further restrictions on the use of English in schools and workplaces. Should all of that take place, Quebec is at risk of suffering a population drain, as its citizens \u2013 particularly its Anglophones \u2013 start to look to the rest of Canada for a less discriminatory environment. Which would be an unfortunate and disturbing result indeed.</p>",
  "<p>It's said that you can't polish a turd, but every now and again (like this week) the world of politics suggests that if you get enough turds in one place, you can<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_reshuffle\"> reshuffle</a> them and hope it looks like a polishing.</p> <p>Of course, I mentioned this on Twitter. However, I largely follow, and am in turn followed by, scientists and geeky types, and there's nothing scientist and geek types love more than pointing out that someone is wrong about something/anything. So I was told, several times, that <a href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/mythbusters/\">Mythbusters</a> have demonstrated that it is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiJ9fy1qSFI\">indeed possible to polish a turd</a>. And just as a heads up, that previous link is NSFPE (Not Safe for People Eating).</p> <p>I don't know what the take home message of this is, except maybe that, when it comes to improving your image, politicians are worse than turds? But then, it seems it doesn't matter what party you're in or what your views are, if you're a mainstream politician you have to work hard to simply not be automatically loathed.</p> <p>I understand relatively little about politics, and for the sake of my fragile sanity I like to keep it this way. I observed the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19475248\">recent reshuffle of the UK cabinet</a> with little interest. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/aug/24/prince-harry-lance-armstrong-psychology\">As is my wont</a>, I was more interested in the general reactions, which ranged from the resigned acceptance of a prisoner observing that the most sadistic guard is wearing a new shirt, to the outright horror of someone who's just noticed their inebriated taxi driver is wearing a necklace made of human ears. Nobody I know of is happy about any of the changes, at any rate.</p> <p>But as a scientist, this confuses me. The general consensus among many is that things will be much worse as a result of this reshuffle, but why would our prime minister actively make things worse? A reshuffle is a typical response to falling polling figures and public disapproval, so making things worse is logically the last thing someone who wants to hold on to their job would do, what with <a href=\"http://www.enotes.com/self-preservation-reference/self-preservation\">self-preservation</a> being such a powerful motivator.</p> <p>So, a thought experiment. As far-fetched as it may seem to many, let's assume that:</p> <p>A. There is a logical rationale behind all of the changes made in the recent reshuffle, and<br>B. Each change is intended to benefit the UK as a whole.</p> <p>It may be quite a stretch, but let's assume David Cameron is acting for the good of everyone. Whatever the reason, let's assume Cameron meant well with even the more controversial changes to the cabinet. </p> <p>As mentioned in the headline, the main concern people seem to have is the appointment of the health secretary. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lansley\">Andrew Lansley</a> has been sacked and replaced by<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hunt_(politician)\"> Jeremy Hunt</a>. This has a lot of people worried, given Hunt's lack of experience, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/04/jeremy-hunt-nhs-tribute-homeopathy?newsfeed=true\">controversial views on healthcare</a> and previous record of being a<a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2012-04-28/voters-think-jeremy-hunt-should-resign/\"> corporate stooge</a>. Lansley wasn't popular, but many see this as being a case of out of the frying pan and into a worse frying pan, one with a lot of crap still stuck to it from the last time it was used and wielded by a chef who enjoys giving people food poisoning</p> <p>But as suggested, maybe there is a rationale for this. For example, despite his record, Hunt is 10 years younger, noticeably slimmer and has got much darker hair than Lansley. Ergo, he looks healthier, which is reassuring for a health secretary, like having your optician wear glasses. People are <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9516.html\">more approving</a> of more \"vibrant\" looking individuals. </p> <p>But Hunt may also help the health services of the UK, albeit inadvertently. He <a href=\"http://thewall.co.uk/topics/34218-jeremy-hunt-new-health-secretary-called-for-the\">officially doesn't like the NHS</a>, and most people tend to avoid things they don't like. Rather than progress with<a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e709\"> Lansley's chaotic reforms,</a> Hunt may spend three years making excuses to avoid dealing with it at all, thus limiting the damage. </p> <p>Hunt is also seemingly <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100179258/jeremy-hunt-health-secretary-thinks-homeopathy-works/\">pro-homeopathy</a>. I've made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/aug/16/antidote-celebrities-promote-homeopathy\">my views on homeopathy quite clear</a>, but Hunt may wish to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/may/31/timeline-jeremy-hunt-bskyb-bid\">increase the role of homeopathy in the NHS</a>. Similarly he wanted to increase the role of Sky in the British media, and that <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/rupert-murdochs-expansion-hopes-crushed-after-bskyb-bid-collapse-6421709.html\">didn't end too well</a>. He may well work similar magic with homeopathy during his time in the post.</p> <p>But even if he does go ahead with the expansion of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/may/03/hinchingbrooke-hospital-eyewatering-cuts\">private involvement with the NHS</a>, the main company involved in this so far seems to be<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson\"> Richard Branson's</a> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9176733/NHS-patients-to-be-treated-by-Virgin-Care-in-500m-deal.html\">Virgin</a>, whereas Hunt is unquestionably <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19127427\">Rupert Murdoch's man</a>. There is <a href=\"http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/sky-reignites-public-feud-with-virgin-media/2056673.article\">no love lost between Murdoch and Branson</a>, so maybe with Hunt in charge this feud will extend to private health care? Like pitting an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-10817277\">insidious virus against an aggressive cancer</a>, maybe the two companies will spend so much time fighting each other they'll be too depleted to wreak further damage to health service, assuming it's still standing. </p> <p>Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction. There's a slim chance that a similar principle is at work here, in that Hunt's failings will help cancel out Lansley's. One can but hope.</p> <p>Perhaps similar logic can be applied to the appointment of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McLoughlin\">Patrick McLoughlin</a> as secretary of state for transport? The main concern is that he will approve the building of a third runway at Heathrow. As a non-Londoner, this is a controversy that has passed me by, but apparently<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19484126\"> it's a big one.</a> It's believed that McLoughlin will approve a construction of a third runway as he has no prior involvement with the matter. </p> <p>However, the quote often used to refer to this is that he \"<a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/update/2012-09-04/mcloughlins-role-to-rethink-airports/\">carries no baggage</a>\" with regards to the matter. He may have been speaking entirely literally. Having no baggage is something that happens a lot after a visit to Heathrow. This would undoubtedly put him off wanting to increase the possibility of this happening with a third runway.</p> <p>A third runway also means more planes, and a man who is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-patrick-mcloughlin-transport?newsfeed=true\">afraid of flying </a>surely wouldn't want that. If anything, if his <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618597000091\">phobia is strong enough</a>, he could irrationally want to reduce the number of planes currently operating out of the UK altogether, perhaps by converting existing runways into ludicrously long basketball courts. </p> <p>McLoughlin may end up inadvertently doing <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/aviation_climate_change.pdf\">more for the environment</a> than an<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/apr/19/eyjafjallajokull-volcano-climate-carbon-emissions\"> Icelandic volcano</a>.</p> <p>There may even be a reason for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Clarke\">Kenneth Clarke</a>, who has gone from secretary of state for justice to minister without portfolio. This seems like a demotion of a popular, established politician, but it may be a calculated move. Clarke is now a wealthy figure with a lot of time in his hands, a taste for dispensing justice and one who has been let down by authority figures. These are ideal circumstances to cause him to become some sort of <a href=\"http://darkanon.edublogs.org/2011/03/23/top-10-comic-book-vigilantes/\">vigilante hero</a>, dealing with criminals using his own resources at no cost to the state. </p> <p>I'll stop this line of thought there though, as it could eventually lead to images of Clarke in<a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=lycra+catsuit\"> tight lycra</a>, and nobody needs that.</p> <p>For obvious reasons, I've focused on the changes that have a potential scientific impact (health, environment \u2026 Batman) but there may be a similar, positive rationale for all of Cameron's cabinet changes. Or, more likely, this whole post is just a jumble of extreme extrapolation and half-baked theorising that would do a conspiracy theorist proud. Either way, it can't be as bad as the reality seems to be.</p> <p>Science is all about challenging boundaries and investigating the new, and I just wanted to see if it was possible to write an article with a positive interpretation of the recent reshuffle and have it put up by the Guardian.<br>If you're reading this, then apparently it is.</p> <p><em>If you're interested, Dean Burnett sometimes manages to sufficiently pad out his knowledge of politics to fill 140 characters on Twitter, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a><br></em></p>",
  "<p>EasyJet is ending the desperate rush for prime seats on low-cost flights by launching allocated seating across its network.</p> <p>Having been eschewed by budget carriers in the past for impeding fast turnaround times, the Luton-based airline said seat allocation did not appear to slow down journeys and is more lucrative than speedy boarding schemes. It expects 1a and 6a to be the prime picks on flights following trials on 6,000 flights this summer.</p> <p>Allocated seating will be rolled out across easyJet's network from November, with all passengers allocated a seat. Those wishing to change their seat will be charged \u00a312 for front row and over-wing seats, \u00a38 for berths in the four rows behind the front row, and \u00a33 to reserve a seat anywhere else on the plane. Passengers who don't pay for a particular spot will be randomly allocated a seat as well when they check in, free of charge, although the chances of getting a seat up front will be diminished. \"The majority of people will not have to pay for their seat,\" said an easyJet spokesman, adding that the airline would attempt to seat families together even if they don't pay for specific seats.</p> <p>EasyJet has mulled allocated seating trials in the past but Carolyn McCall, easyJet chief executive, has decided to push ahead after a trial scheme showed encouraging results. The trials found that on short-haul flights such as London to Glasgow, the \u00a33 window seat 6a was the most popular, while on longer routes such as London to Sharm el-Sheikh the \u00a312 1a berth is the most sought-after due to the more substantial legroom. Predictably, seats in the middle and near the back found the fewest takers, with 16b the least desired on short haul and passengers avoiding 19b on long haul.</p> <p>\"This is an example of easyJet trying to do all it can to make travel easy and affordable for our passengers,\" said McCall. \"Our customers asked us to trial allocated seating and we are really pleased with the positive passenger feedback during the trial. As importantly, we have shown that we can do so while delivering strong on-time performance \u2013 the most important driver of passenger satisfaction.\" EasyJet said that more than seven out of 10 passengers on trial routes preferred the system to speedy boarding, where passengers pay around \u00a310.50 to board a flight first \u2013 a service also offered by Ryanair.</p> <p>Low-cost airlines have been characterised by their strategy of charging for as many services as possible, from inflight food to checking bags into the hold. However, some notions such as allocated seating have been ruled out by the likes of Ryanair because of their potential to clutter up planes, which would prevent low-cost carriers from executing the 25-minute turnaround times \u2013 the gap between a plane arriving at its gate and pushing off again \u2013 that allow them to run the busiest possible timetable.</p> <p>Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, said the move would benefit easyJet because it gives the airline the opportunity to make money from all seats on a flight rather than the 30 berths set aside for speedy boarding. \"We would expect sales of pre-allocated seat selection and premium seat allocation in the front of cabin and exit rows to certainly exceed speedy boarding revenues. Speedy boarding was limited to 30 passengers per flight, but we imagine a higher share of passengers will opt to secure their seats in advance of travel.\" He added: \"Moreover, we think the switch to allocated seating will make travelling on easyJet notably less stressful. It will be far better for families travelling together. It will also remove the hassle of boarding which we think has been a material deterrent for business travellers. It should also be helpful for relations with airports: as customers spend less time standing in queues for hours before the flight, they should be free to spend more time and money in airport stores.\"</p> <p>However, Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Espirito Santo bank, said easyJet is replacing one of its most dependable sources of ancilliary revenue. \"These charges replace speedy boarding, so this is not wholly incremental. But the hope is to make at least slightly more money than they were making before.\"</p>",
  "<p>Reports that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/quebec-elections-parti-quebecois-minority\" title=\"\">gunman at a Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois victory rally</a> muttered \"the English are waking up\" in accented French while being escorted to a police cruiser will send a chill through Canada.</p> <p>One person died and another was critically injured in the shooting during a speech by the separatist group's leader, Pauline Marois, newly elected as Quebec's premier. To many, the gunman's alleged comments will raise fears that long-simmering tensions between the province's anglophones and francophones, separatists and federalists, are once again coming to the boil.</p> <p>Tuesday's election took place against a backdrop of corruption scandals involving the Liberal-led administration and widespread protests over tuition increases. The protests, which were supported by PQ, escalated into an Occupy-style \"Maple spring\" with environmentalist, anti-capitalist and separatist overtones. Police arrested 2,500 people and authorities enacted new legislation restricting public demonstrations in the province.</p> <p>Quebec has held two referendums on secession, the second of which, in 1995, was voted down by a margin of less than 1%. Polls show two-thirds of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois say they are not interested in sovereignty, making a third referendum unlikely under Marois's tenure.</p> <p>She has pledged to keep her party's separatist agenda alive by pressing the government for gradual gains in autonomy. \"We want a country. And we will have it,\" she said on Wednesday morning before the gunshots sounded and plainclothes security officers whisked her off the stage.</p> <p>Language policy has long been a source of tension in Quebec. Marois has drawn criticism from anglophone groups for proposals to strengthen the province's charter of the French language, often called Bill 101. She has proposed legislation requiring immigrants who run for public office to be proficient in French, and restricting access to English-language junior colleges.</p> <p>\"Ottawa should be worried, but I don't know if they are worried,\" Antonia Maioni, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said on Tuesday. \"Not because of the immediate threat of separation, but because Madame Marois will be rattling the constitutional cage in a way that we haven't seen over the past decade.\"</p> <p>Shootings are rare in Canada, and Quebec's last incidence of political violence was in 1970 when the leftwing labour minister Pierre Laporte was kidnapped by a radical Quebec group and later found dead in the trunk of a car. On Wednesday, police were keen to stress that the motive behind the latest incident remained unclear.</p> <p>Pundits and politicians called for anglophones and francophones to remain united. \"We are appalled by this violence,\" said Carl Vallee, a spokesman for the federal prime minister, Stephen Harper. The liberal MP Denis Coderre said on Twitter: \"We are living through a political attack. We must show solidarity to protect our democracy.\"</p>",

Senussi has been in custody in Mauritania since March, after slipping illegally into the country.</p> <p>Officials in Tripoli could not immediately confirm Senussi's extradition, also reported by Mauritanian television. But foreign ministry spokesman Saad al-Shelmani said the country's transitional post-Gaddafi government welcomed the news.</p> <p>He added: \"We have been asking for this move for a very long time.\"</p> <p>Senussi, Gaddafi's former director of military intelligence and a brutal enforcer, is one of the world's most wanted men. Libya, France and the international criminal court had all sought his extradition, with France seeking to question him in connection with the bombing of a French UTA passenger plane in 1989.</p> <p>The ICC has indicted him for crimes against humanity in Libya.</p> <p>Britain also has a strong interest in Senussi and is likely to seek to interview him in connection with the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, in which 270 died. At the time, Senussi headed Libya's external security organisation. He is said to have recruited Abdel-Basset al-Megrahi, the man convicted of the bombing. Megrahi died at his home in Libya in May.</p> <p>The US is also seeking Senussi's arrest in connection with Lockerbie.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Libya's prime minister, Abdurrahim el-Keib, said that as well as his alleged role in the Lockerbie bombing, Senussi knew the identity of the killer of PC Yvonne Fletcher, shot dead outside the Libyan embassy in 1984.</p> <p>\"He's the black box,\" Keib said, adding: \"I guarantee he [Senussi] was almost directly or indirectly involved in most if not all of the crimes [of the former regime]. That doesn't mean others weren't involved. But he definitely knows who they were.\"</p> <p>Senussi was married to Gaddafi's sister-in-law, and was at the Libyan dictator's side for over three decades. Leaked US diplomatic cables describe him as a trusted \"senior regime figure\", \"who had played a role as minder of the more troublesome Gaddafi offspring\".</p> <p>They added: \"Sanussi&#xa0;\u2026 is usually in physical proximity to the tent in which Gaddafi holds meetings with visiting foreign dignitaries and, according to members of Gaddafi's protocol office, personally oversees Gaddafi's close protection detail\".</p> <p>Libya's provisional government wants to try him in connection with numerous human rights abuses, including the massacre of 1,200 prisoners at the Abu Salim jail in 1996. During the 2011 Libyan civil war, he was blamed for orchestrating killings in the city of Benghazi and recruiting foreign mercenaries.</p> <p>Senussi reportedly fled Tripoli as it fell to the rebels in August 2011, going first to Sirte and then heading southwards, home to his Megarha tribe before going to ground in Ghat. In October, when Gaddafi was killed, he crossed into Niger with a Tuareg escort. In November, according to reports, he was first in Mali then Mauritania and finally Morocco.</p> <p>Senussi arrived in the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott, from Casablanca on a scheduled Royal Air Maroc flight on 16 March. Mauritania said he was identified in a routine passport check but Arab sources claim French intelligence was involved in the operation.</p> <p>The Moroccan magazine Telquel reported that he had been under surveillance for some time by Moroccan security services. Senussi remains a man of mystery and intrigue, but one thing is certain: Libyans want to see him in the dock.</p>",
  "<p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/leo-tolstoy\" title=\"\">Tolstoy</a>, the theatre is often something to be mistrusted, both as art-form and social occasion, a place of absurdity and vanity either side of the footlights. Famously, the one thing he personally disliked in Chekhov was his habit of writing for the theatre, and said to him: \"Shakespeare's plays are bad enough, but yours are even worse!\" So it is an interesting, even subversive idea for screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/02/tom-stoppard-anna-karenina-tolstoy?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Tom Stoppard</a> and director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/joe-wright\" title=\"\">Joe Wright</a> to have contrived an adaptation of Anna Karenina set in one place: a theatre.</p> <p>Here is where the show and theatricality of high society is underlined, where the norms and hypocrisies of public life are conspicuous. Scenes will begin in the theatre building, on stage, or in an auditorium where the seats have been removed, often among costumed extras who will freeze like waxworks while the principals exchange dialogue. Or sometimes, characters will tensely quarrel backstage amid the ropes and pulleys controlling the scenery. This approach gives the scenes which really are set at the theatre a hyperreal quality, though the film's action will at times open out into the normal sets and outdoor locations of a regular adaptation.</p> <p>It's a magic lantern effect, a rhetoric of unreality. The group scenes often make the film look like a musical without the songs. It sometimes has the effect of re-focusing our attention all the more sharply on to the performances, although I sometimes felt that it should either be done completely stylised or not at all, an absolute one-location movie, or a conventional one ranging far afield.</p> <p>Keira Knightley is very good as Anna, suggesting a new subtlety and maturity in her acting. She is the artless wife and mother, married to a pinched and prim government official, Alexei Karenin. In this role, too, Jude Law gives a thoroughly intelligent performance. Bearded and bespectacled, he behaves like an ascetic or a priest who increasingly disapproves both of others' weakness and his own enforced tolerance. Anna has come to Moscow from her St Petersburg home on a mission of mercy: her scapegrace brother Oblonsky (Matthew Macfadyen) has been caught by his wife Dolly (Kelly Macdonald) having an affair with the family's former governess. (Oblonsky's is the unhappy family described in the book's famous opening sentence; where all happy families are alike, his is \"unhappy in its own way\".) Anna, with her delicacy and tact must speak to Dolly, persuade her to forgive and forget and keep the marriage together. Yet through an ironic wrench of fate, it is on this visit that she meets the mercurial and handsome young army officer, Count Vronsky, played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/02/aaron-taylor-johnson-interview?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Aaron Taylor-Johnson</a>. There is a spark between them, and Anna finds herself set on a terrible, fateful path.</p> <p>The film version skates over that other half of the story which concerns Oblonsky's friend Levin, played by Domhnall Gleeson, a wealthy idealist who has come to town to propose to the beautiful Kitty (Alicia Vikander), also being courted by Vronsky, but deeply wounded and downcast is forced to retreat to his country estates and find some consolation in pursuing a life of simplicity, close to the land and to God. His story is hardly as sensational and dramatic as Anna's, and yet without the mystery of seeing Levin's life juxtaposed with hers \u2014 they actually have a connection in the book, not hinted at here \u2014 the story loses some of its perspective and its flavour. Gleeson does well in this demanding role, reduced though it is.</p> <p>As Vronsky, Aaron Taylor-Johnson certainly brings conceit and a callow self-regard. He preens well. As in his earlier movies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135252/kick-ass\" title=\"\">Kick-Ass</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/132848/nowhere-boy\" title=\"\">Nowhere Boy</a>, he is an attractive, open presence, but he is out of his depth here, especially when he has to suggest Vronsky's later agony and wretchedness, and the fact that he, as well as Anna, has made sacrifices for their affair.</p> <p>And so the tale continues, interestingly, if somewhat disconcertingly, in this semi-permeable fantasy theatre, from which the characters make their periodic excursions into the outside world. It is probably most startling when the racecourse scene is actually held indoors, in the theatre. The horses parade round and round the auditorium itself. That's certainly striking, though audiences of a more down-to-earth cast of mind could be forgiven for wondering what the smell would be like, and where the guys with shovels are standing.</p> <p>More successful, and more moving, is a tableau later in the film which shows the gentle meadow where Karenin comes to terms with his memories, or perhaps it is rather the meadow where Anna had her most ecstatic intimacy with Vronsky. Surreally, miraculously, this meadow is spread over the theatre; the building is carpeted with flowers. A dream of freedom and contentment has spread itself out in a place which until then had been a venue for anxiety and unhappiness.

She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... the Department for Work and Pensions has assessed me as being fit for work. Not only that, but after my WCA, an appointment through which I sobbed as I described how severely my life is limited by my condition, I scored zero points out of the 15 necessary to remain on Employment and Support Allowance (sickness benefit). Despite submitting a lengthy letter detailing how my condition and my meds affect me, letters from my Consultant showing ever-increasing levels of medication, and a medical certificate recording me as unfit for work until at least the end of September, my benefit has been stopped.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>And she adds </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I guess I could wait until my current contract is wrapped up and start looking for another job. Of course an employer would have to be happy with me working just a few hours a day and being slow and stupid in the mornings, and with me not being able to commit to actually turning up from one week to the next, and variably crying or bouncing around manically in the office. But I'm sure there are hundreds of employers out there who would be cool with that, especially in a recession, right?<br>Or I can appeal. The Government's own figures show that that of the large number of appellants against WCA decisions, 40% are successful. For me, an appeal is not even about the money aspect; I am only entitled to ESA until October anyway, as I am on the \"contribution-based\" from which only lasts a year (because that's obviously completely adequate for supporting people with life-long conditions). It's about a system that refuses to tell its subjects who is assessing them and whether the [healthcare professionals] or Decision Makers have any training in mental health issues. It's about a system that requires a horribly distressed person to share the intimate details of how her condition disables her, and takes mere attendance as evidence that she is fit for work.<br>Damn straight I'll be appealing.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 An interesting post on the LabourList blog by Teresa Pearce, Labour MP for Erith and Thamesmead, in which she argues that <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/09/how-to-improve-labours-general-approach-to-welfare-issues/\" title=\"\">Labour should rethink its welfare policies</a>, \"particularly the primacy of the '<strong>tough on scroungers</strong>' line\". She explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When that is seen by many as our only message on welfare, we have a problem. The values behind the welfare state our party created; that those that can work should do so, and those that cannot work should be supported, can get lost. 'Tough on scroungers' can slip easily into 'tough on benefits' and stigmatise whole groups of people in the process. The continuation of the 'tough' message is our response to polling data on attitudes towards people on out-of-work benefits, who are frequently categorised as lazy or pretending to be unable to work. If we want to be an electorally successful party, they say, then we need to look at what people think and what they want from a prospective Government. Whilst that is true to an extent, political parties do not exist just to reflect people's attitudes back to them. Political parties should be driven by values and the New Labour obsession with polling as our primary driver needs to take a back seat whilst we look at what, and who, our party stands for ahead of the next election.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 A great question from the Same Difference blog, <a href=\"http://samedifference1.com/2012/09/05/why-cant-you-get-wheelchair-basketball-on-playstation/\" title=\"\">why can't you get wheelchair basketball on Playstation?</a> The topic was apparently raised during Channel 4's Paralympic coverage. Blogger Sarah Ismail writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I see no reason why today's children and teenagers shouldn't be able to play wheelchair sports games on games consoles. To me this seems like wheelchair dolls and teddy bears. Just like wheelchair using kids play with dolls and teddy bears, and should be able to have these toys in wheelchairs, they also play with games consoles. Wouldn't it be brilliant if they could see themselves on computer games?<br>Wouldn't it be brilliant if non-disabled children could learn through computer games that wheelchair sport does exist?

  "<p>More than ever, consumers in the west are linked with producers in Africa through their product purchases. This trend is likely to increase as retailers in Europe and the United States look more to small scale farmers in developing nations as environmentally sustainable sources of food supply.</p> <p>When they do, these retailers require high standards of quality, timely delivery and, in some cases, certified sustainability, such as the <a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/\" title=\"\">Rainforest Alliance </a>seal. But small-scale farmers \u2013 the 500 million farmers who have less than two hectares of land \u2013 can struggle to meet these demands. They are often marginalised, both geographically and socio-economically. They tend not to have the seeds, fertiliser or capital they need to sell into more demanding retail markets.</p> <p>Although both smallholders and retailers can benefit from trade with each other, their two different worlds can seem difficult to reconcile. For the past four years, my colleagues and I at the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\">International Institute for Environment and Development</a> have been trying to understand how innovations to business models could bridge this gap.</p> <p>Our project \u2013 a collaboration with the <a href=\"http://www.sustainablefoodlab.org\" title=\"\">Sustainable Food Laboratory</a>, <a href=\"http://crs.org\" title=\"\">Catholic Relief Services</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/\" title=\"\">Rainforest Alliance</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/Paginas/index.aspx\" title=\"\">The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)</a> \u2013 was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In the coming weeks, it will publish its final four reports, each focusing on a different value chain that links small-scale farmers in Africa to consumers in the west. First up, are flowers.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/16037IIED.html\" title=\"\">the report we published today</a>, we describe a new approach to sourcing flowers from Kenyan smallholders direct to UK retailers. We learnt many lessons from this value chain but two stand out.</p> <h2>Bridging the supply chain gap</h2> <p>First, the supply chain needs a good intermediary that can provide farmers with both a route to market and what they need for production. Second, it needs individuals who can act as bridges throughout the supply chain, closing the gaps in communications, standards and delivery to build new relationships between smallholders and retailers.</p> <p>In our study, the intermediary company was <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/tag/wilmar-agro-ltd\" title=\"\">Wilmar Agro Limited</a>. Based in Thika, a two-hour drive from Kenya's capital, Nairobi, Wilmar sells flowers from smallholder growers to European markets.</p> <p>For many years, Wilmar has held contracts with over 2,000 smallholder farmers, from whom it buys flowers each week to sell at Dutch flower auctions. Wilmar has helped the growers set up bank accounts to receive their weekly earnings, and has provided them with low volume inputs and technical advice from trained extension agents in the field. One grower says that, as a result of all of this, he earns more from a quarter acre of flowers than his two acres of tea (another big smallholder crop in Kenya). But this was just a start.</p> <p>By the time our project had begun in 2008, Wilmar's success had made it keen to try new markets that might offer a higher and more stable income for its growers. Around the same time, in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.walmart.com/\" title=\"\">Walmart</a>, which owns <a href=\"http://www.asda.com/\" title=\"\">Asda</a>, had pledged to source an additional \u00a330m of fresh produce from African farmers by 2013. We saw that bringing these two players together could present a real opportunity to get smallholder produce on to the shelves of a leading UK retailer.</p> <p>We were keen to see what lessons could be learnt from this pilot effort to develop a new commercially viable supply chain that was socially and environmentally sustainable. But we recognised that we didn't have the required commercial expertise and relationships to do so. So we brought in two commercial consultants with years of experience in retail supply and an interest in more sustainable sourcing. They were able to build on their longstanding relationships and knowledge in the sector to create the necessary links between Asda and Wilmar. This meant establishing terms of trade beneficial to both parties. It meant developing the product to meet both Asda's consumer demands and the farming systems of the growers. And it meant finding solutions for day to day problems that were appropriate to both commercial and development demands.</p> <h2>Supporting smallholder inclusion</h2> <p>Today, Wilmar supplies flowers to <a href=\"http://www.samsclub.com/sams/\" title=\"\">Sam's Club</a>, a US subsidiary of Walmart, and has interest from a number of UK retailers that want to source their products. Although there were many challenges \u2013 in communications, quality control and timely delivery \u2013 what made this project a success was the role of the intermediary (Wilmar) and the commercial consultants working together to provide a business model that was supportive of smallholder inclusion and responsive to the demands of retailers.</p> <p>Many value chain projects have been set up to meet the development challenges of smallholder farmers and food security. Many of them struggle to find success \u2013 both commercially and developmentally.</p> <p>Proving the development impacts of these projects can be difficult, and take years. Finding a committed retail partner that is willing to ride the ups and downs of a more variable supply base can be tricky. But having in place a strong intermediary and a consultant who can work together to take the noise out of the chain and build strong commercial relationships while guaranteeing benefits to smallholders is a pathway to success and more sustainable sourcing from developing countries.</p> <p><em>Abbi Buxton is a researcher in the sustainable markets group at the </em><a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\"><em>International Institute for Environment and Development</em></a><em>. </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The morning began on a menacing note. \"You're not going to need your boots, boys,\" Chris Coleman told us, a group of journalists eagerly awaiting a training session with the Wales manager. Nervous glances were exchanged. It was cold outside and looked like it was about to pour; surely I hadn't come all the way to Cardiff simply to run around in the rain for an hour?</p> <p>The sight of an ambulance parked by the training pitch at the Vale Hotel, where the Wales squad will prepare for Friday's World Cup qualifier against Belgium, hardly offered reassurance. Quite the opposite, in fact. As a show of faith in our ability to handle what Coleman has got in store for us, it did not rank particularly highly. Nor did the fact that the team photograph was taken <em>before </em>the session starts, presumably because everyone was still standing at that point.</p> <p>Coleman quickly allayed our fears, though, and after a few laps around the pitch followed by some stretching to loosen up, the footballs were introduced, always a surefire method of inducing a sort of childlike glee in a group of grown men. Some were even talking about using this as an audition for the Wales squad, although as the only Englishman present, I kept my mouth shut. Anyway, Gareth Bale plays in my position.</p> <p>Although we were ostensibly there to experience the life of an international footballer \u2013 minus the Wags and money-spinning sponsorship deals \u2013 international managers tend to concentrate more on tactics due to only having their players for a short period, so Coleman's session was tailored for a club side, the kind they might have on a Monday or Tuesday after playing a match on the weekend.</p> <p>With 16 of us packed inside a small square, we were each given a ball and told to dribble around, changing direction, using both feet and making sure to avoid bumping into each other. Spatial awareness was essential. Watch Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez play and it quickly becomes clear that he always knows who is around him, even without looking. With teams aspiring to emulate the Spanish model, it's a useful skill to possess. Fortunately I managed to avoid any collisions, although fared less well when we had to juggle the ball solely with our right feet. Mine is used only in emergencies and the less said about my attempts to do the same with my head, the better. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CB0QtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4sYMdpzE8Mk&amp;ei=7ihHUJTSBom3hAeGkYBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEhtH6Hp-jOilY_Fqn5AD0zaSlnKg\" title=\"\">Mr Woo's</a> job is safe for now.</p> <p>As the subsequent possession drills demonstrated, Coleman is keen for his side to pass well, citing the success of Swansea City as proof of the value of keeping the ball. \"It's tiring without the ball,\" he said over and over again. It was hard to argue. Two larger squares were created and those on the outside of each one had to keep the ball away from two players in the middle. Once the ball had been won, you had to race into the opposite square and repeat the process all over again. Each pair had to win the ball three times. It might sound simple but it is not.</p> <p>Barcelona call it the <em>rondo</em>. \"It's all about <em>rondos</em>,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/11/xavi-barcelona-spain-interview\" title=\"\">says Xavi</a>. \"<em>Rondo</em>, <em>rondo</em>, <em>rondo</em>. Every. Single. Day. It's the best exercise there is. You learn responsibility and not to lose the ball. If you lose the ball, you go in the middle. Pum-pum-pum-pum, always one touch. If you go in the middle, it's humiliating, the rest applaud and laugh at you.\" There is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RNfaIW5k1g\" title=\"\">a clip</a> of the Bar\u00e7a players playing piggy in the middle before the Champions League final against Manchester United last year and it is one of the most incredible spectacles you could wish to see. Packed into a suffocatingly tiny circle, two players go into the middle and are routinely humiliated by the remarkable speed of their team-mates' passing, not to mention an outrageous array of flicks and tricks. It lasts 43 seconds but for the chasing pair it must have felt like an eternity.</p> <p>Of course, we did not quite reach that level, even if Coleman, barking encouragement in Welsh, admitted he was pleasantly surprised. I even earned a shout of \"well played\" after throwing someone off the scent with a swerve to the left.</p> <p>It was no less demanding to be on the outside of the square. You need to be quick and you need to think. Above all you have to move \u2013 intelligently. In one of the drills, Coleman showed us how valuable it can be to have one man in the middle to receive the pass, hold off a defender and move the ball on, thereby taking an opposing player out of the equation. \"When you're chasing the ball,\" he said, \"you're twisting and turning all the time. It's tiring.\"</p> <p>Crossing and shooting practice followed, although Coleman said that with sides moving away from 4-4-2 and to more progressive formations, those sort of exercises feature less now. The penalty competition we had probably doesn't feature at all (yes, I scored; left foot, bottom-left corner). We ended with a 15-minute match, using half a pitch and with each player restricted to two touches. The side I was on won 2-0. And then it was back to reality.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's right-tilting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2012/sep/05/cameron-reshuffle-pmqs-live-blog\" title=\"\">reshuffle</a> reminds me of Mitt Romney's selection of Congressman Paul Ryan to be his Republican running mate for the White House. The conservative press did its best to convince itself that Ryan was a great stroke, but couldn't quite manage it. Similarly sober is the mood this morning in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9520235/A-new-team-but-the-problems-dont-change.html\" title=\"\">Tory Fleet Street</a>.</p> <p>That's hardly surprising when the Mail relegates its reshuffle coverage to page six (the couple arrested for shooting a posse of intruders still dominate page one) while both Times and Telegraph make much play of Boris Johnson's outrage that Justine Greening has been removed from the site of Heathrow's prospective third runway.</p> <p>Zac Goldsmith, super-rich Tory MP for under-the-runway Richmond reinforced the negative overnight message by popping up on Radio 4 to remind ministers that, if they do a U-turn on Heathrow he will resign and trigger a byelection which he promises to win. Goldsmiths tend to mean what they say \u2013 and can afford to do so.</p> <p>At least the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/david-cameron-government-reshuffle-cabinet\" title=\"\">Guardian</a>, Indy and FT did Cameron the courtesy of ascribing ideological coherence to the shakeup on the grounds that Chris Grayling (justice), Owen Paterson (environment), Jeremy Hunt (health) and Grant Shapps (co-chairman) are all rightwing free-marketers who itch to do things to criminals, forests, healthcare and Labour voters.</p> <p>As for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-david-cameron-conservatives\" title=\"\">Lib Dems</a>, the coalition's fragility is reinforced. From separate duvets they are now moving to separate beds. \"Who cares?\" say Tory tough guys.</p> <p>I'm not wholly persuaded by this argument \u2013 nor is the rightwing press \u2013 for several reasons. Clearly Cameron wants better persuaders in post (Andrew Lansley couldn't sell gin to an alcoholic) as well as ministers he judges capable of getting things done. No 10 has reached the point all PMs reach where they realise that pulling the levers of power doesn't necessarily make anything happen.</p> <p>So it's all more about delivery than about policy which will remain the familiar batch of messy coalition compromises, prompting the Tory press to focus its dissatisfaction more and more on Cameron himself.</p> <p>In any case new cabinet ministers are inevitably a gamble. Few nowadays have enormous experience either in politics or outside life. I don't know Maria Miller, the low-profile appointment to succeed Hunt as culture secretary, a tricky post. I take that to be a good sign; she was minister for the disabled (another very touchy lobby) and doesn't show off. She was an advertising executive before politics, she has three kids.</p> <p>Does that mean she can do a big job under the spotlight of public and media attention in an impatient, often graceless atmosphere? We don't yet know, which is more than can be said for Hunt because we all saw him wilt in Lord Justice Leveson's witness box about his dealings with Rupert Murdoch. It wasn't a bad defence \u2013 \"I took independent advice as soon as I inherited the BSkyB brief\" \u2013 but he looked and sounded callow.</p> <p>He's been forgiven (moved, if you prefer) because he's deemed a good manager (he was in IT PR and directory publishing, he speaks Japanese) and promoted to a post where Tory ministers are rarely able to relax because the culture of the NHS is collectivist. Hunt seems to be anti-abortion, pro-homeopathy (argh!!) and as keen as most MPs to defend his own local hospital \u2013 in Guildford \u2013 from what might be sensible rationalisation of scarce resources.</p> <p>All the same, let's see what Hunt <em>does</em> as distinct from said in the past. The same goes for Grayling, who was pencilled in to slash the welfare reform programme until Iain Duncan Smith \u2013 unsackable as a hero of the right \u2013 dug his heels in and Grayling went to justice instead. Grayling (ex-SDP by the way) talks a tough populist game (watch out Brussels, watch out civil libertarians!), but can be a bit mouthy in a careless way.</p> <p>Another gamble then. Yet the realities of office and restricted choices, the burdens of vested interests, the caution of civil servants, all serve to restrict a minister's power. Besides, the centre is ever-dominant and cabinet office no longer the great fiefdom it once was. That's why the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">cabinet</a> is restricted by law to the PM and 22 paid members, yet today's revised lists include up to 30 members (in the Times).</p> <p>That's because membership and attendance has become blurred as the cabinet has decayed as a serious forum for policy discussion and decision-making over several decades. It's mostly done in committee and even smaller ad hoc groups, \"sofa government\" if you prefer. So Lady Warsi can tell her friends she's still in the cabinet (she isn't) because she attends it. Sooner or later the lady who brings round the tea and biscuits will be formally included too.</p> <p>In any case the policy on which this coalition will survive or fall \u2013 the strategy of economic austerity as the road to recovery \u2013 remains more or less in tact, with Cameron and George Osborne locked together. If anything the counterveiling forces have been weakened because Vince Cable now has two Osborne allies, Michael Fallon and Matt Hancock, riding shotgun in his department.</p> <p>Indeed the chancellor's spittle can be seen all over this reshuffle. Andrew Mitchell, who used to be a David Davis man but decided (correctly) that DD preferred to be an eccentric, is the new chief whip and an Osborne placeman with better access and clout than his immediate boss, the decent-but-discredited Lansley, now leader of the Commons. Cameron knows he must beef up his Commons operation to quell dissent and keep the troops happy.</p> <p>I can't spot anyone in the new cabinet lineup who is capable of changing the political weather, certainly not Shapps who usually sounds lightweight. Commentators have been saying this week that only Margaret Thatcher's 1981 reshuffles (there were two that year) made an impact by sacking the Tory \"wets\" (ie moderates), as did Gordon Brown's in 2008 when he brought back his old enemy, Peter Mandelson, to keep his flagging regime afloat.</p> <p>Yet Brown lost in 2010 as he was fated to do. The Labour reshuffle that might have changed everything was the one that didn't happen: Tony Blair never reshuffled Brown out of the Treasury to become master of his own house and was eventually reshuffled out of No 10 by Brown. When a governing party loses the mojo of authority not much can save it. One thing that can is lousy opposition \u2013 which is what Barack Obama must be counting on.</p> <p>A couple of mysteries in the reshuffle may be solved in the next day or so. Why did clever Nick Herbert, the police minister who has been promoting elected police commissioners, leave the government? Was it because he refused a sideways move and demanded cabinet rank? Naughty boy if that rumour is true. Or is there something else we don't know about?</p> <p>Secondly, who is Owen Paterson? I know him only slightly \u2013 here's his <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Paterson\" title=\"\">CV</a> \u2014 he seems pleasant enough, but other Tory MPs tend to be dismissive of him. He got sent to Northern Ireland \u2013 a quiet brief these days though he has handed it over to Theresa Villiers (who she?) just as north Belfast explodes into sectarian riot. That appointment could come to haunt Cameron if things get worse.</p> <p>Yet Nigel Lawson \u2013 younger readers may not realise that Nigella's dad used to be chancellor of the exchequer (1983-89) \u2013 popped up on telly on Tuesday to say that Paterson is one of the ablest people around the cabinet table. He also said that Ken Clarke is no threat to Osborne, who consults Ken all the time and will happily pick his brains as new minister without portfolio but with cigar. We'll see.</p> <p>Lord Lawson is no fool, as he would be the first to admit. So have we misjudged Paterson? If so, his climate-sceptic views (Lawson is a prominent climate sceptic, widely scorned for it by the science community) may come to matter. Taken in tandem with clever Nick Boles, newly appointed planning minister, this change of direction could be the one that matters.</p> <p>Bye bye to those huskie dogs Cameron embraced on his detox trip to the Arctic Circle, bye bye chunks of the green belt? That would suit Osborne too because he was never as green as Dave, and the Treasury never is. IDS may still be in place to thwart his \u00a310bn target for further welfare cuts \u2013 another battle to watch \u2013 but there is always somewhere else for the cutters to cut. Timber!</p>",
  "<p>When a little-known state senator in Illinois came to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Boston in July 2004, proclaiming \"the audacity of hope\", it propelled one Barack Obama into the national consciousness and four short years later into the White House. Tuesday night will be the chance of a little-known mayor from Texas, prompting questions of whether lightning can strike twice.</p> <p>Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, takes the stage in Charlotte this evening as one of the youngest politicians to be granted the honour of keynote speaker \u2013 at 37 he is five years younger than Obama was in 2004. More significantly, he will be the first Latino to address the Democratic convention in this way, breaking one more glass ceiling for this rapidly rising demographic force in American politics.</p> <p>Amid the inevitable speculation about whether Tuesday night will be the start of a journey that will put Castro in the White House in 2016 or 2020, the mayor himself, who is known for his poise and composure, is having none of it. He points out soberly that he is not the first Hispanic to deliver a keynote address at a party convention \u2013 Katherine Ortega did so at the 1984 Republican National Convention \u2013 and swats aside talk of him following in Obama's footsteps.</p> <p>\"I'll be in San Antonio for the next several years, if the voters will have me, and if I do a good job I'll look around and see what else there is available for me,\" he told the Guardian as he took a break from preparing to deliver the speech of his life.</p> <p>Despite such protestations, Castro and his speech are being talked up heavily by the Democratic hierarchy. Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, told a meeting of the party's Hispanic caucus that he had seen a couple of drafts of the address and predicted that \"10 years from now you are going to say I was there when he gave that speech\". Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the DNC, called Castro \"one of the key rising stars in our party and he is going to electrify the arena\".</p> <p>Castro was understandably reticent to reveal the content of his speech, but would say this: \"I am going to centre it around the theme of opportunity: how America created the theme of opportunity and how President Obama has helped to recreated it for the 21st century.\"</p> <p>The mayor talks passionately about 2012 as a crucial moment for the US, especially for American Latinos. \"There has never been a starker difference between the Democratic and Republican parties over how they represent Latinos. The problem of the Republican position is not one of tone, it is their policies,\" he said.</p> <p>He cites several ways in which he thinks Mitt Romney, Obama's Republican challenger, has staked out a position inimical to Hispanics. He points to Romney's pledge to repeal Obamacare on his first day in office and how that would be a blow to the 9 million currently uninsured Hispanic Americans who will have access to affordable health cover under the reforms.</p> <p>He points too to Obama's doubling of the Pell grants that fund student loans and have brought an extra 150,000 Hispanic students in reach of college education \u2013 and Romney's promise to slash federal funding for the US education department. And he talks about the 8 million Hispanic children who have benefited from changes in tax credits which he contrasts with Romney's tax policy that he said would favour the rich.</p> <p>\"Given all that it's no surprise that President Obama is winning the Latino vote by 70 to 30%,\" Castro said. \"The policies the Republicans have embraced are contrary to the interests of many families including Hispanics.\"</p> <p>Castro's ability to articulate the contrast between Obama and Romney in terms of the impact of their policies on Hispanics is of obvious appeal to his party's elite. The Latino population in the US has grown over the past 30 years from 6% to 16%, making them the largest minority in the country.</p> <p>Though just one in 10 eligible voters are Hispanic their presence is concentrated in vital battleground states such as Florida, Virginia, Colorado and Nevada. As Castro matures as a politician, the power of his ethnic group will grow with him \u2013 every month some 50,000 American Latinos turn 18 and gain the right to vote.</p> <p>No wonder then that the Democratic Party is focusing its attentions on the Latino vote this year. Castro aside, there are more than 800 Hispanic at the Charlotte convention - the largest number in US history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395678830\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346767229104/julian-joaquin-castro-010.jpg\" alt=\"julian joaquin castro\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Castro (left) and his brother, Texas state representative Joaquin Castro, will both speak this week.

She passed on a fierce belief in the value of education to her twin boys \u2013 Julian and his brother, Joaquin Castro, born one minute after him. The two are identical, to the extent that they have to signal the difference between them when appearing together at public functions by wearing different coloured ties. Julian also has the advantage of a wedding ring \u2013 he is married to a teacher called Erica with a three-year-old daughter \u2013 while Joaquin is single.</p> <p>The brothers have stuck closely together through the years, propelled by their mother's insistence on self-betterment. They went together to Stanford and then both went on to Harvard law school (another echo of the Obama life story). From there they both entered Texan politics, Julian rising to be San Antonio mayor and Joaquin entering the Texas legislature from where he is currently bidding to become the representative of the 20th district seat in the US Congress.</p> <p>Though Julian Castro, like his brother, is grounded in the Hispanic community, to define him exclusively as a Latino politician would be to make a big mistake. For a start, he doesn't even speak fluent Spanish \u2013 he was brought up speaking English at home, studied Latin and Japanese in school, and in the past few years has quietly been taking Spanish lessons.</p> <p>His world view is focused around policies and public service, not ideology, and though his Spanish is ropey he is fluent in the language of business. As mayor of San Antonio, the seventh most populous city in the US, he has seen it prosper to become the only major American city with a triple A rating from all three ratings agencies.</p> <p>His ambition as mayor, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITScnHWdvjA\">he said earlier this year,</a> was to \"orchestrate the greatest turnaround in achievement that any big city has seen within a decade, boosting the number of children showing up ready to learn, graduating from high school and finishing college\". When all children in Texas enjoyed the opportunities he had done, then the Lone Star state would be a guiding star for all of America.</p> <p>Such emphasis on opportunity and success, rather than narrow ethnic politics, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/magazine/09Mayor-t.html?pagewanted=all\">led the New York Times to dub him</a> a \"post-Hispanic Hispanic politician\". To which Castro tells the Guardian: \"I generally don't like labels. I have benefitted from those who came before me who went through a civil rights struggle to give us the opportunities they never had.\"</p> <p>But he adds that he sees himself as one of a new strain of minority politicians \u2013 he name checks the mayor of Newark, Cory Booker \u2013 who have \"a can-do attitude and are comfortable with the business community, but are also at home in the neighbourhoods that we grew up in.</p> <p>\"I don't think I'm unique \u2013 I'm part of a new generation of public servant whose goal is to represent everyone. I'm very proud of my heritage, but all of us are Americans first.\"</p>",
  "<p>A photograph believed to be an extremely rare image of Emily Dickinson has surfaced in her home town of Amherst, Massachusetts, showing a young woman in old-fashioned clothes, a tiny smile on her lips and a hand extended solicitously towards her friend.</p> <p>There is, currently, only one authenticated photograph of Dickinson in existence \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.amherst.edu/library/archives/holdings/edickinson/dickinsondag\" title=\"\">the well-known image of the poet as a teenager in 1847</a>. But Amherst College believes an 1859 daguerreotype may well also be an image of the reclusive, beloved poet, by now in her mid-20s and sitting with her recently widowed friend, Kate Scott Turner. If so, it will shed new light on the poet who, by the late 1850s, was withdrawing further and further from the world.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amherst.edu/library/archives/holdings/edickinson/new_daguerreotype\" title=\"\">The college's archives and special collections department</a> has subjected the 1859 daguerreotype, owned by a New England collector, to multiple tests, including an ophthalmological report, and says that all of the current evidence is in favour of the woman on the left of the image being Dickinson.</p> <p>Comparing the 1859 picture with the 1847 photograph known to be of Dickinson, Professor Susan Pepin of Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Centre measured eyelid and facial features of both women. \"The two women have the same eye opening size with the right eye opening being slightly larger than the left. The left lower lid in both women sits lower than the right lower lid,\" <a href=\"https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/428374/original/Pepin-rept-6-24-10.pdf\" title=\"\">she wrote in a report</a>. \"Other similar facial features are evident between the women in the daguerreotypes. The right earlobe is higher on both women. The inferonasal corneal light reflex suggests corneal curvature similarity, allowing us to speculate about similar astigmatism in the two women. Both women have a central hair cowlick. Finally, both women have a more prominent left nasolabial fold.\"</p> <p>Pepin concluded that \"after a thorough examination of both of these women's facial features as viewed from the 1847 and 1859 daguerreotypes, I believe strongly that these are the same people\".</p> <p>Amherst has also searched the Emily Dickinson Museum's textile collection and has found at least one fabric sample in a blue check it believes is a candidate for the dress the woman supposed to be Dickinson is wearing in the image. It is planning further work by a textile expert to determine whether the two are the same. The woman on the right, thought to be Kate Turner, is wearing widow's black, \"as would have been appropriate following the May, 1857 death of her young husband, Campbell Ladd Turner\", it said.</p> <p>Amherst does admit that the dress worn in the photograph by \"Dickinson\" does seem to be out-of-date for the late 1850s, but it believes that \"may be&nbsp;of less significance when one considers the 23-year-old Dickinson's comment to friend Abiah Root in 1854, 'I'm so old fashioned, Darling, that all your friends would stare'\".</p> <p>The college has released the image to the public in the hope that anyone with further information about the photograph will come forward, whether or not it is favourable to the college's proposed identification of the two women as Dickinson and Turner.</p> <p>If the daguerreotype is eventually proved to be Dickinson, Amherst believes it will \"change our idea\" of the poet, showing her \"as a mature woman showing striking presence, strength, and serenity\", rather than as a teenager.</p> <p>\"She (whoever she is)&nbsp;seems to be the one in charge here, the one who decided that on a certain day in a certain year, she and her friend would have their likenesses preserved. In fact, even if this&nbsp;photograph is not of Dickinson and Turner, it has still&nbsp;been of use in forcing us to&nbsp;imagine Dickinson as an&nbsp;adult, past the age of the ethereal-looking 16-year-old we have known for so many years,\" the college added.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2012 to correct the spelling of Amherst College Archives in the photo caption, from Amhurst College Archives.</p>",

A fund for disabled creatives to stretch themselves and think big; to push boundaries and deliver ambitious work. So who could apply?</p> <p>Due to the nature of various impairments and access requirements, not all disabled artists run companies or can directly access funding bids \u2013 so to include everybody, things were complex.</p> <p>Jez Colborne, for instance, has William's syndrome. A fantastic musician and actor, Unlimited gave him his first experience of stepping up to being author of his own creative concept \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.mind-the-gap.org.uk/irresistible/?page_id=28\" title=\"\">Irresistible, a song cycle of sirens</a> \u2013 which he has written and co-directed. But he couldn't have realised his vision without the application being written in partnership with Bradford based company <a href=\"http://www.mind-the-gap.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mind the Gap</a>, which works with learning disabled artists as creative equals.</p> <p>For Unlimited, it was essential that work was truly led by disabled people, following their aspirations and their visions, yet it was neither possible nor desirable for it to be for disabled people only. How do you assess and monitor that kind of control?</p> <p>Janice Parker, a dance artist and choreographer who defines herself as non-disabled, gained an Unlimited commission: <a href=\"http://janiceparker.co.uk/privatedancer/about/\" title=\"\">Private Dancer</a>. In her piece, disabled dancers have full creative control not only over what movement they share, but who gets to see it \u2013 each performer invites in only those whom they directly choose to experience the intimacy of their private dance. Some of her dancers are non-verbal and have impairments that would make applying on their own behalf impossible within current fundraising structures.</p> <p>And what could they apply for? Did the work have to be about disability? No, was the answer \u2013 why should it? Not all disabled creatives want to create work about their impairment.</p> <p>Some do, for example Stumble danceCircus director Mish Weaver, with <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/42690770\" title=\"\">Box of Frogs, a circus exploring bipolar disorder</a>. Others don't, such as Paul Cummins and <a href=\"http://www.paulcumminsceramics.com/\" title=\"\">his 15,000 hand-thrown ceramic flowers</a>. Again, it sounds simple, but the decision to allow artists to define the content of their work opened up the playing field to a much wider group than just the handful of known 'political' disabled artists. It allowed the inclusion of artists such as Helen Petts, Simon Allen and Bobby Baker, some of whom had never before defined themselves as disabled before.</p> <p>The questions keep on coming. Are all these artists happy being in a festival that brings them together under such a banner? Now 'outed', does this mean that future work will change, influenced by this new label placed upon them? Has the Southbank created a ghetto by programming Unlimited? Or is this the tipping point needed to truly transform the sector into an inclusive one?</p> <p>Those applying for the fund were encouraged to find mainstream partners and collaborators to help them stretch and grow \u2013 again, controversial for some as it appeared to require the involvement of non-disabled people within the process, which some disabled people were uncomfortable with as a requirement.</p> <p>For me though, it's this part of Unlimited that has real potential for legacy beyond 2012. Applicants were encouraged to be ambitious, and theatres, galleries, producers and others stepped up to support them. New collaborations aren't always easy, especially those in the spotlight of the world. Add to that the tension of working at the edge of peoples' capacity, the requirements of access for artists, key staff, and audience \u2013 'stretch' was definitely the word.</p> <p>Who put their hands up? Quite a list, including National Theatre of Scotland <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/content/default.asp?page=home_MenageATrois\" title=\"\">to work with dancer Claire Cunningham</a>, who turns crutches into objects of rare beauty; National Theatre Wales <a href=\"http://community.nationaltheatrewales.org/profile/KaiteOReilly\" title=\"\">working with Kaite O'Reilly</a> to capture disparate voices and translate them into stunning monologues; producers such as Iron-Oxide <a href=\"http://iron-oxide.org/\" title=\"\">working with Ramesh Meyyappan</a>. Even disability-specific companies stepped up to give over artistic control to disabled artists \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/aug/21/disability-arts-heart-n-soul-mark-williams-interview\" title=\"\">Heart n Soul supporting Dean Rodney</a> and Candoco creating main stage work by disabled choreographers <a href=\"http://www.candoco.co.uk/productions/unlimited/\" title=\"\">for the first time in the company's history</a>.</p> <p>And first to put up their hand, the Southbank Centre, who took on the challenge of collecting this array of gems into the jewel of a festival. On the whole they've done well, acknowledging there isn't just one party line here \u2013 the accompanying talks, debates and workshops were promoted under the banner <a href=\"http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/Events?item=1761\" title=\"\">Unlimited Voices</a>. Artistic director Jude Kelly opened proceedings by announcing that it was the most significant festival in the Southbank's history, for its transformative power for artists, audiences and the arts sector itself.</p> <p>Perhaps this is where the London 2012 legacy lies \u2013 marking a shift in the way in which work by disabled creatives is met and matched within mainstream contexts. There is a weight of expectation falling on each Unlimited commission, and especially on the Southbank Centre as host this week. Will they live up to the hype?

  "<p>It is telling that it has been a film-maker who has given us a fresh picture of what it means to be British. When politicians have tried to call up a sense of British identity they have been almost comically inept. Margaret Thatcher premised her market revolution on an image of the country as it might have seen itself in the 1950s, while Tony Blair always seemed to be on the brink of addressing us as fellow Americans. By presenting an inspiring vision of Britain that is rooted in present realities, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/olympic-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle has achieved what no politician has yet seriously attempted</a>.</p> <p>Boyle's magnificent Olympic ceremony has given Labour an opportunity to rethink what positive value national identity might have in Britain today. Labour has never been an anti-patriotic party, but the discomfort of much of the left intelligentsia with the prejudices that often go with patriotism has allowed British identity to be largely defined by the right. <a href=\"http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521858429_CCOL0521858429A007\" title=\"\">Orwell tried to define a patriotism of the left</a>, but that was more than 70 years ago; other, more recent, attempts have proved unsuccessful.</p> <p>Tim Soutphommasane's defence of multicultural patriotism has been taken up by a number of Ed Miliband's advisers. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jon-cruddas\" title=\"\">John Cruddas</a> \u2013 Labour's most gifted thinker \u2013 was among those who invited Soutphommasane to speak to a policy group during a recent stay in London, when he also met the Labour leader. The 29-year-old Australian is attractive to Labour for several reasons. Born in France of Laotian and Chinese parents, he has none of the baggage that many promoters of patriotism carry with them. Rightly, he sees that nationality is a work in progress rather than a settled condition bequeathed by history. But can his theories be applied in Britain? And do they answer Labour's needs at the present time?</p> <p>It is hard to avoid having doubts about the exercise. This is hardly the first time Labour has tried to redefine a classic conservative theme and claim ownership of it. Think of Blair, who started wresting law and order from the Tories soon after he became shadow home secretary in 1992. In electoral terms it was a winning strategy, but Blair benefited from an economic bubble. Does it make sense to focus on questions of national identity when the most challenging issues faced by the next Labour government will be those that come with zero or negative growth? Some who are close to the Labour leadership apparently think so.</p> <p>Academic debates about citizenship and multiculturalism have been going on for a quarter of a century or more. The vast changes that have taken place in the world during that period are significant by their absence from the literature, and in this regard Soutphommasane's study is a standard example of its genre. China is mentioned in the course of a sentence, and Russia and India \u2013 two radically contrasting experiments in marrying democracy with nationality \u2013 are not discussed at all. The longer history of the type of liberal nationalism that Soutphommasane favours is touched on only in passing. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini\" title=\"\">Mazzini</a> is cited briefly, but France \u2013 an exemplar of the modern democratic nationalist project \u2013 is considered mainly in the context of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8458831.stm\" title=\"\">Sarkozy's problems with the burqa</a>.</p> <p>Where the book stands out is in its nuanced treatment of liberalism, and it is this that accounts for its relevance in Britain. Soutphommasane is right in thinking that liberal values \u2013 however they are defined, which certainly shouldn't only be in terms of market choice \u2013 need to be embedded in a shared political culture, with a history and a sense of its own identity. But as he makes clear, the liberal tradition remains the starting point. Over the past few years new currents of thinking have developed that are hostile to liberalism. Wisely, Cameron and Miliband have kept Blue Labour and Red Toryism at a safe distance from any position of influence. Liberalism may have its problems as a universalising theory, but British society \u2013 for all its anxieties about crime and immigration \u2013 is as deeply liberal as any in the world. A party that turns its back on this fact ceases to be electable.</p> <p>Soutphommasane is less convincing when he suggests that the nation-state is the sole legitimate vehicle for liberal values. He is aware that national cultures commonly rest on mythic versions of history. \"An account of patriotic deliberation would be fatally weakened,\" he writes, \"if it does not address this problem of myth.\" What is needed, he tells us, is patriotic self-criticism: \"In most cases, the repudiation of a national myth would not constitute a repudiation of the national project.\" It is an unconvincingly formulaic response. Violence and exclusion are not incidental features of nation-building. Pretty well every nation-state in the world has come into being through a process involving war and assaults on minorities. The idea that this history can be peeled away to reveal a \"national project\" innocent of crime is high-minded self-delusion.</p> <p>The point has more than historical interest. Reading Soutphommasane, you would not realise that some liberal states have managed quite successfully without having a single, overarching national culture of the sort he advocates. Britain, Canada and Spain are not just multicultural societies. They are also multinational polities. Yet for Soutphommasane nationality seems to be singular by its very nature. He frowns on dual citizenship, writing: \"Any need for the expression of multiple cultural affiliations can be done at a level <em>other than</em> that of political membership (that is, within the limits of single-state citizenship).\" Reflecting the importance he attaches to the issue, the italics are the author's. But compelling people to adopt a single national identity \u2013 however multicultural \u2013 is not obviously an advance in liberal values.</p> <p>This country has been as much shaped by conflict as any other, but the ability to enjoy several national identities is one of the chief advantages of being British today. A new settlement between the country's nationalities should aim to preserve this freedom, not sacrifice it to a theory of nationalism. Insisting that nationality can only be properly accommodated in a single state is unlikely to ease the process. The impact of similar theories in many countries has been to justify secession and promote disintegration.</p> <p>It may be that this rebooted version of nationalism will go the way of the wisdom of crowds and the social animal \u2013 novel-sounding ideas that politicians thirsty for soundbites take up and then just as quickly drop. If so it will be a pity. Multicultural patriotism is the only kind that has a future in Britain, and Soutphommasane raises issues of undoubted importance with which Labour is right to engage. However, unless a Scottish referendum on independence or \"devo max\" reshapes the political scene before the general election, issues of national identity are not going to be make-or-break territory for Labour any time soon.</p> <p>The government is floundering because it has run out of options. The much-touted cabinet shuffle has done nothing to improve the situation. Though Cameron may have hoped to head off his party's restive right, demoting Ken Clarke and Baroness Warsi will not appease the neo-Thatcherites who seem bent on a rerun of the Conservative civil war that helped propel Blair into power. Nor will it do anything to diminish the mounting threat to the Tory leader from Boris Johnson. But if the government is reaching a point from which it can no longer recover, the fundamental reason is that it has lost credibility on the economy. With the coalition too fractured and fragile to change direction, Cameron can only hang on in the hope of something turning up. As long as Miliband and Balls can avoid destructive internal wrangles and being distracted by lesser issues, this strategic impotence on the part of the government is Labour's opening to power.</p> <p>The Olympics have left us with a sense that Britain is one of the better places in which to live. It is a feeling that could soon vanish without trace if the country enters an era of more or less permanent austerity \u2013 a realistic scenario that Miliband and his advisers show no sign of having confronted. Their reluctance to address the prospect is understandable, but fine talk of a new patriotism will count for nothing if the next Labour government lacks a strategy for dealing with the shrunken and enfeebled economy it will surely inherit.</p> <p>\u2022 John Gray's <em>The Immortalization Commission</em> is published by Allen Lane.</p>",
  "<p>The chancellor's signal of coalition <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19455195\" title=\"\">support for infrastructure projects</a> is tacit recognition that giving money to banks has failed. Now it is to be given to builders. To avoid the accusation that he has abandoned fiscal restraint, George Osborne's parliamentary bill will offer \u00a360bn of funding \"guarantees\". This is a posh word for subsidy. (If I offer my teenage children a \u00a360 \"funding guarantee\", then they are likely to spend \u00a360. Indeed, it would be a point of honour not to do so.)</p> <p>According to the prime minister, the idea is to end \"dithering\" but it is not clear who the ditherers really are. The proposal trailed at the weekend will impact on only 25% of projects identified under the government's national infrastructure plan, published last year. There is no strategy for the remainder.</p> <p>The coalition's infrastructure plan earmarked 500 projects worth \u00a3250bn. Of these, 40 were designated \"critical for growth\". Schemes valued at \u00a340bn in transport, utilities, energy and communications have stalled. \u00a36bn of public private partnerships in health, housing and education were described as \"shovel ready\". (That means they have stalled, but with planning permission.)</p> <p>So which lucky projects and professional teams are covered by the \u00a360bn trailed by Osborne? Which are \"critical for growth\"? None has been confirmed, although it is a fair bet that a new runway at Heathrow airport is not among them. That is critical for the Conservative party. It will take longer than this parliament to resolve. Instead, the emphasis will be on housing, where \u00a310bn of the total guarantees will be designated.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the new measures also include a second wave of reform to the planning system in England and Wales (the measures do not apply in Scotland). Here, the government's logic is at first sight impeccable. If you eliminate \"planning risk\" (the danger that locally elected councils and officers dither over the grant of planning permission), then you remove at a stroke a significant reason to call upon the government's funding guarantees. At a time when the government has no money, this appears prudence with a purpose.</p> <p>Nor is the political price as heavy as first appears. At one level it marks the death-knell of \"localism\". More changes to local planning powers mean that the big society's little platoons will no longer be able to say \"no\" to unwanted development that cuts across local authority boundaries. But ministers will simply tell councils that the continuation of their development pre-emption rights is a luxury in a stalled economy.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the coalition's thinking here is based on a false premise. Of all the reasons behind Britain's stalled infrastructure (the paucity of debt and equity funding remaining the most significant), planning scarcely represents a major blockage. Under existing law, English local authorities already have to decide on planning applications in 13 weeks. (In my experience, having made nine successful major planning applications since 2006, councils always conform strictly to the rules.)</p> <p>To be required to wait just over three months to ensure the quality and appropriateness of developments that will impact the public for many decades is a small price to pay. It is one that educated and intelligent developers always accept. Indeed, it is in their commercial interests to have developments that communities support.</p> <p>The real threat to the coalition's new infrastructure plans comes from quite another direction. This is the danger that we will all pay more for it than is necessary. Francis Maude, the minister at the cabinet office, has quietly been getting on with his own reforms to procurement and construction. A savings target of \u00a330bn identified in the 2007 cost review aimed to streamline the delivery of capital projects.</p> <p>His measures are sensible. New project insurance models could reduce costs and encourage collaboration. They are long overdue. Public procurement in the good times saw bad practice. A \"claims\" mentality prevailed. It was a conspiracy against the public. The use of BIM (3D building information modelling programs) is likely to be made compulsory. It will discomfit professional cadres who keep project information to themselves. The taxpayer will no longer be billed for duplicated data.</p> <p>Maude's team in the Treasury has also begun to publish evidence of past extravagance.</p> <p>In one example, it has identified NHS acute hospitals built in a range up to \u00a35,000 per square metre. At this rate, surgical operations could be conducted on beds of gold leaf encrusted with rubies.</p> <p>The target is to take up to 20% out of the cost of construction. This does not sound like enough. Hospitals can be built for around half the price and, like Circle healthcare's new Bath hospital, designed by Norman Foster, still achieve stunning levels of quality. As Dogberry says in Much Ado About Nothing, \"comparisons are odorous\". Maude should publish and be damned.</p> <p>The government should go further. One measure above all would reduce the taxpayers' exposure to billions of funding guarantees for new infrastructure. In a manifesto aimed at the industry, the government should publish the maximum price it is willing to pay for all new public construction, and not a penny more. Like a hanging before breakfast, this should concentrate minds. Procurement rules can be made to fit. The industry will huff and puff. Then they will unite to make schools, hospitals, universities, airports and roads more affordable. They have nothing to lose but their supply chains.</p>",
  "<p>Americans do not get irony, small portions and cricket. End of and fact. We know this because it says so in our Little Book of Stereotypes That Ignore Britain's Obese Obesity Problem, The Work of Larry David and America's Burgeoning Cricket Culture. Those jokes aren't funny anymore; those familiar with the work of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_King\" title=\"\">Bart King</a>, the remarkable 19th century fast bowler from Philadelphia, would tell you they never were. But the putative American still serves as a useful tool for celebration of cricket's unique depth and eccentricity. The five-day draw is the most common example of this \u2013 how could an American <em>possibly</em> understand \u2013 although there is an even better example in the England side at the moment.</p> <p>Consider this for a logic googly. Person A is the most successful attacking player in his team when they play the least attacking of the three forms of cricket, yet in the two more attacking forms of the game he cannot get a game. He is kept out of the side by Person B, even though he is essentially superior in both roles that their position demands. Welcome to the curious case of Matt Prior and Craig Kieswetter.</p> <p>The Spin is openly in love with Matt Prior. If there was a free-for-all to touch his beard, we'd break sexagenarian bones to secure our place at the front of the queue. Last week he was inevitably named in the ICC Test World XI. Of the three England players in that side \u2013 Alastair Cook and Stuart Broad were the others \u2013 Prior's place is probably the most secure. He is a class act who was man of the series against South Africa and ensures every stone is turned in his attempt to become as good as he can be. There's even a bit of an aura around him. His selflessness, professionalism, excuse-aversion and excellence are such that, with Andrew Strauss gone, he is arguably the most impressive man in the England team. And although disciples of Alan Knott's genius would legitimately be appalled at the suggestion, in purely statistical terms there is a strong case for Prior making an all-time England Test XI.</p> <p>Yet he can't even get in the current England one-day and T20 XIs. The man in his place has to work particularly hard to win affection, and not just because he is ahead of Prior. If the Spin had a shiny new coin for every time we had heard somebody opine that Kieswetter has to dropped, usually with a cussword or three, we wouldn't be writing this on a Tuesday night to earn a crust. It's said that England haven't replaced Paul Collingwood, and it's true that in Test cricket they still have no middle-order firefighter, but he does have a spiritual heir in Kieswetter: the man who, at least in the the public eye. is forever fighting for his place. His South African background surely doesn't help. The criticism of Kieswetter peaked during the second ODI against South Africa, when he dropped three catches, none of which were extremely difficult. During the next ODI, the excellent South African journalist Neil Manthorp wrote on Twitter that \"Kieswetter is proving to be South Africa's best export yet. For South Africa\".</p> <p>Yet, as befits a short international career that has gone up and down like a demented graphic equaliser, Kieswetter came back to star in England's win on Sunday. His three stumpings were an England record, and he finished the match with an exhilarating straight six off Dale Steyn.</p> <p>Kieswetter has six appeal in spades. He has hit 30 of them in 42 ODIs, and is <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=sixes;team=1;template=results;type=batting\" title=\"\">already eighth on England's ODI six-hitting list</a>, even though everybody above him has played many more games. He has spanked a six every 35 balls, which compares favourably to some other English big-hitters: Andrew Flintoff (every 40 balls), Sir Ian Botham (every 61), Eoin Morgan (every 65 in his England ODI career), Kevin Pietersen (every 67). Even around the world, few can beat Kieswetter's six ratio. Chris Gayle hits one every 52 balls, Virender Sehwag every 58; Adam Gilchrist managed one every 67. Shahid Afridi clears the ropes every 21 balls, as does Kieron Pollard, but there's no shame being behind them.</p> <p>In that sense, Kieswetter is a special talent. There are no guarantees he will make it, such is the nature of sport and the imperfections in his game, but he has palpably got something. Anyone who can drive Steyn down the ground for six cannot be ignored, and his ability to recover from a number of setbacks in his short international career suggests considerable resilience. It's also easy to forget that he was man of the match the only time England became world champions, against Australia in the World Twenty20 final of 2010 \u2013 yet even in that game he was dismissed in vaguely absurd circumstances, making so much room that he ended up offering no stroke to a ball from Mitchell Johnson that sent his off stump flying. He is a rare mix of imperiousness and haplessness, world-class instinctive brilliance and club-cricket ineptitude.</p> <p>Behind the stumps he often takes amazing full-length catches and then drops regulation chances. Kieswetter's detractors wonder why he England should take such risks when there is a velvet-gloved alternative in Prior. Every Kieswetter drop is scrutinised, whereas a Prior drop is seen almost as a Halley's Comet moment. Prior has earned that right \u2013 but then again Kieswetter, who is still only 24, has surely earned the right for people to accept his keeping will improve, just as Prior's did after a traumatic start to his international career.</p> <p>When Duncan Fletcher preferred Geraint Jones to Chris Read in 2004 he argued that, whereas you can teach someone to catch a ball, you can't teach them to score Test hundreds. Prior arguably proves this point. He scored a hundred on Test debut but struggled with his keeping in his first year of Test cricket. When he was dropped, ridiculed publicly for his keeping and his perceived role in the jellybean fiasco, he took his medicine and improved immeasurably. It might be stretching it to expect Kieswetter to become as good with the gloves as Prior, but he has shown a significant improvement since the start of his England career. You can teach someone to catch the ball, and to manoeuvre the ball around for singles (Kieswetter's dot-ball ratio is probably higher than it should be, although in this, too, he is improving). But you cannot teach them to hit the greatest fast bowler in the world down the ground for six. In a side that has very few regular six hitters, this is a priceless quality. Jonny Bairstow offers an intriguing third option, but it is easy to say why England persist with Kieswetter.</p> <p>All this might be moot if Prior batted as well in ODIs as he does in Tests, yet his record is poor for a player of his abundant class. He has played 68 matches, making only two fifties in 62 innings, with an average of 24.18 and a strike rate of 76.76. Contrast that with Kieswetter's figures: he averages 30.59 with a strike rate of 92.53. He reaches 50 every sixth innings, rather than every 31st in Prior's case.</p> <p>There are mitigating circumstances. Prior made his debut as long ago as 2004, and most of those innings were played when he was not the mature talent he is today. He has also never had a defined role, batting everywhere in the order apart from No5, No10 and No11. (Yes, he really did <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/361046.html\" title=\"\">come in at No9</a> in an ODI.) In his most recent stint at ODIs, in the build-up to and during the 2011 World Cup, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/18675.html?class=2;spanmin1=05+Jan+2011;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\" title=\"\">Prior averaged under 20</a> and never really got to grips with opening or batting as a lower-middle order finisher. His strokeplay is perhaps too orthodox for him to bat down the order and succeed against defensive fields \u2013 the fact he hits a six every 278 balls to Kieswetter's 35 supports that perception \u2013 and that the only place for him to bat would be in the top three, when his bullying drives could pierce the field during the Powerplay overs. There is unlikely to be any room in that top three for a while, however, which is why Kieswetter is having to learn a new role at No6.</p> <p>Even when Prior did bat in the top three, as recently as last year, he struggled. He has played some sparkling innings for Sussex this year, particularly in T20 cricket, but it is not easy to know whether these are indicative of a player going to a new level or simply a high-class player taking apart county attacks. If England are to make the grand gesture of recalling Prior and dumping Kieswetter, they need to be pretty sure he can do to international bowlers what he has done at county level this season. And the problem of finding ways to score at the requisite rate has not gone away completely. In the context of a high-scoring CB40 semi-final against Hampshire last weekend, Prior's boundaryless 28 from 52 balls at No3 was arguably a match-losing innings.</p> <p>Other brilliant attacking Test-match batsmen have found their talent is lost in translation to the shorter forms of the game. Michael Slater (42 ODIs; no centuries; average 24.07; strike rate 60.40) and Michael Vaughan (86 ODIs; no centures; average 27.15; strike rate 68.39) are the two most obvious examples. You can have as many theories as you like, but sometimes there is no grand reason; a slowish start to an ODI career simply begins to perpetuate itself for the usual human reasons. There is much talk of one-day specialists, yet for every one of those there must logically be a Test specialist. Prior is 30 now and, although it seems daft to say about a player of such talent, we may have seen the last of him in coloured clothing for England. Alanis Morissette might call the situation ironic. To the rest of us it's just another example of why cricket is an endlessly fascinating game.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/signup/2010/mar/30/1\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Spin, the Guardian's free weekly cricket email.

  "<p>At a time when there has been much talk of legacies, it is perhaps worth considering that of the social care minister <a href=\"http://www.yourlocaltheguardian.com/news/9909576.Burstow_loses_government_post_in_Prime_Minister_s_reshuffle/\" title=\"\">Paul Burstow</a>, now that he has returned to the back benches in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservative-and-liberal-democrat-cabinet\" title=\"\">cabinet reshuffle</a>.</p> <p>I remember being in a room packed with third-sector, social-care leaders early in his period of office when he begged us to have trust and not to judge progress by the first year, but by the government's overall achievement. The sector was supportive. Burstow came with strong credentials: a parliamentary commitment to the rights of older and disabled people and an understanding of social care. He made efforts to meet people and listen to what they had to say. The words \"carer\" and \"service user\" were rarely off his lips.</p> <p>However, the government's record for social care is a far from reassuring one. The promise was for comprehensive and unified policy reform which would transform legislation and practice and at last put social care funding on a sustainable footing. This positive package is, clearly, no longer on offer. What has been left is much more worrying.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/personalisation\" title=\"\">Personalisation</a> and personal budgets, to which the coalition nailed its colours as the route to good practice \u2013 as did New Labour before it \u2013 appears to be coming apart at the seams. Many service users, carers and practitioners have expressed their worries about them. The rhetoric about \"transformation\" has been lost in fears that, as implemented, personalisation is creating at least as many problems as solutions.</p> <p>As for social care funding, it was only last month that messages went out that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/16/coaltion-rethink-dilnot-commission-old-age-care\" title=\"\">the government had changed its mind</a> and was now planning to go with the Dilnot recommendations in some form. But since these were proposed, increasing concerns about how well Dilnot's recommendations will actually work, and how much they will actually cost individuals who need care, have been raised by the private sector and local government, adding to those highlighted by services users.</p> <p>Social care seems to be a key area of policy where the fault lines between the coalition parties can be seen. We saw a dramatic expression of this just before the last general election on an extended live Channel 4 news item. Spokespeople for all three main political parties were given the chance, in front of a social care audience, to set out their positions. While Labour and the Liberal Democrats were happy to talk in the spirit of consensus, Andrew Lansley was not, highlighting the gulf between the Conservatives and the other parties. There is little sign that this has changed.</p> <p>Norman Lamb was the Lib Dem spokesperson for social care who took part in that discussion. He has now returned as minister and, like his predecessor, has a strong background of expertise and commitment in this field.</p> <p>Whether he will be able to bring any more success to the role than Paul Burstow remains to be seen. He will have to do so in a context of a cabinet shift to the right, continuing draconian cuts in local government spending, which particularly affect social care and its service users and, perhaps most of all, the most determined attack on disabled people through continuing welfare reform in modern memory.</p> <p>We may wonder what hopes there are as Lamb takes up his new office under his new boss, Jeremy Hunt. Social care activists are likely to be expecting more hard times and more hard struggle.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The arts in England stand at a crossroads. It is make or break time. The cabinet has its new culture secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/sep/04/maria-miller-culture-secretary-cabinet-reshuffle?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Maria Miller</a>; her predecessor's last action, before moving to the health department, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/04/peter-bazalgette-arts-council-england\" title=\"\">to announce the incoming chair of Arts Council England, Peter Bazalgette</a>, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/mar/23/liz-forgan-arts-council-england\" title=\"\">will take over from Liz Forgan when she leaves in January 2013</a>. Between them, they have the health and wealth of the nation's cultural life in their hands.</p> <p>Miller is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/feb/16/maria-miller-disability-minister-benefits-reform\" title=\"\">as yet an unknown quantity to the arts world</a>. She has a background in marketing and advertising. She studied economics at the LSE. She lists her interests as her children and local history. She has sat on the all-party advertising group and the all-party gas-safety group. As far as she is known publicly, she seems in the running, in a very stiff field, for the least cultured culture secretary ever \u2013 though it's entirely possible that she has all kinds of private cultural enthusiasms, and her stated interest in local history seems a good start.</p> <p>Does it matter if she has a tin ear for the arts? It depends. The best culture secretaries \u2013 Chris Smith and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/jamespurnell\" title=\"\">James Purnell</a> \u2013 did have a genuine, personal interest. So does <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edvaizey\" title=\"\">Ed Vaizey</a>, who remains the culture minister under Miller. But there's no reason that someone lacking a background in the brief shouldn't do well, as long as they have the flexibility of mind to \"get\" a sector where the rewards aren't always in flat statistics and raw outcomes (though they can be). Dan Jarvis, the army major turned shadow arts minister, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jan/09/dan-jarvis-shadow-arts-interview\" title=\"\">has made no secret of the fact that he's more comfortable in an Afghan foxhole than London's Royal Court</a>, but has worked hard to understand the issues that matter.</p> <p>So why are the arts at a crossroads? Since the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/spending-review\" title=\"\">2010 comprehensive spending review</a>, the arts have been cut to the bone. The Arts Council, while taking on the functions of other organisations, notably MLA, is currently slashing itself in half. While few would have denied that it needed a trim in 2010, this present cut is punitive and will see it struggling to perform its central task of effectively funding, supporting and promoting English arts. Arts organisations themselves are on the edge of their capabilities. Severe in-year cuts and another spending review round of similar severity to 2010's would cause palpable damage: theatres and orchestras would begin to close.</p> <p>And yet, there is an alternative way. The Olympics showed that, with the proper public investment and support, the arts can be a hugely important promoter of Britain. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2012/sep/04/jeremy-hunt-arts-legacy\" title=\"\">The unlamented Hunt</a> in fact understood this well: British culture has a tremendous power to attract economic activity and cultural tourism. By all accounts, Hunt did actively and energetically pursue this agenda in the run-up to the Games and during the summer. As it happens, in Scotland this is understood well too: leaving aside <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/09/arts-body-scottish-culture\" title=\"\">Creative Scotland's current travails</a>, cabinet secretary Fiona Hyslop's commitment to standstill funding for the arts comes from the conviction that culture is an important statement of national identity for Scotland, a powerful export, and a driver of tourism. Let's face it: the tourists don't come to England, or Scotland, for the weather. They come for the culture, the heritage.</p> <p>Over the autumn, figures will begin to be amassed on the economic impact of the cultural programme of the Games, and early hints are that they are impressive. In a climate when Britain has to do everything it can to find imaginative ways to drive the economy, this is a no-brainer. The amounts of public investment required are tiny (but necessary), and the economic rewards enormous. The coverage of the Cultural Olympiad in media all over the world (I've lost count of the number of times, in my peregrinations around the country in pursuit of the events of the <a href=\"http://festival.london2012.com/\" title=\"\">London 2012 festival</a>, I've either been just ahead of or just behind Chinese state TV). This is a moment that Miller and Bazalgette must grasp, not squander. Bazalgette \u2013 the effective and committed chair of English National Opera \u2013 will understand this well. When next summer's tourists arrive, they must not be seeing the tired wreckage of a once-great British arts scene. They must be looking with delight at the healthy, vigorous cultural landscape that produced <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2012/jul/28/olympics-2012-danny-boyle\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle's world-beating opening ceremony</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Sexual harassment of women is not new to Egypt. Almost every woman in the country <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7514567.stm\" title=\"\">has experienced some form of harassment</a>, whether verbal or physical.</p> <p>What is new, though, is a slow but steady change in the tide of public opinion. It began with Eid in 2006, where a crowd of women fell prey to sexual predators, some having their clothes ripped off.</p> <p>Until recently, the Arabic word for harassment (<em>tahharush</em>) was not used in this context. It was previously known as <em>muakssa</em> \u2013 implying playful behaviour by young men having a good time. It was simply accepted as part of a \"boys will be boys\" attitude, with women and girls having to embrace it because that's just how boys are.</p> <p>Finally, this social cancer has come to be referred to as \"harassment\" and the media have begun to pay attention rather than turn a blind eye.</p> <p>In 2010 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/678_%28film%29\" title=\"\">an Egyptian film entitled 678</a> began to bring the issue to public attention. The film told the stories of three women from different social classes who were all victims of harassment one way or another.</p> <p>The Eid al-Fitr holiday following this year's Ramadan brought its usual share of sexual harassment, though many of the incidents were photographed and filmed \u2013 and spread like wildfire through Facebook and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrVikzxyop4\" title=\"\">YouTube</a>, raising awareness of the problem and provoking debate.</p> <p>This time, unlike in the past, not everyone dismissed these supposedly \"random incidents\" as a case of marriage-deprived men on the wrong end of capitalism venting their urges on provocative women who were just asking for it.</p> <p>Many of the women harassed were fully dressed in hijabs and full lengths abayas, rendering the \"women are to blame\" excuse redundant for anyone who cares to think. In the hospital where I work, it is not uncommon for female doctors in hijab and baggy scrubs not accentuating a single curve to be verbally harassed.</p> <p>Some people, at least, have come to realise that the problem lies deeper. Since it would seem (as many harassed women report) that the predators are usually from the poorer sections of society, a wider debate on inequality and poverty has been extrapolated from the initial harassment debate.</p> <p>Some have used this observation to explain the social epidemic in economic terms: of poor men venting their feelings of anger, inequality and injustice on the weaker members of a class they hate and envy.</p> <p>But an economic argument doesn't do full justice to the problem, since women of poorer social classes are harassed just as frequently, if not more, than their richer counterparts. Groping on cramped public transport (a small piece of hell that those who own cars do not have to go through every day) is but one example.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/laleltaharosh\" title=\"\">Facebook groups</a> dedicated to combating the issue have been set up, also making their presence tangible with banners on the streets. While they still receive ridicule and disdain, they have certainly forced people to wake up.</p> <p>One major factor is the lack of legal penalties to deter harassers \u2013 though some employers and businesses have taken matters into their own hands.</p> <p>\"In the school where I work, no custodian or gardener would even think of harassing me, even though they belong to lower social classes, because they know that that would mean the end of their jobs. So under the right circumstances, they know very well how to control themselves\", Noha, a 27-year-old English teacher from Alexandria, explains.</p> <p>Noha does not wear the hijab. She dresses in western style clothing and generally leads a western lifestyle. She also goes to clubs to dance. Discos, she says, where gender mixing, dancing and alcohol are in abundance, provide another example of what can be achieved \u2013 given the will. Despite their inebriation, men succeed in controlling themselves because they know that one complaint from a woman means security will throw them out.</p> <p>Similar examples can be seen in the Red Sea resorts of Egypt, where hotel staff, by no means rich, are capable of controlling their behaviour before bikini-clad and sometimes topless women.</p> <p>This has begun to be recognised as one of the perpetuating factors behind the problem. Police on the streets turn a blind eye to such behaviour, sometimes even partaking in it themselves. There's no presence on the streets to deter those who act solely upon their lust and hormones.</p> <p>But now, for the first time, we are seeing such barbaric behaviour condemned forcefully by some of the \"Facebook generation\", describing those who cannot control themselves as animals, depicting them in sarcastic pictures of a pig's head on a man's body with the caption: \"She's dressed like that. She is to blame.\"</p> <p>If lack of punishment is a perpetuating factor, social tolerance of harassment is still the root cause. Noha reports rarely being harassed by men of higher social classes, but that doesn't mean they condemn the behaviour. In fact, many men do not partake in such activities themselves because they see it as \"beneath them\", but still believe the victim is to blame for her harassment because of her manner of dress.</p> <p>Fortunately, people (though too few at present) are beginning to see the folly of blaming the victims. It is no different from blaming a black person for suffering discrimination.</p> <p>Social media and films like 678 have definitely raised awareness. A new generation of Egyptians keen on expressing their opinions and being heard and influenced by concepts such as individual liberties and women's rights are beginning to take action. Slowly but surely, society is beginning a shift in attitude and breaking with the patriarchal attitudes of yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>Birth control was a highly controversial subject whose advocates had braved public abuse and even prosecution. In 1877, for instance <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRbradlaugh.htm\">Charles Bradlaugh</a> and <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wbesant.htm\">Annie Besant</a> were convicted of publishing \"an obscene libel\" for discussing birth control in their book The Fruits of Philosophy and sentenced to six months in prison. The sentence was quashed at the Court of Appeal. Annie then continued to write and lecture about birth control. </p> <p>In 1918 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Stopes\">Marie Stopes </a>wrote a book called <em>Married Love</em>, which included a chapter on birth control . It was a publishing sensation and made her a national figure. She followed this with another book, <em>Wise Parenthood</em>, and opened the first birth control clinic in the country in Holloway, London in March 1921, run by midwives. In 1924 the Society for the Provision of Birth Control Clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics. </p> <p>Charis Frankenburg was doing social work in Salford. She later recalled in her autobiography <em>Not Old, Madam, Vintage </em></p> <blockquote> <p>Having read the books of Dr Marie Stopes and profited by her expertise \u2013 we had four children spaced exactly as intended \u2013 I wrote in the autumn of 1925 to ask her to tell me of someone near Manchester who might be interested in helping me to set up a Birth Control Clinic. She suggested Mrs John Stocks. I recognised her as Mary Brinton whom I had known at St Paul's \u2026On October 23rd, we collected a few friends and formed a committee.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mary was born in 1899 and attended St Paul's school and then the London School of Economics. She married the philosopher, John Stocks, and taught at the LSE and Kings College for Women during the war. They then moved to Oxford where she taught at Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall. In the early 1920s Mary Stocks was joint editor of a feminist publication <em>The Woman's Leader</em> with Eve Hubback. </p> <p>At the end of 1924 her husband was offered a professorship in philosophy at the University of Manchester and the couple moved to the city, taking a house at 22 Wilbraham Road. They were soon drawn into the middle-class cultural life of the city, which revolved around the University, the <em>Manchester Guardian</em> and the University Settlement at the Round House, 20 Every Street, Ancoats, where Mary directed plays, including five she had written herself. </p> <p>Mary became Chair of the Committee, whilst Charis was secretary. After visiting the clinics already established, they enlisted a doctor, Dr Olive Gimson, and two midwives, Sister Pulford and Sister Lloyd. They managed to raise \u00a3190 and used this to rent two rooms over a baker's shop at 161 Greengate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395721048\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2009/7/21/1248176371192/CP-Scott-former-editor-of-005.jpg\" alt=\"CP Scott, former editor of the Manchester Guardian\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">C.P.Scott, the editor of the Manchester Guardian, ensured coverage. Photograph: The Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February 1926 welfare campaigners held a conference on Maternal Mortality in Manchester at which the dangers to women's health of excessive pregnancies were highlighted by a number of speakers. It attracted considerable comment in the press and Charis used the opportunity to write a letter to the <em>Manchester Guardian</em>, published on 13 February, outlining the problems over mortality during child birth. Despite this, the Ministry of Health would not allow doctors at infant welfare centres to give advice on contraception and therefore, she announced, a clinic would soon be opening in Salford which would see married women who had had at least one child \u2013 except at the discretion of the doctor. The charge would normally be a shilling.</p> <p>Even before the clinic opened there were protests, particularly by the Catholic church. In February an article in the local Catholic newspaper the <em>Catholic Federationist</em> attacked the proposed clinic. Noting that the birth rate was the lowest on record the writer commented that:</p> <blockquote> <p>one would imagine that these figures would give pause to the artificial birth controllers, but nothing would stop them in their headlong course. Anyhow, these figures may bring other people to their senses and may teach them that, apart from morality, people who encourage birth control are a threat to the nation.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Manchester, Salford and District Mothers' Clinic for Birth Control opened on 1 March 1926 with clinics twice-weekly, Monday 3-5 and Tuesday 8-9.30. On the first day 19 women attended. The <em>Manchester Guardian </em>reported that:</p> <blockquote> <p>yesterday afternoon a number of poor mothers of varying ages, having generally children with them, were climbing the stairs to the two rooms.</p> </blockquote> <p> On 13 April a protest meeting against the clinic was held in Salford town hall, which was so full that an overflow meeting had to be held outside. The meeting was chaired by Mrs Mary Welch who said that whilst those who advocated birth control might have the very best objects in contemplation, they said poor women should have the same facilities as rich women. But would birth control give them the same facilities and privileges? She was not going to be let it said that children were the cause of poverty. </p> <p>The birth control pioneers held their own public meeting in May at Pendleton town hall, which attracted an audience of 250 and was chaired by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Rathbone\">Eleanor Rathbone.</a> The speakers were Lord Balfour of Burleigh, <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/haire-norman-10390,\">Dr Norman Haire</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Carr-Saunders\">Professor Carr-Saunders </a>and Mary Stocks. Only four people voted against the resolution supporting the clinic and \u00a34 was collected in coppers for its work.</p> <p>Following the meeting Charis wote a letter to the <em>Manchester Guardian </em>on 15 June. She said that, after the report in the newspaper of the meeting in Pendleton, there had been considerable public interest in the work of the clinic, 180 women had already received advice and it was significant that friends of former patients form a large part of the new attendance. She outlined the support that the clinic had received and made an appeal for further donations which could be sent to their treasurer, Mrs Burrows. </p> <p>Reflecting back on their experiences in article published on <em>The Guardian </em>women's page in 1962 , Mary Stocks wrote: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mrs Frankenburg and I were singled out for special obloquy. We were \"the kind of women who visited matinees and sat with cigarettes between their painted lips\". The image was in one respect comforting, for we had envisaged ourselves as rather dowdy social workers. And our clinic was described as being reached through \"a stinking entry\". This was a little hard for the stink was in fact merely the smell of good hot meat pies. But the location of the clinic through the shop made attendance easy for shy mothers \u2013 and they came , the shy and the not so shy</p> </blockquote> <p>In its first annual report the clinic revealed that it had given advice to 423 women and that there had been 319 repeat visits. They had refused to give advice to a number of women deemed unsuitable. (The report does not explain why). Ironically many women had first heard about the clinic because of the protest meeting. Many came expecting to be given abortions and had to be advised that this was illegal and then given appointments for the ante-natal clinic. Whilst most of the women attending the clinic had come from Salford or Manchester, others had come from further afield, even from as far way as Scotland:</p> <blockquote> <p>An increasing number in the past few months has been referred to the clinic by the medical officers of welfare centres. A great majority are the wives of men earning between \u00a32 and \u00a33 a week. A distressingly large proportion are in a very poor state of health\u2026The great majority\u2026 in their desire for family limitation appear to be actuated by economic motives. A profound sense of parental responsibility and the well-being of the existing children actuates their desire to incur no further pregnancies because of inadequate housing and wages. The proved value to health of mother and child is also coming to be generally recognised.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Michael Herbert is a Trustee of the <a href=\"http://www.wcml.org.uk \">Working Class Movement Library</a> and leads walks exploring Manchester's radical history for <a href=\"http://redflagwalks.wordpress.com/\">Red Flag Walks</a>.

  "<p>Mixing J20 and Irn-Bru may not sound very appetising, but that is what the companies behind the two soft drink brands are planning.</p> <p><strong>Britvic</strong>, the J20 owner whose other brands include Fruit Shoots and Tango, has confirmed reports of a proposed all share merger with Scottish Irn-Bru maker <strong>AG Barr</strong>. If the deal goes ahead it would create one of Europe's leading soft drink companies, although Britvic warned discussions were at an early stage. The two have agreed that Britvic shareholders would own 63% of the enlarged company, with AG Barr investors accounting for the rest.</p> <p>Barr's chief executive Roger White would take that position in the enlarged group, with Britvic chairman Gerald Corbett keeping his role.</p> <p>Both companies had suffered from the poor weather earlier in the summer, with Barr warning at the end of July that interim profits would be below the previous year's level.</p> <p>Britvic also left itself vulnerable to a bid following the \u00a325m hit to profits from recalling Fruit Shoots after a design fault in the caps.</p> <p>Wayne Brown at Canaccord Genuity said he believed the merger discussions could already be well advanced, despite the statement's caution:</p> <blockquote> We would also assume (not confirmed by either party) that with PepsiCo's change of control clause within its bottling contract with Britvic, that they have agreed to the proposals laid out today. This would remove the largest risk the merger. </blockquote> <p>He said the merger terms suggested a price of 350p per Britvic share, and said the company was now firmly in play.</p> <p>In the market, Britvic has jumped 28.4p to 357p while Barr is 7.9p better at 423.5p.</p> <p>At the current share prices Britvic is valued at \u00a3863m, Barr at \u00a3494m and the combined group at nearly \u00a31.4bn.</p> <p>Given Britvic is above Brown's 350p target, the market seems to be entertaining the possibility of a rival bid, with the likes of Diageo mentioned as possible predators in the past.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics-2012\" title=\"\">London Paralympics</a> has not only succeeded in getting out a mass message, with 21st-century skill, that disabled people can be sexy, exciting, achievers and media stars. It has also highlighted protests that have made many more people aware of some of the worst contradictions surrounding disability. These include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2012/aug/31/disabled-protest-atos-paralympics-video\" title=\"\">the acceptance of Atos</a> as a Paralympics sponsor at the same time as its heavily flawed assessment procedures are terrorising thousands of disabled people and the arbitrary <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18785219\" title=\"\">closure of Remploy factories</a> in the name of inclusion, when more and more disabled people are being excluded from mainstream employment.</p> <p>Both messages may fade as the thrill of the Games recedes. But the UK's changing demographics resulting in the presence of many more disabled people of working age and beyond are likely to have a more enduring legacy.</p> <p>Currently, as can be seen with government welfare reform, the default position for public policy seems to be to treat disabled people as a powerless group to be safely stigmatised, segregated and wheeled on to be scapegoated at difficult times. But the days of such attitudes are likely to be numbered, as disabled people, helped by the Paralympics, emerge as a more substantial, assertive and self-conscious minority.</p> <p>Sadly, hostility towards disabled people is not confined to politicians and press; both can still count on at least some public support. What isn't clear is whether such populist prejudice is rooted in perceptions of people making false claims to be disabled, or enduring negative stereotypes of disabled people as dependent, unproductive and parasitic. Whichever, the message reaching many disabled people is still that they might be better off dead, or not born in the first place. Women seen as at risk of having disabled children are routinely tested to avoid giving birth. Disabled people in hospital and their families <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/dec/05/nhs-hospitals-warned-resuscitate-orders\" title=\"\">live in fear</a> of \"do not resuscitate\" orders being used discriminatorily to end their lives. Many fear that the rush for new assisted dying legislation will put more pressure on them \"not to be a burden\", serving as an alternative to ensuring them and their families adequate support.</p> <p>If policymakers are to catch up with the vibe of the Paralympics then they must listen to the rising voices of disabled people themselves \u2013 starting with employment, since it has become the defining issue for attacking them. The wide range of disabled people, people with physical and sensory impairments, mental health service users, people with learning difficulties and chronic and life-limiting conditions all experience disproportionately high rates of poverty, exclusion from and marginalisation in employment. This says much more about public policy than could any individual qualities or characteristics they share. Instead of seeing employment as an obligation disabled people flunk, policymakers must start seeing it as a right they are denying them.</p> <p>Helping disabled people access employment means mainstreaming real programmes&#xa0;of training and support for them, rather than the present rhetoric of \"re-ablement\" and the incompetent schemes of current big private-sector suppliers. It means advancing flexible and inclusive employment through effective and properly policed anti-discrimination legislation. It also means renewed commitments to make higher education more rather than less inclusive of disabled people.</p> <p>But employment must not be the be-all and end-all. Other forms of contribution and occupation need to be valued and supported for disabled people so that they can set up house, have relationships, partners and families, on equal terms with non-disabled people, rather than being kept segregated in \"services\".</p> <p>Disabled people have proved that with proper support, they can live full lives alongside the rest of us. Government must bite the bullet and invest in a sustainable system of social care. This means developing the kind of anti-institutionalising, peer-support and user-led services successfully developed by disabled people and their organisations, giving thousands of disabled people greater control over their lives.</p> <p>This user-led approach must be brought from the margins into the mainstream, in a market increasingly dominated instead by large-scale, multinational, profit-driven private equity companies perpetuating the same old welfare approaches.</p> <p>Such user-led support services also provide a valuable source of social and economic development and employment for disabled people. To make this happen, government must advance the network of local \"disabled people's organisations\" (DPOs), that have long been promised but still not delivered, to replace the top-heavy, often paternalistic traditional charities that still predominate.</p> <p>Prejudice and discrimination against disabled people are only truly likely to be dealt with, though, when we all grow up together. Our separation through segregated education continues to create personal and social barriers \u2013 from bullying to hate crime. A commitment to inclusive education which safeguards our rights and needs as disabled and non-disabled people is probably the single most important step to enabling us all to acknowledge and advance our abilities and potential \u2013 in true Olympic spirit.</p>",

It may pass laws inimical to the journalistic and commercial imperatives of the press, or choose not to enforce them in grey areas. </p> <p>The Guardian newspaper would not exist today if the Labour chancellor Denis Healey had not agreed to reject a treasury tax law that would have penalised the Scott Trust. How far was that decision influenced by the friendly attitude of The Guardian during the years in which Alastair Hetherington was editor? </p> <p>Would BSkyB exist in its present form had Margaret Thatcher not overruled her home secretary, so enabling Rupert Murdoch to gain a foothold in broadcasting and compete with the BBC for sports licences? </p> <p>How far did the campaigns against the BBC of the Murdochs, father and son, influence the new prime minister, David Cameron, in cutting the BBC revenues?</p> <p>As an editor, my own conflicts with political authority were not sought out of any hostility to government, business or the civil service, but stemmed from the conviction that the public interest was rarely well served by the general bureaucratic tendency to discretion rather than disclosure. </p> <h2>The influence of proprietors</h2> <p>By and large, the day-to-day relationships of reporter and politician are good. Journalists who betray confidences and politicians who deceive pay dearly. Bargains are struck all the time. </p> <p>Journalists are often willing to delay the first intimation of a news break in return for an understanding that the restraint will be rewarded by a fuller briefing that is denied competitors, or an exclusive television interview. </p> <p>From the politicians' side, the understanding, typically implicit, is that news will be presented in a fair, even favourable, context. Reporters are not normally able to offer any further inducements.</p> <p>Editors, on the other hand, have been known to change a newspaper's editorial line overnight in deference to a political leader's sense of national priorities.</p> <p>Complicating these generalisations is the influence of the proprietor, the relationship of the proprietor with politicians, and the working out of different perspectives between proprietor, editor and senior staff engaged in political discourse.</p> <p>One has constantly to remember that for all the talk of \"the press', newspapers, broadcasters and bloggers, can claim no greater right than the right of any other citizen, though sometimes they sound as though they do \u2013 particularly on the internet. </p> <p>Cyber communication has as much a duty to refrain from malicious libel, hate speech, and the like, as the regular press and should be treated accordingly. While the rights of the press are no more or less than those of the private citizen, the press is equipped to exercise the rights of collection and dissemination on a wide scale. </p> <p>In the selection (or suppression) of information it is free to emphasise the negative or the positive, free to comment and to investigate. Great public benefit may accrue from a newspaper's persistence in an investigation. </p> <p>Obvious examples in our time are the hacking scandal (Guardian), the revelations of MPs' expenses (Daily Telegraph), the thalidomide disaster (Sunday Times), and from the popular press I would single out the Daily Mail's determination that the killers of Stephen Lawrence would not get away with murder.</p> <p>Investigations I instigated from 1961-1981 at the Northern Echo, the Sunday Times and The Times were by the normal procedures of asking questions and seeking documentation. There was no email and no mobile phones. It is worth noting two occasions when surreptitious wireless recordings were approved.</p> <h2>The right reason for covert recording</h2> <p>The consent of the editor or very senior executive was required for any such activity and approved only where it was considered proper. Approval was given for wire recording to prove illegal deal-rigging in the antiques industry. </p> <p>The Times in 1967, under the editorship of William Rees-Mogg, had prima facie evidence of corruption in the Metropolitan police force but the person who was willing to give direct oral evidence was a petty criminal. The editor judged it ethically questionable and legally risky to rely on him. </p> <p>The only way the allegations could be tested was by having corroborative evidence. It was impossible to place a reporter in a position to hear the relevant discussions. A wire recording of the corrupt policeman in action was the only way of obtaining admissible evidence. I would have approved, as Rees-Mogg did.</p> <p>During my own editing, my rule of thumb in deciding the ethics of any such activity was always that we must openly declare how we got the information. No such principle was observed by the hackers employed by News International.</p> <p>The very thought that they had to conceal what they were doing ought to have given pause to someone in the long series of crimes that became routine. That ethical atmosphere was conducive to more wrongdoing. A culture of corruption prevailed. </p> <p>That is not necessarily a consequence of a concentration of ownership. Media groups may be more scrupulously conducted than News International. And I well know there are economic benefits in sharing resources and revenues, especially during these difficult days when newspaper audiences and revenues face such competition from the internet.</p> <p>It has always struck me as bizarre that while exposure of truths undeniably in the public interest have faced many hurdles, exposure of hurtful truths about private lives have had a free run though they rarely have any redeeming social value.</p> <p>The dynamics of political authority and the press are well illustrated by the fate of the report by Sir David Calcutt on privacy in 1990. He said the press should be given \"one final chance\" to demonstrate that self-regulation could work \u2013 adopting the phrase of the harried home secretary David Mellor that the press was drinking at the last chance saloon. </p> <p>Well, it got drunk again and again, but political authority was as benevolent as the country bobby helping a familiar tippler to find his way home. I advised that if self-regulation was not effective a statutory system should be crafted. It wasn't so crafted because the government of the day feared to antagonise the tabloids.</p> <h2>Privacy and investigative journalism</h2> <p>Privacy is admittedly a difficult issue. Privacy for me, but not for you if you prey on public trust. The requirement for the press is to honour the individual but maintain the freedom and independence to monitor the conduct of public affairs which means having freedom from laws misapplied to protect government from embarrassment, freedom from corrupt alliances with politicians with vested interests, freedom against the pressures of powerful corporations, national and foreign, freedom against the abuse of freedom by semi-monopolistic controllers of the press.</p> <p>It was frankly alarming when members of the Younger committee on privacy [which reported to parliament in 1972] exhibited no understanding of the nature of real investigative journalism. </p> <p>They did not realise that many inquiries would be stopped dead in their tracks before publication. Some on the committee felt that things could be left to the police and official departments. </p> <p>Of the scores of examples we [at the Sunday Times] could have given, we cited fraud by operators of franchises. The fraudsters claimed their privacy had been invaded by our asking questions. </p> <p>The police were as aware as we were that the best way to stop the rackets was to publicise them before the crooks got away with the money. But the police told us they could not act without a specific complaint and few were forthcoming though the rackets were widespread.</p> <p>Simple reason: victims did not wish to admit publicly that they had been had. Secondly, there were simply not enough policemen to monitor the franchise jungle \u2013 and there was nobody coordinating operations country side. </p> <p>Sometimes a fraud squad man would actually steer our reporters to a case, partly to gain information and partly because the operation was either within the letter of the law or any \"fraudulent inducements\" are made verbally and never put in writing. </p> <p>The privacy committee did not realise that a newspaper could act as a megaphone caveat emptor \u2013 warning thousands and millions of people who could not be protected by a single prosecution of a single individual.</p> <p><strong><em>Tomorrow:</em></strong> Harry Evans warns that, despite the outrage over hacking, it is important not to enact laws that might impede legitimate journalism</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, will be published by Abramis on 17 September</p>",
  "<p>The FBI has denied claims by a hacking group that says it obtained details of more than 12m Apple IDs from the laptop of a federal agent.</p> <p>The group, called AntiSec, said it found 12.36m IDs on the laptop and was making some details public in order to draw attention the the FBI's activities. </p> <p>In a statement, the group predicted the FBI would deny the breach. \"Seems quite clear nobody pays attention if you just come and say 'Hey, FBI is using your device details and info and who the fuck knows what the hell are they experimenting with that,' well sorry, but nobody will care. FBI will, as usual, deny or ignore this uncomfortable thingie and everybody will forget the whole thing at amazing speed.\"</p> <p>The group said it believed the FBI was using the IDs to track people.</p> <p>The FBI released a statement late on Monday, which said: \"The FBI is aware of published reports alleging that an FBI laptop was compromised and private data regarding Apple UDIDs was exposed. At this time there is no evidence indicating that an FBI laptop was compromised or that the FBI either sought or obtained this data.\"</p> <p>Apple did not return calls for comment.</p> <p>According to the group the UDIDs (unique device IDs) were stored in a file named NCFTA_iOS_devices_intel.csv. NCFTA stands for National Cyber-Forensics &amp; Training Alliance and is an alliance between businesses, academics and law enforcements aimed at cracking down on cybercrime.</p> <p>Marco Arment, creator of the Instapaper app, <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2012/09/04/fbi-udid-leak\">said in a blogpost</a> that the information could have come from an app and not necessarily from Apple.</p> <p>\"All of this information could have been collected from an app transmitting data to a server. For instance, this is exactly the information that an ad network would want to collect. And in order to get stats from 12 million devices, it would probably need to be from a set of popular, free apps \u2026 where you'd probably see ads,\" he wrote.</p>",

They lambasted Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, over healthcare, abortion, equal pay, same sex marriage and offshore bank accounts.</p> <p>At one point Stacy Lihn, whose toddler daughter Zoe has congenital heart disease, told the crowd how Obama's healthcare legislation had secured life-saving treatment for her child. \"Obamacare provides my family security and relief,\" said Linh as she attacked Romney for pledging to repeal the reforms.</p> <p>Michelle Obama used her primetime speech to pull together many of these themes. The thrust was personal, talking about her early life with Obama, her reluctance to spoil that by him running for the White House and, in the end, her relief that he had not been changed by the experience but made stronger.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"Being president does not change who you are: it reveals who you are,\" she said.</p> <p>She acknowledged that it had been tough for him at the White House, with many struggles that had tested him. But he had done what was right, influenced by the disparity that he seen growing up, particularly the treatment of his mother, repeatedly passed over for promotion because she was a woman. That was why the first piece of legislation he passed was equal pay for women.</p> <p>He also ignored people who said he should leave health reform to another president, doing it because he thought it was right. \"No one in this country should ever go broke because of an accident or illness,\" she declared.&#xa0;</p> <p>At times the speech was sentimental, particularly when she said she loved her husband more now than four years ago, and her declaration that the most important thing in her life was being \"mom-in-chief\".</p> <p>In a theme that will be heard over and over again through over the next few days, she returned repeatedly to the issue of opportunity.&#xa0;\"Barack knows what it means when a family struggles, he knows what it means to want something more for your kids and grandkids,\" she said. \"Barack knows the American dream because he's lived it, and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"</p> <p>In the battle of the spouses this will go down as a win for the Obamas, with the first lady's delivery crisper and her speech better written than Ann Romney's last week.</p> <p>One delegate, Jim Hussey, a retired electrician form Delaware, said: \"I thought it hit all the right parts. It was a little sentimental but I understand why: she loves her husband and family.\" &#xa0;Overall he thought the point she was putting across was one of fairness and equal opportunity.</p> <p>As a first lady rather than an elected politician she carefully avoided making any overt attacks on Obama's Republican opponent, Mitt Romney. But plenty of other speakers did.</p> <p>The other main speaker of the evening was Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, Texas, a rising star of the party who filled the same keynote speaking slot that catapulted Barack Obama to prominence at the 2004 convention.&#xa0;</p> <p>He set out the ideological differences between the Democrats and Republicans over the role of the federal government and the part it plays in the economy.</p> <p>While the Republicans favour lower taxes and slashing regulation to ignite the economy, the Democrats argue in favour of higher taxes on the wealthy to help lift up the working class. \"We all understand that freedom isn't free,\" Castro said. \"What Romney and [Paul] Ryan don't understand is that neither is opportunity. We have to invest in it.\"</p> <p>In one of the most memorable lines of the night, Castro said: \"In the end the American dream is not a sprint, or even a marathon, but a relay. Our families don't always cross the finish line in the span of one generation. But each generation passes on to the next the fruits of their labour.\"</p> <p>The carefully orchestrated opening day combined a defence of Obama's record with vague hints of what he might do if he wins a second term. &#xa0;But there was also a lot of the negative campaigning that has worked well for the Obama team so far, bashing Romney</p> <p>One of the biggest crowd-pleasers was the former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, who, in &#xa0;a punchy speech, accusing the Republican of lacking economic patriotism. \"Barack Obama is betting on the American worker. Mitt Romney is betting on a Bermuda shell corporation,\" Strickland said.</p> <p>The Chicago mayor, Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former White House chief of staff, said there was a lot at stake in November's election.&#xa0;\"Each crisis was so deep and so dangerous; any one of them would have defined another presidency,\" Emanuel said. \"We faced a once-in-a-generation moment in American history. Fortunately for all of us, we have a once-in-a-generation president.\"</p> <p>One of the standout speeches of the night was Lily Ledbetter, champion of equal pay for women, who took Goodyear to court after discovering she was being paid less than her male counterparts. She said a few cents might not matter much to Mitt Romney with his tax havens but it did to her. &#xa0;</p> <p>The first bill Obama signed into law in 2009 was one inspired by Ledbetter. \"It is about women. About equality. About justice,\" she told delegates.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What do you hope to achieve in your new role at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.rsm.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Royal Society of Medicine</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>I have four immediate priorities. First, I must maintain the RSM's special position in medicine as a centre for education and scholarship both in the UK and globally. The society has members in 92 countries and I need to ensure that all their interests are protected.</p> <p>Second, to nurture two of the RSM's more recent activities \u2013 encouragement of innovation and support for global health \u2013 which are both so important for all our members.</p> <p>Third, I need to broaden our activities to encompass disciplines critical to modern healthcare including pharmacy, biostatistics and health economics but about which doctors know so little.</p> <p>And finally I will seek to do more for the next generation of healthcare professionals so that they are able to take full advantage of the opportunities available to them in the future.</p> <p><strong>Why is it important that RSM engages better with statisticians and health economists? </strong></p> <p>Statistics and health economics are now playing a much greater role in medicine than ever before. But too few of my clinical colleagues understand what these disciplines have contributed in the past, and will continue to contribute, in the future. We need to embrace the disciplines they represent if we are to avoid the tribalism of the past.</p> <p><strong>What challenges are facing the society over the next few years?</strong></p> <p>The RSM has been in existence for 200 years. Its importance and relevance have increased, exponentially, during that time. If the society is to continue to evolve with the changing global demands on healthcare systems, it must recognise and promote both new and emerging technologies as well as the changing patterns of healthcare delivery.</p> <p><strong>What areas could be greatly improved when it comes to education and training for healthcare professionals?</strong></p> <p>All healthcare professionals need to understand the nature of the evidence that underpins \"evidence-based medicine\". Too few clinicians appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of our current techniques; far too few have any idea what terms like \"odds ratios\", \"relative risks\" and \"hazard ratios\" really mean; and too many believe that statistical probability tests distinguish \"truth\" and \"falsehood\".</p> <p>All young healthcare professionals, irrespective of whether they eventually undertake research themselves, need to know how to understand what really constitutes \"evidence\" if they are to practice their profession, to the highest standards, in an ever-changing world.</p> <p><strong>If you could pass one new piece of healthcare policy, what would it be?</strong></p> <p>I would arrange for all citizens of the UK to have electronic healthcare records that are fully integrated with decision-support tools based on Nice's clinical guidelines.</p> <p><strong>You were chair of Nice for over a decade \u2013 how challenging was it to deal with the numerous controversies around drugs approvals?</strong></p> <p>Of course Nice regrets saying no to a particular new pharmaceutical product. Nevertheless, if a product doesn't give value for money, its use in the NHS would deprive other people \u2013 with other conditions \u2013 of cost-effective care. Patients, the professions and the public largely understand, this despite the activities of some sections of the media.</p> <p><strong>What impact do you think health reforms will have on the work of Nice and the RSM?</strong></p> <p>As far as Nice is concerned, the Health and Social Care Act, if anything, increases the relevance of the institute's work to the NHS and re-establishes it under primary (as opposed to secondary) legislation. The new act increases the pressure on the RSM to enhance its educational role so that the quality of care given to patients continuously improves.</p> <p><strong>What has been your greatest professional achievement?</strong></p> <p>Being appointed chair-designate of Nice in 1998, at a time when there was no staff, no premises and no money \u2013 and being allowed to continue in the role for nearly 14 years \u2013 has been the most exhilarating part of my professional life so far. We now have a staff of over 500 people; offices in London, Manchester and Liverpool; and an annual budget of over \u00a365m a year. None of this would have been possible, though, without a committed board and a wonderful staff led by the incomparable Andrew Dillon [<a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/aboutnice/whoweare/board/executivedirectors/sirandrewdillon.jsp\" title=\"\">Nice's founding chief executive</a>].</p> <p><strong>You became professor of clinical pharmacology at 32 \u2013 are you a natural high achiever?</strong></p> <p>No, I'm not. And I have certainly never planned my career. Rather I have \"drifted\", taking opportunities as they arise. I've just been lucky!</p> <p><strong>What's your leadership style and how has it developed?</strong></p> <p>I'm not sure I really know what \"leadership\" is. What I have done, though, is to try to enthuse colleagues and staff about what we're trying to do; explain why it is so important and give praise and credit where it's due. And when things go wrong \u2013 as they inevitably will from time to time \u2013 try to learn from mistakes.</p> <p><strong>If you could take three things to a desert island, what would they be?</strong></p> <p>My harpsichord (which I built from a kit), my laptop (plus solar panel and a 3G receiver) and a copy of Principia Mathematica because, with so much time on my hands, I might at last be able to read and understand it.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Women make up fewer than one in ten (7.3%) of directors of FTSE 250 companies and black and ethnic minorities account for only 4.1% of directors in the FTSE 100, according to a report from <a href=\"http://www.equality-ne.co.uk/downloads/582_boardroom-diverstiy.pdf\" title=\"\">the Government Equalities Office</a>.</p> <p>Social enterprises, however, are performing substantially better: 86% of them had leadership teams with at least one female director, and 27% had directors from ethnic minorities, <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/uploads/editor/files/Publications/Fightback_Britain.pdf\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise UK </a>found.</p> <p>As business models, social enterprises are inarguably more representative of the population than traditional businesses. But some in the sector warn that unless action is taken to promote the model, this could quickly change.</p> <p>Lucy Patterson founded <a href=\"http://jcsp.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Jigsaw Care Services Plus</a> in June 2011 with her business partner Lorraine Clements. A social enterprise, it provides personal assistants for families of disabled children. Rather than employing assistants directly, it acts as a recruitment service for families who pay them directly via personal budgets.</p> <p>\"We find that we come across a lot more female-led social enterprises\", says Patterson. \"We'd both worked in the care sector for a long time, had relatively successful careers, and wanted to do something that would put food on our table and pay our bills but also gives back at the same time. It's not been about making money. I think a lot of the time, within a male environment, it is very much about status, whereas in a female environment it is different.\"</p> <p>While this may be anecdotal, there is plenty of quantitative data to show that social enterprises appeal to a broader cross-section of entrepreneurs than simply white males. <a href=\"http:// www.unltd.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UnLtd</a>, the charity that supports social entrepreneurs, reports that, of the start-ups it supports, 53% are male to 47% female, 68% white to 18% black or black British, 9% Asian or Asian British and 5% from mixed or multiple ethnic groups.</p> <p>At more than 30% black and ethnic minority, it is if anything overly representative for a country where such groups make up less than 10% of the population. Similarly at the School for Social Entrepreneurs, between 2007-2011, 21% of its students came from an ethnic minority background; in London, that rises to 32%.</p> <p>Part of the reason is that social enterprises are not evenly distributed across the country. They tend to cluster in urban areas, and particularly in areas of social deprivation. \"Communities who face challenge, prejudice and lack of fairness are forced to take matters into their own hands\", suggests David McGlashan, enterprise officer at the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">School for Social Entrepreneurs</a>, \"and social enterprise presents a model which allows communities to tackle inequality, with the primary aim being social impact, not financial return.\"</p> <p>Nick Temple, director of business and enterprise at Social Enterprise UK, says: \"We should acknowledge that social enterprises are doing a hell of a lot better [than the wider business world] ... I think what it partly reflects is where they're based: roughly 40% of social enterprises are based in the 20% most deprived areas \u2013 it's about three times the proportion than standard businesses in those areas. That tends to mean they are based in more diverse communities as well\".</p> <p>Added to that, he says, \"The flexibility, the way social enterprises operate and the ethical value they have makes them more attractive to a more diverse range of people.\"</p> <p>However, a recent academic paper from the <a href=\"http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/ceedr\" title=\"\">Centre for Enterprise and Economic Development Research</a> paints a less rosy picture. Research into emerging ethnic minority social enterprises in the five east London Olympic boroughs uncovered a significant level of distrust towards the social enterprise model. \"There were a lot of businesses that could be deemed as social enterprises who were actually not using that label,\" says co-author Professor Stephen Syrett, \"it wasn't a label that they were comfortable with. This included voluntary and community organisations that were actually trading.\"</p> <p>The term \"social enterprises\" was largely seen, he says, as being linked to a government policy to cut social and charitable ventures away from state grants and support. It's a point that McGlashan also picks up on. \"There is a concern that lack of available public funding will restrict access to \"big society\" opportunities: during periods of economic downturn, opportunities often become accessible only to the well connected, well educated elite ... The sector as a whole would benefit from a clearer identity, similar to the identity that the Fair Trade movement has created. This would give the general public a better understanding of what social enterprise actually means.\"</p> <p>Temple agrees that it's far from job done in terms of promoting the model to female and black and ethnic minority entrepreneurs. \"We've got a job as the national body to continue to promote our leaders as role models, because we have some amazing ones: Penny Newman at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/mar/09/food.business\" title=\"\">CafeDirect</a>, Sophi Tranchell at <a href=\"http://www.divinechocolate.com/about/inside-divine.aspx\" title=\"\">Divine Chocolate</a>, Karen Lynch at <a href=\"http://www.belu.org/archives/952\" title=\"\">Belu</a>, Victor Adebowale at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/social-care-network/2012/jun/01/day-life-victor-adebowale\" title=\"\">Turning Point</a> or Edwin Broni-Mensah who runs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/mar/06/young-british-entrepreneurs\" title=\"\">Give Me Tap</a>. I could go on at length. And without pigeon-holing and badging people, we need to make sure we continue to promote those individuals who demonstrate what's possible ... there's a lot more that we can do still.\"</p> <p>There are numerous support programmes to find and nurture the next generation of diverse leadership in the sector. Katharine Danton, UnLtd's director of research, impact &amp; policy, offers the example of UnLtd's community entrepreneurship programme <a href=\"http://www.unltd.org.uk/template.php?ID=221&amp;PageName=unltdstarpeople\" title=\"\">Star People</a>, \"which looks to scout out, fund and support talented individuals and groups who are working to make their local area a better place to live\". Part of the wider Big Local initiative, it's a 10-year multi-million pound programme that focuses on 150 areas across England. Such schemes, it could be argued, are central to social enterprises having as diverse a future as they do at present.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>After nine months of shadow-boxing and manoeuvring, it seems that the two governments in Edinburgh and London are on the verge of a deal on staging the independence referendum. </p> <p>Both sides confirm that deal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/alex-salmond-pm-scottish-independence-referendum\">could well be sealed</a> by early October, in the midst of party conference season, and it seems both sides can claim some form of victory. </p> <p>Alex Salmond and David Cameron can each claim to have delivered the single question referendum they wanted; notwithstanding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/09/scotland-independence-alex-salmond\">the first minister's openness</a> to a multi-option poll and private manoeuvring to promote one. </p> <p>Salmond can boast that it will include votes for 16 and 17 year olds \u2013 a significant British first. Equally, he has a poll being designed and run by a Scottish parliament.</p> <p>Cameron will be delighted Salmond has conceded that the referendum needs legal validation through a Section 30 order under the Scotland Act in the Westminster parliament, and by the privy council. To hit Salmond's own timetable, they need to act fast, getting that measure enacted in both parliaments by next February.</p> <p>Cameron can crow he has forced Salmond into accepting the referendum question will be assessed and the poll policed by the UK Electoral Commission: the first minister originally insisted he would have a new homemade electoral commission to do that job.</p> <p>But these bragging rights about process and mechanics are, in reality, largely irrelevant to the large majority of voters. </p> <p>Salmond knows this, he also knows the pressure is on him and his party, not on his opponents. He will want to go to the SNP's <a href=\" http://www.snp.org/conference/snp-conference-18-21-october-perth\">Perth conference in mid-October</a> to steel the party's spine and stoke up its desire for the biggest campaign of his and its history: the referendum campaign.</p> <p>That conference will take place just 24 months before the expected referendum date (the Scottish government has mooted 14 October 2014 as one distinct possibility): there's a good campaigning hook there too. </p> <p>All the evidence is that Salmond has already dropped any thought of a two-question referendum, where he would offer sceptical voters a fall-back option of greater devolution on the voting form alongside his carefully calibrated, soft-edged \"lite\" version of independence. That point may have been reached some months ago.</p> <p>Salmond's originally wondered whether civic Scotland, or some well-healed business leader, might fund and lead a pro-devolution campaign for 2014 have evaporated. Remember that in October last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/09/scotland-independence-alex-salmond\">he told the Guardian </a>that putting a second question forward in 2014 was \"a very popular option\":</p> <blockquote> <p>I think there's a case for that. The case is essentially a democratic case. There's plenty of evidence this is a very popular option. Unfortunately no other political party is pursuing this option. [But] it doesn't have to be the policy of a political party to be legitimate.</p> </blockquote> <p>But since then, and equally significantly, resistance to a multi-option or two question vote has hardened within the party, the wider pro-independence movement and the Scottish cabinet. That was made clear in one <a href=\"http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2012/09/03/question-time-2/\">recent Bella Caledonia blog</a>.</p> <p>Faced with most opinion polls still showing <a href=\"http://lallandspeatworrier.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/westminster-independence-that-fabian.html\">a wide gap in support</a> for independence versus the current devolved settlement \u2013 a gap which <a href=\" http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9341474/Support-for-Scottish-independence-falls-after-SNP-launch-breakaway-drive.html\">some polls show </a>is widening \u2013 the SNP cannot afford any further delays or uncertainty. </p> <p>To have a realistic hope of closing that gap, and \u2013 most crucially of all \u2013 building further support up into a vital and necessary lead in the polls to take into referendum day, Yes Scotland needs all the time and space it can get. </p> <p>Its opponents are marshalling their troops: as<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/alex-salmond-pm-scottish-independence-referendum\"> Salmond confirmed at Holyrood</a> on Tuesday that he expected to conclude the deal with Cameron \"within weeks\", the Telegraph was reporting that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9519779/Campaign-to-stop-Alex-Salmond-breaking-up-the-UK-attracts-mass-influx-of-funding-and-support.html\">nearly 50,000 Tory supporters</a> and activists (the actual figure is about 45,000) had committed to supporting the Conservative \"Friends of the Union\" campaign. That is nearly double the SNP's membership.</p> <p>With the announcement on Sunday that the pro-independence campaign Yes Scotland now has <a href=\"http://www.yesscotland.net/yes_scotland_unveils_top_team \">its full executive team in place</a> \u2013 all credible figures, most of whom have no SNP connections - Salmond ought to sound the gun as quickly as he can. Perhaps Blair Jenkins, the Yes Scotland chief executive, has gently made this clear to the first minister. </p> <p>Equally, Salmond and his team have their own solution to narrowing that gap: their \"indy lite\" version of independence is being carefully calibrated to be so \"middle Scotland\" and moderate, it will be much closer to devolution max than fully leaded independence. </p> <p>So this explains why, in the last 72 hours, officials in the UK government detect a noticeable change in the atmosphere in their dealings with St Andrew's House: there is the strengthening suggestion that a deal is ready to be struck. </p> <p>Salmond's officials are using language too which illustrates there is now only a few minor fixes in the way of a final deal on the shape and terms of the referendum, and a meeting between Salmond and Cameron. </p> <p>Each side is making tactical concessions: Salmond's people now say that meeting Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, to nail down the details before meeting Cameron \"presents no obstacle\" for the first minister. This is a climb-down too. Before the recess, Salmond's view was that a leader of his status should only meet Cameron \u2013 they are the \"principle decision-makers\" after all, say Salmond's officials.</p> <p>Equally, with the dispute over scrapping the SNP's opposition to Nato membership <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/snp-leaders-hit-back-at-critics-of-nato-u-turn-plan.18679151\">already splitting the party</a> \u2013 to the extent that as many as a dozen of his backbench MSPs are now openly rebelling, Salmond cannot go into the Perth conference fighting two divisive, wounding battles with his own activist base and his parliamentary party. </p> <p>He and the party's leadership is already committed to insisting on Nato membership \u2013 a significant policy u-turn which most clearly illustrates Salmond's determination to offer the electorate the most middle-ground, softest version of independence the party can stomach.<br> With so much at stake, simultaneously fighting a parallel battle over putting a second question on the ballot paper would, quite clearly, be a damaging and wasteful own goal. And time is precious.</p> <p>Addressing the Perth conference with a deal with the British prime minister on that referendum safely in his back pocket is an historic moment Salmond knows not to ruin. </p> <p>In fact, if I were a bookmaker, I would be very careful about taking bets on Salmond announcing the referendum date when he stands up at the Perth concert hall in a little over six weeks time.</p>",
  "<p>Thomas Brocklehurst, a Victorian banker who lived at Henbury Park in Cheshire, has a lot to answer for. In 1876, he decided to release into the wild a pair of grey squirrels he had brought back with him from a business trip to America. Other landowners, viewing the non-native species as a fashionable garden novelty, soon followed suit.</p> <p>More than a century later, up to 5 million greys are now estimated to inhabit much of the woodland across the UK. But their success as an \"alien\" species has been to the great detriment of the native red squirrel, say conservationists. If the population of greys is not urgently and radically reduced, they say, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/sep/25/british-mammals-red-squirrel-extinction\" title=\"\">then the reds will be driven to extinction in the UK within 20 years</a>. There are an estimated 120,000-140,000 reds in the UK, with 75% of the population in Scotland.</p> <p>\"If you want reds, you have to kill greys. It's a fact,\" says Natasha Collings, project co-ordinator for the <a href=\"http://www.cornwallredsquirrels.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cornwall Red Squirrel Project</a> , a scheme aiming to reintroduce captive-bred reds back into the county over the next five years.</p> <p>Standing beside the caged squirrel enclosure at <a href=\"http://www.trewithengardens.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">Trewithen House</a> near Truro, she explains why the two species cannot live together harmoniously: \"Greys don't actually kill reds themselves, as is commonly believed. They spread a deadly pox, causing distinctive ulcerations on their eyes and nose, which kills reds within five to seven days.\"</p> <p>Greys are destructive in other ways, too, says Collings. \"They are causing about \u00a350m a year's worth of damage to commercial forestry across the UK and incalculable damage to ancient woodlands. They take the tops off trees and will also 'ring bark' the trunks, whereby they strip the bark away which ultimately kills the tree. They also eat bird eggs.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, the <a href=\"http://www.gwct.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust</a> <a href=\"http://www.gwct.org.uk/about_us/news/3487.asp\" title=\"\">published research</a> that claimed that greys are having a \"significant effect on certain woodland birds' fledging success\", particularly species such as the great tit, nuthatch, chaffinch and blackbird.</p> <p>Prince Charles, the patron of the <a href=\"http://www.rsst.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Red Squirrel Survival Trust</a> who has led efforts to see reds reintroduced into Cornwall, formally opened the enclosure at Trewithen earlier this summer. He released a buck that joined the two sisters already settled inside and it is hoped that the breeding trio will soon add to the \"national stud book\" of reds that is used by conservationists to ensure a healthy genetic pool of captive-bred reds. Reds have also been bred for release over the past 16 years at <a href=\"http://www.paradisepark.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Paradise Park</a> wildlife sanctuary in Hayle, west Cornwall.</p> <p>The project in Cornwall aims to create two grey-free <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iSDDJzNUlQ\" title=\"\">exclusion zones in west Cornwall</a> - one on the Lizard, the other in West Penwith - which are then further protected by buffer zones. All greys will be systematically culled within the zones with poisoned bait and landowners will then work to protect those zones by policing the buffer zones. Only then will the captive-bred reds be released.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395469078\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/8/30/1346350684102/Cornwall-Red-Squirrel-Pro-003.jpg\" alt=\"Cornwall Red Squirrel Project at Trewithin Gardens, Project Coordinator Natasha Collings\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natasha Collings, project coordinator for the Cornwall Red Squirrel Project. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: apexnewspix.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Collings says Cornwall was chosen for the \"feasibility study\" because of the county's geography - a long, thin peninsula which enables any grey-free zones in the far west to be more easily defended than in, say, a landlocked county. If successful, the extent of the zones will continue to push east across the rest of the county and into Devon. Other geographically amenable places being considered for similar schemes include the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, and the Gower peninsula in south Wales.</p> <p>Anglesey, off the coast of north-west Wales, already has a successful colony of 400 wild reds following a cull of greys in 1998. But even the protection of being totally enclosed by water is not sometimes enough, says Collings: \"Greys can swim across the fast-flowing waters of the Menai Strait. If they can see trees over the water they will attempt the journey. It takes just one to spread the pox.\"</p> <p>There is not universal support for a mass cull of greys, though. Animal Aid, the animal rights charity, called for a <a href=\"http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/NEWS/news_wildlife/ALL/2329/\" title=\"\">boycott of Duchy Original products</a> in 2010 when Prince Charles went public with his support for the project in Cornwall. \"Poisoning, shooting or bludgeoning [greys] to death in a sack is irrational, inhumane and doomed to fail,\" said the charity, who thinks the public has been fed the \"emotive anthropomorphism\" of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Squirrel_Nutkin\" title=\"\">Beatrix Potter's Squirrel Nutkin</a> too often by conservationists seeking to bring back reds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chrispackham.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chris Packham</a>, the BBC wildlife presenter, <a href=\"http://www.animalaid.org.uk/images/pdf/factfiles/Squirrel.pdf\" title=\"\">has described</a> those who seek to eradicate greys as \"a small band of lunatics\" who are \"blinded by sentimental racism\". He says introducing greys was a mistake by the Victorians, but that conservationists need to accept that the \"perfect paradise is lost\" and that non-native species are now an integral part of the UK's flora and fauna: \"If the grey squirrels have to go then so do all the rabbits, hares, four of our six deer species and so on.\"</p> <p>Collings accepts that gaining support for the cull is an on-going challenge: \"Yes, there needs to be a public appetite to remove greys. But until someone develops a pox vaccine for reds, baiting and killing greys is the best method for stopping the few remaining reds from being lost forever.\"</p>",

Turkey's Internet regulator wanted to introduce a selection of filters that users would choose from before browsing the Internet. Also, some words could be banned, such as \"blond\" and \"sister-in-law\".</p> </blockquote> <p> There have been suspicions, which we've been unable to confirm, that Turkey has attempted some internet filtering of content moving in and out of the country.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/4/3291249/the-end-of-android-tablets-google-amazon-kindle-fire-microsoft-windows-8\">The end of Android tablets: can Google match Amazon's success before Microsoft closes the window? &gt;&gt; The Verge</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>There are many reasons Google's massively successful phone operating system has basically fizzled on tablets - uninspiring hardware and bad third party software chief amongst them - but ultimately the biggest problem is the lack of a single Android tablet ecosystem worth anything to consumers. Launching a successful Android tablet on the merits of \"having an Android tablet\" alone has basically been a non-starter for everyone who's tried. Amazon's key insight with the Fire was to use Android as the means to enable another ecosystem that provides value to consumers, and everyone else is racing to adopt the same model - even Google. What is the Nexus 7 but a window into Google Play? If anything, the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire are the Android answer to the iPod touch, not the iPad - devices excellently suited to consuming media content and running phone apps, but not anywhere close to laptop replacements.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.slashgear.com/nokia-pureview-chief-slaps-down-lumia-920-camera-criticism-04245842/\">Nokia PureView chief slaps down Lumia 920 camera criticism &gt;&gt; SlashGear</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>\"As said many times before it's NOT about the number of pixels but what you do with them\" [Nokia photography expert Damian] Dinning pointed out, going on to argue that \"the future of photography will be about how you use pixels, optics and image processing together.\"</p> <p> Contrary to those suggesting that a PureView Lumia would need considerably more than 8-megapixels in order to qualify, Dinning described the tech as more of a hybridization of multiple factors.</p> </blockquote> <p> (Thanks @Scoob1011 for the link.)</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/910610-could-google-lose-internet-search-supremacy-to-amazon\">Could Google lose internet search supremacy to Amazon? | Metro.co.uk</a></h2> <p>In general, the answer to any news headline that poses a question and ends in a questionmark is \"no\". The piece is pretty incoherent - it's hard to know if it's talking about US, UK or European share - but one interesting point in this: </p> <blockquote> <p>Whereas Amazon has its own app, Google is merely a search bar. Meanwhile, the growing popularity of Kindle devices increases Amazon's chances of being the first and only destination online.</p> </blockquote> <p> Amazon does have a faint edge as the world gets app-ified.

  "<p>A small child has been found alive after eight hours hiding in the back of a British-registered car in France where five other people were found shot \u2013 four of them fatally.</p> <p>Around midnight on Thursday the girl was found, reportedly under the bodies of two women in the back of the car. The child, thought to be aged around four years old, had apparently kept still for eight hours. </p> <p>The scene of the shooting had been sealed off to avoid it being contaminated before the arrival of a special police investigation unit, which got to the scene around midnight. The local prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, said: \"She couldn't tell the difference between the good and the bad people. She immediately smiled and began speaking in English when a gendarme took her in his arms and carried out out of the car.\"</p> <p>French press reported the owner of the car, registered in the UK, was \"most probably\" the driver who had been shot dead and was found slumped over the driving wheel. One of the two women sitting in the back seat, also shot dead, was thought to be his wife.</p> <p>The family had been styaying at a campsite in Saint-Jorioz with their two daughters.</p> <p>A fourth person, a male cyclist, has been identified as a French man living a few kilometres from the spot where the shootings took place. Police believed he was \"in the wrong place at the wrong time\".</p> <p>Police say there are still no clues as to the motive for the killings.</p> <p>The alarm was raised by a cyclist \u2013 said to be British \u2013 who discovered a girl lying seriously injured in front of a BMW in a secluded car park near the village of Chevaline, close to Lake Annecy. He was in a state of shock afterwards but spoke to police officers.</p> <p>A man at the driver's wheel and two women in the rear seats had all been shot dead.</p> <p>A second man \"dressed in cycling gear\" was found \"in the proximity of the car\", according to French police.</p> <p>They said the ground around the vehicle was littered with bullet cartridges, suggesting all the gunshots had come from outside the car. A bicycle belonging to the man was found nearby.</p> <p>The wounded young girl aged between six and seven years old who was found near the car was taken by helicopter to Grenoble hospital where surgeons were fighting to save her life. A source told French journalists that she had been hit by at least three bullets.</p> <p>No arrests have yet been made and no weapon has been found. Forensic experts from the Criminal Research Institute of the National Gendarmerie were set to arrive on the scene from Paris on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Autopsies were planned for Thursday or Friday, the Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud said.</p> <p>He said the discovery was like a scene from a film: \"We don't know who could have done this. We have no idea.\"</p> <p>He added that the victims were \"found very shortly after the shootings\".</p> <p>No details of the ages or nationality of the victims were released by the French police. Maillaud said: \"The car is an English car, we are sure of that, but we don't know their nationality. It is not possible to move the people before tomorrow [Thursday] morning. We don't have access to documents to know who the people are.\"</p> <p>A police spokesman told the Mirror: \"From the registration we believe this family may have been British.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office is investigating. A spokesman said: \"We are aware of the reports of the shooting and we are looking into these urgently.\"</p> <p>The area around the car park was sealed off and 60 gendarmes were searching for evidence. \"At this stage of the inquiry we cannot have any idea what happened,\" said the public prosecutor, Eric Maillaud. The local Dauphin Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 newspaper said Chevaline residents had reported seeing a car leaving the village at high speed late on Thursday afternoon.</p> <p>With a population of little more than 200, Chevaline lies within the boundaries of France's largest national parks, the Parc Naturel Regional du Massif des Bauges.</p> <p>Leila Lamnaouer, a French journalist, told Sky News that it was unclear if the victims were local or tourists.</p> <p>\"A lot of people are coming here to spend holidays and use the lake because we have a beautiful landscape,\" she said. \"A lot of English people live here because they love the place.\" French newspaper L'Essor Savoyard reported that locals had been left shocked by the attacks, saying that the region was usually quiet.</p> <p>Mayor Didier Berthollet told the newspaper that the victims are not from the area and that the forest road where the car was found is very popular with walkers.</p>"
