  "<p>Tom Stoppard, a fluent and sensitive adaptor, has made a distinguished job of carving a workable screenplay from Tolstoy's 950-page novel, and Joe Wright has found a distinctive way of bringing it to the screen with Keira Knightley as Anna, Jude Law as her middle-aged, cuckolded husband, Karenin, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as her dashing lover, Count Vronsky. The last serious attempt to film <em>Anna Karenina</em> was by <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0118623/\" title=\"\">Bernard Rose</a> in 1997, a&#xa0;lumbering work shot largely on Russian locations in the style of <em>Dr Zhivago</em>, with Sophie Marceau hopelessly inadequate as Anna, James Fox inexpressive as Karenin and Sean Bean virile in a rather unaristocratic way as Vronsky.</p> <p>Having felt with some justification that he hadn't done justice to this towering masterpiece, Rose subsequently set about making innovative, low-budget versions of lesser Tolstoy fictions. In 2000 he turned <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> into a bitter tale of Hollywood as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2002/jul/19/1\" title=\"\"><em>Ivans xtc</em></a>. Then, in 2008, he transposed <em>The Kreutzer Sonata</em>, the bleak story of a disastrous marriage, from tsarist Russia to present-day California. This past week the Venice festival hosted the premiere of <em>Boxing Day</em>, in which Rose relocates Tolstoy's Master and Man, the tale of an unscrupulous property developer, from the steppes of 19th-century Russia to contemporary Colorado.</p> <p>Famous for his highly accomplished adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2005/sep/16/2\" title=\"\"><em>Pride and Prejudice</em></a> starring Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, Wright may have come to a similar conclusion about <a href=\"http://focusfeatures.com/anna_karenina\" title=\"\"><em>Anna Karenina</em></a>, ie that the last thing serious moviegoers are looking for is another conventional version of a familiar literary classic. So he decided (apparently after Stoppard had completed his screenplay) to stage his <em>Anna</em> in and around a Russian theatre in the 1870s. His intention was to create a large-scale image of upper-class tsarist society. This symbolic theatre is a place of dramatic performance and moral judgment, a forum where aristocrats gather to see and be seen, to observe and to censure. It is not clear where the notion came from, but one infers that the thought struck Wright after his disappointing discovery that all the obvious locations for the film had become so familiar that something was desperately needed to justify and enliven his project.</p> <p>There are, however, certain illustrious cinematic precedents for what he has done. These include Max Oph\u00fcls setting <em>Lola Mont\u00e8s</em>, his biography of the 19th-century adventuress, in a touring circus where the ringmaster (Peter Ustinov) unfolds her story in flashback; Richard Attenborough's <em>Oh! What a Lovely War</em> ironically presenting the first world war as an end-of-pier entertainment on the Brighton seafront; and Raoul Ruiz's <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0189142/\" title=\"\"><em>Le temps retrouv\u00e9</em></a>, which draws its basic narrative from the final volume of Proust's <em>A la recherche du temps perdu</em>, but encompasses the whole sequence of novels in a kaleidoscopic film that captures a world and an era while playing Proust the writer against Proust the participant.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rPGLRO3fZnQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rPGLRO3fZnQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Wright's movie is a dazzling affair, a highly stylised treatment of a realistic novel, superbly designed by Sarah Greenwood and edited by Melanie Ann Oliver, with rich photography by Seamus McGarvey, sumptuous costumes by Jacqueline Durran and a highly romantic Tchaikovskian score by Dario Marianelli, all previous Wright collaborators. The theatre stage with its oil lamp footlights is sometimes a real stage with 19th-century flats and sometimes a venue for actual events such as the provincial racecourse where Count Vronsky has his terrible fall. The pit of the auditorium becomes a Moscow ballroom where Anna seduces Vronsky away from Kitty on the dancefloor, an opera house and the St Petersburg council chamber where Karenin conducts his business.</p> <p>Other scenes take place in the wings and up among the flies above the stage. At an important dramatic point, Levin (Domhnall Gleeson), the awkward, honest landowner, a character close to Tolstoy himself, is rejected by his future wife, Kitty. He makes his exit from the back of the theatre, the giant doors opening up on to the real countryside, at once announcing his rejection of city life and his embracing of his responsibility to agriculture and to his peasants on his estate.</p> <p>The movie version has to jettison a great deal of the book's essential digressions into politics and social affairs, but it does well by its core issue. This is, of course, the presentation and examination of love in its many forms \u2013 the destructive romantic passion of Anna for Vronsky (with its sense of the closeness of sexual love to murder); the happy, amoral amorousness of her brother, Oblonsky; the gentle companionate love of Levin for Kitty; the cold, possessive detachment of Karenin \u2013 and it is forceful, if obvious, on the operation of the double standard&#xa0;in society. \"I'd call if she broke&#xa0;the law,\" one society matron remarks of ostracising Anna, \"but she broke the <em>rules</em>.\"</p> <p>The operatic, balletic, theatrical style is less effective, however, when it comes to intimate and reflective moments, certainly in the scenes involving Taylor-Johnson's pallid, unalluring Vronsky. Still, Knightley's Anna has the right combination of passion, confusion, cruelty and near madness, and there's a brilliant moment (which comes out of the novel) where she reveals her physical revulsion for her husband by angrily criticising his irritating habit of cracking his knuckles.</p> <p>Yet it has to be said that the film is only occasionally touching and rarely truly moving. The death of the wheel-tapper, accidentally trapped under a train, is infinitely more affecting and memorable than Anna's suicide that it is carefully set up to foreshadow. This has something to do with the stylised presentation. Our constant admiration for Wright's virtuosity, initially attractive and exciting, ends up as a major distraction. This kind of extreme theatricality is not necessarily unsuited to cinema, but it should not become a barrier to emotional involvement.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p> <p>Walking into the first rehearsal I didn't realise this was really the start of my \"favourite week ever'' (which, if my wife asks, was our honeymoon). I managed to miss the train's departure from London but caught up with everyone in Leeds for the first night of rehearsals, which were in full swing. I'd been biting my nails about working with such a huge group of artists from all over the world, including some of my idols \u2013 Tony Allen, Baaba Maal, Bassekou Kouyate, Martina Topley-Bird \u2013 as well exciting young guns like Fatou Diawara, Manifest, The Bots, Rye Rye, and Jack from Bombay Bicycle Club. Let the games begin ...</p> <p> <strong>Day 2 Middlesborough</strong></p> <p>We started the day off with a pop-up show at a YMCA in Bradford where Rizzle Kicks did some freestyling before Maximo Park played. I took part in a workshop to help encourage a new wave of producers in Bradford.</p> <p>The rush I got seeing our train \u2013 the Africa Express \u2013 for the first time, chugging towards us at the station, didn't leave until the tour was over.</p> <p>Then we were jamming in the train's rehearsal space (next to the massage parlour). We were musically feeling each other out, exploring and mining each other's idiosyncrasies.</p> <p>Then the first gig, where we came to understand how things would work, typically with each artist playing one or two songs, in collaboration with any of the other 80-odd acts on the tour.</p> <p>My favourite moment was the \"WE WANT MORE\" chant with which Middlesborough greeted the end. The lights came on but Carl Barat sang back to them without a mic - or rather, sang with them.</p> <p>Hotel party!!</p> <p> <strong>Day 3 Glasgow</strong></p> <p>Riding into town from the hotel to the station we were caught up in Rizzle Mania: throngs of teenage Rizzle Kicks fans screaming for autographs.</p> <p>On the train, we crossed the border into Scotland and a group of bagpipe players came on board, and walked through the carriages to welcome us with hearty Scottish music.</p> <p>My favourite new discovery in Glasgow was Jupiter &amp; Okwess International, a group from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I had seen them on the train but wasn't sure what they did and my French being as it is, I didn't ask. Boy, was I in for a great surprise.</p> <p>I finally got to play one of my own songs, Let Them Talk, with Romeo (from The Magic Numbers), the Temper Trap guys, Paul from Maximo Park, a horn section \u2026 and our secret weapon, the drummer Seb Rochford who usually plays with Rokia Traore.</p> <p>I also got to rap on Dead Prez's Hip-Hop alongside the Egyptian rapper Karim, as well as M1, Afrikan Boy and Manifest. I've been a fan of that song since before I could grow a beard, and I'd missed my chance to rap on it the night before\u2026 I was not going to let it pass by again!</p> <p> <strong>Day 4 Manchester</strong></p> <p>I walked into the lobby in the hotel in Glasgow, and the first thing I was told was \"Spoek, Peter Hook is going to play with you tonight\" \u2013 on the cover that I perform of Joy Division's She's Lost Control. I was ready to take off! I'd never spoken directly to any of the members of the band and wasn't sure how they'd take our version. But when he showed up to our short soundcheck, he was so easy going. The show was a dream come true.</p> <p>Hotel parrrrrrrty!!</p> <p> <strong>Day 5 Cardiff</strong></p> <p>I overslept and came down to an empty hotel lobby, which meant I missed the train, but a coach for such eventualities took me on to Wales. I started to form the idea of working with each and every musician on the train in some capacity. A lot of cultural barriers and walls have been broken down this week, in a really profound way.</p> <p><strong>Day 5 Bristol</strong></p> <p>The show was a bit weird at the beginning, then the energy and intensity and tension just ramped up. It had so many climaxes. John Paul Jones from Led Zeppelin was now on board, and he stumbled into a cover version of their classic Kashmir that the Temper Trap guys, Bashy and others were playing.</p> <p><strong>Day 6 London</strong></p> <p>The fateful last day is here. I am properly sad to be leaving the tour. Tonight's show will be intense, with some more suprise special guests. I'm kind of weepy and choked up to be honest.</p>",
  "<p>Jane Nicklinson \u2013 whose husband, Tony, sought assistance to lawfully end his \"intolerable\" life \u2013 has backed new health minister Anna Soubry in her call to help people take their own lives.</p> <p>Soubry said last week that it was \"ridiculous and appalling\" that Britons had to \"go abroad to end their life\" when suffering from terminal or seriously debilitating conditions. Assisted suicide carries a sentence of up to 14 years' imprisonment. Yesterday Mrs Nicklinson said she welcomed Soubry's willingness to \"stick her neck out\". However, in a Sky News interview she added that reforms that restricted assisted suicide to the terminally ill would not be sufficient.</p> <p>\"We're pleased that she has come forward and said this. It does open the debate even more, having an MP who's willing to stick her neck out and actually support assisted suicide. But we would like it to be a step further.\"</p> <p>Tony Nicklinson died a week after he lost his legal bid to end his life with a doctor's help, but Mrs Nicklinson is continuing with the case. She said she had been told there was a \"compelling\" legal argument for her to be able to continue the case \u2013 which she said had been one-sided \u2013 and take it to appeal.</p> <p>However, Lady Hollins, the president of the British Medical Association, said the medical profession remained opposed to any change in the law and criticised moves to reopen the debate.</p> <p>\"It has been debated so many times in parliament and each time those advocating a change in the law have been very soundly defeated. The medical profession do not support a change in the law.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bret Easton Ellis, creator of <em>American Psycho</em>, has denounced author <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/books/15wallace.html\" title=\"\">David Foster Wallace</a>, the US literary sensation who killed himself in 2008. While reading<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/books/david-foster-wallace-biography-by-d-t-max.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\"> DT Max</a>'s biography of Foster Wallace, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/06/bret-easton-ellis-david-foster-wallace\" title=\"\">Easton Ellis</a> used Twitter to proclaim that \"Saint David Foster Wallace\" was \"a fraud\u2026 lusting for a kind of awful greatness that he wasn't able to achieve\". He finds the \"solemnity of the David Foster Wallace myth \u2026 borderline sickening\". Easton Ellis concludes that Foster Wallace was: \"The most tedious, overrated, tortured, pretentious writer of my generation\" and: \"Anyone who finds David Foster Wallace a literary genius has got to be included in the Literary Douchebag-Fools pantheon.\" Better out than in, I always say.</p> <p>Professional envy is a terrible thing. This probably isn't the time to put the case for Foster Wallace as a fine writer or Easton Ellis (as late as <em>Lunar Park</em>, I found him acidly terrific). However, while everyone is entitled to an opinion, it's worth noting that at least Foster Wallace critiqued Easton Ellis's work when he was still around to defend himself.</p> <p>Even this pales against finding someone as intelligent as Easton Ellis in the grip of what could only be described as a full-on Twitter spew. This is akin to discovering a drunk leaning against a wall, vomiting helplessly into a gutter, only with bile-streaked opinions, instead of Malibu and Red Stripe.</p> <p>But then, Easton Ellis has form and not just via Twitter. Such as when he dissed the concept of female film directors (although one, Mary Harron, did a sterling job with <em>American Psycho</em>) or when he opined that gay actors couldn't play straight leads. All delivered in the tone of \"Someone has to tell it like it is!\", like a pompous parliamentarian or, even worse, a newspaper columnist.</p> <p>Easton Ellis appears to use Twitter to spread his cocktail party gems around the globe, most probably imagining himself quite the Truman Capote of the 140-character soundbite. So, whereas before, perhaps only a tight circle of Mojito-slurping hangers-on would have experienced Bret's posthumous trashing of Foster Wallace, now we all get to hear it. How lucky are we! But perhaps Easton Ellis has forgotten that he is better than this.</p> <p>Since his outburst against Foster Wallace, Easton Ellis has been accused of being a green-eyed monster who can't stand another author being hailed as \"great\". I think he should be more concerned that's he's becoming the literary version of Elton John \u2013 someone who can be relied upon to kick off at random targets for no reason.</p> <p>Well, I say no reason. It could be that they're feeling a bit bored, their lives and careers aren't as exciting as they once were, the coffee is cold, the croissant not delicious enough, and mischievous people are encouraging them, telling them that their bratty behaviour and ill-thought-out rantings are \"a breath of fresh air!\"</p> <p>They mouth off, in the process often making themselves look ridiculous and just a tad obsessed with their targets.</p> <p>Easton Ellis should realise that it's not his best look. In particular, the Foster Wallace outburst had the unfortunate effect of making him resemble a literary Norma Desmond, sourly railing against changing trends. \"It was the paperback launches that got smaller!\"</p> <p>Maybe instead of attacking deceased rivals, Easton Ellis could at least attempt to suppress his \"inner Elton\". Indeed, the next time the urge bites, perhaps he could consider slowly counting to 10 and stepping away from Twitter. Just step away, Bret, you can do it!</p> <p>Especially when the alternative involves coming across as just the kind of sorry, mean-spirited individual Patrick Bateman, \"hero\" of <em>American Psycho</em>, might have chosen to chuck a chainsaw at.</p> <h2>It's my Mars and I'll fry if I want to</h2> <p>Mars has got a nerve \u2013 the confectionery company, that is, not the planet.

All those millions going into marketing the bar as a dynamic food source, yet still some people stubbornly persist in dipping it in batter mixture and slinging it into the deep-fat fryer. However, what right have Mars to attack these or any other customers? What people get up to with their Mars bars after purchase is totally up to them. (Keep it clean, please \u2013 Marianne Faithfull said <em>that</em> never happened!)</p> <p>Arguably, over the years, the deep-fried Mars bar has evolved into a bona fide \"folk\" foodstuff in its own right. Complaining about it is akin to complaining about a potato being made into a chip or an egg into a fry-up.</p> <p>In this spirit, begone confectionery conglomerates and your snotty letters! I'm sure fans of the deep-fried Mars bar would make this point even more vociferously, were they able to get up out of their chairs without wheezing, clutching their hearts and starting a nosebleed. Some of us believe in the consumers' inalienable right to their deep-fried Mars bars, almost as much as we can't believe anyone would ever want to eat one.</p> <h2>Here's one clever way of getting rid of George Osborne</h2> <p>In a recent interview, <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/60776/lord_adonis_practising_what_he_preaches.html\" title=\"\">Lord Adonis,</a> who had a childhood in care, suggests that politicians with no direct experience of state education should not be making policy. Any politicians who don't use state education for their children are hypocrites with no clue. What lovely, dangerous honest talk is this? Just hypothetically, if we were to apply \"the Law of Adonis\" to the current cabinet, vaporising those who don't qualify, using a space gun borrowed from a sci-fi movie, what's the betting that it would soon look eerily empty \u2013 a parliamentary ghost town?</p> <p>David Cameron would still stand, singed but defiant. Michael Gove would be another shaken survivor, covered in human detritus from less fortunate colleagues. However, what of the likes of George Osborne, who sends his children to private school? After much anguished searching, they would finally discover what was left of George \u2013 a handful of teeth sitting on top of a cummerbund.</p> <p>With this in mind, I must sternly say to Lord Adonis that, while ministers living their policies, instead of just making them, is an interesting concept \u2013 and it's certainly one way of getting rid of George Osborne \u2013 it is sadly unworkable today.</p>",

  "<p>Finally, it took the intervention of Tony Blair to break the impasse \u2013 a standoff that almost everyone assumed had ended the \u00a356bn deal that Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg had been dreaming of for five years.</p> <p>On Thursday night in London, the former prime minister brought together Glasenberg and the oil-rich Qatari investors who had been ready to kill off his masterplan to merge his global commodity trading house with the mining giant Xstrata. That deal would create a group that is the world's largest producer of zinc, controls just under a third of the coal used for power stations and trades wheat, sugar and oil in more than 40 countries, putting it at the centre of the global trade in vital commodities.</p> <p>The previously little known billionaire had endured the publicity generated by floating Glencore last year mainly in order to pursue the \"merger of equals\" with Xstrata. He even seemed prepared to give up being chief executive of the newly created commodities powerhouse, ceding the role to his longstanding friend and rival Mick Davis, the Xstrata boss.</p> <p>Indeed, so friendly was the arrangement that Davis was lined up for a \u00a350m retention package, and it was there that the snags started. Investors, already buoyed by a newly discovered sense of rebellion in the \"shareholder spring\", were furious at Davis's potential rewards. But when Glasenberg went on the offensive to defend the merger during a speech to the London dinner of the Melbourne Mining Club in June, he ended by courting more controversy.</p> <p>\"Thank God my partners were entrepreneurs,\" he said. \"They want to work in a company that looks towards the long term \u2013 that wants to take advantage of a cheap asset that comes available ... So really, that's the real reason we went public\".</p> <p>It was already known before Glasenberg took to the stage that Glencore's listing had been designed to create a vehicle that could use paper, rather than cash, to buy access to natural resources. But what Glasenberg also appeared to be saying was that he thought Xstrata was cheap \u2013 so cheap, in fact, that he was willing to give up running the company in which he was to be the largest shareholder. The problem with such a line was obvious: other Xstrata shareholders might also suspect that Glasenberg could be underpaying. The Qataris certainly did.</p> <p>In February, when Xstrata and Glencore confirmed one of the sector's worst kept secrets and finally announced plans for a merger, the proposed terms of 2.8 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share did appear slightly stingy.</p> <p>Sitting quietly in the background was Qatar Holding \u2013 the sovereign wealth fund that owns Harrods plus large stakes in Barclays and Sainsbury's, among other high profile investments. It then held around 3% of Xstrata and that stake began to edge up.</p> <p>Then, just under three weeks after Glasenberg's after-dinner speech, the bombshell was dropped. After diverting spats over executive pay, price was back at the top of the agenda. Xstrata's announcement of a revision in the controversial terms of Davis's retention contract almost directly coincided with a statement from Qatar that it would require Glencore to pay more. Much more. Rather than exchange every Xstrata share for 2.8 Glencore shares, QH wanted 3.25.</p> <p>Even in an industry used to explosives, This was dynamite. By now Qatar held 10% of the miner and as Glencore was barred from voting its own 34% on the merger, it immediately looked like a blocking stake. That seemed even more true by the end of last month, by which time Qatar owned 12% of Xstrata. Even so, Glasenberg \u2013 who had started insisting Xstrata was not a \"must-do deal\" \u2013 refused to board a plane to Doha and negotiate. There is a sense that he may have been reluctant to repeat the trip, as previous efforts to sell Glencore to Qatari investors had fallen short after he was rebuffed by the sovereign wealth fund at the commodity trader's 2011 flotation.</p> <p>Those close to the Qataris also suggest the pitch alerted the emirate to another investment, as Glencore had a 34% stake in Xstrata. Quite why the fund preferred Xstrata to Glencore is not clear. However, according to those who have worked with it, dealing with Qatar Holding can be a lengthy process and the fund can eschew investments that might cause it embarrassment, especially in the west.</p> <p>Glencore, on the other hand, is a controversial company even within a controversial sector. When Glasenberg admitted publicly in April that the City viewed his company's assets as lower quality, it was essentially an acknowledgement that Glencore owned projects in territories other FTSE 100 companies might have shied away from. In May, Glencore was asked by non-governmental organisation Global Witness to explain alleged \"potentially corrupt deals\" in the Democratic Republic of Congo with partner Dan Gertler. In June, a Glencore subsidiary hit trouble when it was fined \u20ac500,000 by a Belgian court for bribing EU officials to obtain market-sensitive information.</p> <p>Whatever Blair said to Glasenberg on Thursday night, it was enough to overcome the arch-trader's refusal to budge on price. Even as the meeting to vote on the deal got under way at Glencore's Swiss HQ in Zug on Friday, he shifted part of the way towards the Qataris' demands. Now he's offering 3.05 shares \u2013 but on condition he gets to be the boss.</p> <p>Back in June, Glasenberg asked: \"If I wasn't a shareholder and just the CEO of Glencore, why the hell would I do the deal when I get to lose my CEO job?\" Mick Davis and his camp may now be asking the same question.</p>",
  "<p>A nice coincidence last Tuesday. As the joint select committee of peers and MPs met to hear evidence on the draft Communications Data Bill, which will give police and intelligence services the power to access all your email data and internet connections, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/04/fbi-denies-apple-id-hacking?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">hacking group AntiSec</a> published a sample of 12 million unique Apple device identifiers.</p> <p>These device identifiers may have included details of President Obama's iPad and almost certainly came from an FBI agent's laptop, which goes to prove that wherever you have a big database, someone will find a way into it, even when the information is trusted to one of the most sophisticated intelligence agencies on Earth.</p> <p>The point was not lost on the committee chairman, Lord Blencathra, formerly the Conservative chief whip David Maclean, who called it \"fatalistic\". Not that you heard much of this last week in the coverage of the rituals of a tribe of pygmies, otherwise known as the cabinet reshuffle.</p> <p>However, two of the most respected figures in the history of the web \u2013 its inventor, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, and the founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales \u2013 were vehemently against the proposals, not just because they were anti-democratic and represented a mass breach of privacy but, in Wales's view, because they are unworkable.</p> <p>Just about everyone from the London Internet Exchange (Linx) to the Law Society is opposed to the \"snooper's charter\" on the grounds of privacy. But let's forget that core issue for a moment and focus on the bill's origin, which happens to be the seething breast of a man named Charles Farr, formerly of MI6, now the head of the office for security and counterterrorism at the Home Office.</p> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, promoted the bill, but it is Farr's baby and, in effect, is simply a version of the vast data-gathering machine that he conceived in the interception modernisation programme under Labour. That this anonymous, unelected agency man persists with the creepy agenda should be enough to alert even the most complacent to its dangers.</p> <p>The evidence heard last week by the committee in front of which I am due to appear later in the autumn was pretty persuasive on the many basic flaws in the draft bill. Just about every area seems poorly conceived or vague. This includes scrutiny, security of people's data, cost, the effects on business, unacknowledged technological difficulties and actual effectiveness as a tool to make the public safe.</p> <p>The most obvious problem is that the internet is international but the law could only apply in this country and Britain cannot guarantee foreign companies will store the data of British users. Jimmy Wales said that Wikipedia would easily thwart attempts to track what his site's users were reading by encryption.</p> <p>One of the interesting points of the proposal is that data passing through this country would be liable to be monitored by the government. Foreigners being unwittingly subjected to British surveillance is one thing but if Facebook, say, agrees to collect data on British users, <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/\" title=\"\">Professor Ross Anderson, the digital security expert from Cambridge</a>, says: \"That data will be made available to the FBI, like it or not.\" Thus our government will be exposing citizens to unwarranted intrusion from foreign agencies. It is difficult to see how the coalition could go along with that.</p> <p>Mass surveillance of everyone, using special filters installed at more than 200 internet service providers, is bound to miss the bad guys. <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/p.m.sommer@lse.ac.uk\" title=\"\">Professor Peter Sommer</a>, an academic and expert witness on digital issues, suggested to the committee that surveillance could easily be avoided by buying a data SIM card, using an internet cafe or by means of draft emails on a web-based email service, where all the members of a conspiracy share one identity and so can access the same email account. Because the emails are saved as drafts only, they escape surveillance and so the email account acts as a discreet communications channel. The bill would obviously stimulate more and more ingenuity among those who want to break the law.</p> <p>What are we buying for \u00a31.8bn over 10 years, if not 100% security? The answer includes mass surveillance of innocent people, a worrying change in the relationship between state and highly monitored public, and a chill in web innovation and business activity. There is evidence that companies would not choose to operate under a regime of such scrutiny and an enhanced risk to our personal information. The case of Apple users and the FBI couldn't be more eloquent of that. But you have only to think of the recent instances of police selling information to newspapers, of journalists hacking email accounts and the abuse of the police database to realise the risks of vast databases with so many weak points.</p> <p>Glyn Wintle, who is paid to break into systems to test their security, told the committee that he once kept a log of data losses reported in the British media. It worked out a loss every two days of up to 200 million personal records, which underscores Anderson's rule that no large database can be secure and functional at the same time. That will apply to this Home Office system, however much money is spent.</p> <p>Most expect the costs to rise above \u00a31.8bn, as the Home Office chases the impossible goal of total surveillance. But the real wickedness is not the expense in straitened times but the pretence that there is little value in a person's communications data, whom they are communicating with and when, compared to the content of the communications. <a href=\"https://publicaffairs.linx.net/news/?page_id=677\" title=\"\">Malcolm Hutty from Linx </a>told the committee that the data alone could tell authorities about associations between people, their characteristics and, in the age of smart phones, their position from minute to minute. Search engines would begin to trawl the data for patterns of behaviour to discover who was in a particular location at certain time, for example.</p> <p>Given this astonishing power to monitor law-abiding citizens, the draft bill is remarkably weak on safeguards, proposing that the opaque and more or less unaccountable Intelligence and Security Committee will ensure against abuse of the system. One of the most worrying aspects is that if this bill becomes law, we will never learn how this vast expansion of collection and retention of our data actually affects our lives and distorts the nature of our democratic society.</p> <p>Everyone accepts that the police and intelligence services need to be able to probe the internet for evidence of wrongdoing \u2013 they are already making 500,000 interceptions a year \u2013 but to spend \u00a31.8bn on Farr's megalomaniac dream is not only morally wrong, it is plain daft.</p>",
  "<p>The continuing export of British-made surveillance technology has been thrown into question after the government admitted it had moved to restrict sales of spying software to&#xa0;Egypt.</p> <p>Human rights campaigners say the government's decision to restrict the export of Gamma International's software, the first time it has taken action on such an issue, is a significant step towards the regulation of surveillance technologies. However, many other products remain a cause for concern, they say.</p> <p>Gamma's FinFisher software can secretly take remote control of a computer, copy its files, intercept Skype calls and log every keystroke. It has emerged that Gamma demonstrated the software to Egyptian state security before the February 2011 revolution.</p> <p>The campaign group <a href=\"https://www.privacyinternational.org/\" title=\"\">Privacy International</a> threatened to seek a judicial review of the decision by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills not to bar the export of the software to Egypt. The action could have drawn attention to the wider sale of such technology by UK companies.</p> <p>However, in a letter to Bhatt Murphy, Privacy International's lawyers, the Treasury Solicitor's Department, the government's legal adviser, said an assessment of the software had been carried out and Gamma had been advised \"that the system does require a licence to export to all destinations outside the&#xa0;EU\".</p> <p>The letter said that \"this is because it is designed to use controlled cryptography \u2026 the secretary of state also understands that other products in the FinFisher portfolio could be controlled for export in the same way\".</p> <p>The letter suggested the technology would not be approved for sale to Iran and Syria.</p> <p>Eric King, head of research at Privacy International, said: \"We welcome the government's decision to start controlling exports of FinFisher, and it is certainly a step in the right direction.</p> <p>\"However, without swift further action to bring other British companies under the export licensing regime, it's just a sticking plaster on a bullet wound. There are a number of pressing questions about the circumstances surrounding the government's volte-face that remain unanswered.\"</p> <p>Martin J Muench, Gamma's founder, confirmed to the <em>Observer</em> that it was \"in discussions\" with the BIS.</p> <p>He confirmed that Gamma had demonstrated the software to the Egyptian government, but stressed that this had occurred six months before the pro-democracy uprising.</p> <p>\"Gamma did not supply any FinFisher products to Egypt that could have been used during the movement of the opposition,\" Muench said. \"Gamma only supplies its products and services to legitimate government organisations.\"</p> <p>The 2012 report of the parliamentary committees on arms export controls (CAEC) highlighted the use of British exports to facilitate repression and prolong conflict in authoritarian regimes abroad. In the wake of the Arab spring, however, 158 licences for the sale of arms to countries such as Bahrain, Egypt and Libya were revoked.</p> <p>But exports of surveillance technology, which are not subject to CAEC scrutiny and do not require an export licence, have continued.</p> <p>Almost 250 British companies work in the communications surveillance industry, Privacy International says. Of these, only 62 have publicly available corporate social responsibility policies and only four have policies that place specific constraints on doing business with regimes that might use their technology to commit human rights abuses.</p> <p>The government has hinted that the export of surveillance equipment could be subject to tighter regulation in the future.</p> <p>The Treasury solicitor's letter stated that the secretary of state for business is \"actively considering the possibility of international and/or EU-level agreement to further restrictions on the export of surveillance equipment. His current view is that this is by some measure the better option.\"</p>",
  "<p>They have the potential to throw the stock exchange into turmoil, trigger frenzy on bond markets and bring down the German government. So the eyes and ears of the eurozone will be on the eight red-robed judges of Germany's highest court this week when they deliver a long-awaited verdict over whether a financial rescue fund considered crucial to the future of the euro gets the green light.</p> <p>The constitutional court is under international pressure to rule in favour of the European stability mechanism and fiscal pact. A dissenting ruling from the court, based in Karlsruhe, southwestern Germany, would probably cause havoc on money markets and cast doubt on the future of Europe's single currency.</p> <p>\"The German constitutional court cannot afford to be seen as not being independent, but it also cannot afford to be seen as the court that brought down the government,\" said Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. \"They're going to have to try to square the circle; in other words, not bring down the government at the same time as asserting their independence.\"</p> <p>The ruling, due on Wednesday, is expected to give the go-ahead to the ESM, a permanent bailout mechanism, and the fiscal pact, but with caveats such as constraints on future decision-making or a ruling that Germany's basic law has to be rewritten if there is to be further EU integration.</p> <p>A government insider told the <em>Observer,</em> on condition of anonymity, that the court \"is very independent and always good for a surprise. Nobody knows what will happen on 12 September.\" A poll published on Friday on <em>Spiegel Online</em> showed that 54% of Germans were in favour of the court blocking the legislation, reflecting the degree to which public opposition to bailouts is increasing.</p> <p>The poll was released a day after the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, divulged plans for making unlimited bond purchases to lower borrowing costs for crisis countries in the eurozone. The announcement unleashed a wave of condemnation across much of Germany's media and among a growing band of eurosceptics, who said the scheme would stoke inflation. German fears of a repeat of its 20th-century experiences of hyperinflation and the catastrophic consequences run deep.</p> <p>\"A black day for the euro, and for all of us!\" a headline in the tabloid <em>Bild</em> said last week. It said the ECB had effectively written a blank cheque to indebted states by offering to buy their bonds. Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, issued a statement calling the Draghi decision \"tantamount to financing governments by printing bank notes\" and accusing the Italian banker of breaking ECB rules.</p> <p>Analysts noted that the once mighty Bundesbank had been sidelined. \"Germans feel utterly deserted and mocked by the fact that their Bundesbank has been so completely isolated, as has Germany,\" said Gunnar Beck, a specialist in EU law at London's School of Oriental and African Studies.\"While this looks like an attractive solution in the short term, in the long term it's disastrous, as it takes away any incentive for reform from the countries in crisis.\"</p> <p>Beck said the Draghi ruling had set off alarm bells for many Germans. \"Like many Germans over 40, I grew up being told of my grandparents' experience as very young people in the 1920s who experienced hyperinflation and were ruined by it,\" he said. \"It's a collective phobia. Then, as now, it's the people who are least guilty, who invested conservatively, who are the ones who are asked to pay for the losses of the risk-takers.\"</p> <p>Beck said it was likely Draghi had been informed of what the court's decision will be on Wednesday, ahead of making his announcement. \"Draghi, or let's call him Draghiavelli, is a shrewd operator who waited for the moment when his solution would seem the most opportune,\" he said. \"He must have been given the OK by Merkel and she wouldn't have done that if she hadn't known how the court would decide on Wednesday.\" He said the Draghi announcement would add pressure on the court, whose decision was vital to the future of the euro.</p> <p>The case was brought by a group of more than 12,000 plaintiffs, including a growing band of eurosceptics from academia, Angela Merkel's coalition and the hardline Left party. Karlsruhe shocked the political establishment in July by saying it needed two months to examine complaints that the rescue fund violated the constitution. Political observers believe the anti-euro group has the makings of a new party, unprecedented for Germany, where there are no anti-European parties.</p> <p>\"There's a certain angst now among politicians that people are distancing themselves from Europe for the first time, as the Germans wake up to the fact that Europe can no longer be united by Germany's war guilt, but needs to be united by the idea of a common, successful currency and by making it work,\" said Wolfgang Nowak, a former adviser to chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. \"Germans would probably do themselves a service by leaving the euro, but this is something that is unsayable in German politics.\"</p>",
  "<p>China's green energy industry has long been seen as a world-beater. But domestic pressures are mounting on its renewables firms as growth slows; and analysts are warning that Chinese companies could respond by accelerating their expansion overseas, stoking a rising east-west tension in the race towards a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>The European commission has just followed up US trade action against China by announcing its own investigation into allegations that Bejing firms are \"dumping\" cheap solar panels in European markets.</p> <p>But Chinese green companies are being hit at home by logjams on the power grid, the wider national economic downturn and increased competition of their own.</p> <p>Longyuan, China's biggest wind farm operator, has cut its projected new power installations from 2&#xa0;gigawatts (GW) in 2011 to 1.6GW this year and says it now wants to expand in the US, South Africa and Hungary. It has just pushed rival Iberdrola of Spain off the global top slot, according to a new report from Make Consulting.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the grid problems and other issues have led Chinese wind-turbine maker Sinovel to report a 96% dive in first-half profits, while sales income was down by almost half.</p> <p>Sinovel is the second largest of its kind in the world behind Vestas of Denmark, while Goldwind (third biggest) recently reported an 83% plunge in first-half profits on the back of a 42% slump in sales.</p> <p>These setbacks may be temporary and are expected to increase Chinese activity overseas, rather than reduce it, according to Robert Clover, research director of Make Consulting. He says: \"China has seen 50% compound growth [in wind energy] since 2005 but is now taking a pause \u2026 There is no doubt that manufacturers of turbines and asset owners [wind-farm operators] are now looking at international markets for growth.\"</p> <p>And there are already signs that Chinese and other Asian firms are buying European rivals that have been hit by the credit crunch, the running-down of local subsidies and low-cost competition from abroad.</p> <p>One high-profile example of this has been revelations that Mitsubishi of Japan has been talking about buying a stake in Vestas, whose share price has been hit by a series of problems.</p> <p>The Danish wind-turbine maker, which has issued a series of profit warnings and has been through a major board and management team upheaval, has already sold off a wind turbine tower factory at Varde in Denmark to China's Titan Wind Energy.</p> <p>And this comes at the same time as the financially stricken German solar business Q-Cells, once a world leader, has been rescued from the liquidators by Hanwha Chemical of South Korea. Another major German solar business, Solon, which has also in been in financial trouble, was bought earlier this year by the Indian firm, Microsol.</p> <p>Meanwhile, China's Guangdong Aiko Solar Energy this summer bought collapsed Dutch business Scheuten Solar, while Ascent Solar \u2013 maker of solar-powered iPhone chargers \u2013 has fallen under the majority control of Chinese-Singaporean joint venture TFG Radiant.</p> <p>But while these takeovers are creating controversy, there is also considerable relief that hundreds of jobs are potentially being saved by Asian-backed rescue missions.</p> <p>The insolvency administrator handling the Q-Cells collapse, Henning Schorisch, said: \"I am very happy Q-Cells has found a strong partner in Hanwha, which has the means to provide company, brand and staff with long-term perspectives again.\"</p> <p>And state-owned Chinese energy company Three Gorges Corporation helped the Portuguese government by buying a major stake in the local utility, EDP, which is now a backer of plans to construct the world's largest wind complex \u2013 1.5GW \u2013 off Caithness in northern Scotland.</p> <p>Britain itself has made no secret of its desire to allow state-owned Chinese companies to become involved in a range of new atomic power stations as well as buy North Sea oil fields.</p> <p>Clover says: \"Companies such as Three Gorges not only bring their own fresh capital but Chinese lines of credit at a time when lending from many western banks is constrained.\"</p>",

  "<p>Inside the main cinema at the Venice film festival the screen hosts a languid&#xa0;drift of evening shadows and world-weary bison. \"What is this love that loves you?\" inquires the murmurous voiceover. \"Where are we when we're here?\" I don't think it's the bison speaking but, as ever with the work of Terrence Malick, it's hard to say for sure.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149069/to-the-wonder\" title=\"\"><strong>To the Wonder</strong></a><strong> </strong>arrives midway through this year's event. It comes tipped as a festival highlight, another masterpiece from the American visionary, but it catches the delegates in a scratchy mood and they send it off with a chorus of boos. It seems that there is no film disaster more spectacular than the movie that overreaches itself; the one that gropes for the heavens and comes up shy.</p> <p>Actually, there's much to love about <em>To the Wonder</em>, a distinctively swooning meditation on romance gone sour and the existence of God. Ben Affleck and Olga Kurylenko play the ill-starred couple whose relationship blossoms in France and then flounders in Texas. Malick dips lightly in and out of the plot and arranges his movie stars as figures in a wider canvas, shooting Affleck from behind, in profile, or half out of shot. On boarding a Malick production, A-list actors accept they will sometimes be required to play second fiddle to the whirl of leaves in the Jardin du Luxembourg or the bounce of a wasp against the living-room ceiling.</p> <p>For all that, the film lacks the scope, rigour and rapture of the director's finest work, while its wafting rhythms sometimes verge on self-parody. The delegates snigger when Javier Bardem&#xa0;bobs up at the pulpit, playing the local priest. They tut in fury as Kurylenko begins another of her irksome, arms-aloft dances through the whispering grass. It should be noted, however, that Malick suffered a similar response when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/139929/tree-of-life\" title=\"\"><em>The Tree of Life</em></a>, played at Cannes last year \u2013 and still went on to claim first prize.</p> <p>Upstairs at a nearby hotel, director Paul Thomas Anderson is keeping the faith. \"Have you seen Terry's film?\" he asks me. \"Is it wonderful? Is it really experimental?\" Anderson was weaned on Malick, Altman, Scorsese, the big lions of 70s American cinema, and they remain his idols. He seems unaware that the old order has changed and that&#xa0;the student has now moved past the mentor.</p> <p>Anderson's new drama, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146341/master\" title=\"\"><strong>The Master</strong></a>, remains far and away the most potent film in competition, perfectly played by Philip Seymour Hoffman as a blustering cult leader and Joaquin Phoenix as the drifter who joins him. Controversy looks likely, thanks to a narrative that implicitly lifts the lid on Scientology, although Anderson explains that the film's main inspiration was actually the early life of&#xa0;John Steinbeck, rattling up the coast&#xa0;of California and wanting to be at sea. In other words, the drifter came first. The explosive figure of L&#xa0;Ron Hubbard (here remodelled as \"Lancaster Dodd\") was merely drafted&#xa0;in later to balance the ticket.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Olivier Assayas's semi-autobiographical <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/venezia69/apres-mai.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Something in the Air</strong></a><strong> </strong>plays like the sunny B-side to his last film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/138410/carlos\" title=\"\"><em>Carlos</em></a>, spotlighting the interface between heavy-duty terrorism and the bohemian 70s left. The film charts the fortunes of the bright young members of France's \"high-school movement\", fighting running battles with the gendarmes before lighting out on a freewheeling fugitive jaunt across Europe. These kids want to change the world, create great art and get laid to boot. Assayas observes their questing surge and dying fall with a warm, wry compassion.</p> <p>Rather to my surprise, I also relished <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/05/spring-breakers-review?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"><strong>Spring Breakers</strong></a>.

Halfway through, Gomez's heroine wants out; she can't take it. \"This isn't what I signed up for!\" she keeps squawking.

  "<p>It is a bold idea to graft Shakespeare's thoughts about forests and make something original out of them \u2013 to turn over a new narrative leaf. And the Catalan director Calixto Bieito, known for his imaginative liberties with Shakespeare, is in his element in <strong>Forests</strong>. Rebecca Ringst's set is arresting but one should take it as a warning: the stage is dominated by a bare silhouette \u2013 and this is no tree of life. Dazzling white light shines on to the stage but is more surgical than vernal. White streamers descend, nicely illustrating the line from <em>As You Like It</em>: \"Here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat.\" The show starts as it means to go on, as a congested but skilful hybrid in English and Catalan, with subtitles at the side of the stage, taking in <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, <em>Henry VI:</em> <em>Part II</em> and <em>As You Like It</em>, all mixed with Maika Makovski's beautiful singing. Her sylvan lullabies rock us into a false sense of security.</p> <p>If there are \"sermons in stones\" in this forest, they are not insisting on a straight and narrow course. The freedom here is sexual \u2013 and gender-swapping opportunities abound. Christopher Simpson's Orlando is unnervingly gorgeous in black wig, cocktail frock and golden stilettoes. Katy Stephens is electrifying throughout, but especially as Rosalind in a man's suit. The actors run breathlessly round the tree. Some cartwheel. They scream and kiss. This is free-fall Eden. The liberation within Bieito's forest also includes a freedom with Shakespeare's words \u2013 permitted to run away from home. As ever, Shakespeare proves tolerant to reinvention, his words pliant as willow.</p> <p>But what Bieito misses is the most precious of Shakespeare's forest freedoms: pastoral sweetness. Where is the \"good in everything\" in which <em>As You Like It</em> delights? Bieito's Arden is limited by its focus on sexual abandon, and even its melancholy seems one-dimensional \u2013 Josep Maria Pou dominates it as an unhinged philosopher in a winter coat who has presence but lacks charm, and is more likely to be admitted to an asylum than detain anyone with his wit. It seems that Bieito has taken Rosalind's description of love as a \"madness\" too literally, intent on committing us to the darkness she prescribes. One can see his manic anthology is about to take a turn for the worse.</p> <p>When it comes, the turning point is magnificently staged. The actors rush to demolish the base of the tree \u2013 earth spills out in every direction. What follows is as frightening as anything in Goya's black paintings. The landscape is suggestive of an open grave as we turn to Bieito's darker purpose. But the difficulty he faces is that, taken out of context, Shakespeare's tragic figures lose stature. Gloucester and Lear are diminished twins, Ophelia is doll-like, suffocated by a polythene bag, and when Hamlet says: \"I have of late \u2013 but wherefore I know not \u2013 lost all my mirth...\", he sounds dim, as it seems obvious that anyone in these benighted surroundings would have lost the will to live, never mind mislaid their mirth. Nor is the power of the piece augmented by George Costigan's tendency to give us famous speeches as if in inverted commas, in a you've-heard-it-all-before sort of manner (particularly true of Jaques's <a href=\"http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/SLT/life/lifesubj+1.html\" title=\"\">seven ages of man</a>).</p> <p>If Shakespearean sweetness is missing from the earlier part of the evening, it is catharsis that is absent from the second. In the pendulum swing from light to dark there is a failure to acknowledge Shakespearean hinterlands, clearings in the wood. Bieito sees this as being about renewal, but the concluding image of a tree decorated with red balloons seems an apologetic regeneration. For all its classy verve, this is a production that cannot redeem itself, will never be out of the wood.</p> <p>It's not often that one show leads to another, but in Flintshire's Wepre Park in Wales there's a chance to take a walk through real woodland of such beauty that it would make a romantic poet swoon. Even without any theatrical contribution, the time spent walking (between 6pm and 9pm) into the advancing night, towards the 13th-century ruined <a href=\"http://www.greatcastlesofwales.co.uk/ewloe.htm\" title=\"\">Ewloe Castle</a>, would have been a&nbsp;pleasure. <a href=\"http://nationaltheatrewales.org/whatson/performance/ntw22\" title=\"\"><strong>Branches: The Nature of Crisis</strong></a>, a choreographed tale from National Theatre Wales, is a wildly eccentric piece of work. It offers large chunks of&nbsp;gripping storytelling from the Celtic&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/myths_mabinogion.shtml\" title=\"\">Mabinogion</a>,&nbsp;but the most unexpected thing about it is that Argentinian director Constanza Macras's real subject is economics. We are asked to consider \u2013 on rocky shelf and by running brook and beside trees with curtsying branches \u2013 not only the&nbsp;modern credit crunch but economic history: the South Sea Bubble and 18th-century Scottish economist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Law_(economist)\" title=\"\">John Law</a>.</p> <p>It's an evening of striking imagery. I loved the wedding dresses hanging from trees, lit from within and, presumably, for sale. And although the narrative is frustratingly discontinuous, there is much spirit. I'll remember the funky Japanese couple exclaiming over nettles, the three drunk women on a hen night, squabbling in the shallows of the river,&nbsp;and the pining fellow by a waterfall singing lieder to a mermaid. Every now and then, adding to the rum&nbsp;experience, a lugubrious, unstaged dog walker would pass by \u2013 like a modern Jaques.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 <strong>Update 30 April 2019: On 17 April 2019 the high court of Kano State, Nigeria, ruled that the article published online on 13 February 2012 by the Nigerian Tribune headed \u201cBoko Haram funding traced to UK, S/Africa\u201d was defamatory of the Al Muntada Al Islami Trust, and damages and an apology were ordered.</strong></p> <p>A British charity is under scrutiny amid claims some of its funds have ended up in the hands of African terrorists blamed for killing hundreds of people.</p> <p>Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group in Nigeria with close links to al-Qaida, has targeted churches and Christians as it seeks to spread terror across the country.</p> <p>The Nigerian media has reported that the country\u2019s state security service, working with local and international agencies, believes money raised by the Al Muntada Trust found its way to Boko Haram.</p> <p>A charity of that name, which has its headquarters in London, raises money for disaster projects in Africa. It has attracted controversy in the past for giving a platform to radical clerics.</p> <p>Lord Alton of Liverpool told parliament in July there was evidence Boko Haram carried out 600 murders this year and called for it to be proscribed in the UK as a terror group. Its rise has alarmed Africa experts and prompted concerns of \u201cblowback\u201d for the UK as its supporters return from Nigeria.</p> <p>Alton raised concerns about Boko Haram\u2019s alleged UK links with the Foreign Office minister, Lord Howell, in July. \u201cI can confirm that this has been shared with the Charity Commission and the Metropolitan police,\u201d Howell told Alton in a recent letter. A Charity Commission spokeswoman said: \u201cThe commission is aware there may be some concerns with regards to an organisation entitled Al Muntada Trust Fund and, specifically, allegations that this organisation has provided financial support to the Nigerian group, Boko Haram. There are a number of registered charities with a similar name to this organisation, so the commission is not able to confirm at this stage whether or not this relates directly to a UK registered charity.\u201d</p> <p>A Met spokesman said: \u201cWe are aware of the information and are in contact with the Charity Commission, who are assessing it. Should any allegations of criminal offences come to light, we would investigate. There is no police investigation at this stage.\u201d</p> <p>A former associate of the London-based trust said there had been previous claims it had funded extremist groups, but these were 15 years old and had been dismissed.

  "<p>Six years ago the musician Nick Cave and the director John Hillcoat made the visually striking, ultra-violent outback western, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/mar/12/review.features?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"><em>The Proposition</em></a>, a return to the glory days of Australian cinema.</p> <p>Their new film, similarly celebrating an intransigently independent, anti-social clan engaged in a fight with oppressive authorities, is less coherent and persuasive. The setting is now the backwoods of Virginia in 1931, the last days of prohibition, where a corrupt new law enforcement officer, the sadistic dandy Charles Rakes (Guy Pearce), arrives to shake down the real-life Bondurant family, the county's leading redneck moonshiners led by tough, tight-lipped Tom Hardy and his mild younger brother (Shia LaBeouf). More than a little indebted to <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em>, it's a slow, painterly movie with sudden, sustained outbursts of violence. Robert Altman's <em>Thieves Like Us </em>and John Sayles's <em>Matewan</em> are much better and more authoritative in their treatment of crime and social conflict in this particular milieu in the 1920s and 30s. But Jessica Chastain gives depth and strength to the role of a tough broad from Chicago hired to run the diner that provides a front for the Bondurants' business. She brings to mind Patricia Neal in <em>Hud</em>.</p>",
  "<p>In February 1965 the Hungarian director of the Royal Opera House \u2013 emerging as incontestably the greatest conductor of his generation \u2013 flew to Tel Aviv to lead a series of performances by the Israel Philharmonic. Georg Solti had for a while been much enamoured by young television reporter Valerie Pitts, who had interviewed him in the Savoy hotel a few months previously, in September 1964, and he had pressed her to join him on the road. Early in March 1965 she duly arrived in the Middle East and Solti was asked by the singer Ken McDonald how long the comely blond visitor was planning to stay. \"For the rest of her life,\" replied the maestro.</p> <p>Pitts had been working as an interviewer and announcer for the BBC, with her own programme covering cultural events in the week ahead. \"I wrote and researched the programme during the previous week, ready for transmission on a Monday evening,\" recalls Lady Solti today. \"At the end of August there was a last-minute change of plan. The clip of the new film I was going to talk about was held up in customs. I was in a total panic. It was Friday afternoon and I had to find an item. So I thought: the Royal Opera House \u2013 maybe they've got a ballet or an opera \u2013 and Sheila Porter in the Opera House press office said, 'Well, there's always Solti. He's doing a new <em>Ring</em>.' She rang back a few minutes later, saying: 'He'll do it. Make yourself pretty and be there at 11, at the Savoy.' That was all very well but where on a Friday at 5.30 was I going to find a film crew for the next day?</p> <p>\"A minor miracle happened \u2013 the BBC could send a crew, providing I could finish in time for them to be at Arsenal football ground for the kick-off. So off I went to interview Solti, without knowing quite what I was going to talk to him about. I knew nothing of the <em>Ring</em>, except that it was very long, in German and by Richard Wagner.\"</p> <p>\"When I arrived at the Savoy the film crew were becoming agitated as there was no sign of him. The receptionist told me that Dr Solti was in his room. I went up in a lift which was transformed into a red lacquer temple, found the room, knocked on the door and a guttural voice said: 'What do you want?' I said I was from the BBC, and suddenly the door flew open and there he was, wrapped up in steaming towels. 'My dear, I'm so sorry,' he said. 'I forgot. Do you think you could find my socks?'</p> <p>\"So I was looking for his socks under the bed and suddenly the door flew open and there was the head of the opera house press office, saying: 'Valerie, what are you doing there?' \u2013 with me, bottom in the air, searching for Solti's socks.\"</p> <p>The young reporter admitted to the maestro: \"I'm not awfully good on opera. Truthfully, I don't like it much because I saw a frightful production in Frankfurt \u2013 <em>Elektra,</em> I think. It was horrid.\"</p> <p>There followed a terrible pause, then Solti's brown eyes twinkled. \"My dear, what year was that?\" he asked. Then he laughed: \"Thank you very much. I was conducting.\"</p> <p>\"And that's how it all began,\" says Lady Solti. \"I was bewitched \u2013 captivated \u2013 by this man, and logic and pragmatism just flew out of the window. It was a <em>coup de foudre</em>. After months of turmoil I went to Israel. I arrived to a hotel room which he had filled with vases of carnations and antirrhinums. A few days later he dictated my letter of resignation to the BBC!\"</p> <p>We are speaking in Solti's London studio which is rather like a museum, now frequently used by young musicians as a place where they can study and rehearse. The place is vibrant with creativity. On Solti's old desk is a fragment of the living past \u2013 a score of Bach's <em>St John Passion</em>, on which Solti was working when he died, covered with his hallmark annotations in lead pencil and red crayon \u2013 his two strata of excavation and analysis of the composer's intent.</p> <p>Next month marks the centenary of the birth of the conductor, musician, visionary, jester, husband and father who bore witness to, and embodies, his time, the core of the 20th century, and whose genius \u2013 a word too liberally used nowadays \u2013 not only towered over the music-making of his lifetime but radically changed it in ways that are only now becoming clear.</p> <p>Fittingly, the 100 years that have passed since his birth will be celebrated in the city he made his musical home, Chicago, with a concert by the <a href=\"http://www.worldorchestraforpeace.com/\" title=\"\">World Orchestra for Peace</a> \u2013 which Solti founded in Geneva in 1995 for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. The concert will be on his birthday, <a href=\"http://www.chicago-theater.com/theaters/symphony-center/tickets.php?buy=true&amp;eventID=1833490&amp;edate=2012-10-21T13:15:00&amp;utc=1350850500&amp;eventName=World+Orchestra+For+Peace\" title=\"\">21 October, at Symphony Centre in Chicago</a>. (Another concert will have taken place in New York at Carnegie Hall on 19 October). The World Orchestra for Peace is made up of the finest musicians on the planet, who volunteer to convene from time to time to deliver the message embodied by the orchestra's name. Solti did this: resurrecting a very 19th century, romantic and didactic purpose for music into the ravaged 20th century \u2013 and now the orchestra performs in his name, beyond his lifetime, into the ominous 21st. The concert will be conducted by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valery_Gergiev\" title=\"\">Valery Gergiev</a>, and feature musicians who were part of Solti's mission to encourage newcomers and to hand on to future generations what he had learned from his own masters. Two great stars, <a href=\"http://www.angelagheorghiu.com/\" title=\"\">Angela Gheorghiu</a> and <a href=\"http://renepape.com/\" title=\"\">Ren\u00e9 Pape</a>, both of whom began the formative part of their careers with Solti, will be joined by as yet unknown young singers from the <a href=\"http://www.georgsoltiaccademia.org/\" title=\"\">Georg Solti Accademia</a>, a masterclass in bel canto singing which is held annually in Solti's Italian home of Castiglione della Pescaia.</p> <p>But Solti did so much more: he made music of magic and quality, entwining power and clarity, that no other interpreter of his time \u2013 not even Karajan, Jansons, Ancerl, B\u00f6hm or Bernstein, in what is rightly considered music's golden age \u2013 could match. In the studio, Solti revolutionised the science and art of recorded music so as to democratise it at the highest \u2013 still unsurpassed \u2013 level of atmosphere and sound quality. And in concert, Solti is the only name one can speak in the same breath as those that dominated the generation that preceded him \u2013 astride both the second world war and the iron curtain \u2013 Evgeny Mravinsky in Leningrad and Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler in Berlin. Solti was the true heir to their legacy on record, and their way of electrifying live performance through blending restless and rigorous perfectionism with explosive&#xa0;spontaneity.</p> <p>Georg Solti was born Gy\u00f6rgy Stern, the son of Ter\u00e9z Rosenbaum and M\u00f3ricz Stern. At the end of the first world war Hungarians with Germanic surnames were encouraged to adopt Hungarian names. His parents kept the family's original surname but his father decided the children's names should be changed to help their careers. He chose Solti at random \u2013 the name of a small Hungarian town. Thus Georg kept the same initials, GS. In his autobiography, Solti describes his father as a businessman who \"trusted everyone and was often cheated\". Young Solti was admitted to the Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied piano and composition, and thereafter became a repetiteur at the state opera.</p> <p>But as a Jew, Solti and many others employees of the opera house were dismissed once anti-Jewish laws came into force. As is still the case today, it is difficult for young conductors to find work so Solti went to Karlsruhe in Germany, where he was hired by the great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Krips\" title=\"\">Josef Krips</a>, who was duly denounced for hiring an Ostjude \u2013 a Jew from the east. In 1937, while attending rehearsals at the Salzburg festival, he was asked to replace one of Toscanini's assistants, who could not play because of illness. In 1938 the officials of the Hungarian Opera, having heard that Solti had worked with Toscanini, invited him to conduct a performance of <em>The Marriage of Figaro </em>with the Budapest Opera. The date was 11 March 1938. It was a great day for Solti and his family. Halfway through the performance the news broke of German troops marching into Vienna. The show ended and he never conducted an opera there again.</p> <p>The Hungarian composer Antal Dor\u00e1ti heard of his young friend's dilemma and invited him to join him for two weeks in London, conducting for Colonel de Basil's Ballets Russes. From there Solti made his way home where, in August 1939, \"at the age of 26,\" he wrote, \"I said goodbye to my mother and sister.\" At Budapest station he was seen off to Switzerland by his father on the very day that war was declared. \"I was never to see him again,\" Solti would write.</p> <p>There are remarkable pictures of Solti during his wartime years as a refugee in Zurich. In those days people made photographs of themselves into picture postcards, and Solti sent home cards of himself posing in Alpine dress outside his mountain chalet. He described himself as \"desperately lonely and depressed\" as he waited for war to end, though he occasionally conducted the Zurich orchestra in the Kleine (junior) Tonhalle.</p> <p>After the defeat of Nazi Germany, Solti was invited to \u2013 of all places \u2013 Munich. His decision to establish himself as a Jew among the ravages of the Reich was astonishingly foresighted; he was among the few to understand postwar Germany and Europe right at their inception, compelled by Winston Churchill's speech in Zurich inviting Germany and France to build a \"new Europe\" on the ashes of war. He also confessed: \"Like Faust, I would have been prepared to make a pact with the devil and go to hell with him in order to conduct.\" Directorship of the Bavarian State Opera in 1946 was his first and crucial post. \"It was a heroic time, both for Germany and for myself,\" he wrote. Lady Solti reflects: \"People asked: 'But how could you, as a Jew, go to Germany?' I think Gyuri [short for Gy\u00f6rgy] felt: look, we're all young people in our 30s, and it's our mission to create a Europe in which that cannot happen again. What were [we] to do with Germany? Put a barbed wire fence around it? But he didn't go there as a missionary \u2013 he went because he was offered a job. It was also fortuitous \u2013 Germany was de-Nazifying, and it must have been an amazing time.\"</p> <p>Solti moved on to Frankfurt, then London \u2013 succeeding Rafael Kubel\u00edk as director of Covent Garden in 1961, and by the mid-60s bringing the house to a zenith. Solti wrote later: \"I have a British wife and two British daughters, and British I shall remain\"; but also: \"I am a committed European,\" He was never really settled; his orchestral career was centred on the Vienna Philharmonic and Chicago, and he wrote later: \"My term as musical director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was the happiest time in my professional life.\" This was a Hungarian who as a refugee made Switzerland his home, then came to raise a family in London, had a house in Italy and an orchestra in America \u2013 a man without race or nation. Lady Solti says: \"He hated the term 'cosmopolitan'. Let's say he was a man who had lost his family and his country, so that home was wherever his own family was, and wherever he was making music. He was a person of the world; with a deep sense of the world, and a belief in the new Europe, right from its very beginning.\"</p> <p>It is hard to express what it is that elevates a great artist over a very good one, and impossible to account for the creative sorcery which enables someone like Solti to tower even above the greats, to achieve what he could with an orchestra, on record and in performance. There are certain composers on whose work Solti has stamped his mark with a distinction that has never been equalled, nor probably ever will be, so that his conduit of their intentions has become integral to the experience of listening to them: Wagner, Strauss and Mozart arguably \u2013 Mahler unquestionably. I remember sitting enthralled \u2013 even in adolescence, knowing little of the context \u2013 ear-to-the-speaker with my new edition of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mahler-Symphony-No-2-Resurrection/dp/B001LOKFPO\" title=\"\">Mahler's <em>Resurrection</em> Symphony</a>, bought with pocket money. And in concert: Solti's shattering Mahler Ninth at the Royal Festival Hall with the Chicago orchestra in 1981 left anyone who heard it dazed with wonderment. It is due almost entirely to Solti that Mahler's music moved from relative obscurity in the early 1960s to the sell-out position it now occupies in the performing repertoire.</p> <p>Lady Solti is captivating on her husband's discovery of Mahler: \"I think he recognised the sounds in Mahler as those of where he came from. He knew some of those sounds intuitively, the cowbells, they called to his intuition, and were familiar to him. He would say: this music is wonderful but we never hear it.\"</p> <p>Just as Solti had understood the new Germany while most (in his and every field) were still mired in wartime thinking, he also understood the need to perform and record Wagner. Richard Wagner was seen after the war as the composer whose antisemitism and interpretation of Teutonic myth was adulated, some would say kidnapped, by the Nazis. Yet it was his music Solti now performed to a standard no one but perhaps F\u00fcrtwangler had achieved. (But then F\u00fcrtwangler was \u2013 albeit as a man of genius fraught with political dichotomies \u2013 conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic under the Third Reich.)</p> <p>\"Maybe,\" says Lady Solti, \"he knew the full background and chose not to take any heed. Or maybe he just wiped all that from his mind when it came to Wagner. I honestly don't know. But I do know that people just did not talk about the horrors at that time. They were not looking back because they were looking forward with their duty to make a new and better world.\"</p> <p>She continues talking about her husband \"wanting to live every moment\". This was, she says, \"part, I am sure, of the survival thing he always had, like every Jewish-central-European of his age. He was Jewish with all that means in terms of the history of his generation \u2013 with an understanding of people and of survival that Anglo-Saxons have never really had to learn. I think the survival thing is crucial.</p> <p>\"He had a sense of the beauty in all things, something I would call spiritual rather than religious. He told me his father would pray when eating the first fruit of the season. I remember so clearly the special moment for Solti when he ate the first apricot, cherry or peach in Italy. He loved animals and birds and used to ask, 'How can humans kill animals and birds for food?' He loved listening to the birds singing in the trees, and he would whistle to them and they in turn would answer him, because of course he had perfect pitch. He loved the sea \u2013 looking at it and swimming in it \u2013 but disliked sailing on it.\"</p> <p>He took pleasure even in the little things, and would be \"ridiculously happy winning at games \u2013 ping-pong, tennis, cards or bridge, particularly if he bid a grand slam and made it. He loved trains and railway stations, and introduced me to the glories of station buffets, particularly the one in Lausanne in Switzerland and the Gare de Lyon in Paris. He had such an enthusiasm about everything he did and wanted to share everything \u2013 food, music, nature, jokes, literature. It was the same with music \u2013 the joy of working with an orchestra he loved, the joy of being with his musician friends, and the pleasure of working with the musicians around him and sharing the music.</p> <p>\"He was a working musician,\" Lady Solti continues, \"fundamentally a working musician. Although he became a star he was also an artisan, working with and for the music. He used to say: 'No matter what statements I make, no matter who I know and what receptions I go to, I am first and foremost a musician \u2013 that is what I am: a musician at the service of the composer whose music I am playing.'\"</p> <p>Solti was known by everyone he met or worked with for a blend of striving and of perfectionism \u2013 for pursuing the unattainable, never satisfied with what he had achieved, however magnificent it was hailed as being. \"He once said,\" says Lady Solti: \"'If ever I tell you that was a good performance, you know I am not well.'\". In his autobiography Solti describes how he learned from F\u00fcrtwangler \u2013 of whom he speaks as something like the teacher he never had \u2013 \"that all serious artists are often dissatisfied with their work\".</p> <p>There was another riptide cutting beneath this dissatisfaction, this striving: \"Gyuri used to say that the musician is the servant of the composer, and no one could ever be certain exactly what the composer's intention was, they could only try their best. Perhaps that was a reason he was never satisfied.\" Although he loved accolades, he always said that nothing in his entire career had made him happier than when he was playing the piano for a rehearsal in Salzburg in 1937, and felt a presence behind him. It was Toscanini, and Toscanini simply said: \"Bene.\"</p> <p>\"Gyuri always said that no accolade in his entire life matched that single word from Toscanini.\"</p> <p>In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was in the windy city that Solti became so rooted in local lore that his image was used on posters to advertise both the orchestra and the Bears football team, under the slogan: \"We both know a good score\".</p> <p>\"If he had a musical home,\" says Lady Solti, \"it must surely be Chicago.\" And yet, for a family with two daughters, \"this was a compromise. I'm an only child, and he had no family \u2013 so here were these two desperate creatures, with two lovely little girls \u2013 but no family structure apart from my parents. We thought, in our innocence, we could do it all. For him, it was the music and the joie de vivre, and for me \u2013 well, I just hit the ground running \u2013 and I still am in a way. Initially, the girls went to school in London and Chicago but it didn't really work. So from that point onwards the schedule in Chicago was planned years ahead to incorporate school holidays, and we'd go to faraway places and the girls would travel with us. But in summer we would all go to Italy where the maestro had his studio in the garden and divided his time between studying and spending time with the children.</p> <p>\"People would ask: 'Where do you live? Where's home?' \u2013 and it was difficult to say. It would have been nice to have a little cottage with roses round the door but that didn't come into it really.\" Lady Solti throws back her head, laughing. \"We were Gypsies, nomads \u2013 we always thought it would be fantastic to have some kind of amphibious, aeronautical caravan and trailer that could fly and sail to wherever we wanted. That would have been my dream.\"</p> <p>For the last twenty years of his life, Solti engaged one man to be something like a master of ceremonies, an executive director who made sure that the conditions were right for the music-making, keeper of the gates marked budget and logistics.</p> <p>Charles Kaye, now director of the World Orchestra for Peace, remembers being told: \"I'm looking for someone who can look after all this\" and thinking: \"What can I bring to this? I'd worked with Lucia Popp, Nicolai Gedda, Askenazy \u2013 but Solti was God in this world.\"</p> <p>Kaye gives a description of Solti at work: \"He would look at a work he had performed a hundred times before, but was still excited to see a new, unmarked score. And he's start to mark it; first in pencil, then in red\" \u2013 and Kaye produces, across the table of a friend's kitchen in Hampstead, a score by Brahms, thick with annotations and notes; a soft, probably 2B pencil, then the red crayon.</p> <p>\"What he did better than anyone else in the world was <em>study</em> the music, and turn his ideas into action. You could watch him working it out, having a hundred ideas a minute for a recording or a performance, the cast or conditions he wanted. My job was to enable him to work in the best conditions possible \u2013 what would Solti need in order to make this performance or recording the best possible \u2013 and send the shopping list ahead. Occasionally I'd have to say something like 'We'll never get that past Decca', but there was no saying no, unless there was a very good reason.\"</p> <p>It is incontestable that Solti both revolutionised recorded music and set a standard of sound that has never been attained since. His Wagner <em>Ring</em> cycle from the 1960s was recently crowned by B<em>BC Music Magazine</em> as the <a href=\"http://wpr.org/music/BBC-Music-Top-50-1201.pdf\" title=\"\">greatest recording feat of all time</a>. Solti assembled around him a group of producers and engineers who became known as \"the Decca boys\" under John Culshaw at a time when the British label was at its zenith. \"At the time,\" says Lady Solti, \"when television was new, and later with the advent of colour television and the development of video, there was also an excitement around what could be done for the gramophone after the advent of the long-playing record.\" A democratic urge was at work in Solti's enterprise \u2013 that the mass dissemination of music in the home should be of the highest quality.</p> <p>And there was also science. John Pellowe joined the Decca boys as a young engineer from north London who \"didn't make it to university\" but was blessed with synesthesia \u2013 seeing music as a series of colours. Not a great musician, but instinctive about music at a time when Britain led the world in acoustics and gramophone equipment \u2013 Wharfedale, Kef and Quad. \"The idea that we could make recorded music with breadth and width like that,\" says Pellowe, \"enabled a whole new generation, a new era, in music. And Solti had a real passion for the studio \u2013 he fuelled the central tenets of what the philosophy of recording became. It was something primaeval \u2013 he knew what he wanted. Solti was fascinated by acoustics, by an acoustic space. He understood that the acoustic space can be just as important as the notes on the score or quality of the musicians.\"</p> <p>Pellowe adds something the truth of which matters less than the fact that he feels it: \"Valerie may disagree with this but I think he saw his recording career as more important than his concert conducting career. A studio is a studio, and Solti understood what that meant.\"</p> <p>Pellowe would record with Solti in Kingsway Hall in Holborn, \"a scruffy old place he loved to work in\", and the Sofiensaal in Vienna, \"an old swimming pool boarded over to make a dusty old ballroom, with a lovely acoustic, though a little small for Wagner\". With his team, Solti established a system of recording with what Pellowe calls \"the Decca tree\" of three omni-directional microphones 10ft 6in above ground to capture the sweep of the sound as it flew over the conductor's head, then more directional mics to spotlight the woodwind and the back of the orchestra. \"We used fewer mics than our competitors but I think to greater effect,\" he says.</p> <p>Recordings were made, Pellowe recalls, in \"long sessions, whole movements \u2013 not little slices like some conductors. Solti would play it back, listen while marking up his score, and go back to do some sections again.\"</p> <p>But there was a human element to this: \"Solti would talk directly to me, unlike most others. It was not the common situation, where you have the conductor talking to the producers who then relay the information. Solti consulted everybody; it was a team effort, and Solti was part of that team. And when it was done, he'd throw parties for all of us. No one was taken for granted. That's what made it special, and that's how he was the greatest influence on all our lives, certainly mine.\"</p> <p>Pellowe went on to devise the revolutionary \"constellation system\", the creation of an electronic \"stage shell\" around an orchestra playing in a vast or outdoor arena but hearing itself as though in a perfect acoustic setting. He concludes: \"Whatever I do is the legacy of working with Solti.\"</p> <p>With its origins in an orchestra assembled at Buckingham Palace for Solti's 80th birthday in 1992, and a project at Carnegie Hall bringing together musicians from the conservatoires of America, the World Orchestra for Peace staged its first concert in 1995 in Geneva to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. But the timing could not have been more horribly ironic: Solti conducted a fine performance for the UN members and secretary-general Boutros-Boutros Ghali. Just a few days later, only an hour's flight from Geneva, UN soldiers delivered the people of their own UN-declared \"safe area\" of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre\" title=\"\">Srebrenica</a> to execution squads under the command of General Ratko Mladic, currently on trial for genocide, and looked on as 8,000 men and boys were taken to be summarily massacred by Bosnian Serbs.</p> <p>The international peace orchestra fared better than the organisation it celebrated. It was, says Lady Solti, \"a notion that some thought untenable at first until Solti turned round during the first rehearsal and said: 'It works!' From that moment it became a gathering of the best and most committed orchestral players in the world.\"</p> <p>It performed \u2013 among many other extraordinary concerts \u2013 Mahler's 5th Symphony under Gergiev at Krakow to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. And next month the orchestra marks Solti's birth in 1912. The concert takes place in Chicago rather than Solti's birthplace of Budapest but includes Concerto for Orchestra by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, the composer next to whose grave Solti is himself buried.</p> <p>Clarinettist Larry Combs and horn player Gail Williams are husband and wife, and play for both the Chicago Symphony and World Orchestra for Peace. \"It's such a thrill to play with the best of the best from all over the world,\" says Combs. \"I sit next to a man called Viktor Kulik in the clarinet section \u2013 I speak no Russian, he speaks no English, with only the music to communicate \u2013 so that we understand each other perfectly!\"</p> <p>Combs recalls: \"When we started, no one thought an orchestra of people who did not know each other could work at this level of quality \u2013 but it does, equally well with Gergiev as it did with Solti.\"</p> <p>His wife, Gail Williams, says of Solti: \"It's one thing to be a talented musician, as many are today, but they don't have a plan, like Mr Solti did. He had this bigger picture beyond the symphony or the opera itself. I was young when I joined, and he infused me with the greater colours of sound and his rhythmical integrity \u2013 he was like a metronome. He said what he thought and wanted, and made us think about that bigger musical plan. And his expectations were high: he had not only learned the piece before we first sat down to work but lived with it \u2013 and he demanded of us to have done the same.\"</p> <p>During the months leading up to his sudden death in 1997, BBC's <em>Omnibus</em> programme made a serendipitously important film with and about Solti. It is charged with poignant exuberance rather than sadness; it bursts with Solti's wise effervescence, even in old age, perhaps especially in old age, as he returns to face the country he had left. Solti reflects and talks his way through a visit of homage to his grandparents' grave, a performance of music by children from his home village in the presence of its young mayor; he walks the corridors \u2013 and revisits students in the practice room \u2013 of his alma mater, the Liszt Academy. And he sits, at the programme's end, on a bench looking over Lake Balaton where he swam as a child.</p> <p>He died a few weeks later. He is buried in Hungary, and the inscription on his grave is one word: \"Hazat\" (\"has come home\").</p>",
  "<h2>Take me there: Festival of Lights, Berlin</h2> <p>Berlin has long been feted for its colourful nightlife, but visitors will be in for extra nocturnal treats next month as the annual Festival of Lights gets under way.

  "<p>I dream a lot about miniature sea animals,\" says Natasha Khan, the 32-year-old singer-songwriter better known as Bat for Lashes.</p> <p>\"What do you think that means?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"I don't know,\" she replies archly. \"You tell me, Dr Freud.\"</p> <p>We are flicking through Khan's notebook, an A4-sized Moleskine, that she compiled while she was working on her new album, <em>The Haunted Man</em>. It is crammed, margin to margin, with what she calls \"mind splurges\"; these are jottings and intricate sketches that \u2013 were you, say, to find the pad left on the seat of the Tube \u2013 you might conclude were the work of an eccentric genius or a high-functioning crazy person.</p> <p>Half a page is devoted to diagrams of outdoor dens. There is a large section about a book of first-person testimonies from the last generation of British lighthouse keepers and their families. The video artist Bill Viola, director Ingmar Bergman and author Raymond Briggs are recurring presences in different forms. Occasionally there are snatches of chords and lyrics. The notebook starts off playful, but gets gradually darker, more desperate. It becomes harder to ignore the dark, shadowy figures that appear sporadically, menacingly on the pages.</p> <p>\"There's loads of drawings of these big black beings standing over my bed watching me sleep,\" Khan explains. \"That's how I was feeling doing the book. Everything I was doing, they were around, these ghouls that are chasing you or just always present and leave behind this sense of uneasiness.\" She pauses. \"At least that's how it feels sometimes.\"</p> <p>You don't need to be trained in psycho-analysis to decipher what these unnerving creatures might represent. The first Bat for Lashes album, <em>Fur and Gold</em>, came out in 2006 and announced Khan as a rare and subversive talent: not only did she write the songs and supply the dramatic, reverb-heavy vocals, she played most of the instruments and created a fantastical universe in which they existed. <em>Fur and Gold</em> appeared locked in for the Mercury Prize, only to be beaten by the Klaxons of all people. Not bad for a debut, though.</p> <p>Her sophomore effort in 2009 was the even more ambitious <em>Two Suns</em>, featuring Khan's blonde, femme-fatale alter ego Pearl. Against expectations, the album went to number five in the charts and proved that she could write a conventional pop hit, with \"Daniel\" winning an Ivor Novello award. Khan's look \u2013 flapper-era headbands, glitter, Native American threads \u2013 became pervasive with girls who didn't look nearly as good in it as she did and <em>Rolling Stone </em>called her out as \"the next Kate Bush\". Not bad for an uncompromising concept album.</p> <p>So, when it came to writing the third Bat for Lashes record, you can imagine that Khan might have been feeling a bit of pressure. Hence the shadowy monsters and the increasingly fraught scribblings in her Moleskine. \"Stress! Stress! Oh God, oh God, oh God!\" she says, leafing through the pages. \"I was getting very stuck and having writer's block and getting panicked and really upset. I was honestly ready not to do music any more because I thought, 'That's it, I'm just going to go off and have a baby. I don't want to do this any more.' I'd lost my way.\"</p> <p>Khan's existential crisis is being relived in front of me in Vanessa Bell's artist studio at Charleston, the idyllic country bolthole for the Bloomsbury Group in East Sussex. Most of the furniture is covered with dust blankets, but every inch of doorframe and window ledge is daubed artfully with paint in a manner that you imagine an inveterate doodler like Khan must heartily approve of. The house and its gardens have been famous for inspiring creative expression since Virginia Woolf spotted it in October 1916 \u2013 TS&#xa0;Eliot, Maynard Keynes and EM Forster were regular visitors \u2013 but it's a safe bet that <em>The Haunted Man </em>is the first pop record to have taken root here.</p> <p>As her block worsened, Khan decided to step away from music. She tried to go back to her old job as a primary school teacher, but by the time her Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check came through the summer term was almost over. She volunteered at Great Ormond Street Hospital, but they required a&#xa0;commitment for six months that she couldn't give. A&#xa0;friend, however, suggested she could do unpaid work at Charleston, helping out the gardener, Mark, and his infirm whippet.</p> <p>Khan came to the house regularly for a&#xa0;couple of months \u2013 time to plant a dahlia bed that Mark still recalls fondly \u2013 but it was long enough to clear her head (Khan being Khan, she also did a course on children's book illustration, made a series of dance films and worked through a reading list from her old college professor). \"I was quite sad at the time and quite lonely,\" she recalls. \"I was stuck in my flat in Brighton and I was desperate for a garden. Working with Mark felt like going back to my mum's for a cup of tea. My parents don't live in the UK any more, so it felt a bit like a little family.\"</p> <p>When Khan went back to her notebook, <em>The Haunted Man </em>started to take shape. It would be an album about England, a love letter to Hertfordshire where she grew up and Sussex where she now lived. Without even realising it, the menacing creatures disappeared.</p> <p>In line with any self-respecting, mid-career crisis, Khan decided to overhaul her image. Her long, flowing locks have been clipped into an orderly bob with a forbidding fringe and today she wears a simple vintage summer dress with just a dash of make-up.</p> <p>\"Maybe to other people it seems like I've tried to reinvent myself, but it's not in a&#xa0;Madonna-y conscious way,\" she says. \"I&#xa0;don't want to go out wearing glittery headbands again because I did that seven years ago. And I want to cut my hair because people cut their hair in life, because it's hot in the summer having hair all down your back and sometimes your hair goes a bit crap.\"</p> <p>The starkest expression of her new look is the cover of <em>The Haunted Man</em>. Previous Bat for Lashes record sleeves have seen her surrounded by candles, holding a planet in each of her hands or even the face of Daniel LaRusso (yep, The Karate Kid) spray-painted on her back. This time, she is buck naked, standing assertively like a huntress with a man, also nude, draped over her shoulders. The image, shot by Ryan McGinley, is stunningly simple and unretouched; scandalously, Khan hasn't even bothered to shave her legs. It's hard to predict what Tesco's will think, but it already feels like an iconic piece of album art.</p> <p>\"I was looking at old pictures of Patti Smith and PJ Harvey, those raw women of the past, just not giving a shit,\" says Khan. \"Or Frida Kahlo with her amazing eyebrows and moustache and I think that's a bit lacking these days: real bodies, real people. So I'm proud of that aspect of it.</p> <p>\"I did have a freak out when it first came out,\" she says ruefully. \"I'm only human, as much of me that is badass and like, 'Have it!' I'm still conscious of the fact that people are seeing something quite vulnerable and raw. But I remember thinking: I&#xa0;don't want to hide any more, I want to step forward and be bold with this album and it's happened.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UznHTBZIa8E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UznHTBZIa8E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The boldness extends to more than the cover. Khan feels that <em>The Haunted Man </em>is the most punchy and assured Bat for Lashes album to date. Although the genesis of the material was often dark and tumultuous, the result is unexpectedly upbeat and euphoric. The new singles, \"Laura\" and \"All Your Gold\", which is out in November, prove that \"Daniel\" was not a flash in the pan and overall Khan believes the record has an ambition and energy that is channelled more efficiently than before. \"I feel like I'm at the crux of something quite special,\" she says. \"There's a feeling in the air which is different to the other two. I feel like I'm reaching something.\"</p> <p>It's tempting to think that, in some ways, Khan has been spurred on by the breakthroughs of Adele and Florence Welch, or the continued excellence of Bj\u00f6rk, PJ Harvey and Joanna Newsom. \"I do feel like I'm glad they're there, it's less lonely because of them,\" she confirms. \"It's reassuring to see their lives unfolding, like a distant family member or something. You know, when you're in a normal family and you feel like a black sheep? But then you've got a mad auntie who lives in France or somewhere and she sends you weird things and you think, 'Oh, it's all right. I'm not alone.' \"</p> <p>Khan giggles, \"It's a bit like that. When Bj\u00f6rk comes out with some mad new album, I&#xa0;think, 'That's good.' It's reassuring.\"</p> <p>We should enjoy Bat for Lashes now as Khan makes no secret that her biological clock is ticking loudly. She points out that Lily Allen stopped after three albums to have kids and that Adele is currently taking time off, too. Khan's love life has tended to be, in her own words, \"destructive\" and the only time she clams up during our afternoon at Charleston is when I ask about her current partner.</p> <p>\"I don't want to jinx it,\" she says, shaking her head. \"I don't think speaking about my personal life is going to enhance the music, otherwise I would have put it in the album. I've given as much as I want to give, which I think is quite a lot. And I'm naked, so ppphhhlllbbb!\" Khan blows a raspberry and falls into hysterics. \"I'm not giving any more!\"</p> <p>The Haunted Man<em> is out on 15 October.

  "<p>What did your front room look like 10 years ago? Probably mainly Ikea with a dash of Habitat. Hopefully the past decade has seen it flourish, find a&#xa0;little individuality, even some panache. If it has, you have British design to thank for that. The years have been good to our interiors as more individual but affordable furniture shops have opened up, the trend for upcycling and restoration has brought new life to old wood and metal and the tyranny of the mid-price high-street brands has been broken.</p> <p>If you want to see the truth of this, visit this year's London Design Festival. There are more than 300 designers and brands taking part in the event, and interesting furniture will be found in venues from Shoreditch to Mayfair.</p> <p>The LDF has a residency at the V&amp;A, with the museum hosting displays, talks and events. Trafalgar Square will be home to the Be Open Sound Portal \u2013 an art installation which creates a unique acoustic environment. There'll be discussion and debate at Central Saint Martins, featuring top names in design, such as Tom Dixon and Thomas Heatherwick.</p> <p>And, of course, there'll be plenty of chances to lust after furniture \u2013 and even buy some. The main exhibition spaces where the furniture designers show their wares are 100% Design, Decorex International, Tent London, Super Brands London and Designjunction.</p> <p>To celebrate 10 years of LDF, we've picked out five names who we think are the stars of the future.

  "<p>Super Mario, as European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has become known, cheered the world's financial markets last week with his bold plan to buy unlimited quantities of crisis-hit governments' bonds to shore up the euro.</p> <p>But as the action passes to Germany this week, investors will be given a sharp reminder that this is not just a crisis of high finance, but one of messy international politics. Set against the hidebound, ultra-cautious ECB of the single currency's early years, Draghi has been extraordinarily bold, winning approval for \"outright monetary transactions\" in the teeth of vocal opposition from the Bundesbank.</p> <p>The plan should bring down borrowing costs for Spain and Italy and break the vicious circle in which investors demand higher interest rates because they fear a country could be forced out of the euro \u2013 and the resulting pain would make a euro exit all the more likely. In the longer term, if we ever get there, it should also help Portugal, Greece and Ireland to go back to borrowing in international markets.</p> <p>But central banks can only do so much: Draghi has no lever to pull which would fix the deep divisions between the \"core\" economies of Germany and its northern neighbours and the uncompetitive, recession-hit south.</p> <p>In fact, by yoking the new bond-buying measures to an IMF-brokered austerity programme, he could make the woes of those countries even worse. The experience of Greece has shown what lies ahead for Spain and Italy. Officials from Brussels and Washington will comb through their policies, urging them to sack more civil servants, push up taxes and privatise more public assets, and the resulting slump in demand will make their recessions even deeper and more painful for ordinary people.</p> <p>Meanwhile, whatever the constitutional court rules this week, German voters will become ever more fearful that they will end up footing the bill: there will be more legal challenges, and more pressure on Angela Merkel to take a yet harsher line.</p> <p>At the same time, voters in Spain and Italy will surely become increasingly furious and despairing about the penance being extracted from them.</p> <p>Yet against this toxic political background, Europe's leaders hope they can build new institutions that will require an unprecedented surrender of domestic control over tax, spending and the banking system.</p> <p>Draghi's done his best \u2013 but he's not Magic Mario.</p>",
  "<p>Jeremy Hunt, the new health secretary, personally intervened to encourage the controversial takeover of NHS hospitals in his constituency by a private company, Virgin Care, raising fresh concerns last night over his appointment.</p> <p>Hunt, who replaced Andrew Lansley in last week's cabinet reshuffle, was so concerned by a delay to the \u00a3650m deal earlier this year that he asked for assurances from NHS Surrey officials that it would be swiftly signed.</p> <p>Virgin Care, which is part-owned by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group, subsequently agreed on a five-year contract in March to run seven hospitals along with dentistry services, sexual health clinics, breast cancer screening and other community services. The takeover took place despite concerns being raised in the local NHS risk register about the impact on patient care following the transfer of management from the NHS to one of the country's largest private healthcare firms, until recently known as Assura Medical.</p> <p>The director of nursing highlighted the danger of \"significant issues\" emerging during the first year of Virgin Care control, which NHS Surrey has tried to ameliorate through contractual controls. There was also prolonged wrangling between NHS Surrey and Virgin Care over the terms of the deal, including staff's terms of employment. However, during the lengthy delay before the deal was agreed, Hunt intervened to ask for assurances from the head of the primary care trust \"that the delay is to ensure the best possible outcome for patients and staff\". Writing on his website about the issue, he added: \"I hope that Assura and NHS Surrey are able to complete the transfer of services soon, but I am glad they are crossing every T and dotting every I.\"</p> <p>The shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, said last night that the revelation would add to concerns about Hunt's appointment and his affinity to big business so soon after the furore over the minister's relationship with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp while he was culture secretary during the attempted takeover of BSkyB.</p> <p>Burnham said: \"People will be worried that what happened in Surrey will happen to the rest of the NHS under Mr Hunt's leadership. Yet again Jeremy Hunt bent over backwards for powerful private interests. Never before has a health secretary handed over his local NHS lock, stock and barrel to the private sector.</p> <p>\"If what has happened in his own patch is his blueprint, then now's the time for him to be honest with patients and staff. It is time the health secretary broke his silence on his plans and told the public how far he wants to privatise the rest of the NHS in England.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Hunt said his intervention merely showed that he \"cares about the interests of his constituents and has been working in the best interests of his constituents\".</p> <p>However, doubts over Hunt's new role have also been sparked by the revelation that he co-authored a book that supported transforming the NHS into a system of universal insurance where patients buy health care from the provider of their choice.</p> <p>The book, <em>Direct Democracy: An Agenda for a New Model Party</em>, sets out an alternative vision for a dismantled NHS. It says: \"The NHS was designed over half a century ago, at a time of rationing and deep poverty. It was, and remains, a child of its time, conceived on the principle that the beneficent state should be a monopoly provider. But we know today that monopolies rarely act in the best interests of consumers. Because government both funds and provides health care, medical professionals are beset with political targets and central direction, distorting clinical priorities and preventing innovation.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"We should fund patients, either through the tax system or by way of universal insurance, to purchase health care from the provider of their choice. The poor and unemployed would have their contributions supplemented or paid for by the state.\"</p> <p>Hunt also has a record of supporting the use of homeopathy to treat illnesses and it is claimed that he attemped to remove a tribute to the NHS from the Olympics opening ceremony.</p> <p>A source close to Hunt denied that the minister wrote the section in the book about the NHS and said that \"it does not reflect his views\".</p>",
  "<p>Call it a woman's intuition, but I got this amazingly strong feeling that, once he was reproached with humbling his women ministers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/david-cameron-government-reshuffle-cabinet\" title=\"\">David Cameron </a>would find a way of linking this unfortunate-looking turn of events to his overdeveloped feminine side. As soon as anyone asked how an ostentatious episode of female demotion squared with woman-pleasing concerns about \"scandalous under-representation\", the prime minister would speedily resurrect the version of himself as the bemused-yet-thoroughly committed young father whom we first met washing porridge bowls in those two-Conservatives-in-a-kitchen videos, filmed, if memory serves, by fellow housewives' favourite, Steve Hilton.</p> <p>Sure enough, here he was on <em>Daybreak</em>: Cameron as a frazzled parent who, neither knowing nor caring about the meaning of \"butch\", is simply trying to juggle last minute homework and the end of the school holidays \u2013 phew! \u2013 with his first reshuffle. Haven't we all been there? You see, the prime minister explained to an interviewer, Elwen had this poem to write, before going back to his \"state school not far from Downing Street\", all about a \"furry bear\". Bless, bless and bless.</p> <p>And somehow, deep into this Christopher Robin territory, Dad's got to deal with Spelman, Warsi, Greening, anyway, a load of random old bats, everybody's crying, but in any case he definitely ended up with the same number of cabinet women as before, ie four. Actually, it was five and is now down 20%, to four \u2013 but heck, who's counting, when Elwen's got this poem to do and Mum's busy designing stationery?</p> <p>On a serious note, Dad's planning some fine opportunities for younger women, in line with Mrs Pankhurst's new ideas. \"I hope they will be working their way up,\" Cameron said of his idealistic young intake, \"and through it you'll see more women at the top in future. I think they are up to it.\" Think, mind, let's not be hasty: this is the man who thought Warsi was up to it, and look how that turned out.</p> <p>While the prime minister leaves us for an urgent date with his rhyming dictionary maybe we should, before reconsidering the case for quotas, respect his argument that, no matter how desperately he might wish to promote them, there are, at present, no<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/09/04/david-cameron-women-trouble-reshuffle-_n_1853964.html\" title=\"\"> women</a> \"up to\" doing for their country what comes so naturally to their male colleagues.</p> <p>Could the mistake, for anyone struggling with the concept of no woman being as gifted as Jeremy Hunt, be to look at the wrong skill-set? If you were seeking a candidate of moderate intelligence, rationality and integrity with a rudimentary appreciation of the NHS then, of course, any 17-year-old Abercrombie &amp; Fitch retail assistant selected purely on the basis of her hotness and hairflicking experience might look more promising than the demi-disgraced Hunt. More pertinently, there seems no conceivable reason why Justine Greening would not have made a more impressive and sympathetic corrective to the vandal Lansley.</p> <p>But what if Cameron were seeking, instead, evidence of slyness, superstition and principles of limitless flexibility, allied to control-freakery on abortion, open cynicism about the NHS and a track record in sucking up to businessmen? Experience in sending inappropriate texts to professional flatterers an advantage? In that case, the appointment of Hunt, with his archive of Frenchified messages to Rupert Murdoch's PR, Fred Michel, might indeed resemble an NHS no-brainer.</p> <p>Even if there are, genuinely, no women with the unspecified but evidently repugnant talents prized by Cameron and Osborne, the marvel of this reshuffle, which reduced female cabinet representation to 14.8%, is that neither man, nor the chumps they have entrusted with PR, foresaw how it would look to those they need, electorally, to beguile.</p> <p>Do the party advantages of humiliating Greening and dumping Warsi, Spelman and Gillan, without so much as a compensatory peerage for the redundant commoners, really outweigh the unavoidable impression thus created, that Tory men, or at least ex-Bullers Tory men, are more averse than the City to senior women?And more repelled by middle-aged women, in particular, than the BBC? To the point that, not content with a level of women's representation that puts the UK 57th in the world, with a cabinet gender disparity that would be illegal in least one Nordic country and no female ministers in nine government departments, Cameron is actually moving backwards to some historic sweet spot between the arrival of women's suffrage and the first sighting, after decades of oestrogen damage, of a coffee-buying male minister.</p> <p>Supposing Cameron's instincts in this case left room for anything so considered, perhaps his tactical error was to anticipate only a backlash from Labour, whose cabinet history under Mr Giant Cojones, Tony Blair, followed by \"window dressing\" under Brown (to quote Caroline Flint), scarcely put that party in a position to carp. This difficulty could explain why Labour tends still to rage against Cameron's woman shortage not as straightforward discrimination, but as the source of government callousness about women \u2014 as if a sizeable cohort of Maria Millers would be compelled by their ovaries to endorse Labour's remedies for female distress. As we know, the newly promoted Miller, now equalities minister and culture secretary, has voted, like Jeremy Hunt, to lower the abortion limit.</p> <p>But to judge by the <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thecolumnists/2012/09/jill-kirby-david-cameron-missed-the-opportunity-to-make-the-best-of-women-round-the-cabinet-table.html\" title=\"\">ConservativeHome blogger Jill Kirby</a>, even the natural allies of Ms Miller are starting, post-reshuffle, to echo the Fawcett Society. Kirby reports her own \"surprise\" and \"dismay\", at Cameron's rearrangements, \"particularly given the number of bright and able women now on the Conservative benches\". Not to mention the entire kingdom, from which, had any woman been equipped for the honour, Cameron could equally have made his choice by raising her, via a peerage, into the government.</p> <p>Given that their memories are said to be longer than huskies', Cameron may now regret ever raising women's expectations, between telling them to calm down dear, cracking jokes about their sexual frustration and noting breast development in men who bring hot beverages for others. Not only is there that pledge from his feminist era, to give a third of cabinet posts to women; just months ago he threatened boardrooms with the same fate. \"The case is overwhelming that companies are better run if you have men and women working alongside each other,\" he declared, in full <em>Borgen</em> mode. \"So the real nub of the issue is how do we accelerate, how do we fast-forward to having at least 30% of boards made up by women?\" Yes, how do we accelerate, Dave? Although, in your case, just not going backwards from 14% would be a start. \"If you can't get there in other ways,\" he said, \"then maybe you have to have quotas.\" But it still took his reshuffle to convince me.</p>",
  "<p>Desmond Tutu's point about the morality of leadership is understandable, but flawed. He seems to imply that a sophisticated leadership should always \"bring the global family together\".

The point is that the global family may not want to have as a member those who defile and persecute others or their own.</p> <p>I am a Christian and I believe in Christian values; I also don't think that the Iraq war was acted out in the best way possible, but I do see that for evil to be ridded we sometimes need to act a little harshly. Now, if Tutu had addressed what some might see as the real underlying issue \u2013 the control of natural resources (ask yourself which companies with leadership/ownership from where are now controlling those resources) \u2013 then he might have a stronger chance of rousing the \"hearts and minds\" of those listening.</p> <p>His argument is based solely on morals relating to the basis of going to war and not on morals of obtaining the spoils of that war (which themselves are the reason for going to war: whatever one argues you always think of the outcomes of something before doing it, at least on the international stage).</p> <p>As such, Tutu has missed a key point in the rhetorical scenario he is trying to bring about and, as such, his argument will be forgotten in time, as it ignores the endgame towards which the war was pointed.</p> <p><strong>Euan Clark</strong></p> <p>London E3</p> <p>There have been many deaths in conflict in post-colonial Africa.

At the least, the debate within Africa over how to control Robert Mugabe should have given him pause.</p> <p>He might also have considered whether Saddam Hussein could or should have been considered a war criminal and guilty of genocide.</p> <p>If so, what then? Ironically, he appears to assert that the war in Iraq created the groundwork for recent uprisings in the Middle East, without realising that many regard these events as justifiable resistance to dictatorship.</p> <p>Others see great confusion and ambiguity.

  "<p>It says a lot about <a href=\"http://www.djerassi.com/\" title=\"\">Carl Djerassi</a> that his first venture into literature was as an act of revenge. It was 1983; he was 60, an <a href=\"http://oso.stanford.edu/lectures/53-carl-djerassi\" title=\"\">eminent professor of chemistry at Stanford University</a>, famous for his successful synthesis, in 1951, of <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a604034.html\" title=\"\">norethindrone</a>, the first oral contraceptive. And he was in love with the woman who would become his third wife \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/18/culture.obituaries\" title=\"\">Diane Middlebrook</a>, the biographer, poet, and fellow Stanford professor. But, after several years together, she had fallen in love with someone else.</p> <p>When he found out, Djerassi was distraught. \"Like any man, I thought, 'Who is this other person?'\" he says now. \"It turned out that he was a professor of literature. So I decided, 'Well, I'm going to show her.' And I started writing.\"</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, for a man whose intelligence and determination had already taken him from Nazi-era Vienna (he left his native Austria at the age of 14) to the highest reaches of the American scientific community, Djerassi's endeavours were successful. A year later, after showing Middlebrook his first novel, Djerassi won back her heart. He had also discovered a prodigious appetite for writing: today, if his literary output can't quite rival his 1,200 published scientific articles, it's undeniably impressive \u2013 five novels, two memoirs, several collections of essays and short stories, and nine plays.</p> <p>I've met Djerassi in the unlikely setting of a church hall on a south London council estate to talk about his latest play, <a href=\"http://www.riversidestudios.co.uk/cgi-bin/page.pl?l=1341220465\" title=\"\"><em>Insufficiency</em></a>: rehearsals have just got under way here for its premiere at London's Riverside Studios later this month. Like many of Djerassi's other literary works, the play is a comedy, with chemistry firmly at its heart. Set on the campus of a second-rate American university, it's about the disastrous fall-out of an experiment by Jerzy Krzyz, an academic scientist specialising in \"bubbleology\" (the science of bubbles), on a bottle of champagne.</p> <p>With his first play, 1998's <em>An Immaculate Misconception</em>, Djerassi came up with the concept of \"science-in-theatre\". In his precise, faintly accented English, he neatly explains the term to me now. \"What I'm trying to do is not talk directly about science,\" he says. \"That's too difficult to do, especially with chemistry. Rather than words, we chemists use the cryptography of structural formulas, which people [outside that world] don't understand. What I want to do with the theatre is to talk about the culture and behaviour of science \u2013 to show that scientists are not just Frankensteins or Strangeloves or idiot savants or nerds.\"</p> <p>Above all, he's interested in describing what he calls the \"tribal behaviour\" of scientists \u2013 and he's critical of the scientific community for being reluctant to explain that behaviour to the outside world. \"I'm a member of that tribe,\" he says, \"and it's a tribe that does not advertise its behaviour \u2013 not because they want to keep it secret, but because they're not interested in discussing it. We're not, as a whole, introspective, because we're so focused on what we're doing. But it means that people outside science have a very limited idea about who we really are, and how we think.\"</p> <p>People tend to have a limited idea of who Djerassi is, too: he's frustrated by the fact that he's still known to most only as the man who invented the pill. \"It's as if I did that,\" he says crisply, \"and then sat around twiddling my thumbs for the next 50 years.\"</p> <p>When I ask if it was difficult for him to return to other lines of scientific inquiry after making such a major breakthrough, he eyes me with barely disguised irritation. \"I was 28 when I made that discovery,\" he says. \"I carried on working and publishing for 40 years. Among my peers, I am actually better known for my work in other areas.\" Aside from his early work on norethindrone, Djerassi has published widely on other medicines, including antihistamines and antibiotics; on the application of physical measurements; on artificial intelligence and its use in chemistry; and on developing new approaches to insect control.</p> <p>He's reluctant to draw many parallels between the disciplines of science and theatre. \"I think you would like me to say that I see many similarities between them,\" he says, \"but in truth, I do not. They are totally different. With science \u2013 or, I must say, with chemistry, because that is the science I know \u2013 you must show your research to be absolutely accurate and correct. That is not the case with literature. But, when it comes to intellectual rigour, they need not be so far apart. I approach every play with the same emphasis on meticulous research that I have always used in my work as a chemist.\"</p> <p>One of the reasons Djerassi was drawn to the theatre, he says, was to escape the punishing process of peer review that is part of any academic scientist's working life. \"We scientists don't spend enough time thinking about an audience other than our peers,\" he says. \"They can make or break our reputation, and often anonymously.\"</p> <p>Can theatre critics not be just as savage? Djerassi smiles. \"They can be. But at least they are in a separate profession: most of them are not also playwrights themselves.\" And perhaps, if a critic does turn an acid tongue on <em>Insufficiency</em>, we will soon see this chemist, writer and polymath take up theatre criticism \u2013 purely, of course, as an act of revenge.</p>",
  "<p>When my two older brothers and I were kids my mum would make two dinners every day: ordinary food for us; sad crudit\u00e9s and dry crackers for her. If I had taken a&#xa0;picture of her kitchen every six months since I was born, what I'd have now would be a comprehensive visual history of diet industry fads: the F-Plan and tubs of bran; translucent milk and Cambridge Shakes; Slimming World folders and cabbage soup; low GI and sachets of dry misery branded with the withering grin of \"Dr\" Gillian McKeith. My mum's social life was yoga, keep fit and aqua aerobics; her conversation with other mothers was plumpness, jealousy and who had let themselves go. Fat, to her, meant failure. The correlation between those two ideas lingered silently in the air every time she mentioned her own weight or someone else's, and audibly, once when, at the age of nine, I found her in the bathroom sobbing and listened to her explain that she was upset because she felt fat and, therefore, useless and weak.</p> <p>I asked her, five years ago, how long she had been on a diet. \"Forty-five years,\" she said, \"as long as I've been feeding myself.\" I asked her why. \"Because I don't feel like I've ever done it right. I wake up every morning determined and go to bed every night feeling like I've failed.\" That information, obviously, makes me angry. Angry for her, but also for myself: the reason I was asking her about diets was that, as a 25-year-old 6ft man, I weighed just a touch over 7st. I was asking her as part of getting a&#xa0;handle on the way I felt about food, and on a relapse into an eating disorder that had seen me put my life and long-term health at risk.</p> <p>My dad wasn't like her. For him, fat was fun. When my brothers and I visited him at weekends he would feed us delicious, convenient \"dad-food\"; junk served up with the intention of making him the fun, most popular, parent: pancakes for breakfast, burgers and chips, buckets of KFC, cupboards full of all of the chocolate and chemicals three growing boys could ever want. His feeding strategy belied his deeply wounded personality; his fun-dad veneer was often quick to crack and give way to something stricter and more angry. A solitary abandoned chip would send him into an uncontrollable rage. \"I nearly lost my kids!\" he shouted at me so loudly that my ears rang one lunch time when I said I couldn't finish my plate. He ignored all three of us for the rest of that weekend until the time came to drive us back to our mum, which he did like a&#xa0;rally driver in terrifying silence. We learned to always look like we were having a good time with him, because his tempers otherwise were too frightening and lasted way too long.</p> <p>When I was 11, my mum was hospitalised with severe depression. It wasn't the first time it had happened, but it was the first time I was old enough to think that I understood the phone calls my dad made at night. During them, he talked about his lack of faith in her ability to get it together and his plans to try to get full-time custody of us boys.</p> <p>To us, he talked about how he believed having good mental health to be a choice; how he thought my mum, in having moments where she couldn't cope, was being lazy. My oldest brother, by this point, was acting out a lot and smoking weed most days. The other one was a daddy's boy. When we were with my mum, they would be high or furious at her on my dad's behalf respectively. When we were at my dad's, they would be good as gold out of fear and respect, but all three of us were frightened of the prospect of living with him full-time.</p> <p>I came to realise while she was in hospital that our mum needed someone to be strong to help her get healthy if we were to avoid that happening. To my 11-year-old mind it seemed as if I was the only person who could or would do it, even though the only thing I knew about strength was that, apparently, it came in refusal; that she felt strong when she did well on her diets, and that, according to my dad, strong people didn't get sick.</p> <p>The first thing my mum told me when she got out of hospital was that I looked chubby. I was heavy on puppy fat and a solid month of dad-food, so she bought me a new bike and I&#xa0;rode every day, as fast as I could for as long as I could. She filled my school bag with dried fruits and cereal bars and zero-fat yogurts, until I told her that I could eat more healthily if I bought food at school, so she sent me each day with money for lunch. I'd bring it home each evening and stash it under my bed.</p> <p>Eating my dad's food when we were at his house was not something I could escape, so I came to the solution of only eating that. At our mum's I would get up at six and say I'd had breakfast on my own. At school, I would maybe eat a chocolate bar or nothing at all. In the evening, I would say I&#xa0;was eating at friends' houses, or that I had made my own dinner while she was still at work.</p> <p>More often than not, she believed me. She talked with my aunts about how I'd had a&#xa0;growth spurt and how I was going to be just like my granddad, long and thin, and long and thin is how I grew into my teens, relishing the way that I looked entirely unlike other boys my age. My face, then, was angular and pretty and my shoulders and chest were slow to expand.</p> <p>By the time I was 14 many of my friends were older girls who were into the then-burgeoning goth scene, so I would sneak out to clubs and bars with them and be let in thanks to the assumption that I was one of their number, rather than a young, skinny boy. Once inside, I'd be swamped in attention from girls of a certain kind admiring my androgynous body, and men of a certain kind admiring it in a different way.</p> <p>At home and at school I felt overlooked and unwanted; in the clubs I felt adored, maybe for the first time. Skinny, I felt strong and alive, as if my body was what people saw instead of the scared, hungry little kid inside it. My body became my personality. As long as it was bony, it could handle everything that I couldn't and get me all the attention that I needed.</p> <p>When the time came to go to university, I&#xa0;had become more aware of how destructive my thought patterns were. Twice I enrolled in therapy with the intention of learning to cope with my fixation. Once there, though, I never spoke about eating. I learned to cope, instead, by channelling my need to feel in control into working and achieving, feeling special by doing better than my friends.</p> <p>I graduated&#xa0;and took an advertising job straight out of university. I felt grateful, but I&#xa0;also felt empowered to the point of smugness, because my dogged pursuit of achievement had paid off. The culture of my new company was half boozy lunches, boxes of Krispy Kreme doughnuts, table football and banter, and half after-work pilates and high-protein diets. My supervisor, Sarah, would do things like offer round wafers and say, \"Eat these, they're good because they fill you up by being mostly air,\" but I would just laugh like everyone else. For the first time since I was a&#xa0;little kid I ate without guilt, buoyed on by the feeling I had of being ahead of my game. I felt, for a&#xa0;year or two, free. Then Sarah asked me if I&#xa0;was getting fat.</p> <p>\"Are those little man boobs blossoming under your top?\" she said. \"You used to be such a skinny little thing.\" They weren't, really, I&#xa0;was just not as concave as I had been when we first met. Maybe a man with no issues would have taken it as harmless fun, and I'm fairly sure she assumed that's what I was. If it was the case that everyone who had a bad relationship with food was visibly neurotic, antisocial, unbearable, it would be pretty easy to spot and identify the problem.</p> <p>One of the reasons it is so hard to address male-eating disorders is that, usually, it's impossible to know who is facing or has faced mental-health challenges because, for the most part, they seem just like you. Sarah had no way of seeing that the idea of anything on my body being in any way \"blossoming\" or soft was not one I could bear.</p> <p>I got home that night and asked my partner whether he thought I had become fat. Most people, at some point in their life, will be asked that question or a version of it by someone they love. Unless the person asking it is about to drop dead from obesity, the best thing to do, always, is err on the side of nice and say: \"No, you're perfect, and you don't need to change anything.\" That's not what my partner said. He said, \"Well. If you're worried about that, maybe you could exercise more.\"</p> <p>The following Monday, I started the Master Cleanse, a crash diet trademarked by Peter Glickman, a man with no medical qualification, which involves consuming nothing but lemon juice, cayenne pepper, maple syrup and some powder from his website, for a minimum of 10 days. Glickman boasts that he frequently does it \"for up to 28 days\". There is no scientific evidence to suggest that living off lemon juice for a short month does you any good. There's a&#xa0;lot to suggest it's a really bad idea, but I did 14 days anyway, passing it off as a test of endurance. A tough way to kickstart my new fitness regime.</p> <p>And at the start, I&#xa0;believed myself. My plan was to drop a little bit of fat, just so the muscle underneath showed through. Skinny wasn't a word I used this time. It was a sensation I recognised, though, and it came around soon enough, bringing with it the tricksy, addictive confidence it had given me as a teenager. I&#xa0;steadily ate less and worked out more and told everyone, including myself, that I didn't know my body was shrinking so much.</p> <p>I started a new job a few months after that, in an agency that promised me more creative input and control. Once I got there, though, it turned out that that wasn't the case. The agency was run on a maxim of disempowerment, with every member of staff made to feel like a glorified intern, pitted against their colleagues. Months ran past with no personal achievements attached to them.</p> <p>I started to work out more than ever. I found excuses to go to the gym in the middle of the day, as well as in the morning and evening. I&#xa0;told people I was running so much because I&#xa0;was training for a marathon. Every time I&#xa0;went to the bathroom I would lift my shirt to look at my ribs. I'd take the lift alone, so I could look in its mirror to see how concave my stomach was. I'd jump on every set of scales I saw: in friends' bathrooms, in hotels, and in Boots, on the machine that gives you a print-out of your height, weight in kilograms and BMI.</p> <p>To begin with I was happy so long as that machine's prognosis was \"below average weight\", but I became addicted to seeing the numbers get lower. Each time they did, I&#xa0;shifted the parameters I set for myself. \"I'll be happy when I'm 60kg, 55, 50,\" and so on. \"If I have the discipline to drop another 2kg,\" I'd tell myself, \"I'll have the discipline to make anything work.\" It was as sensible as saying, \"If I can hold my breath underwater until I pass out, I'll have the discipline to never drown.\"</p> <p>I knew I was being irresponsible, but, thanks to the giddy effect starving can have on brain chemistry, I didn't think I was sick. Truth is, being skinny again felt awesome. Newly single, I relished the chance to show off my body as much as possible. Being very thin makes your dick look enormous, which I felt quite good about. It also, eventually, makes it stop working. When that happened, I just told myself I was going through a phase where I didn't much want to have sex.</p> <p>For months, I was dizzy every time I stood up. What was happening was that my heart was starting to pump blood less efficiently, but I told my doctor I thought I might have diabetes. She took a blood test and weighed me and said it must be stress, and that I was \"slightly underweight\". The fact that it was \"slight\" and not severe was terrible to me. I let my weight slide toward the 7st mark, then I did everything I could to hammer it down past it.</p> <p>In my job, I rarely had to wear a suit, so I&#xa0;could layer shirts and sweaters up. For a trip to Sweden for a conference, though, I packed trousers that I hadn't worn for a while. When I put them on, I found that I had shrunk so far that they looked like a paper bag belted to my waist. I had to rush out and buy new ones, which were hard to find so small, but I&#xa0;was thrilled with myself.</p> <p>On the penultimate night of that trip an older woman I worked with called me for a&#xa0;meeting in her room. \"You tell everyone you're training all the time, and I think they believe you,\" she said. \"I don't. Do you want to tell me about it?\" She listened for most of the night, first while I lied to her and then, after some kind persistence on her part, when I told the truth.</p> <p>I'd never spoken about it before and once I&#xa0;started I talked for hours. She told me a whole bunch of things she admired about me, reasons she thought I was worthy of being loved, and over the following weeks did everything she could to convince me she meant them, and wasn't just saying them for kindness' sake. Most of all, though, she told me I was a grown man now, and that the only person I had to be strong for was myself. She encouraged me to talk to friends and family back home, and did all she could to convince me they wouldn't abandon me if they saw I wasn't flawless and strong. She called me out on my crippling fear of being weak and unwell, then she promised me that she would never mention our conversation again.</p> <p>For me, that fear was based on the ghost of an idea that had taken hold of me 15 years before. For a lot of men with eating disorders it is a similar story: they are prevented from getting help by a fear of being weak, and of being perceived as freakish for suffering from what is largely considered to be a teenage girl's disease. Despite the fact the Royal College of Psychiatrists estimates that one in every 1,000 men suffers from an eating disorder, I have not met a single male sufferer (and over the past few years of recovering and trying to help others do so I've met many, of various ages, backgrounds and sexual orientations) who hasn't felt as if he was the only man in his position.</p> <p>To me, the key to beginning to feel OK was learning how to face up to that shame and to find genuine strength in accepting myself, learning to love myself and to let other people do the same. Learning, through difficult, honest conversations with therapists, family and friends that the world wasn't going to collapse if I wasn't its most disciplined citizen. That&#xa0;success is living a life where you&#xa0;can&#xa0;be&#xa0;happy with yourself, not just tougher than everyone else and that the strongest thing you can do, sometimes, is let other people give you a&#xa0;hand.</p> <p><em>The writer's name has been changed</em></p>",

  "<p>More than three-quarters of MPs believe the UK's drug policies are not working, according to a poll for a respected commission poised to deliver a landmark report assessing the evidence for continued prohibition.</p> <p>The poll's publication comes ahead of the release of several major reports into the future of UK drug policy that will ensure the debate about reforming the country's laws becomes a key issue for MPs for the rest of the year.</p> <p>The poll, conducted by ComRes for the <a href=\"http://www.ukdpc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Drug Policy Commission</a> (UKDPC), found that 77% of MPs believed the UK's current policies were ineffective in tackling the problems caused by illegal drugs.</p> <p>The poll of 150 MPs, weighted to reflect the composition of the Commons, found no significant difference between coalition and Labour MPs, with only 18% of MPs from coalition parties agreeing that current policies are working.</p> <p>It also revealed that MPs had deep concerns about how drug policy is formulated. Two-thirds of those polled said a change in how policy was made was needed to tackle the UK's drug problems effectively. More than three-quarters of the MPs said that drug policy needed to draw much more on evidence and research.</p> <p>\"We knew that the public think that drug policy isn't working well enough,\" said Roger Howard, chief executive of the UKDPC. \"Clearly, many MPs now also think the same. Drug policy in the UK has had some good achievements, like keeping HIV rates low among drug users and getting more people into treatment. But it's now clear to many people that we need some fresh thinking.\"</p> <p>The UKDPC, an independent body launched in April 2007, aims to provide independent and objective analysis of drug policy. It will be wound up in the autumn, when it will produce a comprehensive report examining the effects of current policy and make recommendations for the future.</p> <p>But while there is widespread agreement that existing laws are not working, the UKDPC poll suggests there is little consensus on what needs to be done. It found that most MPs would resist a change in the drug laws. According to the poll, only 31% believe that they should consider relaxing the law so that possession of small quantities of controlled drugs would not be treated as a criminal offence.</p> <p>Confusion about drugs policy has been reflected in ministerial appointments. Last week's reshuffle saw the government appoint its fourth drugs minister \u2013 Lord Taylor of Holbeach \u2013 in two years.</p> <p>Drugs experts said the poll highlighted the challenge now facing politicians. \"Transform is delighted to see that almost four out of five parliamentarians know that drug policy is failing,\" said Danny Kushlick of Transform, an anti-prohibition group. \"However, given that so few appear to know what to do about it, conducting a review of all options, including decriminalisation and legal regulation, would provide the evidence for parliament to pursue an effective approach.\"</p> <p>Growing disquiet among politicians about the UK's drugs laws reflects wider global unease about blanket prohibition. In February, 12 Latin American countries signed a declaration calling for world leaders to explore legal regulation.</p> <p>Earlier this year Guatemala's Otto P\u00e9rez Molina became the first serving Latin American president to push for drug legalisation. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/07/latin-america-drugs-nightmare\" title=\"\">Drug abuse, alcoholism and tobacco should be treated as public health problems, not criminal justice issues</a>,\" Molina said, writing in the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>The imminent publication of the UKDPC report and one by the Commons home affairs committee suggests a similar debate is now heading for the UK. The British Medical Association is also expected to publish a report on drug dependency.</p> <p>\"UKDPC will look at how we can tackle drug problems and get better value for public money when we publish our report next month on the future of drug policy,\" Howard pledged.</p> <p>The last home affairs committee report into drugs, published in 2002, called for a major shakeup of the government's policy, concentrating on education and harm reduction for users, rather than criminal sanctions. \"Drugs policy in this country has been failing for decades,\" David Cameron, who was then a committee member, declared at the time. \"Drug abuse has increased massively, the number of drug-related deaths has risen substantially and drug-related crime accounts for up to half of all acquisitive crime. I hope our report will encourage fresh thinking and a new approach.\"</p>",
  "<p>By now David Ayer knows this beat. He's patrolled cop fiction \u2013 at a clip (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89684/training.day\" title=\"\">Training Day</a> \u2013 2001) or a plod (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/123992/street.kings\" title=\"\">Street Kings</a> \u2013 2008) \u2013 for most of his career. End of Watch, another sun-blanched sweep through the hood with the writer/director's handsome, honest incarnation of the LAPD \u2013 is his best work yet: an all-out sprint around a very familiar block.</p> <p>Officers Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pe\u00f1a) patrol south central LA. They're cool cops \u2013 Oakley-sporting, born-with-the-badge police \u2013 respectful of the job, but not in thrall of it. Long hours in the cruiser, bickering and bantering, have formed a deep friendship. They've even, by prioritising the rule of the street over the book of law, earned the respect of some of the city's gangs. In one extraordinary scene, scrappy, stocky Zavala drops his gun and bare knuckle boxes a suspect into submission while Taylor looks on and laughs. This, according to Zavala's beaten opponent, is the mark of \"real police\".</p> <p>Life becomes more than routine when a traffic stop leads to the discovery of weapons and drug money linked to a Mexican cartel, and Taylor gets ideas above his payroll. He starts digging into gangster business, earning himself and Zavala a spot on their hit list. From there a policeman's life is rarely dull, with each house call paying out mountains of blinged-out munitions (including a gold jewel-encrusted assault rifle \u2013 \"Liberace's AK\") and a convenient lead to the next clue-crammed crime scene. There's little let-up, even when Zavala gets shot at. \"Are you OK partner?\" bellows Taylor. He is, he's fine \u2013 he doesn't need to drop in on the department's counsellor. There's no time anyway, because there's a lock-up full of trafficked immigrants to liberate on the next call.</p> <p>It should seem ludicrous, this top-heavy blend of action and drama, but Ayer whips us along, outpacing implausibility at every turn. It helps that Gyllenhaal and Pe\u00f1a are immediately likable as introspective Taylor and his bullish sidekick. Ayer's dialogue bolsters the quieter moments \u2013 a career-born hybrid of police code and street slang that's perfect for two regular cops shooting the breeze. On the sidelines stand Anna Kendrick and Natalie Martinez as Taylor's scientist girlfriend and Zavala's pregnant wife, but they're LAPD WAGs \u2013 on hand only to contextualise how strongly these family guys feel for each other.</p> <p>Ayer shoots in zippy style, switching between an in-car recorder reminiscent of pop cop TV, mini cameras attached to the actors' lapels and \u2013 somewhat improbably \u2013 a camcorder that Gyllenhaal's character has snuck past his superiors. There's a tangle in the narrative here: are we watching found footage or a glossy actioner? Ayer seems happy to settle for a bit of both. Taylor's camera is always on, always steady at the crucial moment \u2013 even in the fiercest of street fights.</p> <p>You could fill the charge sheet with such plausibility issues, yet End of Watch is a hard one to take down. The director has talked about the film as a thought-piece \u2013 a comment on inner-city communities forced to police violence with violence, but it's not to be taken that seriously. Switch on the siren, put the pedal to the floor. Revel in the pace and passion of a film-maker policing a field that is now unquestionably his.</p>",
  "<p>Two weeks before he was due to exchange contracts and move into a new home, Peter Gingell received a call from his estate agent saying the whole thing was off. His buyers had pulled out, his chain had collapsed and his dream home was just that. The reason? A 3cm-high weed in his back garden.</p> <p>\"When I was told, I thought it was a joke,\" says Gingell.</p> <p>However, this wasn't just any old weed; it was Japanese knotweed, described by the Environment Agency as \"indisputably the UK's most aggressive, destructive and invasive plant\".</p> <p>It can grow to 3-4m in just 10 weeks \u2013 the equivalent of two grown adults. Underground, its roots \u2013 or rhizomes \u2013 can spread 7m horizontally and compromise the structure of buildings.</p> <p>Jonathan Harris, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, acknowledges that the problem of securing mortgages on properties affected by the plant has escalated in recent years, despite the fact that it has been around in the UK since the 19th century.</p> <p>\"If a bank's valuer finds evidence of it, or there is a history of it in the area, a specialist survey will be required. Lenders can get quite hysterical and over-react. The bank may not lend, or may retain part of the loan.\"</p> <p>Mark Harris, chief executive of broker SPF Private Clients, says: \"It's a mixed bag. Woolwich, Santander and Leeds Building Society will decline mortgage applications on properties where Japanese knotweed is present, while others will consider it, with guarantees or an indemnity in place, and be guided by a surveyor, such as Northern Rock, Clydesdale and Nationwide.\"</p> <p>Yet, according to Richard Sexton, business development director of <a href=\"http://www.esurv.co.uk/\" title=\"\">e.surv</a>: \"No house in the UK has fallen down because of knotweed. Yes, it grows like billio and can exploit holes and cracks but there's an element of scare stories that has made the banks panic over the past two to three years. It's not that it's suddenly spreading more, but as awareness has risen, valuers report it more.\"</p> <p>He acknowledges a \"lack of clarity\", with some lenders wanting to know not just whether it's in the garden, but whether it's in the street or even the town. Lenders, he says, have panicked and, coupled with the economic climate, \"gone into risk-averse mode\".</p> <p>Soon after his buyer pulled out, Gingell carried out his own research and soon realised there are varying degrees of severity, in particular its proximity to properties. Although it's not easy, it can be treated. \"It seems so unfair that a lender has a blanket policy of saying 'no'. It's treatable, but they have rendered my property worthless overnight.\"</p> <p>He called in a specialist (it took both of them 20 minutes, on their hands and knees, to even locate the specimen) who reported: \"In my opinion, the knotweed offers no threat to the building or its foundations and, provided it is treated before it has a chance to spread further, it should be eradicated within two years.\"</p> <p>Gingell has been quoted \u00a3300 per treatment, carried out twice a year for the next two years. He warns against what was his initial temptation \u2013 ripping it out and binning it: \"You can face a massive fine or even imprisonment if it isn't disposed of at a landfill site, or incinerated. And if you don't do it properly, it will definitely come back.\" A fingernail-sized fragment is enough to grow into a whole new plant.</p> <p>Having lost his savings and, faced with a currently un-mortgageable flat, Gingell is keen to raise awareness of the issue, given estimates show at least one infestation in every 10 sq kms in the UK. He has launched a campaign on his website <a href=\"http://www.knotaware.com\">knotaware.com</a> urging banks to change their lending policy and adopt a grading system rather than simply saying no.</p> <p>The future looks more positive after a working party, including lenders, surveyors and knotweed treatment companies produced an information paper for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). It has the backing of the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Building Societies Association.</p> <p>\"It's the first step towards proper guidance for the market,\" says Philip Santo, director of Philip Santo and Company, which produced the paper on behalf of the RCIS in a bid \"to make properties mortgageable again\".</p> <p>Importantly, it sets out to distinguish myth from reality and addresses the need for surveyors to have a tier system to indicate the level of risk. It also looks at how the growing number of treatment companies could agree on the best methods of working.</p> <p>The Property Care Association now audits these firms and provides training.</p> <p>Mortgage advisers and surveyors admit it will probably take at least until the end of the year before the guidelines become more widely adopted. Santo says: \"It is early days in terms of all the banks coming on board, but if a lender declines an application, I strongly recommend people challenge them to see if the policy reflects the changes and recognised treatment regime set out in the RICS paper. I know of two cases where people have gone back and had the decision modified.\"</p> <h2>The lowdown on knotweed law</h2> <p>The Environment Agency describes Japanese knotweed as the most invasive species of plant in Britain. Landowners are under a statutory duty to be proactive in the control and eradication of it. All parts of the plant and any soil contaminated with it are classified as controlled waste and must be removed and disposed of by a licensed waste control operator. Here, Chris Alexander, a property litigation lawyer at SA Law outlines your legal rights:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 If you have Japanese knotweed on your land:</strong></p> <p>It is not an offence to have Japanese knotweed on your land and it is not a notifiable weed. However, under Section 14(1) and (2), of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is a criminal offence to plant Japanese knotweed or otherwise cause it to grow in the wild.</p> <p>It is a defence to a prosecution to prove that all reasonable steps were taken and all due diligence was exercised by the landowner.</p> <p>The removal, eradication and disposal of the weed may be expensive but given that the presence of it can impede the sale of your property and/or affect the value, a least-risk approach would be to have it removed by licensed contractors and properly disposed of.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 If your neighbour has Japanese knotweed on their land:</strong></p> <p>Again, it is not an offence for Japanese knotweed to be present on your neighbour's land but allowing it to encroach onto your property may constitute a private nuisance under common law.</p> <p>A landowner affected by knotweed growth from a neighbouring property may therefore be able to apply to court for an injunction requiring the neighbouring owner to abate the nuisance. Such a claim can also include a sum of money in damages to reflect the cost of any physical damage to the property and/or the diminution in value of the landowner's property as a result of the nuisance.</p> <p><em>\u2022 For information on the RICS Japanese knotweed and Residential Property paper go to <a href=\"http://www.rics.org.uk\">rics.org.uk</a>.

  "<p><strong>Catalan Dragons</strong> ended one of the most traumatic seasons in <strong>Bradford</strong>'s history as either Northern or the Bulls with a 50-26 victory in Perpignan that secured the French club's fourth place in the final Super League table and also guaranteed <strong>Wakefield Trinity</strong> a play-off place before they played their last match against <strong>Salford</strong>, which they won 42-34.</p> <p>The Bulls, who have been fighting for their future since April and only came out of administration last weekend, needed to win in France to preserve their chances of finishing above Trinity as a punishment for their financial mismanagement. Bradford started brightly to take a 10-0 lead despite the pre-match revelation that Craig Kopzcak, their highly-rated Wales prop, had terminated his own contract to engineer a likely move to Huddersfield. Even after the Dragons seemed to have taken control with a four-try burst, the battling Bulls came again as Jarrod Sammut completed a first-half hat-trick.</p> <p>But the Catalans dominated the second half, and their nine tries included a second consecutive hat-trick for Clint Greenshields. Victory means the Catalans have the dubious reward of a trip to <strong>Wigan</strong> in the first round of the play-offs on Friday, although finishing in the top four earns the Dragons a second chance, and a home match the following weekend, should they lose. Wakefield will take on reigning champions Leeds in the play\u2011offs in confident mood after posting a club record seventh-consecutive Super League win. The winger Ben Cockayne scored the 100th try of his career as the Wildcats put Salford to the sword.</p> <p><strong>Warrington</strong> will face <strong>St Helens</strong> on Saturday in the other qualifying play\u2011off, which Saints will approach with confidence after their win at Wigan on Friday. <strong>Leeds</strong>, who will now finish fifth whatever the result of their last league game at <strong>Huddersfield</strong> on Sunday, will play Wakefield at Headingley in the first of the elimination play-offs on Saturday night, with Hull taking on Huddersfield in the other the following day.</p> <p><strong>London Broncos</strong> removed any danger of finishing bottom of the table for the first time in their history with a 48-42 win against <strong>Hull KR</strong> in which Kieran Dixon, the young wing from Hemel Hempstead who has been called into the England Lions squad, scored two tries. Rangi Chase gave <strong>Castleford</strong>'s fans a brief reminder of what they may be losing out on next season but the England international's performance was not enough to stop <strong>Hull FC</strong> winning 36-10 at a canter.</p>",
  "<p>Lewis Hamilton should remain at McLaren, according to Sir Jackie Stewart. It is unlikely that Hamilton will seek out Stewart for wise words, but the three-times world champion, who also ran his own team, is one of the&#xa0;sages of the paddock and when it came to the major talking point in Monza&#xa0;\u2013 whether Hamilton should move to Mercedes or stay put \u2013 he made a great deal of sense.</p> <p>\"I personally would have stayed with McLaren,\" the Scot said. \"They have the resources and the money. They have the commitment and also have huge experience. He would not be here today without McLaren, so there is a degree of loyalty that I think you should always have. I don't think McLaren have been out of the top end of motor racing now for a very long time. Mercedes Benz is a wonderful company, but it would take a five\u2011minute meeting by the board to stop them being in the sport because of the economy and all the currency that is involved in the present time in Europe. So, if I was thinking long term, then I would be looking to stay at&#xa0;McLaren.\"</p> <p>Stewart's opinion is supported by another former British driver, Johnny Herbert, now a pundit with Sky Sports. \"I really don't know what he will do. I think he will stay, if I had to put money on it,\" he said. \"You have to ask what there is at Mercedes that would attract&#xa0;him, apart from the money, if that is the issue.</p> <p>\"I mean, Mercedes haven't really come on this year after winning in China. What is there about the team that could convince Lewis that he would have a better chance of winning titles there?</p> <p>\"McLaren, on the other hand, have proved that they can develop a car during the season, as Red Bull have.&#xa0;And McLaren have done it year in, year out. They have an outstanding record in terms of the development of their car.\"</p> <p>It is not difficult to imagine Hamilton's head being turned by Mercedes \u2013 and not just for the money. The move would give him more control of his sponsorship deals and he would be with a company that is expected to do well when the regulations are overhauled in 2014.</p> <p>It is also the sort of big-money deal that is right up the brightly coloured street of his agents, XIX Entertainment, who thrive on business such as this.</p> <p>The future of the McLaren team is also less than certain, with speculation that their main sponsors, Vodafone, may leave and with a new engine deal with Mercedes starting next year.</p> <p>Stewart, however, feels that Hamilton might take time to bed down with Mercedes. \"He has been [at&#xa0;McLaren] for six years now. There is a risk that when you go to a new team it can take you 24 months to settle down,\" he said. \"You have to get used to new engineers, new management, new cultures, new ways of doing things.&#xa0;He might immediately dial in and get it done, but I sometimes think the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know.</p> <p>\"I have not seen McLaren do anything wrong in terms of their culture and their performance. They have got fantastic facilities. You could go to a new team who might give you a regeneration, but he is one of the fastest drivers in the world.\"</p> <p>When asked whether Hamilton appreciated the position he is in at McLaren, Stewart said: \"Probably not because he has had it since his karting days because Ron [Dennis] gave him that beginning. I remember giving him a trophy at the RAC Club in Pall Mall and he was a wee boy of eight years in a black velvet dinner suit.</p> <p>\"Someone said to me: 'He is going to be bright for the future,' but he has been a big player in the sport and made a huge amount of money and that is largely down to McLaren not to Lewis.</p> <p>\"They were the ones who gave him the break and they have made him the driver he is. He's a very lucky boy. He's made huge amounts of money and that's only a tiny part of it. After you make a certain amount of money you are not going to make a lot more or less whether you go to one team or another. In fact, money is nothing to do with it.\"</p> <p>Money, however, is a factor, and McLaren may have to move their position if they are to keep their star&#xa0;driver.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Paul di Resta, a leading candidate to replace Hamilton at McLaren if the move does go ahead, has joined up with the Sports Partnership, who manage Button's affairs. The Force India driver said: \"It's no secret that I have been looking for new representation and I am delighted to have found this with the Sports Partnership. They've been assisting me in a purely advisory capacity while I've been making my decision.\"</p>",

If you had to imagine what a teenage computer hacker would look like, this was it.</p> <p>The episode was front-page news on websites across the world, as a string of arrests were made: 19-year-old Ryan Cleary from Essex; 16-year-old Tflow from London; 27-year-old Jeremy Hammond from Chicago; a 25-year-old former soldier, Ryan Ackroyd, from Doncaster; 19-year-old Darren Martyn (or PwnSauce), from Galway, and Donncha O'Cearrbhail (or Palladium), also 19 and from Offaly, Ireland. The most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/29/lulzsec-hacker-arrest-sony-attack\" title=\"\">recent arrest</a>, 12 days ago, was of another American, 20-year-old Raynaldo Rivera of Arizona.</p> <p>In March this year came the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/06/lulzsec-sabu-working-for-us-fbi\" title=\"\">news of how it happened</a>: the FBI had turned a LulzSec member in New York, a 28-year-old Puerto Rican father of two called Hector Xavier Monsegur, known online as \"Sabu\", and used him as their informant. It was like <em>The Sopranos</em>, but instead of organised crime and Italian hitmen it involved teenagers sitting at computer screens. And perhaps most confusing of all, the vast majority of the main players seemed to be living in Britain or Ireland.</p> <p>Gabriella Coleman, professor of scientific and technological literacy at McGill University, in Montreal, probably knows more about Anonymous than anybody on the planet. She has studied them from the moment they first emerged as a new political force in 2008, and says that it's no coincidence that so many of the arrests were of British and Irish nationals. Anonymous is a vast, new, poorly understood global force who specialise in \"ultra-co-ordinated motherfuckery\", as one of Coleman's contacts puts it. And it attracts a huge British following.</p> <p>In the chatrooms where Anons gather, Parmy Olson, a London-based journalist with <em>Forbes</em> magazine, found the British connection blindingly obvious. Her book, <em>We Are Anonymous: Inside the Hacker World of LulzSec, Anonymous, and the Global Cyber Insurgency</em>, published in America this June, offers a brilliant insight into the hacktivists' world. Almost by accident, Olson charted the emergence and domination of LulzSec, following the twists and turns of the story as it happened. \"And,\" she says, \"you could just see a lot of people talking about British things, British television shows, they were speaking with English spellings. You could tell they were British.\"</p> <p>Olson met Jake Davis before he reverted to Jake Davis \u2013 when he was still Topiary \u2013 in the Shetlands. \"It took a day and a half just to get there,\" she says. \"And it was embarrassing really. He was one of the most wanted hackers on the planet, and he just seemed so young.\"</p> <p>A year is a long time, though, when you're 18. I'd been expecting a socially awkward geek, but Davis turns out to be open-faced, chatty, good at eye contact and not geeky at all, though this may have something to do with the fact that he hasn't been allowed access to the internet for more than 12 months. He's pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer misuse under the Computer Misuse Act and is back in court in April next year. He's also waiting to see if he'll stand trial on another charge: conspiracy to commit fraud (the CPS is currently assessing whether a trial is in the public interest, given that he's already pleaded guilty to the first charge). He's currently at liberty on condition that he wears an electronic tag, is home by 10pm, and lives with his mum (who moved to Spalding shortly before his arrest).</p> <p>And that he goes nowhere near the internet. His only means of communicating with the outside world is a mobile phone that looks like it was a recent model circa 1995. And the greatest surprise \u2013 not just to me, but to him \u2013 is that he's barely missing the internet at all. \"I actually feel a lot better within myself. My life was the internet, pretty much. It was chatting on the internet and amassing groups of friends. And I had no life outside it. A year ago I would just be head-down kind of walking along, mumbling monosyllabically.\"</p> <p>It's that lack of contact with the outside world that has led Jake Davis to me. He helped Parmy Olson with her book, and he seems keen to have some form of communication with the outside world. Because communicating was both his speciality and what got him into this mess in the first place.</p> <p>\"Living in the Shetlands, I didn't understand the impact of what we were doing,\" he says. \"I didn't understand the impact on the real world. And now that I'm here in Spalding, and I've been a lot in London, I kind of see that the world does go round and it's not about hiding in a bedroom.\"</p> <p>What seems incredible, even now (and maybe, especially, to Jake), is how a slightly troubled teenager living on the two-sheep island of Yell, in the Shetland Isles \u2013 a place as isolated and remote as anywhere on Earth \u2013 came to find himself at the heart of a radical global political movement.</p> <p>But then, maybe that's the point. When I met Gabriella Coleman in Edinburgh she'd spent the previous evening meeting one of her contacts, who lived in a remote croft in the Scottish countryside. \"He cooked me pheasant,\" she said. Olson, too, found that a disproportionate number of contacts she met \"lived in out-of-the-way places\".</p> <p>For Jake, living in the Shetlands, the internet became his everything. It was where he made friends and socialised. \"It's where I learned almost everything I now know. The thing I miss the most is Wikipedia. I mean, at school I learned to knit. I'm actually a pretty good knitter now.\" Jake had a somewhat difficult childhood, and that (combined with the knitting lessons) led him to drop out of school at 13, shortly after his stepfather was killed in an accident.</p> <p>What's surprising, at first, is that he's not unhappy that he was caught, or that he faces the prospect of several years in prison. \"People say that prison is bad, but I lived in my bedroom with a computer for years. It's not going to be as bad as that. I just want to go and do my sentence and get my education in there. I want to get a really good education and just read loads of books.\"</p> <p>That's if he doesn't get extradited \u2013 because he's been charged in America, too, where his fellow hackers are facing up to 20 years inside. By contrast, in Ireland no charges have been brought against the arrested hackers. Anonymous may be an international phenomenon but there's no consensus (yet) on how to police the internet.</p> <p>What's immediately apparent about Jake Davis (and about a lot of the people involved with Anonymous) is just how bright and intelligent he is. And how the internet is where they find an outlet for their intellect \u2013 an outlet that somehow seems to have eluded them in real life. \"These weren't just normal individuals who found themselves in extraordinary circumstances,\" says Parmy Olson. \"They really were extraordinary individuals in extraordinary circumstances.\"</p> <p>What I find so interesting about Davis is how completely he seems to have been let down by the education system. It entirely failed to uncover or nurture his talents. \"I literally have not a single qualification to my name,\" he tells me at one point, and looks rather sheepish. Davis rose to prominence in Anonymous and then LulzSec not because he was some expert hacker \u2013 he wasn't; his technical skills were limited \u2013 but because he is a naturally gifted writer and communicator. Among other things, he controlled the LulzSec Twitter account, from which issued forth a stream of jokey pronouncements, the last of which had the feeling of prophecy to it: \"You cannot arrest an idea,\" he said. Which may be true, but almost exactly a month later a team of police officers burst into his living room, and then flew him by specially chartered plane to London, a place he'd never been to before. \"It was like going to the future or something,\" he says.</p> <p>You can't arrest an idea, though. And although Anonymous's impact may have been exaggerated (not least by itself), at its heart is a radical idea: that the internet can enable mass, participatory, possibly illegal action in a way the world has never seen before. Actions that can be controlled by neither governments nor international agencies, and which are decided by the horde, enacted by the horde, and policed by the horde.</p> <p>According to Parmy Olson, the \"hivemind\", or getting people to \"believe in the power\" of the hivemind, is probably Anonymous's greatest achievement. There is no central organisation (though there are organisers) and no official membership. In some ways it resembles that other recent un-organisation, al-Qaida. If you believe in Anonymous, and call yourself Anonymous, you are Anonymous.</p> <p>And in 2008, it seemingly came out of nowhere. At the time, Gabriella Coleman was studying the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TuhOiwGzeg\" title=\"\">Open Source community</a> (the network of programmers who believe in, and develop, free software open to all) and was based at the University of Alberta, which happened to have the largest Scientology archive in the world. And she couldn't help but notice what happened when a video of Tom Cruise being interviewed about Scientology appeared on the internet. A group of online hackers began \"trolling\" (mocking; trying to get a rise out of) the Church of Scientology. For a lot of people, the video \u2013 meant for internal PR purposes only within the church \u2013 was provocation enough: Cruise appears as a genuine, bona fide, swivel-eyed religious nutcase. Then things escalated. The church began <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/17-10/mf_chanology?currentPage=all\" title=\"\">issuing legal threats</a> against the sites hosting the video, and it was this attempt to police the internet that prompted certain people to rise up and try to defend it.</p> <p>\"What I realised,\" says Coleman, \"is that the Church of Scientology was like the perfect nemesis. It was the geeks' worst nightmare, because it is a religion of science and technology, but the technology doesn't work and the science is pseudoscience. And it's an extremely proprietary religion: they have very aggressive control over trademarks and copyright, so in every way it seemed like the hackers saw how the church was like them, but their evil twin.\"</p> <p>And in doing so, they also realised that they possessed a hitherto unrealised power: strength in numbers. Instead of merely staging online protests, a day of global protest was organised. And on 10 February 2008, 7,000 people <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SraUpcJfqw\" title=\"\">showed up</a> in 127 cities around the world. They didn't know it then but a new political movement was born. \"We are Anonymous,\" read one of the flyers. \"We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.\"</p> <p>Talking to Coleman and Olson, I think I'm getting a handle on Anonymous, and what it is and what it has done. And then I start going into Anonymous chatrooms, on IRC (internet relay chat), on the so-called \"deep web\", a place unsearchable by Google. And I realise I don't understand a thing. People just seem to be talking about random crap in acronyms I don't understand. It's confusingly chaotic. There are people entering the room every five seconds, people leaving, people changing their nicknames. And then there's the slang. Everyone is a fag: there are newfags (newcomers) and oldfags (old-timers) and fagfags (homosexuals) and moralfags (those perceived as taking the moral high ground). I realise that I am a newsfag. But I can't spot the plans to conquer the universe between the casual misogynism and the Aids jokes.</p> <p>It's only on the reporter channel that I find people who can type in sentences and speak a language that I recognise as English. It's where self-selected Anons interact with the press and explain Anonymous's objectives. A 17-year-old called The_Poet, who tells me he's of Iranian parentage, says he became involved because of <a href=\"http://memeburn.com/2011/05/operation-iran-anonymous-does-not-forgive/\" title=\"\">Operation Iran</a> (or OpIran as it's known, Anonymous's campaign to help activists in Iran following the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009). He wanted to feel that he was doing something to help activists there. He's at school, he says, and he was about as computer-savvy as I am when he found the forum (ie, not very) but now he spends up to five or more hours a day on it. We chat away, and he tells me that having helped draft press releases and the like, and having become interested in world affairs, he's now considering diplomacy as a career. Though saying you're in Anonymous is possibly not the most obvious CV-building step, I venture.</p> <p>It's late when we chat, around 1am UK time, and it's obvious he's in Europe somewhere, and it's school the next day. \"Go to bed,\" I keep telling him. And I can't help but feel relieved when he tells me that he hasn't done anything illegal. Because via the encrypted chat protocol, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2002/aug/31/outwithaolin\" title=\"\">Jabber</a> (the first step to communicating with anyone in Anon world), I have chatted to another teenage Anon who was arrested, but never charged. He was lucky. \"I was immature and stupid and reckless,\" he says. \"I caused a lot of damage. Hurt a <em>lot</em> of innocent people. I put millions of people at risk of identity theft by leaking their passwords. It is never justified. Never.\"</p> <p>But you did it because\u2026?</p> <p>\"At the time, it seemed great fun.\"</p> <p>Because fun is the bedrock of it all. \"Trolling\". Agitating. Taking the piss. Lying to, manipulating and taking in fellow internet users. Making a joke of everything. Jake suspects it's why it's so big in Britain. \"Anon humour is quite dark and ironic and is pretty similiar to British humour,\" he says. The origin of \"lulz\" is a corruption of LOLs, meaning \"laugh out loud\" (and not \"lots of love\", as David Cameron thought when he put LOL at the end of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/11/rebekah-brooks-david-cameron-texts-lol\" title=\"\">a text to Rebekah Brooks</a>).</p> <p>It's all about the lulz. On 4chan, the \"image board\" (like a chat board, but where people came initially to share images, and whose /b/ \u2013 or \"random\" \u2013 board spawned the idea of Anonymous), anything goes. Just so long as it's not taken seriously. In fact, 4chan is the originator of hundreds of internet memes and viral videos, many of which have found their way into mainstream media.</p> <p>It's easy to grow paranoid researching an article on Anonymous. Some terrible things have happened to people who have tangled with them. LulzSec's first collective action was against Aaron Barr, the CEO of an internet security firm, HBGary Inc, who claimed to have penetrated Anonymous and worked out who the central players were. To cut a long story short, he hadn't. LulzSec cracked his email password, downloaded 40,000 of his emails and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/writer/parmy_olson/\" title=\"\">released them</a> in a torrent online for anyone to read.</p> <p>Soon after I start hanging out in Anonymous chatrooms, my computer starts running slowly. My phone starts glitching. I start waking in the night with paranoid dreams. Quinn Norton, a reporter for <em>Wired</em> magazine, tells me that there is a strong culture within the group of not attacking the press. Even so, she suspects there may be a \"cache of [my] documents somewhere, but they're not doing anything bad with them\". The main thing to bear in mind if writing about them, she says, is \"not to be an asshole\".</p> <p>I tell Jake about my paranoia. \"I had that every day,\" he says. \"Every morning I spent an hour doing searches and running certain scripts to make me feel better.\" But in his case, at least, it comes down to the old truism that just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean that there isn't someone following you.</p> <p>When Sabu, the Anonymous turncoat, was intercepted by the FBI, he disappeared offline for 24 hours, and when he came back his story didn't quite hang together. \"I was completely suspicious of him,\" says Jake. \"I was just too stupid to do anything about it. The idea that there was a group of Feds out to get me is the kind of stuff that happens in films. And I'm from the Shetland Islands. The FBI aren't going to be using one of my friends to spy on me. That happens in American action films, it is not real life. And it turns out that this is exactly what happened.\"</p> <p>It was even stranger in some ways for Gabriella Coleman. She met Sabu in New York before any of the arrests, and immediately became suspicious of his status and motives. \"I just knew,\" she says. \"There was no way while he was still the world's most wanted hacker that he'd be wanting to meet me unless he'd been arrested. I knew he'd been arrested. But of course, I couldn't tell anyone. And that was really hard.\"</p> <p>As an anthropologist studying Anonymous, at times, she says, she felt like a cross between \"a detective and a priest\". She watched the group take shape from the time of the Scientology uprising, and was online, in the chatrooms, at the moment it hit the big time: WikiLeaks.</p> <p>Julian Assange had just released the US <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-us-embassy-cables\" title=\"\">diplomatic cables</a>, PayPal had announced that it would no longer accept donations on Wikileaks' behalf, and the internet was in uproar. \"There were 7,000 people a time logging into the channels [chat rooms] when, usually, at the very most there would be 1,000,\" says Coleman. \"More than 35,000 people downloaded the software.\"</p> <p>\"The software\" was something called low orbit ion cannon (LOIC), and it meant that anyone with a few clicks of a mouse could become a \"hacker\", or at least a website attacker. Computers all over the world started sending packets of information to the PayPal and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/08/operation-payback-mastercard-website-wikileaks\" title=\"\">Visa</a> websites, flooding its servers with a DDoS attack (distributed denial of service). In her book, Parmy Olson explains what actually happened. The PayPal and Visa websites were attacked successfully, but the main perpetrators weren't the \"hive\": the real firepower came from a couple of individuals with \"botnets\", illegal networks of compromised computers. Olson suggests the hive was a PR myth.</p> <p>Still, it's a dangerous PR myth. A few months after the attacks, the FBI began to arrest people: people who had been drawn into Anonymous by the rhetoric, and either didn't realise that what they were doing was illegal, didn't have enough technical nous to cover their tracks, or simply didn't care. There were students, middle-class professionals\u2026 Anonymous wasn't just \"the stereotypical kids living in their mum's basement\", as Coleman puts it. \"You'll probably find at least a couple in your IT department.\"</p> <p>But when you look, for example, at the stunning visual nature of some of Anonymous's designs, that shouldn't come as too great a shock. Nor the brilliance of its operations in <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/01/26/egypt-versus-the-internet-anonymous-hackers-launch-ddos-attack/\" title=\"\">Egypt</a> and <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/01/03/pro-wikileaks-hackers-tunisian-government-websites/\" title=\"\">Tunisia</a>, and recently in <a href=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/327979\" title=\"\">Syria</a>. At its most powerful and compelling, it has leaped to the defence of the internet itself. It was only when Anonymous started highlighting what was happening in Tunisia, for example, after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/17/arab-governments-silenced-wikileaks\" title=\"\">government banned Wikileaks</a> in late 2010, that the rest of the world's press started paying attention to what became the Arab spring.</p> <p>It is \"political art as spectacle\", according to Coleman. And it stands in opposition to almost everything mainstream society holds dear. Individual fame is neither sought nor welcomed. Anons who draw attention to themselves or claim to speak for Anonymous are ostracised. \"It's almost like the polar opposite of everything that social media stands for,\" says Coleman. \"They dramatise the importance of anonymity and privacy in an era when both are rapidly eroding. They are the anti-Facebook.\"</p> <p>Being anonymous was the source of Jake's power: no one knew he was a kid. That, and the idea of the hive. \"Everyone secretly knows that everyone else [in Anonymous] is kind of a lonely, geeky guy,\" says Jake. \"But we all ignore it, and we all play this Anon game where we are all these invincible Anons.\"</p> <p>And they were mostly guys. Anonymous is very male. In the <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rules-of-the-internet\" title=\"\">Rules of the Internet</a>, which came out of the 4chan site, Rule 30 states \"there are no girls on the internet\". The previous rule states that \"all girls are men and all kids are undercover FBI agents\", which contains a grain of truth.</p> <p>At times it seems like Anonymous is a nest of slightly naive teenagers who are going to get into trouble. Teenagers have always acted out. Now they get to act out on a global stage, where just a few clicks of a mouse could lead to them spending the next 20 years behind bars. It's impossible to generalise, however. One figure behind one of the most popular Anonymous Twitter feeds told Coleman that he is a \"member of the 1 per cent\". \"He's always in Paris on vacation,\" she tells me. \"He's a very, very wealthy engineer and he's extremely careful in concealing his identity.\"</p> <p>And on the #reporter channel, I chat for a while to an Anon called \"nsh\", who tells me that what we're witnessing is \"the emergence of a new kind of identity, and with it a new form of identity politics. Traditional politics caters to fixed demographics, requires that participants have continuity of identity, can be located in geography. These are things that can be dispensed [with] online, and have been, with great effect.\"</p> <p>He's a bit fond of his long words, nsh, and he likes his historical analogies. The random attacks on websites are really the contemporary version of writing a political slogan on a wall, he says. It's like online vandalism. \"But the Vandals,\" he writes, \"got the short stick, historically, didn't they?\" He won't tell me anything about himself, but my guess is he's British and studying at one of our better universities. It's probably not a coincidence that both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/29/assange-supporters-claim-hacked-cambridge\" title=\"\">Cambridge</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/oxford-university-security-anonymous-hack-90815\" title=\"\">Oxford</a> universities have been targeted in the past two weeks, as part of Anonymous's ongoing Operation Free Assange. If you're going to spray-paint a wall, you might as well do it somewhere your mates will see it. I like joshing with nsh, but I do feel the generational difference. When he makes a joke, he signals it with an emoticon. When I make a joke, he says \"lol\". I have to say, \"Ha, ha!\" because otherwise, I tell him, \"I'll sound like Ali G. It'd be embarrassing. Like hearing your gran try to rap.\"</p> <p>There is \"no clear-cut moral assessment\" of Anonymous that can be made, says Gabriella Coleman. \"But if you hurt the internet, be careful, because the internet may well hurt you back.\"</p> <p>In Spalding, Jake Davis can make even less sense of it, even though, for a time, he was it. His lawyers have made him read<strong> </strong>hundreds of pages of his chat logs as part of his case. \"And I just think 'Who is this Topiary guy?'\" he says. \"He is just full of crap. We tried to do something funny, something political, something ideological, and it ended up just being a mess.\"</p> <p>I'm possibly more confused about Anonymous now than when I started researching this article. When I look at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-17544311\" title=\"\">pastebin.com</a>, which is where hackers put up the latest data dumps, the results of their latest hacking and defacement operations, the targets seem random, perverse.</p> <p>\"Cadwal, there is always mad shit going on in Anonymous,\" an Anon called KnowledgeUS tells me. \"It is even hard for an Anon to know all that's going on with Anonymous.\"</p> <p>It makes me feel a little better. \"Ha, ha!\" I say. Because Anonymous is something that belongs to a new generation. It's their internet. Their Anonymous. And at my age, I'm just too old for the lulz.</p> <p><em>This piece was edited on 2/10/12 to clarify a contributor's quote</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Dear Owen</strong></p> <p>Welcome to your new job as secretary of state for the environment. I predict an interesting spell in office \u2013 for you certainly come with unusual credentials. You have virtually no record of making environmental pronouncements of any consequence or for showing concerns about ecological or climatic issues. You say you loathe wind turbines, a source of renewable energy on which Britain was supposed to be becoming reliant, while it is also said that you are a proponent of fracking, the extraction of shale gas, a process that would cause major increases in UK carbon emissions.</p> <p>For good measure you arrive at your new post with the strong endorsement of Britain's chief climate change denier, Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor who now believes his legacy of laissez-faire economics is being undermined by unnecessary curbs to carbon emissions and who has committed himself to the obstruction of such reforms.</p> <p>It is quite a CV, and you can appreciate why those concerned with scientific issues might be worried. Apart from your own dubious record, several other individuals given cabinet posts last week have also voiced startling, unorthodox views.</p> <p>The new transport minister, Patrick McLoughlin, has revealed he has a morbid fear of flying, for example, while the new health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, turns out to be a supporter of homeopathy, a widely discredited, ineffective form of treatment derided by the medical establishment. Putting such individuals in office is the equivalent of putting <em>Twilight</em>'s Cullen clan of vampires in charge of a blood bank. Certainly the chance of rational, evidence-based debate in cabinet looks a remote prospect these days.</p> <p>Hence my letter to you, Mr Paterson. In taking charge of UK environmental affairs, you have been handed a task that has never been more important. It needs to be directed with pressing urgency: ice sheets are melting, sea levels rising and farmland is turning to desert across the globe as temperatures rise.</p> <p>Hundreds of millions of people are destined to lose their homes in the next few decades unless we take action now. Britain, which gave birth to the industrial revolution and which became the first country to pump significant excesses of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, has a special responsibility to the world. If nothing else, we need to set an example and end our reliance on the burning of fossil fuels to generate power.</p> <p>And that is what worries me about your appointment. By all accounts you are a charming, pro-foxhunting, country gentleman who has an intense love of his North Shropshire constituency but who has yet to demonstrate any recognition of the global nature of the environmental crisis we face (though I acknowledge your 2010 green paper on fisheries management reveals an appreciation of the current crises affecting the oceans). Humanity is now going through the latter stages of an experiment far greater than the hunt for the Higgs boson or the decoding of the human genome. As we pump more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, thereby melting ice caps, destroying precious ecosystems and eradicating species in their thousands, we are creating a future for ourselves that becomes less and less certain and more and more hostile.</p> <p>Now it is true that Britain may avoid some of the very worst direct impacts of this grand experiment when \u2013 later this century \u2013 global average temperatures rise by at least 3C to 6C, but we will not escape the secondary consequences. As central Europe and much of Asia scorches, millions of starving people will reach our shores. Our country will be turned into a military outpost dedicated to keeping them out, a point recently raised by Professor Stephen Emmott, who has observed that senior army officers have recently become a common sight at climate conferences. If nothing else, this suggests that the military sees the dangers we face, even if politicians like you do not.</p> <p>In short, you need to see the big picture. My fear is that you were picked because that is the last thing you do. Your appointment is part of George Osborne's bid to bring short-term boosts to the economy at the expense of long-term environmental gain and in the face of opposition from government climate advisers. Let us bring back fossil fuels, in particular gas, as our main power source and curtail renewable energy sources, argues the chancellor, who has succeeded in persuading the prime minister to pack the cabinet with environmental sceptics, utterly undermining David Cameron's declared hope his government would be the greenest ever seen in Britain.</p> <p>I hope you have the courage to confound those expectations and to realise that we face a catastrophic future if we do not halt our dependence on fossil fuels. Fracking is not an answer to our problems, nor is the new dash for gas, backed by Osborne. The latter would leave us dependent on natural gas producers such as Qatar and at the mercy of major price rises that would be introduced in later years.</p> <p>By contrast, creating an indigenous renewable power industry in Britain \u2013 for wind, wave and tidal turbines \u2013 will give us energy independence and wean us off our fossil fuel habits. That is the longer-term, bigger picture. I hope you see it, but I doubt you do.</p> <p>My unease is only deepened by the knowledge that you are the brother-in-law of the environmental sceptic Matt Ridley, whose stewardship at Northern Rock saw the first run on a British bank for 150 years but who has never tired of telling us that climatewise we have nothing to fear.</p> <p>Nor have your actions since taking office done anything to soothe jangled nerves. Pressed last week by journalists to deny or admit you are a climate change sceptic, you hid behind a feeble Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs press release that merely acknowledged that you were responsible for exploring issues such as climate change.</p> <p>It was an unimpressive start. I would like to think that things can only get better. Given a pause for reflection about the wider issues, that could happen. I hope you do get the bigger picture. If you do not, then the nation will have wasted further precious time when it could be taking decisive action to counter climate change. And time is a commodity that is already in dangerously short supply.</p> <p><strong>Yours, Robin</strong></p>",
  "<p>From Epsom to the far east, Snow Fairy's ability to change gear in the closing stages of a race has made her one of the most impressive money earners ever trained in a British stable, and her success in the Irish Champion Stakes here on Saturday proved that she is one of the most durable too. Late last year, Ed Dunlop's mare suffered a leg injury that might have ended her career, but Snow Fairy has now won seven times at the highest level and her finishing speed in Leopardstown's short home straight was as irresistible as ever.</p> <p>The pace was strong from the off as Daddy Long Legs, the UAE Derby winner earlier in the year, led the field through the first mile, but he dropped away as Nathaniel, the Eclipse winner, struck for home under William Buick. At Sandown, Nathaniel had fought off a series of challenges, but now, just one was too much for him as Snow Fairy and Frankie Dettori quickened into a decisive lead in scarcely a dozen strides.</p> <p>Snow Fairy has now won more than \u00a34m in her career in prize money, as well as a bonus of nearly \u00a3700,000 for a victory in Japan in 2010. As a result of her injury, which kept her off the track until a Group One success at Deauville last month, she is also a fresh horse just as the Flat season starts to approach its lucrative climax.</p> <p>\"I've not had many prouder moments,\" Dunlop said. \"I've been lucky enough to win a few good races, but to do what she's just done is amazing. Frankie gave her a great ride. She's got an electric turn of foot and we wanted to take our time a bit. She's now won a Group One in Europe against colts after being second in this last year \u2013 she is the horse of a lifetime.</p> <p>\"It has been a huge team effort with her. She seems to be a better horse this year, I don't know why, but she's unbelievable. It would have been very easy to retire her, but her owner was very keen on keeping her racing and it's&#xa0;worked.</p> <p>\"She seems fine after her injury, but we need to take it a race at her time. I'd like to go to the Breeders' Cup with her, she's in the Arc and also the Champion Stakes [at Ascot], but there's also a horse called Frankel in that one.\"</p> <p>Snow Fairy is 8-1 (from 10-1) for the Arc with Paddy Power, and 2-1 (from 5-2) with Hills for the Breeders' Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf. Nathaniel is unchanged at 7-1 for the Arc with Paddy Power.</p> <p>Sir Henry Cecil recorded a rare Group One success in Ireland via the stewards' room after Chachamaidee was awarded the Matron Stakes having crossed the line a short-head behind Duntle, who was demoted to second.</p> <p>The race itself was suitably dramatic, as Wayne Lordan pushed Duntle through a narrow gap inside the final furlong and then held off the late charge of Chachamaidee and Tom Queally, with Emulous, the favourite, just half a length away in third. It then took the stewards more than 20 minutes to decide that the placings of the first two home should be&#xa0;reversed.</p> <p>Finishes such as this are a familiar sight at Leopardstown, where the short run-in on the home straight gives jockeys little time for thought or manoeuvre. Even so, it was difficult to argue that the result was certainly affected, and Duntle, a Group Three winner last time out, seemed a little unfortunate not to get off the mark at Group One level at the first time of asking.</p> <p>The result of the inquiry was disappointing for David Wachman, Duntle's trainer, who is also the son-in-law of John Magnier, the owner of Coolmore Stud, which sponsors the Matron Stakes. Few top races in Ireland do not provide some good news for Magnier and Coolmore one way or another, however, and Chachamaidee's success was a first at Group One level for her sire, Footstepsinthesand, one of the up-and-coming stallions on Coolmore's roster.</p>",
  "<p>Pressure is mounting on the highest ranking US catholic official yet to be convicted of covering up clerical child sex abuse to resign from the church.</p> <p>Bishop Robert Finn was found guilty Friday of failing to report suspected child sexual abuse to authorities, prompting calls for him to step down or be booted from office.</p> <p>Advocates for the victims of clerical sex abuse have challenged the Vatican directly, calling on the Pope to step in and dismiss Finn from his position as bishop of the diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph.</p> <p>But despite a growing campaign to force his ouster, church officials have maintained that he isn't going anywhere \u2013 despite the conviction.</p> <p>\"The bishop looks forward to continuing to perform his duties, including carrying out the important obligations placed on him by the court,\" diocese spokesman Jack Smith said in a statement.</p> <p>That message comes despite some Roman Catholics pushing for a resignation, with some church members launching a Facebook page titled \"Bishop Finn Must Go.\"</p> <p>Among the posts was one that listed contact information for the Vatican and urged parishioners to voice their displeasure with Finn at the highest levels.</p> <p>Pope Benedict XVI alone has authority over bishops. Through the decades-long abuse scandal, only one US bishop has stepped down over his failures to stop abusive clergy: Cardinal Bernard Law, who in 2002 resigned as head of the Archdiocese of Boston.</p> <p>Finn was sentenced Friday to two years of supervised probation in relationship to the hushing up of suspicious activities by Reverend Shawn Ratigan.</p> <p>The bishop failed to respond to warnings the diocese received from a parish elementary school principal detailing suspicious behaviour by Ratigan around children.</p> <p>Instead of reading the memo and looking into the claims, Finn left it up to subordinates to handle the matter. It took a year before he finally read a five-page document from the school head.</p> <p>Finn was also aware of nude photos of children found on Ratigan's laptop computer in December 2010. But still the bishop failed to act. Instead of turning them over to police, Finn sent Ratigan to live at a Missouri convent.</p> <p>Authorities were eventually handed the photos in May 2011 by Monsignor Robert Murphy - against Finn's wishes, according to court documents - after Ratigan continued to violate church orders to stay away from children and not take any pictures of them.</p> <p>Ratigan pleaded guilty last month to five child pornography counts, but has yet to be sentenced. Prosecutors have requested he spend the rest of his life in prison.</p> <p>In court on Friday, Finn apologised for the pain his failure to report Ratigan caused.</p> <p>But for many, the only course open for the bishop is for him to step down.</p> <p>\"Now that our justice system says he's guilty, he has lost his ability to lead our diocese,\" Patricia Rotert, a Catholic church member in Kansas City, said Friday. \"He's lost his credibility. There is turmoil and angst around him and I don't think he can bring people together.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, advocacy group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) called on Pope Benedict to intervene.</p> <p>In a letter to the Pontiff, SNAP director David Clohessy wrote: \"Now, for the first time in US history, you have a diocese headed by a proven criminal. You must act if you are serious about making the church safer for children, discouraging future cover-ups in child sex cases, and ameliorating the wounds of tens of thousands of suffering adult victims and millions of betrayed parishioners.\"</p> <p>Dismissing Finn would \"strongly deter other church officials from acting recklessly, callously and deceitfully in other child sex cases\", Clohessy added.</p> <p>Finn's conviction comes just months after that of of Monsignor William Lynn in Philadelphia.</p> <p>Lynn, who supervised other clergy as an aide to the cardinal, was convicted of felony child endangerment and became the first US church official sent to prison for his handling of abuse complaints. He is appealing his three-to-six-year sentence.</p>",
  "<p>The Premiership is playing host to some experimental law changes this season. Most were trumpeted in advance but one sidestepped pre-publicity: a hooker does not have to throw the ball remotely straight into a lineout and will only get blown if the ball goes directly to his scrum-half.</p> <p>The lineout, on the evidence of the opening two weekends, is going the way of the scrum, a means of restarting play any old how. London Irish's opening try came from a throw to Bryn Evans that was so crooked that it was wide of the second row's outside shoulder.</p> <p>The referee, Greg Garner, did call Gloucester in the second half for a crooked throw to loud ironic cheers, but the application of the laws has become so subjective that the influence of the whistle-blower has become too profound. Garner was hard all afternoon on offences committed by the side taking the ball into a breakdown, contrasting to the approach taken by Luke Pearce at Harlequins the previous night when the defending team tended to be bagged.</p> <p>As Irish did the majority of the attacking, they were on the wrong end of the penalty count, eight to one against them in the second period when the lead kept changing hands and two teams intent on attack served up a platter of open rugby.</p> <p>Gloucester, like London Irish, flopped on the opening day and had not won in Reading for six years. There were times, towards the midway point of both halves, when Irish threatened to pull away only for disciplinary problems to undermine them: Freddie Burns kicked seven penalties for the visitors.</p> <p>His final one tied the scores at 28-28 15 minutes from time. Irish were ahead on tries 3-1 but their defence disintegrated in the closing moments, the replacement scrum-half, Dave, Lewis finding space down the blind-side to send in James Simpson-Daniel as the lead changed hands for the fifth time before Billy Twelvetrees, having just made a try-saving tackle on the wing Marland Yarde, was central in a move that led to Akapusi Qera claiming the final try.</p> <p>In the opening quarter Steve Shingler took the kicks because of a leg injury to Tom Homer that forced the full-back to retire before half-time, landing two penalties to one by Burns. Gloucester's first attack ended when Andy Hazell was penalised for going off his feet at a ruck and it was Irish who created the first try.</p> <p>It was probably the best of the afternoon. Sailosi Tagicakibau had been moved off the wing to fill the creative midfield role his fellow Samoan Seilala Mapusua managed with such accomplishment for five years for Irish and his back-of-the-hand off-load to the looping Shingler saw Homer chip to the line for Topsy Ojo to successfully chase.</p> <p>Gloucester gnawed their way back through Burns's boot. Max Lahiff was such a liability at the breakdown, conceding six points through mindless offences, that the prop was taken off at half-time. His replacement, Halani Aulika, scored his side's second try six minutes after the restart but struggled up front.</p> <p>Gloucester had gone into the interval 16-14 ahead after the England No8 Ben Morgan exploited a lightly guarded fringe defence to barrel through O'Leary, but when the former Ireland scrum-half scored a try from a scrum following another flowing move, Irish were six points ahead with 24 minutes to go.</p> <p>They looked more like claiming five points than none, but they kept annoying Garner and conceded 40 points for the second week in a row. Irish had chances at the end, Tagicakibau losing control of the ball on the line after a tackle by the prop Dan Murphy and Shingler listing a late drop goal.</p> <p><strong>LONDON IRISH</strong> Homer (Watson 34); Ojo, Joseph, Tagicakibau, Yarde; Shingler, O'Leary; Lahiff (Aulika ht), Lawson (Blaney 59), Halavatau (Ryan 57), Skivington (Low 59), Evans, Danaher (capt; Gray 68), Treviranus, Fisher <strong>Tries</strong> Ojo, Aulika, O'Leary <strong>Cons</strong> Shingler 2 <strong>Pens</strong> Shingler 4</p> <p><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong> May; Sharples (Monahan 59), Trinder (Tindall 57), Twelvetrees, Simpson-Daniel; Burns, Robson (Lewis 60); Wood (Murphy 57), Dawidiuk (Edmonds 49), Knight (Harden 47), James (Kalamafoni&#xa0;49), Hamilton (capt), Savage, Hazell (Qera&#xa0;47), Morgan <strong>Tries</strong> Morgan, Simpson-Daniel, Quera <strong>Con </strong>Burns 2 <strong>Pen</strong> Burns 7</p> <p><strong>Madejski Stadium</strong> 5,828</p> <p><strong>Game rating</strong> 8/10 <strong>Referee</strong> Greg Garner</p>",
  "<p>Is Roger Federer finished at the highest level? It might sound an odd question to ask about the world No 1 who, only two months ago at Wimbledon, won his 17th grand slam title by comprehensively beating Andy Murray. Yet at Flushing Meadows this week, the signs were not encouraging, both in the manner of his leaving and his response to defeat. If he wins another US Open title to go with the five he already has it would defy the available evidence.</p> <p>It is not that Federer is not still a great player. It's just that he is not consistently a great player for seven five-set matches in a row, which is the required test to win a major, of which he has more experience than anyone in the history of tennis.</p> <p>When he put together that sequence to win Wimbledon, he proved all the doubters wrong. When he faded a month later against Murray in the Olympics final, John McEnroe was moved to observe, \"That's the first time I've seen him look his age.\"</p> <p>Federer has just turned 31, although he has no significant injury or health problems. He also has a seemingly effortless game that puts less stress on his body than, say, Rafael Nadal's muscular, high-energy tennis, which has again put the Spaniard's future in doubt as he takes an extended break to heal and rest his knees.</p> <p>But the air of invincibility Federer had against every player except Nadal, and latterly Novak Djokovic, has gone. He is not Billy the Kid anymore. A giveaway is when his forehand malfunctions. That extraordinary shot, where Federer seems to float in a world of his own before lathering the ball at a precise angle out of reach of his opponent, is a thing of beauty \u2014 except when it sails into the hoardings. The flower pots have been getting a hiding more often lately.</p> <p>Nothing divides opinion in tennis like a debate about Federer, both his future as a player and the way he either delights or incites the fans and the media. Often, Federer press conferences sound like prayer meetings as fans with laptops, but little objectivity, queue up to pay homage. However, when he states, redundantly, that he has done great things, he feeds the view that he is either insecure (as many champions are) or so lacks self-awareness that he can't hear the sniggering in the background.</p> <p>There is a tweeter called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PseudoFed\" title=\"\">@PseudoFed</a> who preys on his serial self-glorification mercilessly. Federer knows about it, and he is not amused. You would not blame him. Yet he continues to provide his tormentor with ammunition. A classic example was his response to losing to Tomas Berdych in the quarter-finals here. \"I really expected myself to play better tonight,\" Federer said. \"Especially at night, I have had such a great record. I don't know. I felt good, you know. Such an amazing summer I had. I really thought I was going to come out and play a solid match. I didn't do that tonight. Obviously there is a bit of a letdown now.\"</p> <p>The letdown ought to be that Federer struggles to do humble. Where was the respect for Berdych? Where was the acknowledgment that the player on the other side of the net had the right \u2014 and the ability \u2014 to beat him in an important match? His praise for the winner was almost an afterthought.</p> <p>He did the same when Berdych put him out of Wimbledon two years ago, claiming a thigh injury he had picked up in Halle (where Lleyton Hewitt beat him on grass for the first time in 13 attempts) hampered his game. That is a serious breach of player protocol. When told of Federer's excuse, Berdych was livid. They have hardly spoken since.</p> <p>It was left to Paul Annacone, Federer's coach, to lend perspective to the latest defeat. \"I think Berdych played very well and was very offensive, and Roger fought hard but it was one of those times where it didn't all click,\" the American said. \"Sometimes we forget that it actually does happen to the great ones.\"</p> <p>As someone drily remarked, Federer often reminds us how great he is.</p> <p>Certainly, Federer has the physical resilience and, at the moment, the desire to play on for another couple of years, maybe more. My suspicion has always been that he will judge the moment of his departure according to his performance rather than his results because he always thinks he is playing tennis good enough to beat the best. Winning Wimbledon in such devastating fashion enhanced that self-view; folding against Murray might have damaged it and, certainly, losing to Berdych the way he did will have made him think again.</p> <p>Previously, he has said he will play on until the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. That suddenly seems a long way off.</p> <p>This was Berdych's fourth win in the past seven matches they have played but, more significantly, the second in a slam, after that 2010 Wimbledon quarter-final.</p> <p>In the period between his win over Andy Murray to win the Australian Open earlier that year to doing it again at Wimbledon this year, Federer played some beautiful tennis. But it was a barren time for big titles, and that did not please him.</p> <p>For more than two years, he was a king on the outside of his own castle.</p> <p>Getting back to No1 at Wimbledon this year really mattered to a player who has won more majors than anyone else and who, with some justification, is widely regarded as the best of all time.</p> <p>Whether Nadal can come back and overtake Federer's tally of 17 slams is doubtful. Those knees are not getting any better and the opposition is not getting any weaker. So, for the time being, Federer has a kingdom to defend. He will do it for as long as he thinks he can beat the likes of Murray, Djokovic and Nadal in the finals that matter. Once he starts losing to players such as Berdych, with all due respect, he will think again.</p> <p>If he suffers again in Melbourne in January, I think he might look at the calendar and figure on an exit strategy. Where might that be? Christopher Clarey in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/sports/tennis/for-roger-federer-at-us-open-flicker-or-flame-out.html?_r=1&amp;ref=tennis\" title=\"\"><em>New York Times</em></a> has an interesting take on the subject.</p> <p>For the first time in a while, however, Federer let a note of utter dejection enter his post-match audience. When he failed to defend two match points here last year against Djokovic's outrageous hit-and-hope winners in the semi-final, he was angry. This time, he was melancholy.</p> <p>Asked about the possibility of losing his No 1 ranking, he said, \"I've got to go back to the drawing board from here andsee what's really the priority, if that's a priority for the end of the year. I don't know right now. I mean the goal has been achieved, but this is disappointing for me. We'll see where I go from now.\"</p> <p>Like a fighter, he wants to go out a winner. Like a fighter, he might be in for a shock.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's David Smith was given a standing ovation at the boccia gold medal final on Saturday \u2013 and that was before the 23-year-old had even thrown a ball. A sell-out crowd screamed their appreciation for the competitors, some of the most severely disabled athletes competing at these Games, as a tense contest unfolded in a sport best compared to boules or petanque.</p> <p>The final had been billed as a grudge match, a chance to make amends for the 18-1 battering Thailand had inflicted on defending champions Britain in the team BC1-2 semi-final. Both Smith and his opponent, Pattaya Tadtong, had played in that match, but the Briton was determined to put aside any sense of pressure from that defeat, \"baggage\" as he put it.</p> <p>Smith had been tipped with a good chance to come away with the gold but in the event Tadtong, a 2004 bronze medallist, proved just too powerful for him, executing a comprehensive 7-0 defeat (2-0, 1-0, 3-0, 1-0) over four ends. Still the aerospace engineering student refused to be downbeat. \"Hey, I got a silver medal and I played my best at a Paralympics for once,\" he said referencing his 14th place finish in the individual competition in Beijing four years ago. \"I've rectified a few things with this one ... I'm chuffed to bits to be honest. I played a good match and I gave it my best shot I think, I executed really well so I'm happy with that. It's easy to focus on the reward and not the performance.\"</p> <p>Smith sportingly applauded each of Tadtong's impressive shots, blowing his cheeks out at the skill displayed by the opponent. At the finale Tadtong was ecstatic, punching the air before tipping himself out of his wheelchair to roll free and delirious on the court in front of delighted crowds. The atmosphere reached fever pitch as his coach lifted him high up on to his shoulders in a hero's fireman's lift so that the 33-year-old could salute the stands. Afterwards Smith reflected on the qualities of the Thai. \"He played awesome. He's got a lot more power than me and a lot more control and I think that was quite evident on the court, his arm is just fluid. He can get the power and keep it so low down that the ball just hits and goes like crazy.\"</p> <p>The sport has come a long way since Smith began playing \u2013 becoming Britain's youngest ever champion at 14, before winning the world title at 18. As recently as 2005 he was entirely self-funded, shelling out \u00a32,500 just to be able to compete at the European championships and pay for carers and coaches to accompany him. Boccia, a sport much praised by Boris Johnson, the London mayor, who said he fell in love with it after watching the game in Beijing, seems to have won over British crowds but Smith hopes that there will be more media attention on championships in between Paralympic cycles and improved take-up at grassroots level. \"It's a great game for a lot of disabled people who wouldn't have the chance to compete in sport otherwise. Boccia gives them that&#xa0;opportunity.\"</p> <p>Asked to comment on the impending cuts to the Disability Living Allowance, Smith turned down the opportunity to score any political points. \"I just hope they do it in a fair way,\" he said. \"It's very important that [disabled people] are the best we can be so we have an opportunity to participate in society. By giving us the opportunity to be the best we can then contribute. We don't want everything easy, we just want an equal footing so we can get on with our lives and help society.\"</p> <p>Smith is already well on his way to achieving that goal. After being presented with a modified VW caddy car in July \u2013 by the Queen, no less \u2013 with hand controls that enable him to drive independently, he is interested in pursuing a career in improving disability adaptions to cars.</p> <p>The Eastleigh-based Briton, whose nickname is \"Chicken Wings\", now faces an even tougher challenge \u2013 convincing his girlfriend Kathryn to marry him. \"She said I had to win two medals and at least one of them had to be gold but hopefully she'll moderate her standards a little bit,\" he joked. Kathryn was unable to be in the arena to watch her boyfriend. She suffers from brittle bones and was recovering from an operation on her neck. \"She was gutted not to be here,\" said Smith, \"but she's happy, she's been keeping up to date with the scores and she's chuffed to bits.\"</p>",
  "<p>If any city can take the arrival of a trainload of musicians from Africa and Britain in its stride, it's Bristol. After all, half a mile up the road from the Creative Commons big top where they are playing, gangs of actors dressed as zombies are roaming the city centre in the mass participation street game, 2.8 Hours Later, part of the annual IgFest. Compared with the undead, Africa Express seems pretty normal.</p> <p>And this is also the city that, 30 years ago, became the home base for the Womad organisation, after a group of idealistic punks persuaded Peter Gabriel that bringing musicians from across the world to a west country festival was a good idea. The spirit of cross-cultural pollination that Womad was always keen to foster has been taken on by Damon Albarn and his travelling troupe, with all the modern updates of Twitter feeds, rolling blogs and photos uploaded by the musicians as they travel between cities, rehearsing, jamming and clearly having a ball. They spread out in groups across the city during the day after pulling in to the Brunel-designed Temple Meads station. Malian singer Afel Bocum and John Paul Jones played a pop-up set in the Canteen, one of the many independent bars and clubs rejuvenating the Stokes Croft area.</p> <p>Back in the big top, the evening audience contained a mix of the curious and the converted, with many veterans of Womad events who were entirely familiar with the various African instruments \u2013 koras and balofons, tama drums and ouds \u2013 on show. With up to 20 musicians crammed on to the stage at any one time, there was a sense of barely contained anarchy \u2013 with one very muscular stage manager changing mic stands, making sure the right guitars were on stage at the right time for the right musicians, and generally keeping a lid on the simmering chaos.</p> <p>In a rolling four-hour programme, themes and stars emerged. It was striking to realise just how much hip-hop has moulded the sound of the younger African artists \u2013 and how they in turn are changing it. Also notable was the absence of the long, noodly guitar solos that can dominate in an improvised show (and many of these songs are worked up and rehearsed on the train). Instead, everyone plays in complete service to the rhythm, with lots of urgent eye contact between players.</p> <p>For this kind of thing to work the musicians have to be better than good \u2013 as everyone here was. The British jazz drummer Seb Roachford shone, as did the elegant Malian singer Rokia Traor\u00e9. Her duet with Albarn on the Gorillaz song Melancholy Hill was a gentle and heartstopping quiet in the storm. Amadou Bagayoko, here without his singing partner Mariam, showed what a creative guitarist he is, lifting a version of the Clash's Train in Vain (well, there had to be one train song, surely?)</p> <p>Albarn may be the public face of Africa Express, but he was determined to remain mainly in the background, playing keyboards and rarely coming to stage front. He sang lead on one song, apologising before its start because it was, he said, a rehearsal for the following night's London show, where it would be played with a special guest on vocals. His attempt at mimicking Paul McCartney's high vocal line on the 1970s Wings single Coming Up \u2013 was well worth the apology, but greeted with good humour. Expect it to be a lot better when the original singer joins up and the song's African roots \u2013 its snaking guitar line owes much to McCartney's stay in Lagos while recording <em>Band on the Run</em> \u2013 are fully explored.</p> <p>The second biggest roar of the evening greeted the leviathan bass line of Led Zeppelin's Kashmir, remade here with British and African rappers rushing over and under the beat, Traor\u00e9 adding a ghostly vocal and John Paul Jones, the man who wrote its epic, North African-influenced string arrangements, playing mandolin in a maelstrom of noise.</p> <p>Here was a moment that summed up the night: a horn section valiantly trying but failing to lead the huge band into a key change, a host of young rappers yelling wildly at an avuncular bloke in a suit with a mandolin \u2013 and a beaming, no longer harassed stage manager enthusiastically joining the percussion section.</p> <p>In all the hothouse of new, unfamiliar, exhilarating material, it was forgivable that the evening's biggest cheer was reserved for the end of this well loved warhorse of a song, written long before many of those performing it had been born.</p>",
  "<p>She has the eyes of her father, a gaze that became an emblem for the 20th century. She also has his deep sense of social injustice, but Dr Aleida Guevara has always had to share her \"papi\" with the world.</p> <p>While she doesn't mind the posters, the flags, the postcards, graffiti paintings and T-shirts, Dr Guevara and her family are trying to clamp down on \"disrespectful\" uses of her father's famous photo, taken by Alberto Korda in 1960.

This year is also the 50th anniversary of the US \"blockade\", the ongoing commercial, trade and travel embargo which has stifled Cuba's economy. The cold war era-style standoff still sees America spend millions beaming propaganda radio and TV stations into Cuba. Cubans remain the only immigrants the US encourages in with automatic citizenship.</p> <p>An underdeveloped country offering world-class education and healthcare for all, Cuba maintains anti-dissident policies, imprisoning journalists and anti-government activists. Despite a mass prison release of dissidents in 2011, Cuban authorities, says Amnesty International, \"do not tolerate any criticism of state policies outside the official mechanisms established under government control. Laws on 'public disorder', 'dangerousness' and 'aggression' are used to prosecute government opponents. No political or human rights organisations are allowed to obtain legal status.\"</p> <p>Dr Guevara is in the UK for another anniversary, the 14th year since the Miami Five \u2013 spies entrusted with infiltrating anti-Castro terrorist groups operating from Florida \u2013 were jailed by the US. The 51-year-old Havana paedriatician will lead an evening vigil in London outside the US embassy on 18 September. \"I'm not political,\" she insists, \"but I care about injustice.\"</p> <p>Aleida was seven when Che was killed in a remote Bolivian hamlet by a group of Bolivian soldiers and CIA operatives. With only shadowy memories of her father, she has got to know him through his diaries and the reminiscences of others, including the man she calls \"Uncle\" \u2013 Fidel Castro.</p> <p>\"Fidel has told me many beautiful stories about my father, but I cannot ask him too much, he still gets very emotional at the thought of Che. For example, my father had terrible handwriting, so my mother was asked to transcribe his diaries. When Ra\u00fal Castro came to our house to collect the manuscript, my mother knew that Ra\u00fal and Fidel also kept diaries, so she said 'if there are accounts in the diaries that differ then you must go with Che's, because he is not here to defend himself'. Ra\u00fal got very angry and said 'No, while Fidel and I are alive, Che is alive. He is always with us.' They were crying then.</p> <p>\"If Che hadn't died in Bolivia, he would have died in Argentina trying to change things there,\" she says. \"Maybe it would be a different continent today. My mother always says that if my father had lived we would all have been better human beings.\"</p> <p>Che was a medical student in Argentina when, on a motorcycle tour around Latin America in 1952, he became incensed by the poverty he saw. He took up political theorising and then arms, joining the revolution that overthrew Cuba's vicious Batista regime.</p> <p>It was then, as the middle class and wealthy fled Cuba for Miami, that a bitter chasm opened between the two nations, and it has deepened from president to president. The promise of President Obama to tackle the Cuban issue has come to nothing so far. \"We had great hopes, but we are disappointed in Obama, maybe things have even got worse for us,\" Dr Guevara says.</p> <p>Revolution, she believes, simmers on in Latin America, where the gulf between rich and poor is escalating and she blames, as Che did, creeping American-led industrialisation. \"This economic crisis is even more dangerous than any before for Latin America. It's not only about oil now, the US want water too. Brazil is destroying its rainforest to mine out iron, Mexico is a dumping ground for unwanted waste. This time the land is being destroyed as well.\"</p> <p>Critics of Che claim the photogenic young man in battle fatigues who wrote poetry overshadows the brutality of his revolution. Guevara showed no qualms about killing. \"It was a revolution,\" says his daughter. \"Of course, I would rather there was no bloodshed but that is the nature of revolution. In a true revolution you have to get what you want by force. An enemy who doesn't want to give you what you want? Maybe you have to take it. My father knew the risk he took with his own life.</p> <p>\"I was angry, of course, growing up without a dad, but my mother always says, love your father for who he was, a man who had to do what he did. My father died defending his ideals. Up to the last minute he was true to what he believed in. This is what I admire.\"</p> <p>But she says she would like to have been able to argue with him. \"When I was six he sent me a letter. In it he said I should be good and help my mother with household chores. I was angry because my brother's letter said 'I will take you to the moon' and my other brother's read 'We will go and fight imperialism together'. I was annoyed \u2013 I wanted to go to the moon, why couldn't I fight imperialism?\"</p> <p>Dr Guevara is the eldest of Che's four children with his second wife, Aleida. \"We didn't have privileges growing up as Che's children. My colleagues didn't know who I was until I first talked on Cuban TV in 1996. But it's important not to keep silent, because there is injustice being wrought.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 September to correct the date of the evening vigil at the US Embassy.</p>",
  "<p>This was a worryingly familiar tale for Craig Levein. Scotland opened their failed Euro 2012 qualifying campaign with a scoreless draw in Lithuania, a result that appeared increasingly damaging as the section moved on. In eight matches of that group, the Scots notched a mere nine goals.</p> <p>Bluntness was again the key Scottish failing as they began their bid to make it to the World Cup in 2014. Levein's popularity suffered another blow on account of Scotland's glaring lack of punch against Serbia. The manager has never been fully embraced by a section of fans; the boos that echoed around Hampden Park at full time illustrated the growing levels of discontent.</p> <p>Serbia should not be dismissed as international no-marks but this was uninspiring stuff for Scottish supporters. The other teams looking to progress from Group A \u2013 namely Croatia, Wales and Belgium \u2013 had cause for more positive emotion as two of their rivals immediately dropped points.</p> <p>Levein is, in fact, in danger of being undone by his own words. The manager has been gushing in his praise of Scotland's players and their collective talent. On Friday, Levein even claimed his team was capable of winning all of their World Cup qualification matches.</p> <p>Evidence, and blunt reality, suggests otherwise, as was proven within 24 hours of that statement. Failure to beat Serbia at home represents a clear setback with pressure now intense, not least on Levein himself, ahead of Macedonia's visit to Glasgow on Tuesday evening. If Scotland stumble again in that encounter, their hopes of turning out in Brazil will look fanciful; Macedonia's showing in their 1-0 defeat away to Croatia on Friday night was sufficient to show their potential menace.</p> <p>\"I am disappointed but more about the fact we had opportunities and didn't take them,\" Levein said after this scoreless draw. \"We did enough to win the game. We just couldn't score goals. I am disappointed but not down about it. I thought the lads put on a decent show.</p> <p>\"I know we can play better. We did a lot of good things, but if two or three of our normally more creative players had just found that final pass, we would have been walking away with a win. We got into the areas we needed to get into, but we didn't quite manage to force the ball&#xa0;home.\"</p> <p>Scotland's finest performers were in defensive positions; Allan McGregor in goal, Andy Webster and the debutant Paul Dixon. That in itself represents manna from heaven for those among Levein's detractors who continually highlight the manager's failure to reintroduce Sunderland's striker Steven Fletcher into the international scene. Kenny Miller, the lone Scotland forward here, toiled badly.</p> <p>A tight, edgy and nervous first half featured just a single clear-cut chance. The hosts' Robert Snodgrass had it, but watched Vladimir Stojkovic save with his chest. At the opposite end, McGregor smartly halted a Darko Lazovic shot.</p> <p>Television pictures highlighted Steven Naismith catching Srdan Mijailovic with a stray elbow. There remains the outside possibility of retrospective punishment for the Scotland player, given that the referee, Jonas Eriksson of Sweden, missed the incident completely.</p> <p>After 20 minutes of the second period the Scotland support sang the name of Jordan Rhodes, the \u00a38m forward initially left among Levein's substitutes. By that point, Miller had failed to convert two James Morrison passes and headed a third opportunity away from the Serbia&#xa0;goal.</p> <p>The finest chance of the game was still to come. Gary Caldwell, winning his 50th cap, sent Naismith clean through on goal but the Everton man rather summed up his dismal afternoon by shooting wide.</p> <p>Levein reverted to a 4-4-2 set-up with the introduction of Rhodes and Jamie Mackie. Another Scotland substitute, James Forrest, came close to snatching victory in the dying seconds but Serbia were also denied as McGregor halted Dusan Tadic.</p> <p>\"We got out of this game with a draw. It's not what we wanted, but it's certainly not a disaster,\" Levein said. \"We were hoping to win the match, but these things happen and overall we played very well, there's been a definite progression.\" That \"p\" word is yet to be endorsed by&#xa0;results.</p>",
  "<p>An Iranian Christian pastor who refused to renounce his faith after being sentenced to death for apostasy has been released from prison.</p> <p>Youcef Nadarkhani, 35, was released from prison on Saturday and reunited with his family after a court in the northern city of Rasht, the capital of Iran's Gilan province, acquitted him of apostasy, which carried the death sentence under Iran's Sharia law.</p> <p>\"Nadarkhani was acquitted of apostasy but instead charged with acting against the national security and therefore sentenced to three years in jail,\" a reliable source in Rasht, who asked not to be named for fear of government reprisal, told the Guardian. \"But because he had already served three years in prison, he was allowed to go home.\"</p> <p>It is believed Nadarkhani's lawyer argued in court that Iran was a signatory to international treaties requiring it to respect freedom of religion.</p> <p>Nadarkhani was arrested in October 2009 for converting at the age of 19 to Christianity from Islam, his parent's religion. Although he insisted he was never a practising Muslim, Iran considers the religion of a child to be that of his father. Those who convert to other religions risk arrest or even execution for apostasy.</p> <p>In 2010, Nadarkhani was sentenced to death after being found guilty of apostasy, a conviction upheld by a supreme court in 2011. Iran's penal code does not have a definitive ruling for apostasy and the judge often refers to the Sharia law for such cases.</p> <p>According to Amnesty International, Nadarkhani was arrested because he \"protested against his child being given mandatory lessons on Islam in school\".</p> <p>Nadarkhani was reportedly told during his previous court hearings that he could be freed if he renounced Christianity, which he repeatedly refused. \"I am resolute in my faith and Christianity and have no wish to recant,\" he told a judge, according to Amnesty.</p> <p>Nadarkhani's case attracted international condemnation. Amnesty described him as a prisoner of conscience who was \"being held solely on the basis of his religious beliefs\".</p> <p>In April, another pastor, Farshid Fathi, 33, became the latest victim of state persecution of Christian converts after being sentenced to six years in prison by a revolutionary court, Iran Christian News Agency reported.</p> <p>Other religious minorities in Iran have been facing restrictions, including Bah\u00e1'\u00eds. Seven leaders of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community are serving 20-year jail sentences. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in Iran are deprived of rights, such as education or owning businesses, and are often persecuted for their beliefs.</p>",
  "<p>The Northern Cheyenne people have a saying: \"A nation is not defeated until the hearts of its women are on the ground. Then it's finished. No matter how brave its warriors, or how strong its weapons.\" Well, we are pretty sure that for much of the Native American community, the nation is near defeat.</p> <p>What else can we say when <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/us/native-americans-struggle-with-high-rate-of-rape.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">one out of every three Native American women</a> report they have been raped, or that an attempt has been made to sexually brutalise them? That is more than <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/maze-of-injustice\" title=\"\">2.5 times</a> the national average. And if you think those numbers are staggering, consider who is carrying out these attacks: at least <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/maze-of-injustice\" title=\"\">86%</a> of sexual assaults are reportedly being perpetrated by non-Native men, according to the US department of justice.</p> <p>We don't think about such massive sexual assault rates happening in industrialised places like the US. We think about them as war crimes happening in downtrodden, developing countries. But here we have rates of sexualised violence that rival anything the Women's Media Center project <a href=\"http://www.womenundersiegeproject.org/\" title=\"\">Women Under Siege</a> has documented in <a href=\"http://www.womenundersiegeproject.org/conflicts/profile/darfur-sudan\" title=\"\">Sudan</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.womenundersiegeproject.org/conflicts/profile/democratic-republic-of-congo#numbers\" title=\"\">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>, where, according to a<a href=\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2010.300070\" title=\"\"> study</a> published in the American Journal of Public Health, 12% of women say they've been raped in their lifetime.</p> <p>A culture of remarkably high impunity is also thriving. The justice department reports that it makes arrests in merely 13% of the sexual assaults reported by Native women. That comparees with 32% for white women, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/us/native-americans-struggle-with-high-rate-of-rape.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">according</a> to the New York Times. Native women are also not reporting crimes, because they trust that nothing will be done in the terrible knot that is the tribal lands' jurisdictional confusion (between tribal courts and the federal government), and a combination of racism, a lack of victim services, and not enough police. Whatever's going on, justice is not taking root.</p> <p>\"When you make that first phone call and there is one officer for the entire tribal community and he can't respond or take evidence, and then a woman experiences racism at the hospital,\" said Cristina Finch, the policy and advocacy director of women's human rights at Amnesty International USA,<br>that's when a woman gives up, goes home, and tries to live the rest of her life battered and broken, struggling to survive after rape. According to Finch, racism is \"a very large factor\" in what is happening to Native American women.</p> <p>In 2007, Amnesty published a groundbreaking report on the rape of Native women called <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/maze-of-injustice\" title=\"\">\"Maze of Injustice\"</a> . It describes the complexities that keep women suffering violence in a loop of pain. But the ache goes back much further than the last few years. \"We pass on the pain through our soul and spirit,\" said Sarah Deer, a Native American law scholar and activist.</p> <p>Colonisation brought about the original injury, but a wound has continued to be worried each time another person enacts violence against the community. Without recourse, it's hard to feel like colonisation has ever come to an end. Beyond that, rape and abuse have always stemmed from outsiders. It is well documented through oral tradition that prior to the European invasion, sexual and domestic violence was not accepted and virtually did not exist in indigenous society.</p> <p>There are pieces of legislation that would alleviate some of this pain. There's the <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4154\" title=\"\">SAVE Native Women Act</a>, which, if it makes it through Congress, would take steps to restore authority to tribes to prosecute cases of domestic violence, including against non-Native perpetrators. The <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/usa-amnesty-international-commends-president-obama-for-signing-tribal-law-and-order-act\" title=\"\">Tribal Law and Order Act</a> increases the ability for tribal courts to impose sentences for crimes committed on tribal lands to up to three years, up from one. And the Senate version of the <a href=\"http://www.womenundersiegeproject.org/blog/entry/why-is-stopping-gender-violence-a-womens-issue\" title=\"\">reauthorisation of the Violence Against Women Act</a> includes provisions that would finally allow tribal courts to prosecute non-Native people in domestic violence cases \u2013 although the House decided to write their own bill that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/16/house-passes-violence-against-women-act_n_1522524.html\" title=\"\">excluded these provisions</a>.</p> <p>These are mostly encouraging steps, but we have to speed up our pace before more women are sexually violated. For too many Native women, rape is not a question of \"if\", it's simply a matter of \"when\".</p>",
  "<p>My new book, Vagina: A New Biography, has just come out in the UK \u2013 to a whirlwind of reaction. Why write about the vagina? And why now?</p> <p>The main answer is that new neuroscience, which has been very little reported outside of scientific journals, is providing truly revolutionary new information about what the vagina is and does \u2013 information that, in my mind, makes our entire way of seeing that organ, which is regarded generally, in this culture, as merely a sex organ \u2013 obsolete. New information in related fields is also transforming, or should transform, our understanding of sex itself for women.</p> <p>The main headline, in my view? The new science has established a radically new insight: that there is such a strong brain-vagina connection in women that many of the neuroscientists whom I interviewed called it \"a single system\". More remarkably, few of us know that when a woman has an orgasm \u2013 and, even before that, when she feels empowered to think about pleasurable sex, anticipate it, focus on how to get it, and feels in control of and knowledgeable enough about her body to know she can probably reach orgasm during sex \u2013 <a href=\"http://bodyodd.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/30/13554806-womans-non-stop-orgasms-too-much-of-a-good-thing?lite\">her brain gets a boost of the neurotransmitter dopamine</a>. Then, in orgasm, opioids and <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2011/11/16/the-science-of-sex/\">oxytocin</a> are also released. This experience does not just yield pleasure, a fact that is well known; it also yields specific states of mind.</p> <p>Dopamine is what I call the ultimate feminist neurotransmitter: it yields motivation and goal-orientedness, trust in one's own judgement and, most notably of all, in my mind, confidence. (Cocaine, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/why-we-all-have-internet-addiction-genes/262112/\">powerfully stimulates release of dopamine</a> \u2013 hence the crazy confidence and sociability of coke users, at least under the influence, responding to that boost). <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22176-drug-allows-morphine-to-relieve-pain-without-addiction.html\">Opioids</a> give the brain the sensation of ecstasy or transcendence; and finally, oxytocin \u2013 which can be released both when a woman's nipples are being stimulated and during the contractions of orgasm \u2013 creates <a href=\"http://scientopia.org/blogs/scicurious/2009/11/11/oxytocin-this-ones-for-the-ladies/\">a sense</a> of bonding, caring and intimacy. Oxytocin has been shown in studies to give people with heightened levels an advantage in reading the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19632787\">emotions of faces</a>.</p> <p>So, given this chemical bath, it is fair to say that the vagina is not just a sex organ at all, but a powerful mediator of female confidence, creativity and the sense of the connections between things. </p> <p>Realizing the nature of this brain-vagina connection led me, as a feminist, to have the next obvious insight. If female anticipation of pleasurable sex, and female orgasm, led to this kind of mood-alteration \u2013 among many other newly-documented outcomes I report on in the book \u2013 this also explains why female sexuality, and the vagina in particular, have been controlled, abused, targeted, derided and shamed. And why women have been mystified and kept in ignorance of their own sexual responses \u2013 for five millennia, certainly in the west. The dopamine loop also, of course, explains why some cultures practice cliterodectomy and infibulations \u2013 practices that we should now understand alter not simply the body and sexual functioning, but the influences on the female brain itself. </p> <p>In the book, I survey the cultural history of the vagina also. When you put the history together side by side with these astonishing new discoveries about the neuroscience of female desire, you comprehend, as one reader put it, \"the whole story of why the vagina must be targeted and shamed in one big lie.\"</p> <p>The, to me, mindblowing insights from this cutting-edge science do not end there: I learned that a strong body of data now show that the harm or injury of \"nonviolent\" rape goes far beyond what we (or the courts) have realized. Rape or sexual abuse that women may have experienced can change minute aspects of their bodies' and minds' very functions. It can alter, for example, the operation of their baseline autonomic nervous systems, so that raped women in one study (by Rellini and Meston) have different physiological responses to erotic videos and even to physical exercise than a control group of women who have not been so traumatised. Further; a researcher named Dr Burke Richmond has found a constellation of seemingly unrelated medical symptoms \u2013 from \"phobic postural sway\", which allows a woman literally to be more easily pushed over, to tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and perceptual problems such as vertigo \u2013 which last for years after a \"nonviolent\" rape.</p> <p>These and other outcomes should radically alter the way the crime of rape is perceived and prosecuted. The new science establishes that in terms of harm, there is no such thing as a nonviolent rape. This should change the way rape is treated: the talking cure, for instance, often is not enough.</p> <p>The new science offers some remarkable positive insights. These are especially in a situation such as ours in which, 40 years after \"the sexual revolution\", studies show that 30-40% of western women self-report \"hypoactive sexual desire\". In other words, they are just not that into it, probably because they are not having reliably good enough experiences with it. About 30% also report being unable to reach orgasm regularly during lovemaking. The good news from the new science is that we have misunderstood women's anatomy and pleasure; with better knowledge, we might address the issue of women's unsatisfactory sexual experience.</p> <p>Scientists, for instance, have found a \"neural arm\" \u2013 horrible language, but our vocabulary is very impoverished \u2013 in the female pelvis, which they had not known existed. This has led to a reassessment of the previous assumption that the clitoris and \"g-spot\" were separate entities: instead, they form the north and south of the same neural structure. (This explains why over 90% of women reached orgasm \u2013 in lab conditions, with strangers \u2013 when both parts of their bodies were stimulated at the same time.) <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/01/72325\">Drs Barry Komisaruk and Beverly Whipple</a> have recently found that when you stimulate different parts of a woman's vagina, cervix or clitoris, she experiences different emotions and the touch activates different brain functions. Komisaruk has also identified a new center of sexual sensation in women, at the mouth of the cervix.</p> <p>These scientists have also found that female \"pelvic innervation\" (that is, neural wiring) is very different from male pelvic innervation: women have eight or or so tangles of \"neural termini\" all over their pelvises \u2013 from vaginal walls to clitoris to perineum and anus and so on, and every woman is different. The male system is simpler and more regular. So female and male sexual response, in spite of what <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/23/reviews/bright-response.html\">Masters and Johnson</a> believed, is not identical \u2013 and a lover of women does well to identify that specific woman's responses, unique to her, rather than assuming he or she \"knows what works\" from general past experience.</p> <p>Also amazing, to me, is the discovery of Dr Jim Pfaus of Concordia University in Canada of the role played by female sexual pleasure and desire in mate selection (from experiments in lower mammals). It was liberating to me to witness in his lab how obvious it was that evolution, or Nature (call it what you will), had so valued female desire. It put the issue beyond the contested realm of culture and value judgments. As he put it, his lab rats had never heard themselves be called \"sluts\".</p> <p>Most powerful to me of all of this transformative information is the fact that I now know how powerfully the vagina affects female consciousness, confidence, risk-taking and autonomy. These insights answer so many questions. Rather that asking \"why the vagina? Why now?\", I am now more inclined to ask: why the repressive patriarchal silence about such important information? And why tolerate it any longer?</p>",
  "<p>\"I thought that if you had an acoustic guitar/Then it meant that you were a protest singer\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPqe4picy7A\" title=\"\">sang the Smiths</a> in 1985. Lots of people seem to have thought that about <a href=\"http://frank-turner.com/\" title=\"\">Frank Turner</a> until they read Michael Hann's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/sep/04/frank-turner-right-wing\" title=\"\">blogpost</a> highlighting anti-leftist comments that Turner had made in a 2009 interview.</p> <p>The singer-songwriter responded with a <a href=\"http://frank-turner.com/blog/2012/09/schmolitics/\" title=\"\">blogpost</a> of his own, seeking to set the record straight: \"Most of my friends disagree with me, not least Billy Bragg and Chris T-T. But, being adults, we understand that intelligent people can disagree about stuff. Despite occasionally running my mouth \u2026 I don't think people who call themselves socialists are evil, mad, stupid or deserving of being attacked; I just see the world differently.\"</p> <p>The last time I discussed politics with Turner, we were sharing a tiny dressing room at a benefit gig for people with disabilities. I was chiding him for claiming in an interview that he was not a political songwriter. I reminded him what happened at his recent Wembley Arena gig when he played his song Glory Hallelujah \u2013 12,000 people lifted up their voices and sang the refrain \"Because there never was no God\".</p> <p>\"C'mon,\" I said, \"You've got to admit that's political.\" He shook his head vehemently. \"No, it's not,\" he said, taking a slug on another of my beers. \"It's just me saying what I think\". Was he being evasive, unwilling to engage in political debate for fear of revealing his rightwing leanings? Or simply refusing to have his politics defined by the values of a previous generation?</p> <p>Although we come from differing backgrounds, Turner and I began our political journeys from the same point, self-identifying as anarchists. My anarchy was inspired not by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin\" title=\"\">Bakunin</a>, but by the Sex Pistols. It was less a political philosophy, more a late-70s version of postwar youth, first articulated by Marlon Brando in the 1953 biker movie The Wild One. When someone asks him what he's rebelling against, Brando laconically replies \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkdqCTcDkbc\" title=\"\">What have you got?</a>\".</p> <p>While it never amounted to much more than a rhetorical position in drink-fuelled discussions, thinking of myself as an anarchist absolved me from voting in the 1979 UK general election, my argument being that there was no real discernible difference between Labour and the Tories.</p> <p>Events quickly exposed my naivety. By the 1983 election, I recognised that the Tories under Margaret Thatcher were different to Labour, threatening the things that I took for granted such as the welfare state, peace in Europe, our diverse society. Yet my debut album, released that year, expressed politics that were mostly personal. It took the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/miners-strike-1984-85\" title=\"\">miners' strike</a> to open my eyes. After a year of playing benefit gigs in mining communities up and down the country, witnessing class war at first hand, I began writing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjUA3RU4B8E\" title=\"\">songs</a> that spoke in the ideological language of the left. In interviews, I identified myself as a socialist.</p> <p>Turner, like most musicians of his generation, has never played on a picket line. Born in 1981, he spent 2000-2005 in a hardcore punk band called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dead\" title=\"\">Million Dead</a>. This period also saw the rise in popularity of the MP3 music file. For the first time, peer-to-peer file sharing offered musicians a means to reach their audience without surrendering control to the man.</p> <p>When the major record companies moved to close down the Napster file sharing site in 2001, many saw this as an attempt to suppress the freedoms that they enjoyed on the internet. Anger was directed not only against corporate conglomerates and government agencies implementing the crack-down, but at the whole concept of copyright itself. Bloggers began to self-identify as libertarians, giving a political dimension to their anger.</p> <p>I get the feeling that Turner's politics were defined by this struggle, that, inspired by the libertarian language of the blogosphere, he adopted a worldview that echoes that espoused by Mick Jagger in the 1960s.</p> <p>Following his release from drugs charges in 1967, Jagger <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB_XLVAleP4\" title=\"\">was interviewed on TV</a> by William Rees-Mogg, then editor of the Times. According to his memoirs, Rees-Mogg, expecting to hear Jagger express the left-leaning views of the Beatles, was astonished to find that the leader of the Rolling Stones took an individualistic libertarian view on ethical and social issues. Writing years later, Rees-Mogg argued that Jagger <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/mick-jagger-says-to-former-editor-of-the-times-you-saved-my-career\" title=\"\">could be described as an early Thatcherite</a>.</p> <p>Which is not to say that Turner is a follower of the Iron Lady. Rather, he seems to have come to the same conclusion that I did in the late 70s, that there is not much difference between Labour and the Tories. I think he's wrong, but, having come of age in a time when ideology was dumped in favour of triangulation, who can blame him?</p> <p>His angry denunciation of the left, made in the 2009 <a href=\"http://moonandbackmusic.com/archives/1323\" title=\"\">Moon &amp; Back Music</a> interview, should be seen in that light. He made these comments before the Tories came to power, galvanising a new generation into anti-cuts activists, and he has quickly issued a statement making it clear that he is no supporter of David Cameron. And of course he isn't the first pop star to slip spectacularly on a banana skin when making sweeping statements about politics.</p> <p>Turner has a social conscience, let no one be in any doubt about that. He will stand in opposition to anyone he feels is holding people back from reaching their full potential \u2013 witness his support for the rights of people with disabilities at that benefit gig last month. What he doesn't have \u2013 or even feels he requires \u2013 is an ideological analysis to back up the ideas expressed in his songs.</p> <p>Since Labour dropped <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1994/oct/05/labour.uk\" title=\"\">Clause Four</a>, mainstream politics in Britain has, for better or worse, become increasingly post-ideological. Given that sea change, is it right to expect the new generation, angry at the unfairness of Cameron's Britain, to express themselves in the same political language that we used in the 20th century? Turner and many of his generation, see the world differently. That doesn't mean we can't work together to find new ways to articulate the ideals that we share.</p>",
  "<p>The laws on assisted dying are \"ridiculous\" and \"appalling\", according to a newly promoted health minister.</p> <p>Anna Soubry, who was appointed parliamentary under secretary at the Department of Health in this week's reshuffle, called for greater \"honesty\" about when prosecutions would be brought for helping relatives to die and said the legislation needed to evolve.</p> <p>Her Liberal Democrat colleague Norman Lamb, who was moved to the health department at the same time, said he believed there was \"a strong case\" for the present law to be reconsidered.</p> <p>Soubry also criticised private health care and praised the \"fantastic\" National Health Service.</p> <p>Her comments on euthanasia come after Tony Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome, died a week after he lost a court case to end his life with a doctor's help.</p> <p>Soubry said: \"You can't say to a doctor or a nurse you can kill this person,\" she told The Times. But she said that it was \"appalling\" that the terminally ill who needed help to end their lives had to go abroad. \"I think it's ridiculous and appalling that people have to go abroad to end their life instead of being able to end their life at home,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The rules that we have about who we don't prosecute allow things to happen but there's a good argument that we should be a bit more honest about it.\"</p> <p>Assisting someone to die can carry a sentence of up to 14 years' imprisonment.</p> <p>Soubry also praised the NHS, describing two bad experiences in private hospitals.</p> <p>\"The first time they flushed out my sinuses and I have a hole as a result because it went wrong. The second time I had my ovary removed \u2013 it was horrible. I felt unloved and unwanted. So when I had my gall bladder out, and a polyp on my throat, I had that done on the NHS, it was fantastic. I had both my daughters on the NHS \u2013 for me, The NHS is better,\" she said.</p> <h2>Tony Nicklinson</h2> <p>The highly contentious issue is in the spotlight again after Nicklinson's death. His widow said on Saturday she would continue his fight to for the legal right to die.</p> <p>Jane Nicklinson said she would appeal against a high court decision made over her late husband because \"nobody should have to suffer like Tony did\".</p> <p>The 58-year-old father of two had been refusing food and contracted pneumonia after he was left \"crestfallen\" by the court's decision. He died at his home surrounded by family on August 22.</p> <p>Jane Nicklinson, 56, has decided to lodge an appeal herself as his widow and carer. The British Humanist Association has also applied to intervene in the case.</p> <p>The announcement comes on the day Nicklinson was required to lodge his application for permission to appeal against the court's judgment.</p> <p>His widow, from Melksham, Wiltshire, said: \"I am delighted that I am able to continue what Tony started. I feel very strongly that this issue should be addressed.</p> <p>\"It is too late for Tony but I hope that we can now help those who find themselves in a similar position. Nobody should have to suffer like he did.\"</p> <p>Her husband was a keen sportsman until he was paralysed by a stroke while on a business trip to Athens in 2005.</p> <p>Three judges sitting at the high court in London referred to his \"terrible predicament\", which they described as \"deeply moving and tragic\".</p> <p>But Lord Justice Toulson, Mr Justice Royce and Mrs Justice Macur unanimously agreed it would be wrong for the court to depart from the long-established legal position that \"voluntary euthanasia is murder, however understandable the motives may be\".</p> <p>They said doctors and solicitors who encouraged or assisted another person to kill themselves were \"at real risk of prosecution\". A funeral was held for Nicklinson last week. His family's lawyers said the private service was held in his home county of Wiltshire, but did not provide any further details.</p>",

This is the first time that we have launched a mass quit attempt like Stoptober and would encourage people who want to quit to get involved.\"</p> <p>Jean King, Cancer Research UK's director of tobacco control, said: \"Smoking accounts for one in four cancer deaths and nearly a fifth of all cancer cases so it's vital that work continues to support smokers to quit. Breaking the addiction is difficult so new and innovative campaigns such as this are hugely important.\"</p> <p>Maureen Talbot, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"Stopping smoking is the single best thing you can do for your own health, as well as those you love and live with. About two thirds of smokers say they want to quit, so Stoptober provides a great opportunity to join thousands of people in the same situation and ditch the cigarettes for good.\"</p> <p>The health minister Norman Lamb, who stopped smoking last week, said the cost of the campaign was about \u00a32m.</p> <p>He told BBC Breakfast: \"It costs the NHS over \u00a32.7bn a year, over 1,200 people are admitted to hospital every day as a result of smoking, so this is an enormous killer. With the number of lives that are lost, and the number of families that are destroyed as a result of that, surely to commit a bit of resource to a campaign that could result in saving lives is worthwhile.\"</p>",
  "<p>The woman behind the hugely successful new BBC drama <em>Parade's End</em> is leading a campaign to give female directors a better deal in television.</p> <p>Susanna White, whose adaptation of Ford Madox Ford's four-volume novel is winning widespread acclaim, is a member of Directors UK, a group representing British film and television directors, which has set up an all-women working party to examine the difficulties experienced by aspiring female directors. The move is partly a response to the fact that no women were entered for the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes film festival.</p> <p>White told the <em>Observer</em> that she had only broken into the top ranks of directors with extreme difficulty. \"I think my journey has been a very, very, slow one.\"</p> <p>Welcoming the new focus, she said: \"I'm very keen for this to happen. We really thought it needed addressing.\"</p> <p>White said gender stereotypes still plague the industry, with directors assumed to be domineering types. \"It is partly about people's images of leadership. With directors, it's about a powerful person in charge, a George Clooney figure, [but] you don't have to be tall and loud to be a director; there are other models.</p> <p>\"A lot is riding on the power and input of the director. You are the one to coax the performances out of the actors. Directors control every aspect of the script, from the wallpaper to casting. I think women are uniquely qualified to do that because we are brilliant at multitasking.\"</p> <p>White was selected as best newcomer in 1987 by <em>Broadcast</em>, the industry magazine, on the basis of a documentary film, but she was only nominated as best new director by Women in Film &amp; Television, an international creative media organisation, in 2009, after making <em>Generation Kill</em> for HBO \u2013 produced by Andrea Calderwood, with an all-male cast \u2013 and two period dramas.</p> <p>Despite winning a Fulbright scholarship to study film at UCLA after graduating from Oxford University, she failed to win a place on a BBC training scheme and was turned down for a BBC drama director trainee course in 1999 after 12 years spent making well-received documentaries for BBC2. \"I remember someone on the selection panel saying, 'What makes you think you can control 100 people?'\"</p> <p>She was supported second time around by BBC2 controller Jane Root, who eased her into drama in 2001 with a \u00a3200,000 budget drama for BBC2, <em>Love Again</em>, about Philip Larkin. Producer Nigel Stafford-Clark saw it and engaged her as director for BBC1's <em>Bleak House</em>. She also directed <em>Jane Eyre</em> in 2006, starring Ruth Wilson, and the film <em>Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang</em> in 2010.</p> <p>Delyth Thomas, who directed CBBC's <em>Tracy Beaker</em>, is on the board of Directors UK and part of its women's working group. She said: \"It is certainly the case that careers in directing are different for women than men.\" Women, she said, \"tended to move sideways rather than up the chain\". This meant they could miss out on the most lucrative work. \"I have turned up on productions to be met with a gasp, 'Oh my God, you're a woman'\u2026 so I look at my tits and say, 'Yes, I am!'\"</p> <p>Calderwood, who is managing director of Slate Films, said momentum was building in favour of women, but all directors needed enormous confidence. \"You do have to be able to stand up in front of 150 people and say, 'This is the way we're doing it, my way'. You don't need to scream and shout. There isn't a bias against women, but you need an almost maniacal approach. Film sets are the most hierarchical place in the world, where only one person's opinion matters.\"</p> <p>White also believes that gender counts when it comes to on-screen interpretation: she introduced sympathetic overtones to the main female characters in <em>Parade's End</em>, and adjusted Sir Tom Stoppard's script to include a suffragette protest in the first episode.</p> <p>Sylvia, the wife of uptight Christopher Tietjens (Benedict Cumberbatch), who is played by Rebecca Hall, was once described by Graham Greene as \"surely the most possessed evil character in the modern novel\u2026 a witchwife\". But she is portrayed by White as a trapped, vulnerable woman.</p> <p>\"She could have been a harridan figure. I made her multilayered, a victim of circumstances. It's a big change from the book.\"</p>",
  "<p>The only constant is constant change. Teachers beyond a certain age develop a condition known as innovation fatigue. I've witnessed it many times; scores of teachers at some local authority launch exchanging glances, gently shaking their heads. The process begins with a department head attending some hotel training horror show at which they're provided with shiny booklets explaining \"what everyone needs to start doing next\". This is typically a new assessment framework presented in the form of pages and pages of grids. There's never an author to these documents, just the logo of whatever they've decided to call the education department that year.</p> <p>So then our hapless hero gets a slot at the next department meeting to explain \"what everyone needs to start doing next\". Anyone who objects is understandably seen as being unhelpful, and told to suck it up so everyone can go home. And on it goes. It's a hopelessly inefficient top down trickle of ever changing info-treacle, and it never, ever stops.</p> <p>I'm not saying no-one should man the tiller. I'm merely asking \u2013 what credentials have Michael Gove or Stephen Twigg to run an education system? What evidence is there that politicians are better suited to the job than somebody with relevant experience and qualifications, a headteacher say, or a professor? Politicians can't be blamed for tinkering; the levers are within their reach. But the short-term nature of electoral politics blights meaningful progress, endlessly rewriting the script and tearing up at least as many good ideas as are set in place. So let's move the levers beyond their reach.</p> <p>In their 2010 manifesto, the Lib Dems had a policy to pass an Education Freedom Act. Characteristically thin on detail, it promised to \"prevent politicians from meddling in the affairs of education\". A noble aim, but it begs the question: how would it work?</p> <p>Well, how about this: with a teaching qualification comes the right to vote for the, not education secretary, let's call it head of the profession for now. These voting rights could be extended to others with relevant credentials \u2013 academics, high level teaching assistants, whoever. Every five years there's a series of elections, carried out in schools, to decide who's going to be head of the profession for the next five years. There could be one election a month over four months, starting with choosing a school representative, then at the local authority level, then at the regional level, and finally at the national level. That person can serve two terms in public office if they get re-elected \u2013 having the opportunity to set in place a 10-year plan \u2013 and then they must return to the profession, or move on.</p> <p>A common criticism is that it wouldn't be fair to people who aren't teachers, because you're denying them a vote on something that affects them. But we don't get to choose the education secretary now, do we? We vote for our local constituency MP, and the secretaries of state are appointed from the political elite. So this idea extends the democratic model to make it so that people who know what they're talking about, can choose from a list of people who know what they're talking about, based on ideas discussed and debated in any number of forums.</p> <p>The main problem with this idea, as far as I can see, is that it doesn't stop with education. By empowering the professions to elect their own leaders, we would have healthcare professionals running the NHS, economists running the economy, engineers running transport systems and so on, with politicians holding them all to account. How's that for a 'big society'?</p> <p><em>This week's Secret Teacher works in an academy in the south of England.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka are unwittingly, perhaps, damaging women's tennis with their dreadful, premeditated caterwauling. This is hardly an original thought but it needs repeating, like their screeching, over and over again.</p> <p>To listen to them in yesterday's first semi-final at Flushing Meadows was to survive the tennis equivalent of water-boarding. Sooner or later (or maybe already) people will stop coming to watch this peculiar self-indulgence. Some already have. A few fans here left their expensive seats early, and those who stayed were noticeably mute, mesmerised by the noise rather than the tennis, which resulted in a weird atmosphere of ear-bashing on court and stupified silence in the stands.</p> <p>Azarenka even screamed after losing a point. I wonder if they practise this? Do they do it at home? Have they ever sat through someone else's screaming? Would they like it if we did it to them? Do they give a flying monkey's?</p> <p>Sharapova won the first set 115 grunts to 94, and six games to three. It was unbearable. On both counts.</p> <p>It probably doesn't do to get a fixation about this, but the aural assault in women's tennis is impossible to ignore \u2013 especially when someone working for the host broadcaster goes to the trouble of counting the shrieks of two such high-profile offenders. Revealingly, CBS showed tape of both women warming up \u2013 and there wasn't a peep out of either of them. So, if they can hit the ball without screaming, why do they do it?</p> <p>One theory is they have been conditioned to do so from a young age so they give full expression to their shot-making.</p> <p>The Women's Tennis Association have asked juniors to try to control their grunting and screaming, but have made no such effort to do so where most of us can hear it, on the Tour. Who would dare ask the darling of the game, Sharapova, to tone it down when she generates such big numbers for TV, sponsors and tournament organisers?</p> <p>Anyway, she might not even be listening...</p> <h2>Another set please?</h2> <p>If ever there was a counter-argument to John McEnroe's call for women to play five sets if they want to earn the same prizemoney as the men in slams, it was played out on Arthur Ashe Court yesterday.</p> <p>The first semi-final went two hours and 42 minutes. The second semi-final went 64 minutes. Had Serena Williams been asked to continue her slaughter of Sara Errani, the embarrassment would have been excruciating.</p> <p>There are still way too many bagels and 6-1 scores deep into major tournaments and it is often only the best players who can give each other a proper fight.</p> <p>While it would have been intriguing to see Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka carry on to decide it over five sets, I'm pretty sure Errani wanted to get out of there when she did.</p>",
  "<p>Plans to create a neo-liberal start-up city in Honduras with its own laws, tax rules and police force suffered a setback on Friday when the economic guru who inspired the project said he has been unable to act as its guarantor and watchdog.</p> <p>Paul Romer, an influential professor at New York University, is seen as crucial to the credibility of the plan, which aims to transform enclaves in the Central American nation into magnets for investors similar to Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Singapore.</p> <p>But days after the deal was announced, Romer said he had not been given the powers and information necessary to fulfil his role as chairman of the transparency commission, which is meant to ensure governance of the new development zones.</p> <p>Romer said he and four other international figures were appointed by presidential decree to the commission, which has wide-ranging powers to appoint and fire governors, nominate judges and hire auditors in the proposed new zones. But the five will issue a statement distancing themselves from this week's announcement and calling into question the legality of their appointment, which they say has not been published in the official gazette as required by Honduran law, ostensibly because of a challenge in the constitutional court.</p> <p>\"Thus the conditions have not existed to permit the transparency commission to play the role envisioned for this ambitious and important project,\" they write in an open letter to President Porfirio Lobo Sosa, to be released online. \"As you continue to work to attract foreign investment ... in this period of uncertainty, we feel it would be wise to release you from any sense of obligation to proceed with publication of the decree and thus with our formal appointment.\"</p> <p>Romer said he was surprised to hear the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/honduras-new-city-laws-investors?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">announcement</a> this week that the Honduran government had signed a $14m memorandum of understanding with the business consortium NKG. \"We're not involved in any discussions with anyone involved in this deal. Our statement is an attempt to clarify to the public what our role is. At the moment the commission does not exist, we do not have any information, or means to check or look into any aspect of the negotiation... We cannot serve the guarantor or endorser function the commission was that supposed to provide.\"The five commission members said they continued to support the project and were willing to work with the government in the future. But their lack of involvement at this initial state is likely to alarm potential investors.</p> <p>The Honduran administration said the issue was overblown. \"This was not a legally binding agreement. It was a memorandum of understanding,\" said presidential adviser, Octavio Sanchez.</p> <p>\"We want the area to become a successful place so the models that work there can be adopted elsewhere. It's not an isolated island of success. It is an inspiration for others to follow. It is a showcase.\"</p> <p>Government officials said earlier this week that the project was the most important in Honduras for 50 years and would start in October. However, Sanchez said that everything must await a ruling by the Supreme Court, which could take anything from a week to 10 years.</p> <p>Romer's plans to build \"charter cities\" \u2013 which are envisaged as ideal locations for wealth creation \u2013 have long been controversial. Critics fear they may become states-within-states for a privileged elite, worsening inequality and bypassing labour and environmental laws.</p> <p>But Honduras' new plan may go a step further, due to the influence of radical libertarians who are now talking of creating \"private cities\".</p> <p>Romer appeared unsure what direction the government was taking: \"I don't know what people mean when they refer to private cities. But if it suggests that there will be no institutions or government, then I fear that misses the essential requirement for successful urbanisation. I would be concerned about how a private attempt to provide things like policing services could be held accountable.\"</p>"
