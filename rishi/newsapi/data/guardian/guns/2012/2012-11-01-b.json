We need leadership from the White House \u2013 and over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney, in contrast, has \"reversed course\" on his previous support for policies to tackle climate change.</p> <p>The irony here is that climate change has barely been mentioned at all during the election campaign, and was never mentioned by name during the presidential debates. In the Republican primaries, candidates queued up to pour scorn on the very notion of man-made climate change. And now Bloomberg has made their party \u2013 which he was once a member of \u2013 pay the ultimate political price.</p> <p>Bloomberg then fires a lethal shot at Romney:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results. In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the health-care model he signed into law in Massachusetts.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Interestingly, a close reading of Bloomberg essay makes it seem that he was planning to endorse Obama before Sandy. If that's true then presumably he was planning to punish the Republican party's war on climate change even before Sandy's unwanted attention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9ee9e396-0b0b-4a70-a9b2-0667b3eeb7de\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351800259417/Barack-Obama-and-Michael--007.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Michael Bloomberg in 2008\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama and Michael Bloomberg at a breakfast meeting in 2008.

Of course, he knows in current circumstances no sane person would really push defence spending, projected to fall below 3% of GDP, to 4%; of course President Romney would strike a deal that raises overall tax revenues, even if he cuts tax rates.</p> <p>However, even if you accept that Romneynomics may be more numerate in practice than it is in theory, it is far harder to imagine that he will reverse course entirely. When politicians get elected they tend to do quite a lot of the things they promised during their campaigns. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, France\u2019s famously pliable new president, was supposed to be too pragmatic to introduce a 75% top tax rate, yet he is steaming ahead with his plan. We weren\u2019t fooled by the French left; we see no reason why the American right will be more flexible.

Internal surveys conducted for candidates like George Allen in Virginia, Richard Mourdock in Indiana and Josh Mandel in Ohio draw much rosier conclusions than polls conducted for their Democratic counterparts Tim Kaine, Joe Donnelly and Sherrod Brown. And media surveys, at least in Virginia and Ohio, show Kaine and Brown winning (restrictive Indiana laws make polling prohibitively expensive there).</p> <p>Republicans say their party is a victim of media bias \u2013 but not in the standard Lamestream Media sort of way. Pollsters on both sides try to persuade public surveyors that their voter turnout models are more accurate reflections of what's going to happen on Election Day. This year, GOP pollsters and strategists believe those nonpartisan pollsters are adopting Democratic turnout models <em>en masse</em>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Reid's conclusion:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Republicans believe Democrats are counting far too much on low-propensity voters and a booming minority turnout that isn't going to materialize on Election Day. Democrats believe Republicans are hopelessly reliant on an electorate that looks far more like their party than the nation as a whole. The day after Election Day, somebody's pollsters are going to be proven seriously wrong.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T17:05:24.997Z\">at 5.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5092a8b695cb1506d24446df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T16:52:06.508Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Obama for America is back on the offensive with another smack at <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>'s \"let Detroit go bankrupt\" comment.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP41ogzwsBk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FP41ogzwsBk?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There's no telling how much damage a dumb remark can do \u2013 and this is an example of something that was never an issue in the GOP primary \u2013 Romney won <strong>Michigan</strong> \u2013 but blows up big time in the general election.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5092a3bfb579f74bac7648de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T16:30:55.588Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nate Silver v Joe Scarborough</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For fans of media-politics inside baseball: Many <strong>Republicans</strong> and <strong>Politico</strong> have been engaged in bizarre guerrilla warfare aimed at the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\">New York Times' polling guru</a> <strong>Nate Silver</strong>, whose election model was the only thing keeping the Democratic party from headless panic while the Romney surge was at its height last month.</p> <p>The motivations of the those involved at throwing mud at Silver is suspect \u2013 the Republicans because it punctures their narrative of inevitable Mittmentum and Politico because of jealousy.

  "<p>If you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/forecasterenten\">follow me</a> on Twitter (which you should), you'll see me tweet out a lot of new polls. But I rarely write daily updated articles here about the movement of the polls. Why?</p> <p>It's not that this isn't a worthy cause. There are plenty of people who write pearls of wisdom on each new set of polling data. Rather, it's because I don't want to spend my time saying the same thing over and over again.</p> <p>There are certain years where the polls bounce up and down, and we really don't know what's going to happen. In <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/white.htm\">2000</a>, the polls were quite bouncy, and we saw a Gore lead give way to a Bush lead \u2013 and vice versa, more times than I can count. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Presidential_04/oh_polls.html\">2004</a>, John Kerry held a lead in the pivotal state of Ohio as late as 20 days into the month of October, before Bush regained an edge he never lost.</p> <p>Then there are other years where the polls are fairly static. The outcome of the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/us-presidential-election-center.aspx\">1992, 1996 and 2008</a> campaigns were fairly clear by October. The Democratic candidate was going to win, and by a fairly comfortable margin.</p> <p>This year, the national polls have indicated a fairly tight race, yet in the states \u2013 where the election will be lost and won \u2013 polls denote a race that is more stable than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/oct/18/alex-rodriguez-decline-new-york-yankees\">A-Rod's lack of clutch</a> in the post-season.</p> <p>Check out this chart from HuffPollster tracking the latest data from state to rule all others Ohio:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398723711\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351810109623/Ohio_460.jpg\" alt=\"Ohio polling\" width=\"460\" height=\"222\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huffpollster tracking in Ohio (the blue line is Obama's poling; the red, Romney's)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You see the race tighten after the first debate, but since that initial tightening, there has been no change.

Anyone who says they see either Obama or Romney gaining ground in the states (save Nevada) is selling you a sack of nothing.</p> <p>Thus, the only way Romney can win is <em>if the average of the polls is wrong</em>. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/01/presidential-polls_n_2056377.html?utm_hp_ref=@pollster\">Mark Blumenthal over at HuffPollster</a> is going to do a whole series on what could go wrong with the polls, and I invite you to read his thoughts if you want to get into the nitty-gritty.</p> <p>Still, let me outline three possible reasons that the aggregates might not be telling the whole truth.</p> <p>First, averages do occasionally get a race wrong \u2013 usually, one per cycle. It could be that Ohio is the state where the polls are wrong this time around \u2013 although I have my doubts, because usually, the state that is incorrectly called is one where the polling average is within 1 point, such as <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/co/colorado_romney_vs_obama-2023.html\">Colorado</a> or <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/va/virginia_romney_vs_obama-1774.html\">Virginia</a> are this time around.</p> <p>The exact odds that it is Ohio might be higher than I have thought, though. Simon Jackman <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-jackman/converting-a-poll-average_b_2044222.html?utm_hp_ref=@pollster\">utilized historical data</a>, and if we factor in a lot of uncertainty in the polls, he still has Obama as a 2:1 favorite in Ohio and, thus, the electoral college. This two-thirds chance is almost certainly under-confident, but it's not insane to think a Romney reversal could happen.</p> <p>Second, there does seem to be a bit of an unequal distribution in the polling in Ohio. Whether if it's because of random error or different turnout models, my friend <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/morning-jay-polling-quandary-buckeye-state_659852.html\">Jay Cost argues</a> that there are two peaks in the Ohio polls. One peak shows that Obama will win Ohio by 4 or more points and the other has a tied race. In other words, the average isn't a useful measure.</p> <p>I was initially skeptical of Jay's argument. My own examination of <a href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/441/screenshot20121101at132.png/\">all the data </a>suggests that there does seem to be a peak at around a 2- to 2.5-point Obama lead in Ohio. When I looked back at <a href=\"http://imageshack.us/scaled/landing/5/screenshot20121101at132.png\">2008 data</a>, however, the distribution was more normal. That is, the average point was a convergence of the majority of the data. This year, it does seem to be spread out in its peaks.</p> <p>Third, Rasmussen Reports is correct and pretty much everyone else is wrong. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/31/other-2012-election-contest-pollster-polling\">discussed earlier</a>, the only pollster in the past few weeks to have Romney ahead in Ohio and tied in Wisconsin is Rasmussen. Rasmussen has had some years, like 2004 and 2006, when they were among the best. They also had 2010, when they were way off. </p> <p>There's always the chance an outlier like Rasmussen sees something others miss. There's a better chance, though, that the outlier is wrong.</p> <p>All of this is to say that you shouldn't anticipate much in the way of presidential horserace coverage from me in the next few days. There's pretty much no chance the polls will change outside a last-minute scandal. Either the surveys are either right in projecting President Obama's re-election, or the story will be how wrong they were. We'll find out which soon enough.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 It is not enough for these eco campaigners to have the will to occupy gas and power stations. They've got to have the knowhow, which they have in spades; but, crucially, they have to have the gear. This week 11 activists from the group No Dash for Gas successfully scaled a 91m (300ft) metal chimney at a gas-fired power station in West Burton, Nottinghamshire. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/29/climate-activists-west-burton-gas\" title=\"\">Another six occupied a second one that was not yet in use, securing themselves on ledges</a>. How did that happen? Cast back to 2009 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/14/police-arrests-environment-campaigners\" title=\"\">and the attempted invasion of Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station</a>, also in Nottinghamshire. That was thwarted as the result of infiltration of a protest group by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans/2012/jul/16/mark-kennedy-spying-on-drax-activists\" title=\"\">libidinous undercover policeman Mark Kennedy</a>. A pre-emptive raid uncovered the plan and loads of the protesters' equipment, including hard hats, climbing harnesses, ropes and sleeping bags. Well, as you know, the secret and carnal activities of Kennedy came to light, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/20/police-spy-on-climate-activists-unlawful\" title=\"\">resulting in all convictions arising from the Ratcliffe-on-Soar prosecutions being quashed</a>; and as a byproduct of that fiasco, the police were obliged to return the confiscated equipment. Much of which was used for this week's occupation in West Burton. But isn't that the great thing about our police. Always there to help.</p> <p>\u2022 After the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/cameron-commons-defeat-eu-budget\" title=\"\">humiliating loss of that vote on the EU budget</a>, meanwhile, the blame game begins in earnest. Big Dave has had three chief whips since ascending to leadership of the country. But, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/19/in-praise-of-philip-cowley\" title=\"\">political analyst Philip Cowley pointed out</a> on talk radio station LBC 97.3, two of the three have manifestly failed him. In 2011 Patrick McLoughlin, since exiled to transport, lost a vote on the state of the economy \u2013 the government was defeated by 213 votes to 79. And the incumbent, Sir George Young, has his fingerprints on the latest debacle. The only chief whip Dave could trust was Andrew Mitchell, whose record for herding and bullying colleagues remained unblemished. But he started swearing at the wrong people. The stuff of tragedy.</p> <p>\u2022 But then, the lot of a chief whip was never a particularly happy one. We see that at the National Theatre, where politicos are rushing to the Cottesloe to see <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/this-house\" title=\"\">This House</a>, a play about the whips offices in the 1970s. As Labour and Tory whips scheme and plot, the audience watches from benches positioned to replicate government and opposition in the Commons. And on Tuesday, one of the visitors was the former MP <a href=\"http://www.johnhoram.com/\" title=\"\">John Horam</a>. The question, where would he sit? For Horam was elected for Labour, defected to the SDP and then migrated to the Tories, for whom he represented Orpington in Kent until the last election. He opted for the Labour benches, where he sat in the 70s when the action was unfolding. Presumably for old times' sake.</p> <p>\u2022 The squeeze is on and money's tight, but if the Met's really that hard up, wouldn't it make sense for it to sell the contents of the Crime Museum at New Scotland Yard, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/30/scotalnd-yard-sell-met-costs?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">rather than the building itself</a>? It's worth millions. There are now websites such as murderauction.com that sell such stuff \u2013 their slogan is \"every man has to have a hobby\", a quote from an old murderer and bodysnatcher called Ed Gein. What the Met has got \u2013 items from Dr Crippen, the Krays, death masks from people hanged at Newgate and so on \u2013 would bring in loads of cash on eBay and elsewhere. A roulette wheel from one of the Krays' old clubs has recently been valued at \u00a35,000. Think what the cooker belonging to serial killer Dennis Nilsen, his partner in grisly crimes, would be worth.</p> <p>\u2022 Yes, the squeeze is on and amid the perils of life in the economic downturn, more advice from Spear's, <a href=\"http://www.spearswms.com/in-this-issue/\" title=\"\">the magazine for the super wealthy</a>. Last year's riots may have been just a precursor to nastier happenings. If the revolution starts, they'll take everything, says the magazine. \"Although revolution seems unlikely, art collectors should be under no illusion that, were it ever to happen, their art would be a target, irrespective of their nationality or background; and revolutionaries have tended to find that the easiest way to deal with the owners of art they confiscate has been to execute them by axe (Charles I), guillotine (Louis XVI) or firing squad (Tsar Nicholas).\" Nasty.

  "<p>\"The third coming of Berg\" was how Blackburn's ever-quotable global adviser Shebby Singh heralded Henning's arrival as Rovers manager. The Norwegian won Premier League and League Cup titles during two stints as a player at Ewood Park but those notable achievements will be eclipsed should he heal a divided club and lift it out of the Championship at the first attempt.</p> <p>Singh left no one, least of all Berg, in any doubt as to what Venky's want from their choice to succeed the calamitous Steve Kean as manager. \"Promotion is the minimum and the maximum,\" he said of this season's target. \"We have emphasised that time and again but the most important thing is that Henning welcomes the pressure, he welcomes the challenge. He didn't sit in front of us and say: 'I need three years to build a team or two seasons to get them promoted.' He said: 'I know what you want and I want to be the man to deliver that.'\"</p> <p>The initial reaction to Berg's appointment among Blackburn supporters suggests judgment is reserved on that score, though no one disputes the 43-year-old must succeed following the club's rapid decline since Venky's bought control two years ago. Lessons have been learned. Berg will not have to make regular trips to visit Venky's owner Anuradha Desai in India, as Kean did, and will have a greater say on transfer targets, as Kean allegedly did not.</p> <p>Rovers' new manager needed to do his own repair work before signing a three-year contract having delivered a scathing assessment of Venky's following the club's relegation in May. Working as a television pundit in Norway, Berg had said: \"There are no real managers with credibility who would accept a job like that.\"</p> <p>As the man who accepted that job, he now explains: \"Those comments were made by me looking in from the outside. Now I know what is happening on the inside and I know what the owners have done in the summer. They are making big decisions. They are putting money in and buying players like Leon Best, Jordan Rhodes, Danny Murphy, Dickson Etuhu and Nuno Gomes; big, important players for this team. They are showing their intent by changing the management as well. They are taking the club in the right direction, looking to make sure this club gets back into the Premier League.\"</p> <p>Berg started his managerial career with three productive seasons at Lyn before a difficult period at Lillestrom ended in dismissal last year. \"They had been going for the championship when the economic crisis set in and then really struggled financially,\" he says of Lillestrom. \"We had to halve the costs. I suppose my biggest achievement as manager was making more money for the owners than we spent.\"</p> <p>Concern at Venky's running of Blackburn was not eased by the five weeks it took to appoint Kean's successor. Berg was one of five names on a list eventually compiled by Singh, the managing director Derek Shaw and the press officer turned general manager Paul Agnew after failing to secure Tim Sherwood's release from Tottenham Hotspur. Harry Redknapp, Ian Holloway, Gus Poyet and Huddersfield's Simon Grayson were the others, although Poyet was reluctant to leave Brighton and talks with Redknapp's representatives broke down. Diego Maradona was even linked at one point. \"Come on,\" said Singh to that invented tale. \"He wouldn't want to consider us even if we were interested.\"</p> <p>As for Redknapp, Singh added: \"It was important to meet Harry's representatives and to tell them where we were coming from and where the speculation was coming from because sometimes that can be very detrimental. In no way the club wanted to be in a situation where we upset Harry by what was said in the media. We had a very constructive discussion and we move on.\"</p> <p>Singh insisted a thorough managerial search was required to guarantee there was no repeat of the mistake with Kean. Singh's explanation of how they ultimately arrived at Berg, however, did not suggest that he was an early frontrunner.</p> <p>Singh, who claimed a legal dispute over the manner of Kean's exit had been resolved, said: \"We looked at three different categories. We looked at the wise old head; the senior men, then we looked at the middle group; who have been in management enough, who have tasted success and failure, and then we looked at the third group; the young, vibrant, dynamic modern-thinking manager who could possibly be the next best thing. I think that is no different from what most top clubs in the world do.</p> <p>\"I always cite Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as an example. In 2002, Porto said 'you are the man.' AVB [Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas] in 2010, J\u00fcrgen Klopp in Borussia Dortmund in 2008, so that was the third category. I think we have found a manager in Henning who is in the middle group and is also in the third group, so we have got a mixture of both.\"</p>",
  "<p>Somewhere in the corridors of the Royal Courts of Justice, Sir Brian Leveson is toiling away on his keenly awaited report into the ethics and standards of the British press. Even at this late stage \u2013 the white smoke is expected within a few weeks \u2013 there is much furious lobbying, both by those who wish Lord Justice Leveson to turn the statutory thumbscrews on journalists and, on the other side, by those who believe that the judge may be set on sweeping away 200 years or more of press freedom.</p> <p>Into the midst of this heady atmosphere has burst <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">the Jimmy Savile story</a> \u2013 which has been&#xa0;instantly seized on by all sides to prove one point or another. Savile can be a clarion call for an unshackled press or, seen differently, it can demonstrate that statutory regulation is hardly an obstacle to robust investigative journalism (the story was, after all, broken by&#xa0;Ofcom-regulated ITV). In other hands it&#xa0;can&#xa0;demonstrate how admirably transparent the BBC is, or else can be used to&#xa0;prove that the corporation \u2013 which is probably the&#xa0;most&#xa0;trusted and admired news organisation in the world \u2013 is in fact utterly corrupt and contemptible and in need of a Leveson inquiry all of its own.</p> <h2><strong>Middle ground</strong></h2> <p>The debate has, in other words, become a little overheated \u2013 particularly given that few, if any, have any idea what Sir Brian actually has in mind and that the judge is unlikely to be much impressed by vocal last-minute campaigning by either side. He presumably well understands that the lobbying is less aimed at him as at the politicians who will, in time, have to reach a decision on his recommendations.</p> <p>From his own pronouncements and questions while his inquiry was sitting, we can hazard a guess that Sir Brian is likely to be examining the middle ground between the two extremes being urged on him. There is real opportunity in this space, otherwise known as independent regulation.</p> <p>Sir Brian can build on the real progress made by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Black,_Baron_Black_of_Brentwood\" title=\"\">Lord Black</a> in outlining a new system of regulation which enjoys widespread support across the press. This proposal is not, as its critics claim, the status quo. It promises real investigations, tough sanctions and a commitment to the enforcement of standards that its predecessor, the PCC, did not have. It is, as drafted, far from perfect. It vests too much power in an industry funding body which retains key powers over the regulator, especially the ability to appoint the press members of key committees. Students of the PCC \u2013 and of how it came to produce such a lamentable response to the phone-hacking scandal \u2013 will know these are the very mechanics of the old discredited system. Leveson will surely reject them, as would parliament.</p> <h2><strong>Use of statute</strong><br></h2> <p>But there is still merit in the outline Black plan, which goes some way to solving the so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/16/richard-desmond-mediaguardian-100-2012\" title=\"\">Richard Desmond</a> problem \u2013 the fear that major publishers could undermine the system by simply leaving it \u2013 by requiring all publishers over a certain size to sign a five-year contract. Critics argue that this is insufficiently enduring. But this is where Leveson's idea of adding an arbitral arm to the regulator for legal press complaints could be critical. The arbitral wing would give cheap and quick justice to complainants and publishers alike. It would reward those in the system by offering legal defences and lower penalties.</p> <p>Some observers point out that such an arbitral system would need to be enshrined in law with the press regulator recognised in statute. That may be true, but this use of statute merely builds on the precedent of <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/section/12\" title=\"\">section 12 of the Human Rights Act</a>, which asks judges to consider regulatory codes in their deliberations over free expression. For the press to oppose such a limited use of statute as a matter of principle would seem to be counter-productive. This creation of a quick and simplified arbitral system \u2013 along with the defamation bill currently wending its way through parliament \u2013 would do much to address the scandal of Britain's libel laws as well as making the new regulatory system work. One of the most important media lessons about Jimmy Savile may be that, while there was nothing in regulation to stop newspapers exposing Savile during his lifetime, there was plenty to deter them in the libel laws.</p> <p>Some of the victims of hacking are, understandably, sceptical about any voluntary system. We sympathise with these concerns. But the trouble with compulsory regulation is that, in the wrong hands, it could edge us back towards something that looks like the licensing of the press and of journalists \u2013 something that was abolished in the late 17th century and which has no place in a free society. <a href=\"http://inforrm.wordpress.com/2012/11/01/hacked-off-the-ft-and-the-campaign-for-no-change/\" title=\"\">Some counter that this is a baseless fear</a>, claiming that it would be possible to enshrine in law the regulator's independence from both government and the newspaper industry.</p> <p>These are reasonable arguments to make in reasonable times. But will we always live in such times? The question is whether, having once conceded parliament's right to lay down the law about the regulation of the press, a Rubicon has been crossed \u2013 at least politically. Europe may be on the brink of a period of social turbulence \u2013 with all the authoritarian responses that will almost inevitably follow. See this week's arrest of the Greek journalist <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/11/01/uk-greece-list-idUKBRE8A00MG20121101\" title=\"\">Costas Vaxevanis</a> for publishing the names of alleged tax evaders. And look at the fury recently directed by the press and MPs at the BBC's news operation and see how ugly the mood can turn against even the most ethical and professional news organisations.</p> <h2><strong>Independent regulation</strong><br></h2> <p>There are plenty of laws already affecting journalists in this country. The argument is sometimes advanced that \u2013 given these laws \u2013 we should just leave it to the police. But the phone-hacking saga revealed that Britain's largest police force behaved in an extraordinary way when confronted with the might of one immensely powerful newspaper group. The law on its own is not sufficient \u2013 which is why Leveson has to consider regulation and then ask searching questions about media plurality. He must help politicians see why no&#xa0;media baron must ever again be allowed&#xa0;to&#xa0;carve out the kind of dominance enjoyed for more than a generation by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</p> <p>Our own position remains as we argued it before the inquiry this summer. We believe in independent regulation, both from politicians and the press itself. We do believe in a contract system \u2013 not the use of statute \u2013 to secure participation. But we also believe in an arbitral arm which incentivises the regulated to pursue high standards and penalises anyone who walks away. We believe that the regulator must have real investigatory powers and sanctions. And, above all, we believe in the importance of plurality.</p>",
  "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this blog is for those watching Hunted on BBC1. Please do not read on if you haven't seen episode five. </em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/25/hunted-series-one-episode-four\" title=\"\">Julia Raeside's episode four blog</a></p> <p>This week's episode of Hunted was brought to you by the letters O, M and G. And by the number <em>what</em>? I can see what has happened here. Mr Spotnitz thought that around about episode five he'd better start giving us some answers to the many and complex questions set up in preceding weeks, before we all run into the street in our nighties, grabbing random strangers and asking them: \"Are you the mole?\"</p> <p>But instead of putting some pieces of the jigsaw into place, he has kicked the table away, sent the pieces flying and is now doing a morris dance on them, singing Saturday Night by Whigfield.</p> <p>Where are we up to? In summary: the building blew up, Aiden was knocked out, then he was OK. Sam wasn't murdered by the needle killer but just put to sleep. She was OK . Blank Face Man told Sam her life was in danger. She said: \"No shit.\" (I did laugh.)</p> <p>Deacon finally asked Aiden: \"Are you the mole?\" Yes! Then Aiden shot a window and escaped through it. Sam tried to kill Aiden. He told her: \"I found your hidden room, I know everything.\" FYI, Sam, anyone walking past could have found your hidden room because you <em>left the curtains open</em>.</p> <p>Deacon went to see his priest and purged his guilt about those two innocent people that Byzantium got murdered. Sam recognised the distinctive spires from her flashbacks and realised Hourglass was something to do with her childhood abduction and the murder of her mum.</p> <p>George got dart-gunned. Aiden and Sam duffed up a load more henchmen. When Sam got back to the Turners', Stephen asked her where she'd been so she snogged him as a diversion. Well, it worked with Conroy.</p> <p>This week was a mess, frankly, but let's pick through the debris and see if we can't find some sense in all the madness.</p> <h2>Things we now know (I think)</h2> <p>1. Blank Face Man is actually trying to help Sam, not kill her. He injected her in the eyeball with a sedative so he could have a chat with her. I'm pretty sure you can inject someone in their arm (or their bum if it's a Carry On film) and put them to sleep that way just as easily. The eyeball skewering is clearly just his signature \"thing\", like the Fonz's \"Ayyy\" and thumbs-up in Happy Days.</p> <p>2. Aiden is the mole.</p> <p>3. Hassan is/was also the mole. I paused this episode so many times and still I struggled to understand how Hassan was also the mole. But there it is. Go to your evidence collage. You may now draw whiskers and a shiny black nose on the photos of both Hassan and Aiden.</p> <p>4. Aiden's real name is not Aiden Marsh. We must therefore henceforth refer to him as \"Aiden\" because we don't know what he is really called. Nearly everyone in Hunted has more than one identity, which is ruining my colour-coding I can tell you.</p> <p>5. As pointed out by a commenter last week, Keel has a troublesome addiction to Settlers' Tums, not Refreshers as initially thought. He pops them at an alarming rate. If his acid reflux is that bad, he wants to step things up a gear and hit the Gaviscon. That'll sort him out.</p> <p>6. Thanks to that building blowing up, Jack Turner now has the extra \u00a330m he needs to buy the Khyber dam. Phew! In fact he even has \u00a32m in change which he can take straight down the Edinburgh Woollen Mill to buy himself some nice new polo-necks.</p> <p>7. Hourglass is all to do with a painting in the National Gallery. Actually, I think the painting needs its own section.</p> <h2>The painting</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\" title=\"\">The Ambassadors</a> by Hans Holbein the Younger (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ambassadors_%28Holbein%29\" title=\"\">you can totally look it up on Wikipedia</a>) is apparently full of clues about something or other but for the purposes of Hunted, it all points towards the origins of the mysterious Hourglass; an age-old secret organisation made up of the heads of private industry, sort of like Bilderberg but more evil and more ancient. The painting is famous because it's got a freaky skull painted in anamorphic perspective, like those adverts on rugby pitches. It must be a clue. Stick an anamorphic skull next to your mole pictures and await further instructions. George Ballard (RIP) explained all of this during his meeting with Sam and was then promptly dart-gunned, his purpose served.</p> <h2>Hat watch </h2> <p>There were no hats in episode five. I repeat: Sam remained hatless throughout. Total curve-ball for hat watch. But I can report that her hair, free from the woolly confines of previous episodes, did get curlier and curlier, almost acting as some kind of pathetic fallacy for the increasingly tangled plot.</p> <h2>Lines of the week </h2> <p>She wins it every week, but once again it has to be Zoe \u2013 Expositionbot 3000 \u2013 with this zinger: \"Turner's going to be looking for the woman that saw him murder the professor then broke into Conroy's office. We have to make sure he finds her.\"</p> <p>And special mention must go to Jack Turner for saying this when someone says Fowkes (\"Gary\") reminds him of Turner's dead son: \"I'll tell you what, Gary, I hope you don't end up dead, cut to pieces with your dick stuffed in your mouth.\" So good, they used it twice.</p> <p>On receiving the souvenir clogs from Zoe after her visit to Amsterdam, Fowkes niggled: \"What about the cheese then?\" His fixation with dairy continues. What <em>is</em> his problem?</p> <h2>Next time</h2> <p>\u2022 Sam visits the doctor she rescued in Tangier in episode one to ask him about Hourglass. \"I don't know anything about this,\" he says, looking genuinely confused. \"You're a poor liar, Doctor,\" murmurs Sam. I'm not even sure it's the same guy. She just harasses the nearest bystander now, demanding to know what they know.</p> <p>\u2022 The Turners junior and senior have some kind of set-to about \"respect\". That's not going to end well.</p> <p>\u2022 Sam beats up a load of people in a modernist atrium, as per.</p> <p>\u2022 Fowkes' Chas and Dave act looks to have been rumbled when Tyrone points a gun at him.</p> <p>\u2022 And Sam can be seen diving towards Meera Syal in a head scarf and shouting \"Get doooooown\" as they both fall to the floor.</p> <p>Do you feel slightly like someone has been sticking a needle into your brain or are you with it sufficiently to record your thoughts in the comments below?

  "<p>New York City's mayor Michael Bloomberg took climate change out of the closet on Thursday by invoking the issue in his endorsement of Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"This November, vote for a president who will lead on climate change,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeBloomberg/status/264080226886221824\">Bloomberg wrote on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>The stunning snub to Mitt Romney, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, at a stroke turned climate change from liability into a potentially winning political issue in this presidential election.</p> <p>It might even embolden other Republicans, who do support action on climate change, to come out of the closet as well. At least, that seems to be partly Bloomberg's intention.</p> <p>The real test of power will be whether Obama makes climate change part of his standard stump speech \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/01/obama-strategy-silence-climate-change\">something that has been notably lacking so far</a> \u2013 and whether Republicans dare to admit a connection between Sandy and climate change.</p> <p>Obama, in his response to the endorsement, relegated climate change to a lesser item on his list. For Bloomberg it was the focal point as a result of the disaster that has struck his city.</p> <p>\"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the north-east \u2013 in lost lives, lost homes and lost business \u2013 brought the stakes of next Tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief,\" Bloomberg wrote. \"Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it may be \u2014 given the devastation it is wreaking \u2014 should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.\"</p> <p>Businessweek, which is owned by Bloomberg, made the point even more trenchantly with a cover reading: \"It's global warming, stupid.\"</p> <p>But Bloomberg made a point of rebuking Romney for abandoning his own record on climate change, as governor of Massachusetts, in an effort to win over conservative Republicans. The New York mayor also praises Obama for his efforts on climate change in the White House.</p> <p>\"Over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks,\" Bloomberg said.</p> <p>The mayor went on to invoke the administration's moves to clean up coal-fired power plants \u2013 which have been vigorously opposed by Republicans \u2013 before citing his own efforts on climate change.</p> <p>Then comes the swipe at the Republican contender. \"Mitt Romney, too, has a history of tackling climate change \u2026 He couldn't have been more right. But since then, he has reversed course.\"</p> <p>In the aftermath of Sandy, a number of Democrats including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and New York's governor Andrew Cuomo have begun talking publicly about climate change.</p> <p>The mention comes after an election season in which climate change has been strangely absent \u2013 to the frustration of campaigners and the bewilderment of European observers.</p> <p>For Obama, the silence was strategic. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/01/obama-strategy-silence-climate-change\">The White House saw climate change as a vulnerability for Obama</a>.</p> <p>Mitt Romney's most prominent mention of climate change was as a laugh line in his convention speech \u2013 an attempt to win over conservative Republicans.</p> <p>The Tea Party movement has turned climate denial into a litmus test of conservative credentials \u2013 and that has made climate change one of the most sharp divisions between Obama and Romney.</p> <p>But even Republicans who accept climate science are opposed to the kind of sweeping economic transformation required to prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming.</p> <p>George Pataki, the former governor of New York, argued it was the Democrats' focus on big solutions to climate change had set Republicans on edge. \"Part of it is a reaction to the stridency of some of the activists who really are looking to expand government power,\" he said.</p> <p>He said Obama's policies on climate change amounted to a \"massive power grab\".</p> <p>\"This president and his administration supported the Waxman-Markey bill that was horribly flawed \u2013 one more aimed at expanding government control over industry, generated government revenue, and extending favours to friends than at dealing with climate change.\"</p>",

(Realizing Every Dream) reverts to what Ne-Yo does best: lush soul that eloquently bares his feelings about love, loss and the downside of fame. All three are addressed on the opener, Cracks in Mr Perfect, which twangs with self-disgust: \"After this song you're gonna love me for my honesty or you're gonna hate me \u2026 20k&#xa0;on champagne in the club, then 20k more just because, that's 40k in just three hours.\" He's not boasting, he's recoiling at his lack of self-control. But it's redressed by his admiration for women, who are indomitable even during bedroom tussles, such as the one described in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0ZTVlOFZv8\" title=\"\">Lazy Love</a>. His honeyed tenor glides through slow jams and bangers alike,&#xa0;even bestowing sunshine on a&#xa0;metallic EDM collaboration with Calvin Harris, Let's Go.

  "<p>Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. </p> <h2>Keith Hackett's verdict</h2> <p><strong>1)</strong> Ignore their appeals: it is just opportunism. This was clearly a fair tackle and not a deliberate back pass \u2013 and this law is in place to prevent obvious time wasting, not brilliant defending. <em>Thanks to Bhavin Gawali</em>. <br><strong>2)</strong> Award the goal. There is no offence here: the ball had been blasted in on goal and, if it hits any player on any part of his body and goes into the net, it's a valid goal. Any appeals from the defenders for unsporting behaviour or excessive force are wrong: the taker has acted within the Laws of the game. Make sure the defender receives treatment, and a change of shirt if necessary, before allowing him to continue. <em>Andy Hatfield wins the shirt</em>. <br><strong>3)</strong> If this scenario sounds far-fetched, then you have never been a Sunday league referee: you need to be prepared for all sorts of bizarre challenges. I would allow the game to go ahead provided the surface is safe: clearly the ball is not going to run perfectly, but it is not a danger and it is the same for both teams.

  "<p>Oh good, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016kgww\" title=\"\"><strong>Young Apprentice</strong></a> (BBC1), more adorable little bonsai tossers. Here they come, to London, in their age-inappropriate clothes, with their little wheelie suitcases stuffed with ambition, to walk around below tall buildings, talking shite. The same shite as the older ones, but it's funnier when it comes out of little mouths.</p> <p>Someone will mention an animal soon, an apex predator. Here we go: Maria may look like a 5ft 1in blond angel, she says, but underneath she's a&#xa0;lioness who will take out anyone in her way. Grrrrr.</p> <p>Another one, shaggy Sean, had his first business when he was nine. Yeah, me too mate ... oh, hang on, mine wasn't a business come to think of it, it was a model aeroplane. How did these kids get to be like this? And what will become of them? Hopefully they'll turn into potheads and go and live on a beach in Goa. Please can someone make a programme in 10 or 15 years' time: We Were the Young Apprentices.</p> <p>For now, though, they're tugging at their leashes, a pack of attack puppies crossing the wobbly bridge. Above them, ever present, the Shard thrusts skywards, a constant reminder of the way they must behave.</p> <p>Alan Sugar says he feels privileged, because none of them has walked into his boardroom staring into a smart phone ... Hello, is this one of his laboured, scripted, constipated jokes, straining to work its way out? \"For the next eight weeks, the only way you're going to be using phones is for business,\" he says. \"Not for playing Angry Birds. Because that will make me angry. And you don't want to make&#xa0;me angry, I can assure you.\" I do, I want to see him angry; go one Young Apprentice, play Angry Birds, make him angry.</p> <p>Hard to tell if that was a joke or not, to be honest. This must be, he's got that tell-tale look of concentration. \"Whoa, what a CV you've got here,\" he says to David. \"You're the chair of this, the chair of that, chair of something else, you're the chair of everything ... let's hope your colleagues don't just sit&#xa0;on you.\" Ha, good one, you got there in the end, Lord Sugar. What was&#xa0;it, take six?</p> <p>Apols if I'm being petulant, but I'm still cross with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lord_Sugar\" title=\"\">@Lord_Sugar</a> for blocking me on Twitter. And for what he said about Tulisa Contostavlos. \"Can you tell me who the hell this Tulisa bird is on X Factor,\" <a href=\"twitter.com/Lord_Sugar/status/236921532738318336\" title=\"\">he tweeted</a> (ha, you can block me, but I can still see). \"What has she done?\" Well, she sold well over a million albums with N Dubz alone. Also, Lord Sugar, with(out) respect, some birds don't like to be called birds, it makes them angry birds, especially if it's already part of an insult. It made Tulisa angry \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/officialtulisa/status/236928776532025344\" title=\"\">she called Sugar a twat</a>. I see he's just had a run-in with Louise Mensch too.</p> <p>Anyway, Sugar tells this lot of his own humble beginnings, as he always does \u2013 how he started at 17 with nothing, he was a boy, he had a barrow (rhymes with para), in the East End ... enough already, know it.</p> <p>Off they go, then, to sell secondhand clothes \u2013 the boys, Team Odyssey, and the girls, Team Platinum. \"They say when a piece of music goes platinum, that means it's sold a million,\" Sugar tells the girls back in the boardroom. (Yeah, like Tulisa, whoever she is). \"Do you reckon you've sold a million in this task?\" The girls \u2013 oh let's just call them the birds, why not? \u2013 haven't, but they've sold more than Odyssey, mainly because project leader Patrick spent too much time, effort and money attaching a vintage kimono to a wetsuit. \"Where would you wear that to?\" asks a woman in the shopping centre.</p> <p>Patrick probably should go, for the wetsuit alone, but Sugar fires posh Maximilian \u2013 more like a Harrow (doesn't rhyme with para) boy than a barrow (does) boy \u2013 instead. It's a shame; Max, who dabbles in pre-Socratic philosophers, would have been good value. A talker, though, not a doer, he's probably more suited to politics. In my We Were the Young Apprentices documentary, he'll probably be the Chancellor.</p> <p>No matter, there's still plenty of entertainment among the remainder. Sugar is still a twat. Nick Hewer still bobs around in the background, screwing his face up into a cat's bum. And Karren Brady ... well, who is this Karren bird anyway, what's she done?</p> <p>Ghastly, all of it. Yes, of course I'll watch the whole thing. Already looking forward to the next one.</p>",
  "<p>Down on the machair the temperature is unseasonably high and I'm certainly not envious of the group of crofters who, clad in wellies, waterproof dungarees and rubber gloves, are busily dunking a seemingly endless stream of resigned-looking animals at the sheep dip. The strength of the sunshine has brought out the warm herby smell characteristic of this stretch of the machair whatever the season, and here and there among the papery seed heads of the summer's yellow rattle and the dried angular heads of the umbellifers, a few last flowers are even now to be found.</p> <p>But it is around the margins of the family size potato patches that are ploughed into the machair amid the grassland and the long field strips that most of the flowers remain. By one is a great mass of mayweed, by another a show of corn marigold as bright as any found in the summer. The sheep dippers are not the only people at work this morning, for at many of the patches people are busy lifting potatoes.</p> <p>One couple has paused for a break, perched on their vehicle's tailgate. Flask&#xa0;by their side, they pass a single mug to and fro. At another a solitary worker, car radio playing softly in the background, lobs potatoes into a large black bucket. Farther along the track a pair of enthusiastic sheepdogs race towards me from where their owner is turning over the soil.</p> <p>He summons them back, shouts a cheerful hello and waves what appears to be a lethal weapon but turns out to be a potato hook in my direction. \"Will you take one of these?\" he asks, as he jabs the hook into the soil and heaves the lump over before raking through to expose the potatoes. The wooden handle is smooth and polished with years of use and I wonder if, like the one used by my friend's family, it has been passed on father to son, father to son.</p>",
  "<p>An exasperated Nick Clegg gave vent to months of frustration with the Tories on Thursday when he let rip at David Cameron for endangering Britain's membership of the EU by demanding a unilateral repatriation of powers from Brussels.</p> <p>In a sign of how the EU could destabilise the coalition, the deputy prime minister warned that Cameron was risking \"an outright crisis\" which could force Britain out of the EU. Hours later, Cameron hit back when he said he was confident he could repatriate powers.</p> <p>Clegg turned on the Tories in a speech at Chatham House in London after his patience finally snapped earlier this month when the education secretary, Michael Gove, said Britain should \"walk out\" if EU leaders refuse to sanction the repatriation of powers.</p> <p>\"A grand, unilateral repatriation of powers might sound appealing,\" the deputy prime minister said. \"But in reality it is a false promise wrapped in a union jack.\"</p> <p>Clegg launched a pre-emptive strike weeks before the prime minister outlines his plans to offer a referendum to the British people after the next general election after a successful repatriation of powers from the EU.</p> <p>Cameron will say that a majority Conservative government would use the British veto in any negotiations of the Lisbon treaty after the 2015 general election to demand the repatriation of powers across a range of areas. Downing Street expects the Lisbon treaty to be reopened on numerous occasions over the coming years to provide a legal basis for new eurozone governance arrangements.</p> <p>Clegg warned that such tactics could set Britain on a path to EU withdrawal. \"What you will never achieve is by stamping your foot and saying: 'Well, we want to be part of this club, but we kind of unilaterally want to rewrite the rules of the game and we want to pick and choose unilaterally what we're going to sign up to'.</p> <p>\"It's just not a realistic approach and my worry is there's a much shorter leap from that to an outright crisis which would leave the UK fully marginalised or even out of the European Union, than people seem to imagine.\"</p> <p>Downing Street said the prime minister was relaxed about Clegg's speech. \"It is no great surprise that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have different views on the EU,\" one source said.</p> <p>Cameron said he was confident he could repatriate powers. \"Let me be frank, I do believe it is possible to return powers from Brussels to Britain. Indeed, I have returned them \u2013 the bailout. We are now out of the bailout power that the last government put us into so we are not at risk in the way that we were of being called on to bail out other countries of Europe. That is the return of a power from Brussels to Britain achieved by this government.\"</p> <p>Clegg's speech shows that as leader of the Lib Dems, he is now determined to use the EU to portray himself as a centre ground figure between what he regards as Tory \"extremists\" and the Labour party.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister believes Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are using Europe in a cynical way to launch a tactical raid on the government after Labour joined forces with Tory Eurosceptics to defeat the government on the EU budget on Wednesday. Labour wants the next seven-year EU budget, due to run from 2014-2020, to be cut below the rate of inflation.</p> <p>Clegg and Cameron are united in calling for the budget to be frozen in line with inflation. Lib Dem sources were relaxed about what some saw as the curious position of the prime minister and deputy prime minister uniting around one EU position \u2013 on the budget \u2013 and then trading blow on another, the repatriation of powers. \"We are in the centre,\" one Lib Dem source said.</p> <p>The budget issue will return to the fore next week when Cameron meets Angela Merkel who on Thursday criticised Britain's threat to veto the budget if Cameron's fellow 26 EU leaders decline to accept the British proposal for a freeze at a summit later this month.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"If we don't get what I consider to be a good deal for Britain I have no hesitation in vetoing the multi-[annual] financial [framework].\"</p> <p>But the German chancellor said after a meeting with the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny: \"I don't want to throw more vetoes into the room, it doesn't help bring about a solution.\"</p> <p>Downing Street believes that EU leaders are unlikely to reach agreement on the budget at a summit on 22 and 23 November. They believe negotiations will have to be postponed until next year because other countries such as Denmark are also threatening to veto the budget. Denmark is demanding that its budget rebate is rolled over into the next seven-year period. Britain's rebate is automatically rolled over.</p> <p>The following EU summit in December will be dominated by the eurozone crisis when Cameron will face questions about which powers he will demand to be repatriated.</p> <p>In his speech, Clegg made clear he is spoiling for a more immediate fight with the prime minister over plans to opt out of around 130 EU law-and-order measures and then to opt back into a smaller number. Clegg agrees with Cameron that Britain should opt out of some measures. But under the Lisbon treaty Britain has to opt out of all the measures and then negotiate with its EU partners which measures to opt back into it. Clegg made clear that he will not agree to the opt out until he and Cameron have agreed on which measures to opt back into.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister indicated that he will give a veto to the police and MI5 which want to retain the European Arrest warrant and Europol. He said: \"We will led by the experts and the evidence at all time.\"</p> <p>Clegg added: \"To anyone who says we don't need these EU measures to fight crime and terrorism effectively, I say prove it.</p> <p>\"Prove it to the police, the intelligence agencies, the lawyers, the victims of crime charities. Prove it to the people who deal day in day out with the worst criminals imaginable. My position is clear: I will not ask them to protect the British people with one hand tied behind their back.\"</p>",

For the franchise's 23rd instalment lacks what some would have considered its quintessential ingredient.</p> <p>What used to distinguish 007 from previous thriller heroes was his unique&#xa0;brand of ironic detachment. <a href=\"http://www.ianfleming.com/the_books.asp\" title=\"\">Ian&#xa0;Fleming's books</a> demanded to be taken straight. The earlier <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jamesbond\" title=\"\">films</a> mocked their source material's vanity, as well as the thriller genre, love, death and Her Majesty's secret service. Their studied cheesiness mocked the mockery itself.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144416/skyfall\" title=\"\">Skyfall</a>, Daniel Craig's Bond delivers a scattering of old-style quips, but the chronic flippancy from which they used to spring has disappeared. Indeed, the film's lack of larkiness is the point of one of the cracks. Ben Whishaw's Q, favouring practicality over hilarity, offers Bond only a gun and a radio tracker. When this produces a raised eyebrow, he says: \"Were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go in&#xa0;for that any more.\" Thus frugally equipped, our hero confronts a world pervaded by guilt, doubt, grief and foreboding rather than the joshing sadism of his previous outings.</p> <p>The asperity of that world is no novelty for Craig's 007. In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/103963/casino.royale\" title=\"\">Casino Royale</a>, he suffered the humiliation of being tortured in the nude. Even more startlingly, he declared himself unambiguously in love. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122628/quantum.of.solace\" title=\"\">Quantum of Solace</a> provided him with the psychological driver for his behaviour that had previously been considered unnecessary.</p> <p>Still, James Bond is not the only screen hero to have sobered up. When his mirthfulness was at its height, it infected his big-screen beefcake peers. In the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/80204/total-recall\" title=\"\">1990 version</a> of Total Recall, Arnold Schwarzenegger tries to outdo Bond in homicidal gibes. Impaling an enemy on a drill, he remarks: \"Screw you!\" When his wife tells him he can't hurt her because they are married, he shoots her in the forehead and says: \"Consider that a divorce.\" This summer's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148835/total-recall\" title=\"\">reworking</a> of the story, on the other hand, was glumly earnest, offering social and political allusions in&#xa0;place of flippancy.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bfHsOPxSBE\" title=\"\">cheery Batman of 1966</a> has become <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jul/19/the-dark-knight-rises-review\" title=\"\">the grim and agonised Dark Knight</a>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> aspired to a portentousness of which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/75860/alien\" title=\"\">Alien</a> felt no need.

Bond was refashioned in 2005. That was also the year in which Christopher Nolan's glum Batman put in his first appearance, and The Thick of It arrived to show that screen entertainment could get serious without becoming humourless. However, in his 2005 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/mar/16/economy.uk\" title=\"\">budget speech</a>, then-chancellor Gordon Brown was still boasting that the economy had grown for 50 consecutive quarters and was forecast to carry on doing so. The darkening mood must therefore have deeper roots.</p> <p>Mark Batey, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.launchingfilms.com/\" title=\"\">Film Distributors' Association</a>, believes that in the days of Sean Connery's Bond, audiences still trusted in authority, whereas people generally seem less deferential now. \"Unarguably Chris Nolan was ahead of the game on this with films like Inception and the original Dark Knight.\"</p> <p>Claire Fox has other thoughts, and traces the current appetite for reflection back, with surprising specificity, to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The idea that the ideological conflict between capitalism and communism had reached an end led to a greater pragmatism, she argues, which in turn spread pessimism about our ability to reshape our world: \"Once you look round and think, 'Is this it?', it's a bit dispiriting.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the media's preoccupation with trivia began to irritate. All of these things came together to trigger a reaction, says Fox: \"I think there's a sense in which people start to think that this isn't satisfactory: it's too shallow.\"</p> <p>Beneath humanity's mood swings, a self-correcting pattern can be detected. The laughing cavaliers beget Cromwell's roundheads, who in turn beget the Restoration's libertines. Edwardian buoyancy morphs into Great War despair. This delivers the roaring 20s, which bring forth the despondent 30s. Frivolity, it can be conjectured, is intrinsically wearing and eventually boring: it produces a backlash of its own accord. By this reading, we should have been due for a period of pensiveness about now, even without the debacles that have beset us.</p> <p>Yet if we are really wising up, it is happening this time in the face of a legacy of unusually robust inanity. During the second half of the last century, the intellectual infrastructure that had sustained the importance of being earnest was hollowed out. The slow withdrawing roar of religious conviction and elite guidance brought forth a tidal wave of indifference.</p> <p>Relativism, postmodernism, solipsistic materialism and other anarchic creeds took on the force of dogma. Crises no less grave than our own were met with sneering, nihilism or facetious disregard. The smutty, smirking James Bonds of those days reflected the fervent vacuity of their era.</p> <p>When the joke wore off, it happened quite suddenly. In 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were commissioned to write a successor to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/93584/die.another.day\" title=\"\">Die Another Day</a>. \"They felt the film prior had become too fantastical. It was getting ridiculous,\" says Martin Campbell, the director of Casino Royale. According to Campbell, there were fears that the resulting change of tone would antagonise audiences. Yet Casino Royale took nearly $600m <a href=\"http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jamesbond21.htm\" title=\"\">at the box office</a>, the highest figure in the franchise's history. Clearly, the newly astringent Bond had struck some kind of chord.</p> <p>Skyfall looks poised to do even better, in our even gloomier climate. Yet although something in the air may have changed, the ground beneath it remains the same. Our new taste for gravity has not been matched by an overhaul of our intellectual outlook. So&#xa0;how serious is the new seriousness? Might it be just another frivolous fad, the latest <em>amuse-gueule</em> for irredeemably decadent palates?</p> <p>Films may have become darker, but&#xa0;they are not necessarily more intelligent. Few show the clear moral purpose that once used to infuse screen heroics. The Dark Knight's anguish did not develop into a coherent worldview. Inception did not&#xa0;actually <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/jul/20/inception-christopher-nolan-meaning\" title=\"\">make sense</a>.</p> <p>In Skyfall, director Sam Mendes toys,&#xa0;like Nolan, with grand issues. These range from the sacrifice of individuals for the greater good and the emotional consequences of childhood trauma, to the ethics of WikiLeaks and age discrimination in the workplace. But he only toys. Judi Dench's M has a grim-sounding message for the political class about \"the shadows\"; but it's not clear what, if anything, it means.</p> <p>In the real world too, our newfound seriousness has not cut very deep. The long-awaited crisis of capitalism has produced plenty of attitudinising, but profound discussion of how we might change our world has hardly been to the fore. There are those who see our apparent thirst for seriousness as no more than an illusion born of cultural fragmentation. Says Will Self: \"There are so many potential cultural sources that all levels of brow can be happily accommodated, including those that deceive themselves that they're higher than they really are.\"</p> <p>Even Claire Fox is unsure how much things have really changed. \"I don't want to be complacent,\" she says. \"These things can be fashionable. Often I go to book festivals and they just turn authors into celebrities.\"</p> <p>We may believe we like to be stirred; perhaps we just want to be shaken.</p>",
  "<p>The financial ombudsman is right when she says the banks have only themselves to blame now that the bill for PPI mis-selling has more than \u00a312bn.</p> <p>Bank executives complain loudly about ambulance-chasing lawyers and complaints-handling outfits that have exploited the situation to encourage thousands of spurious claims and cream off millions of pounds for themselves. Yet an ounce of honesty inside the banking system could have prevented costs escalating out of control.</p> <p>Instead they lobbied hard with the regulator and government against any crackdown on what was obviously a dodgy product. Victory secured, they carried on selling the insurance for several years longer than was prudent.</p> <p>They also, once the scandal was beyond dispute, insisted that the regulator force individuals to make a claim for compensation, much as they had when the endowment misselling scandal hit in the late 1990s.</p> <p>Believing it to be a clever ruse, the banks convinced themselves this strategy would avoid the huge costs of the personal pensions misselling scandal of the early 90s that saw them going through every file to determine how much each individual was out of pocket.</p> <p>There was much to gain from putting off the reckoning. Individuals such as Barclays boss Matt Barrett and Lloyds chief Peter Ellwood, who both earned huge bonuses on the back of PPI profits, should be answerable for knowingly duping the public into purchasing policies they would never be able to claim on. In the US they charge the sellers of such products with racketeering.</p> <p>Executives from all the major banks, as this paper revealed in 2004, met several times a year in Dublin, where they based their insurance arms to benefit from low taxes. The meetings were part of a conspiracy to protect what had become a golden goose for the industry. Public relations strategies were discussed and questions from the regulator answered by this secret cabal.</p> <p>The regulator refused to investigate until forced to by a super-complaint by Citizens Advice. Even now the regulator has ignored the conspiracy element of the story. A whistleblower talked to the Guardian. No one from the Financial Services Authority has shown any interest in talking to him. It has never asked who attended the meetings in Dublin or requested minutes of what happened. If the banks want to deny the meetings took place, fine \u2013 then the offshore operation was a sham, and they owe the exchequer millions in unpaid corporation tax.</p>",
  "<p>A veteran Northern Ireland prison officer whom republican dissident paramilitaries killed in a drive-by motorway shooting on Thursday was a member of the Protestant Orange Order, it has emerged.</p> <p>David Black's murder in front of early morning commuters between Lurgan and Portadown as he drove to work has raised fears of loyalist terrorists retaliating, given his links to the Orange and Protestant communities.</p> <p>The 52-year-old father of two, who had served in the prison service for nearly 30 years, had recently applied for voluntary redundancy, his union confirmed. His wife Yvonne called for no retaliations. \"Grief and sadness in another home will achieve nothing,\" she said.</p> <p>Black died at the scene from gunshot wounds after his black Audi car was raked with automatic fire at around 7.30am at the M12 turn-off of the M1. A blue Toyota Camry with a Dublin registration had driven up beside the victim's car while he was driving to work in Maghaberry top-security prison \u2013 a jail that is at the centre of violent republican protests.</p> <p>After Black was hit in the body several times, his car veered off the road and rolled into a drainage ditch, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. The car believed to have been used by his killers was later found burnt out nearby in the Inglewood area of Lurgan, County Armagh.</p> <p>The murder is thought to have been the work of a small group of republican veterans who are based in the Lurgan-Craigavon area, and who recently linked up with the new IRA. This group emerged during the summer and is an amalgam of disparate factions including the Real IRA, Republican Action Against Drugs and independent armed republican units in the east Tyrone area. This new alliance has been targeting prison officers in recent months, as well as other members of the security forces.</p> <p>Black's career included working at the Maze jail during the 1981 hunger strike. His last job involved him guarding 41 dissident republican prisoners belonging to the Continuity IRA and the new IRA factions in Maghaberry prison. Among the anti-ceasefire republicans held are three prisoners charged with gathering information on and targeting prison officers.</p> <p>Maghaberry has been the focal point of republican prisoner protests over strip-searching, with some inmates refusing to wash and in some cases throwing excrement from their cells into corridors.</p> <p>Black was from Cookstown in Co Tyrone and belonged to Montober Orange Lodge, the loyalist marching institution confirmed. The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland paid tribute to its colleague and said his only \"crime, like many of those before him, was to wear the uniform of his country, serving the community as a member of the security forces\".</p> <p>Edward Stevenson, the Grand Master of the Orange Order in Ireland, added that Black was the 337th member of the organisation murdered by republican paramilitaries since 1969.</p> <p>Martin McGuinness, the Sinn F\u00e9in deputy first minister of Northern Ireland and former IRA chief of staff during the Troubles, also denounced the killers.</p> <p>McGuinness challenged what he called the \"mouthpieces\" of dissident republicanism to come into the open and explain the rationale behind \"this pointless and futile killing\". His key partner in the Stormont power sharing government, Democratic Unionist Party leader Peter Robinson, described the killers as \"flat-earth deviants\".</p> <p>Expressing concern about the threat of further terror attacks on police officers and prison staff, Terry Spence, the chairman of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland, warned: \"Prison officers and police officers alike are aware of the deadly threat from dissident terrorists who won't face up to the fact that Northern Ireland has moved on and will not go back to its awful past. We must all be totally vigilant about our personal safety.\"</p> <p>His concerns were shared by the head of the Prison Officers' Association of Northern Ireland, Finlay Spratt, who claimed the government had put his members in the firing line by reducing their security. \"They have stripped away all the security around prison officers. They treat us now as if we live in normal society,\" he said.</p> <p>He added that he had known Black, describing him as \"a very nice fellow to work with. He always ensured he did his job to the letter. He was a very good officer.\"</p> <p>Northern Ireland's justice minister, David Ford, said that, while dissident republican groupings had little support, they had proved that they could still be dangerous. He confirmed that a number of prison officers had been moved out of their homes after the PSNI received intelligence reports that groups like the Continuity IRA and the new IRA were targeting them for assassination.</p> <p>The British and Irish governments joined local politicians in condemning the motorway murder. David Cameron said: \"These killers will not succeed in denying the people of Northern Ireland the peaceful, shared future they so desperately want.\"</p> <p>The killing is likely to be top of the agenda when ministers from Dublin and Belfast meet at the 15th North-South Ministerial Council in Northern Ireland .</p> <p>Sue McAllister, the recently appointed head of the prison service in the province, said it had been a \"very sad\" day for all those who had served with Black. She said she intended to meet Black's widow, Yvonne, his son, Kyle, and daughter, Kyra.</p>",
  "<p>\"I'd love to say I had a genius plan but the whole thing was a fluke,\" says Timfy James, guitarist and founder member of the band Hacktivist. Ostensibly exponents of <a href=\"http://got-djent.com/\" title=\"\">djent</a> \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/03/djent-metal-geeks\" title=\"\">complex, technically formidable form of heavy music</a> \u2013 the young five-piece from the Milton Keynes suburb of Wolverton combine thunderous riffs and quick-fire grime rhyming in a fashion poised to take this obscure scene overground. But as James tells it, their genre cross-pollination came about almost by accident.</p> <p>\"I was recording some grime stuff with my friend J Hurley, who's been an MC for years,\" James<strong> </strong>says, looking every inch the surly hardcore archetype with his asymmetrical haircut and box-fresh skate gear. \"One day I was tinkering around with this metal track and he really liked it and asked if he could try some lyrics on it. I just thought: 'Why not?' We put it up on Soundcloud and it just took off from there. The rest of it is a blur.

They have a frontman who comes from the grime scene and knows nothing about the metal scene at all. It all seems very real&#xa0;as a result and it's not contrived.

Thanks to an extraordinary level of international support that has evolved almost entirely online, djent has been growing steadily for several years away from the mainstream. Visit the forums on websites such as <a href=\"http://got-djent.com/\" title=\"\">got-djent.com</a> and witness fans from Europe, the US and Australia expressing their fanatical support for the genre. In fact, there are obvious parallels with the dubstep scene. Djent is created primarily by suburban nerds with laptops using state-of-the-art music software that is then used to power and control live&#xa0;performances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/255364/vidId=1495075&amp;la=n\"> <object width=\"640\" height=\"366\" id=\"muzuplayer-255364\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/255364/vidId=1495075&la=n\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/255364/vidId=1495075&la=n\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" wmode=\"transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"283\" name=\"muzuplayer-255364\"></embed></object><br /><a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/periphery-emi/make-total-destroy-music-video/1495075/\">Periphery - Make Total Destroy</a> on <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/\">MUZU.TV</a>. </figure>  <p>Reading this on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/periphery-emi/make-total-destroy-music-video/1495075/#\">Click here to view</a><br>\"Djent is definitely metal but if you listen to dubstep, our music is around the same tempo, with the same syncopated rhythms,\" says James, who at 24 speaks with the assurance of a veteran. \"I love dubstep, hip-hop and drum'n'bass and I use a lot of that ambience in our stuff. We're uniting a lot of people. People have said, 'I've never listened to metal before but you make it speak to me,' and others have said, 'I really hate hip-hop but I love what you're doing.' That's really&#xa0;exciting.\"</p> <p>The creation of djent is usual attributed to maverick Swedish metal band <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/cf8b3b8c-118e-4136-8d1d-c37091173413\" title=\"\">Meshuggah</a>, who established their blend of bewildering polyrhythms and intricate riffs in the early 90s and continue to confound conservative fans of heavy music today. But this new generation is taking that blueprint and gleefully mixing it up with anything that strays on to their radar, regardless of how it might polarise&#xa0;opinion.</p> <p>\"There are people from the dance arena who see Hacktivist as something with similar crossover potential to something like the Prodigy,\" says Phillips, exuding fatherly pride for the scene his label has nurtured. \"They're pricking up ears outside of the metal world and that speaks volumes.\"</p> <p>Several labels are currently buzzing around Hacktivist, sensing that something remarkable is happening. It certainly helps that the band's live performances have more in common with a low-key grime or hip-hop gig than a bright and blustery metal show. Shrouded in darkness and dressed in hoodies or black skate wear, the quintet exude an air of menace that fits perfectly with their gritty, urban sound. Frankly, you wouldn't mess with them even before the monstrous riffs and ultra-precise beats kick in. Hurley's lyrics combine braggadocio and rebellious sloganeering with an underlying sense of bleak urban unease. \"Volcanoes erupt from beneath,\" he barks on Cold Shoulders, \"as we stand here gritting our teeth \u2026\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F62297220&amp;show_artwork=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F62297220&show_artwork=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>With a self-titled debut EP released on 12 November to coincide with <a href=\"http://www.songkick.com/artists/5691769-hacktivist\" title=\"\">a first headlining tour of the UK</a>, the band are eager to maintain their independence. But it's not hard to imagine a future where this forward-thinking music gatecrashes the mainstream.</p> <p>\"Djent is evolved music,\" says John Browne, guitarist with Monuments. \"If you listen to the pop charts you just hear Michael Jackson over and over again. But with this, it's not a blatant copy of anything. It's taking elements of great things and making them into something that's new and hopefully great, too. It's just the evolution of more complex music and it really seems to connect with people.\"</p> <p>\"This scene proves that people can do what the hell they want and reach the other side of the planet without big labels interfering,\" James says. \"People are doing it on their own. It's&#xa0;just a new way of making music. I can make up a band name, put some songs up on Soundcloud and YouTube, and if it's got the right spark it'll go global.\"</p>",

After dropping to 7.8% last month, any rise could dominate the final days of the campaign, tilting what remains of the tiny group of undecided voters towards Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Romney, who resumed campaigning day earlier, made the economy and unemployment a big part of his final pitch. \"If the president were to be re-elected, we're going to see high levels of unemployment continue,\" he said.</p> <p>An Obama spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, asked about the figures yesterday, said: \"Regardless what they are, the president is going to feel there's more we need to do to help people get back to work.\"</p> <p>The Obama team is hoping that any poor unemployment figures will be more than compensated for by the plaudits Obama has won this week for his handling of Sandy.</p> <p>The president, looking more confident and with more vigour than he has throughout most of the campaign, told a small crowd gathered near the steps of Air Force One at an airport in Green Bay that America had been inspired by what it had witnessed this week.</p> <p>\"All the petty differences that consume us in normal times all seem to melt away. There are no Democrats or Republicans during a storm, there are just fellow Americans,\" the president said.</p> <p>The line is a reprise of the plea for bipartisan cooperation that saw him rise to national prominence after a speech to the Democratic convention in 2004 and that he used repeatedly in the 2008 campaign.</p> <p>\"Leaders of different parties working to fix what's broken. neighbours helping neighbours cope with tragedy; communities rallying to rebuild; a spirit that says, in the end, we're all in this together -\u2013 that we rise or fall as one nation, as one people.\"</p> <p>Both the Obama and Romney campaigns claim they are winning. National polls show the two tied but of 11 polls published yesterday/Thurs in the eight swing states that will decide the election Obama is ahead in eight, Romney in two and the other a dead heat.</p> <p>The election could hinge on Ohio, a volatile and unpredictable state in which Obama holds a small lead, up two points in the Real Clear Politics average of polls.</p> <p>The Republican challenger enjoyed a surge in support after his success against Obama in the first of the presidential debates on October 3, regularly attracting crowds of 10,000 or more, but in the aftermath of Sandy these have dropped away. The crowd at his first event in Virginia yesterday attracted fewer than 3,000.</p> <p>Some Republicans are rehearsing excuses if they lose, such as blaming Sandy.</p> <p>The former Republican governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour, emailed Politico to say: \"One thing is obvious \u2013 for a period of three days or more, nobody on the news media was reporting anything about the economy or job, spending, deficits or debts. And that's the Obama campaign's dream.\"</p> <p>In Green Bay, Obama shifted quickly from talking about Sandy to making his closing argument, a reprise of the stump speech he had been giving before Sandy.</p> <p>He described Romney as \"using all his talents as a salesman\" in trying to sell the same policies of George W Bush that had created the economic mess and that he would rubberstamp Tea Party policies.</p> <p>Obama's bipartisanship message is aimed not just at independents but Congress, hoping that a victory for him might persuade Republicans who control the House to cooperate in working out a deal in the face of an impending economic crisis.</p> <p>Although the White House is careful to avoid any accusations of complacency, work is underway on post-election priorities. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, briefing reporters, refused to discuss specifics beyond saying that the administration is always working on budget issues. The big problem looming is a face-off with Congress over tackling the 'fiscal cliff', major spending cuts to reduce the burgeoning deficit.</p> <p>\"The president has said and believes that after the election we will be able to come together in a bipartisan way to resolve these issues and to deal with our deficit and debt challenge with a balanced proposal that reflects an overwhelming consensus among experts and the American people about how we should get this done. And he looks forward to tackling those issues after the election,\" Carney said.</p> <p>Romney, in his first speech of the day in Virginia, stuck too to his stump speech, reprising an anecdotes about Boy Scouts, the song America the Beautiful and lines from a fictional football team in the show Friday Night Lights in which there was a rallying cry on the way out of the locker room: \"clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose\".

Some of those goals in some countries are expected to be achieved by the 2015 deadline; others definitely will not.</p> <p>This week's meetings \u2013 the first substantive discussions on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/31/post-2015-development-agenda-explained\" title=\"\">post-2015 development agenda</a> \u2013 focused on household poverty, both defining it and looking at ways to get households out of poverty. Describing this week's sessions as lively, constructive and productive, Cameron cited the importance of rights for women, a free press, the rule of law, an open society and an open economy \u2013 a combination amounting to what he described as the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204712904578090571423009066.html\" title=\"\">\"golden thread\" of development</a>.</p> <p>Cameron and his co-chairs, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the president of Indonesia, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/nov/02/liberia-johnson-sirleaf-women-politics-video\">Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</a> (video), all emphasised the importance of listening to civil society, the private sector and young people, in an attempt to achieve the widest possible consensus for the follow-up to the MDGs.</p> <p>\"The goals we come up with are not handed down from rich to poor countries \u2026 they are not tablets of stone handed by the UN. We all have responsibilities,\" said the prime minister at a joint press conference with his co-chairs at Downing Street.</p> <p>Yudhoyono emphasised the importance of \"sustainable growth with equity\" amid a growing awareness among policy makers and development experts that economic growth alone is no guarantor of wellbeing and stability.</p> <p>\"We need to ensure that growth will be shared equally,\" he said.</p> <p>Johnson Sirleaf, speaking for a state slowly recovering after decades of bloody conflict, stressed the fundamental importance of peace and security to reduce the fragility and vulnerability of states. She said Africa \u2013 the new frontier \u2013 stood to gain much from a new development agenda.</p> <p>\"The global economic pie has the best opportunity to be widened,\" she said, with Africa benefiting from a bigger pie.</p> <p>With only 15 minutes, the three did not delve into any detail on what a post-2015 agenda would look like. The task of writing up a report by May will fall to 26 experts, with inequality expected to be a strong theme.</p> <p>A Save the Children report published on Wednesday said the gap between rich and poor is at its highest since the 1990s and is growing, with children hit hardest.</p> <p>Born Equal said in some countries, the gulf between the richest and poorest families has <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/news-and-comment/news/2012-10/gap-between-rich-and-poorest-widest-nineties\" title=\"\">increased by up to 179% over the past two decades</a>. Moreover, the gap between rich and poor children has grown by 35% and in some countries more than twice the numbers of poor children die before the age of five than rich children.</p> <p>The charity calculated the household income per child in the top and bottom 10% of income scales in 32 countries.</p> <p>\"Unless inequality is addressed,\" said Justin Forsyth, Save the Children's chief executive. \"The MDGs and any future development framework will simply not succeed in maintaining or accelerating progress. What's more, it will hold individual countries \u2013 and the world \u2013 back from experiencing real growth and prosperity.\"</p> <p>The UN says a post-2015 framework will have at its core the continuing fight against poverty, climate change and sustainable development, while addressing inclusive growth, equality, peace and security, and human rights.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government says an independent Scotland would have to apply as a new member state to join the European Union, with uncertain consequences.</p> <p>In a brief statement issued on Thursday, Westminster hinted strongly that its legal advice directly contradicted the claim by Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, that, if Scotland voted for independence, it and the rest of the UK would need to reapply to join the EU as newly formed states.</p> <p>As the controversy over Salmond's stance on Europe again dominated first minister's questions at Holyrood, the UK government said its position was that only Scotland would have to apply to join as a new state if voters chose independence in 2014.</p> <p>Separately, in a speech on Europe to the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House in London, the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg entered the fray, stating that Salmond's statements on Scotland getting automatic membership of the EU \"has no basis in fact\".</p> <p>He said Scottish nationalists \"don't want to face what might happen to Scotland's influence on fishing quotas, or agricultural policy, or the regulation of the banks. They don't want reality to bite. So they've gone into denial, preferring political assertion to legal advice.\"</p> <p>The dispute has suddenly dominated the debate about the Scottish independence referendum after Salmond's deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, revealed last week that the Scottish National party government had not sought its own legal advice on EU membership, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/alex-salmond-eu-legal-advice-scotland\" title=\"\">despite statements by Salmond that it had. </a></p> <p>The UK government statement stressed that, unlike the Scottish government, it had obtained formal advice from its law officers and that Scotland would have to negotiate the terms of its EU membership with the UK and all other 26 member states.</p> <p>It said: \"This government has confirmed it does hold legal advice on this issue. Based on the overwhelming weight of international precedent, it is the government's view that the remainder of the UK would continue to exercise the UK's existing international rights and obligations and Scotland would form a new state.</p> <p>\"The most likely scenario is that the rest of the UK would be recognised as the continuing state and an independent Scotland would have to apply to join the EU as a new state, involving negotiation with the rest of the UK and other member states, the outcome of which cannot be predicted.\"</p> <p>Referring to statements by European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and his deputy, Viviane Reding, that a newly independent country would be seen as a new applicant, it added: \"Recent pronouncements from the commission support that view.\"</p> <p>It rejected Salmond's suggestion that the UK should take up the commission's offer to provide any member state with a clear view on the membership rights of a newly-formed state within the EU.</p> <p>The commission has recently said that after the deal between Salmond and David Cameron to stage the independence referendum, known as the Edinburgh agreement, it could offer its opinion if a member state provided a detailed and specific scenario.</p> <p>Officials said Salmond had not actually officially asked the UK government to do so, and added that it was the Scottish government's problem, not the UK's.</p> <p>\"The UK government does not obtain its legal advice from the European commission,\" the statement from Westminster said. \"We are clear that we are not pre-negotiating the terms of separation from the UK ahead of the referendum. It is the Scottish government's policy on independence which is causing this uncertainty and they should be prepared to deal with the many questions it raises.\"</p> <p>Salmond was goaded during first minister's questions about the controversy that erupted last week and escalated further after Spain's foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo, said an independent Scotland would have to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/24/scotland-eu-membership-spain\" title=\"\"> \"join the queue\" for EU membership. </a></p> <p>Johann Lamont, the Scottish Labour leader, said the first minister was \"treating the people of Scotland like fools\" and was no longer trusted to tell the truth. \"What is it that he's so scared of, that he can't ask the Bank of England about the pound; he can't ask other EU members about Europe?\" she asked.</p> <p>Salmond retaliated by quoting from an expert on the EU's borders, Graham Avery, a former strategy director at the commission who was made one of a number of honorary directors general of the European commission after he retired.</p> <p>In a submission to the Commons foreign affairs select committee, Avery supported Salmond's position that it was inconceivable that an independent Scotland would be expected to leave the EU and then reapply. Salmond said his opinion \"rather puts the lie to the scaremongering campaign of Labour and their unionist colleagues in the Conservative party\".</p> <p>\"For practical and political reasons, they could not be asked to leave the EU and apply for readmission,\" Avery told the committee. \"Negotiations on the terms of membership would take place in the period between the referendum and the planned date of independence. The EU would adopt a simplified procedure for the negotiations, not the traditional procedure followed for the accession of non-member countries.\"</p> <p>But Avery, now at St Antony's College, Oxford University, directly contradicted Salmond's assertions that an independent Scotland would not be expected to join the euro instead of sterling, and that it would not need to sign up to the Schengen agreement rules on security and immigration.</p> <p>Avery said independence would give Scotland a louder and stronger voice in the EU, but new member states \"are required to accept [the euro and Schengen] on principle\". While Scotland's position was still not clear, Avery warned: \"In accession negotiations with non-member countries, the EU has always strongly resisted other changes or opt-outs from the basic treaties.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2012.

  "<p>In early summer, Abu Ismael, a six-year veteran of al-Qaida, left the insurgency still blazing in his homeland of Iraq and travelled to what he believes is the start of the apocalypse.</p> <p>He secured cash from a benefactor in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil, then approached a weapons dealer in Anbar province, a desolate corner of the country that was not long ago a staging point for jihadis arriving from Syria and is now a gateway for those going the other way.</p> <p>\"It was easy,\" he said, in the sitting room of a house in the Syrian city of Aleppo. \"The money was no problem, neither was the weapon, or the motivation. This will be a fight against the great enemy.\"</p> <p>Around the hard-bitten 23-year-old sat three members of a Syrian rebel militia who were acting as his hosts. They looked at the floor as the young jihadi explained Qur'anic teachings that he said were shaping the battle ahead. \"I don't care about the future,\" he said. \"I care about today. Muhammad the Messenger said there would be a battle between the Persians and the Sunnis. And it is coming.</p> <p>\"When the regime falls, all those who fought against the Muslims will be my enemy, especially the Shias,\" he said, reiterating a view held by some Sunni extremists that Shia are their biggest foes.</p> <p>The hosts shifted nervously, still avoiding eye contact. The stranger in their midst had sought refuge among them two months ago. Since then he had rented a house, won a ride to the battle zone whenever he wants and earned the support of some of the area's rebel units.</p> <p>He has even won a more coveted prize: the right to marry the daughter of one of the fighter's cousins, a union that took place on Thursday with the qualified blessing of residents and clerics.</p> <p>Not everyone in the unit was happy with the wedding. \"It's you scratch my back, I scratch yours,\" said one young rebel, Abu Saif. \"He's a Salafi, there is no doubt about that,\" he added, referring to the ultra-fundamentalist school of Qur'anic thinking. \"And he doesn't represent what we believe.\"</p> <p>Remonstrating with the unnamed young girl's uncle sitting nearby, Abu Saif said: \"You tell me what benefit we get from him, or that your family gets.\" The uncle shrugged, offering no reply.</p> <p>As Syria's civil war grinds inexorably on, it is becoming as much a clash of ideologies as a battle of military will. The frontlines that were hurriedly carved out of Aleppo's ancient stone heart and concrete suburbs during the heady days of summer now seem almost secondary in the contest to determine the type of society that will one day rise from the ruins.</p> <p>For the most part, the opposition movement is staying true to the ethos that led many of the country's towns and citizens to mount a challenge to President Bashar al-Assad's absolute state control over their lives. But around the fringes, there are signs that the revolution's original values are starting to fray. The narrative of a defiant street versus a draconian state, so simple in March 2011, is now far more complicated.</p> <p>\"We want just what they got in Tunis and Egypt,\" said Mahmoud Razak, a shop-keeper in the outer suburbs. \"Freedom and the chance to progress in life. But we thought it would take 19 days like it took [in Egypt]. It's now 19 months. We didn't know it would be this difficult.\"</p> <p>To those now hosting Abu Ismael, the Iraqi jihadi embodies one of the major problems. Though for the most part conservative and pious, the men of this part of Aleppo refuse to see the crisis now consuming Syria in existential terms. To them, this is still a fight for self-determination, not the forum for an apocalyptic showdown with a preordained foe.</p> <p>\"What is this global jihad that he talks about?\" asked a town elder, Abu Abdullah, after the Iraqi had left to prepare for his wedding. \"We will be used as toys by them, just as the Sunni communities were in Iraq. When they have had their way with us they will demand that we return to the seventh century under the blade of a sword.\"</p> <p>Abu Ismael made no secret of his wish for Syria to be the heartland of an al-Qaida-led renaissance. Nor, unusually, did he hide what he had done in Iraq, or what he planned to do in the new war. In a candid hour-long discussion, he offered a rare insight into the terror group's designs on Syria and the organisation's fraught battle to assert itself. \"I was a member of the al-Qaida organisation from 2005-11,\" he said, his black eyes set in an unflinching stare. \"I joined them with my father when I was 16 and apart from one and a half months in prison, I was very active in every way.\"</p> <p>The young Iraqi's attire and demeanour were unmistakably those of a Salafi. He refused cigarettes, cuffed the bottoms of his fatigues at ankle level and wore a black skull cap over closely cropped black hair. More instructively, he spoke with derision about Shia Muslims, whom he said were increasingly travelling to Syria to fight the Sunni-led opposition.</p> <p>\"They are saying they are going to protect the Sit Zeinab mosque in Damascus,\" he said of a shrine revered by Shias. \"The Jaish al-Mahdi [Mahdi army] and Hezbollah are just using that as cover to enter the rest of Syria. We will not let them. We will attack it, perhaps not to destroy it, but to drive them out.</p> <p>\"There are around 50 Iraqis in each area of northern Syria. Perhaps more. It was not difficult to get here and it is not hard to find other mujahideen. We can fight where we want to and when we want to. And God willing we will prevail.\"</p> <p>His restless hosts were not so sure. Bound by social customs that offer wayfarers shelter and hospitality, this rebel unit seemed to sense that trouble is brewing between them and the growing band of global jihadis. Many rebel groups the Guardian spoke to this week said a showdown was looming with the new arrivals.</p> <p>\"I give it six months,\" said one rebel officer at a checkpoint in the old market place in the central Aleppo suburb of Midan on Thursday. \"Maybe a year,\" said another. \"I was in Iraq fighting the Americans and I saw how they changed once they sensed they had power.\"</p> <p>\"It's so mixed up,\" said a third young rebel, a defector from Damascus. \"And this is just how Bashar wants it.\"</p> <h2>Rise of the Salafis</h2> <p>Bashar al-Assad has insisted from the start that Syria was facing attack by \"armed terrorist gangs\", not a popular uprising \u2013 though there is ample evidence of the army firing on mostly unarmed demonstrators. But it has become clear that extremist Salafi or jihadi groups, some linked to al-Qaida, are now a significant element of the armed opposition.</p> <p>Alongside fighters from al-Qaida in Iraq or Fatah al-Islam from Lebanon is the mysterious Jabhat al-Nusra, which has claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Damascus and Aleppo. It is sympathetic to al-Qaida. Others hail from Jordan, Libya and Algeria.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority of jihadis are Syrian, with the number of foreigners ranging from 1,200 to 1,500 members. Jihadi groups in Syria represent less than 10% of all fighters. Still, many have combat experience in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Libya and compete for funds and weapons with the Free Syrian Army, the main armed opposition group.</p> <p>\"Most foreign fighters go abroad to defend their fellow Muslim brethren from being slaughtered,\" according to Aaron Y Zelin, an analyst at the Washington Institute.</p> <p>\"Once in the area of battle, though, many come into closer contact with hardline jihadis, as well as fighters from other countries, and are exposed to new ideas.</p> <p>\"Therefore, portions of foreign fighters are not fighting to help establish a future state for Syrian nationals. Rather, they hope to annex it to be part of their grander aims of establishing emirates that will eventually lead to a re-established caliphate \u2013 however fanciful this project might be.\" <strong>Ian Black</strong></p>",
  "<p>A retired British businessman has formally pleaded guilty in a Texas court to selling batteries for Iranian surface-to-air missiles following a plea bargain with prosecutors.</p> <p>Christopher Tappin, 66, from Orpington, Kent, was extradited from the UK in February to face trial in the US. He had previously denied the charges, claiming he was the victim of an FBI sting operation.</p> <p>Opponents of UK to US extradition arrangements say threats of exceptionally long prison sentences in the US often result in suspects opting to cut a deal with prosecutors. Tappin's UK solicitor, Karen Todner, said 98% of people who enter the US justice system agree a plea deal.</p> <p>\"The odds are so heavily stacked against a defendant who chooses to plead not guilty and is found guilty that the vast majority of people facing trial in the US opt to take a plea agreement,\" she said.</p> <p>Tappin, a freight expert and golf enthusiast, appeared in court in El Paso. He is not expected to be sentenced until 9 January. His guilty plea, to one count of the indictment, calls for a 33-month jail term. Prosecutors will not oppose him serving this in the UK. He could have faced 35 years in prison under the original charges.</p> <p>His wife, Elaine, 62, is suffering from chronic Churg-Strauss syndrome, a blood circulation disorder, and being cared for by their daughter at home. She said : \"My overwhelming feeling remains one of anxiety and sadness. However at last I dare hope that Chris will be back on home soil next year. I feel we are getting to the beginning of the end.It has been a very difficult time for us all and one that would have been infinitely harder had we not received such warm support from friends and strangers alike. For that I shall always remain extremely grateful.\"</p> <p>Last night the US department of justice welcomed the changed plea.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"In court today, Tappin admitted that from December 2005 to January 2007, he knowingly aided and abetted others, including his Cyprus-based business associate Robert Frederick Gibson, age 57, and 62-year-old Robert Caldwell of Portland, Oregon, in an illegal attempt to export zinc/silver oxide Reserve Batteries to Iran. These particular batteries, a special component of the Hawk Air Defense Missile, are designated as a defense article on the US Munitions List and require a license or written authorization from the U.S. State Department for export from the United States.</p> <p>\"Using false shipping documentation, Tappin arranged for the transfer of the batteries to the United Kingdom without an export license through his specifically designated freight forwarders in violation of export control regulations. During the investigation, Tappin even agreed to reimburse the undercover agent for $5,000 in fines purportedly being assessed against him by U.S. Customs authorities after they had seized the shipment of batteries.\"Tappin, a former president of the Kent Golf Union, was initially detained in a US jail, Otero county prison, and endured solitary confinement, where lights were kept on 24 hours a day.</p> <p>He was granted bail and stayed with his US lawyer before moving into a flat in Houston. He is restricted by an ankle bracelet and GPS tracking device, but is free to play golf, and use the gym and pool, providing he sticks to his curfew and stays in the local area.</p> <p>He told the Sunday Telegraph: \"It's a very nice area with some lovely people, but you pay a heavy price for life in a paradise. Without the golf, I'd go raving mad. It keeps me from thinking too much about the case, but it's tough, it's very tough.</p> <p>\"I'm playing well and happy to get my game back after two months in jail. But these are hardly the circumstances in which I'd want to sharpen my game.\"</p> <p>The case followed an investigation that began in 2005 when US agents asked technology providers about apparently suspicious purchasers. Those customers were then approached by undercover companies set up by government agencies.</p> <p>Robert Gibson, a British associate of Tappin who agreed to co-operate, was jailed for 24 months after pleading guilty in 2007 to conspiracy to export defence articles. He gave agents 16,000 computer files and emails indicating that he and Tappin had long-standing commercial ties with Iranian customers. An American, Robert Caldwell, was found guilty of aiding and abetting the illegal transport of defence articles and served 20 months in prison.</p> <p>Tappin's predicament is one that other extradited Britons have faced. David Bermingham, one of three bankers jailed for 37 months over an Enron-related fraud in a deal with US prosecutors in 2008, said no sane defendant would risk dozens of years in jail when a plea bargain could enable them to be home within months. \"A prosecutor can now effectively be judge, jury and executioner,\" he said. \"He can say, 'I'm going to charge you with 98 different counts, each carrying a five- or 10-year maximum sentence, and potentially you could be sentenced to literally the rest of your life in prison.' And there's no parole. There's no two ways about it.</p> <p>\"However if you plead guilty, 30 years becomes five years. If you are then co-operating and willing to give evidence against others, five years becomes two.\"</p>",
  "<p>Most flights to the USA have now resumed, and travellers from the UK due to visit the east coast in the next few days are unlikely to find their journey affected, but should still contact their airline to check the situation beforehand, and not travel to the airport without a confirmed booking.</p> <p>Some flights were still experiencing operational delays as crew or aircraft were not in the right place, and there was a backlog of passengers hoping to travel. Virgin and British Airways flights to New York are now going ahead as normal, although American Airlines said its flights to a number of airports, including Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, were still being affected by backlogs and high winds.</p> <p>John Grant of OAG (<a href=\"http://www.oagaviation.com/\" title=\"\">oagaviation.com</a>), which provides airline schedule data to airlines and airports around the world, said a small percentage of flights to a number of east coast airports were still being disrupted, including New York (especially Newark, where 25% of all inbound flights were cancelled), Washington and Pittsburg, as well as Toronto. Philadelphia airport was open again but passengers should still check with their airline.</p> <p>Grant said that, as of Wednesday night, 19,200 flights had been affected by Sandy, inconveniencing 1.8 million passengers, and costing the top six airlines to the USA (including Jet Blue, Delta and United), $19m per day.</p> <p>But the storm has affected aviation much less than the ash cloud from the Icelandic volcano in 2010, which disrupted over 100,000 flights, inconveniencing seven million passengers, and cost the same six airlines $257 million per day.Passengers whose flights are due to depart, but who feel they do not want to fly because of the situation on the ground, will not be covered by travel insurance if they want to cancel, and airlines are under no obligation to offer a refund, alternative date or destination. However, even though its flights to New York are now going ahead, <a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com/travel/flightops/public/en_gb?p_faqid=4501\" title=\"\">British Airways</a> was offering passengers due to travel up to and including the 7 November, the flexibility to change their travel plans and rebook up to and including 30 November.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.americanairlines.co.uk/pubcontent/en_GB/notifications/notificationTemplates/tmp10-travelPolicy-english-hurricane.jsp\" title=\"\">American Airlines</a> was letting those due to travel to or through all three New York airports up until 7 November rearrange flights to travel before 20 December.

If they can fly out but are unable to stay in their booked accommodation then the tour operator must offer a reasonable alternative, which must be comparable to the booked accommodation (such as the same resort and the same price level). If the tour operator is unable to provide this then they will offer a refund.\" However some tour operators were still letting travellers change their arrangements, on a case by case basis, last week. </p> <p>Abta has information at <a href=\"http://www.abta.com/consumer-services/travel_information/travel_disruption\" title=\"\">abta.com/consumer-services/travel_information/travel_disruption</a>.</p> <p>Tour America Direct has been rescheduling travel for customers due to travel this week, offering refunds, alternative dates or different routes. \"We had someone on a New York and Orlando trip and they're simply reversing their itinerary,\" said marketing manager Veronica Aherne, \"but we expect things to be back on course very soon.\"</p> <p>Virgin Holidays said the majority of its customers are travelling as planned, but that \"anyone due to travel on a package in the next few days whose hotel has been closed for safety reasons is being offered alternatives, the chance to rebook to a different date, or to cancel with a full refund.\"</p> <p>Sandy hit Canada after the US, where the east coast has been affected by rain, strong winds and power cuts, and their were flight cancellations last week, but the Canadian Tourism Commission said it was not aware of any ongoing impact on British travellers, and that it had no reports of flights between the UK to Canada being affected, but travellers should check with their airline.</p> <p>The main concern now for holidaymakers is what they will find when they arrive, but US tourist boards and tour companies reassured travellers that most holidays could continue as planned, and their visits are greatly appreciated by their hosts.</p> <p>New York is quickly returning to normal, with all airports open, as well as most museums, shops and attractions in Manhattan, though some public transport is still affected and there is traffic congestion and powercuts downtown. The city's tourist board said the best place for up to date information on what's open, including events, attractions and restaurants is <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/nycgo\" title=\"\">facebook.com/nyc</a>. Sunday's New York <a href=\"http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/\" title=\"\">marathon</a> will ahead.</p> <p>Washington's hospitality industry was \"open for business and ready to welcome visitors\" said the capital region's tourist board. Roads, public transport, museums, tours, hotels and attractions are operating as usual. Amtrak was still assessing its schedule for the north-east corridor, so those due to travel by train should check with their holiday company. Virginia and Maryland experienced no major incidents or damage, apart from heavy snow in western Maryland.</p> <p>Flights to the Caribbean are all going ahead now, though the tourism industry is worrying about the effects on visitor numbers, particularly as a large number of visitors are from east coast America. The Jamaican Hotel and Tourist Association said 550,205 visitors came from that area last year, and it expected a drop in numbers for this winter period. Some hotels were offering discounts to encourage travellers, it said.</p> <p>Sandy isn't the only wildly disruptive weather phenomenon at the moment.

  "<p>The radical Islamist group Boko Haram is willing to enter peace talks with Nigeria's government if they are held in Saudi Arabia and spearheaded by a former military ruler, an alleged member of the sect has said.</p> <p>\"We are not actually challenging the state, as people are saying, but the security [forces] who are killing our members, children and wives. If this government is sincere, [attacks] will come to an end,\" Abu Mohammed Ibn Abdulaziz said in the city of Maidugiri, the northern stronghold of Boko Haram. He said Muhamed Buhari, a Muslim colonel who ruled Nigeria for 20 months after seizing power in 1984, had to be a negotiator during talks.</p> <p>It is the first contact by Boko Haram since Nigerian security forces said they had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/nigerian-police-boko-haram-spokesman\" title=\"\">killed its spokesperson</a>, known by the alias Abu Qaqa, in September. Outside understanding of the myriad factions thought to operate under the Boko Haram banner has hinged on intermediaries who represent the leader, Abubakar Shekau. Abdulaziz said he represented Shekau, though unusually he spoke entirely in English.</p> <p>A senior security source said the demands were being considered as potentially genuine. \"The fact of asking Buhari to be involved is telling. Like the average northerner, the bulk of Boko Haram members believe Buhari is a stalwart Muslim who will not be swayed into betrayal by politics,\" the source said.</p> <p>Boko Haram began as a largely peaceful movement in the north-east of Nigeria before it radicalised and began demanding the nationwide application of strict sharia law. By the time it had struck the UN headquarters in the capital, Abuja, last August, outside help and training was coming from al-Qaida-affiliated groups in Afghanistan and Algeria, security sources say.</p> <p>The militant group's most powerful and active branch was initially headquartered in Saudi Arabia. Members of the group have met senior al-Qaida figures during visits to Saudia Arabia, Qaqa claimed in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/27/boko-haram-nigeria-sharia-law\" title=\"\">interview with the Guardian</a> this year.</p> <p>Previous attempts to hold peace talks have collapsed, but insiders say efforts towards reaching the group have improved since President Goodluck Jonathan replaced his top security adviser with a colonel from the Muslim north.</p>",
  "<p>The government's perma-shambles continues. Almost everything goes wrong. A new chief whip was greeted on Wednesday night with a crushing defeat after 53 Tories voted with Labour over Europe, ignoring their prime minister. And the minister for energy, a Conservative, is now completely at odds with the energy secretary, who is a Liberal Democrat.</p> <p>Clearly the secretary of state, Ed Davey, should be in charge. He told us that he was in charge. The minister of state, John Hayes, nominally his understrapper, had said there would be no more windfarms blighting our landscape. \"Enough is enough,\" was how he put it.</p> <p>Mr Davey believes there can never be enough windfarms. Only when, say, the entire Lake District is covered with the things, generating at peak periods enough electricity to power several toasters in the Penrith area, will he and the other Lib Dems be satisfied. I exaggerate, but not a great deal.</p> <p>For someone who had allegedly been given a bollocking by the boss, Mr Hayes looked remarkably pleased with himself. He resembled the schoolboy who, having been summoned to the headmaster for a caning, has remembered to wear his cast-iron Y-fronts.</p> <p>He had an air of casual insouciance, or as he put it \"What a pleasure it is to answer energy questions for the first time, and to do so with the wind in my sails.\" One of his joys is making life difficult for the Tories' coalition partners. Simon Hughes said the coalition agreement meant there could be no public subsidy for nuclear power. Mr Hayes was far too happy about the offer from Hitachi to provide us with nuclear power to let that one go. \"Let me be crystal clear,\" he said, using the politicians' term for \"let me obfuscate\". There would be no subsidy, \"unless similar support is provided more widely for other forms of generation\".</p> <p>In other words, the Tories were perfectly prepared to rip up the agreement. As they always are, when they can get away with it. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, complained. Mr Hayes said he would not be influenced by \"the preoccupations of bourgeois-left academics\". Who, presumably, are the only people concerned with the fate of the planet, in their horrible Marxist, middle-class, tree-hugging, beard-growing, Monbiot-reading way.</p> <p>Later, Mr Davey said he would be quite happy to listen to the views of bourgeois-left academics. Another coalition split! Mr Hayes was, by now, out of control. He praised himself for his clarity. He slapped himself on the back for the speed with which he acts.</p> <p>Mr Davey had the air of a man who couldn't take much more of this. Labour's Caroline Flint wanted to know if he and Mr Hayes were working together. Apparently they are. \"We may occasionally disagree on matters of substance \u2026 but I have to say that I really admire his style.\"</p> <p>And so does Mr Hayes. At last, they agree on something.</p>",
  "<p>On Friday, the October employment numbers will be revealed, and they are not expected to be particularly good. In four days, Americans will vote on a president.</p> <p>The connection of these two events cannot be ignored. The political punditry has widely speculated that no matter how the economy is going, voters will make their decision for a new president based on their views of the economy \u2013 that President Obama will have a harder time if the jobs numbers are bad, and Governor Mitt Romney may get a boost.</p> <p>This would be a mistaken way to cast a vote. In economics and psychology, there is a phenomenon known as \"recency bias,\" which we've all experienced even without knowing it: the most recent thing that happens seems to have the greatest effect on the future, whether it is actually important or not. For instance, if your brother-in-law borrows money and pays it back every time except the last one, it's the last time that will influence you to think that perhaps you would be unwise to lend money to your brother-in-law. In other words: our whole view of track records is skewed.</p> <p>So by election day, the most recent jobs report has a psychological impact that is pretty big, because it's the last thing about the economy we will remember as we go out to vote.</p> <p>There is little doubt that tomorrow's jobs report will be negative news, even if it adds jobs, as many expect. (Barclays, for instance, advised its banking clients to expect a modestly positive jobs report this week.)</p> <p>The news will be negative, no matter what, because the employment snapshot of America, as a whole, is so bleak. As University of Maryland professor Peter Morici pointed out in a report this week, \"the jobless rate has fallen mostly because 6 milion adults have chosen not to look for work. [Except] for this phenomenon, the unemployment rate would still be 9.7%. More than 8 million part time workers would like full time work but can't find it. Adding in those folks, the unemployment rate is 14.7%.\"</p> <p>What is remarkable is that the employment statistics stay stubbornly low while, elsewhere in the economy, there are signs that a true recovery may be stirring. Barclays analyst Pierro Ghezzi wrote a note this week titled \"Tentative Signs of a Recovery,\" which concluded: \"On balance, recent global economic releases have been stronger than expected, appearing to confirm that global economic activity is picking up, albeit modestly.\" He included the US in that estimation, saying that the economy was \"at a crossroads,\" but that there were positive signs of growth for the next three months.</p> <p>There are other economic indicators that give us a clearer view of the U.S. economy as a whole and how it's doing right now.</p> <p>These indicators tell us that the labor market is strengthening as productivity increases and workers pick up high-wage jobs as well as the low-wage ones; that consumers and businesses feel more optimistic; that they're looking to buy real estate and cars and going to banks for the money to borrow to make those purchases. They tell us that manufacturing - brought low earlier this year \u2013 is rebounding a bit; that personal income is increasing at the fastest pace in six months; that consumers are spending money in stores, resulting in better retail sales; and the housing market is strong enough that homebuilders are seeing their stocks rise and new home sales are rising fast.</p> <p>Of course, not everyone's in on this recovery surge. Businesses have been putting in lower orders for good. Other indicators also tell us that companies have been holding back in other ways this year, worried about issues like the fiscal cliff and the outcome of the election. The vastly different political implications of an Obama administration or a Romney one have caused some companies to hit the brakes until they decide how to proceed. Companies have not been growing their earnings like they used to. Peter Tchir, of TF Market Advisors, summed it up: \"Earnings suck. I was looking for a kinder word, but I think 'suck' works. Companies are missing the already lowered expectations and are almost universally less excited about next quarter.\"</p> <p>While that doesn't sound like good news \u2013 and it isn't, for those who own the stock of those companies \u2013 it does indicate, if you're an optimist, that there's lots of room for improvement. Tchir, for instance, pronounced himself reluctant to go \"bearish,\" or have a negative view on the economy. Barclays believes that economic growth will continue, and many other economists and analysts agree.</p> <p>The improvement in so many other economic indicators, while employment numbers remain dismal, may be an indication that the employment numbers don't really help us judge our current economy as well as we wish they would.</p> <p>Employment numbers are what is known as a lagging economic indicator, because they don't indicate how the economy is doing now; they indicate, at best, how it was doing, a month ago or even a few months ago. The reasoning for calling employment an lagging indicator is easy to understand: by the time people lose their jobs, things are already pretty bad. And when things start to pick up, jobs aren't the first sign that things are changing.</p> <p>It also doesn't help that the actual jobs and employment numbers are infamously vague and not tremendously informative. There are two main sources: the bureau of labor statistics, which is the much-watched government report, and payroll provider ADP, which is generally seen as a supplement to the BLS report but is taken less seriously. </p> <p>These numbers could make your head spin with their unreliability. ADP, for instance, released its employment report today. It said that in October, the economy added 158,000 jobs. That seems like good news, particularly because the prevailing expectation was for 135,000 jobs.</p> <p>But in that same report, ADP said that it had revised September's numbers, and they were much more disappointing than it had first thought.</p> <p>ADP said they were only 88,200 jobs added in September, after previously saying there were 162,000 jobs added. That's a big error.</p> <p>Similarly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says it can regularly be off the mark by 100,000 jobs in its monthly estimates. When the economy is barely adding that many jobs in the first place, that's another huge area of potential error.</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest economic data point that voters can take into the voting booth is this: the president, while having tremendous power over legislation, does not control the economy alone. He (or some day, she) depends on Congress, the Federal Reserve, small-business owners, corporations and even other countries to help support the American economy.</p> <p>The biggest fallacy of any election is that one man can cause, or fix, all of our economic ills.</p>",
  "<p>In other circumstances, it might be flattering that Jonathan Freedland sets such great store by the capacity of the Stop the War Coalition to mobilise its members. But he misrepresents nearly everything to do with our policy (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/19/condemn-israel-why-silence-on-syria\" title=\"\">We condemn Israel. So why the silence on Syria?</a>, 20 October).</p> <p>He criticises double standards among anti-war campaigners: we demonstrated in large numbers against the bombing of Gaza in 2008-9, but \"the Stop the War Coalition is not summoning thousands to central London to demand an end to the fighting [in Syria], as it did then\". Freedland argues that we therefore suffer a \"very parochial form of internationalism\" because we are \"turning a blind eye\" to areas where the British government is not involved.</p> <p>Given the wide areas of the globe in which Britain is or has been involved in wars or colonial occupations, surely the main target of anti-war campaigning here must be the British government? It has a long record of supporting Israel in its oppression of the Palestinians. The Quartet's envoy for peace in the Middle East is Tony Blair, architect of the most disastrous war in modern times and an enthusiast for bombing Iran. Meanwhile the existence of a major nuclear arsenal in Israel is ignored by our government, as is the development of illegal Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.</p> <p>Operation Cast Lead was the deliberate targeting of the Palestinians in Gaza by a highly sophisticated air force funded and armed by the US and its allies. Freedland talks of a \"bias against Jews that regards an Arab or Muslim death as only deserving condemnation when Israel is responsible\". This dangerously confuses criticism of Israel's domestic and foreign policy with bias against Jewish people. The international outcry sparked by this daily bombardment represented opposition to Israeli policy and in the UK was a condemnation of our own government's collusion.</p> <p>The conflict in Syria has become a civil war. Contrary to Freedland's claims that western intervention is nigh on impossible, the west and its supporters \u2013 Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar \u2013 are already directly intervening, providing arms and other military support. Their interests are hardly humanitarian, given Saudi Arabia's terrible human rights record and Turkey's longstanding oppression of the Kurds. They are about strategic power and control in the region, which is why those now intervening in Syria also want regime change in Iran.</p> <p>We have been here before. The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya were all portrayed as helping the peoples of those countries. They have caused untold misery and extremely high death tolls. Stop&#xa0;the War campaigns to prevent the people of Syria suffering the same fate.</p> <p>Freedland is wrong to say that Stop the War is \"not active on Syria\". We have held a number of public meetings and demonstrations on Syria and Iran, including a well attended fringe meeting at the Labour party conference which he seems to have overlooked. But their theme is against western intervention in those countries, rather than taking a position about what is happening domestically. We take the view that it is for Syrians to decide what happens in Syria.</p> <p>\"Every life has equal worth,\" says Freedland. Of course. Perhaps he should&#xa0;direct his criticism at those carrying out drone attacks in Pakistan, or bombing children in Afghanistan. It&#xa0;is&#xa0;a bizarre sense of priorities that leads him to attack peace campaigners rather than warmongers.</p>",
  "<p>Life in America's hurricane battered north-east slowly headed towards normality on Thursday as presidential election campaigning resumed, public transport networks struggled to life and power began to come back on.</p> <p>But the impact of devastating superstorm Sandy was still being felt across the region as more of the damage inflicted by the history-making weather system was revealed, the death toll more than 140, with 74 dead in the US, many more missing and some five million people were still without electricity.</p> <p>New Jersey remained the centre of destruction as state officials began to count the cost of the direct hit on the state's famed Jersey Shore of beach towns, casinos and boardwalks. It is thought Sandy will inflict $30bn of damage in New Jersey alone.</p> <p>In Hoboken, just across the Hudson river from New York, the US National Guard patrolled debris-strewn flooded streets in Humvees hoping to evacuate 20,000 stranded residents. City officials there had launched a desperate appeal for supplies of flashlights, food, generators, fuel and water.</p> <p>All along the coastline of New Jersey, scenes of disaster emerged, from shattered boardwalks, to coast roads suddenly turned into beaches, to houses reduced to piles of wood. In south Mantoloking, the ruins of home still smouldered after a terrible fire. In Sayreville, it emerged that almost 200 people had been rescued by boat. In Atlantic City, local officials contemplated a huge blow to their casino-based economy amid streets that had been flooded waist deep. In Jersey City, a curfew was put in effect. Across the state, huge queues built up at petrol stations as desperate drivers tried to fill up their cars amid a tightening of supplies.</p> <p>In Seaside Heights, rows of houses had been effectively flattened by Sandy's enormous flood surge. Seaside's boardwalk, which featured in MTV's hit reality show Jersey Shore, has been uprooted, amusement rides beside Casino Pier have been swept into the sea, and sand covered coastal streets and houses. City officials simply asked people to leave town. \"We have to get everyone off the island because there is total devastation,\" Seaside Heights police chief Thomas Boyd said at an earlier press conference.</p> <p>One of the main problems many areas have faced is that the flood waters are polluted with oil and chemicals after Sandy struck such a built-up part of the country. Officials also warned that 336,000 gallons of diesel fuel had spilled into the waters around Staten Island and New Jersey after a storage tank was ruptured and lifted from its holdings. Authorities say the fuel, which leaked at the Motiva oil tank facility in Woodbridge, was now contained in booms on the ocean.</p> <p>In New York, however, there were increasing signs of life as America's largest city struggled \u2013 sometimes chaotically \u2013 to get back to normality. Commuter railway lines sputtered back to life but were inundated with customers. So was the subway system as a limited service began and was immediately swamped by people who began queuing up at 5am to catch a train. The city's streets were often clogged with traffic and massive jams built up as Mayor Michael Bloomberg tried to control the number of cars in the city by barring any carrying less than three passengers.</p> <p>Bloomberg was also currently resisting calls to cancel the New York marathon scheduled for Sunday. Numerous politicians have appealed for him to scrap the event as the city copes with aftershock of Sandy, but so far the famous road race remains on track to takee place. \"It's a great event for New York, and I think for those who were lost, you've got to believe they would want us to have an economy and have a city go on,\" Bloomberg said.</p> <p>All three main airports in the New York area were also expected to be operational on Thursday after waters receded from LaGuardia, the final airport to open, which sits just a few feet above sea level by the East river.</p> <p>However, as working life returned to some areas of New York, many neighbourhoods were still without power. ConEdison reported that 719,000 of its own customers in the New York area were without power, with 227,000 of those in Manhattan though it was predicting full power would be restored there by Saturday. But for the moment, life in downtown Manhattan is still an eerie experience for those suddenly taken back to living an electricity-free era. Many thousands of residents have simply left to stay with friends and family in other parts of the city. Others are putting up with darkened hallways, no lifts and living by candlelight.</p> <p>Though a few restaurants and food shops are open, the vast majority of businesses on the usually frantic and busy city streets are closed. Many of the areas more famous residents have fled the usually fashionable neighbourhood. The New York Post reported that film stars like Naomi Watts and Russell Crowe, model Helena Christensen and Vogue editor Anna Wintour had all fled uptown for the plush Mark Hotel on the Upper East Side.</p> <p>Others had less options. Diane Ward, a 76-year-old who has lived in the East Village neighbourhood for 45 years, stayed put to look after her cat. She had just gone to a local home supplies store that was hawking candles and batteries on the street. \"I bought some candles,\" she explained. \"It is depressing inside when you are living by flashlight. Candles are much nicer.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, America's election campaign was back in top gear.</p> <p>President Barack Obama had visited New Jersey on Wednesday in the company of its Republican governor Chris Christie, who is usually a staunch critic. But that rare political truce was over on Thursday as both Obama joined Republican challenger Mitt Romney back on the campaign trail.</p> <p>In Wisconsin, Obama implicitly reminded his audience of Romney's habit of making dramatic changes on issues. \"You know what I believe. You know where I stand. You know that I'll make tough political decisions even when they are not popular,\" Obama said. \"After all we've been through together, we can't give up now.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Romney was back on the attack, mentioning the president by name for the first time in two days. At a campaign stop in Virginia he slammed an Obama idea to create a new government agency to help businesses create jobs. \"I don't think adding a new chair to his cabinet will help add millions of jobs on Main Street,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Romney's campaign also released a highly aggressive attack ad in Florida, linking Obama to high-profile socialists in Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.</p>",
  "<p>Every day three scenes, on the surface unconnected, unfold in different corners of the world. By breakfast time in Macau, China's gambling mecca, thousands of people are inside vast casino resorts spending money on baccarat, poker, slot machines and restaurants. Managers monitor the profit by the hour.</p> <p>By lunchtime in Israel commuters and shoppers are perusing Israel Hayom, a brash giveaway tabloid and the country's most-read newspaper. It supports the government of Binyamin Netanyahu. And it clobbers rival dailies to the point of extinction.</p> <p>By dinnertime viewers in Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Nevada and other swing states in the US presidential election are watching, for the umpteenth time that day, television advertisements attacking Barack Obama and promoting Mitt Romney. Their volume and cost have set records.</p> <p>This eclectic, global triptych is connected by a fourth, less visible scene. In the quiet hum of his air-conditioned Las Vegas headquarters a short, portly man with thinning red hair absorbs reports detailing it all, Macau, Israel, the election, because in every one he is a player. He crunches the profits, circulation and polling and ponders his next move. His name is Sheldon Adelson, and he is one of the world's richest men.</p> <p>\"I suppose you could say that I live on Vince Lombardi's belief. Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing,\" <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81588.html\">he told a recent interviewer,</a> citing the legendary American football coach. \"So, I do whatever it takes, as long as it's moral, ethical, principled, legal.\"</p> <p>No one doubts Adelson, 79, lives to win. But with the White House race entering the final stretch of what both sides call the most important election in decades there is growing controversy over his business interests and methods.</p> <p>\"I've studied Sheldon Adelson closely but I don't claim to know him,\" said John L Smith, a Las Vegas-based author and columnist who tangled with him in a bitter court case. \"I'm like a kid at the zoo watching the big predator but not understanding.\"</p> <p>How the son of immigrants \u2013 Adelson's Lithuanian-born father was a taxi driver, his British-born mother a seamstress \u2013 rose from poverty in Boston's tough Dorchester district to become a force in global politics and commerce is, depending on your perspective, an inspiring story of entrepreneurial grit and flair, or a cautionary tale of plutocracy and democratic dysfunction.</p> <p>Adelson, with a fortune valued at over $20bn, controls a unique web linking gaming empires in Nevada and Asia, media control in Israel and mega-donations to Romney and other Republican candidates.</p> <p>He represents a new breed of tycoon, said Chrystia Freeland, the editor of Thomson Reuters Digital and author of Plutocrats: the rise of the new global super-rich and the fall of everyone else. \"The caricature is of conspicuous consumption, yachts and jets, but for the super-rich the real status symbol is having a voice, having an impact on public policy, and in that sense Sheldon is characteristic of his class.\"</p> <p>He is not shy about declaring his wealth. \"You know,\" <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/30/080630fa_fact_bruck#ixzz2A4OeCImt\">he reportedly bragged to George W Bush</a>, when he was president in 2008, \"I am the richest Jew in the world.\"</p> <p>If few knew that then, many know now. Adelson has burst onto the international stage by becoming, as one observer noted, \"sugar daddy\" to zionist and conservative causes.</p> <p>He is a modern Croesus who converts cash into influence. The question, which to critics becomes more urgent with each day of the campaign, is the extent to which he may convert, or try to convert, influence into cash. In a written reply to Guardian questions, Adelson said he wished only that the White House invite him to its annual Hanukah party and save him some potato pancakes.</p> <h2>'He doesn't give up'</h2> <p>A Romney victory could yield Adelson billions in tax cuts and make the White House an ally. His businesses are under investigation from the justice department and other agencies over alleged wrongdoing in Asia.</p> <p>There was little in his background to suggest Adelson would become the right's impresario. Reared in liberal Massachusetts, he worked his way through multiple jobs \u2013 vending machine salesman, court reporter, real estate dealer, toiletries packager \u2013 and scored big with Comdex, a computer trade show he launched in 1979.</p> <p>In 1988 he bought a chunk of the Sands hotel and casino, a fading, one-time rat pack haunt and turned it into Las Vegas Sands Corporation, a glitzy triumph with the Venetian as its flagship. He gambled, correctly, that if he built convention centres conferences would flock to Sin City.</p> <p>Even in a town known to be filled with tough operators, Adelson's steeliness stood out. He drove aides as hard as he did himself, did not take no for an answer, and did not forgive trespasses.</p> <p>He successfully sued the Daily Mail for libel and in a separate case went after Smith and his publisher, Barricade Books, over a depiction of Adelson in Smith's book Sharks in the Desert.</p> <p>Threatened with a $15m lawsuit, the publisher entered bankruptcy and agreed to a judgement of libel. Smith also entered bankruptcy. A judge dismissed the suit against him and ordered Adelson to pay some of the author's costs. \"He's a real sweetheart,\" said Smith. \"He doesn't give up.\"</p> <p>Ron Reese, a spokesman who who has represented Adelson for a decade, defended his boss. \"It is easy to be a critic of someone if you don't know them, haven't taken the time to learn about their values, or if you are simply jealous of their accomplishments. It's a lot like criticising the coaches and players of a football match you didn't watch or attend. The fact is, Mr Adelson is among the world's greatest philanthropists and has created tens of thousands of jobs throughout his business career.\"</p> <p>What vaulted Adelson into a league Donald Trump can only dream of was Macau, the former Portuguese colony that is part of China and hosts gambling under the \"one country, two systems formula\".</p> <p>He outfoxed rival casino moguls to open the territory's first Las Vegas-style resort, the Sands Macao, in 2004. In reality it is two vast resorts, one of them the world's biggest. On its first day the crowd reportedly ripped doors off their hinges in a stampede for the gaming tables. Adelson recouped his $265m investment within a year.</p> <p>\"In 2004-5 the big question was when Macau would overtake Las Vegas; it was taking about $4bn to Las Vegas's $6bn. Now Macau is taking nearly $40bn a year - and Las Vegas is still on about $6bn,\" said Aaron Fischer, head of consumer and gaming research at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets.</p> <p>Asia \u2013 he expanded into Singapore \u2013 has made him a multi-billionaire. \"Other guys have made promises that may be they weren't able to deliver on. Sheldon stuck to the promises that he made [to officials] even though they have not always been perceived to have the best relationship,\" said Fischer.</p> <p>\"He doesn't have a reputation for always saying the right thing. I really think he's a character. I respect him and I find him to be quite honest and very down to earth. Maybe that's sometimes been his problem; he's not very good at diplomacy.\"</p> <p>Sergio Terra, editorial executive director of the Portugese-language newspaper Tribuna Macau, said Chinese officials bristled even as they benefited from Adelson's investment.</p> <p>\"He wanted everything and everything first. That's not the way the Macau government works. And he had to adjust to the Beijing approach. They don't like pressure.\"</p> <p>One veteran observer of the casino industry, who declined to be named, said Adelson charged through barriers. \"It's served him well but he might have knocked down a few too many and used weapons that are going to be subject to review by regulators. I think his quest is to be the world's richest man \u2013 I don't think he's made any secret of that. He's always referring to his ranking.\"</p> <p>Las Vegas Sands faces three lawsuits over its Macau operations: a former executive, Steve Jacobs, claims wrongful dismissal and alleges the company collaborated with triads and sought to blackmail officials. The company is also snagged in a bribery scandal and claims it violated US anti-money laundering laws. Adelson vehemently denies wrongdoing. \"We're going to be found absolutely clean,\" he said last year. The company blamed the accusations on disgruntled former employees.</p> <h2>Breaking into the Israeli newspaper market</h2> <p>Macau is the golden egg, but Israel is Adelson's enduring passion. The mogul often tells the story how he stepped off the plane for the first time wearing the shoes of his late father, who had been too poor to travel. His commitment has grown since marrying his second wife, Miriam, an Israeli, in 1991.</p> <p>The Adelsons have underwritten think tanks, exchange programmes, DC-based lobby groups and, most controversially, the interests of Netanyahu. Adelson believes Israel's hawkish prime minister is a necessary bulwark to supposed peace talks and Palestinian statehood, a prospect he abhors.</p> <p>After false starts, Adelson established his tabloid, Israel Hayom, in 2007. It now has a 38% share of the weekday newspaper market, compared to 36% for its main rival Yedioth Ahronoth, 11% for Ma'ariv and 7% for Haaretz.</p> <p>The heavily advertised paper is given away by uniformed distributors on the streets, outside supermarkets and at gas stations. It also has paid home-delivery sales.</p> <p>Its partisanship earned the nicknamed \"Bibiton\", a play on the prime minister's nickname and the Hebrew word for newspaper.</p> <p>Many have blamed it for the catastrophic demise of paid-for newspapers. Maariv faces possible closure. Haaretz is also in crisis, with layoffs and pay cuts looming. Yedioth announced cutbacks earlier this year, including dozens of job losses.</p> <p>The Israeli business website Globes quoted a senior Yedioth executive as saying: \"You must know that Israel Hayom is destroying Israeli journalism not only at the professional level, with its embarrassing editorial conduct, but also at the economic level.\"</p> <p>Israel Hayom was breaking the market with ads at zero cost, crippling rivals' revenue streams, he said. \"Israel Hayom has finished Ma'ariv, and it is now finishing Haaretz. Adelson has simply brought ruin.\"</p> <p>The mogul's friends disagree. \"He put his money up for an alternative voice and people liked it. That's capitalism,\" said Sig Rogich, a businessman and media consultant in Las Vegas. Rogich also defended his friend's plunge into this year's US presidential and congressional races after years of confining himself to Nevada politics.

How do you respond?</strong></p> <p><strong>SA: </strong>I would be entitled to no preferential tax cuts or any other type of preferential treatment whatsoever. Any tax cuts that would apply to me would apply to President Obama, his wealthy donors, and everyone else. By the way, what is wrong with supporting a candidate whose economic views and values are the same as yours?</p> <p><strong>Guardian: It's been said of you that you are probably the most aggressive, unforgiving individual in the business world today. What do you say to that?</strong></p> <p><strong>SA:</strong> Friends I've had for as long as 70 years would never match that word with me or my way of life. The word unforgiving and my name don't belong together \u2013 it is inconsistent with my concept of giving away much more than I make or spend on my family to help repair the world \u2013 through our drug treatment centers which rehabilitate drug addicts, specifically women who turn to prostitution because of drugs; our medical research foundation; the strong support we provide for our military veterans here in the United States and many other causes.</p>",
  "<p>Customers coming in out of the rain to the near-empty Comet store on London's Old Kent Road yesterday had mostly not heard that the lossmaking chain was about to go into administration \u2013 but when told the news they said they were not surprised.</p> <p>One man in his 30s summed up the retailer's problems in a few words: \"The others are just better,\" he said.</p> <p>The choice of products on offer was not good, he said. He wanted to buy a set of speakers for his living room and was only able to find one in the shelves. Like other customers, he pointed out there was a large Currys just across the road.</p> <p>\"I double-check prices\", said another. As long as it was cheaper he would still buy at the struggling Comet, but would would not be buying vouchers in case the chain did not survive.</p> <p>He emphasised that he was not a fan of buying over the internet, because he wanted to see products and touch them.</p> <p>A woman in her 50s, looking for a new washing machine, was reluctant to buy at this store. \"Years ago I had problems with a Comet's insurance.

  "<p>Barclays was insistent last night that it would defend itself against a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/01/barclay-banking\" title=\"\">potential $470m (\u00a3290m) fine for allegations it attempted to rig electricity prices</a> even as the US regulator making the accusations published embarrassing emails sent by four former traders of the bank.</p> <p>The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has given Barclays and the four traders 30 days to respond to its allegations, supported its claims with emails and instant messages, written in trader jargon, in which traders boasted they would \"crap on\" prices and how they \"totally fuckked\" (sic) with markets.</p> <p>The allegations shed some light on the complexities of energy trading and single out four locations \u2013 Columbia, Palo Verde, South Path 15 and North Path 15 \u2013 that were said to have been used by the traders to benefit the bank's positions on the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE).</p> <p>In one instant message sent to a colleague, Ryan Smith, wrote \"I totally fuckked (sic) with the Palo mrkt today \u2026 look at my deals on ICE\". As the series of instant messages continued, Smith concluded: \"I just started lifting the piss out of the palo.\"</p> <p>The alleged offences, which the regulator claims caused losses of $139m for rivals and allowed Barclays to make $35m of profit, are said to have taken place between 2006 and 2008 by a team of traders led by Scott Connelly, hired in May 2006, whom the Ferc wants to fine $15m.</p> <p>Smith has been warned of a $1m fine, along with Daniel Brin and Karen Levine who are also facing similar fines. The so-called <a href=\"http://www.ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20121031172428-IN08-8-000.pdf\" title=\"\">show-cause document published by the Ferc </a>shows that the four insist they did nothing wrong.</p> <p>Ferc accuses the four traders, who sat on the so-called west power desk, and Barclays of being involved in a \"co-ordinated scheme\" for 655 days which involved taking losses in one part of the electricity market known as the \"physical\" to move prices in financial contracts linked to the prices of electricity. The Ferc used another message from Brin, in which he explained he is \"doing phys[ical] so i (sic) am trying to drive price in fin[ancial} direction\", to support its claim.</p> <p>Barclays, which was fined a record \u00a3290m for attempting to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate, said it \"strongly\" disagreed with allegations. \"We believe that our trading was legitimate and in compliance with applicable law. The [Ferc order] is by its very nature a one-sided document, and does not reflect a balanced and full description of the facts or the applicable legal standard,\" Barclays said.</p> <p>Stressing it had co-operated with the investigation, which began in 2007, the bank's spokesman said: \"We intend to vigorously defend this matter\".</p> <p>Unlike Libor where the penalty was agreed by Barclays in a settlement with three regulators, including the Financial Services Authority in the UK, Barclays may need to take proceedings to court if it is to fend off the penalty proposed by Ferc.</p> <p>The energy regulator included remarks by Joseph Gold, head of commodities for Barclays in the US, who in his evidence to Ferc insisted he had made clear that traders deliberating making losses was unacceptable. \"The golden rule was always, under no circumstances, lose money on a transaction for the intention of making money on another transaction,\" Gold said.</p> <p>The $490m penalty is based on a $435m fine and the disgorgement of the $35m profit the bank is alleged to have made. The investigation began after Ferc received calls from market participants to its hotline.</p> <p>The Californian electricity market was the subject of scrutiny after the collapse of Enron when regulators produced documents showing that strategies named Fat Boy and Get Shorty were used to try to increase profits from trading power in the western US state,</p>",
  "<p>For Beijing residents to understand the gravity of the upcoming 18th congress of the Chinese Communist party, they need only to take a taxi. Or buy a toy. Or own a pigeon.</p> <p>While the Chinese government often boosts security during sensitive political meetings, measures surrounding the forthcoming congress border on extreme: Authorities have placed restrictions on buying remote-controlled helicopters, warned cab drivers to child-lock their doors, and instructed pigeon-fanciers to keep their birds caged.</p> <p>During the congress, which begins next Thursday, more than 2,000 delegates from across the country will gather in Beijing to approve a once in a decade leadership transition. Seven out of the country's nine top leaders will step down, including president Hu Jintao and prime minister Wen Jiabao.</p> <p>Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher in Hong Kong, said the authorities' clampdown on seemingly banal activities springs from an \"overabundance of caution\". \"They can't control everything, but they will do their best to try,\" he said.</p> <p>Chinese social-networking websites are rife with anecdotes about vanishing street food stalls and overbearing new security checks at train stations. Conferences, music festivals, football matches, and even the internationally well regarded Beijing marathon have been <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-10/25/content_15847553.htm\" title=\"\">cancelled at short notice</a>.</p> <p>Shopkeepers have been instructed to remove sharp items such as kitchen knives and pencil sharpeners from their shelves. The Happiness Supermarket in central Beijing replaced its stock of knives with neat rows of can openers and potato peelers. \"The police came in and said we're just not allowed to sell them,\" said an employee.</p> <p>There have been even stranger developments. Beijing's taxi drivers have been instructed to dismantle their backseat window cranks and child-lock their doors. \"The company management said at the meeting that in the past, some passengers had thrown leaflets out of the taxi window,\" <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/740900.shtml\" title=\"\">one driver told the Global Times</a>. A widely circulated post on Sina Weibo, the popular microblogging website, shows an ostensibly leaked set of rules for taxi drivers to follow during the congress. One instructs them to refrain from driving through \"areas of political importance\". Another warns them to keep an eye out for passengers holding slogan-bearing balloons and \"<a href=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2012/10/taxi-zero-spread-rule-for-18th-party-congress/\" title=\"\">ping-pong balls bearing reactionary messages</a>\".</p> <p>Balloons and model planes have been banned during the congress, according to the state-run Global Times newspaper, which also quoted a police officer as saying that pigeon enthusiasts \u2013 ubiquitous in the city's old-fashioned neighbourhoods \u2013 must keep their birds grounded.</p> <p>Official notices have appeared on toy-store sales counters restricting the sales of remote-controlled helicopters \u2013 aspiring customers must now register at nearby police stations with their government-issued IDs, reported the Beijing Youth Daily.</p> <p>The security effort is striking if only for its sheer scale. Beijing authorities have \"processed\" 33,000 cases of \"illegal activities\" such as gambling, prostitution and unlicensed taxis since August, according to Xinhua, China's official newswire. Some 1.4 million volunteers have been recruited to bolster the capital's security presence. 1,725 businesses have been shut down.</p> <p>The former political prisoner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hu-jia\" title=\"\">Hu Jia</a> said in a phone interview that he has been under tight surveillance since 18 September, when rumours about the conference date started to spread(The authorities did not announce the meeting's actual starting date until September 28th).</p> <p>On 20 October, state security officers escorted Hu to a train station in Beijing and bundled him off to his hometown in Anhui province. Hu said the police threatened his parents with violence if he returned to Beijing before the end of the meeting.</p> <p>\"This has been way worse than the 17th party congress,\" Hu said, referring to a similar event in 2007, while he was formally under house arrest. \"At that time I was allowed to go out and buy things to eat. This time there's just no way.\"</p> <p>Wu Lihong, an activist who was jailed from 2007 to 2010 for his environmental campaigning, said that the police have not allowed him to travel since the summer.</p> <p>Yet according to Wu, police in his hometown near Lake Tai in Jiangsu province were afraid that sympathetic neighbors would help him flee to Beijing, so offered to take him on a chaperoned \"vacation\" to scenic Huang Mountain in Anhui Province until late November.</p> <p>\"They say let's go look at the scenery, it's really beautiful, we'll go travel,\" Wu said in a phone interview from Lake Tai. \"But I won't go, and this gives them a headache.\"</p> <p>Zhang Feng, an official at the ministry of industry and information technology, denied rumours that China's internet will be shut down during the 18th party congress. But, Zhang told the 21st Century Business Herald newspaper, it will undergo maintenance \"<a href=\"http://www.21cbh.com/HTML/2012-10-26/0MNDE1XzU0ODg0MA.html\" title=\"\">to guarantee the conference can smoothly complete its work duties</a>\".

  "<p>What times we live in: strange and mutable, packed with incident. But every so often, something occurs that makes the very ground shake beneath us, an event of such importance that those who witness it feel the world stop for a moment, before continuing: but different now, changed for ever. We take these events with us to the grave, remembering not only their details, but&#xa0;the details of our own lives at the moment they occurred. In years to come, we feel driven to recall both, wryly contrasting the mundanity of the latter with the magnitude of the former.</p> <p>Lost in Showbiz feels confident that, at some distant point in the future, children too young to remember Tuesday 30 October 2012 firsthand will look to those who bore witness and plaintively ask us: \"What were you doing when former Celebrity Big Brother contestant Chantelle Houghton<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/lostinshowbiz/2012/oct/30/chantelle-houghton-sex-dungeon-twitter\" title=\"\"> revealed that her ex-partner, cross-dressing cage fighter Alex 'The Reidinator' Reid, had 'turned my house into a sex dungeon'?</a>\"</p> <p>For a mercy, there isn't space here to go into the full chain of events that led up to Houghton's Twitter explosion: the marriage proposal on live TV, the breakup, Reid's demand that Houghton stop airing their grievances in public \u2013 a&#xa0;demand fairly mind-bogglingly made in a video shot by Now! magazine during an interview with showbiz reporter Dan Wootton.</p> <p>But even before his former partner took to the microblogging site, it was shaping up to be a bad week even by the standards of The Reidinator, a man who earlier this year had to contend with his ex-wife Katie Price enlivening a press conference to promote her new&#xa0;novel by informing the assembled journalists that she had once stuck a vodka bottle up his bum. There was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/31/review-come-dine-with-me-halloween\" title=\"\">an appearance on Celebrity Come Dine With Me</a>, during which Reid's cage-fighting tough-guy image took a bit of a knock when he was relentlessly bullied by, of all people, TV medium \"Psychic\" Sally Morgan, his woes compounded by glamour model Nicola McLean offering her frank appraisal of his personality: \"I think he's a bit of a twat.\" Worse, the resulting programme was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/nov/01/alex-reid-come-dine-with-me\" title=\"\">outranked in the ratings by both Autumnwatch and Watchdog</a>. But such&#xa0;things paled into insignificance following Houghton's online tirade, in which she also accused him of texting prostitutes about orgies, arranging to meet a man \"for sex\" while dressed as his alter-ego Roxanne, and trying to get his hands on money placed in a trust fund for their daughter.</p> <p>And yet, at the sex dungeon revelation, Lost in Showbiz found itself swelling with a certain admiration for Price's hapless former paramour. For one thing, there was Houghton's insistence that he had thus transformed her home when she was eight months pregnant with their child. Lost in Showbiz doesn't know how much experience its readers have of heavily pregnant women, but it can remember only too vividly the tsunami of wildly unpredictable hormonally driven emotions that constituted the latter months of its own wife's pregnancy, a&#xa0;period of its life that Lost in Showbiz spent in a permanent state of bafflement and fear, having quickly realised the most innocuous of queries, suggestions or actions could provoke a&#xa0;tearful screaming fit. It recalls with a shudder the evening that the question \"this gravy's nice, what's in it?\" was inexplicably answered with a lengthy and expletive-laden monologue, delivered at enormous volume centimetres away from Lost in Showbiz's face, in which its multitude of failings as a husband and indeed human being were expounded on in wounding detail. Frankly, by the time its wife was eight months gone, Lost in Showbiz was so terrified of her that it wouldn't turn over the TV without getting written permission first. Given that, at the same period in his partner's pregnancy, The Reidinator apparently took it on himself to turn her house into a sex dungeon without telling her, Lost in Showbiz can only boggle at his fearlessness. This man doesn't deserve our opprobrium, he deserves a medal for bravery. What a pity this year's Pride of Britain awards have already come and gone.</p> <p>Second, who can fail to be impressed by the sheer scale of the enterprise? After a thought-provoking afternoon's Googling, Lost in Showbiz can report that the internet abounds with websites offering helpful information on the construction of a DIY sex dungeon: presumably you don't just ring up your local builders and ask them to give you a quote for one (\"Are you Check-A-Trade registered? I'm looking for someone to make me a sex dungeon\"). Their advice ranges from the practical (\"a cheap Ikea overdoor shoebag makes&#xa0;ideal storage for sex toys and nipple clamps\") to the eye-watering (\"construct a testicular vice out of perspex so the victim's crushed flesh can be seen\") to sad tales of BDSM \"bloopers\" (\"unfortunately the load-bearing studs were not conveniently located for a fucking sling\"). But they all have one thing in common: they're about converting a single room. By Houghton's account, Reid converted her entire house. The remodelling works were so extensive she had to move out and \"sleep on my flat floor\".</p> <p>Without wishing to condone turfing a heavily pregnant woman out of her own home in order to create a more pleasing environment in which to slake your fell desires, Lost in Showbiz once again feels impelled to take its hat off to the Reidinator. A whole house! This is a man with vision! Come Dine With Me? He should have been on Grand Designs. What an episode that would be: Kevin McCloud sadly shaking his&#xa0;head as a supporting wall is inadvertently removed to make way for a mock gynaecological examination table, and earnestly asking: \"Did you not consider having this so-called 'rim chair' made out of <em>sustainable</em> materials?\" Lost in Showbiz doesn't want to tell Channel 4 its business, but it is fairly certain more people would tune into that than Autumnwatch.</p>",
  "<p>Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, on Thursdayintensified his dispute with the Liberal Democrat leadership over the future of Britain's nuclear weapons by saying that any alternative to the Trident submarine ballistic missile system was unlikely to be cheaper.</p> <p>Speaking days after Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, accused him of \"jumping the gun\" on Trident, Hammond told a defence conference in London: \"As it is well known, our Liberal Democrat coalition partners want to look at the alternatives that would still deliver a credible strategic nuclear deterrent.\"</p> <p>But he added: \"I think the problem in doing that is, if we were looking at a whole new system, maybe that's a question. But given that we have the warheads, we have the missiles, and we are only talking about replacing the submarine, it is difficult to envisage a new complete system which you have to design everything, warheads, missiles, carriers, platforms from scratch, could ever be a more economic proposition.\"</p> <p>Hammond later insisted Britain could afford a Trident replacement.</p> <p>Responding to a question after addressing a conference on air power organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi)on Thursday, Hammond said Britain's Trident missiles and warheads had \"many, many years of life left in them\". It was the four Vanguard class submarines that carried them that needed replacing.</p> <p>The Trident Alternatives Review, being carried out by the Cabinet Office, is due to be completed by the end of the year. Hammond also said on Thursday that the government was committed to maintaining a \"continuous at-sea deterrent\" \u2013 something the Liberal Democrats have not signed up to.</p> <p>The defence secretary added that over its lifetime the submarine-based Trident nuclear weapons system would cost about 6% of the defence budget to operate, less than the proportion of the French defence budget devoted to nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Hammond said the issue was not about the \"through-life cost\" of the system, but cash spikes in the 2020s and 2030s involved in replacing submarines. The planned new generation of Trident submarines are estimated to cost between \u00a320bn and \u00a325bn.</p> <p>Last night, on BBC's This Week, the former Conservative defence secretary Michael Portillo was asked whether he agreed with the Tory plan to renew Trident. He replied: \"No, I think it's all nonsense.\" Pressed further about whether he agreed with the nuclear deterrent, he said: \"No, I think it's completely past its sell-by date. It's neither independent, nor is it any kind of deterrent. It's a tremendous waste of money and is done entirely for reasons of national prestige. It's wasteful.\"</p> <p>Hammond also told the conference that US F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes will start to fly from the Queen Elizabeth, the first of two large aircraft carriers planned for the navy, in 2018. The two carriers, originally priced at \u00a33.5bn, are now estimated to cost \u00a36.2bn and could rise to \u00a312bn. High costs mean Britain will initially order only 40 F-35s, less than a third of the total originally planned, and only 12 would be based on an aircraft carrier.</p> <p>Hammond said the RAF and navy would work together to form a \"joint force\" that could operate from land bases in the UK, from carriers at sea, or from bases abroad. \"We have said that this is a decision that will be taken in the 2015 strategic defence and security review, whether the second carrier will be skeleton-crewed or whether it will effectively be mothballed,\" he said.</p> <p>The defence secretary sparked the row with comments made during a visit to the Trident base on the Clyde on Monday, when he appeared to suggest that the government was committed to a like-for-like Trident replacement.</p> <p>Clegg had responded: \"Let's remember the idea of a like-for-like, entirely unchanged, replacement for Trident is basically saying we will spend billions and billions and billions of pounds on a nuclear missile system, designed for the sole strategic purpose of flattening Moscow at the press of a button\".</p>",

I was at his full debut for the Fire against Chivas USA earlier this year, and while he had an eventful game (conceding a penalty, then scoring an equalizer a couple of minutes later), there wasn\u2019t much to suggest he would go on to have such a breakthrough season. That said, interviewing him afterwards I was impressed by how unfazed he was by the occasion - only becoming modestly excited with the news his family had flown in for the occasion.&#xa0;</p> <p>But when Arne Friedrich was out injured, rather than becoming unmoored without his more experienced counterpart, Berry grew in stature, and he and DC United\u2019s Nick DeLeon are now neck and neck for <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/10/24/rookie-rankings-two-left-standing-dust-clears-2012\">MLS 2012 Rookie of the Year</a>. For me, Berry\u2019s consistency has shaded it, despite how quickly DeLeon has integrated himself into his team. Berry has been steady in an exposed position, and even chipped in with goals, for his side, while DeLeon has been more eye-catching at times, but disappeared a little after a bright start. Both would be worthy winners, but after Tim Ream missed out a couple of years back, I'd like to see a good young defender rewarded.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5091c71295cb39eabe475ebc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T00:49:22.408Z\">12.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Houston Dynamo</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dominic Kinnear has a way of getting a side ready to peak at the play-offs. This year, he looked to have skipped a beat, as the Fire\u2019s late season surge coincided with a late season stutter by Houston. They were still difficult to beat, but too many ties were creeping into the equation, as the Dynamo slowly began to lose traction in the playoff race. A 3-1 win over Philadelphia on the penultimate weekend was good, but only negated the 3-1 loss they\u2019d suffered to the same opponents when the playoff contenders were beginning to shake out a month earlier.</p> <p>Pluses: designated player Oscar Boniek Garcia has slotted tidily into the 4-3-3 when it\u2019s employed and on his day is very hard for defenders to pick up (though the reluctance of Kandji to defend continually asks questions of a system designed in part to accommodate his undoubted pace and talent). Ricardo Clark is back with all his playoff experience, and Davis and his set pieces are still in the mix. Minuses: you can\u2019t replace a Geoff Cameron (sold to Stoke City) just like that - and the defense has been an issue. Whether they win or not tonight will depend on large part on their midfield smothering Chicago\u2019s and dominating possession. In an open game and a straight shootout, Chicago might well edge it.</p> <p>On a broader note, having completed their beautiful BBVA Compass Stadium this Spring, and ridden the attendant home bounce to an unbeaten record there, Houston could have done without their further participation in the play-offs being contingent on victory on the road tonight. Still the prize for victory is that with two legged semi-finals and finals to come, Houston\u2019s home form could yet be a significant factor in this competition - and of course they have the memory of what happened last year when they faced Philadelphia. Just like the Fire, the Union had lost momentum coming into the playoffs and the Dynamo duly eliminated them with a 2-1 victory at PPL Park followed by a routine 1-0 win at their old Robertson Stadium \u2014 sparking a run that took them all the way to the MLS Cup final.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5091c629b57959e43bca9544\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T00:45:29.473Z\">12.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chicago Fire</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The key to Chicago\u2019s line up for this game may now reside in Holland. Heerenveen signed Marco Pappa from the Fire in the summer and then promptly benched the former Chicago star. Around his departure and to a lesser extent the sudden absence of playmaker Grazzini, came a risky overhaul by Frank Klopas that could easily have been a tinkering too far - just see Vancouver Whitecaps having to hastily get back to basics, after their own revolving door gathered speed then threatened to run out of control this summer. Instead, aside from the disappointing Alvaro Fernandez, Chicago developed a more multi-faceted and productive attack for much of the second half of the season. Fan favorite Chris Rolfe returned and was able to play a slightly unfamiliar role to great effect, ensuring that Grazinni, seemingly permanently exiled to Argentina, was not unduly missed. Playmaker is not what Rolfe really does, but in linking the midfield and attack and chipping in his share of goals (8), alongside new designated player, Sherjill Macdonald (4) he helped the Fire go on a run of 8 wins in 9 games, through August and September.&#xa0;</p> <p>It was a run that was bookended by a draw in San Jose and a 2-0 road loss to Sporting Kansas City. The latter game - billed as a potential Eastern decider, seemed to knock the rampant Fire team off track. They lost next time out to Philadelphia, rallied to beat a New York side with problems of their own, then suffered another embarrassing loss in New England, before last weekend\u2019s decisive and disappointing draw against DC.&#xa0;</p> <p>Still, there\u2019ve been signs that the defense, marshalled by German veteran Arne Friedrich and the blossoming talent of rookie Austin Berry, has settled again, and they\u2019ll be tough for Houston to break down. Here\u2019s what happened when the sides last met, during that run by the Fire in the Fall.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVxmctbKTbY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nVxmctbKTbY?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5091c44eb57959e43bca9543\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T00:37:35.116Z\">12.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Welcome to the first of the wild-card games that will narrow the field for MLS Cup - as Chicago Fire host Houston Dynamo. And it should be an absorbing struggle, as two of the teams in the East who\u2019ve both enjoyed their moments in the sun this year, face off against each other, with one side, Chicago, slipping rather alarmingly from the form that catapulted them into the playoff mix, and the other, Houston, seeming to run out of steam as their season, front-loaded with road trips while their stadium was being finished, began to lose momentum with the addition of Champions league fixtures and a general uncertainty over what system worked best for them.</p> <p>Both sides have rather limped over the line, though Houston at least got to retire from the race a little early, after New York\u2019s victory over Philadelphia meant that no matter what they did at Colorado over the weekend, they were bound to finish fifth. Dominic Kinnear duly rested key players in advance of tonight\u2019s game, and the Dynamo went down to a meaningless 2-0 defeat.</p> <p>Chicago meanwhile, started the weekend in third and hosting second placed DC United, in what was in essence a pre-wild-card game, with high hopes of overtaking them on the last day. They took a lead, relinquished it, and then could not get past Bill Hamid in the DC net, to finish their regular season in fourth and this face tonight\u2019s game.</p> <p>So neither side is exactly enjoying a surge of momentum coming into this one, though on the plus side, the winner of tonight\u2019s game will get a decent bounce going in to face Sporting Kansas City in the Eastern Conference semi-final. I\u2019m not going to be so foolish as to try to call it, but we have taken the liberty of preparing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/30/mls-cup-previews-2012\">a complete playoff preview for your edification</a>, and we have also canvassed the opinion of some of our regular game previewers for these teams, in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/31/mls-cup-2012-wild-card-fan-previews\">a special wild-card edition of our fan previews</a>.</p> <p>Have a read of those, and using your new found knowledge of gut feelings in Illinois and Texas, send me your own thoughts on tonight\u2019s game to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KidWeil\">@KidWeil</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com\">graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com</a> and I\u2019ll be back shortly with more build up and team news.</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>On the face of it, there are plenty of reasons why someone in Roberto Mancini's position \u2013 ambitious, driven, with a love of the good life \u2013 might be attracted to the beautiful scenery along the C\u00f4te d'Azur, the climate, the yacht-choked port and, naturally, all the tax perks that go with living in Monaco.</p> <p>Thanks to the immense wealth of Dmitry Rybolovlev, there is also good reason to believe it will not be too long before AS Monaco's upward trajectory brings the success the Russian billionaire craves, with the kind of financial backing that demands to be taken seriously.</p> <p>Rybolovlev, for those not familiar with the name, made his fortune out of fertiliser, selling his stake in Uralkali for \u00a34.1bn in June 2012 and now comes in at 100th in the Forbes rich-list.</p> <p>As well as a mansion in Monaco and a sleek 165-footer on the water, you can probably get an accurate measure of the man by the fact he has paid \u00a362m to buy Maison de L'Amiti\u00e9, Donald Trump's old pad in Florida, with its 18 bedrooms and private beach. Add in the apartment overlooking Central Park \u2013 at \u00a355m the most expensive in New York \u2013 and it is fair to say the Rybolovlev family has not done too badly.</p> <p>But then you remember Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan and the rest of the Abu Dhabi United Group are not exactly doing too shabbily either, and it makes you wonder what, specifically, should make the Italian negotiate with Monaco last season about becoming their new manager. Was he actually serious about severing his ties with City? Or was it because he suspected they might dispose of him if he failed to win them the league?</p> <p>Monaco's firm belief is that he fancied joining the Rybolovlev revolution come what may. More likely, however, is that his dalliance with the Ligue 2 club, over the course of three months of secret negotiations, was Mancini making contingency plans in case City's owners decided to let him go. Streetwise and political, Mancini knows acutely well how his business works.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/01/manchester-city-roberto-mancini-monaco\" title=\"\">It is certainly revealing that the meeting, in which Monaco came away thinking they had their man,</a> took place in Rome shortly after the 1-0 defeat against Arsenal that left City eight points behind Manchester United, with only six games to go. After that defeat, Mancini spent a long time discussing the future of Mario Balotelli, who had been sent off in disgrace. In hindsight, it might have been more appropriate to ask the manager about his own position.</p> <p>He would have been justified, too, in having misgivings about the tolerance levels of the club's owners, particularly as City had not made it out of their Champions League group. Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the sheikh's right-hand man and chairman of the club, is not trigger-happy, or unrealistic, and wants to do the right thing by his more valued employees. Yet it is a simple fact of life that billionaire businessmen don't usually have much patience when staff fall short of their job requirements.</p> <p>Mancini, after all, has first-hand experience of this from his time in Serie A, when he won three titles for Internazionale but still found himself ushered towards the door \u2013 Operation Mourinho, it was known as \u2013 because he was unable to get them past the Champions League quarter-finals. He had tried to engineer his own departure from the San Siro, following up a defeat against Liverpool in 2008 by announcing it would be his final season.</p> <p>Massimo Moratti, the owner, talked him out of it, then decided to move him on anyway. At this level, as Mancini knows only too well, management can be a cut-throat business.</p> <p>After that Arsenal defeat, the word was that Mancini's future was potentially vulnerable again, effectively hinging on how the final six games of the season went. The message was clear: if they tailed off and finished even further behind United, a change in manager had to be considered an option.</p> <p>What nobody knew at the time was that United would lose at Wigan Athletic, draw 4-4 with Everton after leading 4-2, lose again at City and that, ultimately, it would be blue and white adorning the open-top bus that inched its way through Manchester the following week, rather than red and white. Around March and April, though, it would have been perfectly normal if a little insecurity had crept into Mancini's mind. The suspicion has to be that he recognised the dangers in advance.</p> <p>Monaco might seem a strange choice, not even playing in the top tier of French football at the moment. On the other hand, there is obvious potential for the club to progress under their new owner. Living in Monaco would have appealed to a man of Mancini's tastes. He does not dislike Manchester or the climate of northern England in the way that, say, Carlos Tevez does. Then again, he does not particularly like it, either.</p> <p>Equally, Mancini must know that leaving City for all but maybe three or four other clubs these days would represent a step down. Their difficulties acclimatising to the Champions League have become a considerable disappointment, to say the least, but there is still an enormous amount going for the club, and a sense that they are only in the early stages of the Abu Dhabi master plan.</p> <p>Mancini can often give the impression he is dissatisfied with the work of people above him, arguing that he should be given more power in transfer business and deserves, in short, the same level of control that Sir Alex Ferguson holds at Manchester United. Yet it is quite common for managers to have differences of opinions with administrators, as Mancini has had with Brian Marwood and, previously, Garry Cook.</p> <p>Mancini has always made it his business to have a direct line into the club's owners \u2013 the real decision-makers \u2013 in a way that his predecessor, Mark Hughes, never did. What they did not realise was that, as City and United went head to head for the league title last season, he was simultaneously contemplating joining Monaco.</p>",

We will elect the important national leaders at this meeting. It is very significant: many people's hopes and expectations are attached to it,\" said Wu, party secretary of Huaxi \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/06/huaxi-village-tower-china\" title=\"\">China's richest village</a>\" \u2013 and one of 2,270 delegates who will gather in Beijing for the 18th party congress on 8 November.</p> <p>\"I think people in other countries will care about the congress, just as we care about the presidential election in the United States,\" he added.</p> <p>That may be optimistic, but China's rise means that the handover's reverberations will eventually be felt around the globe.</p> <p>\"Whether you are in the US or UK, what China does matters now,\" said Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago.</p> <p>Two days after the US goes to the polls, the world's second-largest economy \u2013 and a fifth of its population \u2013 will see the beginning of the power shift from Hu Jintao and his peers to younger leaders under Xi Jinping.</p> <p>All but two of the Politburo standing committee, the country's top political body, will step down. About two-thirds of positions in the other key leadership organs and the Central Committee will change hands. Over time, the effects will ripple through the wider party and state systems.</p> <p>To treat the handover as a standalone event is misleading. In the US, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney's neck-and-neck contest will be decided only when polls open. In China, Xi's ascendancy, and Li Keqiang's elevation to replace Premier Wen Jiabao, were signalled at the last party congress in 2007.</p> <p>The gathering in Beijing next week is merely the manifestation of the backstage process that began years ago, when the jockeying for power started, and will run through to next spring - when Xi becomes president - and even further; his authority will in part depend on when Hu Jintao steps down as chairman of the Central Military Commission, for example.</p> <p>In the US, the candidates have laid out dramatically different programmes. In China, where a consensus-driven system stresses continuity, it is impossible to know what Xi stands for, what he plans and what he will be able to achieve.</p> <p>As general secretary, Xi will be first among equals; the composition of the standing committee as a whole, which remains uncertain, will be crucial. And the general course of future policy will be outlined by the congress's political report, hammered out within the party over this year.</p> <p>The biggest contrast, of course, is that despite Wu's words, even China's 82 million Communist party members \u2013 never mind the rest of the 1.4 billion population \u2013 have no real role in choosing their leader.</p> <p>The outside world thinks of Hu foremost as the Chinese president. But he holds that position, and wields his power, because he is general secretary of the party \u2013 China's state system is interlocked with the party structure, but subservient to it.</p> <p>The party congress is at the heart of a procedural facade that presents the handover as the result of an series of bottom-up decisions. In reality, Xi has been chosen by the current leadership, with input from party elders and others.</p> <p>\"The political struggles and the negotiations before and after the Congress are important \u2013 the meeting [itself] is just going through the formalities,\" said Chen Ziming, an independent political scholar based in Beijing.</p> <p>Delegates like Wu \u2013 \"elite party members with a firm political stand, virtue, fine working style, excellent achievements and comparatively strong capability\", in the words of the state news agency \u2013 represent electoral blocs within the party, such as provinces and state-owned enterprises.</p> <p>They elect the 400 or so members of the central committee, who convene as soon as the congress closes, about a week after it opens, to \"elect\" the politburo standing committee.</p> <p>In reality, they are implementing choices made at the top. All of which raises an obvious question: why bother?</p> <p>\"It is a fake phenomenon to show their power,\" said Jin Zhong, a veteran political analyst based in Hong Kong. Yang suggested that the process \"confers some measure of procedural legitimacy within the Communist party\".</p> <p>And while major decisions are reached in advance, there can be minor upsets. Although candidates for the central committee only just outnumber the available places, people have missed out on the jobs they expected after an unexpected failure to make it through. But Yang also pointed out that holding the congress forces those at the top to reach agreement on the new leadership, even if they may not do so until the eleventh hour.</p> <p>This year has proved a bumpier ride than many expected, and not just thanks to the toppling of the Chongqing party secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bo-xilai\" title=\"\">Bo Xilai</a>, who is under investigation by criminal prosecutors. His wife, Gu Kailai, was convicted of murdering the British businessman Neil Heywood, but even if that scandal had not erupted, Bo's evident ambition and populist campaigning had alarmed many in the party. The organisation brought to power by Mao Zedong has worked for years to institutionalise politics and prevent the rise of another charismatic, destabilising figure.</p> <p>The party elite is all the more nervous because this is the first succession not ordained by the founders of the People's Republic. Deng Xiaoping, then paramount leader , anointed Hu as Jiang Zemin's successor as general secretary, but \u2013 by design \u2013 no one wields that kind of authority within the party these days.</p> <p>\"It is not a smooth transition. It is full of contradictions and struggles and compromises too,\" said Li Weidong, a Beijing-based political commentator and former magazine editor. Some believe that even now there is disagreement over who will join the standing committee, though others insist a deal has been reached.</p> <p>\"This time, the political struggle is more intensive than the past,\" said Zhang Lifan, a Beijing-based scholar. \"I don't think the political struggles have finished. I think they have just finished the first round. It will last until the National Congress finishes, until the final name list of the standing committee comes out. It is just like they are playing bridge, and bidding.\"</p>",
  "<p>To give graduates and school leavers the golden rules of making it in the music-industry is not easy. There are principles you can follow but it is a chaotic arena where the clich\u00e9 'there are no rules' is true. But that's why it's always been exciting; you can improvise and explore the business and change your plan. If you want to get involved then you should. Plenty of people will tell you not to but don't take no for an answer.</p> <p>Online is a brave new world where music is consumed in many and different ways. If you can marry an understanding of where the business is going with a respect for what's worked in the past then you'll be on the right road.</p> <p>As the record industry changes (shrinks might be a more honest description) different areas cope better than others. Look at who's still smiling. While there's still a lot of money moving around, people are buying fewer CDs and tickets and it's harder for labels and artists to justify investing money in touring. To be safe I'd advise multi-tasking. If you decide to get a job as an AnR, while managing a new artist and DJ-ing at the weekends then you'll have a better chance of paying bills.</p> <p>If you are a creative person with intellectual copyright to protect then get a good lawyer before you do anything else (even if they're expensive). If you want to work in other areas then it may be less important but it never hurts to have someone at the end of the phone. Don't be afraid to ask them questions \u2013 they could be instrumental in finding you a manager, a record deal and creating opportunities.</p> <p>What makes giving advice difficult is that everyone's situations are different. That said I can try to pass on some wisdom that I have picked up from my journey so far. Other things are borrowed from films, authors and Bob Dylan. I will probably digress with #generalbeingagoodpersonstuff but I think that is important in your work life.</p> <p>Here we go, deep breath:</p> <p>Get Involved. Collaborate. Communicate. Prioritise. Embrace criticism. Get the first round in. Generate your own opportunities then exploit them to the fullest. Don't wait for something to happen to you. Be a yes-man. Under promise, over deliver. Get there early. Only leave if the job is done or it's pub o'clock. Make the tea. Don't make bad tea \u2013 people will dislike and distrust you if you make them disgusting tea. Look people in the eye. Be modest. If in doubt do it. Ask forgiveness, not permission. Try, fail, try again, fail better. Nothing is a waste of time; you learnt something. Call your mother.</p> <p>Apologise if you misbehave or let someone down but never apologise for the quality of your work \u2013 let other people criticise it first. If in doubt pick up the phone; emails are not good for building a rapport, you need to meet people. Don't believe 'bar-chat', people will promise you the world with a drink in their hand. Have meetings in hotels, not pubs, and always stay one drink behind. Give people a lift home.</p> <p>Ask the advice of people in and outside your industry. Be polite to everyone \u2013 you don't know who you are talking to or what kind of day they're having. Hold doors open for people. If you have to push the door open, walk through then hold it open \u2013 don't be that guy trying to hold it open while still on the outside. Listen to music made before the invention of computers. Don't mix your drinks.</p> <p>If you went to university, don't worry it wasn't a waste of time. A lot of the academic hoops you had to jump through (deadlines, blagging, skim-reading) are useful in show business. If you didn't go to university don't worry, it would probably have been a waste of time. Don't overly specialise \u2013 multi-task. Don't stop learning just because you've left education. Learn a new instrument or a new language. It will keep you fresh and humble. Find out about the RBMA. Study sound (Metropolis in West London do a great engineering/production programme). Try to learn from someone you admire. Learn to DJ \u2013 DJs are more popular than musicians.</p> <p>Even if you are broke, keep a bottle of bubbly in the fridge and think of something to celebrate. Don't go on a reality TV show. Don't go on a talent show. Don't talk about carbs. Don't ride a bike without gears or brakes. Call your mother. Don't wear clothes with writing on unless you are a catwalk model, remember it's not a fashion show.</p> <p>Try to remember people's names. Go for a walk. Do one thing a day well, rather than five things badly. Choose your battles. Carry a box of matches. Check your drafts (you may not have clicked send on that email that you say you definitely sent). Check your spam for important emails. Go when you can, not when you must. Don't fear anyone; they're probably just as scared of you. A person's behaviour says more about them than their feelings about you. Don't be a hero. Don't place money and possessions over experiences and creativity. Persevere and don't be deterred by anything. You might have to wait a while for your day in the sun.</p> <p>It is all about the journey.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Women have been at the heart of the co-operative movement since its launch over 165 years ago. Despite this, women have yet to gain genuine equality and achieving this is still a long and frustratingly slow process.</p> <p>This was the perhaps surprising central theme that emerged from the Gender Forum that was held at <a href=\"http://www.manchester2012.coop\" title=\"\">Co-ops United</a>.</p> <p>The audience heard that whilst the membership of the <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operative Group</a>, the UK's biggest co-op was over 70% female, women are still under-represented at all levels of the co-op's management and governance structure: women make up just five of the 20 seats on the non-executive board and only two out of the ten seats on the executive board.</p> <p>Plus there has never been female chief executive in the group's 150 year history. Nor is the Co-op Group unique in its lack of women in senior management: out of the UK's top 20 biggest consumer co-ops only one has a female chief executive.</p> <p>\"Yes it's depressing but it's better than it was and we're tackling it head-on,\" said Chris Harries, one of the five non-executive directors of the Co-operative Group.</p> <p>The group is now addressing the issue and has a diversity strategy committee which is demanding action on the issue of gender imbalance as well as that of black and ethnic minority diversity as both groups are under-represented in the Co-op's senior management.</p> <p>Harries added that the Co-op Group has also signed up to the <a href=\"http://www.uk.coop/womenschallenge/womens-home\" title=\"\">Co-operative Women's Challenge 2020</a> that was launched last year with the aim of addressing the under-representation of women in the wider co-operative movement.</p> <p>From the floor, Ruth Rosselson a freelance consultant from Manchester said that she was both disappointed and surprised with the position of women within the governance structure of the Co-op Group.</p> <p>\"Women are much more reticent in putting themselves forward compared to men so I'd like to see mentoring from women who are already on committees for those women who might be interested in standing for election to Co-op Group area boards but who are lacking in confidence.\"</p> <p>The controversial issue of imposing quotas as way of forcing open the boardroom door to more women was hotly debated following a presentation by Agnes Bols\u00f8, associate professor of Sociology at the <a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/\" title=\"\">Norwegian University of Science and Technology</a>.</p> <p>Professor Bols\u00f8 outlined the impact of the law that now requires a 40% quota of women in Norwegian corporate boardroom's.</p> <p>\"Most interesting are the views of women who have already made it within business and who started out as critics of the quota law,\" said Professor Bols\u00f8. \"They now accept the fact that this might have been the only way to bring about real change in creating more opportunities for women in business.\"</p> <p>On a more positive note the forum learned that not all co-ops have an issue with gender inequality.</p> <p>Britta Werner a member of the booming <a href=\"http://unicorn-grocery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Unicorn Grocery</a> worker's co-op in Manchester, described how all 47 workers of 21 women and 26 men are directors of the co-op which operates a flat management system.</p> <p>\"Equality is just not an issue because it's so culturally ingrained within the workplace so we have no need for quotas,\" said Werner.</p> <p>Given the need for the Co-operative Group to show leadership on the sensitive issue of gender equality, they may need to think very carefully before appointing a new chief executive in the coming weeks following the departure of the current boss Peter Marks.</p> <p><em>Simon Birch is reporting from the <a href=\"http://www.manchester2012.coop\">Co-operatives United</a> event in Manchester</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Dissident republicans are believed to have shot dead a Northern Ireland prison officer in a motorway ambush.</p> <p>David Black, who had worked in the Northern Ireland Prison Service for more than 30 years and was nearing retirement, was shot dead on Thursday on the M1 between Lurgan and Portadown in County Armagh.</p> <p>In what has been described as an ambush, Black, from Cookstown, Co Tyrone, was killed after shots were fired into the car as he drove to work at the top-security Maghaberry jail near Lisburn, Co Antrim, which holds several key republican dissident prisoners.</p> <p>There are unconfirmed reports that a gunman leaned out of a passing car and fired an automatic weapon on the prison officer's vehicle in front of early-morning commuters.</p> <p>Security sources and local politicians blamed anti-ceasefire republicans for the murder. The father of two is the first prison officer to be murdered by paramilitaries since 1993. The killing has sparked fears of an upsurge in dissident republican violence across Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Expressing concern about the threat of further terror attacks, Terry Spence, the chairman of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland, warned: \"Prison officers and police officers alike are aware of the deadly threat from dissident terrorists who won't face up to the fact that Northern Ireland has moved on and will not go back to its awful past. We must all be totally vigilant about our personal safety.\"</p> <p>The Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, condemned the incident as \"a cowardly and evil attack\".</p> <p>The Stormont first minister, Peter Robinson, and deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, also condemned the murder. \"At this time, our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved family and we condemn this murder in the strongest possible terms,\" they said in a joint statement.</p> <p>\"There can be no justification for this brutal attack as this man was going about his daily life. People who work for the Prison Service play a crucial role in our community and any attack on them is an attack on all of us.</p> <p>\"Actions like this have no place in society and those who carried out this murder have nothing positive to contribute, and we refuse to let the people behind this attack divert us from building a better and peaceful future for everyone.</p> <p>\"We appeal to anyone with any information on this murder to contact the PSNI [Police Service of Northern Ireland].\"</p> <p>Matt Baggott, the PSNI chief constable, said: \"It was a completely senseless attack. It demonstrated the recklessness and ruthlessness and sheer dangerousness of those who oppose peace and are dedicated to taking us back to those dark days of the past.\"</p> <p>David Ford, Northern Ireland's justice minister, said: \"This is a horrific murder, for which there can be no justification, and it will be rightly condemned by all those across Northern Ireland. At its very core this is a human tragedy. A man has lost his life this morning and a family are grieving the loss of their loved one. My thoughts are also with the wider Prison Service family.\"</p> <p>Paul Girvan, a Democratic Unionist party member of the Northern Ireland assembly, said Black was on his way to begin duty at the Maghaberry, where dissident republicans have been involved in long-running protests against jail conditions.</p> <p>A burnt-out car was later found in the Inglewood area of Lurgan and is being linked to the shooting, the security sources said.</p> <p>The Lurgan-North Armagh area is a base for the Continuity IRA, which killed the first ever member of the PSNI in a terrorist shooting in 2009.</p> <p>The local SDLP assembly member Dolores Kelly said the entire community was very anxious at the return of paramilitary murder to North Armagh.</p> <p>She added: \"This incident is sickening and disturbing, not to mention reminiscent of the worst moments of the last 40 years. The dark forces behind this disgusting murder, which will wreak devastation on the lives of those affected, do not represent the overwhelming majority of people in the north of Ireland and will not achieve anything by taking a life \u2013 any life.\"</p> <p>Jeffrey Donaldson, MP for Lagan Valley, said: \"This is a terrible tragedy. Once again, a small minority are trying to drag us back to the dark days.\"</p> <p>Finlay Spratt, head of the Prison Officers' Association, knew the dead officer. \"I found him to be a very nice fellow to work with,\" he said. \"He always ensured he did his job to the letter. He was a very good officer.\"</p> <p>Spratt criticised the security provisions offered to prison officers since the Troubles ended. \"They have stripped away all the security around prison officers,\" he said. \"They treat us now as if we live in normal society.\"</p> <p>Both the Provisional IRA and the Irish National Liberation Army targeted and killed prison officers during the long disputes in the jails climaxing in the 1981 hunger strike.</p> <p>At present, Maghaberry \u2013 Northern Ireland's maximum security prison on the outskirts of Belfast \u2013 is the focal point for ongoing protests by Continuity IRA and other dissident republican inmates. There is also widespread anger among those republicans opposed to Sinn F\u00e9in's peace strategy about the continued incarceration of the Old Bailey bomber and IRA veteran Marion Price in a prison hospital.</p>",
  "<p>I started watching this five-disc set during a bout of flu. Within 30 seconds of the exhilarating opening sequence \u2013 a frog's-eye journey up the Thames \u2013 I was feeling better. It was summer once again. There can't be many Olympic opening ceremonies you'd watch more than once, but this was my third time round and it was joyous. In fact, I gave it a fourth watch since I didn't realise that you could also view it while listening to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/danny-boyle\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle</a>, the event's overall mastermind, chatting to the writer he worked with, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/29/frank-cottrell-boyce-olympics-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">Frank Cottrell Boyce</a>.</p> <p>Boyle mentions several things that didn't get into the live coverage \u2013 he didn't, for example, have full control of the camerawork, and would have liked more shots of the audience, to underline their involvement. He reckons that, with so much going on, it was impossible to grasp all the allusions, and in any case not everything worked \u2013 for a start, the roof of the inflatable house didn't inflate. To rectify that, the box set supplies a breakdown of the images that were projected on to the house. \"From <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/shakespeare\" title=\"\">Shakespeare</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/07/archive-1982-gregorys-girl-film\" title=\"\">Gregory's Girl</a>,\" notes Boyle. \"That's a wonderful edit \u2013 to go from one to the other via <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/17/mi5-spied-on-charlie-chaplin\" title=\"\">Chaplin</a>.\" Oh, and that now-famous sequence with the Queen and James Bond \u2013 Boyle says Her Maj was a real pro, although she did need two takes.</p> <p>Boyle makes no distinction between pop and posh \u2013 since \"trash\", if it endures, becomes canonical. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney\" title=\"\">Paul McCartney</a>, for one, will love this made-for-posterity version, because <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cCANKXEKtY\" title=\"\">the hitch at the start of Hey Jude (Macca came in at the wrong time, thanks to a technical fault)</a> has been cleaned up. His singing sounds less strangulated, too.</p> <p>The box set is worth having just for the opening ceremony, a great British communal moment, but you do also get quite a lot of sport. About three discs' worth. Sue Barker, treading wistfully through autumn leaves, introduces the action in a lovely beige mac, and with an Olympian level of cliche: \"Come with me, let's relive those days of wonder \u2026\" The BBC packages the drama with aplomb, but it worried me that it didn't use <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXv3yA5k3i4\" title=\"\">its sports editor David Bond's memorable post-race interview with Mark Cavendish, who, before storming off, barked: \"Stop asking stupid questions \u2013 do you know about cycling?\"</a> The glory of the London Games doesn't need extra buffing: we should get the unvarnished story (even, perhaps, McCartney's \"Hey \u2013 Hey \u2013 Jude\").</p> <p>This is a largely frills-free version that condenses the BBC's footage: it's definitely more Barker than Boyle. We are taken dutifully through the events day by day, with an inevitable emphasis on British triumphs, though there is one brilliant illustrated essay by sports commentator Eddie Butler that captures the whole thing in 10 minutes. Only sports nuts \u2013 those people who care so much about hockey and handball that they can watch it accompanied by tinkly music \u2013 will plough through the entire thing, although even they may be exhausted by Hazel Irvine's earnestness. But there is plenty to enjoy: having missed the shooting, I found myself strangely gripped by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSE6d_3rGvg\" title=\"\">Peter Wilson's tearful victory in the double trap</a>.</p> <p>The final disc contains <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/olympic-games-closing-ceremony-culture\" title=\"\">the hit-and-miss closing ceremony</a>: a pop concert in which too many of the stars were dead and had to appear as holograms. The sound quality is better than I recall \u2013 and Muse, Eric Idle, the Spice Girls, Ed Sheeran and the Who are worth seeing again. But there's an awful lot of dross. It would be useful to have some gloss here from Boyle or Butler, or even Barker in beige, but all we have is Irvine's unflagging enthusiasm. She does, however, find the right words at the end: \"This has truly been the time of our lives.\"</p>",

That's right. Major label record company sign band not female singer-songwriter with big belter of a voice shocker! And they're an indie band \u2013 shamelessly so. We can't even remember the last time a major label signed an indie band. We're sure they have, it just doesn't stick in the mind, and the point is, when we found out that Columbia had done the deal with San Cisco, it felt like a bolt-from-the-blue, especially when the clamour right now still seems to be to sign the new Adele/Lana \u2013 or, at a pinch, the new Sheeran.</p> <p>San Cisco, who all attended the same high school in Fremantle, make bright, bubbly indie. It's not herky-jerky math-pop, it's \u2026 indie, with a dash of Afro in the guitars and an ebullience that surely made the band regret that the name Clap Your Hands Say Yeah was already taken. The music is a showcase for boy-girl vocals \u2013 either in unison, doing call and response or singing in harmony \u2013 rhythms apparently acquired from an iPhone app that simulates classic drum machines and lots of old keyboards such as a Fender Rhodes and a Minimoog. Oh, and lots of bright and bubbly choruses, even though most of the songs are about how crap they all are at relationships. \"Your heart's in your mouth, your guts on the ground\" \u2013 that kind of thing. What AC/DC \u2013 whose label they've signed to back home \u2013 will make of their spindly ditties full of jangly guitars and dolorous lyrics is anyone's guess.</p> <p>We can't see AC/DC doing many covers of the songs on their forthcoming Beach EP, although San Cisco have done a cover themselves \u2013 no, not of Highway to Hell, Tame Impala's Solitude Is Bliss. There isn't much digital psychedelia on Beach, just waves of innocent energy supplied by the tried-and-tested guitar-bass-drums and voices that communicate wonder undercut by a sadness that one's teenage years, however fraught, may be the best of our lives. The title track opens with a keyboard chord that is pure Africa by Toto, suggestive of chillwave opulence, but when the song gets going it becomes an indie singalong, albeit one with a kick (\"I made a mixtape with all the songs that you hate\"). Golden Revolver is percussive and danceable in a drunk-down-the-indie-disco way, with another lyric laced with something vaguely approaching venom. At one point they even sing, \"You shot me with your golden revolver\" \u2013 is that sexual, or are they just pleased to see us? Reckless takes a break from all the uplift, being stark and acoustic in a thoroughly ordinary way that will doubtless seem special to anyone who is experiencing the heartbreak alluded to in the lyric. Lover is faster, sprightlier, new wave-punkier, with overtones of the Undertones.</p> <p>Columbia obviously did their homework; they didn't sign San Cisco on a whim. The band's previous single, Awkward, went top 10 in Australia and had 2.5m YouTube views and although another, Rocket Ship, was watched by a mere quarter of a million people the video did feature one man skateboarding in traffic, at night, on a piece of wood and another dressed as a rabbit.

That includes minorities, Christians and the business community, who need to know that there can be a change to something better than the Assad regime.</p> <p>It is, of course, not possible or desirable for people in other countries, including our country, to try to impose on them any particular programme. The whole point is that Syria\u2019s future should be for Syrians to decide, so they have to take the decisive steps to come together with a coherent platform. Our special representative works with them on a daily, usually an hourly, basis, and our pressure on them for the forthcoming meeting is co-ordinated with the United States, France, Turkey and leading Arab nations. It is very clear that the Syrians know that the world is looking to them to come together in a more effective way.</p> <p>I want to pay tribute to many people who risk their lives to support the opposition and to many who have worked in the Syrian National Council, for instance, to set out a clear intention to create a better future for their country, but it is now important that they come together in a more effective way. I have often explained to them that in the history of this country when we have faced an existential threat, all parties have come together on a common programme. Syria now faces an existential threat to any peaceful or stable future; it has to do the same.</p> </blockquote> <p>Former Labour minister Peter Hain urged Hague to back a transitional government in Syria. Hague replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is not that the western world has set out on regime change in Syria, but it is certainly our analysis, and it has been for a long time, that peace cannot be brought to Syria without the departure of President Assad. There is no viable peace; there is no peace that the people of Syria would accept without that. I am not changing tone or policy on that.

  "<p>The invitation to the White House in the spring of 2009 struck Barack Obama's allies in the environmental movement as a big moment: a clear sign that climate change was on his radar and that the president was eager to get to work.</p> <p>The event was indeed a turning point, but not the one campaigners expected. Instead, it marked a strategic decision by the White House to downplay climate change \u2013 avoiding the very word \u2013 a decision some campaigners on the guestlist say produced the strange absence of climate change from the 2012 campaign, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/sandy-climate-change-us-election\" title=\"\">until hurricane Sandy blew it right back on the political agenda</a>.</p> <p>The storm \u2013 which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/obama-sandy-aftermath-campaign?utm_term=%23SGS&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" title=\"\">interrupted campaigning for three of the last eight days of the presidential race</a> \u2013 may even prove the decisive factor in the elections, with voters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/new-jersey-christie-obama-response-sandy\" title=\"\">watching how Obama handles Sandy's aftermath</a>. The devastation has already sparked debate about America's present-day vulnerability to climate change.</p> <p>But back in 2009, the off-the-record event with the White House green team at the old executive office building offered the first chance for the White House to share its plans for getting a climate change law through Congress. Aides handed round a one-page memo of polling data and talking points.</p> <p>\"It was in the context of the financial collapse. With everyone struggling, how do we connect with the public and build political support when everyone's mind was on the very scary economy,\" said <a href=\"http://breakthroughstrategiesandsolutions.com/About_Us.html\" title=\"\">Betsy Taylor, president of Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions</a> an organisation that works with philanthropic and non-profit clients, who attended the meeting.</p> <p>The answer was clear: climate change was not a winning message. Raising the topic would also leave Obama open to attack from industry and conservative groups opposed to intervention in the economy.</p> <p>\"What was communicated in the presentation was: 'This is what you talk about, and don't talk about climate change'.\" Taylor said. \"I took away an absolutely clear understanding that we should focus on clean energy jobs and the potential of a clean energy economy rather than the threat of climate change.\"</p> <p>The message stuck. Subsequent campaigns from the Obama administration and some environmental groups relegated climate change to a second-tier concern. After industry and conservative groups mobilised to attack Obama's policies and climate science in the summer of 2009, the topic was seen as an even greater liability and politically toxic.</p> <p>There was no mention of climate change during six hours of televised debate. Moderators failed to bring up the question, and Obama and Mitt Romney made no effort to fill in the gaps \u2013 even during a long and heated exchange about offshore drilling and coal.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/29/ann-romney-chris-christie-address-video\" title=\"\">Romney's convention speech</a> reduced climate change to a laughline. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate\" title=\"\">Obama defended climate science at the Democratic convention</a>, and he answered a question on climate in an MTV interview last month.</p> <p>Otherwise, Obama mentioned climate only in passing and in front of safe or rock-solid Democratic audiences, such as fundraisers in San Francisco and New York or events on college campuses. Since Sandy's devastating storm, a number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/sandy-climate-change-us-election\" title=\"\">prominent Democrats like Bill Clinton and Al Gore have talked about climate change</a>, and taken Romney to task on the issue.</p> <p>Those gathered on 26 March 2009 to hear from key members of Obama's green dream team \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/25/carol-browner-obama-climate-advisor-departs-white-house\" title=\"\">Carol Browner, then energy and climate adviser</a>, Nancy Sutley, chair of the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq\" title=\"\">Council on Environmental Quality</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/07/van-jones-resignation\" title=\"\">Van Jones, then green jobs adviser</a>, believed it would be a pivotal year.</p> <p>The White House and both houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats, world leaders were due to gather in Copenhagen in December to finalise a global climate change treaty.</p> <p>But the economy was in meltdown. The White House, after studying polling and focus groups, concluded it was best to frame climate change as an economic opportunity, a chance for job creation and economic growth, rather than an urgent environmental problem.</p> <p>\"My most vivid memory of that meeting is this idea that you can't talk about climate change,\" said Jessy Tolkan, who at the time was a leader of the climate youth movement, Power Shift. \"The real sense at that time was that talking about clean energy jobs, green jobs, was the way we were going to be able to gain momentum and usher in real change. Talking about climate change and global warming was not going to resonate as much.\"</p> <p>None of the principal White House officials would talk on the record about the meeting. The White House did not release materials related to the meeting or respond to a request for visitors' records.</p> <p>But most of the environmental groups were inclined to go along. \"When the White House invites you to a meeting and says: 'here is how we are going to talk about these things', it sends a very clear message,\" said <a href=\"http://www.foe.org/about-us/our-team/our-president\" title=\"\">Erich Pica, president of the US Friends of the Earth Action</a>, who was also at the meeting.</p> <p>Now with Obama fighting for re-election, and the climate agenda stalled and under constant attack from Republicans and industry, environmental groups acknowledge the go-softly strategy was a mistake.</p> <p>\"I thought it was a mistake and I told them,\" said Bill McKibben, who heads the <a href=\"http://350.org/\" title=\"\">350.org</a> group, who was one of the few people at the meeting to voice his misgivings. \"All I said was sooner or later you are going to have to talk about this in terms of climate change. Because if you want people to make the big changes that are required by the science then you are going to have to explain to people why that is necessary, and why it's such a huge problem,\" he said.</p> <p>The stealth approach also gave the opposition an opening. The White House reluctance to even mention climate change allowed some in industry and on the right of the political spectrum to discredit climate science.</p> <p>Others argue the strategy of downplaying climate change was a politically necessity. It was na\u00efve to expect to get ambitious measures through Congress in a debate clogged up with scientific detail.</p> <p>\"I don't think it was a mistake,\" said Steve Cochran. vice-president of climate and air at the <a href=\"http://www.edf.org/\" title=\"\">Environmental Defence Fund</a>. \"The people that supported climate were already with us. The people who had questions needed arguments beyond climate, which led to more and more focus on arguments beyond climate.\"</p> <p>Campaign groups agree Obama continued to push the climate agenda, even if he did so below the radar, through the Environmental Protection Agency regulations and other branches of the government.</p> <p>The economic recovery plan included some $90bn for green-ish measures, such as high speed rail and public transport, and weather-proofing low-income homes.</p> <p>Obama also publicly embraced some environmental measures, standing out in front when the administration proposed raising car mileage standards in May 2009. But the president left climate change out of his Earth Day event, and was a no-show in June 2009 at the release of a landmark scientific report on how America's cities and coastlines would be affected by climate change. There was no mention of climate change in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/25/state-of-union-2012-environment\" title=\"\">2012 state of the union address</a>.</p> <p>Environmental groups, taking their cue from the White House, also downplayed climate. The coalition pushing for climate change law in Congress called itself Clean Energy Works. The bill itself was called the American Clean Energy and Security Act. Campaign groups ran ads featuring former steel workers in green helmets talking about the well-paying new jobs building wind turbines.</p> <p>\"If you look at the messaging being done during the climate legislation, it was mostly not about climate,\" said Carl Pope, who was then the executive director of the Sierra Club. \"They realised it was going to be a big target as soon as it passed the house.\"</p> <p>And it nearly didn't pass. The house of representatives' vote on the climate bill was uncomfortably close, 219-212, with only eight Republicans supporting and 44 Democrats opposed, and it set off a furious backlash.</p> <p>The oil and gas industry alone spent $175m in 2009 trying to block climate legislation, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2010/08/pro-environment-groups-were-outmatc.html\" title=\"\">according Open Secrets</a>, which tracks money in politics. The conservative Tea Party movement turned opposition to climate legislation, even climate science, into an article of faith.</p> <p>In the summer of 2010, the US senate dropped the bill, with then Democrat Senate majority leader Harry Reid admitting: \"We know we don't have the votes.\"</p> <p>The administration and environmental groups talked about climate change even less, said Pica, and when they did the connections were even less clear.</p> <p>Facing public confusion about the green jobs promised by Obama's recovery plan, and scepticism about his promise to build a clean energy economy, administration officials switched to talking about climate through healthcare or even national security. They recruited Iraq war veterans to talk about wind energy.</p> <p>\"There was a really big emphasis on talking about what I call the sub-narratives \u2013 that there were other ways to speak about the opportunity and the challenge of climate change rather than calling it that,\" said <a href=\"http://climaterealityproject.org/our-ceo/\" title=\"\">Maggie Fox, the chief executive of Al Gore's Climate Reality Project</a>. \"There was a whole suite of sub-narratives: national security, clean energy future, diversification of energy, health, future generations \u2026 \"</p> <p>But Fox acknowledges none of those reasons \u2013 although compelling \u2013 went far enough in justifying the need for sweeping transformation needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. \"Over time it became in effect an absence of conversation about climate change as a threat, and I think in the end that proved to be unwise because it is the one reason all these storylines matter.\"</p> <p>The problem now, say campaign groups, is that it has become even more difficult for politicians to talk about climate change, even when evidence is all around them in extreme weather events and even when there is growing public concern about climate change. <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/climate/files/Climate-Beliefs-September-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">A Yale University study last month found 70% of Americans now believe in the reality of climate change</a>, a sharp rise over the last two years. The administration, the campaigners say, missed an educational opportunity.</p> <p>Obama, in debates and in campaign stops, continued to talk up the importance of investing in America's future through building a clean energy economy. But the connection to the threat of climate change was lost.</p> <p>\"It's really hard to sell clean energy. Clean energy is really struggling because the story has gotten garbled,\" said Larry Schweiger, president of the <a href=\"http://www.nwf.org/\" title=\"\">National Wildlife Federation</a>. \"You can't have a clear conversation, and the reason there can't be a clear conversation is because of this elephant in the room which is climate change.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's something almost nostalgic about <a href=\"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-GB/Product/Halo-4/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8024d530919/?cid=ps-g-amca-xboxhalo4uk-halo+4-g_uk_e_238947hj23984123490230h142346210\" title=\"\"><strong>Halo 4</strong></a> (Xbox 360). It is 11 years since the galaxy-trotting saga began with the defining flagship title of the original Xbox, Halo: Combat Evolved, and since then, true to its name, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/nov/14/halo-combat-evolved-anniversary-review\" title=\"\">franchise has progressed at a Darwinian pace</a>.</p> <p>It's not that nothing has ever been added. Quite the opposite: new guns, vehicles, aliens and allies have all leapt into the fray with each new release. Halo 2 was the first to let players dual-wield rifles, and it wasn't until Halo 3 that players locked horns with hulking, four-legged walking tanks. But it's in no way a criticism to say that, at core, the experience of playing a Halo game is, like the shark, almost entirely unevolved since that first perfect killer.</p> <p>Much of Halo 4's multiplayer mode \u2013 or \"Infinity mode\", as it has been inexplicably rechristened \u2013 will be fondly familiar to past players. There's the usual broad range of maps, mixing sprawling vehicle-laden badlands with hovering, hi-tech fortresses full of air-lifts, balconies and sheer drops, and the usual array of weapons, including energy swords and sniper rifles, plus a couple of funky new additions. And while there are new vehicles in the campaign, Infinity focuses on the classics: the Warthog buggy, the alien hover-bike, the Ghost and a quaintly useless unarmed quad bike, the Mongoose.</p> <p>The most notable change is a new focus on unlockables. Previous titles featured levels and ranks, but kept them out of the combat experience itself. No longer. In Halo 4, players gain levels \u2013 or Spartan Ranks \u2013 that allow them to unlock new starting weapons load-outs, switching, for example, their battle rifle for an assault rifle, or their frag grenades for plasmas. It's the same system employed in most other modern first-person shooters, but in a Halo game, where the best weapons are drastically more powerful than the worst, there's a risk it will feel a little unfair. You know, on the n00bs.</p> <p>There is also a risk that the introduction of kill-streak rewards will prove demoralising for lesser players. Those who manage to rack up a chain of kills can now have weapons and power-ups delivered right to their feet, making it harder than ever to overturn a deficit, and easier for a single elite player to run riot. Of course, it's always fun if that elite player happens to be you. But less so if you're the guy he's one-shot killed the last 10 times.</p> <p>The playing field may be less level, but the sport has hardly changed. You'll still find yourself scrambling, at the start of each game, to get hold of the best guns and vehicles, or else spend much of the rest of it being killed by better-armed opponents. Likewise, when you come face-to-face with the other team, jumping will still be your best friend, and shooting someone leaping directly over you remains one of the game's core skills, as does running directly at the other guy and braining them with a well-timed rifle slap.</p> <p>Spartan Ops \u2013 the game's co-operative missions \u2013 promise something a bit different. Released in seasons of 50 missions, five a week for 10 weeks, they come with accompanying introductory cinematics supplementing the main story, and can be played alone or alongside up to three allies over Xbox Live. Coupled with a full offline campaign, there's clearly plenty here for gamers who prefer to avoid the cut, thrust and frequent tea-bagging of player-versus-player. (If you don't know, don't look it up.)</p> <p>The campaign itself sees original hero Master Chief awake after four years cryo-sleep to an alien assault, and begins in archetypal Halo fashion. Minutes in, trusty AI sidekick Cortana is barking at our hero to reach an air-lock before the ship they are on explodes. Soon after, panicked alien grunts are scurrying away like quacking, punch-drunk toddlers, and soon after that the Chief is racing across the surface of an unknown planet in a handy buggy. The graphics are better, the cut-scenes stunning, but the game itself looks like Halo as usual.</p> <p>I have not had enough time with the game to encounter the freaky robot dogs, clanking necro-droids and other new evils that I know from trailers the campaign has in store, but it's unlikely their arrival will send the game veering off in a whole new direction. This looks like a sequel fiercely loyal to its predecessors, with enough courage to add a few new tricks, and enough sense not to tinker with the bits that ain't broke. If it's Halo as usual, that's no bad thing at all.</p>",
  "<p>On October 15, 2003, a dental assistant named Vicki Bowen was shot dead by her boyfriend at the home they shared in Polk county, about a 90-minute drive north-east of Houston.<br> In his confession, Donnie Roberts, a 32-year-old laborer, told police that he had a crack cocaine problem and would go to bars, get drunk and look for drugs. According to the police report, he said: \"I pointed the gun at her and I said: 'if you'd just give me some money'. And she said 'No'. And then I said: 'look, it doesn't have to be this way'. That's all I remember saying to her. And the next thing I know, I shot her.\" At trial, Roberts changed his story and testified that he fired at Bowen because he thought she was going to shoot him with a pistol. Exactly a year after the crime, a jury found him guilty of capital murder and later sentenced him to death. Bowen's was one of 1,422 murders in Texas in 2003. Nine years on, it will gain a certain degree of notoriety as a symbol of Rick Perry's continued enthusiasm for punishing murder with death. Roberts was executed on Wednesday night, becoming the 250th Texas prisoner to be put to death under Perry's watch. Texas has executed more people in nearly 12 years under Perry than it did in the previous 24 years. Death Penalty Information Center statistics show that by the last week in October, 1,310 people have been executed in the US since the supreme court reinstated capital punishment in 1976. Of those, 488 \u2013 about 37% \u2013 were executed in Texas. This is more than the total of the next six most prolific states combined. Another four are scheduled to die between November 8 and December 12. Perry has presided over far more executions than any other governor in modern US history, though the rate was higher under his predecessor and previous record-setter. George W Bush oversaw 152 deaths between 1995 and 2000. The numbers can be partly explained by the length of Perry's tenure in the US's second-most populous state, as well as Texas's relatively fast and streamlined process for conveying the guilty from courtroom to gurney.</p> <h2>The governor's powers</h2> <p>Texas law limits a governor's powers regarding death sentences, which are handed down by local juries. But the governor appoints the members of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and can make non-binding requests for them to make a certain ruling. He can also reject the board's clemency recommendations, as he did in 2009 in the case of Robert Thompson, who went to the death chamber under a state law that holds accomplices equally responsible for murder as those who actually commit the killing. The shooter, meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.txexecutions.org/reports/446.asp\">received life in prison</a>. <br> As a last resort a governor can stop an execution via a 30-day stay, which in practice might delay proceedings for longer. Perry has used this reprieve only once. He has granted 31 death row commutations, 28 of them owing to a 2005 supreme court decision prohibiting the execution of minors; none since 2007. Perry thinks capital punishment is quintessentially Texan. In his 2010 book, Fed Up!, Perry writes: \"If you don't support the death penalty and citizens packing a pistol, don't come to Texas.\" Perry said at the Republican presidential candidates' debate in September last year that he had \"never struggled [to sleep at night] at all\" with the idea that someone executed under his watch might have been innocent. \"In the state of Texas, if you come into our state and you kill one of our children, you kill a police officer, you're involved with another crime and you kill one of our citizens, you will face the ultimate justice in the state of Texas, and that is, you will be executed,\" Perry said. The audience cheered. \"That certainly projected an image of Texas that doesn't reflect the reality,\" Kristin Houl\u00e9, executive director of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, told the Guardian. \"Texas is moving away from the death penalty. The climate has really shifted on this issue. It's time our elected officials caught up.\" A University of Texas/Texas Tribune survey last May found that 73% of Texan voters polled were either somewhat or strongly in support of the death penalty. But only 51% said it was fairly applied in Texas, with 28% disagreeing. And when offered an alternative of life in prison without parole, support dropped to 53% in favor of capital punishment and 37% preferring imprisonment. A Gallup poll last year found 61% of Americans in favor of the death penalty for murderers, the lowest approval rating in their study since 1972. California has the most prisoners on death row of any state but has not held an execution since 2006. Voters there will decide next month whether to abolish the death penalty. Perry's grandstanding masks a decline in executions under his watch. There were 13 last year, the fewest since 1996 and down from a high of 40 in 2000, Bush's last year as governor. Some 20 inmates arrived on death row in 2002, compared with six so far this year. In 2001, Perry vetoed a bill banning the execution of what are termed \"mentally retarded\" inmates. But in 2005 he signed a bill giving juries in capital murder cases the option to give defendants life without parole, which Houl\u00e9 argues has significantly reduced the number of death sentences. She believes that the execution rate will continue to decline after the backlog of inmates from past decades clears. There are about 285 offenders presently on Texas death row \u2013 six of them since the 1970s. Josh Havens, a Perry spokesman, told the Guardian via email that longevity explains his status as the \"killingest\" governor. \"Simply put, he is the longest serving governor in Texas history. It should be noted, though, that the number of annual executions has not increased during governor Perry's tenure,\" Havens said.</p> <p>\"Jeff Blackburn, of the Texas Innocence Project [a group that aims to exonerate the wrongly convicted], routinely praises governor Perry for having made the most significant improvements to the criminal justice system of any other Texas governor \u2026 the governor personally reviews each and every death penalty case.\"</p> <p>However, numerous high-profile cases have drawn attention to Perry's refusal to stop controversial executions. Last year, Texas ignored a White House request to halt the death of the Mexican national Humberto Leal on the basis that it could have negative international repercussions for the US.<br> Cameron Todd Willingham was executed in 2004 for allegedly setting fire to his home in order to kill his three children in 1991. Shortly before his death, Perry was sent a report by an arson expert casting serious doubt on the evidence but refused to grant a stay. Subsequent investigations by reporters and advocacy groups have provided compelling reasons to believe that Willingham was innocent. His relatives are now <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/24/cameron-todd-willingham-posthumous-pardon_n_2010673.html\">seeking a posthumous pardon</a>.<br> In 2005, Texas created a state commission to regulate the use of forensic science in criminal trials. Perry replaced the chairman in 2009 and three others when the agency was in the midst of examining the Willingham case, leading to accusations that the governor was trying to halt the investigation. Marvin Wilson died by lethal injection in August this year despite having an IQ of 61 and being medically diagnosed as \"mentally retarded\". A 2002 supreme court ruling bans the execution of these prisoners but Texas <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/texas-death-row-mentally-retarded\">applies its own definition of mental disability</a> inspired partly by the character Lennie from the John Steinbeck novel, Of Mice And Men. <br> On October 18, the supreme court stopped the execution of Anthony Haynes less than three hours before the 33-year-old was to go to the death chamber for the murder of an off-duty Houston police officer 14 years ago. Haynes' attorneys claimed that his trial lawyers were negligent, that prosecutors inaccurately depicted his character and that Texas appeals procedures were unfair. </p> <h2>'The conditions have to be more humane'</h2> <p>Anthony Graves endured 18 years in prison in Texas \u2013 12 on death row \u2013 for his alleged role in multiple murders. He spent much of that time in solitary confinement. He was released aged 45 in 2010 after a special prosecutor investigated the case and concluded that Graves was innocent \u2013 a decade after the other man convicted in the affair, Robert Carter, confessed that he was the lone killer. Carter was executed in 2000.<br> According to the Death Penalty Information Center, Graves is one of 12 death row inmates exonerated in Texas, five during Perry's governorship. \"I most definitely think [capital punishment] should be abolished for the simple fact that we can just never be sure we get it right. We don't have the authority to be playing a guessing game with someone's life,\" Graves told the Guardian. He is now an anti-capital punishment activist in Texas. \"Death row was an experience an ordinary person can never understand. It was just like taking a man and putting him on Mars. The total lack of human respect for another individual was a shock to me,\" he said. \"The conditions have to be more humane. You don't understand how enormous just a touch is in your life till they take it away from you.\" Graves believes that Texas' legal processes are undermined by errors and misconduct. \"I still think that we overall have a really good system. I wouldn't so much criticize the system, as those who were entrusted with it,\" he said. <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/texas-dept-criminal-justice/texas-court-of-criminal-appeals/courts-found-prosecutors-erred-25-exonerations/\">A Texas Tribune analysis of overturned convictions</a> found that mistakes by prosecutors potentially contributed to the wrong outcome in almost a quarter of cases.<br> Perry told reporters last year that the discovery of mistakes in the Graves case proves that the system works. \"You continue to find errors that were made and clear them up,\" he said. \"The governor made sure I was compensated so I don't have anything negative to say about him. The blame we have to place at the voters' feet,\" Graves said. \"You've got to point the finger at those who support the death penalty. The blood is on the hands of them, not just Rick Perry.\" He doubts attitudes towards the death penalty are going to change: after all, this is Texas. \"The culture here is old western-style,\" Graves said. \"Guns on the hip, shoot you down before you get the chance to ask questions.\"</p>",

The gameplay involves plenty of dungeons and monsters, while the visuals are pixel-art-tastic.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.legendsofloot.com/\">Legends of Loot</a> (Free)</h2> <p>More dungeons here: a dungeon-crawler game with mazes, monsters and traps galore \u2013&nbsp;more than 100 levels to play through, with a clever combat system and the ability to keep up with your friends' achievements when they're playing, through an in-game calendar.<br><strong>Android / iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/halo-4-king-hill-fuled-by/id565679301?mt=8\">Halo 4: King of the Hill Fueled by Mountain Dew</a> (Free)</h2> <p>The title may make hardcore Halo fans cry, but this is more than just a branded tie-in. Yes, there are brands involved: the gameplay includes scanning Mountain Dew and Doritos products, as well as hanging around 7-Eleven shops. But there are some interesting location-based ideas going on here too, in terms of taking the world of Halo into, well, the real world.

However, there's more here: rockets, magnets and other power-ups, for example, as well as a variety of tracks to race through. It's the work of innovative developer RedLynx (of Trials fame) and publisher Ubisoft, which is a partnership worth watching.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/big-buck-hunter-pro/b9ac0e9f-d9bf-4a3b-82e4-283aa8e5ef90\">Big Buck Hunter Pro</a> (\u00a32.29)</h2> <p>Big Buck Hunter will pass most Brits by, since we don't spend much time hunkered down in forests trying to shoot \"whitetail bucks\".

It sees you blasting your way through 24 levels in a tank, upgrading its weapons as you go, with neat top-down graphics giving you a bird's eye view of the action.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/monster-warlord/id553060813?mt=8\">Monster Warlord</a> (Free)</h2> <p>This is the latest freemium card-battler game, which as the title implies involves all manner of monsters. There are hundreds of beasts to collect and combine, with a clan system to spice up the online multiplayer elements. It's a port from the existing Android version.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftZOHM\">Zombiewood</a> (Free)</h2> <p>There are more zombies to be diced, sliced, shot and generally treated with abject impoliteness in Gameloft's Zombiewood, which is set in Los Angeles (hence the name). Its Android version follows hot on the heels of the action-packed iOS version, taking the form of a dual-stick shooter. The sticks, of course, are virtual.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/collapse!-blast/id518119428?mt=8\">Collapse! Blast</a> (Free)</h2> <p>GameHouse's Collapse games might not be quite as big as Bejeweled, but they're still one of the most enduring and popular match-three puzzle franchises. This is based on the latest incarnation on Facebook, as you bust coloured blocks and compete against friends.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/totem-runner/id541710977?mt=8\">Totem Runner</a> (\u00a30.69)</h2> <p>Dragons, rampaging rhinos, mighty eagles and \"malevolent darkness\". A good night out in Bishop's Stortford, yes, but also the key features of Chillingo's horror game. It sees you running, fighting, and transforming into the different beasts, accompanied by striking visuals.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobage.ww.a1098.monster_mall_Android\">Monster Mall</a> (Free)</h2> <p>\"Ever thought about managing your own shopping center?\" asks the Google Play Store listing for Mobage's new strategy game, optimistically given the existence of several very-popular managing-your-own-shopping-centre games on mobile. The twist here is in the name: the customers are monsters. It's a Halloweeny take on the shopping/tower genre, with social features like visiting friends' key to the action.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/big-fish-casino-uk-free-real/id551834622?mt=8\">Big Fish Casino UK</a> (Free)</h2> <p>Big Fish Casino has been making headlines this week, as it's one of the first examples of a casual games publisher (Big Fish Games) moving into real-money gambling. Here, that means a virtual slot machine game called Year Of The Dragon, where you can bet and win real cash. However, if that's a bit edgy for you, there are play-for-fun games here too.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ayopagames.museandroid&amp;hl=en\">M.U.S.E.</a> (\u00a31.23)</h2> <p>Nothing to do with the band: this blends elements of roleplaying games with a third-person shooter, with lots of action, a \"badass agent\" hero, and waves upon waves of cyborgs to shoot your way through.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hungry-shark-evolution/id535500008?mt=8\">Hungry Shark: Evolution</a> (\u00a30.69)</h2> <p>There is an official Jaws mobile game, but it seems to have proved much less popular than Hungry Shark from Future Games of London. Now it's got a sequel, although sadly that title doesn't mean your shark is sprouting legs and rampaging round seaside resorts. Although that gives me an idea for a film... Here you're playing a Great White Shark, completing undersea missions and growing as you chomp through creatures and humans.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.offtheleash\">Off the Leash</a> (\u00a30.69)</h2> <p>Miniclip is famous for its web games, but it's making a move into mobile too. Off the Leash sees you playing a dog, trying to outrun the police after a ban on all things canines is introduced, while rescuing your four-legged friends. One twist being that you get to play different dogs, starting as a Golden Retriever before unlocking others. It's colourful and very fun.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.blitzoo.slotspot\">SlotSpot</a> (Free)</h2> <p>More slot machines here, but play-for-fun ones. The game is based on developer Blitzoo Games' Facebook title, as you play through a series of levels and machines.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/nba-king-of-the-court-2/id545373974?mt=8\">NBA: King of the Court 2</a> (\u00a31.49)</h2> <p>The second location-based game from Ogmento this week, sitting alongside the Halo 4 game. NBA: King of the Court 2 is a sequel, seeing you shooting virtual hoops, while battling with other players in your real-life location for king-of-the-court status. There's a solo mode for practising, too.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.boomlings\">Boomlings</a> (Free)</h2> <p>For all the whizzy 3D console-style games coming to modern smartphones and tablets, traditional puzzlers are still one of the most popular genres. Boomlings might not be a famous name like Bejeweled or Collapse, but it deserves attention, with cute characters to match, lots of power-ups, and online challenges and Facebook leaderboards to compare your skills with friends.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <p>That's our selection, but what are you playing this week on your smartphone or tablet?

Some go further: Labour MP Graham Allen, who chairs the Commons political and constitutional reform committee, argues forcefully for a new \"partnership of equals\" between central and local government and is supporting the Local Government Association's campaign for independent local government.

  "<p>\"Amazing\", \"wonderful\", \"wow\", \"great result\", \"incredible\". It's hard to imagine any housing job attracting such superlatives, but that's how my normally sober friends from the now defunct Audit Commission reacted to my new posting as housing executive for the south Atlantic island of St Helena. And apart from astronaut or rock star, I can't imagine any job deserving it.</p> <p>Mind you, not all comments were so effusive: \"sounds really interesting if that's what you want\" was typical of well-meaning friends who don't share my enthusiasm for housing and travel. Others enjoyed the irony of me having turned down a housing policy manager post in London because I didn't want to commute, only to end up in one of the remotest places on the planet \u2013 five days by boat from Cape Town or three days from Ascension Island, if you can get there.</p> <p>Discovered by the Portuguese and settled by the East India Company and freed slaves, St Helena is a volcanic island with a population of 4,255 and located more than 1,200 miles (1,931km) from south west coast of Africa. The island's economy has been on a downward trajectory since the growth of air travel. The loss of trade has been matched only by the exodus of young people seeking work and a living wage.</p> <p>This is now set to change: a huge airport investment, a five-star hotel and the unique attractions of the island look set to reverse the trend. St Helena is a microcosm of Costa Rica, with its 400 native species, incredible geography and with its capital city's high street made up of listed Georgian buildings. It's being shortlisted for world heritage status \u2013 just so long as there are homes for the hundreds of people who will now be attracted to stay and return to the island. This is where I come in.</p> <p>As housing executive I have responsibility for improving the existing housing stock, developing new homes and even new communities. The most exciting part of the job is that there is a blank sheet of paper when it comes to housing legislation and housing management. St Helena has had very little of either.</p> <p>This is not, thank goodness, about imposing UK practices on the island. It's pretty clear to everyone that the UK model has failed: we've failed to develop the number of homes we need, the planning system continues to move at the pace of a supertanker and localism places even more weight in favour of the haves over the have nots. The result is that house prices are way beyond the means of all but a few first-time buyers, homelessness is rising fast and the housing benefit bill is going through the roof.</p> <p>There really could be an alternative. It's all about land use since that affects land prices and, in turn, housing costs. Shielding housing prices from the ravages of inflation is the way to make housing affordable for local people in perpetuity.</p> <p>At the same time, international investment and luxury homes are essential for future development. We have an opportunity to get the right balance between social rents, incomes and the benefits system.</p> <p>Unfortunately the UK agenda appears to be to force up social rents so high that nobody earning a half decent income will want to rent, to privatise the housing associations now that they are earning huge surpluses and to continue to reduce benefits to such a level that anyone who can't get a job feels the pain. What I'd also rather avoid are the convoluted and costly financial models being developed to make a broken system work.</p> <p>St Helena is a special case, with the challenges of climate, terrain, supplies and local people naturally wary of an unknown face. Then there is the unique natural environment, with 400 indigenous species including the wirebird and the world's oldest known living creature, Jonathan the giant tortoise.</p> <p>No wonder Charles Darwin liked it so much. The volcano last erupted several million years ago, which may or may not be a good thing. I am hoping that neither it nor the local people will have cause to erupt at my arrival.</p> <p><em>Andy Crowe is housing executive for the government of St Helena.

  "<p>High street retailer Comet is in trouble. Its chief executive Bob Darke has told staff that the troubled electricals retailer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/01/comet-electrical-goods-jobs-risk\" title=\"Comet: more than 6,000 jobs at risk\">will enter administration next week</a>, with Deloitte understood to be waiting in the wings to handle the process for the 240 stores.</p> <p>Shoppers will be concerned that recent purchases might not be delivered. If you have a gift card \u2013 Comet sells them in amounts of up to \u00a3500 \u2013 you may be equally worried you won't be able to redeem it.</p> <p>So how can you shop confidently on the high street knowing you won't end up out of pocket if something goes wrong?</p> <h2>Can I still shop in Comet?</h2> <p>Stores are still open, but the website is no longer taking orders, instead redirecting shoppers to a screen which says \"comet.co.uk is currently unavailable\". If you have vouchers, you would be well-advised to use them now, as in some previous cases retailers have refused to accept them once the administrators are brought in.</p> <p>If you are concerned about spending money in the stores, see below for details of how to protect yourself against future problems.</p> <h2>Can I still shop in a store that has gone into administration?</h2> <p>In some cases you can \u2013 and there are often deals to be had as a retailer desperately tries to get rid of its stock to raise as much cash as possible \u2013 but you might not get your money back if an item later turns out to be faulty.</p> <h2>I'm awaiting delivery of an item I've paid for \u2013 will I get it?</h2> <p>Contact the retailer to see what stage your order is at \u2013 if it's ready for dispatch the company might still be able to fulfil it. If it cannot dispatch an item check to see if you can collect it from a warehouse or store yourself, providing there are still staff on hand to help. You'll need to take a receipt or proof of ID with you.</p> <h2>What if it doesn't arrive or turns out to be faulty?</h2> <p>If the company is unable to fulfil your order and you are unable to obtain a refund or replacement for a faulty item, you may be able to get your money back depending on how you paid:</p> <p><strong>If you paid by credit card </strong>You are covered by Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This makes the credit provider jointly liable with the retailer for anything you buy, provided the item costs between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000. This also applies to anything bought with a credit agreement through a store, so if you sign up for an interest-free credit deal you are still covered.</p> <p>The protection covers undelivered goods and those that prove to be faulty, and you only need to have put the deposit on your card, not the whole cost.</p> <p>Should you need to make a claim, Citizens Advice has a <a href=\"http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/consumer_credit_act_1974_-_section_75\" title=\"Citizens Advice: Letter making a claim for equal liability from your credit provider\">template letter</a> you can download and send to your credit card provider. Bear in mind, the cover does not extend to items paid for with credit card cheques.</p> <p><strong>If you bought goods on other plastic </strong>You may have some protection. Visa, MasterCard and American Express all offer a scheme called chargeback, which allows customers to claim back money spent on a debit or prepaid card if the goods do not arrive or are faulty, or where the retailer has gone bust. There are time limits for these claims, so you should act as soon as you can. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jan/20/section-75-chargeback\" title=\"Section 75 and Chargeback factsheet\">See our factsheet for more on Section 75 and chargeback</a>.</p> <p><strong>If you paid by cash or some other means </strong>You will have to contact the administrators to make a claim directly. Details of who it is are usually posted on the ailing firm's website or should be listed at <a href=\"http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/index.shtml\" title=\"Companies House website\">Companies House</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/insolvency/personal-insolvency/individual-insolvency-register\" title=\"Individual Insolvency Register website\">Individual Insolvency Register</a> for sole traders or partnerships.</p> <p>You should do so immediately to inform it about the disputed purchase, although there is no guarantee you will get your money back. A company in administration will have a long list of creditors and it is the administrator's role to decide how much cash the company has to be distributed, which creditors are first in line, and how much each creditor will receive.</p> <h2>Are all gift vouchers worthless if a company is in administration?</h2> <p>Pretty much. It makes sense to try to spend a voucher as soon as you can once you learn a retailer is in trouble, as vouchers tend not to be accepted once a company is in administration. If you have unspent vouchers you need to lodge a claim with the administrators and hope for the best.</p> <h2>I bought vouchers using a credit card. Am I protected?</h2> <p>Section 75 means that buying with a credit card usually offers you protection when a company goes bust, assuming you have spent more than \u00a3100. But the situation with vouchers is more complicated.</p> <p>If there is no third party involved then you could be effective in making a claim. So, if you buy vouchers directly from a store to spend in that store you would be entitled to your money back if that store went bust (remember, this only applies if you've spent more than \u00a3100 using your credit card). However, if you used a third party such as a website that sells vouchers on behalf of a number of stores, you could not make a claim.</p> <p>Check out our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jan/20/section-75-chargeback\" title=\"Section 75 and Chargeback factsheet\">factsheet on using Section 75 and the Chargeback facility</a> for more information.</p> <h2>Will the guarantee I bought with my product still work?</h2> <p>Yes. Manufacturers often provide their own guarantee, while longer-term guarantees and warranties are usually underwritten by a third party, which will be legally required to honour contracts regardless of what has happened to the retailer who originally sold the product. In Comet's case, for example, its guarantees are underwritten by The Warranty Group.</p>",

  "<p>The latest government initiative to relax planning laws is driven by the need to stimulate the economy and remove obstacles in one of the most difficult fiscal environments many of us have ever seen.</p> <p>Planning legislation is about social policy \u2013 the maintenance of communities and the protection of the environment for residents today and into the future. It is also about encouraging commercial development. The economic viability of schemes is an important consideration and, thanks to the overlap between public and private interests, tensions often come to light within the system. Two questions arise as a result:</p> <p>\u2022 Do the proposals go far enough to make the balance sufficiently fair to all involved?</p> <p>\u2022 Will these changes improve and speed up development as the government hope?</p> <p>In the case of the proposed planning reforms, it seems the scales have been tipped very much in favour of private interests. If government rhetoric is to be believed, the proposed new regime aims to \"get Britain building\". Unfortunately this means that rather less consideration has been paid to how this will affect the wider public.</p> <p>For example, one proposed change is an expansion of the existing permitted development rights to allow for extensions to homes and business premises for a period of three years. Neighbourly discord is likely to increase as a result and some councils, including Tory-led Richmond, have already expressed their desire to restrict these proposed new rights in order to avoid local conflict.</p> <p>In theory, councils will be able to reject the government's proposals under the Article 4 Direction (more typically used in conservation areas) which allows local authorities to remove permitted development rights if these are seen to be harmful to the local community. If the government does permit councils to evoke Article 4, the proposal will achieve very little in reform and (by implication, at least) in assisting the national economy.</p> <p>A more tedious but equally important point is that these proposals are reliant on the resources of councils and the planning inspectorate for their success. Demand outstripping the capacity to deliver the reforms is a real concern for all involved.</p> <p>However, the prevailing view of the property industry is that the planning system needs a much more fundamental overhaul to speed up, simplify and make it more flexible (with or without economic growth). The proposals are certainly promising, but walking the tightrope between public policy concerns and supporting developers remains a challenge. This challenge must be mastered if indeed we are to get Britain building again.</p> <p>There is good news here, but we are a long way off striking that balance between sustainable public policy and the desire to support developers which would allow Britain to get building in any meaningful way.</p> <p><em>Rachel Lee is a solicitor at </em><a href=\"http://www.brecher.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Brecher</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/local-government/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>In the Qur'an there is no equivalent of blasphemy. The idea of reviling the sacred is of course condemned but this is markedly different from the way blasphemy is perceived in post-Enlightenment countries. Believers are urged in the sixth chapter of the Qur'an to \"not revile those whom they pray to other than Allah so that they do not revile Allah through their ignorance\". In modern Arabic the word used in newspapers and television for blasphemy is <em>tajdeef</em>, from the root <em>ja-da-fa</em>, which among other things can mean to propel a boat using oars. Importantly, the word <em>tajdeef</em> seems to be a recent addition to the language and is not mentioned in the Qur'an.</p> <p>One of the earliest examples in \"Islamic\" history of public cursing is found in the books of both the Sunni and Shia traditions. It is recorded that the Umayyad caliph Muawiya ordered that Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad, be publicly cursed from the pulpits of mosques. A number of people disobeyed the order and were punished for this. Subsequently, another Umayyad caliph, Umar bin Abdul Aziz, abolished this practice by invoking the 90th verse of the 16th chapter of the Qur'an which states that \"Allah orders that justice and good deeds should be done to kith and kin, and forbids lewdness, immorality and oppression \u2026\"</p> <p>There are strict Qur'anic injunctions for those who are deemed to be apostates and heretics or those who revile, curse, taunt or abuse, but these terms all have different contexts and jurisprudential uses from that of blasphemy. Similarly, the Qur'an takes a very strong view against those who create <em>fitna</em> (strife) but then almost every country has tough laws for the prosecution of those who instigate others in order to create public unrest. The second chapter of the Qur'an says that <em>fitna</em> is worse than killing. Importantly, it seems that the most severe condemnation in the Qur'an is for the <em>munafiqoon</em> (hypocrites). Notably, a hypocrite is the diametric opposite of a blasphemer in that he or she hold conflicting views in public and private while the latter openly airs their views. Thus, the hypocrite is much more dangerous.</p> <p>The question then arises as to why \"Islamic\" countries, for instance Pakistan and Indonesia, have such stringent blasphemy laws. Pakistan's law dates back to colonial times and was made even harsher during the presidency of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq\" title=\"\">Zia ul-Haq</a> who at the time enjoyed American patronage and was involved in arming the mujahideen against Russia. Indonesia's laws were formulated in 1965. Recently there was a controversy in Indonesia because a Shia scholar was charged among other things with blasphemy and sentenced to five years in prison. This is particularly relevant because the Indonesia's President Yudhoyono, wanted to use his platform at the UN last week <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/09/26/yudhoyono-touts-blasphemy-ban-un.html\" title=\"\">to call for an international anti-blasphemy law</a>.</p> <p>The basic motivation behind these laws seems less to do with religion and more to do with a desire by certain countries to create a homogenous society in terms of religious belief. Thus it leaves very little scope for any form of dissent and facilitates the persecution of minorities. This, of course, is also bolstered by the already exclusionary nature of nationalism. There are a whole series of laws in America and in Europe as well as in \"Islamic\" countries to do with hate speech and preserving the peace that should be utilised instead and blasphemy laws should be done away with.</p> <p>Muslims are not permitted to \"blaspheme\" for in doing so they are actually disobeying clear Qur'anic injunctions that prohibit the slander of other people's beliefs. Those who revile the icons and sacred spaces of others' religions therefore only disrespect the teachings of their own religion. Respect for the sacred spaces of other faiths was famously demonstrated by the second caliph Omar. When Jerusalem was taken he was invited by the patriarch to pray in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. He refused and prayed in the courtyard because he did not want to set precedent and endanger the church's status as a site of Christian worship. Today, it is ironic therefore that the very people who criticise the west and its policies often end up imitating and copying aspects of western thought that do not have their roots in Islamic thought.</p>",
  "<p>Hugh Grant and some of the country's leading journalism academics, including two former heads of BBC News, have renewed calls for the end of self-regulation of the press as battle lines are drawn ahead of the publication of the Leveson report.</p> <p>The actor has launched a spirited defence of the Hacked Off campaign which he fronts <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8743851/what-im-fighting-for/\" title=\"\">in the Spectator magazine</a>, claiming he is not out to muzzle the press and would close down the lobby group if he \"detected even a bat's squeak of genuine threat to public interest journalism\".</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8744591/what-the-papers-wont-say-2/\" title=\"\">in another Spectator comment piece published online on Thursday</a>, former Daily Mail and Daily Express political journalist turned PR Kirsty Walker made the opposite case, warning of the \"chilling effects\" Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry is already having on newsrooms.</p> <p>The academics, including the former director of global news at the BBC Richard Sambrook and the corporation's former head of news Ian Hargreaves, both now at Cardiff University, said in a letter published in Thursday's Financial Times that proposals for a new press watchdog made by newspaper editors would merely extend the life of the discredited Press Complaints Commission.</p> <p>In the Spectator, Grant said he would even back Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, who caused a furore at the Leveson inquiry after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/07/paul-dacre-leveson-hugh-grant\" title=\"\">accusing the actor of spreading \"mendacious smears\"</a>, over his right to be \"impertinent, spiky, nosey and unfawning to power or success or wealth\". \"[The press] have always pissed people off, as they should,\" he added.</p> <p>But he said the press are \"the Goliath\", part of the establishment that has \"effectively run the country for the past 40 years\".</p> <p>Grant said he would support Leveson if he were to recommend a new press regulator, independent of the industry and government, with minimum statutory underpinning.</p> <p>\"What I (and Hacked Off) campaign for is only this: that the press should obey the law and comply consistently with a fair and decent code of practice,\" he added.</p> <p>\"If we detected even a bat's squeak of genuine threat to public interest journalism we would pack it in. In fact, we also campaign for public interest defences in law for journalists in libel, bribery and other cases. We want more investigative journalism, not less. We want journalists to be free to speak their minds, unconstrained by their corporate masters. That's why we share platforms with the NUJ.\"</p> <p>Grant's Spectator article was published on the same day that 26 academics including professor James Curran of Goldsmiths and Steven Barnett of the University of Westminster came together to reject proposals put forward by newspaper editors and executives, who oppose statutory underpinning for a new press regulator.</p> <p>The academics dismissed the proposals as \"an attempt to perpetuate self-regulation by editors, an approach that has been shown over nearly 60 years to have failed both journalists and newspaper readers\".</p> <p>The proposals were made by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/09/leveson-inquiry-lord-black-lord-hunt-live\" title=\"\">Lord Black, Telegraph Media Group executive director and the chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, the body that funds the Press Complaints Commission</a>, at the Leveson inquiry after consultation with all newspaper groups including the Guardian. Black's plan calls for a new body which has the power to investigate newspapers and impose fines but editors would still be involved in the watchdog.</p> <p>Walker, who now works for PR agency iNHouse Communications, wrote in the Spectator that the mere prospect of Leveson's report, which will offer the government recommendations on the future of press regulation, had already encouraged \"the rich, the powerful, the venal and the pompous to intimidate journalists and frighten papers into not covering stories\".</p> <p>\"This is the judge who read a 200-word article in the Times about how The Thick of It was planning to satirise him in one episode \u2013 and promptly asked the editor of that paper whether it was 'appropriate' for him to run the piece. It is all too easy to guess what a judge with such an attitude to newspapers will do for press freedom,\" Walker said.</p> <p>The academics' letter and Grant and Walker's interventions marks a stepping up of the lobbying ahead of the publication of the Leveson report, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/30/leveson-report-late-november?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">now expected in the last week of November</a>.</p> <p>Ten days ago the Free Speech Network was launched with support from industry bodies including the Newspaper Society, Society of Editors and Newspaper Publishers Association to campaign against statutory regulation.

My wife resists change: she's sticking with Windows Vista and an old Nokia, despite my upgrade attempts, because they still do everything she wants. </p> <p>If it came to a straight fight between the Apple iPhone 4S and the Samsung Galaxy S III, then the Galaxy S III would win on having better technology while the iPhone 4S would win for having a better ecosystem, in terms of apps and accessories.</p> <p>In hardware terms, the Galaxy S III has a much bigger and better screen than the iPhone 4S (4.8in v 3.5in), and the screen has a higher resolution (720 x 1280 pixels v 640 x 960 pixels). The S III also has a faster processor (quad-core 1.4GHz Cortex-A9 v dual-core 1GHz Cortex-A9), twice as much RAM (1GB vs 512MB), and better battery life. Despite all this, the S III is thinner (8.6mm vs 9.3mm) and lighter (133g vs 140g) than the iPhone 4S, and cheaper (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-Galaxy-SIII-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0080DJ6C2/\">\u00a3385 at Amazon.co.uk</a> vs <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone/compare\">\u00a3449 from Apple</a>).</p> <p>The Galaxy S III also has many features that all iPhones lack. These include a standard microUSB port that supports USB On-The-Go and charging, NFC for contactless payments, a free FM radio, Adobe Flash support, and a choice of colours: red, blue, brown and grey, as well as black and white.</p> <p>Of course, it's unfair to compare this year's Galaxy S III with last year's iPhone 4S, and Apple has recently launched the iPhone 5. This has a bigger 4in screen with a higher resolution of 1136 x 640 pixels, and a much faster processor, so it comes closer to the S III. However, the iPhone 5 also has a new Lightning connector that is different from previous models, takes a new kind of nano-SIM, and comes at a very hefty price: \u00a3529 from the Apple Store.</p> <p>The Galaxy S III's numerous features appeal to technology geeks, but your wife isn't one. It would be perfectly reasonable for her to prefer an iPhone for other reasons, such as ease of use or the choice of apps. (Although Android now has roughly as many apps as the iPhone, the iPhone apps are often better.) However, she is already an Android user and doesn't appear to need any particular iPhone-specific apps, so I'd suggest sticking with Android. </p> <p>But I also suspect that she doesn't really need a Galaxy S III, and that either last year's Galaxy S II or the Galaxy Nexus would be acceptable alternatives. </p> <p>The Galaxy S II has a smaller 4.3in screen, but it's still big by smartphone standards. Obviously it has a slower processor (dual-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A9) and lacks advanced S III features such as LTE (4G) and NFC support, but it still has the microUSB port, microSD card slot, and FM radio.</p> <p>The major drawbacks to the Galaxy S II are the limited screen resolution of 480 x 800 pixels, and probably an old version of the operating system, Android 2.3.4 (Gingerbread). You should be able to update an S II to version 4.1 (Jelly Bean), but you can't do anything about the screen resolution.</p> <p>The advantage of buying the S II over the S III is that it saves about \u00a3105. At the time of writing, an S II costs <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-I9100-Galaxy-Free-Smartphone/dp/B004QTBQ2C/\">\u00a3280.60 at Amazon.co.uk</a>. (I'm quoting Amazon for consistency but you can shop around for deals.)</p> <p>Perhaps an even better alternative would be the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which has a 4.65in screen that shows 720 x 1280 pixels. In brief, the Nexus has the same processor as the S II, and the same screen resolution as the S III, though with a slightly worse camera (5MP vs 8MP). Being a Google Nexus, it ships with a clean version of Android 4, without Samsung's TouchWiz front end. And while it's an upgrade on the S II, it currently costs slightly less at Amazon.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-Galaxy-Nexus-16GB-Smartphone/dp/B005XYU45E/\">\u00a3275</a>.</p> <p>Find out the name and model number of your wife's Android phone, then go to the <a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com\">GSM Arena</a> website and click the Compare button. Search for and select your wife's phone and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, and check the line-by-line comparison. Do not buy the Nexus unless it offers a faster processor, a bigger screen and more on-screen pixels than her current smartphone. However, if your wife's phone is bottom-of-the-range, as you say, then it should offer a worthwhile upgrade.</p> <p>Whether the Galaxy S III is worth the extra \u00a3110 is a matter of opinion. You could take the view that it's well worth an extra \u00a31 per week over its two-year lifespan, or that \u00a3275 is more than enough to pay for a smartphone. Ask your wife, and see what she thinks.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Title:</strong> The Out Out Tour Live</p> <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2011</p> <p><strong>The setup:</strong> Standup's origins are working-class. In this respect, Micky Flanagan appears at first sight to be a typical standup comedian. Like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyrqcKRDncA\" title=\"\">Mike Reid</a> or Jim Davidson, he wears his cockney credentials more openly than most, and draws much of his audience from a similar background. In this show, filmed in Essex , he likens diarrhoea to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7tcwns5LmQ\" title=\"\">\"emptying an old radiator\"</a> \u2013 hardly the most bourgeois of comparisons.</p> <p>Yet while Reid and Davidson got and get their laughs by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKKPbNhTkL4\" title=\"\">asserting what they feel are the threatened values of their background</a>, Flanagan does thing differently. Having re-entered education, studied Kierkegaard at university and trained to be a teacher, he is now making money as a comic and has moved into the middle classes. He lives in East Dulwich, he drinks <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinfandel\" title=\"\">Zinfandel</a>, he attends NCT classes and his son goes to a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education\" title=\"\">Montessori school</a>. And most significantly, he has taken on the bourgeois tendency to self-deprecate. What Flanagan most often does with his old cockney values is attack them.</p> <p><strong>Funny, how?</strong> Stylistically, he is very similar to his unreconstructed forebears. He lampoons the cockney walk, although he himself struts about with something similar. He's got classic geezer-hands as well. When making a point, he runs a flat palm forward, like he's sliding a <a href=\"http://www.cockneyrhymingslang.co.uk/slang/pony\" title=\"\">pony</a> to you down the bar. Sometimes he makes that little flashing sign with all five fingers like someone flicking water off their hands. In the words <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W45t3kTXHM#t=3m00s\" title=\"\">\"out out\"</a> (disgracefully <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYC9eLLsDZ8\" title=\"\">ripped off by 118118</a>), he even has something approaching a traditional catchphrase.</p> <p>In speech, he also likes blunt instruments. During an extended bit on the rise of promiscuity (which he puts down to the \"disappearance of fingering\"), he remembers the old days when \"you have to tit the girl up for about a year!\" On his acquired habit of dipping bread in oil, he explains: \"It's got to be extra virgin. It's got to be oil that ain't been fucked.\" Flanagan can do subtlety, sure, but the strength of that line is the lack of it.</p> <p>Technically, he isn't perfect. He sniggers from time to time and stumbles over his words. At one point he tries to repeat a section for the DVD, but gets cheered down, and ends up yelling \"You fuckers!\" with a great big grin into the crowd. But it's part of the friendly informality of his shows that things should work this way.</p> <p>Which is remarkable, really, in such a political performer. Flanagan pulls out all the usual talk of \"Cressida\" and \"Hector\" while he tickles middle-class shopping habits, but then he also praises the parents for encouraging their children, rather than forcing them to steal chickens in their gym bag, like his did. He's witty in his descriptions of the days when men were men, but not at all nostalgic. \"They come home, they put the money on the table and they walk about in their pants,\" he says. \"My old man did nothing. If he shut a cupboard door, he thought he was helping out.\" Next time you hear feminism called humourless, be sure to mention Micky Flanagan.</p> <p><strong>Comic cousins:</strong> John Bishop, Mike Reid, Al Murray, Jim Jeffries.</p> <p><strong>Steal this:</strong> \"The most ambitious kid in our class was Gary Hutton. You know why? He wanted to drive a van.\"</p>",
  "<p>Darren Aronofsky's biblical epic Noah, starring Russell Crowe and Emma Watson, may be the most high-profile film industry casualty of Superstorm Sandy.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hurricane-sandy-how-costing-hollywood-384614\" title=\"\">Hollywood Reporter</a>, the exterior sets for Noah \u2013 including the 450ft-long ark \u2013 were constructed directly in the storm's path in Oyster Bay on Long Island Sound; the damage to the area has made it impossible to fully assess what has survived Sandy's impact. The $115m budget film was due to have finished shooting on 9 November, but this will be pushed back as the production has been shut down since Sunday 28 October. (It is due to restart on Thursday 1 November.) However, studio Paramount is confident no delay to its planned release date of 28 March 2013 will occur, as any losses will be <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/noahs-ark-hurricane-sandy-leaves-385024\" title=\"\">covered by insurance</a>.</p> <p>Another Russell Crowe film, the Warner Bros fantasy yarn Winter's Tale, directed by Akiva Goldsman, was also forced to shut down after New York revoked its filming permits, as was the Vince Vaughn comedy The Delivery Man. High-profile film events, including the gala premiere in Lincoln Square of the Keira Knightley film Anna Karenina, were also cancelled. The shutdown <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/31/superstorm-sandy-aftermath-nyc-entrtainmen_n_2048791.html\" title=\"\">also affected a number of TV shows</a>, including Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, 30 Rock, 666 Park, and Gossip Girl. Taping of live shows, such as Late Night with David Letterman, had to go ahead with no audience.</p> <p>Of equal concern to the industry has been the drop in cinema attendance directly attributable to the storm. With almost all cinemas in the region shut on Sunday, New York's box-office takings on Monday stood at $3,000, against a usual figure around half a million dollars, according to the <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-us-media-hurricane-lossesbre89u02e-20121030,0,6624719.story\" title=\"\">Chicago Tribune</a>. Takings at Broadway theatres have been equally hard hit. However, some compensation was to be had with reports that <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-netflix-hurricane-sandy-20121029,0,3261587.story\" title=\"\">Netflix experienced a 20% rise in the northeast US</a> on Sunday and Monday.</p> <p>However, independent film-makers without studio protection are expected to be the most badly affected. Anthony Mastromauro, producer of the David Duchovny starrer After the Fall, currently shooting in Connecticut told the Hollywood Reporter: \"Nothing can cover the loss of momentum, and that is what is especially damaging to smaller films like ours.\"</p>",
  "<p>The District Councils' Network has been a strong supporter of localism and our members have long been active within LEPs and city deals. We support the Heseltine review's recommendations to devolve more funding and responsibilities for economic growth away from Whitehall.</p> <p>However, Whitehall must put their faith in these local structures to deliver. Interference and top-down control will not help breathe life back into our local economies. If localities are to invest in growth, they must have the freedom and flexibility to do so, and they must not be caught up with meeting numerous government stipulations.</p> <p>Districts are a key part of this. As recognised by communities secretary Eric Pickles, districts already play an active role in driving growth locally. This role will become even stronger as the full potential of the community infrastructure levy, new homes bonus and the localisation of business rates is realised.</p> <p>The idea of reorganisation of local government is concerning and the universal panning of this particular proposal is welcomed. At a time of austerity and efficiency, a restructure would be seen as an indulgent activity from an bygone era. Districts are already one of the most efficient areas of the public sector \u2013 it is time to focus on our communities, not our governance.</p> <p>The focus for all local authorities must be on supporting communities through difficult economic times and helping the private sector to generate economic growth. If powers are to be devolved from Whitehall, both the public and private sector must be ready to embrace them and use these tools for delivery. Restructuring local government at the same time would dilute the impact of the proposed new powers and serve as a distraction from the job of delivering growth.</p> <p>It was right of the government to reduce layers of red tape and dissolve costly regional structures. Any new structures must only be established to benefit local communities.</p> <p>They must also reflect the principles of localism: no average person on the street will consider a region to be their local community. More likely, it will be their town, village or street. Growth will come from these local communities through increases in employment, local entrepreneurs, shopping locally and using local services and trades.</p> <p>Nurturing these is the job of the local authority and they must be given the freedom and flexibility to help organisations thrive.</p> <p>Whitehall must now find confidence in local democratically elected councillors. These community leaders know better than anyone the needs,, strengths and weaknesses of their residents.</p> <p><em>Emma Tucker is manager of the </em><a href=\"http://districtcouncils.info/\" title=\"\"><em>District Councils' Network</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/local-government/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice </strong></p>",
  "<p>The PPI mis-selling scandal may have been news for years now, but it shows no sign of abating. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/01/lloyds-ppi-mis-selling-5bn\" title=\"PPI mis-selling charge reaches 5.3bn at Lloyds\">Lloyds Banking Group has set aside an extra \u00a31bn</a> on top of the \u00a34.3bn it has already committed to compensating customers. The <a href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/\" title=\"FOS website\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a> (FOS), which deals with complaints that have not been settled to a consumer's satisfaction by a lender, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/30/fos-blames-banks-rise-ppi-claims-management-firms\" title=\"FOS blames banks for rise of PPI claims management firms\">is currently receiving up to 400 PPI complaints an hour</a> and upholding seven in 10 cases in the consumer's favour. Compensation averages \u00a32,750. So how do you go about making a claim for PPI? Follow our guide \u2026</p> <h2>Is anyone who had a PPI policy eligible for a payout?</h2> <p>No, you have to have been mis-sold the policy. It could be that you didn't realise you were taking out a policy and you didn't actually want it, or that you accepted a policy but it was not properly described to you. In other words you bought it not understanding that it wasn't suitable for you or not understanding how it worked.</p> <p>If you were unemployed, retired or a student at the time you took the policy out it was almost certainly missold. Have a look at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/interactive/2011/apr/21/reclaim-your-ppi-template-letter\" title=\"Reclaim your PPI: template letter\">template letter</a> we have created for you to make a claim and see if you think you might be eligible under any of the scenarios we outline.</p> <h2>How do I know if I had a PPI policy?</h2> <p>Banks have started a process of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/mar/06/ppi-misselling-banks-write-customers\" title=\"PPI mis-selling: banks to write to up to 12 million customers\">writing to millions of customers to tell them they may have been missold PPI</a>. HSBC says it will be writing to thousands of customers over the next couple of months, while Lloyds has begun the process of contacting customers. Don't ignore the letter; your bank has written to you because it believes it may have mis-sold you PPI and this is your chance to respond and get a refund of your premiums.</p> <p>However, you don't have to wait to receive a letter as banks are not writing to all customers who will have been missold PPI, only those they are aware of.</p> <p>If you are the sort of person who keeps all your old paperwork, check statements you have for previous loans and credit cards to see if PPI was included. It may not actually be called PPI on the statement \u2013 it might be described a something like \"loan care\" or \"ASU\" (accident, sickness and unemployment). If you're not sure, investigate.</p> <h2>How do I increase my chance of a successful claim?</h2> <p>Send copies of any paperwork you have, and include information about any old addresses and if you have changed your name. Ask the lender to look into every loan you took from it.</p> <h2>What if I can't find any paperwork or am not sure I even had a loan or credit card?</h2> <p>You can still make a claim if you have lost or destroyed your paperwork or even if you cannot remember who your loan or card provider was. If you think you may have had a loan or credit card that was active in the past six years \u2013 the statutory time such information must be kept on file \u2013 there will be details of it on your credit file. You can access your file via the three credit reference agencies Experian, Equifax and CallCredit.</p> <p>Once you know who your provider was you can ask that bank or building society for details of the account to see if you had PPI.</p> <h2>Is there a deadline to claim?</h2> <p>No. However, it is much easier to make a claim for a policy that was active in the past six years because this is the timeframe within which banks and building societies are required to keep information about the loan or card. This doesn't mean you have to have taken it out in the past six years: if you took it out 10 years ago but paid it off five years ago it was still active in the required timeframe.</p> <p>Even if you took out a loan that closed more than six years ago you can still make a claim if you have the paperwork \u2013 if you don't your case will be much harder to prove.</p> <p>In an extra twist, even if your bank says it has no information about your loan or card because the account was closed more than six years ago, you should still pursue this via the FOS. It says that although banks and building societies are only obliged to keep records for six years, many keep information for longer. The bank or building society may not be upfront with you about this.</p> <h2>My bank has rejected my claim \u2013 is this the end of the line?</h2> <p>Not at all. If you think you have a case you can take your claim to the FOS (<a href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/technical_notes/ppi.html\" title=\"FOS: online PPI resource\">full details of the process are on its website</a>). It says that in 70% of the cases it is now seeing where a bank turned down a claim, it was wrong to do so. The ombudsman can then order the bank to pay up.</p> <p>However, don't expect a quick resolution if you have to go down this route: the FOS has such a backlog of PPI complaints it says some could take years to resolve.</p> <p>You can only go to the FOS after your complaint has been with the bank for eight weeks and you must make an FOS complaint within six months of being turned down by your bank.</p> <h2>A company is offering to make a claim for me \u2013 should I use it?</h2> <p>Claims management companies have been making billions of pounds from the PPI debacle by taking on cases for consumers. They say they take the hassle out of making a claim \u2013 but you should ask yourself, how much hassle is involved? Look at our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/interactive/2011/apr/21/reclaim-your-ppi-template-letter\" title=\"Reclaim your PPI: template letter\">PPI reclaim letter</a> and see if you think you can make the claim yourself first. FOS staff will also help you if you need guidance.</p> <p>If you do decide to use a claims management company be aware you will pay that company a hefty fee if they claim successfully for you. This is typically 25% of the total claim value.</p> <p>Do not use a firm that demands payment upfront \u2013 you don't know if your claim will be successful or how much you will get. There are also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/06/ppi-win-cost-me-credit-card\" title=\"PPI 'win' cost me 1,090 in interest on my credit card\">cases where companies have taken the full value of the claim in fees</a>.</p>",

Yet an am-dram air pervades, even when The Time Warp finds the entire stage pelvic-thrusting blasts of steam and confetti.</p> <p>Rocky dispatched, a large red ribbon is stretched across the stage, from the centre of which DeLaughter cuts a heart to unveil the white-clad Spree of old. Even in this second set of their own material, they include a hefty chunk of the Who's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV_9pn7MGUo\" title=\"\">Tommy</a>, suggesting they might finish with a run through side two of Abbey Road. But the closing half-hour finally reaches event status: glitter cannons are set to semi-automatic, the ecstatic choral punch of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uzddaCSwpE\" title=\"\">Section 8 (Soldier Girl)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My4Khyt5_ps\" title=\"\">Section 9 (Light &amp; Day/Reach for the Sun)</a> is dampened little by the reduction of the choir to four. DeLaughter is a rousing presence, riding the crescendos and using a frozen pause in their Andrew Lloyd Webberian, prog-epic Section 19 (When the Fool Becomes a King) to wander the stage, playing everyone's instruments like a shaman who has stopped time. His unbridled positivity neutralises all traces of cheese \u2013 so expect them back on Valentine's Day, doing Mamma Mia!.</p> <p><em>What have you been to see lately?

  "<h2>3.45pm Epsom mulling Emily Davison anniversary</h2> <p>Further to the letter that appeared in yesterday's Guardian (see below), I'm told that Epsom have, for some time, been considering how best to mark the 100th anniversary of Emily Davison's death at the course in June 1913. Nothing has yet been decided but course officials hope to make an announcement nearer the time.</p> <p>It's a very difficult subject for any racecourse to approach. Davison's act has great societal significance as the most remembered act of protest on the route to women getting the vote. She gave her life to that cause and her memory is revered by many.</p> <p>At the same time, no racecourse dares risk being seen to condone people stepping out in front of a horse race, risking not just their own life, but those of the jockeys and horses as well.</p> <h2>2.35pm A wee Frankel montage</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4fJGldv-8Jw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4fJGldv-8Jw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Some BBC shots of the great horse on his last day out at Ascot.</p> <h2>1.45pm Chasing Amy</h2> <p>Here's the latest standings in the apprentice title race, which promises to be interesting during the last 10 days of the Flat season:</p> <p>Amy <strong>Ryan</strong> 40<br>Darren <strong>Egan</strong> 38 (injured, out for season)<br>Raul<strong> Da Silva</strong> 33<br>Sean <strong>Levey</strong> 32</p> <p>As we've discussed before, Da Silva isn't getting enough rides to make a late charge, but Levey really is. He had a winner for Ed McMahon at Kempton last night and has nine rides today at Lingfield and Kempton. None of them are strongly fancied, though I do think he may well win the last at Kempton on Kai (8.10).</p> <p>Tomorrow, Levey will put in another double shift with four at Newmarket and two at Wolverhampton. They include Ninjago for his boss, Richard Hannon, who is likely to be a strong favourite. </p> <p>Ryan, meanwhile, has one ride today and three tomorrow. Can she hang on?</p> <h2>1.35pm McCoy hits 100, departs at speed </h2> <p>Tony McCoy has just hacked up at Hereford on Vasco Du Ronceray, a 5s-on shot who became the jockey's 100th winner of the season. McCoy will now be driven to Stratford, where he hopes to ride I'm The Decider (3.10) and Twirling Magnet (3.40).</p> <h2>Today's best bets, by Chris Cook<br></h2> <p>In all the kerfuffle about Kauto Star yesterday, one item that may have been overlooked by racing fans is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/derby-day-tribute-suffragettes\" title=\"Letter to the Guardian\">the letter that appeared in the Guardian, calling for a minute's silence before next year's Derby</a> on the 100th anniversary of the death of Emily Davison, a suffragette who ran onto the course during the Derby and was fatally injured in a collision with the king's horse, Anmer. The letter was signed by all sorts of notable folk and the online version includes a link to a petition where you can show your support.</p> <p>I've asked Epsom for a response and I'll let you know if they say anything on the subject.</p> <p>On the subject of things that might be overlooked, today's racing starts with a Group One at 1.50pm, when Saint-Cloud stages its Criterium International, won in the past three years by French Fifteen, Roderic O'Connor and Jan Vermeer. That's a Guineas runner-up, an Irish Guineas winner and the horse who started favourite for the Derby.</p> <p>Aidan O'Brien has won it four times in seven years but is unrepresented this time. Ireland has a live runner, though, in Jim Bolger's <strong>Loch Garman (1.50)</strong>, who made his racecourse debut at Navan last week and won impressively. He beat Indian Chief, the O'Brien-trained 4-5 favourite for a race the Ballydoyle trainer had won every year since 2004. Indian Chief is a Derby entrant who cost 360,000 guineas at Tattersalls last year.</p> <p>Normally the step up from maiden company to a Group One would be difficult but Loch Garman has conditions to suit and the reality is that he may not have to improve much to win this six-runner affair. Obviously, you'd have to respect Triple Threat, an improver from Andre Fabre's yard, as well as US Law, who is proven in the conditions. Still, I make Loch Garman a bet at the 6-1 with Hill's.</p> <p>Bolger's comments in today's Racing Post are rather non-committal but he describes the horse as \"very well\".</p> <p>It's good to soft, soft in places at Hereford after 8mm of overnight rain, with more due this morning. That should be soft enough for <strong>Pericoloso (2.30)</strong> in the staying handicap hurdle, for which he's only 4lb higher than when slogging home at Exeter the other week. He won a similar race as a novice in the spring, when Ludlow's going was also soggy, but lacked the pace for good going at Aintree in between. He's fairly priced at 9-4.</p> <p>Still, Hereford has often seemed to be the home of well-backed winners with poor recent form and I'm beginning to think I may not miss it. Kempton may offer better betting opportunities today, despite the need for a modicum of luck around those tight turns.</p> <p>Roger Charlton may land both divisions of the maiden race that open the card there this evening.<strong> Serenity Spa (4.40) </strong>was an eye-catcher in an Ascot maiden in July, the winner having been fourth in the Listed Dick Poole on her only start since. Serenity Spa has been given time to come to herself, seems unlikely to meet any champions here and is 11-4.</p> <p><strong>Tartary (5.10) </strong>was only sixth on his debut over this course and distance recently but was green before staying on takingly at the end. He's 5-1 because the market likes Sky Garden, but that one has looked a bit one-paced in three turf starts and makes her all-weather debut.</p> <p>The mile handicap is competitive but I can't see why <strong>Shamir (7.10)</strong> should be 16-1, having won four times over the course and distance, including last time out. Yes, he has a wide draw but it's not as though he has to lead. In fact, his first win here was from stall 14.</p> <p>Finally, I couldn't quite bring myself to tip Godsmejudge, who makes his chasing debut at Stratford. I shall, however, be looking out for an opportunity to put him in a double with Ponmeoath.</p> <h2>Paddy Power tipping competition, day four<br></h2> <p><strong>TL127</strong> was the big mover on day three, picking both Bladewood Girl (5-1) and Ouzinkie (5-1). <strong>Captainconan</strong> had Bladewood Girl and San Telm (7-2). Both still have a way to go to catch <strong>Copshaw</strong>, who continued his good run with Bladewood Girl.</p> <p>Today, we'd like your tips, please, for these races: <strong>3.10 Stratford</strong>,<strong> 3.20 Lingfield</strong>, <strong>6.10 Kempton</strong>.</p> <p>This week's prize, generously offered by the bookmaker Paddy Power, is <strong>a pair of tickets to Cheltenham</strong> for <strong>all three days of next month's meeting</strong>, which they sponsor. That's Friday 16th, Saturday 17th and Sunday 18th November, with the highlight of the meeting being <strong>the Paddy Power Gold Cup</strong>.</p> <p>As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be four each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. If you have not joined in so far this week, you are welcome to do so today, but you will start on -9.</p> <p>In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/sep/07/talking-horses-tipping-competition-terms-and-conditions\" title=\"Ts  Cs\">For terms and conditions click here</a>.</p> <p>Good luck!</p> <h2>Standings after day three<br></h2> <p>Copshaw +26.50</p> <p>londonpatrick +9.50</p> <p>diegoisgod +8</p> <p>orso +7</p> <p>Yossarian24 +5</p> <p>sandiuk +3.50</p> <p>TL127 +3</p> <p>xwireman +2</p> <p>millreef +2</p> <p>SmokingGun1 +1.50</p> <p>William36 +1.50</p> <p>captainconan +1.50</p> <p>ToffeeDan1 +0.50</p> <p>chiefhk +0.50</p> <p>BearRides -1</p> <p>dannymacleman -1</p> <p>stee33 -1</p> <p>sidneyf -1</p> <p>coma88 -3</p> <p>JahLion -3</p> <p>factormax -3</p> <p>chris1623 -3</p> <p>CheeseAndWiiiine -3</p> <p>suckzinclee -3</p> <p>tom1977 -3.50</p> <p>melonk -4.50</p> <p>scandalous -4.50</p> <p>aj111jackson -4.50</p> <p>noodlearms -5.50</p> <p>slackdad38 -5.50</p> <p>GeorgeWTaylor -5.50</p> <p>calummadell -9</p> <p>72luca -9</p> <p>socialwanderer -9</p> <p>VolleVlug -9</p> <p>genesismama57 -9</p> <p>SMcSwollenhead -9</p> <p>Mai11 -9</p> <p>Toptrapper -9</p> <p>Murry Toms -9</p> <p>kingklynch -9</p> <p>paragoncup -9</p> <p>iainqos -9</p> <p>Blitzwing -9</p> <p>FinsburyPark -9</p> <p>SussexRH -9</p> <p>Dangalf -9</p> <p>maghazi -9</p> <p>shears39 -9</p> <p>Moscow08 -9</p> <p>brendandanger -9</p> <p>Neil Harris -9</p> <p>AlexCook -9</p> <p>no1octoberfest -9</p> <p>Mulldog -9</p> <p>sangfroid -9</p> <p>Lindsey6677 -9</p> <p>Shrewdette -9</p> <p>Harrytheactor -9</p> <p>tanias -9</p> <p>moidadem -9</p> <p>GForce1 -9</p> <p>23skidoo -9</p> <p>MISTERCHESTER -9</p> <p>natwho -9</p> <p>Rivercity -9</p> <p>carl31 -9</p> <p>paddytheirishman1 -9</p> <p>Ormrod76 -9</p> <p>Ellandback -9</p> <p>DearFrankel -9</p> <p>Sportingbest -9</p> <p>Click <a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings\" title=\"racecards\">here for all the day's racecards</a>, form, stats and results.</p> <p><em>And post your tips or racing-related comments below.</em></p>",
  "<p>In the wake of Wednesday night's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/31/cameron-commons-defeat-eu-budget\" title=\"\">Commons vote to cut the EU budget</a> (how cross that would have made a worldly EU leader like King Canute) I thought I heard a Conservative MP condescendingly explain that the 53 Tory rebels \"want to see Europe get real\". Oh dear, these are not wise words from head-in-the-noose romantics who want nothing better than to cut Europe adrift.</p> <p>Who comes out worse from Wednesday night's defeat of the government in a rebels-plus-Labour format, David Cameron \u2013 or Ed Miliband? You can catch the bad-tempered debate <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121031/debtext/121031-0002.htm#12103160000003\" title=\"\">here</a>, Simon Hoggart's take <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/31/haunted-ghosts-major-maastricht\" title=\"\">here</a>, tireless Andy Sparrow's live blog <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/31/politics-live-blog-pmqs-and-eu-budget-vote\" title=\"\">here</a>, Paul Owen's update <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/nov/01/politics-live-blog-fallout-for-eu-budget-defeat\" title=\"\">here</a>, while Nottingham University's revolts unit provides some background <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/parliament/2012/11/mark-stuart-and-philipjcowley-key-facts-on-the-size-and-nature-of-last-nights-tory-budget-rebellion.html\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>I'm not sure who's the bigger loser, but my hunch is that the short-term satisfaction the Labour leader gets from helping to humiliate the PM will be outweighed in the long term by the charge of shabby opportunism which fails to impress voters.</p> <p>Cameron is in trouble. He appointed pro-European Old Etonian Sir George Young as his chief whip two weeks ago and the rebels, admittedly fewer than the 81 who defied Dave last winter, defied the whip. Miliband may have a point when he called it Cameron's John Major moment, though Major won a general election and survived seven years in office (five of them years of economic growth), none of which either Cameron or Miliband has yet managed.</p> <p>But the Eurosceptic Tory right paid a terrible price for its intemperate and destructive opposition to Major's pragmatic stance on Europe. Their indiscipline \u2013 and his inability to crack the whip \u2013 appalled voters and helped New Labour into power in 1997. They uncorked the Ukip genie which threatens Tory seats in 2015 and is the calculation which lies behind so many of Wednesday night's cowardly votes.</p> <p>The result was William Hague's dire four years as party leader which, campaigning to \"save the pound\" from the euro (it was never in serious danger), knocked just one seat off Tony Blair's majority in the 2001 election. On <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\" title=\"\">Radio 4's Today programme</a> I heard George Osborne, like Cameron and his crew a son-of-Thatcher sceptic himself, calmly disparage the Hague era (he did not name Billy) as representing the same short-term opportunism that Miliband is now unwisely pursuing.</p> <p>It's not that the EU budget should expand at a time when national budgets are contracting, though 17 of the 27 member states are net beneficiaries, so they stand to gain some cash by voting for it. Remember, it was the Thatcher Tories who insisted on widening EU membership to the east \u2013 wider, not deeper was the slogan \u2013 so they can't grumble about that. Nor should they. It was bold, but right.</p> <p>But the issue is realistic politics. Cameron is probably right to say the best he can expect to get at next month's summit is a real-terms freeze, ie inflation-proofing only and that his second veto would be both unpopular and unwise since failure to agree a seven-year budget would mean the issue resurfacing via annual renewals, agreed by a majority, Britain's veto inapplicable.</p> <p>You don't need to have as many GCSEs as John Redwood to work out that option could prove far more expensive. Even Nick Clegg is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/nov/01/nick-clegg-tory-rebels-eu\" title=\"\">pointing that out</a>. Olaf Cramme offers a big-picture view <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/31/eu-budget-value-not-size-important\" title=\"\">here</a> for Cif.</p> <p>But it's not what this row is really about for many Tory MPs and activists. Like Alex Salmond \u2013 another romantic nationalist with a soothing panacea \u2013 they think Britain/Scotland will be liberated by the chance to cut loose. Free at last to do all those things \"Brussels\" \u2013 or London \u2013 stops them doing (I don't think).</p> <p>It's tempting to look at the list of Tory rebels and dismiss them as Ukip Lite, the revolt of the shopkeepers against the Tory toffs. Tempting but wrong. Apart from conspicuous plutocrats like Sir Peter Tapsell and Zac (Son-of-Jimmy) Goldsmith, there are a lot of lower-middle class Tories \u2013 <em>poujadistes</em> in the French term \u2013 among the rebels, but plenty of public school and Oxbridge types too. Like Britain's forests, the Conservative party is not riddled with the political equivalent of ash dieback fungus \u2013 imported from pesky foreigners.</p> <p>Tree diseases that spread in a highly mobile world are a handy reminder that we're all in these things together. But let's not go there today. Cameron will go to the summit and hope that the Germans support his demand for a freeze as the best he can get. If he has to veto a deal again to please his domestic woad-wearers, they will go ahead without him one way or the other. That has been the lesson of the Franco-German axis since 1956.</p> <p>That's not Labour's position, of course. Labour nowadays says it's the pro-European party, having passed the Thatcherites heading in the opposite direction in the late 80s. What Mrs T disliked about Jacques Delors's vision for Europe Neil Kinnock liked a lot. John Smith had always been pro-European, but he too played politics with the Maastricht treaty in 1991-92, much as Miliband is now doing.</p> <p>That's OK, you may say. The opposition is paid to oppose. I think that's what I argued in 1992 when I had decided that the centrifugal national forces at work in Europe were already overwhelming Delors's federalist vision. Since the bank crash of 2008 the centralising imperative is back with a vengeance, perceived to be the only way to save the euro. It's a fearsome gamble which may not work. But Germany, which has lent them all so much money, has little choice: the Wonga reich.</p> <p>Britain has been on the sidelines during most of the euro-drama. We have similar problems to many EU members states, from France down \u2013 too much public spending and borrowing, too sluggish growth \u2013 though like them we have stagnation with national characteristics, in our case a bloated, over-leveraged financial sector which has \u2013 how shall we put this? \u2013 been managed by Sicilians.</p> <p>Europe's older leaders remember being lectured on the British economic miracle by Blair and especially by Gordon Brown, who did not even do them the courtesy of staying to hear their replies. Ho ho. They think we have cocked it up worse than they did and \u2013 wrongly \u2013 blame the Anglo-Saxon banking model for their own failure to design their new currency better.</p> <p>Yet again perfidious Albion is unloved in Europe. We want to cut the budget. We want to have a referendum on new terms or even an exit from the EU. We don't even seem to be able to control regional politicians, they must mutter in Berlin and Paris. For God's sake, will a grownup do something about that Salmond man before he helps wreck Spain (etc) as well?</p> <p>Labour could play to this sentiment, don the long trousers and join the grownup wing of the EU debate. That's what Douglas Alexander, shadow foreign secretary, was trying to do in interviews this morning. The trouble was that he could only play the unconvincing hand he has been dealt by the colleagues. Confronted with Margaret Hodge MP's overheard remark that \"I hate this vote, I don't want to do it,\" Alexander sounded feeble. Perhaps he felt the same.</p> <p>The first awkward fact for Labour is that its MPs and any voters who follow these things remember that Blair gave away half Britain's budget rebate on a half-promise that something would be done to cut agricultural subsidies, which still dominate the EU budget \u2013 weirdly so considering how small a part of the EU economy farming now is, though less weird when we remember the sacred French farm vote.</p> <p>The second awkward fact is that it was a Labour government which piled on the debt during the boom years, over-dependent on the bankers' taxes which disappeared \u2013 like Vikings over the horizon \u2013 when the same under-regulated bankers ploughed their business and had to be rescued by you and me. Voters remember these things.</p> <p>Lastly, voters can hardly fail to remember that Labour is campaigning at home for extra borrowing to boost flagging demand in the economy and restore a strong recovery that will take care of the debt and deficit instead of deepening both. It makes a half-decent case for some steps in that direction.</p> <p>Is this the same Labour party campaigning for cuts in the EU budget? It is. If Cameron is lucky enough to come back with a deal from the summit it is unlikely to satisfy the rebels on his own side. So the two Eds \u2013 I detect the hand of Balls in this one \u2013 will have to decide whether to vote for it, to torpedo it or to abstain and let the Tories fight it out among themselves.</p> <p>Abstain is the statesmanlike option, also the craftier option, that they should have chosen on Wednesday night. The headlines would have been less disastrous for Cameron's authority than they are. But politics is a long game where character matters more than headlines.</p>",
  "<p>Since a booby-trap bomb exploded underneath the car belonging to the Catholic police recruit Ronan Kerr in April 2011 most of the violence from republican terror groups has been directed at their own communities.</p> <p>Since Kerr's death there has been one murder over the border in County Donegal and more than a dozen shootings, with all of the victims young Catholic males who were the targets of republican anti-drug vigilante attacks.</p> <p>Republican Action Against Drugs, alongside its new allies in what was the Real IRA, for a time seemed more preoccupied with portraying itself as an armed bulwark against alleged drug dealers than a threat to the state.</p> <p>The ambush-style murder, however, on the M1 motorway between Lurgan and Portadown early on Thursday morning underlines the deadly intent of its main reason for existing: to destabilise the power-sharing settlement in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>By killing a member of the Northern Ireland prison service, the dissident republicans have also opened up a dangerous new front in their armed campaigns. If their victim turns out to have come from the unionist community (where the prison service has traditionally drawn most of its staff) then this will be the first Protestant civilian to die at the hands of anti-ceasefire republicans in this current phase of violence.</p> <p>Until now, the Continuity IRA, Real IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann have attacked and sometimes killed British soldiers and Catholic police recruits to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the latter regarded by the hardliners as traitors for joining what they regard as a British police force.</p> <p>Targeting someone that most unionists would regard as having civilian status creates the potential for a loyalist paramilitary counter-strike, as has been the case in the past.</p> <p>Ever since the Real IRA Omagh bomb atrocity of 1998, the two main loyalist paramilitary terror groups \u2013 the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association \u2013 have refrained from retaliatory attacks either against republicans or the wider nationalist community. There will be frantic efforts now by the politicians at Stormont and mediators from the churches and the trade unions to persuade the loyalists to maintain that policy rather than be sucked into a new sectarian shooting war.</p> <p>During the Troubles, paramilitaries, mainly republicans, often targeted and killed prison officers as part of their campaigns inside the jails for political status, culminating in the 1981 hunger strikes inside the Maze. Up to 30 prison officers were murdered over the past 40 years, the final victim being killed by the UVF after a prison dispute between loyalist inmates and the authorities moved outside the jail and into the wider community.</p> <p>At present there is an ongoing dispute between republican prisoners belonging to the Continuity IRA and the new republican alliance styling itself as the new IRA, and the authorities inside Maghaberry top-security prison where the murder victim worked. These protests have also now spilled out of the jail and into Northern Ireland society, with lethal results.</p> <p>On a wider front this murder is a disturbing reminder that a small but active section of Irish republicanism remains committed to the use of arms in pursuing its goal of destroying the Northern Ireland state. With only a couple of hundred activists stretched in an arc ranging from Derry city to east Tyrone, north Armagh to north Belfast, the two main factions of recalcitrant republicanism are unlikely to wreck the power-sharing settlement or decouple the critical partnership between Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionists at Stormont.</p> <p>But as the Home Office warned just last week, while the new IRA and CIRA bombing threats to England have receded, the danger they pose within Northern Ireland itself remains, in the government's own words, \"severe\".</p>",
  "<p>There's a one-word explanation for the disappointingly weak survey of manufacturing out on Thursday: Europe.</p> <p>Despite some modest success recently in diversifying into the faster growing markets of the globe, Britain's nearest neighbours represent by far the biggest destination for goods sold overseas. Demand for those goods is being choked off by the prolonged and deepening slump in the eurozone.</p> <p>What's worse, the uncertainty caused by whether Greece will get a new bailout and whether Spain will have to seek financial help from the European Central Bank is depressing business confidence and causing investment projects to be mothballed. November's health check on industry from CIPS/Markit showed that demand for capital goods remains weak, and that is wholly consistent with a corporate sector unwilling to spend money until the uncertainty is lifted.</p> <p>The one bright spot in an otherwise gloomy report was that demand for consumer goods was up. That chimed with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/18/back-school-britain-retail-sales\" title=\"\">recent evidence that spending in the high street is on the up</a>, although the fact that orders for exported consumer goods also rose is something of a puzzle.</p> <p>As the CBI noted on Thursday, events overseas \u2013 the US fiscal cliff and China's slowdown in addition to the travails of the eurozone \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/01/uk-manufacturing-slowdown-continues-gdp\" title=\"\">are casting a long shadow over the UK manufacturing sector</a>. There are hopes that China has bottomed out, that the Americans will step away from the fiscal cliff and that Europe is finally getting its act together.</p> <p>For now though, Thursday's figures suggest that recovery will remain weak, that rebalancing is a pipedream. At this stage, the City is betting against further stimulus from the Bank of England next week but if the surveys for construction and services are as weak as those for manufacturing there may be a crash re-think.</p>",
  "<p>Ken Clarke's sentencing reforms could still fuel a 2,000-strong cut in the record prison population in England and Wales, according to official projections.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures also show that Clarke succeeded in arresting the rise in prison numbers during his period as justice secretary and prison numbers have stabilised over the past 12 months at the 86,300 mark.</p> <p>Clarke faced constant attack from the Tory right and the tabloids during his two years as justice secretary after he launched a scathing attack on the \"Victorian bang-'em-up prison culture\" of the past 20 years and set out plans to stabilise the growth in prison numbers.</p> <p>The official prison projections show that prison numbers rose by more than 2% a year under the last Labour government between 2005 and 2010 from 76,190 to 85,002. Since then prison numbers have steadied and are now at the same level they were 12 months ago.</p> <p>The ONS said that on a \"steady state scenario\" it now expected prison numbers to fall to 84,600 by next June. It said a combination of factors including Clarke's sentencing and punishment legislation, the release of last summer's rioters as they completed their sentences and a fall in the numbers the courts sent to prison would cause the fall.</p> <p>Clarke had hoped to deliver a deeper cut in prison numbers of up to 6,000 but a crucial part of his penal reform package \u2013 his proposal to increase maximum sentence discounts from 33% to 50% for early guilty pleas \u2013 was shelved in the aftermath of the row over rape sentencing. That element of his package would have delivered 3,200 of the 6,000 saving in prison places he was hoping for.</p> <p>The ONS prison projections show that on a more punitive scenario that assumes the recent decreasing trends are reversed and the courts start sending more people to prison for longer, prison numbers will resume their upward march once again. The statisticians say that under this scenario the current 86,300 population would rise to 88,100 by the time of the next general election in 2015, and hit a record 90,300 by June 2017.</p> <p>Since taking over the job, the new justice secretary, Chris Grayling, has made no secret of his desire to be seen as operating a \"tough\" criminal justice policy with one of his ministers, Damian Green, publicly joking to the Tory conference that while Clarke \"let 'em out\", Grayling would be \"throwing away the key\".</p> <p>The central projection for the women's prison population, which currently stands at 4,112, shows a slight fall to 4,000 by June 2013 and to 3,900 by June 2014 and is then expected to remain steady.</p> <p>Vicki Helyar-Cardwell of the Criminal Justice Alliance said the figures confirmed that the government had to go further in limiting the costly and wasteful use of prison for non-violent offenders in order to achieve a real rehabilitation revolution.</p> <p>\"We know that reoffending rates for short prison sentences are getting worse, whereas community penalties are improving year on year. Community orders are already more effective than short custodial sentences at reducing reoffending by at least 8%, which means less crime and fewer victims. In a time of fiscal constraint we have got to focus resources on what works to cut crime,\" she said.</p> <p>A justice ministry spokesperson said the projections formed a baseline against which future policy decisions could be assessed.</p> <p>\"They are a useful tool in supporting our capacity management policies as they take into account future demographics and make assumptions about how custody rates and average custodial sentence lengths could change based on observed trends.</p> <p>\"We are committed to always having enough places to manage those sentenced to custody by the courts and will ensure that contingency plans are in place to manage any unanticipated population growth.\"</p>",
  "<p>As a non-drinker with a somewhat limited income, my natural inclination is to avoid rounds. It's simple: my drinks rarely cost more than \u00a32.50 a go (even in the most ridiculously priced hipster bars of London), and my companions' always costs more. My friends are understanding of this, and have over the years, released me from the obligation of the round \u2013 when feeling flush, I take on the magnanimous qualities of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Chase\" title=\"\">Entourage's Vinnie Chase</a> (played by Adrian Grenier) and report to the bar with no quarrel, returning with a tray of drinks. At other times I demur gently, and slip away to get my cheap soft drink solo. It's awkward, but it works.</p> <p>The tea round is an entirely different kettle of fish. I always thought of the office tea round as a form of British social glue: small businesses consume more than 41m cups a day. So when I read of <a href=\"http://www.officegenie.co.uk/news/20121030-solo-tea-makers-could-costing-businesses\" title=\"\">recent study</a> by energy company E.ON, which claimed more than a third of workers in small businesses don't join in communal rounds, I began to worry about the condition of the glue bonds. Apparently these people boil kettles only for themselves \u2013 and a fifth waste energy by filling the kettle when making a single drink. As an extra note of interest, you are more likely to be making solo tea if you work in the education or hospitality (ha!) sectors. The study calculated that this practice could cost businesses just under \u00a332m a year. Is this the beginning of the end for the tea round?</p> <p>My very first job was in retail, working as a \"health and beauty assistant\" (basically I stacked the condoms and shower gels) in a supermarket. Our breaks were staggered to accommodate differently timed shifts, so tea runs made no sense, not least because we had no kettle, just an ancient machine that spat out horrible-tasting liquids. But as soon as I began office work \u2013 the kind that did not require a polyester uniform \u2013 I was initiated in the ways of the tea round. I expect most of us have done the tea run, however resentfully. Unlike the pub, the expense here is not cash; the tea bags, milk and sugar are usually provided by the workplace overlords. All you're investing is your time, as well as dedicating some brain space to remember the way everyone likes their cuppa.</p> <p>Of course, the office situation has additional social layers to it: your co-workers are not your \"real\" friends, and this is not the pub. Taking time out of your own working day to make several cups of tea for people you probably don't even like and who don't show appreciation can be a gentle slap in the face. We've all dumped too much sugar into the cup of the office bastard, yes? There's also the fear of inequality of effort: I once had a co-worker who always seemed to do the tea round begrudgingly \u2013 she drank vegan herbal teas exclusively, which required only hot water and a tea bag, and she hated that she had to spend time adding milk and sugar and stirring (!) for nine others. Then there are <a href=\"http://www.jeanhannahedelstein.com/post/17762481908/once-upon-a-time-i-had-a-job-with-a-boss-who-i-did\" title=\"\">those who don't drink tea at all</a> and who are forced to endure the rumblings of discontent from their colleagues.</p> <p>I currently work in an open plan office, where it is fine to be loud on phone calls, but not really the kind of place where you can ask the room at large if they fancy a cuppa. So we all slink off to the kitchenette to make our drinks solo, returning with steaming mugs and an apologetic smile. I'm happy with this. I'm a control freak with an intolerance to lactose and could never trust anyone to make my tea correctly anyway. So I make solo tea to avoid embarrassing would-be tea makers who would inevitably get my order wrong, forcing me to grimace through a too-milky mug of tea. In a roundabout way, politeness is what is killing the tea round. How very British.</p>",
  "<p>'Data as culture' is a phrase new to many, but its roots will be familiar. We live in an age of data-driven decision-making: decisions that impact every aspect of our lives.</p> <p>Whether it's the prime minister reviewing data about our economic growth, or your sister checking your <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/\" title=\"\">FourSquare</a> check-ins, data is ubiquitous and pervasive.</p> <p>Since the early days of the internet, and the web, we have seen more data becoming available. Mobile phones, smart meters and sensors, store cards, and social media are all generating data that simply didn't exist before. This is in addition to the huge amounts of information that already exists; health records, transport routes, maps, spending information, are now all digital \u2013 but rarely accessible.</p> <p>Open data does not mean 'all data', or that it's a free-for-all. For example, your personal health data is extremely private. There are benefits to access: for example aggregated anonymous statistical analysis can help us make better decisions. There are also risks \u2013 we know that companies, governments, and individuals are not always well equipped to handle information in the most appropriate ways. We also face challenges of transparency. We need to be clear on whose data we are using and how it is being used: 'provenance' or 'traceability' needs to form part of our data literacy. If a minister is making a data-driven decision about our economy, I'd certainly like to know their sources.</p> <p>Simultaneously, we now face new challenges that need different kinds of innovation, collaboration, and engagement. From environmental threats such as climate change and energy security, to social equity, and economic prosperity, we now live in an age where accurate information not only guides our decisions but the ability to examine the systems impact are crucial. For example, solving one issue, such as energy security, with the wrong solution will have devastating impacts on our environment, and such impacts will in-turn have devastating impacts on our economic and social well-being. The availability of data is crucial to collaboration, the development of novel solutions to problems, and to monitoring their impacts.</p> <p>We face three systems' challenges in the creation of a new ecosystem around data and information: supply, enablement, and demand.</p> <p>Founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt, <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/\" title=\"\">the Open Data Institute (ODI)</a> has been created to help address these challenges.</p> <p>Since assuming the role of chief executive officer in October at the ODI, I have been struck by the ubiquitous enthusiasm, and momentum building around this emerging domain.</p> <p>It's not just the Googles and Facebooks of the world who understand the potential in the system, although they have helped to trailblaze the path. UK government (cross-party) has helped lead public-sector engagement, and I have been encouraged by the government's desire for transparency and open data. Large corporates, start-ups, investors, NGOs, hackers, and citizens; all have interests in unlocking data, for many purposes.</p> <p>This places the ODI in an amazing position. As a non-profit, non-partisan organisation, we can help to shape the landscape. First, we have to facilitate supply: providing 'plumbing-like' processes and technology standards. Second, we need to make sure they are used: this means training people on what open data means, how to use it, and why it is valuable. Finally, we need to demonstrate value: nurturing organisations, new and old, to deliver positive change.</p> <p>Much of the rhetoric around 'value creation' falls short, in my view, of an adequate definition of 'value'. We have therefore, begun, by defining three focal points for our lens on value: social, environmental, and economic.</p> <p>To scale our efforts, we will also help mentors: training influencers within organisations, and creating experts that can empower others to unlock benefits from data.</p> <p>Critically, we have to focus on information that is useful. 'Build it and they will come' is not a good foundation for any movement. As <a href=\"http://archive.dconstruct.org/2012/admiralshovel\" title=\"\">James Burke</a> has noted, \"information causes change, otherwise it's not information\" .</p> <p>We are therefore in the process of creating a culture of experimentation, to explore and discover what works, what is useful, what is surprising, and what may lead to unexpected results. Continuous experimentation also allows for failure \u2013 without it success is impossible. &#xa0;In addition, there are some obvious areas, such as ensuring existing data is published in a structured, reliable, and traceable form \u2013 that will help us all access the data we need to make credible, informed decisions.</p> <p>We are off to a flying start: \u00a310m in seed-funding from the Technology Strategy Board, a 5,000sq ft space in Shoreditch, a post-graduate diploma in open data ready to go, a corporate membership model, our <a href=\"http://www.mastodonc.com/\" title=\"\">first start-up</a> in-situ, a number of hack-days, including seed invention events such as <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/events/hack4health-2012\" title=\"\">Hack4Health</a>, and our first public call: for<a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/news/odi-embraces-data-culture-art-commission\" title=\"\"> data-driven artworks</a>, to state clearly why data-as-culture is at the heart of our thinking.</p> <p><em>Gavin Starks is the chief executive officer of </em><a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/\" title=\"\"><em>the Open Data Institute</em></a><em> @ukODI</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network\" title=\"\"><em>public leaders network</em></a><em>, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

Clegg said he would hand a veto to the police and MI5 \u2013 both of which want to retain measures, such as the European arrest warrant, opposed by many Tories.</p> <p>In a speech at the Chatham House thinktank in London, Clegg said he was completely at one with the prime minister over the coalition plans to negotiate a real-terms freeze in the next seven-year EU budget. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/31/cameron-commons-defeat-eu-budget\" title=\"\">government was defeated in the Commons on Wednesday night</a> when Eurosceptic Tories joined forces with the Labour party to demand a real-terms cut in the budget that will run from 2014-2020.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister confirmed that the government would not accept an above-inflation increase in the EU budget negotiations. He also launched a strong attack on Labour, which brokered an above-inflation increase and placed the British EU rebate on the table when it led the last budget negotiations during the 2005 UK presidency of the EU.</p> <p>\"Their change of heart is dishonest. It is hypocritical,\" he said.</p> <p>But Clegg made clear that coalition relations over the EU remained fragile when he dismissed the prime minister's plans to use a future EU treaty revision to repatriate powers. The EU is expected to revise the Lisbon treaty, possibly after next year's German elections, to provide a legal basis for new eurozone governance arrangements.</p> <p>Cameron has said he would like to use the negotiations, in which Britain will have a veto, to repatriate some powers. These could be in the areas of social and employment laws.</p> <p>But Clegg ruled out Lib Dem support for this approach. He said: \"I want to focus on a proposal doing the rounds \u2013 that the best way to improve the UK's position in Europe is to renegotiate the terms of our relationship with the rest of the EU. We should opt out of the bad bits, stay opted into the good bits, and the way to do that is a repatriation of British powers.</p> <p>\"That seems reasonable. In fact it's a pretty seductive offer \u2013 who would disagree with that?</p> <p>\"But look a little closer. Because a grand, unilateral repatriation of powers might sound appealing. But in reality it is a false promise wrapped in a union jack.\"</p> <p>Clegg agrees with Cameron that Britain should opt out of some EU law-and-order measures. But under the Lisbon treaty Britain has to opt out of all the measures and then negotiate with its EU partners which measures to opt back into. Clegg made clear that he would not agree to the opt-out until he and Cameron had agreed on which measures to opt back into.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister indicated that he would give a veto to the police and MI5 which want to retain the European arrest warrant and Europol. He said: \"We will led by the experts and the evidence at all time.\"</p>",

  "<p>Tony Blair will pay interns working in his profit-making businesses, his private office has told the Guardian.</p> <p>The sudden change in policy comes <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2223647/Multi-millionaire-Tony-Blair-refuses-pay-interns-working-office.html\" title=\"\">less than a week after it was revealed that the multimillionaire former prime minister had been using unpaid \"volunteers\"</a> in his office for three months at a time and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/tony-blair-office-unpaid-interns\" title=\"\">a day after the Guardian published details of a possible investigation by HMRC</a>, which enforces the minimum wage.</p> <p>Blair's office was also <a href=\"http://graduatefog.co.uk/2012/2263/tony-blair-intern-rejected-couldnt-work-fulltime-unpaid/\" title=\"\">exposed by the careers website Graduate Fog</a> for turning down an intern who had passed a series of tests and interviews because they could only come into the office and work for free for four days a week instead of five.</p> <p>The series of emails between the intern and Blair's office \u2013 which included a list of tasks which interns were expected to carry out such as opening the post and taking phone messages \u2013 brought into question whether interns working in the Office of Tony Blair and his consultancy, Tony Blair Associates, were volunteers or workers.</p> <p>Introduced by Blair's government in 1998, national minimum wage law states that those <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@employ/documents/digitalasset/dg_199451.pdf\" title=\"\">who perform tasks that can be classified as work must be paid</a>.</p> <p>During the past 18 months <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/19/interns-payouts-minimum-wage-petition\" title=\"\">campaigners have been stepping up attempts</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/23/unpaid-website-intern-court-victory\" title=\"\">use the law to make employers pay interns</a>, who can sometimes work in businesses for more than a year without remuneration.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2011/dec/08/fashion-labels-warned-unpaid-interns\" title=\"\">HMRC has also been writing to businesses it thinks may be in breach of the law</a>, causing consternation among human resources departments.</p> <p>Last year, the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/nov/04/interns-work-paid-lawyers\" title=\"\">government lawyers had advised ministers that \"the concept [of internships] has become endemic\" </a>and that most employers were likely to be breaking the law.</p> <p>\"Legal colleagues take the view that most interns are likely to be workers and therefore entitled to the NMW [national minimum wage] and other worker rights,\" the document to ministers stated.</p> <p>In a statement last night, the Office of Tony Blair said it would now pay interns who worked for longer periods of time. \"Over the past five years the Office of Tony Blair has had a small number of voluntary interns gaining work experience in the organisation.</p> <p>\"The vast majority came to us at their request, unadvertised for voluntary work. Of those, a number have since become full-time paid employees with us. We have also always acted on legal advice in respect of any intern.</p> <p>\"Nonetheless from now on, if we do have interns for an extended period ie around three months, we will pay them the national minimum wage.</p> <p>The office added that the charities that Blair heads would, however, not be paying. \"Two of the charities do have voluntary intern programmes. As independent charities they pay expenses,\" the office said.</p> <p>Tanya de Grunwald from Graduate Fog, who help gather evidence against Blair's office, said it was <a href=\"http://graduatefog.co.uk/2012/2091/factor-internship-interns-win-wages/\" title=\"\">another victory </a>in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/30/miss-selfridge-interns-pay-arcadia\" title=\"\">string of successful cases</a>.</p> <p>\"This is a major victory for interns \u2013 and it proves that they have more power than they think they do.</p> <p>\"This is the latest in a string of cases where high-profile employers have either changed their policy on unpaid interns or awarded back pay to their young workers retrospectively as a result of our naming and shaming.</p> <p>\"Public concern about youth unemployment means it is becoming increasingly embarrassing for big brands of famous individuals to be caught using unpaid interns for extended periods and we are determined to exploit their fear of bad press.</p> <p>\"With Twitter and Facebook these stories can spread in minutes \u2013 and the nature of the internet means they can never be erased.&#xa0;As more interns are now coming forward to tell us their stories, big employers who have been using unpaid interns should be very worried indeed.\"</p> <p>However, Gus Baker from <a href=\"http://www.internaware.org/\" title=\"\">Intern Aware</a> queried why Blair wasn't paying all his interns. \"While it is good and welcome that Blair has relented and agreed to pay the interns in his private office, he still reportedly does not pay those working for his charity.</p> <p>\"Failing to pay at least the national minimum wage isn't just unfair on interns who are asked work for free, it excludes those who can't afford to. Tony Blair should know better and pay all his interns a fair wage.\"</p>",
  "<p>Since the dawn of the television age, political advertising has been a mainstay of American presidential elections, from the infamous \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63h_v6uf0Ao\">Daisy</a>\" spot from Lyndon Johnson against Barry Goldwater (the first political attack ad) to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbdzMLk9wHQ\">George W Bush's ad</a> parodying Senator John Kerry windsurfing.</p> <p>With spending projected to reach record levels, this election is no different. But behind the scenes, a revolution is underway in how these ads are targeted and delivered.</p> <p>Every presidential election can point to big breakthroughs in marketing tactics that are often ahead of their time, whether it was the first candidate websites that launched in 1996, following Bill Clinton's first term, or Barack Obama's domination of media in 2008, helped by a steady stream of content on YouTube, emails and text messages.</p> <p>This election is also evolving its marketing with the times and has embraced real-time media buying in both the display market but more significantly video advertising, which is important for pushing the emotive films and attack ads.</p> <p>In an election where everything can change in a minute, real-time buying offers flexibility and control, letting campaigns shift budgets, creative, site mix and geographic targets in minutes. For instance, if energy policy becomes a key issue overnight in a region \u2013 such as, coal country in key swing state Ohio \u2013 a campaign can create an ad on the fly, targeting specific audiences and zip codes with a video (maybe an existing ad or quickly-edited campaign speech) that explains a candidate's position on cap and trade and turn off all other ads that might be running in that region.</p> <p>Or if one candidate makes a mistake, the other can exploit it immediately and target ads to those who would be likely to change their vote because of the gaffe. An example of this would be Obama's description of Romney as a 'bullshitter' \u2013 likely to upset those of a delicate temperament and those who feel the presidential office holder should be held to a higher standard. Another would be Romney's use of the bizarre phrase 'binders full of women' in the debate which with such technology the Obama campaign would be able to target women in swing states with ads highlighting this.</p> <p>As well as allowing campaigns to take advantage of issues and gaffes, real-time buying can also help minimise waste as media becomes scarce in the days preceding an election. The campaign can invest exclusively in a smaller set of likely swing voters in swing states, and retargeted supporters can be shown a different set of creative more aimed at \"getting out the vote\" in the days leading up to an election.</p> <p>The targeting in political advertising is particularly rich, combining voter registration data and retargeting based on previous behaviour or opinion surveys. As with any campaign, marketers have an incredible amount of control over who sees an ad, where and when. The result is more hyper-customised advertising than ever.</p> <p>As in elections past, the tactics used in this election may prove to be a bellwether of what is to come for the marketing world generally.</p> <p><em>Brett Wilson is CEO of real-time video ad buying platform </em><a href=\"http://www.tubemogul.com/\" title=\"\"><em>TubeMogul</em></a><em>, whose clients include brand marketers as well as U.S.-based political advertisers.</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up</strong></a><strong> for free membership to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Talk about going out with a whimper. Reports have dribbled through to England that Sourav Ganguly won't be playing in the Indian Premier League for Pune next year \u2013 and as he had already made himself unavailable for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy, that probably marks the end of his career.</p> <p>Not necessarily, however. Sujan Mukherjee, one of the joint secretaries of the Bengal cricket board, has floated the possibility that Ganguly, who is now 40 but still looks disconcertingly boyish, may make a comeback if his state team are struggling late in the season. If not, this could be an unsatisfactory way for the most successful captain in India's history to bid farewell, and certainly contrasts with the clean break Andrew Strauss made with the game a few months ago, announcing his retirement in the same press conference at which he resigned the England captaincy. Yet for a couple of reasons, Ganguly will not be too bothered about that.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/345667.html\" title=\"\">Firstly, he's already had his grand farewell, in India's triumphant home series against Australia in late 2008</a> . Having hit a crucial century in the victory in Mohali which secured the series, he signed off with 85 and a golden duck in his last Test in Nagpur \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/giving-the-shirt-off-his-own-back-133-again/2008/11/11/1226318654419.html\" title=\"\">then threw his shirt to the crowd in a tribute to his famous bare-chested celebration on the Lord's balcony five years earlier,</a> which was itself interpreted as a riposte to his former Lancashire team-mate, but not soul-mate, Andrew Flintoff.</p> <p>Secondly, one of the great appeals of Ganguly has always been his lack of interest in keeping up appearances. Perhaps that is the result of the privileged upbringing in Calcutta, as Kolkata was then called, which led to him being nicknamed the Prince of Bengal during that brief and unsuccessful stint in county cricket with Lancashire in the 2000 summer. It now promises to make him a thoroughly readable and watchable cricket pundit.</p> <p>John Wright, the New Zealander with whom Ganguly developed such a good relationship when they worked together as India's coach and captain respectively, <a href=\"http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/item/198630-john-wright-on-sourav-ganguly-we-challenged-each-other\" title=\"\">suggested in a recent interview that he could become a cricketing version of John McEnroe</a>, who has so perked up the BBC's tennis coverage over the last few years. Wright may not have been altogether serious, to misquote McEnroe slightly, but Ganguly was certainly good value during his stints on ESPN Star at the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. He has the personality as well as the looks to act the mischievous schoolboy, teasing his fellow pundit Kevin Pietersen about his impasse with England, or a bad result for Chelsea.</p> <p>Yet there is clearly so much more to Ganguly than privilege or mischief. That was obvious from the <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63714.html\" title=\"\">Test century he scored on debut at Lord's in 1996</a> in an India team who were widely thought to be ripe for a thrashing, when another young unknown called Rahul Dravid made 95 batting at seven. Perhaps the best measure of Ganguly's impact is the transformation in the way in which India were viewed between that debut, and his last Test 12 years later.</p> <p>It wasn't all down to him, obviously. India had a few decent batsmen like Dravid, VVS Laxman and Sachin Tendulkar, an increasingly potent bowling attack, and an economy that was ready to produce the IPL. But most of those who have watched far more of India's cricket than me are happy to concede that Ganguly's aggressive and intelligent leadership played a significant part.</p> <p>I never got to know him very well during that Lancashire stint. I'm not sure anyone did. He had a tough job, following in the footsteps of Wasim Akram, who had become a close friend to the major characters in the Old Trafford dressing room \u2013 most obviously Flintoff, Mike Atherton and Neil Fairbrother \u2013 as well as a cult hero with the members. The gossip was that the Prince never really recovered from a bad start, on and off the field. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/jul/12/cricket.englandcricketseries\" title=\"\">The story about him ordering Atherton, then the England captain, to bring him an extra sweater on a chilly day is probably, unfortunately, apocryphal</a>. But there is no doubting the one about him running out both Fairbrother and Flintoff in a floodlit National League match against a Kent team including Dravid, going on to make a half century, then raising his bat to a deserted dressing room balcony. I was there that night, and also have a vague memory of him wearing a bright pair of shoes, although <a href=\"http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?209966\" title=\"\">that appears to be refuted by this hilariously over-the-top reaction</a> .</p> <p>My most vivid memory is of bumping into Ganguly in the souvenir shop at Derby on a miserable day. He was in there on his own, primarily to keep warm by the radiator, but it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that relations in the dressing room were a little chilly. Yet chatting to him one-on-one he was polite, engaging company. That's how I've found him ever since \u2013 the last time we spoke, in the Durham press box during the one-day series at the end of India's miserable 2011 tour, he was asking for some advice on the most attractive route to drive back to Manchester. Again; polite, intelligent, inquisitive, in those Harry Potter glasses.</p> <p>I'd no idea, until doing a bit of research for this piece, of <a href=\"http://scganguly.com/2012/02/sourav-gangulys-love-story-happy-15th-anniversary-dada/\" title=\"\">the background to his long-standing marriage</a>. Or, for that matter, that he's so widely-known in India as Dada, for filling the role of wise elder brother to the India team, that <a href=\"http://www.wisdenindia.com/category/article/dadas-pitch\" title=\"\">his column for Wisden India is known as Dada's Pitch</a>.</p> <p>One thing that has always marked Ganguly as a little bit different is his Bengali background. Kolkata has always seemed the most interesting and exotic of Indian cities, through some combination of reading about cricket matches at Eden Gardens, and about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_%28Marxist%29\" title=\"\">CPI (M) in my politics degree</a>. Yet other than Jagmohan Dalmiya, the head honcho of Indian cricket just as it was getting bolshy, Ganguly always seemed to be fighting a lone Bengali battle, with the big names and the big money concentrated in Mumbai and Bangalore. Now, though, there seems to be a new generation of Bengalis knocking on the door \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-blog/good-time-bengali-cricket-journalist/32690\" title=\"\">three of them (Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha and Ashok Dinda) playing for India A in England's opening tour fixture</a> .</p> <p>That's encouraging, but it seems unlikely that there will another Ganguly along any time soon. Surely one of the most influential cricketers of the last few decades, and arguably one of India's most significant of all-time.</p>",
  "<p>Though there are hardy souls out there, many of us become less frequent visitors to our plots in winter. Here are 10 quick but essential autumn jobs to ensure the veg patch is in a fit state for your crops come spring:</p> <h2>1. Keep on top of weeds </h2> <p>These opportunists will carry on growing where the soil is warm enough. If nothing more, cut off seedheads and incinerate them. Ideally, though, work over your plot now and uproot as many perennials as you can, or throw a 8cm deep mulch over annuals to smother them out.</p> <h2>2. Tend to your compost heap </h2> <p>Many of us load up our heaps in autumn, and then just leave it at that, in the hope that perfectly brown, crumbly compost will develop come spring \u2013 it won't. Turn full heaps over once every month to ensure all parts spend at least some time in the middle of the pile, where it gets hottest. This will ensure full and even decomposition.</p> <h2>3. Start digging - or don't</h2> <p>If you're a no-dig gardener, gloss over this tip; if not, read on. Digging the soil in autumn, before it freezes solid, exposes soil pests to foraging birds, and disturbs weed growth. Blitz small areas at a time and use a small spade that only allows you to lift a certain volume of soil, both suggestions so that you don't hurt your back.</p> <h2>4. Tidy your edges</h2> <p>Grassy paths will encroach onto bare beds, leaving you to scrabble about with a garden line and spade, slicing off the invading turf all summer. Put this unnecessary battle to an end now, rather than in summer when you're busy with other jobs on the plot, by either sinking a board between the earth and grass, or by excavating a small 10cm deep trench between the two. Done. Forever.</p> <h2>5. Cover bare patches</h2> <p>Either grab yourself an old tarpaulin, some flat-packed cardboard boxes or weed control fabric and lay over uncultivated areas. This will stop weeds in their tracks and help prevent nutrients washing out of the soil. Consider sowing a hardy green manure \u2013 there's just time to sow field beans or grazing rye now for a winter covering.</p> <h2>6. Net brassicas </h2> <p>Essential for those of us who love winter greens. Pigeons flock together during the leaner months and if they discover unprotected cabbages, caulis or the like they'll strip them bare in next to no time. Make sure netting is taut and lose ends tucked away. It's devastating to find a trapped, distressed bird because of a slapdash attempt.</p> <h2>7. Straw up root crops</h2> <p>Cold winters are more frequent it seems, and prolonged ground freezes follow suit. Maincrop carrots, parsnips and Jerusalem artichokes are impossible to lift from frozen soil, so mulch them to insulate. The simplest way is to pop a tunnel cloche over your row and pack it with straw.</p> <h2>8. Heel in leeks</h2> <p>These alliums aren't quite so easy to insulate on the plot, but their thin, fleshy skins means they'll perish if you lift and store them like an onion. The solution is to 'heel them in', which simply means to lift them and 'replant' them in a more sheltered spot of the garden (or a big bucket of compost in the shed).</p> <h2>9. Move wormeries </h2> <p>Worms don't like freezing solid either, it kills them in fact. Wormery owners should move their containers into a shed or garage. The worms won't be very active if kept cool, so just ensure they've sufficient moisture and a little food, before moving them back outside in spring. No outhouse? Bubblewrap is your answer.</p> <h2>10. Rake up deciduous leaves </h2> <p>Not to be tidy, but to make leafmould. The quickest way I've found to do this is to raise your mower to the highest setting and mow the leaves up (even if you rake them up elsewhere then scatter them on the lawn). This chops them up nicely, and adds a few grass clippings to the mixture, which speeds up rotting. Pop the whole lot in binbags pierced a few times with a fork and shove them somewhere out of sight. Open in a year's time to discover crumbly 'leafmould', which is great for potting composts and for use as a low-nutrient mulch.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Lucy Halsall is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.growfruitandveg.co.uk/magazine/\">Grow Your Own magazine</a>, which contains a wealth of information about growing your own vegetables.

  "<p>I believe, now that <a href=\"http://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Black History Month</a> is drawing to a close, we need to look at the future of BHM in this country and ask some serious questions. New research reveals that spending on Black History Month by London's boroughs has dropped by almost half. This is striking because almost half of Britain's ethnic minorities are in the London area and local authorities might have been expected to take it seriously. The worst examples of these cuts come from Camden, Greenwich and Westminster councils, who have completely scrapped their BHM budget. Others, such as Islington, Lewisham and Wandsworth, have decreased their budgets by almost 70% since 2009.</p> <p>Some might say that, in a time of austerity, spending on this special month is a \"politically correct\" luxury that hard-pressed local authorities can ill afford. But many are arguing that the collapse of interest in BHM reflects a more serious issue. Local authorities feel free to slash spending on it because racial diversity is taking a back seat when it comes to public policy.</p> <p>To understand the political significance of BHM, it is necessary to understand its history. The first BHM event was organised by the Greater London Council in 1987 (which was also the year when history was made, with black MPs including me being elected to parliament). But BHM wasn't just an isolated celebration. It was part of a successful move to fight racism and push racial equality up the political agenda. Lord Herman Ouseley, Lady Valerie Amos and Lord Boateng all made their names as young black radicals in the local authority politics of the period. They argued for and implemented a whole range of policies on racial equality, most crucially around employment, housing and the voluntary sector.</p> <p>Without that political campaigning, London might have fallen victim to the entrenched political inequality and separatism that characterises so many northern towns. The BNP found it much harder to get a foothold in London than in the industrial north. This is the legacy of the anti-racist campaigning of the 1980s in which BHM played an important, symbolic role.</p> <p>When Boris Johnson became mayor of London, one of the first things he did was to slash spending on BHM by 92%, completely eliminate funding for Africa Day and remove the funding for London's anti-racism festival, Rise. The symbolism was unmistakable and was not lost on London's black population.</p> <p>What is harder to document is the picture that is gradually becoming clear of millions of pounds of public sector cuts which are falling most heavily on ethnic minority staff and the ethnic minority-led voluntary sector. There is the old American saying \"Last to be hired; first to be fired\" And BME workers, particularly at a management level, are a relatively recent phenomenon in the white-collar public sector world particularly at a management level. BME workers, particularly black women, are heavily over-represented in the public sector. One of the reasons for this is because local authorities \u2013 precisely because of the political campaigns of the 80s \u2013 have been more willing to adopt fair and transparent employment policies.</p> <p>Some of the left react badly when the argument is made that the cuts are falling most heavily on the black community. They claim it is wrong to \"racialise\" the effects of austerity. But a wilful refusal to even consider that the cuts may hit BME communities hardest is dangerous. When those communities explode it is too easy to see it merely as a law and order problem rather than to look at the underlying economic issues.</p>",
  "<p>The Force is strong with this one. To celebrate Halloween, Juventus posted a series of pictures on Facebook and Twitter in which their players were reimagined as ghosts, ghouls or other sinister characters.

Moments later his swerving left-footed drive from outside the box would crash away off the post. \"It was a 20-minute hurricane against the Bologna defence,\" wrote Diego Costa in La Repubblica. \"A 'Sandy' called Pogba.\"</p> <p>If the visitors somehow clung on to half-time, suffering another narrow escape just before the break when Pogba headed wide from six yards out, then they were only delaying the inevitable. Nine minutes into the second half the same player bypassed Bologna's defence with an immaculate chipped pass that picked out Emmanuele Giaccherini running into the box. He headed the ball across goal for Fabio Quagliarella to prod home.</p> <p>Pogba's only mistake to that point might have been making it look too easy. A quarter of an hour later his team-mate Paolo De Ceglie would attempt to mimic that chip \u2013 only this time from down near his own team's goal-line. The ball fell to Bologna's Saphir Ta\u00efder, who brought it under control before dispatching it from the edge of the area to the bottom corner of Buffon's net. It was his team's first shot on target.</p> <p>Suddenly it was Juventus who were being haunted by the ghosts of seasons past. Last year they had drawn both of their league games against these opponents by the same scoreline: 1-1. The timing was less than ideal. As things stood, the <em>Bianconeri</em> would go into the weekend's match against Inter with just a two-point lead over those opponents at the top of Serie A.</p> <p>Pogba, though, was not done yet. Two minutes into injury-time, his close-range header from a Sebastian Giovinco cross sealed the points for his team.</p> <p>Up in the press box at Juventus Stadium, reporters were running out of superlatives. \"Paul Pogba beats Bologna 2-1,\" ran the opening line of Il Messaggero's report, while Mediaset declared the midfielder to be the real \"monster\" of All Hallows' Eve. \"You're 19 years old Paul, can't you mess <em>something</em> up?\" demanded Gazzetta dello Sport's GB Olivero.</p> <p>\"It is early to make comparisons,\" wrote Olivero's colleague Fabio Bianchi, before going on to do precisely that. \"But this Pogba resembles a certain Mr Vieira. He could even be better. He is only 19.\"</p> <p>If that is an absurdly premature statement to make, this being just Pogba's third start for the club, then it is certainly easy to understand now why Sir Alex Ferguson was so frustrated to see the player leave this summer. The Manchester United manager accused Pogba, who had turned down several offers of a new contract, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jul/04/manchester-united-paul-pogba-juventus\" title=\"\">of showing a lack of respect to the club</a> who had themselves spirited him away from Le Havre in 2009.</p> <p>Pogba, though, insisted that he had no regrets, claiming that Ferguson had not trusted him. Granted just three league appearances by United \u2013 who received a token \u20ac1m in compensation \u2013 prior to his departure, he declared himself \"impatient\" but also insisted he had been made no guarantees of a starting spot at Juventus. \"The coach [Antonio Conte] told me there are a lot of games and he wanted a substitute for [Arturo] Vidal and [Andrea] Pirlo,\" said Pogba. \"He didn't tell me I would play a certain number of matches.\"</p> <p>The competition for places in Juventus's first-choice midfield is indeed fierce, with Pogba theoretically needing to displace one of Vidal, Pirlo or Claudio Marchisio in order to start. It was a conundrum neatly summed up by Olivero in Gazzetta: \"Will Ferguson curse over not having kept him at Manchester? Very probably yes. Will Didier Deschamps, the France manager, call him up for the first time in a few days? Very probably yes.</p> <p>\"And will Conte leave him out for the big match on Saturday against Inter? Very probably yes, unless ankle problems keep out Marchisio. The hierarchy is clear, Vidal and the Little Prince [Marchisio] have never got it wrong in the most important games. They deserve faith.\"</p> <p>Pogba himself did not seem overly troubled by the question of whether he would start against Inter, saying he just wanted to enjoy the moment and that he knew he still had lots of room for improvement. Conte's assistant manager, Angelo Alessio, sought to temper any over-enthusiasm by claiming that Pogba had cooled off after his first 20 minutes and was guilty of over-elaboration.</p> <p>But the truth is that Pogba does not need to supplant any member of Conte's first-choice XI in order to be a factor for Juve. With the added challenge of a European campaign to deal with this season, the manager is well aware of the need to keep all of his players fresh, and the team he sent out on Wednesday featured five changes from the one that had beaten Catania on Sunday.</p> <p>Not all of those replacements impressed \u2013 De Ceglie struggling even before his critical lapse of judgment. But it is precisely the addition of such options as Pogba, Kwadwo Asamoah and Mauricio Isla that make this year's Juve team look so ominous \u2013 rendering them that much less likely to slip up in the fixtures against 'lesser' opponents such as Bologna. The <em>Bianconeri</em>, unbeaten in 49 dating back to last season, have dropped just two points in the first 10 games of this campaign.</p> <p>On Saturday they face what might be their biggest domestic challenge to date \u2013 Inter having won their last eight games in all competitions and who moved up to second in the table with their 3-2 victory over Sampdoria on Wednesday. Andrea Stramaccioni's side have also triumphed in all eight of their away games this season between league and Europe.</p> <p>The <em>Nerazzurri</em> may well not have to deal with Pogba on Saturday, for all the reasons outlined above. But as a reflection of the strength of this Juventus team, that might be the scariest thing of all.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Only one Inter manager, incidentally, has ever overseen a longer run of all-competition wins than Stramaccioni's present eight-game stretch. That was, of course, Roberto Mancini back in 2006-07. Previously Claudio Ranieri, Giovanni Trapattoni and Gigi Simoni had matched his eight-game run.</p> <p>\u2022 Inter look more and more like, to use the Italian newspaper parlance, this year's \"anti-Juve\" \u2013 not least because the other would-be contenders are beginning to show their flaws. Napoli were without Edinson Cavani again for their trip to Atalanta this week and their reliance on the striker could scarcely have been more sharply highlighted. Without him Napoli dominated, registering nine shots on target to Atalanta's one, but still lost.</p> <p>\u2022 The theme of this week's round was undoubtedly the comeback \u2013 Inter recovering from a goal down in their win, just as Parma did against Roma (though frankly at this rate it will soon only be the Roma games without a second-half comeback that are noteworthy). Milan were 2-0 down after 50 minutes of their match in Palermo but recovered to draw 2-2. Antonio Di Natale put Udinese 1-0 up against Catania after half an hour, then had to rescue a point for his team in the 93rd minute after they had blown that advantage.</p> <p>\u2022 Speaking of Di Natale \u2013 that's now four goals in his last two games. Without him, it is clear that this Udinese team would be struggling far more greatly in the wake of their latest round of departures. Just because he's been doing it for four years now, doesn't stop it being remarkable.</p> <p>\u2022 Roma did not just frustrate their own fans this midweek. To reach Parma the team had decided to take the train, taking advantage of Trenitalia's high-speed service. The train company, however, had neglected to inform its other passengers of this stop \u2013 which reportedly caused an unexpected delay of over half an hour to their journey. Trenitalia have offered passengers a 25% reimbursement on their ticket purchases. No such refund has yet been offered to the Roma fans beginning to despair at their team's total inability to defend.</p> <p>\u2022 For Milan, meanwhile, it was a case of another game, yet another formation from the manager Massimiliano Allegri \u2013 experimenting this time with a 3-5-2. On Wednesday the team's vice-president, Adriano Galliani, once again reassured his manager that his job was safe, saying that he had resolved one or two of his own disagreements with the manager and that the team's owner, Silvio Berlusconi, was calm. \"[But] I get angry when I see five holding midfielders,\" Galliani added. The one bright note was, as ever, Stephan El Shaarawy. He now has seven goals in 10 league games, and remains one of the great revelations of this Serie A season to date.</p> <p><strong>Results: Atalanta 1-0 Napoli, Cagliari 4-2 Siena, Chievo 2-0 Pescara, Inter 3-2 Sampdoria, Juventus 2-1 Bologna, Lazio 1-1 Torino, Palermo 2-2 Milan, Parma 3-2 Roma, Udinese 2-2 Catania</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=13\" title=\"\">Latest Serie A standings</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The story of Morgan Odhiambo, a refugee who chose Britain as a place of sanctuary, is sadly typical. </p> <p>In his native Kenya he suffered from corruption and brutality. After his car was stolen he suspected that police, after recovering it, made money by selling it on.</p> <p>When he challenged them about their fraudulent practices he was beaten and received threats that scared him enough to flee.</p> <p>Like many people who live in countries once colonised by the British, and who become victims of corrupt political systems where the rule of law does not pertain, he decided to come to Britain.</p> <p>He arrived here in 2003 and immediately ran into rampant prejudice against people collectively known as \"asylum seekers.\"</p> <p>Despite the fact that many British people were kind and welcoming, he ran up against plenty of scorn. Why? Gradually, he became convinced that it was due to negative press coverage. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"People get their view from the newspapers. People look at you like you're a scrounger. They think you're just 'one of them'. They think you're just here to take their money or their job. They just don't know the truth.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Depressed by the hostility, he was also frustrated during a long battle to win asylum. A major turning point came in 2009 when he contacted the Red Cross and with its help, he finally became a British citizen in 2011. </p> <p>Now Morgan, a 40-year-old computing student who is married with five children, is living happily near Milton Keynes. But he wishes his experience on arriving in Britain had been different and believe better, more sympathetic reporting by newspapers about the reality of life as a refugee, would have helped. </p> <p>\"The answer is to educate people so they know most asylum seekers are genuine and not really bad,\" he says. </p> <h2>Call for action by the Red Cross</h2> <p>Morgan's story is one of many that the Red Cross has heard during its years of helping asylum seekers and refugees, convincing the charity that fresh media guidance is necessary. </p> <p>It is \"gravely concerned\" about negative reporting on asylum seekers that ignores <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=OTE=\">guidance circulated to editors by the Press Complaints Commission</a> in October 2003, which addressed inaccurate reporting about all refugees.</p> <p>The Red Cross cites an independent survey - carried out by YouGov* - which shows that 72% of the UK public believe newspaper reporting about asylum seekers and refugees is negative.<br> The survey also found that the words people most associate with media coverage of refugees and asylum seekers are \"illegal immigrants\" (65%) and \"scroungers\" (28%). </p> <p>Now the charity is calling for fairer, and more accurate, press treatment of people who seek sanctuary in Britain.</p> <p>To that end, it has issued a set of demands for the new press regulator to take on board:</p> <p><strong>Stop</strong> irrelevant references to immigration status appearing in negative stories about individuals;</p> <p><strong>Give</strong> the Red Cross and others the chance to speak up in defence of refugees and asylum seekers;</p> <p><strong>Monitor</strong> standards of reporting pro-actively instead of waiting for individual complaints;</p> <p><strong>Crack down</strong> on inaccurate uses of terms such as \"bogus\" and \"illegal\" when mentioning asylum seekers.</p> <p>I thought we had sorted out that last problem ages ago, but here's a Times headline published in June last year, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3064981.ece\">DNA test for bogus refugees scrapped as expensive flop</a>.

  "<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that public health directors will need to exercise fine political judgment if they are to thrive in their new position dangling precariously between central and local government.</p> <p>In some councils their first job may well be to cut services. There are serious concerns that a toxic combination of the wrong amount of money being transferred from primary care trusts, and the new budget holders being locked into large, long-term contracts on everything from dental health promotion to health checks, means that once the money for statutory services is taken out local priorities such as tackling child obesity could suffer.</p> <p>Then there is their position in the council. The government has sensibly shied away from being too prescriptive about where public health directors should sit in the local authority hierarchy. It has not stipulated that they must be on the corporate management team, but says they must have \"direct accountability\" to the chief executive.</p> <p>Nonetheless, it would be foolish of a council not to give a public health director the same status as the heads of other major services. Such a snub may well be symptomatic of an authority which has not grasped the importance of what it is taking on.</p> <p>Local government is respectful of the skills public health experts will bring to the sector. In particular, there is growing interest among councils in providing a much firmer evidence for policy decisions, and the <a href=\"http://www.solace.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Society of Local Authority Chief Executives</a> has said it hopes the research and evidence skills of public health will help develop the expertise of other staff.</p> <p>But what happens when evidence and politics collide? There was a revealing discussion at a fringe meeting at this autumn's Labour party conference, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/oct/02/council-sensitive-issues-public-health\" title=\"\">a councillor warned that local authorities may be wary of tackling problems such as teenage pregnancy</a>, sexual infection and the health risks faced by sex workers. There is a serious danger that public health directors will be caught in the crossfire of such a debate, feeling it is their duty to speak out even if it contradicts their political masters. Such disputes are likely to be the severest test of this new relationship.</p> <p>As recent <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/10/public-director/\" title=\"\">guidance from the Department of Health</a> makes clear, public health directors could be in an uncomfortable position, caught between the secretary of state and the council, if things go wrong.</p> <p>Under the guidance, public health directors have a duty to publish an independent report each year. This is, in some ways, analogous to the powers of a council's so-called \"section 151 officer\" \u2013 usually the finance director \u2013 who has a duty to report on issues of probity and legality.</p> <p>In statutory terms this annual report is a reassuring affirmation of public health directors' freedom to speak their mind. However, it runs the risk of them being seen to judge a wide range of council policies, on everything from children to housing. For example, directors will no doubt use the report to comment on whether the council has listened to the advice they are required to give on licensing applications. Has the need for a strong night-time economy overridden the requirements of public health? All this is dangerous territory for a local government director, whatever the DoH guidance says.</p> <p>The tensions could also run in the other direction, of course. The DoH says Public Health England has a duty \"to promote local autonomy so far as that is compatible with the interests of the comprehensive health service\". It would be surprising \u2013 and disappointing \u2013 if some directors, intoxicated by the liberation of leaving direct NHS control, didn't want to try to distance themselves from the authority of the health secretary and Public Health England to focus far more on local priorities than national ones. Such people could become a test case for the DoH's tolerance of local autonomy.</p> <p>But despite all the potential pitfalls there is palpable optimism \u2013 even excitement \u2013 in local government at the potential for their new role, and the chance to finally develop a sophisticated approach to tackling health inequalities. The biggest problem public health directors may well face is managing expectations.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The 28th work of fiction from Scotland's most successful crime writer turns on five ominous disappearances \u2013 young women who went missing close to the A9 road over a 10-year period \u2013 and an entirely welcome reappearance. DI John Rebus, retired in 2006 after 18 cases in line with Ian Rankin's hyper-realistic policy of ageing his characters in real time, has now returned to work, again in line with actual police procedure, as a civilian consultant on cold case inquiries.</p> <p>Complicatingly, in the publishing equivalent of a man coming back from the war to find his wife married to someone else, Rebus bumps into Rankin's new literary partner. Malcolm Fox of the ethics and standards division \u2013 hero of Rankin's two most recent police books, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/crime/9780752889511/the-complaints\" title=\"\"><em>The Complaints</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/28/impossible-dead-ian-rankin-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Impossible Dead</em></a> \u2013 is horrified to discover that the cop he regards as \"the loosest of canons\" is back on police business, and reactivates the \"whole shelf\" of complaints made against Rebus during his career. Fox's hope is to prevent Rebus from corrupting his former sidekick, DS Siobhan Clarke.</p> <p>The sections in which Rankin's two characters find themselves in the same book are fascinating psychologically because the author so clearly lets the older man have the better of the exchanges. When Rebus notes Fox \"sliming\" around HQ and reflects that he seems more like \"middle management in a plastics company\", it's clearly what Rebus would think about the interloper, but also usefully channels a resentment that Rankin readers must inevitably feel about the loss of their favourite cop. There is also the tantalising possibility that Rankin is employing Rebus to express his own equivocations about the replacement character.</p> <p>Although their behaviour seems starkly contrasting \u2013 Fox sipping Appletiser, Rebus swigging beer and whisky \u2013 one sentence suggests that the men are more similar than they, or we, may think: \"Fox had ceased to take alcohol because he was an alcoholic, while Rebus continued to sup for the exact same reason.\" That line links to the Jekyll/Hyde divide that runs through Scottish literature and, indeed, the early Rebus novel <em>Hide and Seek</em>. If there is another double novel, Rankin could usefully make more of this conceit.</p> <p>Admirers of the Rebus books will be&#xa0;relieved the hero has returned with little change except an increase in the severity of warnings from his doctor. His closest emotional relationship is still with his car \u2013 a Saab almost as battered as he is \u2013 although there are encouraging signs of further reconciliation with his daughter.</p> <p>While some elements of Rebus are generic (troubles with drink and women), he is without doubt the funniest among the classic fictional detectives, and his 19th case features some fine one-liners and a satisfying gag involving a bossy colleague's stapler. <em>Standing in Another Man's Grave</em> is a less convoluted puzzle than many of the Rebus novels (the solution becomes decipherable relatively early), but it is Rankin's most interesting book politically, marking a vital stage in the consideration of Scottish nationalist sentiment that has been a constant background to the series.</p> <p>Although this book has only one direct reference to the prospect of independence, it is steeped in the feeling of a country on the cusp of potentially radical change. Because the disappearances are connected by a trunk route \u2013 and relatives and suspects have moved or retired to distant parts of Scotland \u2013 the novel has the structure of a road movie, with Rebus repeatedly cajoling his straining Saab around the nation: to Glasgow, Aberdeen, Aviemore, Inverness, Cape Wrath and, ultimately, the Black Isle peninsula in the far north where dolphins are seen in the sea.</p> <p>Obscure or poetically named locations are a motif in the book. At one point, \"Inchnadamph\" is flagged up as a potential crime scene by a cop who is accused by Edinburgh colleagues of having made it up to tease them. And, on one of his epic criss-crossings, Rebus notes \"signposts pointing him to places he would most likely never visit, such as the Waltzing Waters and Killiecrankie\".</p> <p>Pointedly, during his tour, Rebus is reading a book about Scottish myths and legends; in a novel that says hello again to a beloved character, Rankin seems explicitly to be examining the prospect of Scots saying farewell to their past. On one of his trips to the northern coast, Rebus notes the landscape is unlikely to have changed in a thousand years. Later he is given a riff about the country he comes from: \"A nation of 5 million huddled together as if cowed by the elements and the immensity of the landscape surrounding them, clinging to notions of community and shared history.\"</p> <p>From this book, my guess is that Rebus \u2013 if the polling station is close enough to a pub or distillery \u2013 will vote no in Alex Salmond's referendum, with the younger Clarke saying yes. Cheeringly, it seems clear from the final pages that there will be more Rebus books to chart the next stage in Scotland's story.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Lawson's <em>Enough Is Enough </em>is published by Picador.</p>",

  "<p>The government's cuts to child benefit could cost a family with three young children more than \u00a350,000 by the time the children reach the age of 18, according to analysis by accountants PwC.</p> <p>The firm's calculations are based on a family with three children aged five, three and one, where at least one partner earns \u00a360,000 or more. The analysis runs from when the cuts are implemented in January 2013 to the youngest child reaching his or her 18th birthday.</p> <p>The calculations also incorporate PwC projections of consumer price inflation and long-term inflation expectations, based on the Bank of England's target inflation rate of 2% per annum. Families with two children aged one and three stand to lose nearly \u00a340,000 over the same time period.</p> <p>Child benefit payments are tax-free and amount to \u00a320.30 a week for the first child and \u00a313.40 for each subsequent child.</p> <p>More than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/04/child-benefit-proposals-self-assesment-tax\" title=\"\">a million families are about to start receiving letters</a> from HMRC telling them they will lose some or all of the child benefit they currently receive.</p> <p>From January 2013 households receiving child benefit where one parent or partner earns more than \u00a350,000 will be hit with a new income tax charge. This tax, applied at the rate of 1% of the amount of child benefit for each \u00a3100 of income between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000, means that those earning above \u00a360,000 will effectively receive no benefit at all.</p> <p>Alex Henderson, tax partner at PwC, said: \"Many people affected by the child benefit cuts have probably not considered what the true cost will be to them over time. Our projections show the cost could be substantial, and could ultimately mean many middle-income families have to work longer until retirement or until they can pay back debts.\"</p> <p>Those parents still wanting to receive child benefit will also face the burden of filling in a self-assessment tax return, regardless of whether they pay income tax through PAYE.</p> <p>The Treasury says that 85% of all families with children will be unaffected by the cuts, which are targeted at higher income families in the UK.</p> <p>However, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has pointed out that families whose main earner has moved overseas to work \u2013 and whose earnings are taxed abroad \u2013 will not face the same loss of benefit. HMRC says only the income of the person living in the UK will be taken into account when it decides whether a household's child benefit should be reduced.</p> <p>Some media sources have also reported the changes may be illegal under EU law because it could lead to discrimination between some EU citizens working in the UK, with some facing the cuts while others working in the same job do not.</p> <p>However, HMRC has insisted the legislation was \"fully compliant with EU law\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2012/nov/01/child-benefit-changes-live-clinic\">Child benefit changes: live clinic \u2013 put your questions to our expert panel</a></p>",

The US government alleges that Megaupload, once one of the world's most popular websites, was directly responsible for illegally uploaded content on the site and that it netted $175m from unlawful activities. \"The new Mega will not be threatened by US prosecutors,\" Dotcom said, adding that he was confident Mega would avoid violating US law. \"The new Mega avoids any dealings with US hosters, US domains and US backbone providers and has changed the way it operates to avoid another takedown.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398678292\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351750761012/A-screen-grab-from-the-Me-008.jpg\" alt=\"A screen grab from the Megaupload preview page\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screen grab from the Mega preview page.

  "<p>Almost half of English councils would have twice as many claimants than they have properties that are affordable on benefits alone by 2017 because of government welfare cuts \u2013 with low-income families faced with choice of cutting spending on essentials such as food or moving out, according to the government spending watchdog.</p> <p>In a review into housing benefit reforms, the National Audit Office says that within five years 48% of England's 275 local authorities would have more than twice as many benefit claimants as two-bedroom dwellings, the most popular housing stock, available to rent.</p> <p>In January the government capped housing benefit payments, so that on a two-bedroom home the maximum benefit payable would be \u00a3250 a week. The allowances are also being scaled back by pegging them to the bottom third of rents in any borough \u2013 and then from next April benefits will rise more slowly than rents.</p> <p>The result is that in many towns and cities there will not be enough affordable homes to rent for those claiming local housing allowance, the benefit paid to tenants of private landlords.</p> <p>The NAO warns: \"More households would need to top up rents from other sources. Households in areas with larger shortfalls in 'affordable' private housing will face strong incentives to move to areas with smaller shortfalls or surpluses.\"</p> <p>The figures back up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jan/01/housing-benefits-cuts-rents-study\" title=\"\">a study commissioned</a> by the Guardian earlier this year from the Chartered Institute of Housing which calculated that a further 800,000 homes will be put out of reach of people on housing benefit because of the reforms \u2013 raising the possibility that the poor will have to migrate to \"benefit ghettoes\" in seaside towns or the north of England.</p> <p>Gavin Smart, director of policy at the institute, said: \"People will be forced to choose between buying food, paying rent or taking on unaffordable credit.</p> <p>\"It's a slow burn effect as the NAO report confirms. In a few years our cities could become very strange places where in many parts of them you will only find the very rich and well-paid.\"</p> <p>Five million low income households across Britain depend on housing benefit to afford somewhere to live \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/22/working-people-housing-benefit-report\" title=\"\">and the working poor are increasingly reliant on the welfare payment as rents rise faster than incomes.</a> The NAO says that the government's plans to cut the annual housing benefit bill by \u00a32.3bn by 2015 will lead to around two million of the poorest households receiving lower benefits.</p> <p>The watchdog warns that the government's impact assessments as yet \"do not reflect the full scale of potential impacts from the reforms\".</p> <p>Margaret Hodge, Labour chair of the powerful public accounts committee, said she was \"astonished that the department of work and pensions still does not understand the wider impacts of these changes. Cuts in payments will add uncertainty and increased hardship to the lives of individuals who are already struggling to get by. There is a real risk of increased homelessness, which on top of the human cost will simply transfer costs to other public services.\"</p> <p>The report is critical of the government's putative safety net scheme made up of \u00a3390m for local authorities to hand to households which find themselves in financial trouble because of the cuts.</p> <p>\"It is not clear how the overall level of funding has been determined or whether it is likely to be sufficient to tackle the effects of reforms\".</p> <p>Labour's Liam Byrne MP, shadow work and pensions secretary, pointed out that even Tory-run boroughs like Westminster were \"warning of increased use of inappropriate bed and breakfast accommodation\" because of rising homelessness.</p> <p>\"Today's report is fresh evidence of the chaos at DWP. David Cameron needs to get a grip and introduce the crucial safeguards we proposed to stop evictions unless someone can be offered somewhere else to live. Unbelievably nearly half of councils now face a housing shortfall that is getting worse. Incredibly the National Audit Office tells us that ministers haven't even bothered to set up any kind of systems that might flag things going wrong \u2013 or whether any savings are being made.\"</p> <p>The DWP said its research commissioned from Sheffield Hallam University reported that \"of those benefit claimants that have moved \u2014 few claimants gave finance-related reasons for the move from their previous accommodation and hardly any mentioned cuts in benefit\" and that in London a third of claimants had chosen to look for a job to make up a housing shortfall.</p> <p>A departmental spokesperson said: \"Our reforms will ensure that people on benefits can no longer live in expensive areas that working families not on benefits couldn't afford.</p> <p>\"Even with our reforms, housing benefit will meet rents of up to \u00a321,000 a year and apart from the most expensive areas in London around a third of properties will still be available to rent.</p> <p>\"We are providing an additional discretionary fund of \u00a3190m to help families in difficult situations. Our reforms restore fairness to a system that was left to spiral out of control.\"</p>"
