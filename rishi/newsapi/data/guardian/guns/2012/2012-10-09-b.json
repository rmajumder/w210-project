  "<p>Nothing illustrates the transformation of party conferences in the modern era more dramatically than the eclipse of the Conservative conference law and order debate. Until a decade or so ago, the hour-long rage-fest was the party's annual X-certificate moment. A pumped-up session full of calls by delegates for hanging and corporal punishment provided a high-risk yearly ordeal for Tory home secretaries. Some&#xa0;of them loathed it. Others loved it. None&#xa0;could ignore it.</p> <p>Tuesday afternoon's session in Birmingham&#xa0;showed the scale of the change. The same hall that had been packed for the Boris Johnson&#xa0;show earlier in the day was now half full. The home secretary made a speech, followed by the police minister and the justice&#xa0;secretary. All were politely applauded. No one spoke from the floor, because floor speeches are no longer allowed. The atmosphere was flat. And that was that.</p> <p>Well, almost. Some things haven't changed. Twenty years after Tony Blair led Labour on to law and order territory, the Tories still regard home affairs as their issue, not Labour's. Like so many of their predecessors, Theresa May and Chris Grayling therefore came to the conference hall armed with combative rhetoric and new announcements: <a href=\"http://www.cpc12.org.uk/Speeches/Theresa_May.aspx\" title=\"\">Mrs May</a> with the news that victims of antisocial behaviour will be able to choose the form of community punishment imposed on the offender, <a href=\"http://www.cpc12.org.uk/Speeches/Chris_Grayling.aspx\" title=\"\">Mr Grayling</a> with his well-trailed tougher community sentences and his permission to \"batter a burglar\" (<a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4579182/Its-official-You-can-batter-a-burglar.html\" title=\"\">as the Sun's front page put it</a>), as well as yet another extension of life sentences.</p> <p>Yet neither of the ministers' speeches should be dismissed as an echo of the past. Kenneth Clarke may have been replaced by a man who wants to be known as a tough justice minister \u2013 though when did anyone promise to be a weak one? \u2013 but Mr Grayling's comments on the need to break the cycle of deprivation, disadvantage and reoffending could have been delivered by the most liberal of penal reformers. Meanwhile, Mrs May's insistence on the necessity of police reform was a welcome contrast with Labour's taste for opportunist slipstreaming behind the police unions.</p> <p>This is not to give the two speeches or coalition priorities a free pass. Both Labour and the Tories are overly fond of irrelevant tough gestures \u2013 like violence against burglars \u2013 at the expense of effective social and criminal justice policies. The coalition nevertheless deserves credit for taking aspects of police and penal reform more seriously than previous governments have done. The fact that reform is largely being driven by cost rather than conviction remains secondary to the encouraging fact that some much-needed things are being done at all.</p>",
  "<p>It was never entirely clear if we were being invited to celebrate Jewish mothers in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/jewish-mum-of-the-year\" title=\"\"><strong>Jewish Mum of the Year</strong></a> (Channel 4) or laugh at them. The official line was that it was a celebration, dreamed up by the editor of the Jewish News to find a standard bearer who could combine the very best of modern and traditional Jewish motherhood and who was, in the words of Professor Dovid Katz, \"an emblem of unswerving devotion\". But that's to ignore the Jewish sense of humour \u2026</p> <p>It was also never entirely clear how the programme had picked its eight contestants, though it looked very much as if the producers had gone out of their way to find extreme examples of every Jewish stereotype: the bling princess, the control freak, the ultra orthodox, the smotherer, the delusional, the neurotic. As an advert for most people's idea of a mother from hell it couldn't have been bettered and was undeniably good fun to watch \u2013 so long as you weren't one of the eight women, who gave every impression of believing they had entered a serious competition.</p> <p>The format of the show is that each week the mothers are paired up and given a different task, with two of them being eliminated each week. First up was organising the bar mitzvah for a boy named Ben: \"Remember,\" warned Dovid, \"that this is all about Ben.\" As if. The show would have been dead in the water as entertainment if it had been, but fortunately our eight mums ignored this advice, understanding full well that this occasion was actually all about them and set about trying to outdo one another while appearing to be co-operative.</p> <p>By far the most entertaining pairing was Emma, the bling princess, and Ruth, the dour ultra orthodox, whose job was to organise a photo booth and party bags, and who couldn't agree on anything \u2013 not even how much they disliked each other. The largest chunk of the programme was devoted to their inevitable car crash of a contribution. Come the big day, the party bags were unfinished and Emma was left screaming at the kids to grab what they&#xa0;could.</p> <p>Had this been a real contest, Emma and Ruth would have been eliminated on the spot but, as they were great box office, they lived to fight another day. Instead, Louisa was kicked out for the faux pas of serving gazpacho, which seemed a little harsh. Why couldn't the judges have just been honest and booted her off for being incredibly annoying? They could also have got rid of Jacqueline for much the same reason, but instead chose Tracy, one of the two vaguely stable women on show. Not only was Tracy quite happy to knock up a cake out of a packet mix but she had a healthy disregard for Heston Blumenthal's efforts to improve it. My kind of mum.</p> <p>Then again, maybe my own ideas of parenting have room for improvement, as I wouldn't have minded that much if either of my kids had turned out like any of the Hartnell Avenue students in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/fresh-meat\" title=\"\"><strong>Fresh Meat</strong></a> (Channel 4), which returned for a second series. One of the things that makes this show work so well is that it's actually a soppy sitcom \u2013 with more than a hint of romcom \u2013 with the comedy stemming from the characters gauche attempts to project themselves as hard and knowing when the reality is they are anything but.</p> <p>All the characters are much as we left them. Kingsley has grown an apology for a goatee, but otherwise his and Josie's on-off relationship is still on-off, Vod is still on the scrounge, Oregon is still trying not to be posh and JP is still \u2026 Jack Whitehall. I'm not convinced there's a difference between Whitehall and any of the characters he plays, but for the time being that doesn't really matter as he is rather good at being whoever he is. Writers Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong also appear to have written out the show's major weakness \u2013 geology lecturer Dan \u2013 and introduced Giles and Sabine to make sure the meat stays fresh. A&#xa0;comedy that's actually funny. It could catch on.</p> <p>The laughs have been fading away from <a href=\"http://skyatlantic.sky.com/shows/nurse-jackie\" title=\"\"><strong>Nurse Jackie</strong></a> (Sky Atlantic) for some time now as the show gets darker and darker but it remains compelling, primarily for the central performances of Edie Falco and Eve Best. The new series opened with Jackie doing her best to destroy what few relationships she had left and ending up in rehab. A&#xa0;comedy that turns into a drama. That could also catch on.</p>",
  "<p>Having written plays about the Suez crisis and Thatcher's childhood, James Graham now turns his attention to the Labour government's precarious ability to survive a hung parliament and a wafer-thin majority from 1974 to 1979. This is a play about the daily process of politics rather than big ideas, but it recreates, with startling vividness, the madness of life in the Westminster village during five action-filled years.</p> <p>The audience sits on replica Commons benches but Graham's focus is not on the debates but on the wheeling and dealing that goes on in the offices of Labour and Tory whips. In February 1974, after Heath has been ousted, Labour forms a minority government and we see Bob Mellish and his fellow whips offering sweeteners to the Liberals, the Scot Nats and the Northern Irish in order to stay in power. But, although Labour ends up with a slender majority of three after the October 1974 election, things get rougher and tougher. The party changes leader in mid-stream, the Tories cancel all pairing agreements after alleged cheating, fighting breaks out in the Commons, the sick and dying are wheeled in to vote. This, incredibly, is British democracy in action.</p> <p>For all that, Graham's play adds up to an implicit endorsement of the system: when Humphrey Atkins, the Tory chief whip, reminds his new opposite number, Michael Cocks, that the gap between government and opposition benches is exactly the width of two drawn swords, it sounds like a recommendation of adversarial politics. Identifying MPs by their constituencies, Graham also suggests that, in the days before expenses scandals, they honourably performed an unglamorous task. Above all, the play unlocks a whole era and reminds those alive in the 1970s of the volatility of the period's politics: Michael Heseltine swings the mace in the Commons, a Labour MP carefully stages his own disappearance, another is ready to bring down the government when the chancellor proposes over \u00a31bn worth of spending cuts.</p> <p>That is a rare excursion into policy. Mostly the play is about pragmatic survival and my only complaint is that Graham gives the impression that dodgy parliamentary arithmetic virtually crippled the business of government. It's perfectly true that Labour had to go cap in hand to the IMF in 1976 during a sterling crisis. But the late 1970s wasn't all bad news: inflation and unemployment fell, progressive legislation, such as the Sex Discrimination Act, was passed, and it was widely assumed that if James Callaghan had called an election in 1978, Labour could still have won.</p> <p>But Jeremy Herrin's production recaptures, with abundant theatricality, accompanying music and choreographed movement, the mayhem of Westminster politics. And, in a large cast, Philip Glenister, Vincent Franklin and Andrew Frame as working-class Labour whips, Julian Wadham, Charles Edwards and Ed Hughes as their smooth-suited Tory equivalents and Christopher Godwin and Rupert Vansittart amongst the role-swapping ensemble are outstanding. It may be a bit of an anoraks' night out but, as a relic of the period, I had a thoroughly good time.</p> <p>\u2022 Until 1 December. Box Office: 020 7452 3000</p>",
  "<p>At some time or another, we have all sat with a friend and heard them come out with a quip we would rather they'd kept to themselves. Whether the remark was too cold, too cruel or simply too revolting, you might have meekly giggled along. Perhaps you glanced down, and quietly thought less of your companion. Or perhaps you plucked up the sort of courage, too rare in England, to tell them what you thought. Whatever you did, it is a fair guess that you didn't pick up the phone to the police with a view to starting criminal proceedings.</p> <p>Maybe the worst \"joke\" to have polluted your ear was not as offensive as those posted on Facebook by Matthew Woods, about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-19880689\" title=\"\">the missing five-year-old April Jones</a>. It could scarcely have been worse; yet such nastiness is not exceptional in playgrounds or pubs. It is only because this callous sub-comedy happened online that Woods is starting a 12-week prison term. A <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/contents\" title=\"\">statute of 2003</a>, which has since been overtaken by the technologies it polices, took a form of bad behaviour previously dealt with through social censure, and criminalised it on the net. That context was then still a novelty, for parliamentarians at least. MPs and peers, who a few years later took <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4664398.stm\" title=\"\">a brave stand</a> against Tony Blair's cavalier plans to ban insulting and ridiculing words about religion, probably hazily imagined some freaky Californian practice when they enacted <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127\" title=\"\">section 127</a>, which barred electronic messages of a \"grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\". They certainly would not have thought they were making nasty banter something their constituents would indulge on pain of imprisonment. But that was before Twitter, and before Mark Zuckerberg had <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050403215543/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=357292\" title=\"\">created a site</a> that asked users to rate the attractiveness (or lack of it) of his unwitting fellow students. The unsavoury beginnings of the phenomenon that became Facebook underline that social networks are, first and foremost, a new outlet for the old human habit of amoral gossip.</p> <p>Most of it, of course, is not offensive enough to be affected by the act, but quite a variety of sins can be caught. This very week has also seen the sentencing of Azhar Ahmed in West Yorkshire, for expressing his anger about the war in Afghanistan, by posting on Facebook that soldiers should die and go to hell. He was not convicted because anyone believed he was actually soliciting violence, the traditional restraint on free speech (which, incidentally, proved perfectly adequate for jailing Abu Hamza), but merely because he had caused offence. Previously, there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/29/leader-freedom-of-speech\" title=\"\">Paul Chambers' conviction</a> for a jocular threat to blow Robin Hood airport sky high, made while he moaned about expected delays. His successful appeal produced <a href=\"http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2012/07/27/twitter-users-free-to-speak-not-what-they-ought-to-say-but-what-they-feel/\" title=\"\">a judgment</a> which emphasised that jokes in poor taste would not ordinarily result in a conviction.</p> <p>But Woods's guilty plea, made on legal advice, shows how ambiguity lingers. Like the lord chief justice in the Chambers case, the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, is usefully attempting to narrow the circumstances in which the law will be applied \u2013 using his decision not to pursue a homophobic tweet from footballer Daniel Thomas as occasion to <a href=\"http://blog.cps.gov.uk/2012/09/dpp-statement-on-tom-daley-case-and-social-media-prosecutions.html\" title=\"\">consult on guidelines</a> about when charges should be pressed.</p> <p>The DPP has sensible first thoughts on where charges should be more likely \u2013 hostile tweets or posts that, for instance, victimise, exhibit racism, or amount to a credible threat. But he is properly at pains to stress that he can only implement the law as it is written. It is hard to imagine any guidelines that will remove the controversy, however. Should Martin Amis, for instance, have tweeted his confessions about an urge for Muslims to suffer rather than communicating it in other ways, would he, too, have been prosecuted? Should he have been? The obvious answer ought to be no, but it is not obvious from fuzzy legislation which powerless angry young men like Ahmed have every right to believe will instead be applied unfairly against them. In the end the solution will have to be rewriting or even repealing, as opposed to reinterpreting, this law.</p>",
  "<p>Brendan Rodgers has taken exception to Alan Shearer's analysis of Joe Allen and believes it shows the former England striker does not grasp how his Liverpool team operate.</p> <p>The Wales international has been one of Liverpool's better performers this season but was recently criticised on Match of the Day by Shearer for being too safe in possession and not attempting enough penetrating passes. That has prompted a staunch defence of Allen from the Liverpool manager, who paid \u00a315m for the midfielder to follow him from Swansea City to Anfield this summer, and a comparison to Paul Scholes's role for Manchester United.</p> <p>\"I saw someone recently criticising Joe Allen for not playing risk passes. Unbelievable. So-called pundits who don't know the dynamics of a team and how it functions,\" said Rodgers. \"Joe's role is to keep the ball and that, in Britain, is a special talent. It is why Paul Scholes is still playing at his age. It is such a rare talent for a midfielder to rarely give the ball away.\"</p> <p>The Liverpool manager is irked at the portrayal of Allen's conservatism when the 22-year-old has been moved into a defensive role as a result of injury to Lucas Leiva and for the balance of the team.</p> <p>Rodgers explained: \"Initially when I came in, we played with one holding midfielder and two advanced ones. I didn't feel that we had the guy that opened the door for everything so I played Joe in there because he knows how to control the game. He is courageous and will go and get the ball in any area. But our positioning ahead of that wasn't so good, because we were too open. We have switched the team to play with two holding midfielders and one further forward. That has been Steven more or less, because he is the one that can do everything.\"</p> <p>The Liverpool manager is adamant Allen will play a more prominent offensive role when Lucas returns from a thigh injury next month. He added: \"Joe, offensively, has more than what a lot of people have seen, just because he's had to play more of a sitting role. That comes when Lucas is back.</p> <p>\"Where we have been really pleased with Joe is with his tactical discipline. Maybe he's never going to score as many as Steven but he's certainly got quality going forward. But his tactical discipline to stay and keep the shape of the team, and offer the passing line, has been very good. He will have a long career here, he's a wonderful talent and over time people will see what facets he's got in his game. Over time he will prove an absolute bargain.\"</p>",
  "<p>The director of public prosecutions is exploring whether Facebook and Twitter should take more responsibility for policing their networks for abuse and harassment in an attempt to reduce the number of cases coming to court.</p> <p>On Monday a 12-week jail sentence was handed out to Matthew Woods, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/08/april-jones-matthew-woods-jailed?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">teenager who made \"sick jokes\" on Facebook</a> about the missing five-year-old April Jones. On Tuesday a Dewsbury man was sentenced for writing an abusive post about the deaths of British soldiers.</p> <p>Keir Starmer, who is this week consulting with lawyers, journalists and police in a series of seminars on the subject, is keen to ask if social media companies should improve their site moderation at a time when police are concerned about the volume of offensive posts and tweets they may be called to investigate.</p> <p>Those attending the panels said Starmer frequently returned to the subject, and he is preparing to draw up guidelines against an almost daily backdrop of arrests, prosecutions and controversy. But there is no immediate consensus on what greater self-regulation for social media would look like.</p> <p>On Tuesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/09/community-sentence-facebook-dead-soldiers\" title=\"\">Azhar Ahmed, 20, from Dewsbury, was sentenced to 240 hours of community service</a> for a Facebook post saying \"all soldiers should die and go to hell\" following the deaths of six British soldiers. A day earlier Matthew Woods, 19 and from Chorley, was jailed for 12 weeks for posting the jokes on his Facebook page.</p> <p>The growing number of arrests \u2013 often under the expansive section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act, which makes it an offence to send or post \"grossly offensive\" material online \u2013 is prompting concerned police to lobby Starmer to keep the bar on prosecutions high.</p> <p>Last month the CPS decided not to take action against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/dpp-prosecutions-facebook-twitter-abuse\" title=\"\">Daniel Thomas, a semi-professional footballer who posted homophobic messages on Twitter relating to the Olympic diver Tom Daley,</a> because he apologised quickly, deleted the message, and said he did not intend it to be retweeted as widely as it was.</p> <p>Section 127 deals only with messages sent over the internet and was used by the authorities in the infamous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/27/twitter-joke-trial-high-court\" title=\"\">Twitter joke trial</a>, in which Paul Chambers eventually had his conviction overturned after tweeting in frustration about his local airport in South Yorkshire being snowbound. \"Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed,\" Chambers wrote. \"You've got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!!\"</p> <p>David Allen Green, one of Chambers's legal team and head of media at Preiskel &amp; Co, said there could be a risk that what is said online is more circumscribed than what would be said in print, on television or in the street.</p> <p>\"There is therefore a serious question as to whether communications should be criminalised because they are in electronic form, which would not lead to an offence otherwise,\" he added. But the CPS is understood to be content with the law and is not recommending that it be changed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, police are worried about the time spent examining cases and that it will only be practicable to investigate a handful of cases where emotions are running high \u2013 such as in last month's arrest of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2206043/Neil-Swinburne-22-arrested-Dale-Cregan-Facebook-tribute-page.html\" title=\"\">the Liverpool man who is alleged to have set up a \"Dale Cregan is a hero\"</a> page, referring to the suspect now charged with the murder of two Greater Manchester police officers and two civilians.</p> <p>Andy Trotter, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on media issues, said: \"Many offensive comments are made every day on social media and guidance will assist the police to focus on the most serious matters.\"</p> <p>Police would like Facebook and Twitter to act faster in deleting offensive comments to avoid arrests being necessary and to see if it is possible to explore ways of blocking particular individuals from using their networks.</p> <p>Twitter declined to comment on individual cases and Starmer's work directly. The social network has a free speech policy that means it does not interfere in disputes or restrict what it describes as \"controversial content\", advising people to block users that people disagree with. But Twitter did recently change its rules to make \"direct, repeated attacks on an individual a possible violation\" of its terms of service.</p> <p>A Facebook spokesman said the network was heavily reliant on policing by its global network of one billion users, any of whom can report abuse to a team of unspecified size based in Dublin. Facebook has said it takes down pages \"very quickly\", although it does not supply any details of how many complaints it gets in the UK, or how fast it works. But with regard to the Cregan case, the network said it was able to remove pages set up by people with false identities, which is a breach of its terms and conditions.</p> <p>Allen Green said there was an argument for Twitter and Facebook to operate in a more easily understood way in this area.</p> <p>\"If social media platforms had a more responsible and transparent form of removing content, then it would be likely that there would be less recourse to either civil or criminal law,\" the lawyer said.</p>",
  "<p>The Lotus team principal, Eric Boullier, has said Romain Grosjean must solve the problems that have led to a host of accidents this year.</p> <p>Grosjean has been involved in eight incidents this season, with five on the first lap, including the huge crash that put Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton out at Spa and resulted in a one-race ban.</p> <p>The reaction after he punted Mark Webber out in Japan on Sunday was widespread, negative and strongly suggestive that action against the driver should be taken. Webber himself branded him a \"nutcase\"; the Red Bull principal, Christian Horner, said that it was \"unacceptable\" and that \"his team need to get him under a bit more control\"; while Jenson Button said he should \"sort his shit out\".</p> <p>\"We can work with him,\" Boullier said. \"I speak to him. We try to create a tough environment because I need to push him, [but] he has to find it within himself, nobody else can do that. He understands what he did wrong. He has to because that needs to be fixed. We can just help him, but we cannot fix it.\"</p> <p>Grosjean is a quick driver and has put his car in the front five of the grid six times this season but has also gained a reputation for what Button described as being a \"win or crash\" driver, which Boullier also acknowledged. \"If you look at his career, he was always a little bit hot [hot-headed driver] but I thought if he got some confidence, then he would cool down. He [has] won championships before. That means he knows how to start a race and win a race. The only worry is to make sure he cools down.\"</p> <p>What little patience there was will have been further tested after Boullier's comments, because he is not only the French driver's boss but also effectively his manager, since the team principal is chief executive of Gravity Sports Management, which looks after the driver, and Boullier was personally instrumental in bringing him to Lotus.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the driver's seat for 2013 is not at risk, or at least Boullier said: \"Not yet. But I expect to see an improvement,\" while insisting that it was up to Grosjean to find ways improve. \"He needs to find what makes him relaxed and how to be good and to concentrate on the right person. He needs to find that balance. It is not about fixing things like the car setup, it is about trying to make the kid confident and self-aware so that he controls his starts.\"</p> <p>Grosjean acknowledged ahead of the next race, here in South Korea on Sunday, that he would be under scrutiny and that he had to do better. \"It was a stupid mistake,\" he said. \"Mark [Webber] came to see me after the race and was obviously not happy, but I apologised and we have to move on. I've sat down and looked at things again with the team; it's still an area we need to improve. We're clearly focusing on this area for the next races.\"</p> <p>Boullier added: \"We have been speaking to him, especially since Spa. I think he will eventually learn.\" However, it is the somewhat nebulous \"eventually\" that will concern many drivers, especially at the business end of the grid. With five races to go and only four points separating Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel in the world championship, a potentially thrilling end to the season may be ruined should either be knocked out in Korea at the first corner.</p> <p>Alonso's principal, Stefano Domenicali, meanwhile, has admitted his team must push development harder if they are to match Red Bull in the fight for the title. \"We need to think differently now, because that race advantage is not there. But it [the title fight] is still in our control,\" he said.</p> <p>With the points cushion Alonso had enjoyed until his failures to finish in Belgium and Japan now gone, Domenicali noted that it was imperative Ferrari move up the grid. \"We saw Red Bull this weekend was impressive, so we need to see what we can do to match their development \u2013 or see if this track was better for them. We need to keep the positive pressure on our engineers to make sure we deliver the development,\" he said. \"When I hear that we have not developed the car for many grands prix, it is not true. The truth is that the level of development is very high, but we need to start higher because when you start there [in the middle of the grid] anything can happen.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has privately met members of the Hacked Off campaign, which was formed in response to the hacking scandal. He told them that he is open to the idea of statutory underpinning for effective regulation of the press.</p> <p>Charlotte Church, the singer who was a victim of phone hacking and was part of a delegation of the campaign, revealed the conversation at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham on Tuesday.</p> <p>There have been rumours that Cameron is preparing to reject statutory intervention in the regulation of the press even if it is strongly recommended by Lord Justice Leveson when he reports next month.</p> <p>Church said after meeting Cameron that she had \"faith\" he would accept the recommendations from the Leveson report, with a new system of regulation \"which we the public can trust and is not controlled by the editors. I found that very comforting,\" she said.</p> <p>The Hacked Off campaign is in favour of an independent system of regulation, with a minimum statutory underpinning to ensure the standards of the regulator set up do not slip and that all newspaper editors are signed up to the new code.</p> <p>Church said Cameron seemed open to the idea of a statutory backstop: \"The prime minister seemed open to the idea of statutory underpinning but was very opposed to the idea of having massive amounts of statutory legislation for everybody to follow&#xa0;\u2026 which is not what Hacked Off want either.</p> <p>\"We are absolutely advocates of free speech and want freedom of expression to continue but they just need to be watched because it has gone out of control over a long period of time. But it's important to say the prime minister was open-minded about statutory underpinning. It's not about us being excessive.\"</p> <p>If Cameron subsequently rejected the demands of the campaign, it would leave the victims \"unbelievably disappointed\", she said.</p> <p>Church, who said her own story \"paled\" next to those recounted by ordinary people, warned: \"It would be doing the biggest injustice to them after this long inquiry, which public money has gone into.</p> <p>\"We have established wrongdoing, that there needs to some changes made, and we just went in there to make sure \u2026 that it wasn't all in vain.\"</p>",
  "<p>The transformation of Latin America is one of the decisive changes reshaping the global order. The tide of progressive change that has swept the region over the last decade has brought a string of elected socialist and social-democratic governments to office that have redistributed wealth and power, rejected western neoliberal orthodoxy, and challenged imperial domination. In the process they have started to build the first truly independent South America for 500 years and demonstrated to the rest of the world that there are, after all, economic and social alternatives in the 21st century.</p> <p>Central to that process has been Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_Revolution\" title=\"\">Bolivarian revolution</a> in Venezuela. It is Venezuela, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/venezuela-election-result-oil-politics\" title=\"\">sitting on the world's largest proven oil reserves</a>, that has spearheaded the movement of radical change across Latin America and underwritten the regional integration that is key to its renaissance. By doing so, the endlessly vilified Venezuelan leader has earned the enmity of the US and its camp followers, as well as the social and racial elites that have called the shots in Latin America for hundreds of years.</p> <p>So Ch\u00e1vez's remarkable presidential election victory on Sunday \u2013 in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2012/oct/09/venezuela-election-results-map-open-data\" title=\"\">he won 55% of the vote on an 81% turnout after 14 years in power</a> \u2013 has a significance far beyond Venezuela, or even Latin America. The stakes were enormous: if his oligarch challenger <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19858755\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a> had won, not only would the revolution have come to a juddering halt, triggering privatisations and the axing of social programmes. So would its essential support for continental integration, mass sponsorship of Cuban doctors across the hemisphere \u2013 as well as Ch\u00e1vez's plans to reduce oil dependence on the US market.</p> <p>Western and Latin American media and corporate elites had convinced themselves that they were at last in with a shout, that this election was \"too close to call\", or even that a failing Venezuelan president, weakened by cancer, would at last be rejected by his own people. Outgoing World Bank president <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-08/world-bank-chief-zoellick-says-chavez-s-days-are-numbered\" title=\"\">Robert Zoellick crowed that Ch\u00e1vez's days were \"numbered\"</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-08/chavez-win-called-by-bofa-points-to-bond-rout-as-barclays-flops\" title=\"\">Barclays let its excitement run away with itself by calling the election for Capriles</a>.</p> <p>It's all of a piece with the endlessly recycled Orwellian canard that Ch\u00e1vez is some kind of a dictator and Venezuela a tyranny where elections are rigged and the media muzzled and prostrate. But as opposition leaders concede, Venezuela is by any rational standards a democracy, with exceptionally high levels of participation, its electoral process more fraud-proof than those in Britain or the US, and its media dominated by a vituperatively anti-government private sector. In reality, the greatest threat to Venezuelan democracy came in the form of the abortive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela\" title=\"\">US-backed coup of 2002</a>.</p> <p>Even senior western diplomats in Caracas roll their eyes at the absurdity of the anti-Ch\u00e1vez propaganda in the western media. And in the queues outside polling stations on Sunday, in the opposition stronghold of San Crist\u00f3bal near the Colombian border, Capriles voters told me: \"This is a democracy.\" Several claimed that if Ch\u00e1vez won, it wouldn't be because of manipulation of the voting system but the \"laziness\" and \"greed\" of their fellow Venezuelans \u2013 by which they seemed to mean the appeal of government social programmes.</p> <p>Which gets to the heart of the reason so many got the Venezuelan election wrong. Despite claims that Latin America's progressive tide is exhausted, leftwing and centre-left governments continue to be re-elected \u2013 from Ecuador to Brazil and Bolivia to Argentina \u2013 because they have reduced poverty and inequality and taken control of energy resources to benefit the excluded majority.</p> <p>That is what Ch\u00e1vez has been able to do on a grander scale, using Venezuela's oil income and publicly owned enterprises to slash <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/venezuela-2012-09.pdf\" title=\"\">poverty by half and extreme poverty by 70%</a>, massively expanding access to health and education, sharply boosting the minimum wage and pension provision, halving unemployment, and giving slum communities direct control over social programmes.</p> <p>To visit any rally or polling station during the election campaign was to be left in no doubt as to who Ch\u00e1vez represents: the poor, the non-white, the young, the disabled \u2013 in other words, the dispossessed majority who have again returned him to power. Euphoria at the result among the poor was palpable: in the foothills of the Andes on Monday groups of red-shirted hillside farmers chanted and waved flags at any passerby.</p> <p>Of course there is also no shortage of government failures and weaknesses which the opposition was able to target: from runaway violent crime to corruption, lack of delivery and economic diversification, and over-dependence on one man's charismatic leadership. And the <a href=\"http://transition.usaid.gov/performance/cbj/158267.pdf\" title=\"\">US-financed opposition campaign</a> was a much more sophisticated affair than in the past. Capriles presented himself as \"centre-left\", despite his hard right background, and promised to maintain some Chavista social programmes.</p> <p>But even so, the Venezuelan president ended up almost 11 points ahead. And the opposition's attempt to triangulate to the left only underlines the success of&#xa0;Ch\u00e1vez in changing Venezuela's society and political terms of trade. He has shown himself to be the most electorally successful radical left leader in history. His re-election now gives him the chance to ensure Venezuela's transformation is deep enough to survive him, to overcome the administration's failures and help entrench the process of change across the continent.</p> <p>Venezuela's revolution doesn't offer a political model that can be directly transplanted elsewhere, not least because oil revenues allow it to target resources on the poor without seriously attacking the interests of the wealthy. But its innovative social programmes, experiments in direct democracy and success in bringing resources under public control offer lessons to anyone interested in social justice and new forms of socialist politics in the rest of the world.</p> <p>For all their problems and weaknesses, Venezuela and its Latin American allies have demonstrated that it's no longer necessary to accept a failed economic model, as many social democrats in Europe still do. They have shown it's possible to be both genuinely progressive and popular. Cynicism and media-fuelled ignorance have prevented many who would naturally identify with Latin America's transformation from recognising its significance. But Ch\u00e1vez's re-election has now ensured that the process will continue \u2013 and that the space for 21st-century alternatives will grow.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner's attempt to parachute to earth from the edge of space has been postponed for at least 48 hours after gusty winds in New Mexico hampered the launch of the balloon that would take him skywards.</p> <p>Baumgartner, a 43-year-old former soldier, was aiming to jump from 23 miles above the Earth in a specially pressurised suit, plummetting to the ground at speeds that would break the sound barrier before he triggers his parachute.</p> <p>Team spokeswoman Sarah Anderson later said no new launch attempt would be made before Thursday. She said Wednesday had been ruled out due to further weather concerns and to give the mission's support crew a day off.</p> <p>The stunt, if successful, would break five world records. Baumgartner would become the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; make the highest free-fall altitude jump, ride the highest manned balloon flight and longest free-fall and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history.</p> <p>Baumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of derring-do. The former paratrooper, known as \"Fearless Felix\" for reasons that need no explanation, has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. Baumgartner had already done two practise freefalls \u2013 one from 71,000 feet in March this year and a second from 97,000 feet in July.</p> <p>Tuesday's jump was due to take place far above an airfield near the town of Roswell, which is famous for its UFO sighting. All had appeared well as Baumgartner donned his special suit, climbed into the capsule and then waited for the balloon to inflate. \"I am strapped into the capsule and I am ready to go,\" he had told the stunt's mission control team.</p> <p>However, as the slivery balloon began to be inflated it was buffeted by heavy winds and the mission was postponed. Baumgartner, whose attempt is sponsored and run by the caffeinated drinks brand Red Bull, had postponed his first attempt on Monday, also after high winds.</p> <p>There was, unsurprisingly, little sign that he was contemplating giving up. On the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RedBullStratos\">mission's official Twitter feed</a>, Baumgartner issued a simple statement promising the attempt would go ahead at some stage. \"It's all about what we do now and accomplish now. We've made it so far, there's no way turning back,\" he said.</p> <p>If successful Baumgartner's feat will raise the prospect that stricken astronauts might be able to survive a disaster of the type that hit the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 by actually bailing out of their craft. Baumgartner's top medical man in the stunt is Dr Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts' chances of survival in a high-altitude disaster.</p>",
  "<p>Eleven people have now died from a fatal outbreak of meningitis, with 119 now sick with the illness, according to health officials. Experts said they could be seeing new cases as late as December, two months later than previously thought. It is long waiting game for some of the 13,000 people who may have received medication from the suspected source of the illness to get the all-clear.</p> <p>Some of the patients have had strokes as a result of the infection, but few details were available.</p> <p>Officials have linked the rare form of meningitis, which is not contagious, to a contaminated steroid injection produced by New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts. At least one contaminated vial was found at the company, in an ongoing investigation by the Food and Drug Administration.</p> <p>Up to 13,000 people may have received the steroid, commonly used as a spinal injection to treat back pain, from NECC between May 21 and September 25, the CDC said. It is unclear how many of the shots were infected, however. The figure includes not only people who got spinal injections, believed to be most at risk, but those who received injections in other parts of the body, such as knees or shoulders.</p> <p>Tennessee <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/meningitis-map.html\">remains the worst-affected state so far</a>, with 39 infections and six deaths to date. Four patients have died from the illness in Michigan, one in Maryland and one in Virginia.</p> <p>At a press conference on Tuesday, Dr John Dreyzehner said those who got the tainted shot might not show symptoms for up to three months later, according to <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=42011\">Nashville Public Radio</a>.</p> <p>Officials had thought people exposed to the contaminated steroid were in the clear after a month. Symptoms took on average 16 days to develop, but Dreyzehner said one case took 42 days. So, to be safe, the window for those looking out for symptoms could remain open as long as three months.</p> <p>Sue Manor, 66, of Hendersonville, spoke of her \"agonising\" wait for the all-clear. One of the Saint Thomas pain patients who received a steroid injection, Manor <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/09/spinal-tap-fungal-meningitis/1622323/\">told the (Nashville) Tennessean on Tuesday</a> that she became anxious and believed she had symptoms. </p> <p>\"I had a couple of days where I had a headache and my neck was stiff,\" she said. \"Intellectually, I knew it was stress bringing it on. But there is the slightest possibility \u2013 or even a good possibility \u2013 that it could be the early onset of meningitis on my system.\"</p> <p>By Monday, she said, she was feeling better, but, following Tuesday's warning, Manor may be among patients who have a longer wait for the all-clear than they first thought.</p> <p>Fungal meningitis is treated with high-dose anti-fungal medications, usually given intravenously in a hospital.</p> <p>A second kind of fungus is now thought to be the main culprit in the rapidly evolving outbreak. Officials first said the contamination was from a mold called Aspergilus. Now, state health commissioner Dreyzehner said they had identified a second variety.</p> <p>\"Our ongoing investigation indicates Exserohilum is the primary fungal infection affecting patients in Tennessee \u2013 a fungus so rare that most physicians never see it in a lifetime of practising medicine,\" he said.</p> <p>The antifungal medicine would still work against the second fungus, he said.</p> <p>An update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued on Tuesday afternoon, included New Jersey on the list of states in which at least one person has contracted the illness.</p> <p>Other states with confirmed cases includes Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina and Ohio.</p> <p>Officials from the FDA have told doctors, hospital and medical clinics to contact thousands of patients who may have received in infected dose to look out for symptoms.</p> <p>NECC recalled the preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate that was sent to clinics in 23 states and later recalled everything it makes.</p> <p>Last week, it surrendered its license to operate until the ongoing FDA investigation into the contamination is complete.</p> <p>Health officials say 75 medical facilities in 23 states received the contaminated steroid injections from NECC.</p> <p>Infected patients have developed a variety of symptoms including fever, new or worsening headache, nausea, and \"new neurological deficit [consistent with deep brain stroke],\" the CDC said in a news release. Some of these patients' symptoms were very mild in nature. Cerebrospinal fluid from these patients has shown findings consistent with meningitis, the agency said.</p>",

  "<p>Boris Johnson has ended a presidential-style tour of the Conservative conference by declaring that he would like to see the top rate of tax cut to 40%.</p> <p>In a signal to the Tory right, the London mayor said he would like to go further than George Osborne, who lowered the top rate from 50p to 45p in the budget.</p> <p>Asked on Sky News whether he favoured a further cut, Johnson said: \"In so far as it is significantly higher than other areas, then, yes, I would be in favour of moving towards lower tax rates.\"</p> <p>Johnson highlighted his support for tax cuts after a tub-thumping speech to the party conference in Birmingham in which he stressed his loyalty to the prime minister and indicated he would serve a full four-year term as mayor. There has been speculation that he might stand in the 2015 general election to place him in pole position to succeed Cameron as Tory leader.</p> <p>The mayor told Andrew Neil on the BBC's Daily Politics: \"Londoners have elected me for four years to deliver jobs and growth and do everything I can to get the city growing again and growing strongly and keep fighting crime and to deliver my manifesto.\"</p> <p>In his speech to the Tory conference, Johnson thanked activists who helped him to re-election as he outlined his achievements in the capital and the plans for his current term.</p> <p>\"You showed that we can overcome a Labour lead and win in the places which the two Eds are so cocky as to think that they own,\" said Johnson.</p> <p>Pointing to the smiling prime minister in the audience, he added: \"If we can win in a recession and wipe out a 17-point Labour lead, then I know that David Cameron will win in 2015, when the economy has turned round \u2013 and we are already seeing signs of progress \u2013 when people are benefiting from jobs and growth and the firm leadership you have shown and the tough decisions you have taken, not least coming along to hear this speech today.\"</p> <p>Giving his backing to the government's austerity programme, he drew on the success of the \"can do\" attitude of the Olympics to take the country forward, with British firms becoming \"gold medal winners\".</p> <p>\"Just as we all fought together this year to keep London from lurching back into the grip of a cabal of semi-Marxists and tax-funded Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape-swilling tax minimisers \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 and car-hating bendy-bus fetishists, I will join you in the fight to keep this country from lurching back into the grip of the two Eds \u2013 Balls and Miliband.</p> <p>\"Unreformed, under-punished, unrepentant about what they did to the economy and for the deficit that they racked up.

Tommy described being visited by a man who said he was campaigning for Boris Johnson and told him that if he backed H&amp;F's controversial plan to demolish the estate and its neighbour Gibbs Green he would be \"picked first\" for a replacement home in a new development in nearby <a href=\"http://www.myearlscourt.com/seagrave-road/\">Seagrave Road</a>.</p> <p>The particular significance of this is that the plan for the Seagrave Road site includes only the first 200 of a promised 760 homes that would replace those of the two estates within a proposed redevelopment of the wider area, known as the <a href=\"http://www.myearlscourt.com/the-future/project_area/\">Earls Court project</a> \u2013 an ambitious, 77-acre enterprise that H&amp;F's developer partner Capco estimates could eventually be worth \u00a38 billion. </p> <p>The advantage of being included on any so-called \"early movers list\" or \"VIP list\" relating to Seagrave Road \u2013 the council denies that one exists - is that those on it would be settled in their new homes away from the estates before their destruction and any ensuing new building began. In other words, they wouldn't have to live in the middle of a demolition or construction site for years, maybe many of them. </p> <p>Tommy doesn't know the identity of the man who came to see him, but understood him to be \"from the council\" in some way, and therefore an authority on the demolition issue. He says he took the man's advice to immediately respond to the council's formal consultation of residents by expressing support for the proposed demolition and sending off his form the following day. </p> <p>Last month, the Metropolitan Police were supplied with a document containing what was described as evidence supporting allegations that \"public officers\" had promised preferential treatment in the allocation of new homes in Seagrave Road to some residents of the estates in exchange for their supporting the proposed demolition. </p> <p>I understand that Scotland Yard detectives are still assessing the material, which sets out an argument that the law may have been broken. Whatever the police's conclusion, it is apparent that Tommy Pickett is not the only resident of the West Kensington estate with the clear impression of being told by someone working on the Earls Court project that they can be confident of securing one of those first 200 replacement homes.</p> <p>Elsie Webb, 65, who was born in Newcastle but has lived in Desborough House on the West Kensington estate in a two-bedroom flat with her son since 1983, and had previously lived for eight years in a different part of the estate, recalls attending a meeting about the future of the two estates at the Gibbs Green community centre, which she says took place \"about two years ago.\" She named two officers of Hammersmith and Fulham council who were at the meeting and answering questions from residents. Elsie recounts asking one of the officers a question in relation to the homes planned for Seagrave Road:</p> <blockquote> <p>I put my hand up and I said, \"I've got a difficulty here, I've got my son living with me and he's far too old to be living with me, he's 36 now.\" I said, \"Is there a possibility that you could give us two one-bedroom flats?\" \"Definitely,\" he says. I thought, oh, fantastic. That made me feel a bit better.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsie doesn't want to lose the flat she lives in at present and confirmed that she'd asked her question knowing that it might be demolished anyway. But if she were forced to move, she explained, it would be a consolation if her son, a working man whose earnings she indicated are too low to meet rents in the local private rented sector, got a council flat to himself at long last. She describes him as \"absolutely desperate\" to have his own place.</p> <p>I asked Elsie if she was quite sure that the council officer who answered her question was referring specifically to Seagrave Road, rather than the wider Earls Court project redevelopment area. She said she was certain that this was the case: </p> <blockquote> <p>[The officer] was talking about moving us to Seagrave Road. Cos I thought, here's my son's chance\u2026this would be a chance to get him housed.</p> </blockquote> <p>I twice invited Elsie to sum up the position as she saw it. After all, the officer might have simply handled her question badly. Perhaps a misunderstanding had occurred. Elsie herself described what the officer said as \"a burble promise,\" and says she isn't certain that it will be kept. So was she quite clear in her mind that she'd been told by an officer of H&amp;F that she would definitely \u2013 not just possibly - be allocated at least one of the new homes in the Seagrave Road development? \"Yes,\" she replied and then, \"Absolutely.\"</p> <p>Unlike Tommy Pickett, Elsie does not say that she was told she would receive priority treatment in the allocation of Seagrave Road homes if she quickly expressed support for the demolition of the West Kensington and Gibbs Green estates. She does, though, say that she firmly believes she has been told that two of the first 200 replacements for the 760 homes that will be demolished should the full Earls Court project go ahead will be given to her and her son. </p> <p>What if things don't work out that way? What if the council officer made an irresponsible commitment that won't be honoured? \"If this is fictitious, I'm definitely just going to stay here,\" Elsie said. \"I think I'll campaign, try and put letters through everybody's door, saying, 'You don't know where you're going now. If the council comes [to move you], say no!' Have a sit-in. Say, 'I'm not going anywhere.' Because, why should we be moved?</p> <p>There's nothing wrong with this building, it's perfectly sound structurally, and it's kept reasonably clean, you know, the lifts and the corridors, you don't see any mess there. I don't see anything wrong. Now, they're saying this is slummy. Can you see anything slummy? I can't. And this estate has been quite safe, I have never had a day's trouble. I used to go out dancing in my forties and fifties, and I'd walk up the road, two, three o'clock in the morning, absolutely not worried one bit.\"</p> <p>Hammersmith and Fulham has previously stated that it has not compiled an \"early leavers list\" or \"VIP list\" of estate residents to be given preferential treatment, and says will all be treated equally under a local lettings plan. However, the council's chief executive has said in correspondence with the leader of its opposition Labour group, <a href=\"http://www.thecowanreport.com/2012/09/has-h-council-been-complicit-in.html\">Stephen Cowan</a>, that he is \"satisfied\" that although council officers have not been involved, others with an interest in the estates being demolished did compile a list of residents favouring this course. </p> <p>I've invited the council to comment on the allegations contained in the report handed to the police and on what Elsie Webb has said in this article. I will add as an update any response that they provide.</p> <p><em>Comments are not open on this article but readers wishing to respond to it can email me at dave.hill@guardian.co.uk</em></p>",
  "<p>In his review, Labour MP Jon Cruddas criticises the book Britannia Unchained as \"extreme\", \"destructive\" and \"unpatriotic\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/27/britannia-unchained-global-lessons-review\" title=\"\">A route map to chaos</a>, 29 September). The book, which I co-authored with fellow Conservative MPs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/elizabeth-truss\" title=\"\">Liz Truss</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priti_Patel\" title=\"\">Priti Patel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2012/sep/17/kwasi-kwarteng-work-opt-out-culture-video\" title=\"\">Kwasi Kwarteng</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-skidmore\" title=\"\">Chris Skidmore</a>, takes a big-picture look at Britain in the 21st century.</p> <p>To thrive amid increasingly intense global competition, we argue, Britain needs to pay off its debts, plug the skills gap, create a fertile climate for innovation, and ensure that hard work pays. Cruddas acknowledges that Britain faces \"a fundamental choice \u2013 whether to manage decline or confront today's global challenges\". He breezily accepts that \"many of the remedies put forward here are pretty self-evident\" \u2013 a grudging compliment, and tacit admission of Labour failures after 13 years in power.</p> <p>But in the same breath he claims the book reveals a \"destructive economic liberalism\" where \"the state is assumed always to be malign\". This is impossible to reconcile with our focus on the pivotal role of state education in delivering economic competitiveness and social mobility \u2013 which has declined since the war \u2013 not to mention, for example, the lessons drawn from the role of the state in promoting venture capital for hi-tech startups in Israel.</p> <p>Cruddas claims we believe that \"banking crises are simply part of the natural order of things\", yet we painstakingly chart the smarter regulation of Canadian banks (higher capital ratios, stronger competition law, boring culture).</p> <p>He accuses us of depicting a \"binary world\" where \"the choice is between regulation and dynamism\", with a \"sink or swim\" mentality. True, we complain about the decline in UK economic competitiveness \u2013 from 4th to 13th on the <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-competitiveness\" title=\"\">World Economic Forum rankings</a> under Labour \u2013 but not least because it left Britain with 18% youth unemployment.</p> <p>Far from trumping the \"notion of community, society or indeed country\", our economic liberalism cries out for aspiration and a meritocratic vision of social fairness. Rewarding hard work \u2013 tackling welfare dependency, overhauling marginal tax rates, cutting red tape for startups \u2013 would boost enterprise and bolster social mobility. You can't help your background or innate talents, but anyone can graft. Why bother, if it doesn't pay?</p> <p>Likewise, we highlight <a href=\"http://www.niesr.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">research</a> by the National Institute of Economic and&#xa0;Social Research equating the national debt inherited by the coalition with a tax bill of \u00a3200,000 for each child&#xa0;growing up today. Labour's debt legacy threatens intergenerational injustice on&#xa0;a scale that dwarfs current grievances&#xa0;over cuts.</p> <p>Finally, we are accused of \"a brutal and destructive creed at odds with national interest\", not least because we don't pursue \"Britain's place within Europe\". In reality, we call for an outward-looking, global perspective that recognises the exponential rise of countries from Asia to Latin America.</p> <p>The fatal flaw in Cruddas's analysis is not merely that he tries to shoehorn us into his own prejudices \u2013 in direct contradiction of what we write \u2013 but that he fails to recognise the world as it is. Global competition means Britain must up its game, otherwise decline beckons and falling living standards risk becoming permanent. Ed Miliband handed Cruddas his \"blank piece of paper\" to come up with some concrete Labour policies. Furious critique is no substitute for credible answers.</p>",

It's not about us being excessive.\u201d</p> <p>Church, who gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry, said she felt Cameron was \u201cunder pressure\u201d from editors or the general press \u201cto keep this same old regulatory system which isn't working\u201d.</p> <p>But she said it was important for change to be introduced to ensure the victims who gave evidence to the year long inquiry had not done so in vain.</p> <p>Evan Harris, the former Liberal Democrat MP and associate director of the Hacked Off campaign, said the \u201ctake home\u201d message from the meeting was that lord Leveson should feel \u201cperfectly free to write whatever recommendations he feels he needs to write on hearing a year of evidence without fearing that because of something he wants to put in, that will be rejected. There was no sign from that meeting that that was likely to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Brian Cathcart, who founded the Hacked Off campaign, said the meeting had been productive.

As a Labour councillor, I was something of an intruder. I went a little red at the hotel reception, mumbling apologetically that I wasn\u2019t \u201cactually a Tory\u201d and feeling shell shocked at the huge numbers of powerful looking men in corporate suits. But as it turned out, one group of Conservatives were far more frightening than any other. These are the \"nice guys\", and they pose a serious electoral threat to Labour.</p> <p>This group is not a formal alliance, but they are all critical of economic liberalism. They are prepared to challenge the market when it isn\u2019t working for people, and they have a genuine concern for the poor. They are socially conservative, and believe in family, community and tradition. They admit that 1979 brought problems as well as benefits. They are sceptical of big business wielding too much power and stick up for strivers, whether they work in the public or private sector. They believe there is such a thing as society. They are, in essence, One Nation Tories.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/graemearcher/100184381/what-do-tory-activists-want-how-about-an-end-to-the-smug-upper-class-stereotype-andrew-mitchell-embodies/\">&#xa0;\u2022 Graeme Archer at the Telegraph says the Andrew Mitchell affair illustrates what could be the biggest problem facing the Tories.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Defeating Labour isn't the same thing as securing a Tory majority, however, as we learned in May 2010.

Unremarkable, you might say. Parties attack each other, particularly when conference season is on. However, there is a new intensity to the Tory leadership's assault on Ed Miliband. They don't seem to have been shaken by Labour's successful conference, but they have been stirred. They appear to appreciate that the threat level has changed.</p> <p>The old approach \u2013 of treating Miliband as a complete joke and smirking whilst explaining that he is the Tories secret electoral weapon \u2013 has been rendered redundant. Mili E has hardly been reborn as Tony Blair, but he has momentum and the huge advantage of a great many voters returning to Labour from the Lib Dems.</p> <p>This makes the next election more difficult for the Tories.

The Financial Times called it \"shock therapy for the country\", a quote the publishers apparently took as a compliment.</p> <p>I usually try to adopt a neutral tone in these blogposts, but I have to say I found the whole thing pretty terrifying. Britannia Unhinged might have been a better title.</p> <p>Raab lamented the fact that their book had been caricatured as \"Tories blast lazy Brits\", but said that since Thomas Edison's time \"the average number of hours worked by Britons has fallen by a third \u2026 We have a shrinking proportion peddling harder and harder not just to drive our economy but also to maintain our precious public services.\"</p> <p>He was keen for this not to be seen as public sector v private sector - he said that since 1997 lawyers' hours had stayed constant while police officers' had increased, for example - but he rather let the cat out of the bag by adding: \"On average public sector workers work two hours a week less than private sector employees yet they're paid more and they're less productive.\"</p> <p>Raab said that \"Labour's push to get 50% of young people into university was particularly pernicious. Too many of our universities are instilling a culture of laziness\" just when we needed the opposite. University students worked on average 26 hours a week, he said - \"seven hours less than the European average\". (The idea that university work can be totted up and compared this way seems a bit reductive to me.)</p> <p>He concluded: \"We're going to have to rediscover, recognise and reward the lost value of hard graft that made this country great\" - which really is not a million miles away from \"Tories blast lazy Brits\".</p> <p>Kwarteng also touched on education, saying that for 30 years exam results had improved, a sequence that could only be seen in the \"natural world\" in terms of life expectancy. Everyone else seems to be using the Olympics as an example of everything at the moment, so I will just politely ask him to consider that physical and sporting achievements are almost uniformly on the same sort of upward curves.</p> <p>Asked about the cancelled Building Schools for the Future programme, Skidmore said private companies made \"rapacious\" profits from it. \"Why do we not then have for-profit schools? \u2026 India, China, they're not spending the big bucks on the buildings. It's the teachers that matter.\"</p> <p>If anything, the audience seemed even more rightwing than the panel. The MPs were asked by businesswoman Rachel McLean: \"When I go to India I don't hear anybody talking about work-life balance \u2026 Why do we spend all our time talking about it in the UK?\"</p> <p>Raab replied that his wife was expecting their first child, but she \"earns considerably more than me\" so \"how do you balance the dual roles of breadwinning and childcaring?\" That was a \"major issue\" for his family, he said, although he did not see it as one of work-life balance.</p> <p>Patel said of Indian businessman Ratan Tata \"there was a great deal of hysteria when he said he comes over here and at 5pm people are simply not there [at work]\". There were different cultures in the country regarding work, she said. Her own immigrant parents \"worked 24/7 running small shops\", and Patel said she shared that work ethic.</p> <p>It was left to one delegate to point out that in countries such as India and China that the authors were lionising great proportions of the population \"work very hard but for very little money\". Patel said they weren't holding up these countries as role models but merely pointing out that they were now Britain's competitors.</p> <p>A male delegate asked why there was such public hostility to the \"modest improvements\" (aka cuts) the government were making. Raab's impenetrable answer was: \"We don't stretch debate enough \u2026 What we must do is have more rigour and more scrutiny and open it up.\" Kwarteng said those protesting were merely speaking up for their own \"sectional interests\".</p> <p>Kwarteng, as you might expect, attacked Labour for having run up deficits in times of growth. But more surprisingly he praised the 1997-2001 Labour government - which didn't do that - as \"probably the best government on a fiscal basis since the war\".</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T15:23:17.102Z\">at 4.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50743737c0e361310bc6ca8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T14:39:51.714Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, is speaking now.

The general secretaries are ordering - ordering - their members not to cover classes where another teacher might be ill or away at a relative's funeral. They are arguing that teachers give only the most perfunctory reports. They are saying that teachers shouldn't do photocopying, they are saying that teachers shouldn't put up displays, they are saying that teachers shouldn't invigilate exams. They are saying that teachers shouldn't do what has drawn them into the classroom in the first place, which is to devote themselves to the children.</p> <p>I have a simple message to those union general secretaries: don't let your ideologies hold back our children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Predictably, the unions have hit back.</p> <p>This is from <strong>Chris Keates</strong>, general secretary of the NASUWT.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This attack on teachers taking lawful industrial action in defence of their statutory contractual rights and entitlements will be greeted with deep concern by the profession. The action short of strike action by members of the NASUWT and NUT is ensuring that teachers' time is focused on delivering the highest standards of teaching and learning for every pupil.</p> <p>Michael Gove appears to want to return schools to a past where teachers spent their days standing at photocopiers or undertaking bureaucratic form filling, rather than concentrating on teaching and learning.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is from <strong>Christine Blower</strong>, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Michael Gove does not have a monopoly of concern that all children and young people should have high aspiration and the very best teaching and support to achieve. In the NUT we believe this is best done in schools which are well supported by local authorities \u2026</p> <p>Our action taken alongside colleagues in the NASUWT is designed to protect teachers and defend education.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T14:07:14.322Z\">at 3.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50742d10c0e361310bc6ca88\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T13:56:32.607Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the World at One earlier, <strong>Michael Gove</strong> repeated an assertion he has made before about not being a suitable replacement for the prime minister. \"I could not be prime minister,\" he said. \"I'm not equipped to be prime minister.

I was told the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/05/green-growth-false-choice-cbi\">CBI's report on the green economy this summer was influential</a>, which it should be given the disastrous state of the UK economy overall.</p> <p>A renewed push by Cameron would be a welcome development, even if long overdue and only driven by his desperation for growth.

Shapps has not been involved with the website for some years, but the controversy has still undermined his standing as party chairman.

Before he arrives, it's worth quoting an extract from an article about the Johnson/Cameron rivalry in this week's New Statesman. It's by Andrew Gimson, Johnson's biographer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Boris Johnson is trying to kill David Cameron. That may sound like an exaggeration, but the word \u201ckill\u201d was used by Johnson himself, in a column about \u201cthe basic drama of politics\u201d written soon after the Labour landslide of 1997: \u201cPolitics is a constant repetition, in cycles of varying length, of one of the oldest myths in human culture, of how we make kings for our societies, and how after a while we kill them to achieve a kind of rebirth \u2013 as Tony Blair would put it, new life for Britain\" \u2026</p> <p>Johnson is now in a position to persecute the prime minister almost daily. On past form, he will use the Tory conference in Birmingham once more to upstage Cameron. The Mayor of London can be bolder about tax cuts, the des\u00adirability of getting rid of the euro, the need for a new airport, the best ways of getting Labour voters to back the Tories, and also on any passing issue of the hour, such as the atrocious manners of Andrew Mitchell, the chief whip who called the police plebs. Cameron, as the cautious voice of the establishment, cannot match Johnson the Merry England maverick on any of these subjects.</p> <p>Over the next three years, we can expect Johnson to bend every sinew to demonstrate that he is the party\u2019s greatest electoral asset and the one man who could lead it to an overall majority. He will try to become the person to whom the party feels compelled to turn. It is notable that he is already spoken of as a man for the top job or for no job at all. If he does one day supplant Cameron, he will regard it as belated recognition of his natural supremacy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T10:04:19.139Z\">at 11.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073f3b558f91d7bbadac138\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:51:49.503Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris bingo</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We're going to be playing Boris bingo during Johnson's speech, which starts in about 10 minutes. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2012/oct/09/boris-johnson-speech-bingo-conservative-conference-2012\">Click here for your bingo card</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T10:04:38.657Z\">at 11.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073f22458f91d7bbadac137\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:45:08.723Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some of the best Conservative conference stories and articles from today's papers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2214820/Pick-punishment-May-tells-victims-crime-unveils-sweeping-justice-reforms.html\">\u2022 Theresa May tells the Daily Mail in an interview that victims of antisocial behaviour will be given a say in how offenders are punished.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2018One of the big problems for the victims of antisocial behaviour is that they feel powerless,\u2019 said Mrs May.</p> <p>\u2018Somebody does something to them or their property and they feel they don\u2019t get reparation, or feel they are not part of the process.</p> <p>\u2018We want to ensure that they have a choice.

You have to put yourself in the position of the man or woman who has reacted to the presence of a burglar and has reacted with fury, with anxiety, with fear, and with all the various different emotions which will be generated, and who has no time for calm reflection.

Here are the main points. I've taken some of the quotes from the Press Association.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron said that having a referendum would be \"the cleanest, neatest, simplest and most sensible\" way of obtaining public consent for a new settlement with the EU</strong>. Previously he said that a referendum or a general election could be used to obtain public support for a new EU deal, but this morning's comment makes it almost inevitable that the party will back a referendum (see 8.39am).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government was changing the law about tackling burglars because currently there was \"uncertainty\" about the level of force that was allowed.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there has been uncertainty about what proportionate means are so we are saying you can do anything as long as it is not grossly disproportionate. You couldn't, for instance, stab a burglar if they were unconscious. But really we should be putting the law firmly on the side of the homeowner, the householder, the family and saying, when that burglar crosses that threshold, invades your home, threatens your family, they give up their rights \u2026</p> <p>I'm more interested in the rights of the people who want to defend their homes and their properties.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that he was not concerned that Boris Johnson was more popular with the Conservative party than he was.</strong> On ITV's Daybreak the presenter said that, while the Tories were chanting \"Boris, Boris, Boris\", they weren't chanting \"Dave, Dave, Dave\". Cameron said this because he was prime minister.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are lots of people that are more popular than me in this world, because I have to be the one who takes the difficult decisions on behalf of the country to recover us from the dreadful state that Labour left us in. That's just life, but in politics what matters is you do your duty, you do the right thing for your country.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that he wanted to have \"big stars in the Conservative party that can carry our message to the country\". He said he had told Johnson that, when he stands down as mayor, he should look for another job in politics. Cameron may, however, have given a better indication of his true feelings when James Naughtie asked if he had thought of offering Johnson a job abroad. Cameron clearly found the prospect attractive (see 8.30am and 8.53am).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He rejected claims that the welfare cuts announced this week meant that the Conservatives were once more the \"nasty\" party.</strong> When this was put to him on ITV's Daybreak, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't accept that for a moment. When we came to power there were people all over the country getting up and going to work and their taxes were going towards families in London who were getting each \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000 of housing benefit every year. That isn't fair, so I want a fair welfare system that works for everybody.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also rejected claims that the Conservative party was turning to the right. Citing his decision to announce more money for the NHS and to protect the aid budget, he said the party was not being leftwing or rightwing but just demonstrating \"sensible, common ground, common sense. Conservative, practical thinking\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He refused to say whether or not he believed Andrew Mitchell's denial that he called police officers at the gates of Downing Street \"plebs\". </strong>When James Naughtie said that Cameron had chosen to believe Mitchell rather than the officer who wrote up a report of the incident in his log, Cameron queried this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, what I chose to do was accept the fact that Andrew Mitchell has apologised and the police don't want to take their complaint further, or take any further action, and they accepted his apology. This is what I accept. I'm not going to go into the private conversations I had.

The government has taken several measures to get more money from the rich. You would not accept me making budget measures on this programme.</p> <p><em>Q: But you've done that with welfare measures.

May is expected to indicate at the very least that the UK will opt out of EU police and justice co-operation when the decision has to be made in 2014. This will be packaged up as part of the UK repatriating powers from Europe. But it will be hugely controversial as it involves areas of international police co-operation including the European arrest warrant, the instrument under which James Forrest was arrested recently in France after leaving the country with his pupil Megan Stammers. The arrest warrant is seen by police and intelligence officers as one of the most successful instruments in European crime fighting, having helped speed up extraditions and the whole process of bringing some of Europe's most wanted criminals to justice. If the UK opts out of all police and justice co-operation it can selectively opt back in to some of it at a later stage, provided other countries do so. But this is an important statement of this government's new direction on Europe. Nick Clegg has gone out of his way to praise the arrest warrant and the broader policy of cross-border crime fighting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T08:37:55.822Z\">at 9.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073ca6058f91d7bbadac11b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T06:56:49.424Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's David Cameron's 46th birthday today and he's celebrating it by giving a round of interviews.

  "<p>Nosa Aimuyo represents a dilemma for the US supreme court. The young African American student cannot say precisely how he won a place at the University of Texas in Austin. His grades were good although not near enough to the top of his class to guarantee him entry. But he had a couple of extra strings to his bow as a musician and in speaking a foreign language. Then there was the colour of his skin.</p> <p>\"I can't say what got me in. I was raised in an upper middle class neighbourhood in Dallas, and went to a middle class school so I wasn't disadvantaged,\" said Aimuyo. \"But my background is unusual. I was born in Oklahoma but my parents are from Nigeria. In school, I played in the band, I was a volunteer, I was in French class. There was more to me getting in than just my academics and just my race.\"</p> <p>The supreme court may see the things differently as it takes up the divisive issue of affirmative action in education on Wednesday. The nine judges will hear arguments on behalf of a white woman, Abigail Fisher, who says she was denied a place at the University of Texas because black and Latino students got precedence. Students such as Aimuyo.</p> <p>Fisher is backed by an array of interests that see the case as part of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/sep/06/civil-rights-voting-under-threat-discrimination\">broader challenge to civil rights-era laws and policies </a>intended to reverse the historic injustices endured by racial minorities, in particular African Americans. Those groups argue that even if affirmative action was at one time legitimate and necessary \u2013 and not all accept that \u2013 the need for racial preferences is past and they are now unfairly disadvantaging white people.</p> <p>Critics want the court to rule that it is illegal to consider race in any shape or form in university admissions, a move that could turn efforts to broaden higher education in the US on their head.</p> <p>The University of Texas says it is a mistake to portray the issue as black and white. It argues that race plays a \"modest and nuanced\" part in its admissions procedure as the university seeks to create a diverse student body that also takes account of other factors such as class, where the student grew up, school performance relative to classmates, and political and religious affiliations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397680292\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/9/1349798412075/university-of-texas-austi-006.jpg\" alt=\"university of texas austin\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despite its diversity, the University of Texas is not without its racial problems. Photograph: Eric Gay/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greg Vincent, the University of Texas vice-president for diversity, said it is difficult to separate race out from the circumstances and experiences that shape potential students \u2013 and that without taking those on board, white students from privileged backgrounds and private schools would have a significant advantage.</p> <p>\"You look at all of the factors that make up a person. It's not this neat formula. Race is a very important factor in today's society \u2013&#xa0;there's no getting around that. But there are many other dimensions about an individual. All of those things become a factor. If race doesn't fit into a category it's because it's not supposed to,\" he said.</p> <p>The university has the backing of Obama administration. In a brief to the court, it said that diversity in education is a national security issue with the military, FBI, CIA and department of homeland security relying on a regular supply of well educated recruits from an array of backgrounds.</p> <p>Colin Powell, the former US secretary of state and ex-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, joined other retired senior military officers in urging the supreme court to rule in favour of the University of Texas. So have large corporations, including Microsoft and Walmart, which told the supreme court that they \"must be able to hire highly trained employees of all races, religions, cultures and economic backgrounds\".</p> <h2>'Race is still a huge determining factor in your quality of life'</h2> <p>Texas has an unusual but not unique law that allocates 75% of places at the university to the best performing students in each state-run school. That has made its own significant contribution to diversity by, ironically, relying on the reality that many Texas schools are effectively segregated by geography, class and race.</p> <p>This year, the top 9% of pupils from every state school \u2013 from inner city Latino neighbourhoods, wealthy Houston suburbs, poor white rural small towns and districts with mostly African American residents \u2013 secured automatic places at the University of Texas.</p> <p>The legal fight is over how the remaining 25% of students are admitted \u2013 or rejected, in Fisher's case.</p> <p>Her lawyers argue that the automatic entry for top performing students is its own form of affirmative action in providing a path for underprivileged Latino and black students, and no more is needed. Vincent said it has contributed to diversity but it is not enough.</p> <p>\"Things have improved in some significant ways. There's no doubt the world is better today than it was 50 years ago. That being said, race is still a huge determining factor in your quality of life,\" he said. \"You have at least a third of African Americans who are solidly in the underclass, who are mired in poverty and have very little opportunity to get out.\"</p> <p>The Center for Equal Opportunity is among more than 20 groups and individuals filing briefs with the supreme court <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs/11-345_petitioneramcuplfetal.authcheckdam.pdf\">in support of Fisher</a>. Its president, Roger Clegg, who served in senior legal positions in the Reagan and Bush senior administrations, calls the university's policy \"racial gerrymandering\".</p> <p>\"The costs of engaging in racial discrimination in college admissions are huge and they overwhelm any conceivable benefit. The benefits are negligible if not non-existent,\" said Clegg. \"You begin with the fact that by making an exception to the principle of non-discrimination you're setting a very dangerous precedent and also it's personally unfair to tell somebody that you would have gotten in if you'd had a different skin colour. You create resentment. You stigmatise so-called beneficiaries.\"</p> <p>Almuyo is not among the beneficiaries who feels stigmatised.</p> <p>\"Affirmative action is supposed to remedy a lot of historical inequalities that have been the result of the civil rights tensions our country has gone through. There's so much less opportunity in underprivileged areas of this state,\" he said. \"And so this Fisher case is so important because it could have a drastic effect on how the university admits people if the supreme court is against it.\"</p> <h2>Students appreciative of diversity</h2> <p>The University of Texas has been at the heart of a groundbreaking supreme court decision on race before.</p> <p>In 1950, the court struck down the \"separate but equal\" doctrine when an African American man, Heman Sweatt, sued after he was barred from the university's law school in Austin because the Texas state constitution imposed segregation in education. When Sweatt took the issue to court, the university established a separate law school for black students in Houston. The supreme court ruled that the black law school might be separate but it was not equal both in the quality of its facilities and teaching staff.</p> <p>More than 60 years later, a series of supreme court rulings have barred the use of racial quotas or a points system based on ethnicity as part of university admissions. But the court did permit the consideration of race as an influence in pursuit of a diverse student body provided it is not the deciding factor.</p> <p>\"One of the reasons why diversity is so important is that having a diverse class both promotes cross-cultural, cross-racial understanding and decreases the harmful effects of stereotypes,\" said Vincent.</p> <p>That does not mean the University of Texas is without its racial problems. Last week, a few hundred students led a protest march through the campus against incidents of racism including the throwing of balloons filled with bleach at black students. Four such attacks took place last month alone.</p> <p>Students at the University of Texas generally said they appreciated the value of diversity because it brought different experiences and ideas into the classroom. But that did not necessarily translate into support for racial preferences.</p> <p>\"I think on a college application you shouldn't even be able to print what your ethnicity is,\" Kaitlin Valentine, a biology major. \"They just shouldn't even look at that. Then the top people would get in. That would be the criteria.\"</p> <p>Adison Martinez, an information science student who describes his family as Anglo even though he has a Hispanic name, is also sceptical. </p> <p>\"I don't think racial discrimination is as pressing as it used to be. I know Hispanics do fall under the umbrella of being a minority but in Texas I don't feel like there's discrimination against Hispanics,\" he said. \"My relatives are in north Texas, and they say they're white people and a minority now. Obviously there's so many minorities they're displacing white people in Texas.\"</p> <p>But Sam Hermitte, a graduate student at studying public affairs, scorns that view. </p> <p>\"Until there's equal treatment all the way up the pipeline, I don't think you can be at the end of the pipeline and say now everything's completely level when others haven't had the same opportunities for education because they grew up in poor areas. There are lots of things that are still very inequitable in the system and so I think it is still necessary in the university,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>There's someone downstairs. An intruder. You have a choice: cower or confront? Under the latest plan of the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, you will not only be able to fight a burglar, but also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/09/chris-grayling-self-defence-lawyers?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">use \"disproportionate force\"</a>, without legal reprisals.</p> <p>You might welcome these new rights for homeowners, because, if you or your family were in danger, you would do everything \u2013 anything \u2013 to protect them, wouldn't you? I thought that. And then it happened.</p> <p>I awoke in the early hours of July 31, 1997, to the sound of people running through my flat. There was nowhere to hide, no time to make a choice about what to do, so I simply got out of bed, just as three men burst through my bedroom door. They picked up whatever makeshift weapons they could see \u2013 bricks and saucepans \u2013 and beat my flatmate and I in our adjacent rooms. They hit me so hard my teeth were forced through my cheek. I put up no fight. This saved my life. Instead, I simply knelt in my blood pleading. On their way out, after robbing us, one of them said: \"There'll be no comeback.\"</p> <p>It took years to recover psychologically, but it could have been so much worse. And if Grayling's plans are implemented, which looks likely \u2013 where is the opposition? \u2013 future victims will suffer even more than I did.</p> <p>There is an excellent reason why the police encourage the public to acquiesce to the demands of thieves: you stand a better chance of survival. If I had known before the attack I could fight back disproportionately, I might have kept a knife by the bed. In that instant I could have stabbed one of them. The other two intruders would have retaliated. Would I be here now?</p> <p>Grayling talked about giving immunity to \"householders who act instinctively\", as if instincts were entirely natural, rather than conditioned. If you teach a child to react with violence, violence becomes their instinct. In the same way, if you give the public licence to react disproportionately, how many more baseball bats will be kept under beds? How many people will attack back only to be murdered?</p> <p>And how, in turn, will burglars arm themselves in future? Mine arrived without any weapons. Following Grayling's announcement, you should be even more terrified if you hear someone downstairs: they will not be empty-handed.</p> <p>And what if you kill them? I know this much: better to be a victim than a perpetrator. My conscience is clear. I cannot forgive the men who attacked me, but I'm aware that they had led considerably worse lives than I had. They didn't deserve to die.</p> <p>If this bill is passed, terrible mistakes will almost certainly be made. Last month <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/police-masked-teen-killed-dad-knife/story?id=17349516#.UHRI5s2XPdw\" title=\"\">15-year-old Tyler Guiliano</a> from Connecticut put on a ski mask and was shot dead by his father who believed he was an intruder.</p> <p>Last year, if my instincts had been shaped differently, I too could have become an accidental murderer. I went to put the rubbish out, leaving my front door open for a few seconds, and when I turned back I saw someone running into my house. Terrified, I went to the door and saw the culprit \u2013 a teenage girl \u2013 just as a voice shouted from behind: \"I'm so sorry, my daughter's autistic, she just ran in there.\"</p> <p>Grayling believes his law will \"dispel doubts in this area once and for all\". It won't. It allows the use of disproportionate force yet, he says, \"this is not about letting people go on the rampage\". So where is the line? The police, the CPS and in some cases a jury, just as they currently do, will have to establish if the reaction constituted \"reasonable force\". And you and I will be left with the same question: cower or confront?</p>",

She stands immovable, her eyes flashing this way and that. In Athens, as she stood behind a lectern after talks with the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, the German chancellor was so restrained she hardly moved at all.</p> <p>The Greek capital resembled Fort Knox \u2013 with riot police guarding her every move, helicopters roaring overhead and marksmen installed on the rooftops of buildings great and small \u2013 but Europe's most powerful woman was having none of it. The angry chants and hoarse slogans of the thousands of protesters who had also come out to greet her, eliciting one of the biggest security operations ever put on by near-bankrupt Greece, belonged to another world. As did the copious amounts of acrid teargas that wafted through the Athens air.</p> <p>In the marble interior of the mansion that is the prime minister's office, Merkel had a message and on this, her first visit to Greece since the eruption of Europe's debt drama, it was a message she was determined to convey.</p> <p>\"I have not come as a taskmaster,\" she said, her eyes elevated towards the room's ornate sunlit ceiling as if focusing on some indefinable spot. \"And nor have I come as a teacher to give grades,\" she added, now focusing intently on the marble floor. \"I have come as a friend to listen and be informed.\"</p> <p>Three years into the crisis that began in Athens, Merkel also wanted to say she understood \"a lot\" was being demanded of Greece. She was not the austerity warmonger that critics had painted her to be. \"I come in full and firm awareness of what the people of Greece are going through,\" she said. But, she continued, Europe's weakest link was badly in need of change \u2013 and if reforms were not made now, they would come back \"in a much more dramatic way\".</p> <p>\"I come from East Germany and I know how long it takes to build reform,\" she said, almost by way of reassurance. \"The road for the people of Greece is very tough, very difficult, but they have put a good bit of the path behind them. I want to say you are making progress!\"</p> <p>But even as the leader attempted not to sound like the matriarch in charge of the family till, there is no denying that that is exactly what she is.</p> <p>\"Saying that she is not here to preach is bullshit,\" said one of the small retinue of Berlin-based journalists who follow her every move. \"She is here to tell them exactly what to do.\"</p> <p>For the vast majority of Greeks, no person is more identified than Merkel with the punitive measures that have ensnared the country in unprecedented recession and record levels of poverty and unemployment.</p> <p>As up to 300,000 took to the streets in an enormous display of fury over the savage cuts and tax increases that have brought growing numbers to the brink of penury, it was the woman who is widely seen as the \"architect of austerity\" that was in their sights.</p> <p>\"If I met her, I would say if you had read Greek history you would have been more aware,\" said Takis Stavropoulos, a bearded leftist who had converged with thousands of other protesters on Syntagma square. \"If she had done that she would have known we would resist.\"</p> <p>No government has been in as difficult a place as the ruling coalition that Samaras has led since June. Although Merkel's surprise visit was seen as a major coup, with officials hailing it as further proof of Berlin's new-found willingness to keep Greece in the 17-member eurozone, there was also an acceptance that the chancellor's six-hour presence in Athens, while rich in symbolism, did not yield much in the way of substance.</p> <p>Merkel's Calvinist approach to dealing with Europe's crisis-hit southern periphery may have softened, as the leader looks to re-election next year, but as tiny Greece stares into the abyss with enough funds to survive only until the end of next month, the message was clear: apply more draconian measures and the rescue funds will keep pouring in. Echoing the complaint of German commentators, Greek analysts agreed that the visit was long overdue.</p> <p>\"It is hard not to see this visit had a more important message for Germany ahead of [next September's] general elections than it did for Greece,\" opined the prominent commentator Yiannis Pretenderis.</p> <p>The sad reality remains. After the biggest debt write-down in the history of world finance and two EU-IMF-sponsored bailouts worth a mammoth \u20ac240bn (\u00a3190bn), Greece is still far from being saved and, worse, is slipping inexorably into social meltdown with its political arena ever more radicalised. The draconian \u20ac13.5bn package of spending cuts that is the price of further aid could, many fear, push Greece further to the edge.</p> <p>Back at the heart of the government, untouched by the discord of everyday life, the awkwardness of Greece's relationship with its big brother was on display in the body language of its prime minister. As Merkel, the pastor's daughter, spoke, Samaras, whose background is privileged elite, Harvard and moneyed, looked on and winced.</p> <p>\"Greeks are a proud people,\" he said. \"And our enemy is recession. But we are not asking for favours. In my discussion with the German chancellor I pointed out, however, that the Greek people are bleeding.\" As he spoke, Merkel remained static before pursing her lips and looking away.</p>",
  "<p>In her history of the feminist movement, In Our Time, Susan Brownmiller writes about the moment when the term \"sexual harassment\" first began being used publicly. It was the mid-1970s, and a group of women activists at Cornell University in the US were organising a \"speak-out\", and wanted to define their subject matter appropriately. They considered \"sexual intimidation\", \"sexual coercion\" and \"sexual exploitation on the job\", before finally arriving at sexual harassment. That was&#xa0;it. That was the term that described what women had been experiencing in&#xa0;offices and factories the world over, a description that could&#xa0;encompass everything: the suggestive, slyly intimidating remarks from bosses, the&#xa0;badgering for sexual favours, the constant comments on a&#xa0;woman's appearance, the groping, knee-touching, bottom-slapping shame&#xa0;of it all.</p> <p>The problem was ripe to be named. In the past week, as part of the fall-out from Jimmy Savile's alleged predations, there have been constant reminders of&#xa0;that era, of the casual sexism, often tipping into outright misogyny, that affected so many women in the workplace. DJ Liz Kershaw, for instance, has said she was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/06/dj-liz-kershaw-routinely-groped-bbc\" title=\"\">routinely groped</a> by another presenter when working at Radio 1 in the 1980s; while broadcasting, she would suddenly feel \"wandering hands up my jumper fondling my breasts\".</p> <p>The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig has also said she was groped <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/07/sandi-toksvig-i-was-groped-on-air\" title=\"\">\"on air, by a famous individual\"</a> in that decade, in her early 20s, and \"everybody thought it was amusing. There was a sort of shrugged-shoulder approach to the whole thing\". In response, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2214350/JANET-STREET-PORTER-More-men-TV-just-Jimmy-Savile-women-sex-playthings.html\" title=\"\">Janet Street-Porter wrote</a> that, in the media back then, she knew of one comedian who \"would wave his penis at horrified women in the makeup department\".</p> <p>These comments have, predictably, been dismissed by some. The former breakfast presenter Mike Smith has said, for instance, of Kershaw's claims about the atmosphere of Radio 1 back then that it was actually \"more camp than predatory\". And others, while accepting that sexual harassment was rife in the 70s and 80s, have suggested it has all changed for women in the workplace now. The implication is that a combination of awareness, women's growing economic power and legislation that began with the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act and has been updated repeatedly, has stamped out the problem.</p> <p>Laura Bates, who set up the website <a href=\"http://www.everydaysexism.com/\" title=\"\">Everyday Sexism</a> earlier this year, isn't so sure. Like those 1970s speak-outs, her site allows women to share their experiences, and over the course of six months 7,500 entries have poured in, \"thousands of which pertain specifically to workplace harassment, workplace sexism and sadly, in many cases, workplace sexual assault and even rape\". \"What I don't know is whether the prevalence has diminished or not [since the 70s],\" she says. \"But I do know that an Equal Opportunities Commission report in 2000 said that 50% of women still experience sexual harassment in the workplace.\"</p> <p>Strong, recent statistical evidence is&#xa0;lacking, but <a href=\"http://www.equalitylaw.co.uk/news/2378/66/Half-of-female-workforce-fear-sexual-harassment-at-work/\" title=\"\">a survey of 3,400 women</a> conducted for the website AdviseMeBarrister.com earlier this year found half had been harassed in the workplace, and, of those who had, four in 10 had been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable. A&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2011/11/15/gIQACBryPN_story.html\" title=\"\">2011 poll</a> for the Washington Post and ABC News found a quarter of women had been harassed at work. And the experiences that women report on Bates's website horribly echo those from the 70s.</p> <p>One woman writes that while working on a film shoot a couple of years ago, one of the directors \"slapped my arse to get my attention\"; a male colleague she discussed this with later said she \"should lighten up\" and take it as a joke. Another woman was asked by her boss, in front of 30 colleagues, \"if I wax my crack\"; another heard a global leader say to a female colleague who was doing some filing that \"he liked a woman on her knees\"; one was asked, at interview, about her sex life, and told she was expected to be \"tits and arse\"; still another wrote that, although she is over 40 and a professional who dresses conservatively, \"in the course of one business day I had one client comment on my looks and figure, and another business contact comment he 'liked my tits' and ask about my bikini line.\"</p> <p>But surely the boob-groping is over? That was the response of one of my colleagues when discussing this matter. Surely that, at least, was left behind in the 70s? Siobhan Endean, equalities officer at Unite, laughs at the thought, and says she has plenty of \"examples where women have been physically attacked in the workplace, definitely. I&#xa0;don't think that has changed.\" Bates agrees and quotes more examples that&#xa0;have been sent to her. \"'Every time I climbed up the ladder into the storeroom, my boss would slap me on&#xa0;the bottom. I needed the job, so I&#xa0;didn't say anything for a very long time.' Or, here's another one: 'Once raped by a colleague on a night out, guess who lost their job? (Not him).' There are hundreds of them.\"</p> <p>So why is there this idea that workplaces are so much better now? Part of it, perhaps, is that sexual harassment affects women at different times in their lives. Endean says it is a&#xa0;particular problem, for instance, for&#xa0;young female apprentices in male-dominated workplaces and, anecdotally, many of us are affected by the issue when we start work in our late teens and early 20s. It's an issue of power. As&#xa0;individual women get older and more personally powerful, sexual harassment often has less effect on them, and so they believe it has been left behind in another era.</p> <p>This is compounded by the fact that harassment seems as difficult to speak out about as ever. Endean says that by the time harassment claims reach her union, women are often \"off work sick with stress, or finding a way out of the organisation, or are having disciplinary procedures taken against them for non-performance\". Disciplinary procedures against women who bring complaints happen quite regularly, she says. \"That's what tends to happen: there's quite often an aggressive response. If women raise the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace they will be told: 'It's not because you're a woman, it's because you're not performing.' Or&#xa0;they'll end up in the malicious complaints process. I've had to deal with a case of that just this morning.\"</p> <p>Not only is classic workplace sexual harassment still going on, says Bates, but technology has created new forms; in the space of six months, she has seen several thousand abusive emails, including rape threats and death threats. As those 1975 feminists knew, what's important is to stop the silence around the issue. \"I think there's an idea that women have to put up and shut up,\" says Bates. \"They're told they're whining, being uptight, frigid, sometimes even blamed for causing it in the first place. And, of course, we're still living in a world where women haven't achieved gender parity in either pay or the workplace, or in female representation at the top of big business, parliament, the judiciary. So I think women are still in an unequal position, where to bring up issues of sexual harassment and to speak out against them risks worsening an already existing prejudice.\" One that is, apparently, as troubling as&#xa0;ever.</p> <p><em>Have you experienced sexual harassment at work \u2013 and do you think the situation has improved at all?</em></p>",
  "<p>Let's start with the vignettes. Wind back to the 1980s. A young reporter, with a big afro and minimal experience joins a local newspaper not known for its liberalism. The early days are difficult. His performance is discussed out of earshot. \"He's just so slow and lazy, isn't he?\" says an executive, all matter of fact. \"They're all like that,\" his colleague replies.</p> <p>Time moves on. Said reporter pitches up at the Daily Express on a night shift. The newsroom is vast and open-planned and \u2013 in keeping with the black fashion of the day \u2013 he has shaved his hair low at the sides, leaving the bulk of it up top. He enters. The cavernous newsroom falls silent \u2013 like a western saloon bar when the stranger comes to town. He scans the room, frames something between a smile and a scowl and barks \"evening\" to no one in particular. The normal hubbub resumes.</p> <p>Days turn into years and, along with Fleet Street's finest, he is sent to Suffolk where a black woman, troubled of mind, has killed her children. The press pack scour the area for friends or confidants. One is located and a veteran reporter shares the spoils with his colleagues. \"He's a big bloke,\" he says, garrulous, gabbling, mouth outpacing his brain. \"He's also a nigger,\" he adds by way of description. His voice tails off as his brain sees the danger \u2013 but it's too late. The words are audible. For a second, there is silence.</p> <p>The past was indeed another country. To survive as a visible minority in the workplaces of the 70s and 80s required the ability to manoeuvre strange and occasionally hostile territory. It doesn't feel like that now, but that's not to say it might not feel like that for others. Generally, the focus shifts to the next group that hasn't yet assimilated into the dominant culture of the office. I can say things are fine, for I speak the language, watch football, drink alcohol and pay scant attention to religion. Is everything different?</p> <p>Try asking a Pole with an accent or a religiously observant Pakistani.</p> <p>For Linda Bellos, chair of the Institute of Equality and Diversity Practitioners, race relations in the workplace reflect changes in society and those changes have largely been shaped by legislation. The Race Relations Act of 1976 and the Sex Discrimination Act were little observed in the early years but came to be utilised by local authorities. \"They were ridiculed at the time as 'loony left', but councils such as Lambeth and Haringey began insisting that managers actually obeyed the law concerning discrimination,\" says Bellos. The law doesn't change hearts but it can regulate behaviour. \"We have got fewer ethnic minorities being denied jobs in general. But, of course, we know there isn't the kind of representation there should be in management or in the boardroom. If you are black and middle-class, you are reasonably OK. If you are black and working-class, that's different. Class plays a big role in determining whether you fit in and, consequently, how you are treated.\"</p> <p>But change will never be uniform. Workplaces reflect society, and some are more closed than others, be they a City trading floor, or the House of Commons, or a newsroom or Radio 1 in the 80s. They maintain a culture within the perimeter. The world outside changes: they barely notice. It's in those places that progress is most patchy.</p> <p>Change has been slow, but it does emerge. Neanderthal bosses retire. Their replacements absorb the culture, but they are younger and have different experiences; minority friends, minority neighbours; less fear of \"the other\". They start from a different place. And as different people work together, their differences seem less important. \"They're all like that,\" the senior journalist said. Five years later, he helped me get to Fleet Street.</p>",
  "<p>There comes a point in every gal's life when she has to ask herself: what would Karl Marx think of my bank card? Would he admire its bright colours? Its snazzy fonts? Or would he view it as the very epitome of commodity fetishism?</p> <p>This point will probably come when you see a particular TV advert, one that will, in all likelihood, make you mutter: \"My God, end of days!\"</p> <p>End of Days adverts are a very special breed of advert. They are not merely bad (most adverts are bad because they treat the public like idiots); they convey something very worrying about the times in which we live. Other End of Days adverts include, in no particular order: Tiffany from EastEnders talking about her digestion in a chair hanging on a chain; a dancing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNFgCo1Hfc\" title=\"\">Gavin Henson promoting online bingo</a>; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCAmZ9cOaoc\" title=\"\">Peter Schmeichel playing an accordion for the benefit of bacon sales</a>; and any \"Trojan personal massage\" adverts you might see in the US, if you get lucky. Or not, as the case may be when it comes to \"personal massages\". These adverts present the greatest argument there is that Darwinism is a myth.</p> <p>But this particular advert is, I believe, the endingest day of all. Never mind Kevin \u2013 we need&#xa0;to talk about this advert.</p> <p>It's an advert for a particular service offered by a particular bank that allows you to \"personalise your bank card\". What this means, in non-bank speak, is you can put a photo of your children, your friends or your pet on your bank card. Because nothing says \"loving parent\" more than sticking your kids' faces on a bit of plastic and then mashing said plastic into a machine that is helping you spend your children's future inheritance that little bit faster. I am failing to think of a purer example of social relations being translated into economic relations between people, just as Marx foresaw.</p> <p>So I took to the phones to find out more about this heinous scheme from the bank's press office and for the very first time in my 15 years of dealing with this bank \u2013 which happens also to be my bank \u2013 I got through straight away to an actual human being. Some could say this suggests the bank cares more about journalists than its customers, but let's not get distracted.</p> <p>This service, the spokesperson explained, is a way for \"customers to express their personality through their bank card\". Yes, that sentence was uttered by a human person on the planet on which you live.</p> <p>This service also allows the bank \"to express what it represents, which is bringing a personalised element to banking\", which is funny as I thought what this particular bank represents in most people's minds is bringing a Libor-rigging element to banking, as opposed to a comedy photo of someone's dog, but it's amazing what you can learn from a press office. \"It's a way of expressing the personal services offered here,\" she continued \u2013 although seeing as she then said she'd need more than 24 hours to tell me what photos most people put on their bank cards, that service is clearly still lacking in something, personal or otherwise.</p> <p>\"People are always looking to personalise things these days,\" she continued and here this bank has a point. There are many things in the modern world that encourage infantalisation of adults to varying degrees, from those babyish sippy cups in which you tote your takeaway coffee to Crocs to talking in text speak (\"Lolz!\" \"OMG!\") But the cult of personalisation is among the most infantalising of all.</p> <p>Many pieces of technology have an element of personalisation now, from phones with their screen savers of family photos, to Facebook pages that are decorated with more care than the master bedroom in Versailles, to Pinterest pages whimsically festooned with twee inspirational images. This is what happens when anthropomorphism meets narcissism in the capitalist world, and it is little more than a higher-tech version of the rubber-stamped cats I put on all my things when I was seven: \"Mine!\" \"Me!\" \"Me, me, me!\"</p> <p>Personalisation is, of course, very convenient for manufacturers as it creates the illusion that this phone, web page, this ruddy bank card, is your special cuddly item when it is nothing more than a bit of gadgetry that makes money for someone else. Mobile phones \u2013 which already feel like an extension of our bodies, an external and second, better brain \u2013 seem even more intimately part of (and, yes, bank man, an expression of) the owner when a personally significant photo is embedded on the dinky little screen, encouraging an emotional attachment with the phone itself which never happened when well-thumbed photos were carried about in battered wallets. Did you ever tape a Polaroid to your landline phone? No, you did not. That is what you are doing with a screensaver photo, only it's digital.</p> <p>Many people already talk about computers and phones as if they were people (\"It's thinking\"; \"It doesn't want to do that\"), an equation that feels all the more natural if a giant photo of your husband on holiday in Cornwall is staring at you from the background of your screen.</p> <p>But in the case of personalised bank cards, this particular bank has inadvertently played a clever card. We all must be extra-vigilant these days about how banks behave and to whom they lend money. The latter issue is neatly dealt with by these cards as anyone who gets their bank card personalised is basically saying: \"No, I have no concept what money is at all, me. A \u00a31,500 TV? Awww well, if it gives me an excuse to get out my cutesy-wootsy debit card, why not?\" Lolz.</p>",
  "<p>Talk about radical thinking! The Tories have announced a programme of shooting burglars, to ease the pressure on Britain's jails. It wasn't quite put like that, but the new justice secretary, Chris Grayling, said that even if people use force \"that in the cold light of day might seem over the top\", the law will be on their side \u2013 unless their response was \"grossly disproportionate\".</p> <p>This appears to mean that you can't kill them if they are already unconscious on the floor. And if they have barged into your home to sell you double glazing, or convert you to Mormonism, anything more than a few stab wounds would be unacceptable.</p> <p>Certainly a warning would be in order, possibly along these lines: \"This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful hand gun in the world. You gotta ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?\"</p> <p>Clearly, with burglars dying like slugs in a Magimix, there will be more space in the jails, and more money to retrain prisoners. (I especially like the idea that Timpsons are going to teach them the skills used in their shops. They will cut your spare keys. \"I'll need your address, love, just for the invoice.\")</p> <p>My anxiety would be that there could be an escalation of the burglars v householders arms race. Most of us keep a small arsenal at home, including kitchen knives and the odd Le Creuset. But burglars will arrive tooled up with swords, machetes, etc, so we will have to buy AK-47s and they will respond with rocket launchers. Grayling is certainly tough, as he admiringly described himself on Tuesday. Damian Green, the police minister, pointed out before his speech: \"Theresa used to lock 'em up and Ken would let 'em out. Now Theresa locks 'em up and Chris throws away the key!\"</p> <p>Tough times need tough ministers. Theresa May is also taking the pressure off the justice system. In some cases, crime victims will be able to choose the punishment for the criminals. If you are robbed, and have failed to terminate the malefactor with extreme prejudice, you'll be able to make a selection from several sanctions, either restorative or punitive, the home secretary said.</p> <p>Apparently this means merely that you'll be able to decree they should pay you back, apologise, or else send them off to paint an old folks home, pick up litter, or some such. But will victims think this is enough? Won't we face escalation there too? People will insist that the villains lick chewing gum off pavements. Then they will want waterboarding, followed by hanging upside down from hooks in meat storage facilities. Once you decide that the victims can decide the punishment according to the strength of their anger, there is no limit! And the death penalty will save even more prison space.</p> <p>Earlier we heard from Boris Johnson, who was much the most popular act of the day. Delegates asked themselves after his speech whether it was a leadership bid. How could it be, when he made such glowing references to David Cameron? What they did not understand was the metaphysical point that by his very existence Boris is a leadership bid, in and of himself. Everything he does is designed to mark him out as a future prime minister \u2013 his cleverness, his oratory, his jokes, his optimism, his connection to ordinary people. And if anyone missed this message, he rubbed it home: \"We [in London] overcame a 17-point poll lead, so I know David Cameron can win in 2015!\" In other words, \"unlike that loser, stuck in a coalition, I smashed the Labour party!\"</p> <p>Never forget that in a private talk to his supporters after the election, Boris said: \"We won in spite of the weather, the BBC, and even the support of David Cameron\" \u2013 and sent it as a text to Downing Street.</p>",
  "<p>The reported killing of the leader of the ferocious Zetas narco cartel, Heriberto Lazcano, by Mexican marines is a major coup for the armed forces battling the world's wildest criminal syndicates.</p> <p>If this is Lazcano, President Felipe Calder\u00f3n \u2013 who is nearing the end of a term marked by a catastrophic war against the cartels \u2013 will be able to claim with justification that it is a high point of his period in office. It also gives the incoming government of the rival PRI party new momentum to prosecute the war against the Zetas.</p> <p>Lazcano, right, filled a crucial role in the genealogy and tactics of Mexico's crime syndicates. He ranked high in the country's \u2013 and the world's \u2013 most wanted lists, along with Joaqu\u00edn \"Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, leader of the Zetas' rival gang, the vast Sinaloa cartel. But the two come from very different lineages and present the government with different challenges.</p> <p>Guzm\u00e1n is a modern incarnation of the \"old school\" mafia don, claiming the mantle of a family that ran narco trafficking for decades through a vicious, pyramidal structure. But the recent bloody history of Mexico's cartels has been one of constantly pushing the bounds of savagery, breaking down the old \"corporate\" nature of cartel control, with contacts in politics. The Zetas are the cartel of our time: their violence is perverse \u2013 almost innovative \u2013 in its cruelty, adept on the internet, unrelenting in every way.</p> <p>The Zetas were founded by Guzman's nemesis, Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n, as a paramilitary enforcement wing of the Gulf cartel, and they rapidly set new limits in violence and insurgent tactics. Lazcano was a key lieutenant, and after C\u00e1rdenas was arrested \u2013 he is now in jail in Texas \u2013 the Gulf cartel split and the Zetas became a cartel in their own right, under Lazcano's control.</p> <p>As such, they have pitched themselves wildly against every other criminal syndicate in the country \u2013 and many beyond, becoming Mexico's bridge to the European cocaine trade through an alliance with an Italian group, the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, which has mirrored their tactics.</p> <p>With a smaller narcotic base than Guzm\u00e1n from which to work, the Zetas expanded their business to take over migration rackets into the US. This led to the largest single massacre of the drugs war, the killing of 72 central Americans who, it is believed, refused to pay the Zetas' \"toll\" for illegally crossing the border. Under Lazcano's leadership their affairs included widespread extortion, kidnapping, prostitution and the export of stolen oil to the US. Lazcano's paramilitary troops even battle Guzm\u00e1n's men for cocaine trade routes through Guatemala and El Salvador, and have turned Mexico's showpiece cosmopolitan city, Monterrey \u2013 which thought itself immune \u2013 into a battleground.</p> <p>But there is no reason to suppose the scourge of violence will abate because of Lazcano's reported killing, and if it does, that the influence of the narco cartels will decline. For like Guzm\u00e1n's Sinaloa cartel, the Zetas are also taking territory. In several parts of Mexico police and even the political apparatus have come under their control \u2013 just as others are under Guzm\u00e1n's.</p> <p>One possible option available to Mexico's new president-elect, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of the PRI, is to do a deal of some sort with Guzm\u00e1n to secure a return to the old, pre-Calder\u00f3n \"order\", whereby a kind of conviviality existed between Guzm\u00e1n's family elders from Sinaloa and Guadalajara and the PRI's formidable political structure.</p> <p>The Sinaloa cartel, which has many clients in Mexico, is the only organisation with which any hope of such arrangements can lie, such has been the ferocity of the Zetas under Cardenas and Lazcarno.</p> <p>With the death of Lazcano, we can expect the war against the Zetas to be scaled up, and a bloody reaction from Lazcano's heirs to ensue. Guzm\u00e1n, meanwhile, will watch and wait for his moment.</p>",
  "<p>Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner's attempt to parachute to earth from the edge of space has been postponed for the second day running after gusty winds in New Mexico hampered the launch of the balloon that would take him skywards.</p> <p>Baumgartner, a 43-year-old former soldier, was aiming to jump from 23 miles above the Earth in a specially pressurised suit, plummetting to the ground at speeds that would break the sound barrier before he triggers his parachute.</p> <p>The stunt, if successful, would break five world records. Baumgartner would become the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; make the highest free-fall altitude jump, ride the highest manned balloon flight and longest free-fall and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history.</p> <p>Baumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of derring-do. The former paratrooper, known as \"Fearless Felix\" for reasons that need no explanation, has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. Baumgartner had already done two practise freefalls \u2013 one from 71,000 feet in March this year and a second from 97,000 feet in July.</p> <p>The jump was due to take place far above an airfield near the town of Roswell, which is famous for its UFO sighting. All had appeared well as Baumgartner donned his special suit, climbed into the capsule and then waited for the balloon to inflate. \"I am strapped into the capsule and I am ready to go,\" he had told the stunt's mission control team.</p> <p>However, as the slivery balloon began to be inflated it was buffeted by heavy winds and the mission was postponed. Depending on weather conditions, another attempt is likely to be made on Wednesday. Baumgartner, whose attempt is sponsored and run by the caffeinated drinks brand Red Bull, had postponed his first attempt on Monday, also after high winds.</p> <p>If successful Baumgartner's feat will raise the prospect that stricken astronauts might be able to survive a disaster of the type that hit the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 by actually bailing out of their craft. Baumgartner's top medical man in the stunt is Dr. Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts' chances of survival in a high-altitude disaster.</p>",
  "<p>Sharon Bowles, the Liberal Democrat MEP, has joined the race to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, saying she had applied for the \u00a3302,000-a-year role after encouragement from \"people in London\".</p> <p>Speaking from Brussels, Bowles told the Guardian she had \"reservations\" about the benefits of quantitative easing \u2013 the electronic printing of money.</p> <p>The increasingly powerful role of governor will oversee monetary policy, financial stability and banking regulation.</p> <p>\"It's a huge job that is going to have to be done in response to eurozone integration that is progressively going to threaten the single market in financial services \u2026 The governor is going to have to go out there and negotiate so we are not on the sidelines.\" A surprise candidate to succeed King, who will step down in June next year, Bowles said she had applied on Sunday evening \u2013 hours before the 8.30am deadline on Monday.</p> <p>Bowles, who chairs the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, will compete for the eight-year post with Financial Services Authority boss Lord Turner, deputy Bank governor Paul Tucker, and Sir John Vickers, who led the government's independent commission on banking. Lord Burns, currently chairman of Santander in the UK, is also regarded as a possible candidate. An Indian prisoner is said to have applied after reading the advert in the Economist.</p> <p>None of Bowles's main rivals is speaking publicly about their interest in the job, which is being advertised for the first time. However, Turner is due to address a City audience on Thursday in a speech at the Mansion House which will be closely monitored for any signals of how he might approach the governor's role.</p> <p>Bowles said her experience of Europe would demonstrate a \"change at the top\" of the Bank at a time when a new wave of financial regulation is coming from Brussels as it attempts to tackle the eurozone crisis. While she is a politician, Bowles describes her current role as chairing the economic and monetary affairs committee as \"95% apolitical\".</p> <p>\"We are going to have to negotiate and get a good relationship going between the Bank of England and the European Central Bank,\" Bowles said. An MEP since 2005, Bowles, who will not stand for re-election in 2014 when the current European parliament ends, began her career as a patent lawyer \u2013 and unusually for a potential Bank of England governor does not have a background in economics. But she was driven to politics in response to Lady Thatcher's economic approach in the 1980s.</p> <p><strong> </strong>\"I'm a physicist, a real economy person working with people doing patent applications. I could see the squeeze first-hand on them \u2026 I wanted to fight harder to keep manufacturing,\" she said.The Treasury refused to name the candidates and a spokesman said: \"The structure of the appointment process remains as set out by the chancellor.\"</p> <p>There is speculation King's successor will be named on 5 December, alongside the autumn statement.</p>",
  "<p>First, Mitt Romney threatened to cut funding to Big Bird. Now, in another campaign-strategy foul against the voters of tomorrow, his campaign has announced he has turned down a request to appear on Nickelodeon's election special. </p> <p>The children's channel launched the show, Kids Pick the President: The Candidates, in 1988. Candidates answer videotaped questions from children, and then viewers can vote for their choice of president in an online poll. In five of the past six presidential elections, child voters chose the same candidate as the eventual winner of the adult poll.</p> <p>President Barack Obama accepted an invitation to appear this year. Nickelodeon said it would use file clips of Romney addressing some of the issues raised in the questions posed by viewers.</p> <p>Linda Ellerbee, host of Nick News, said she was disappointed by the Romney team's decision.</p> <p>\"I would be equally disappointed if he had said yes and Obama said no,\" Ellerbee told the Guardian. \"It's not a personal thing, it's just a shame when both candidates don't see it as something important.\"</p> <p>Only two other presidential-hopefuls have refused invitations to the show. John Kerry declined the offer in 2004 and George W Bush withdrew in response. He had participated in 2000.</p> <p>The network said Nick News reached out to Romney several times since April, but his campaign told the program he couldn't fit the appearance in his schedule. </p> <p>\"I am still holding the door open until midnight October 14, I can work all night and cut the show and get him in. We'll meet him anywhere,\" Ellerbee said.</p> <p>The special will air on 15 October on Nickelodeon.</p> <p>Obama answered questions about the top campaign issues of this year's election for the special and responded to the kids' questions about jobs, same-sex marriage, illegal immigration and gun control. He also talked about heartbreak and his most embarrassing moment, said the network. </p> <p>\"Running into the wall is par for the course for me,\" the president said.&#xa0;\"I'm running into doors and desks all the time.\"</p> <p>Kids Pick the President sets out to increase children's understanding and awareness of the election, candidates and campaign issues and will announce the poll results on-air Monday, 22 October. </p> <p>The Romney campaign did not respond to requests for comment. </p> <p>In the first presidential debate last week, <a href=\"http://\">Romney provoked anger from another bastion of children's television</a> \u2013&#xa0;Sesame Street.

I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually I like you, too. But \u2026 I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for [it].\"</p> <p>This comment initiated waves of social media mockery and <a href=\"http://www.thirteen.org/insidethirteen/2012/10/04/pbs-statement-regarding-october-3-presidential-debate/\">prompted a defensive response from the network</a>. </p> <p>\"As a stated supporter of education, Governor Romney should be a champion of public broadcasting, yet he is willing to wipe out services that reach the vast majority of Americans, including underserved audiences, such as children who cannot attend preschool and citizens living in rural areas,\" PBS said.</p> <p>PBS also noted that most of their funding is provided by local member stations which raise their own money in addition to the federal funding they receive.</p>",
  "<p>The Mexican authorities have claimed one of their biggest victories against the notoriously bloody Zetas drug cartel, but admit they have lost the body of Heriberto Lazcano, the gang's brutal leader, who they say was killed in a shootout with the navy.</p> <p>Most of the original members of the Zetas cartel, which was formed in the 1990s, have been captured or killed, but Lazcano, who went by the nicknames \"el Lazca\" and \"the Executioner\", had appeared untouchable. The United States had offered $5m and the Mexican authorities $2.3m in rewards for information leading to his arrest.</p> <p>Authorities in the northern state of Coahuila were called out by the navy on Sunday at about 6pm to recover two bodies killed in a shootout near the town of Progreso, about 80 miles from the US border, the state's attorney general, Homero Ramos, told reporters on Tuesday.</p> <p>Ramos said the bodies were handed over to a local funeral parlour after being fingerprinted and photographed. Reading from a statement and refusing to answer questions, he added that the owner of the parlour had informed the authorities at about 8am on Monday that a masked and heavily armed unit had snatched both bodies.</p> <p>The Zetas are known for their strong esprit de corps, and often go to great lengths to recover the bodies of cartel members killed in clashes with other gangs and the authorities.</p> <p>Ramos did not say when the authorities realised that fingerprints taken from one of the cadavers matched those of Lazcano on a national database, and that photographs of the corpse matched descriptions of the trafficker.</p> <p>The navy released details of the prints along with two pictures of Lazcano's body, apparently taken on a morgue slab. This backed its earlier statement late on Monday that referred only to \"strong indications\" that it had killed Lazcano.</p> <p>It was left to Ramos to give details of the shootout, which he said began when a navy patrol tried to stop a suspicious vehicle near a baseball field. He said that after the driver of the vehicle was killed, the passenger got out and ran, but was shot dead about 300 metres away. The authorities said weapons recovered in the vehicle included two rifles, grenades, and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.</p> <p>The Zetas cartel is one of the main combatants in Mexico's horrific drug wars, which have killed more than 55,000 people since President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched a military-led offensive against organised crime nearly six years ago.</p> <p>Lazcano was one of the founders of the Zetas, which started out in the late 1990s as an enforcement unit within the Gulf cartel, formed from a core of deserters from an elite army unit. Born in 1975, Lazcano spent seven years in the army before deserting in 1998. He originally went by the codename Zeta 3.</p> <p>The Zetas later developed into a major cartel in their own right, known for the discipline of the military-style training and tactics they employed in battles with rivals and the authorities, as well as for the wide range of criminal activities they pursued alongside drug trafficking, such as the mass kidnapping of Central American migrants passing through Mexico and extensive extortion rackets.</p> <p>But the Zetas are probably most famous for the no-holds-barred brutality they employ to keep the territories they control docile, as well as during incursions into areas under the influence of rivals. While other cartels, most notably the Sinaloa cartel, headed by the infamous trafficker Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, regularly form alliances of convenience with other groups, the Zetas tend to go it alone.</p> <p>From late 2011 Calder\u00f3n made it clear that the Zetas were the most urgent target of his wider offensive against all the cartels, because of their extreme violence. The string of hits against the group has intensified in the past few weeks, with the pressure spiralling in Coahuila in particular after the murder of the son of a prominent politician was blamed on the group.</p> <p>The most recent arrest of a major Zeta operative came on Saturday when the navy captured Salvador Martinez Escobedo in Nuevo Laredo, just across the border from Laredo in Texas. The navy said Martinez, nicknamed \"the Squirrel\", had ordered the massacre of 72 migrants in Tamaulipas state in August 2010, among many other atrocities.</p> <p>Unofficial reports on Tuesday said Martinez had identified Lazcano from the photographs taken of one of the men killed in Sunday's shootout.</p> <p>In recent years Lazcano had shared the Zetas' leadership with another founding member, Miguel Angel Trevi\u00f1o Morales, known as \"Zeta 40\", although there had been some reports that the pair had split. Trevi\u00f1o Morales has a reputation that is even more bloody than Lazcano's.</p>",
  "<p>A hardline \"two strikes and you're out\" automatic life sentence for serious sexual or violent offences will be brought into force shortly, the self-proclaimed \"tough\" justice secretary, Chris Grayling, has told the Conservative party conference.</p> <p>The change, which will be brought in during December, will mean rapists and other criminals who commit a second serious violent or sexual offence will get a mandatory life sentence. Penal reformers have warned that the policy, which was imposed on Grayling's predecessor, Kenneth Clarke, by David Cameron, risks fuelling a fresh rise in the record prison population in England and Wales.</p> <p>\"Everyone deserves a second chance, but those who commit the most serious offences, crimes that would attract a sentence of 10 or more years, cannot be allowed to just go on and on causing harm, distress and injury,\" said Grayling. \"Those people are a real threat to our society, and we must treat them as such.\"</p> <p>His conference speech, with its \"back to basics\" headline announcements, marked a sharp break with Clarke's liberal criminal justice policies. Grayling, who explicitly promised to be a \"tough justice secretary\", confirmed he would strengthen the law on self-defence against burglars for householders, ensure there was a punitive element in all community sentences, and make much greater use of electronic tagging to enforce curfews and exclusion zones.</p> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, reinforced the theme with her announcement of a new \"pick a punishment\" power for victims of anti-social behaviour and her promise that Conservative candidates in the first elections for police and crime commissioners to be held on 15 November will have a \"laser-like focus on cutting crime\".</p> <p>The police minister, Damian Green, left no Conservative in the hall in any doubt that there had been a change of management at the ministry of justice when he joked: \"Theresa used to say she locked 'em up and Ken let them out. Now Theresa locks 'em up, and Chris throws away the key.\" Clarke's much trumpeted \"rehabilitation revolution\" barely got a mention during the hour and a half law and order presentation at the conference.</p> <p>Around the fringe the new prisons minister, Jeremy Wright, made clear that the change went deeper than rhetoric. He explained his view that some short prison sentences worked for some offenders and that Clarke's approach of trying to stabilise the 86,000 jail population by capping it was no longer official policy. The intention of \"putting some bite\" into community penalties will no longer be as an alternative to short prison sentences.</p> <p>\"I've made no bones about my intention to be a tough justice secretary. That means I want our justice system to be firm, fair and transparent,\" Grayling said.</p> <p>He said he would demonstrate that he was on the side of victims by changing the law on the use of force for people protecting their homes against intruders.</p> <p>Householders who hit out \"in the heat of the moment\" needed to be treated as victims, not criminals: \"That is why we are going to deal with this issue once and for all. I will shortly bring a change in to the law. It will mean that even if the householder faced with that terrifying situation uses force that in the cold light of day might seem over the top, unless that response is greatly disproportionate, the law will be on their side.\"</p> <p>In interviews he said that would mean that if a burglar had already been laid out cold then the householder would not be justified in then stabbing him.</p> <p>Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust warned of the impact on prison numbers of Grayling's new hardline approach: \"The question remains whether the new justice secretary can secure prison as an effective place of last resort for serious and violent offenders or whether his tough line will propel numbers out of control at enormous social and economic cost.\"</p> <p>Grayling also said he wanted to bring the same large-scale payment by results approach to work to cut reoffending as he had with the contracts to help the long-term unemployed through the Work Programme when he was employment minister. The justice secretary has put on hold both the reform of the probation service and the current payment by results pilot schemes while the details are worked out.</p> <p>May's \"pick a punishment\" scheme will involve the victims of the 232,000 offenders each year who are currently given an out-of-court caution for low-level offences. To be known as the community remedy, police and crime commissioners are to be given a new duty to offer such victims a \"menu of punishments\" to chose from. These may include paying compensation, repairing criminal damage or a restorative justice option.</p> <p>\"They will be given a list of options,\" said May. \"They might want something restorative or punitive. They might want it to be carried out nearby or as far away as possible. But what matters is that the punishment will be chosen by the victim.\"</p>",
  "<p>A judge in Hull has settled down with his law books to try to find the answer to the famous old question in the sea shanty: <a href=\"http://www.privateerdragons.com/caseys_shiphold1b.html\">what shall we do with the drunken sailor?</a></p> <p>Hull Crown court heard that the fate of Viatcheslav Poleshchuk, who crashed twice into <a href=\"http://www.abports.co.uk/Our_Locations/Hull_Goole/Goole/\">Goole lock gates </a>on the Humber and then asked police in a vodka-slurred voice \"Can I have another go?\", posed a legal brainteaser.</p> <p>The estuary's combined ports are the busiest in the country, and a skipper with a bottle of vodka freshly inside him, as Poleshchuk admitted he had, is no laughing matter in charge of a 30,000 tonne scrap metal carrier in such waters. The 44-year-old captain was more than four times over the <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Roadsafetyadvice/DG_195019\">drink-drive limit </a>with 157 milligrams of alcohol in his blood compared to the legal maximum of 35 when he was arrested last month.</p> <p>Officers found him looking glazed and unsteady on his feet and heard that he had refused to accept help from a local dock handler to ease the 100m-long <em>RMS Bell</em> out of its 105m berth. Prosecutor John Thackray said: </p> <blockquote> <p>He was warned how difficult it was but he would not listen. Eye-witnesses described him as being 'all over the place.'</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The court heard that it was not unusual for ships to hit the lock gates but it was rare for this to happen \"so forcefully and so hard.\" Judge Michael Mettyear told Poleshchuk, who admitted being over the alcohol limit for a ship's master: </p> <blockquote> <p>It is outrageous to be in charge of a great big vessel like this while over the drink limit. It is monstrous.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>He added that his instinct was \"a custodial sentence, but not a long one.\"</p> <p>A decision was deferred, however, after the skipper's barrister Paul Norton said in mitigation that marine case law for collision seldom included jail sentences. The court heard a brief rehearsal of drunken crashes at sea which had ended in prison terms, including a grounding in the Outer Hebrides and a collision with a North Sea oil rig, but in all cases and air-sea rescue had been necessary and lives had been put at risk. This was not the case in Goole.</p> <p>Northon said that Poleshchuk had drunk heavily before setting sail because the original departure date was a day later. He had intended to hand over to his first mate and go to bed as soon as the voyage was properly under way. </p> <p>Stuck in a Goole hotel pending the trial, he had also lost his master's certificate and had a wife and two children at home at Rostov in Russia. They had offered to wire \u00a35000 if the court was thinking of a fine.</p> <p>Deferring final sentence, Judge Mettyear sent Poleshchuk down for a week. He then told the court that he needed more time to research case law on drunken captains, as well as waiting for confirmation of the money transfer.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qGyPuey-1Jw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qGyPuey-1Jw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Here is a YouTube clip of the shanty which has been watched more than seven million times; and this website has <a href=\"http://ingeb.org/songs/whatshal.html\">a version in Latin</a>.

  "<p>Newcastle United's \u00a324m four-year sponsorship deal with Wonga, the high interest, short-term \"payday\" loan company, has been greeted by a storm of protest from MPs, campaigners against debt and supporters.</p> <p>Derek Llambias, the club's managing director, said the deal will provide money for the club's youth academy and community work, as well as to boost the first team. It emerged on Tuesday that the deal also includes naming rights for the club's stadium although Wonga will restore the Sports Direct Arena to its traditional name, St James' Park.</p> <p>\"We are building a club that can regularly compete for top honours at the highest level,\" Llambias said. \"As everyone knows, a strong commercial programme is vital to this goal and I am delighted to welcome Wonga into the fold as our lead commercial partner.\"</p> <p>The backlash began even before Newcastle confirmed they had signed the deal with Wonga, whose loans charge interest at an average annual percentage rate of 4,214%. Wonga says although that figure is accurate, it does not represent the reality of its loans, which are for a maximum 30 days at 1% interest a day, with compound interest not being charged as for the APR calculation.</p> <p>However Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, who has for two years led a campaign against Wonga, including its sponsorship of the Blackpool and Hearts football clubs, describes payday loan companies as \"legal loan sharks\". She wants the government to impose a legal cap on lending rates, at much lower than&#xa0;4,214%, as happens in most other European countries.</p> <p>In July the Football Supporters' Federation called on the football authorities to ban Wonga from advertising or sponsorship until such regulation of the industry comes into force. Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, said he was \"appalled and sickened\" that Newcastle would \"sign a deal with a legal loan shark\".</p> <p>Northumberland and Newcastle MPs including Ian Lavery, MP for Wansbeck, and Chi Onwurah, MP for Newcastle Central, also expressed outrage. \"Some of the richest young men in Newcastle to wear shirts calling on the poorest to go to a legal loan shark,\" Onwurah tweeted.</p> <p>Michael Martin, a lifelong Newcastle supporter and editor of the long-established True Faith fanzine, said the sponsorship was \"shameful\" and \"I really don't understand what the club is about any&#xa0;more\".</p> <p>The Muslim Council of Britain hopes Newcastle respect the wishes of any Muslim players who ask to wear the shirt without the sponsor's name. Under Sharia law giving or receiving interest is forbidden.</p> <p>Four Muslim players \u2013 Demba Ba, Papiss Ciss\u00e9, Cheik Tiot\u00e9 and Hatem Ben Arfa \u2013 started against Manchester United on Sunday. \"Assuming all four are on the pitch at the same time, if you have seven out of 11 [with the sponsor on their shirts] you have sufficient coverage,\" Shaykh Ibrahim Mogra, assistant secretary general of the MCB, told the Independent. \"It is not asking too much, I believe.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 October 2012.

  "<p>HTC, the world's fifth biggest phone maker, has suffered a 79% crash in quarterly profits as the popularity and marketing muscle of Apple and Samsung continue to squeeze out smaller rivals.</p> <p>Third quarter net income plummeted to 4.9bn New Taiwan dollars (\u00a3104m) in the three months to the end of September, from NT$20bn in the same period last year, according to unaudited results published on Monday night. Revenues were down 48% to NT$70.2bn, well below analyst expectations of NT$75bn.</p> <p>Only a year ago the Taiwanese company was enjoying a record quarter with revenues of NT$136bn, thanks to bestselling handsets including the HTC Desire and Sensation.</p> <p>HTC will only comment when its audited results are published, but an email sent by the chief executive, Peter Chou, to employees in August urged staff to \"kill bureaucracy\". He complained: \"We have people in meetings and talking all the time but without decision, strategic direction and sense of urgency.\"</p> <p>Sales of HTC's flagship One series, which debuted in February, are trailing off as Apple and Samsung spend four to six times more on marketing to ensure the iPhone 5 and the Galaxy SIII dominate the market, while strongly subsidising their older models, according to the analyst Pierre Ferragu at the broker Sanford C Bernstein.</p> <p>\"HTC is entering a vicious circle of market share loss and gross margin erosion that reflects continued loss of traction with consumers,\" said Ferragu in a note. \"We see a market where Apple and Samsung fight hard in terms of commercial and marketing execution to defend their respective positions, with both providing aggressive launch support for their flagship phones and strong distribution support for older models. These distribution dynamics leave almost no room for HTC to remain visible in the market.\"</p> <p>HTC's share of the global smartphone market by shipments fell to 5.8% in the second quarter from 10.7% a year earlier, according to Bloomberg. The company released its first Windows Phone 8 models in September, its most high-profile pre-Christmas launch, but Microsoft's operating system has yet to establish itself as a serious third player after Google's Android and Apple's iOS.</p> <p>HTC's revenues, profits and handset shipments peaked in the third quarter of 2011 and began falling in the fourth quarter of 2011, when Apple and Samsung increased their efforts to control the US market.</p> <p>\"Samsung is the reason HTC is struggling,\" said Francisco Jeronimo at the research firm IDC. \"HTC devices are good, the brand is strong and they keep on innovating, but Samsung invests significantly more at the point of sale compared with HTC.\"</p> <p>HTC has seen falling average selling prices for its phones as it has tried to break into the fast-growing Chinese market. Approximately 30% of shipments go to China but price pressures mean they account for only 20% of revenues.</p> <p>Carolina Milanesi, a smartphones analyst at Gartner, another research company, said HTC needed to concentrate on sales to big \"enterprise\" businesses where \"bring your own device\" (BYOD) policies were in place: \"It seems to me that on the Android side, they tried to go for the low end to get [market] share, but that did not work much, and now they want to go back to their core. In Android I think they should become an enabler of BYOD \u2013 so focus on making Android a better platform to bring into the enterprise.\" Samsung has tried to do that but so far \"not made much inroad\", she suggested. \"I believe that HTC would have a better chance at that, as this is where they started,\" Milanesi said. \"They knew how to do it.\" HTC started out as a contract manufacturer making white-label smartphones running Microsoft's Windows Mobile software, and then created its own brand.</p> <p>Milanesi suggested that now its Windows Phone models would not be its salvation: \"The Microsoft [Windows Phone] phones are good, but they risk being swallowed in the Microsoft PR machine. HTC needs to push the envelope on innovation. It seems to me that on that side they have not had an industry first for a while. They used to lead with connectivity and integration, but have not done so in a while. They need to be more vocal about their brand, and consistent in their message \u2013 so they talk more about the company and the differentiation on their devices, building a story on who they are as a company.\"</p>",

The band claim as influences Daft Punk and Def Leppard, which is interesting, because wasn't one of the DP albums meant to contain affectionate pastiches of lite metal? Meanwhile, singer Andrew Wagstaff's vocals are said to \"have something of the manner of Deep Purple's Ian Gillan and ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons\", although to us they sound more like the Human League's Phil Oakey.</p> <p>Anyway, the best thing you can say about the Winter Olympics is that they're pleasantly confusing, and the worst that they're mired in the drab sounds they're supposed to be condoning or condemning (with minus points for not being clear whether they're doing one or the other). The woah-oh chorus on opener Regional Showcase seems to be implying how easy this catchy indie pabulum is to knock out, but the supercilious tone is undercut by a sense of a band who would give their eye teeth for even the lowliest indie success. I Prefer the Early Stuff is grungy indie-pop and, like most of the music here, catchy but not in a particularly good way. This Is the Fourth Time (I Have Been in Your House) is quite amusing, like Nirvana's Come As You Are sung by a deranged sociology undergrad pissed on snakebite. There is no discernible punchline, unless we're being thick. Fags and Girls, about the travails of giving up both (\"Think of the money I'm saving / You smell amazing\"), is like being force-fed fun.</p> <p>It's poignant, in a way, the era of this kind of barracking, barnstorming indie having long since passed \u2013 time was when students would have gleefully punched the air to this stuff even as you longed to punch the singer. That sense of wanting to take the piss out of a party that ended long ago reaches a peak on I Miss the Nineties, wherein Wagstaff longs for all that decade's greats from Sega Mega Drive and Eric Cantona to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/129510/bill-and-ted-s-excellent-adventure\" title=\"\">Bill and Ted</a> (\"they were excellent\") and Melody Maker. That last reference, to the defunct music weekly, is most telling \u2013 for all the musical approximations of Euro-house (Feeling European) and hair metal (Heavy Metal Ending), Profit and Loss is the kind of knowing wink-winkery that appeals to journalists but is a bit too clever but conversely not quite clever enough to catch on with real people.

  "<p>New York is a leader in the legislative fight against sexual harassment in the subways, and its newest proposition is <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/22/proposed-legislation-would-make-subway-grinding-a-class-b-felony-with-jail-time/\">a law that aims to upgrade unwanted sexual contact</a> from a misdemeanor to a felony. The escalation also turns \"sexually motivated touching\" into a sex crime with the possibility of jail time. I applaud lawmakers' effort to address this critical issue, but I am not convinced that harsher punishments for sexual harassment on the subway will yield the desired effect.</p> <p>The most lamentable aspect of taking public transportation as a woman is enduring the unsavory boys and men who exploit the shared space and put our safety in jeopardy. <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5837687/a-guy-jerked-off-to-me-on-the-subway-and-nypd-didnt-do-a-thing\">Masturbation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/issues/sexually-assaulted-on-the-nyc-subway\">sexual assault</a>, <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2012/02/10/cops_woman_raped_in_bowery_j_train.php\">rape</a> and <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/05/nypd-suspect-placed-genitals-on-womans-hand-in-brooklyn-subway-train/\">whatever you call what this guy was doing</a> are the more invasive (not to mention illegal) behaviors that disrupt our journeys. Women understand that most men don't engage in this brand of sexual violence, and we applaud the <a href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8538713\">many men</a> who take action <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P4eVjwVd_U\">to disrupt</a> this injustice when it occurs. But the number of guys who are doing these things is sizable enough to make most women suspicious and uneasy during our commutes.</p> <p>Subway harassment isn't only a problem for women in New York City: Boston, Chicago and, recently, Washington, DC have all implemented <a href=\"http://www.fem2pt0.com/2012/07/24/feeling-safer-on-the-metro-wmatas-anti-sexual-harassment-campaign/\">ad campaigns</a> to raise awareness about the issue and encourage riders to report incidents. And across the globe in Beijing, a furious debate erupted in August after the Shanghai No 2 Metro Operation Company issued a public statement <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-08/23/content_15699540.htm\">blaming harassment on women who wear sexy clothing</a>. Transportation in cities in Egypt, Japan and India have women-only sections, where the hope is that separation might actually equal increased public safety. Still, the problem persists across cultures and national borders.</p> <p>By the time women <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/06/13/police-suspect-sexually-assaulted-15-year-old-at-fort-hamilton-subway-station/\">become teens</a>, we are intimately familiar with the dangers that come with entering public space. (Though, let's be real, our <a href=\"http://www.bookslut.com/nonfiction/2011_06_017760.php\">homes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aauw.org/learn/research/upload/CrossingTheLine.pdf\">schools</a> and <a href=\"http://truth-out.org/military-sexual-abuse-greater-menace-combat/1327533957\">workplaces</a> aren't that safe either.) We've been harassed and assaulted. We've been <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/issues/sexually-assaulted-on-the-nyc-subway\">dismissed by police</a> after being harassed and assaulted. We've been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/nyregion/for-women-in-street-stops-deeper-humiliation.html?_r=1&amp;smid=fb-share\">harassed and assaulted by police</a>.

We've <a href=\"http://truth-out.org/news/item/11196-no-justice-when-women-fight-back\">been jailed for defending ourselves</a> against harassment and assault.</p> <p>For women, as a Bengali idiom deftly states, there's a tiger on land and a crocodile in the water. </p> <p>When lawmakers <a href=\"http://www.masstransitmag.com/news/10767308/ny-mta-revenue-loss-states-responsibility\">cut taxes on the wealthy that fund public transportation</a>, it results in service decreases that mean riders spend more time in the transit system. It also leads to layoffs of transit employees who could be monitoring safety and holding violators accountable for infractions. Instead, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subway-Crime-Rise-Smart-Phone-Robberies-Subway-Crime-Increase-152349385.html\">crime is increasing in the New York City subways</a>, not because our laws aren't tough enough already, but because the ones that exist aren't adequately enforced.</p> <p>Hence, my skepticism about the effectiveness of the newly proposed legislation.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/news/2012-09-22/de-blasio-savino-and-cusick-announce-legislation-cracking-down-sexual-offenders\">statement from Public Advocate Bill de Blasio's office reads</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The City Police Department receives over 1,000 complaints a year for public lewdness or forcible touching.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Only 1,000 complaints? In 2011, the <a href=\"http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffsubway.htm\">New York weekday subway ridership averaged 5.3m</a>. With millions of women taking the subway every day, the number of complaints police receive seems implausibly, worryingly low.</p> <p>According to a 2007 survey about sexual violence in the subway conducted by the Manhattan borough president's office, <a href=\"http://www.nyfst.org/hiddeninplainsight.pdf\">only 4% of people who are sexually harassed</a> on the subway report the incident. This finding fueled a citizen-led advocacy effort that prompted <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/02/02/mta-tells-riders-to-stay-alert-in-new-public-service-announcement/\">public service announcements</a> on buses and trains. But five years later, the numbers still strongly suggest that a majority of violated riders do not make formal complaints.</p> <p>In a climate where Republican elected officials make scientifically unsound statements about \"<a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/08/19/gop-senate-nominee-women-dont-get-pregnant-from-legitimate-rapes/\">legitimate rape</a>\" and blame an 11-year-old gang rape victim \"<a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/03/16/republican-lawmaker-blames-11-year-old-victim-of-alleged-gang-rape/\">because she was dressed like a 21-year-old prostitute</a>\", it's no surprise that victims of sexual violence choose to remain silent. They may post blurry cellphone photos on blogs with semi-anonymous stories of outrage, but precious few resort to the institutional mechanisms that have been established to ensure their safety. Until we get to the root of what the barriers are and take the steps necessary to remove them, creating harsher legislation is simply spinning wheels.</p> <p>Some groups, like <a href=\"http://www.collectiveactiondc.org/\">Collective Action for Safe Spaces</a> (Cass), are already leading the way by drawing on local expertise and creating strategic, community-driven, innovative solutions addressing the issues that impact on one's willingness to report a crime. Recognizing street harassment as a complex and multifaceted issue: Cass takes a comprehensive approach by combining direct services, online and offline advocacy, grassroots movement-building and education and training. It <a href=\"http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/2012/09/metro-anti-harassment-skit/\">works in coalition</a> with other likeminded organizations in our nation's capital, and it is creating a model that can be adapted elsewhere in the US and the world.</p> <p>Our right to be secure in public spaces is at the forefront of <a href=\"http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/resources/online/\">justice movements all over the globe</a>. It's exciting to know that, one day, this blight affecting us all will come to an end, not as a result of tougher laws, but because concerned citizens are standing up and demanding the right to live more dignified lives.</p>",
  "<p>Virgin Trains and the Department for Transport have been locked in talks over the immediate future of the west coast mainline after the transport secretary said he would rather leave the railways in private hands.</p> <p>A decision is expected by the end of the week, with Patrick McLoughlin due to give a statement to parliament when it returns from recess on Monday.</p> <p>The choice for the running of the lucrative London to Scotland line, after Virgin's current contract expires on 9 December, appears to be either a management contract for the incumbent or allowing the state-owned Directly Operated Railways (DOR) to step in. However, with DOR running the east coast line, there is believed to be anxiety within the government at the idea of having Britain's two major rail arteries being, in effect, state-run, with Labour increasingly open to the idea of renationalisation.</p> <p>Talks are believed to be focusing on the hard cash involved and the legal ramifications of awarding a contract to Virgin without a tender.</p> <p>Indications from FirstGroup are that while legal action remains an option, it is unlikely to launch any lawsuit soon. Sir Richard Branson, owner of Virgin, had offered to run the service for free but his company has made it clear that circumstances have changed.</p> <p>McLoughlin reiterated his commitment to the principle of franchising at the Conservative party conference. \"My objective is not to retreat back but to use the marketplace and its ingenuity to deliver a railway that people are happy with and content to use,\" he said.</p> <p>But he admitted the timetable for resolving the crisis within the department was slipping, as the report by Sam Laidlaw, non-executive director of the Department for Transport, into the lessons of the west coast franchise fiasco is unlikely to be delivered by the end-of-October deadline. Richard Brown's report on wider implications for the franchising process, on which a series of forthcoming contracts will depend, is due by the new year but will be heavily influenced by Laidlaw's conclusions.</p> <p>Questions are being asked about the roles of the three transport secretaries presiding over the franchising debacle, with Philip Hammond, Justine Greening's predecessor, holding the reins when the flawed GDP resilience model was built.</p> <p>The department believes its calculations are at the root of the errors that led to last week's scrapping of the award to FirstGroup at a cost to taxpayers of more than \u00a340m in instant compensation to bidders.</p> <p>While McLoughlin has not ordered any fresh look at the departmental forecasting that underpinned the case for high speed rail, he warned that people should \"never underestimate the courts\" as the HS2 project also faces calls for a judicial review, with a hearing in December.</p> <p>He said he hoped to work with Labour to get cross-party consensus on legislation to be included in the next Queen's Speech and taken through parliament before the 2015 general election. He said he would \"love to\" complete the project within five years, although he accepted it will probably take longer.</p>",
  "<p>At the very moment the Football Association was finally opening St George's Park, centre for the sporting values modern football was always supposed to embody, one of England's great clubs, Newcastle United, unveiled a shirt sponsorship by the short-term, high-interest \"payday\" loan company, Wonga.</p> <p>It emerged following late negotiations on Tuesday morning that the deal will now also include naming rights to Newcastle's stadium and, in a move designed to soften supporters' expected antagonism to Wonga, the ground will be called St James' Park again.</p> <p>Both Newcastle and Wonga strove to portray the four-year, \u00a324m deal as a great benefit to the team, youth academy and even the club's community work \u2013 but the outcry against it assailed St James' Park.</p> <p>Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, who has for two years led a campaign against Wonga and other payday finance companies she accuses of \"legal loan sharking\", said: \"It is only through preying on families struggling to make ends meet that Wonga has made enough money to be able to sign this deal with Newcastle.\"</p> <p>She was joined by the local MPs Ian Mearns, Catherine McKinnell, Ian Lavery and the MP for Newcastle Central, Chi Onwurah, who also described Wonga as a \"legal loan shark\". Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, called the sponsorship \"disgraceful\" and said Newcastle's deal to wear Wonga on their shirts would \"undermine all the work we are doing to crack down on legal loan sharking\".</p> <p>Michael Martin, a lifelong Newcastle supporter and editor of the long-established True Faith fanzine, described the deal as \"shameful\" and said it \"tarnishes the club's name, image and reputation\".</p> <p>With its jokey name and knowing marketing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/01/wonga-real-cost-payday-loan\" title=\"\">Wonga has become the most visible company making \"payday\" loans, whose use is growing exponentially in the recession</a>. The interest on Wonga's loans, one per cent a day, calculates over a year to an astonishing annual percentage rate (APR) of 4,214%.</p> <p>Creasy's campaign calls on the government to cap interest, as is the practice in other European countries \u2013 France, for example, imposes a maximum of 21.63%; Germany 16.4%.</p> <p>In the last financial year, to December 2011, Wonga more than tripled its income to \u00a3184m, and made \u00a359m profit, from around 2.5m payday loans. The company is now planning an aggressive expansion of its operations; it already sponsors the Championship club Blackpool, and Hearts in Scotland, but the \u00a324m committed to Newcastle from 2013-17 will launch the Wonga name to a dramatically wider audience.</p> <p>Concern about the financial difficulties suffered by already struggling people who take out high-interest loans has been expressed by the Consumers' Association, Citizens Advice, and by R3, the national membership body for insolvency professionals. Lee Manning, the R3 president, responded to the news of Wonga's sponsorship by saying \"high-cost credit\" adds to debt problems of people suffering financial difficulty, particularly in the north-east, where Newcastle are an iconic institution.</p> <p>Official figures show the north-east has a higher personal bankruptcy rate than any other region in the country, that 26% struggle financially to make it to pay day, and an R3 survey found 70% \"are concerned about their current level of debt\". Loans such as those made available by Wonga are termed \"payday\" because they are often used by people struggling to make ends meet before they get paid. Referring to the Newcastle sponsorship, Manning said: \"Wonga has chosen to target a region that has comparatively high numbers of people experiencing financial difficulty. Many of those seeking high-cost credit need professional advice for their financial problems, rather than accruing further debt.\"</p> <p>Wonga itself argues that although the 4,214% APR figure is accurate, it does not fairly reflect its interest rate. The company points out its maximum loan term is 30 days \u2013 extended to 60 for late payers \u2013 and it charges 1% interest every day of a loan, not \"compound interest\" in which interest is charged on interest. Consumer credit law, though, requires all companies to state a typical APR, and on Wonga's average loan, \u00a3176, which is paid off on average after 16 days, at a cost of \u00a334.14 in interest and fees, the APR does amount to 4,214%.</p> <p>The company portrays its borrowers as young people exercising free choice, and says 84% pay their loans off on time or early, meaning 16% fall into arrears. However, an R3 survey last year found that 60% of people who took out a payday loan regretted having to do so, and 32% could not pay it off, so had to take out another one.</p> <p>Derek Llambias, Newcastle's managing director who, with the club's owner, Mike Ashley, has made great strides to win over supporters since Newcastle's low point of relegation in 2009, depicted the deal as one whose cash would help Newcastle compete in the Premier League.</p> <p>\"Wonga's desire to help us invest in our young playing talent, the local community and new fan initiatives really impressed us and stood them apart from other candidates,\" he said. \"I am delighted to welcome Wonga into the fold as our lead commercial partner.\"</p> <p>It was not evident, however, that Llambias was quite ready for the level of dislike for Wonga, and the opposition which would greet the deal. Until Tuesday morning the agreement did not include the stadium, which was branded with Ashley's retail company, Sports Direct, until a naming rights buyer was found. Wonga's inclusion of the naming rights was then agreed, with the restoration of the St James' Park name seen as a PR move, because it is cherished by supporters.</p> <p>Newcastle have also landed themselves in an already existing campaign specifically targeting Wonga's use of football for marketing. In July, delegates to the Football Supporters' Federation fans' parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution which called on the football authorities to ban sponsorship by payday loan companies until they are subjected to tighter regulation and an interest rate cap.</p> <p>The campaign, supported by Creasy, was begun by Bob Ward, a Northampton Town supporter, with an open letter to the Guardian in March. Signed by supporters from 18 clubs, it targeted Wonga's advertising on all Football League clubs' websites, a deal which has now ended. Ward said they plan to leaflet fans at Blackpool's matches with information about Wonga, and now intend to do the same at Newcastle's.</p> <p>\"We know where that \u00a324m for Newcastle is coming from \u2013 many poor and vulnerable people paying appallingly high interest,\" Ward said. \"Football clubs should promote good messages \u2013 perhaps responsible lenders like credit unions, not dreadful exploitation like this.\"</p> <p>On the day the FA's national football centre was opened at last, a home for coaching and sporting development, Newcastle were telling a more complex story about modern football. Follow the money: high interest paid by people struggling to stay afloat, paid ultimately to millionaire footballers, who will wear Wonga on their shirts to promote more payday loans. Not, perhaps, the most inspirational message for what was once the people's game.</p>",

Click to view</a></p> <p>If, like me, you are wondering which Bret Easton Ellis is likely to turn up for The Canyons \u2013 the trigger-happy chappy who sprays ideas about the Twitterverse like Jackson Pollock, or the rather more measured, precise author of Less Than Zero and American Psycho \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLO6FmfveQ4&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">the first trailer proper for the film</a> offers some pretty blatant clues. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbgmai_DLHo\" title=\"\">A previous teaser for Easton Ellis's collaboration with director Paul Schrader</a>, billed as a contemporary LA-set noir, gave us scattershot images of the city of angels, with barely a human being in sight. This time around, we get our first glimpse of stars Lindsay Lohan and James Deen in the form of a grindhousey trailer that just screams throwaway sleaze. \"Where the sex is as cheap as the budget \u2026 and the only way out is death!\" it shouts, before inexplicably referencing Deen's famously humungous package. The whole thing may be tastefully done and beautifully shot, but it still feels like the ultimate example of an \"it seemed like a good idea at the time\" approach to film promotion.</p> <p>Does it say much about the movie itself, beyond flagging up the exploitation-tinged nature of a project we already know is going to be mostly about sex (check out some of the auditions on the movie's <a href=\"https://letitcast.com/en/auditions/14690?best_of=2099676293\" title=\"\">Letitcast page for a taste of the movie's dialogue</a>)? Or is the trailer just another example of the increasingly unhinged influence of the same Easton Ellis who thought it would be a really good idea to hire an erratic pop-culture princess and an erstwhile porn star for the project? The Canyons has been been paid for largely by the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform, without studio support, giving the creative team freedom to do exactly as they please without having to get permission from the studio suits. Hence, if Easton Ellis and Schrader fancy promoting the film with a wacky (if admittedly well done) Russ Meyer-style trailer whose retro style is unlikely to be mirrored in the 2012-set movie itself, that's exactly what they get to do.</p> <p>The writer took to Twitter earlier on Tuesday <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/09/fifty-shades-grey-hires-terra-nova-writer\" title=\"\">to berate the producers of the forthcoming Fifty Shades of Grey movie</a>, for hiring the creator of cancelled sci-fi show Terra Nova instead of him to write the film's screenplay. <a href=\"http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2012/10/bret-easton-ellis-slams-50-shades-writer-producer-calls-the-cany/#ixzz28oF27oGk\" title=\"\">Fifty Shades producer Dana Brunetti swiftly hit back</a>, tweeting: \"@BretEastonEllis Really, Bret? The day you release that 'trailer'. School film? You're losing it.\" He also retweeted another post which read: \"I love Brett Easton Ellis... I love Paul Schrader... THE CANYONS looks like the worst student film ever made.\"</p> <p>Personally, I would rather see Easton Ellis's take on \"mommy porn\" than British writer Kelly Marcel's proposed adaptation any day of the week, but you can see why the former didn't get the job. The Canyons' stunt casting and offbeat trailers all point to an overriding air of self-indulgence at the heart of a movie which already feels like Easton Ellis's personal plaything, something to pass the hours and ease ennui, rather than a work he expects to last the test of time. It's as if the writer's habit of hanging out on Twitter, a space where unfiltered, ill-considered ideas are celebrated like lost Shakespeare plays, has irrevocably affected his artistic modus operandi. Then again perhaps Schrader, writer of Taxi Driver and director of the sex-obsessed American Gigolo and Cat People (the brilliantly camp 1982 remake), is keeping a tighter rein on the movie itself than he is on the trailers. What do you think?</p>",
  "<p>A film adaptation of Salman Rushdie's prizewinning novel Midnight's Children is to be shown in the author's native land.</p> <p>There had been fears no local distributors would risk controversy and buy rights to the film. However Kamal Gianchandani, head of Mumbai-based PVR Pictures, told the Times of India he had seen Midnight's Children at the Toronto International film festival last month and was <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/news-interviews/Midnights-Children-set-to-release-in-India/articleshow/16735469.cms\" title=\"\">aiming for a December release</a>.</p> <p>Cinema experts in the subcontinent had said the apparent failure to find a distributor suggested a weakness in Indian democracy.</p> <p>The newspaper quoted Ronit Roy, who acts in the film, as saying the deal showed that \"India has come of age\".</p> <p>The adaptation, scripted by Rushdie, follows the narrative of the original novel and includes unflattering portrayals of senior Indian political figures. Distributors appeared fearful of offending powerful politicians or sparking controversy.</p> <p>\"I think it is wonderful,\" said one local critic, who did not want to be named. \"It's very brave [of PVR], because it's Rushdie and because of the local angle. Anything to do with Salman can just spiral out of control. But it's a movie that should be seen here.\"</p> <p>PVR had a history of bringing \"eclectic independent films\" into India, the critic &#xa0;said.</p> <p>Rushdie's relationship with India has often been troubled: his 1988 book The Satanic Verses, which provoked a fatwa from the Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini calling for the author's killing, is still banned in India.</p> <p>In January an appearance by Rushdie, 65, at the Jaipur literary festival had to be cancelled after protests from Indian Muslim groups. The incident provoked fears for free speech in India and criticism of the government.</p> <p>Midnight's Children was published to great acclaim in 1981 and won the Booker prize that year. It describes the life of a boy born with magical powers at the exact moment of India gaining its independence in 1947.</p> <p>Its unflattering portrayal of the then prime minister Indira Gandhi and her suspension of democracy in India between 1975 and 1977, a period known as The Emergency, led to the author being sued for defamation by the premier in 1984. Gandhi won the case shortly before her assassination that year and the publishers were forced to slightly alter the text to remove an offending passage.</p> <p>The current president of the ruling Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, is the widow of Indira Gandhi's son Rajiv. Her son, Rahul, is seen as a potential prime minister.</p> <p>An Indian reviewer compared the Indira Gandhi portrayed in the film adaptation to a \"Lord Voldemort-like politician with dark grey clouds hanging over her head\".</p> <p>The Press Trust of India criticised the film for its \"exotic India package \u2013 snake charmers in red turbans, magicians who say abracadabra and slum dwellers who speak pukka English\". Other reviews have been more positive.</p> <p>Producers did not seek permission to film in India, choosing instead to make the movie, directed by respected Indian-Canadian film maker Deepa Mehta, in Sri&#xa0;Lanka.</p>",
  "<p>Not speaking in any official capacity here. Not as an NPR host, not as an employee of WNYC, not even as a co-conspirator to undermine American values with liberal bias and too many stories about the third world, modern dance and kelp. I write this, basically, as an earthling with the capacity for reason.</p> <p>The issue is the ongoing funding of public broadcasting, a reliable hot button of the culture wars. <a href=\"http://www.conservativeactionalerts.com/\">Conservative Action Alerts</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"NPR is notorious for being a leftwing propaganda machine. Do you really want your tax dollars going to fund such a media outlet?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>(Suggested answer: <em>NO! That is tyranny!</em>) That sentiment is often accompanied by talk of economic extremis \u2013 that we simply can't afford the expense of informing, educating and culturally enriching our nation. For instance, Senator Jim DeMint (Republican, South Carolina) and Representative Doug Lamborn (Republican, Colorado) have called for the <a href=\"http://cnsnews.com/news/article/demint-and-lamborn-defund-npr-and-pbs\">Corporation for Public Broadcasting to be defunded in 2013</a>. \"While so many Americans are making sacrifices around the country to make ends meet,\" they wrote, \"CPB appears unwilling to do the same.\"</p> <p>Still other critics, notably Newt Gingrich, argue that the private sector (that is, cable) uses the glorious free market to fulfil that mission. The Learning Channel, for instance. The History Channel. National Geographic.</p> <p>Hey, let's begin there. The commercial alternative is a fetching idea that collapses absolutely at once, because the free market is a bit lacking, shall we say, mission-wise, with a tendency toward the lowest common denominator. TLC, the erstwhile Learning Channel, trades in such fare as Half-Ton Killer, a documentary about an obese murder suspect. The History Channel offers Pawn Stars. National Geographic: Family Guns and Women's Prison.</p> <p>Presidential candidate Mitt Romney says he loves Big Bird. He has not weighed in on Women's Prison.</p> <p>As for commercial radio, the biggest stars are Howard Stern, who presides over a junior high school locker-room, and Rush Limbaugh, who is a bigot, a demagogue and a liar. And as for so-called TV news, well, locate me some news on American commercial television, then we can maybe discuss it.</p> <p>Now then: cost. The obvious response to the budgetary argument is that the federal tax dollars \u2013 mainly the $445m allocated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \u2013 amount to 0.015 of 1% of the $3.2tn federal budget. Yeah, let's zero out that 1.5/10,000; that'll balance the budget.</p> <p>Congress spends 10 times that sum on <em>itself</em> \u2013 and there are exactly 535 member of Congress (yes, $9m per person.) By way of comparison, about 170 million Americans consume public broadcasting. So you're saying Sesame Street and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/\">Morning Edition</a> are unaffordable luxuries? Here's a thought: shut up.</p> <p>Just a brief word about liberal propaganda. Having spent 25 years in public radio, I have zero doubt that the news staff is overwhelmingly liberal, as is the case in most of the mainstream media. This has to do not with propaganda or \"agenda\", but with the overlapping values of liberalism and journalism. They share suspicion of power, the impulse for reform, the sanctity of the commonweal and a worldview that looks outward, not inward.</p> <p>What is difficult for many to understand is that the overlap does not represent ideology; it represents mentality. It is a way of looking at the world that has a lot to do with engaging many ideas and very, very little to do with doctrine. Why, I remember when there were liberal Republicans \u2013 a category long since banned by the GOP leadership.</p> <p>As for the reporting itself, has Jim DeMint <em>listened</em> to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/\">All Things Considered</a>? Could it be any more apolitical? If anything, NPR and <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/\">PBS's NewsHour</a> bend over backwards to be evenhanded \u2013 let's say, for instance, by declining (I'd say \"neglecting\") to call global-warming deniers reactionary scoundrels cynically politicizing science, or by giving wide berth to religious fundamentalists. NPR News is propaganda like water is acid.</p> <p>I'll give the critics this, though. Public broadcasting does appeal to elites \u2013 you know, that cabal of the curious who shamelessly consider ideas, no matter how alien or uncomfortable.</p> <p>But since when is that suspicious behavior? Have the culture wars mutated into Cultural Revolution West, wherein <em>wondering</em> is a subversive act? So grotesquely has this notion of alien elitism metastasized that the majority of candidates for the Republican presidential nomination felt comfortable dismissing the educated class as socialist moles somehow out-of-touch with American values. (Rick Santorum: \"We will never have the elite, smart people on our side, because they believe they should have the power to tell you what to do.\") </p> <p>Once again, <em>unofficially</em>, let me offer this counter-assertion: anybody who promotes less knowledge over more, common wisdom over study, \"tradition\" over education, certainty over reflection, and superstition over science is a fool or worse. If public broadcasting is biased against anti-intellectualism, long live bias. </p> <p>Not that the consumers of public broadcasting are some rarified club of Ivy League pencil-necks. Remember, there are 170 million of us. We're not some hoity-toity minority of cultural snobs. Mitt Romney take note: we are the 55%.</p> <p>But you've heard that before, right? The society has been quarreling over this issue for decades. There remains, though, one constant theme that has not been much questioned: the idea that Americans should not be taxed for media they personally find objectionable.</p> <p>Really? Why?</p> <p>Federal programs aren't opt-in. The law is not a la carte; it's prix fixe. You get a lot of stuff you like and some stuff you don't like, but there is no tax credit for that. In a free society, more or less by definition, the laws and policies reflect a diversity of viewpoints, ideologies and solutions with the advantage to the party in power. And on 15 April, you're billed for your share of the pie.</p> <p>Oh, but you do get a choice of what your taxes pay for. It is called an \"election\". Elected governments govern. You vote them in, and they get to decide how to spend the budget. Note to the Tea Party: that isn't tyranny. </p> <p>Unofficially, it is the very essence of democracy, duh.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/05/robin-fior\" title=\"\">Robin Fior</a> was a contemporary and good friend of mine at Harrow, where he first expressed his socialist temperament and visual skills. Jewish, short-statured and short-sighted, with an aversion to team sport, he was far from being a typical Harrovian.</p> <p>His background was also atypical. Lucien, his father, was a London solicitor, and the family lived over the office in Manchester Square. Lucien had acted for Harry Willcock, whose refusal to show his identity card to a policeman led to the abolition of identity cards after a widely publicised prosecution, and young Robin was not slow to grasp the message of protest, which became his lifelong philosophy.</p> <p>His ready access in the holidays to the cultural riches of the metropolis encouraged his appetite for the visual arts and the iconography of protest. He taught himself the essentials of typography; while his contemporaries at school might gossip about county cricket, Robin would expatiate on the revolutionary virtue of sans serif typefaces. His most satisfying achievement at school was in the publication of Broadsheet, a literary magazine written and illustrated by his contemporaries, which he handsomely designed.</p> <p>However, his judgment of how his virtues would be appreciated was not always perfect, and nowhere was it worse than at Oxford, where we both arrived in 1953. He was determined to make a big social impact on the undergraduate scene. He concluded that the best route upwards lay in assiduously attending student parties, while noting that freshmen were urged to restrict their social ambitions for the first two terms until they had sat \"prelims\", the first public examinations.</p> <p>Robin devised a cunning plan, worthy of Baldrick: he decided to dispense with prelims in favour of the social whirl, and when the time came, he duly failed his exams. He was unable to work while his contemporaries, freed of the shackles of revision, drank and danced their way through the Oxford summer, and he failed his second shot at the exams. Sadly, the dons of Magdalen College did not appreciate his gifts, and his university career came to a premature end.</p>",
  "<p>How can you spot a secret cabinet dominatrix? Why, by her semantics of course. This is why Theresa May's penchant for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/03/interviews.conservatives\" title=\"\">leatherette trousers</a>, red patent heels, and violent shoulder padding has been a red herring when it comes to revealing her S&amp;M tendencies. As a former domme myself, I have always suspected her poor sartorial choices were strategic signifiers designed to detract from May's punitive policy leanings. And now, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/09/victims-antisocial-behaviour-punishment\" title=\"\">announcement of her \"menu\" of punishments</a> for victims to choose from seems to have outed her once and for all.</p> <p>Welcome to Mistress May's alternative justice system, where community contrapasso \u2013 you know, where the punishment fits the crime, just like in Dante's Inferno \u2013 is the strategy, and the forced binary of victim versus perpetrator the end game. Mistress May is all about handing power back to the victims. Think of her as the Maid Marian of social misdemeanour. She wants victims of injustice to feel as good as she does when she realises she doesn't understand <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/abu-qatada-deportation-so-close\" title=\"\">deportation deadlines</a>, but still manages to get rid of scary Muslim clerics anyway.</p> <p>So here are a few examples of the kinds of \"community remedy\" we can probably expect under the new alternative justice system.</p> <h2><strong>Graffiti: enforced scrubbing</strong></h2> <p>Mistress May doesn't like graffiti. Not how it covers arbitrary municipal buildings, not how good the paint smells compared with the scent of wee-sprinkled outer edifices, and not how it looks positively tasteful compared to some of her more garish jacket choices. Top of the punishment menu will be enforced scrubbing, whereby the victim is encouraged to blindfold the perpetrator before \"gifting\" them only da toothbrush and no soap as they clean up their community and their consciences.</p> <h2><strong>Noise pollution: sensory deprivation</strong></h2> <p>Urban oiks with poor choice in grime can look forward to being identified as the chief culprits here, especially if they like to try and disguise themselves as third runways. Recommended punishment will consist of enforced \"white noise\" sensory deprivation and aural re-education. Mistress May is big on aural re-education \u2013 remember her decision to walk off stage to Primal Scream \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/05/primal-scream-theresa-may-mistake\" title=\"\">sorry, the Dandy Warhols</a> \u2013 at last year's Tory party conference? And if it's not them on loop, it may well be the sound of Mistress May's victims reading out her new bill of rights \u2013 which will probably also be a load of white noise, considering only she has any idea what these \"rights\" are.</p> <h2><strong>Burglary: middle England's tickle torture</strong></h2> <p>So we know this is currently <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19880520\" title=\"\">Cameron's mandate</a>, but it's surely only a matter of time before Mistress May takes up the training of victims in tying, cropping and tickle torturing techniques. I mean, what better punishment than having to come body-to-body with the indignant middle-Englanders you were trying to rob? Over and over again.</p>",
  "<p>Many bisexual people are the victims of prejudice, not just from homophobic heterosexuals but also from lesbians and gay men.</p> <p>Many people's perceptions of bisexuality are drawn from media reports on the lifestyles of the rich and famous, not serious studies such as the <a href=\"http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html#bisexuality\" title=\"\">Kinsey report</a>. Pop music in particular has produced bisexual role models; in the 1970s there was David Bowie and his bisexual alter-ego, Ziggy Stardust, and when Jessie J recently announced that she was bisexual, the gay rumour mill went into overdrive, with people speculating that she was really a lesbian.</p> <p>But what is life \u2013 and work \u2013 like for the thousands of ordinary people who identify as bisexual? A recent report from Stonewall found that bisexual men and women were seven times more likely to disguise their sexual orientation in the workplace. According to the LGB campaigning group's latest <a href=\"http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_work/workplace_equality_index_2013/default.asp\" title=\"\">Workplace Equality Index</a>, while many employers have shown real progress in building the confidence of lesbian and gay employees, a lack of understanding of bisexuality seems to have resulted in bisexual people remaining largely invisible.</p> <p>Part of the challenge for employers is that while they may have established an LGBT employee network, this may not be enough to reach out and engage with bisexual employees. Stonewall's research also found that bisexual men and women often feel excluded from LGBT employee networks, as these are perceived to primarily cater for lesbians and gay men, with little participation by bisexual employees or focus on bisexual issues.</p> <p>These findings are echoed by Marcus Morgan from <a href=\"http://www.bisexualindex.org.uk\" title=\"\">The Bisexual Index</a>, who stresses that while existing employment law offers protection for bisexuals, the problem is implementation. \"Most workplace LGBT networks are primarily lesbian and gay networks,\" he says. \"Bisexual people have reported being made to feel unwelcome if they bring opposite sex partners to supposedly inclusive events.\"</p> <p>So what can bisexual men and women do to increase their visibility in the workplace? According to Morgan: \"The main way to tackle biphobia at work is to realise that most of it isn't intentional.\" He suggests the following steps: \"Research the amount of support available. Deciding to come out is an immensely personal thing and no one should feel obliged to do so. But if an LGBT employee network allows 'friends and allies' that can be a good way to encourage people of all sexualities to join in.\"</p> <p>Morgan recommends coming out at work one step at a time. \"Mentioning that you were at a Pride march over the weekend and waiting to be asked: 'but if it's Pride who were you there supporting?' can be as useful as coming straight out with 'it's Bi Visibility Day on Sunday so I'm off to BiFest'.\"</p> <p>As for employers, Morgan suggests that anyone wishing to address biphobia in the workplace begins by reading a report produced earlier this year by research group BiUK and published by the Open University. <a href=\"http://www8.open.ac.uk/ccig/files/ccig/The%20BisexualityReport%20Feb.2012.pdf\" title=\"\">Bisexual Report: Bisexual Inclusion in LGBT Equality and Diversity</a> offers an in-depth analysis of the present situation, along with useful suggestions for implementing improvements. These include: making specific reference to bisexuals in policy and decision-making, and recognising that using \"gay\" as shorthand for LGB in a sexual orientation strategy can give bisexual staff the impression that the policy or procedure isn't applicable to them.</p> <p>\"We know that people perform better at work when they can be themselves,\" says Ruth Hunt, Stonewall's director of public affairs. \"But for many bisexual people this is impossible. Employers need to learn that generic messages targeted at gay and lesbian people don't necessarily resonate with bisexuals.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.diversitycareersshow.com/\">The Diversity Careers Show</a> is taking place at the Grand Connaught Rooms in London on Friday 19 October</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A drive to end \"corrupt and unacceptable\" union activities across the public sector including curbs on time off for union duties and the right to send out union propaganda has been signalled by the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, and the former defence secretary, Liam Fox.</p> <p>At the Conservative conference in Birmingham, Pickles denounced funding of union activity by the state as a form of stealth taxation, and said he was shocked by how the Labour government had embedded subsidised union activity in the public sector.</p> <p>His move follows restrictions imposed on union activity in Whitehall by the Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, on Monday.</p> <p>Pickles told a fringe meeting hosted by the Freedom Association that he wanted local councils to charge unions to check-off union subscriptions from payrolls. He said it could be \"a nice little earner\"that might save a couple of bob to reduce the council tax.</p> <p>He added: \"I am delighted to announce today in relatively short time we will be offering advice to local authorities both in terms of trade union time and check-off. I want to retain the independence of trades unions and therefore it is massively important that they pay for things themselves.\"</p> <p>The advice will set out the maximum time union officials in local government should be given to undertake their activities.</p> <p>Pickles highlighted that he had made it a criminal offence for councillors not to declare if they union members, in receipt of union funding or unable to attend a council meeting after being given time off for union activity.</p> <p>At the same meeting, Fox said the system of paid time off for union activities was corrupt and unacceptable. He called for restrictions on union activity to be extended to local government, schools and the NHS.</p> <p>He said: \"It may well irritate voters out there that in an era of public sector cutbacks, not all of the public sector is making its fair share of cuts. In an era of austerity there are those who regard themselves as too potent to make a contribution. I refer not to the much maligned bankers or to the mansion owners that so irritate Lib Dems, but to one of the most protected groups now in our society \u2013 they are the trades unions.\"</p> <p>Promising to take action in parliament, he said it was \"an absolute disgrace\" that union officials in the Ministry of Defence received \u00a33.9m from the state. It was \"unbelievable that these officials had the right in the department to email every single person in the MoD, so my own private office and special advisers were getting emails from the unions in the MoD telling us how wicked our policies were\". He added: \"I wonder how widely this is replicated across government and how much it is costing us.\"</p> <p>He added that the allocation of time off was based on full departmental size, and not on union membership. For instance, he said, the Public and Commercial Services union claimed 55,000 members in HM Revenue &amp; Customs yet its facility time allocation was based on a departmental headcount of 75,456. \"This situation is intolerable and must be changed,\" he said.</p> <p>Fox said the arrangement was corrupt and a backdoor means of subsidising the Labour party. Unions were likely to respond to his campaign with spite, he added, but the government should show resolve in fighting back.</p>",
  "<p>In his fine obituary for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/05/robin-fior\" title=\"\">Robin Fior</a>, Richard Hollis mentions Fior's association with, and work for, the <a href=\"http://www.cnduk.org/\" title=\"\">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.committee100.org/\" title=\"\">Committee of 100</a> at the end of the 1950s and into the early 60s. The posters and leaflets that Fior designed for these two organisations, at the very start of their campaigns, were brilliant and equal to any such graphic work anywhere.</p> <p>He created the poster for the first CND demonstration, a mass lobby of parliament only three months after the campaign group's 1957 inauguration. Soon after, he designed a poster for the first Aldermaston-to-London Easter march. For both actions he used a dramatic, reverse print \u2013 white letters on a black background. (They were a pleasure to display and flypost.) As with the posters, his leaflets for these events were also fine examples of graphic design serving the message: immediate, visually striking, clear and uncluttered.</p> <p>In the early 60s, he designed a series of posters for the C100, presenting their numerous actions of mass civil disobedience in the most direct and persuasive format. These posters still communicate their message with creative design and clarity.

Yamanaka and Gurdon have shown how science can be done ethically. Yamanaka has taken people\u2019s ethical concerns seriously about embryo research and modified the trajectory of research into a path that is acceptable for all. He deserves not only a Nobel Prize for Medicine, but a Nobel Prize for Ethics.</p> <p>Before Yamanaka\u2019s breakthrough, which built on Gurdon\u2019s work, this research could only be done on cells derived from live human embryos. Many people objected to the creation of embryos for research, describing it as cannabalizing human beings. They even objected to the use of embryos no longer required for IVF. This led GW Bush to introduce laws that retarded the field for years. Yamanaka was able to overcome all those objections and resuscitate the field.</p> <p>Yamanaka has opened the door to a completely new kind of medicine: regenerative medicine. Until now, dead or damaged tissue and organs, for example in the brain or heart, have been replaced by scar tissue. This results in loss of function, such as inability to talk or walk after a stroke, or heart failure after a heart attack. Regenerative medicine offers the prospect of replacing dead or damaged human parts with new functioning ones. It also opens a radically new way of studying the origin of disease: by creating tissue with disease, it can be experimented on in the laboratory, instead of in humans and animals. This is good for humans and good for non-human animals used in experiments.</p> <p>This is as significant as the discovery of antibiotics.

In a section titled \"How not to start\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fortunately, the greater part of my career did not follow logically from its exceptionally inauspicious beginning. At my school, students were not taught biology until the age of 15. After just one semester of starting biology, my biology teacher reported at length on my efforts by saying, among other things, that \u201cI believe Gurdon has ideas about becoming a scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous; if he can't learn simple biological facts he would have no chance of doing the work of a specialist, and it would be a sheer waste of time, both on his part and of those who would have to teach him.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>From the section \"Toward mechanisms of nuclear reprogramming\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Probably the worst stage in an academic career is when starting on one's own as a new assistant professor, with a hefty load of new lectures to be prepared, the need to acquire research support for an independent program, the wish to attract students to form a group, and no one except oneself to do the lab work with which to attract students and research support.

Educated at Eton, he was on course to study classics, only to receive a surprising offer from an Oxford admissions tutor who had neglected to fill all the places at his college. Fate, if a scientist believes in such things, led the young John to follow his childhood interests and read Zoology at Christ Church.</p> <p>A PhD followed in 1962, and there again fate intervened. Challenged with working on transplanting a nucleus from one cell to another, John successfully \"cloned\" the South African frog Xenopus laevis from a tadpole's intestinal cell (\"a pivotal piece of luck,\" he says) by transplanting the nucleus into an empty Xenopus egg cell. The result was an organism genetically identical to the tadpole before. This proved that cells can be \"reprogrammed\" to start anew.</p> <p>The discovery caused shockwaves around the scientific community, not least because a mere graduate student had disproved previously held dogma developed by more famous and established scientists.</p> <p>\"In the 1950s, no one knew if all cells in the body had the same genes,\" says John. \"The hypothesis was that as cells grew they lost the genes they didn't need.\" His finding proved that cells all carry the same genes, with other factors telling the cell which to use. The biologist John Haldane dubbed John's achievement \"cloning\", borrowing a term from plant biology, and a new field was born.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:15:41.067Z\">at 4.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072a567c0e361310bc6c9ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T10:06:07.873Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video of Shinya Yamanaka</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's Yamanaka speaking when he won the 2012 millennium technology prize.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQmM8NjF6WY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AQmM8NjF6WY?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In addition, for the technically-minded, here are Yamanaka's key scientific papers on iPS stem cells:</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.cell.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867406009767\">Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors</a>\" - Cell, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/issue?pii=S0092-8674%2806%29X0698-0\">Volume 126, Issue 4</a>, 663-676, 25 August 2006</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.cell.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867407014717\">Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Adult Human Fibroblasts by Defined Factors</a>\" -&#xa0;Cell, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/issue?pii=S0092-8674%2807%29X0731-1\">Volume 131, Issue 5</a>, 861-872, 30 November 2007</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T10:51:16.860Z\">at 11.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072a2aec0e3aacd18e2f8fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T09:53:50.543Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Induced pluripotent stem cells</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/mar/13/ips-reprogrammed-stem-cells\">background on induced pluripotent (iPS) stem cells</a>, a technical tour-de-force, which was published by Yamanaka in 2007.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In 2007, Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto University in Japan demonstrated a way of producing ES-like cells without using eggs.

With the Katowice housing estates cloaked in monochrome ghetto chiaroscuro by Dawid, the film keeps its visual hip-hop signifiers tight, too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BkMDaVh3kOQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BkMDaVh3kOQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BkMDaVh3kOQ?rel=0\">Reading this on mobile?

You get the sense they were at odds with the Catholic mainstream: when Magik unveils <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq2paBCLSSc\" title=\"\">Jestem Bogiem</a> (I Am God), the blaspheming song from which the film borrows a title, his fellow group members complain he has gone \"too far\". But that's as clear as it gets. If the aim was to be the Polish <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/94082/8.mile\" title=\"\">8 Mile</a>, then it also fails to burrow deeply enough beneath Magik's petulance, and find some grandeur to give him an Eminem-like status. It's the scenes where he's borrowing money from his manager to buy nappies, not his dynamite MCing, that register.</p> <p>Shame, because where Poland tapped into hip-hop's unstoppable 90s planet-wide progress, here was a chance to make a contribution in return. A hip-hop film from a former communist country could have added edgy notes to the accepted youth-culture movie blueprint: a hunger for post-communist self-expression more urgent than the standard rebel ethic, and a scepticism about the marketing and exploitation of \"lifestyle choices\". But, doggedly concentrating on an account that is for Paktofonika insiders only, rather than laying open the subject matter for an audience outside Poland, Jeste\u015b Bogiem doesn't have that kind of awareness.</p> <p>Apparently, though, those sort of radical intentions were what the film originally had in mind. Its publicity talks it up as an indictment of new-era capitalism and compares it to Andrzej Wajda's 1976 classic <a href=\"http://www.fandor.com/films/man_of_marble\" title=\"\">Man of Marble</a> as a critique of a generation. Some PR person mastered the hallowed hip-hop tradition of self-aggrandisement there.

  "<p>I'll admit it, I'm feeling a bit nervous. Not just because I've baked a cake for Britain's toughest cake critic. But also because it's my first ever cake. It's like singing my first ever song for Simon Cowell.</p> <p>I do cook. I'm brilliant at it, as it happens. I'm just not a very cakey person, have never felt the urge to make one. But given that I'm interviewing Mr Cake himself, it would have been foolish to throw up the opportunity for feedback. I've done Grandma's apple cake \u2013 not my grandma's, my girlfriend's, Grandma Edna's.</p> <p>\"When did you make this?\" says Paul Hollywood, prodding it suspiciously. OK, I may need to work on my presentation. It's brown, crusty and cratered, like somewhere Hubble may have sent back a photo of. And it might not look its best in the plastic container I've plonked down on the table (we're in the cafe of a sort of posh indoor farmers'-market-type place in Canterbury, not far from where he lives).</p> <p>Last night, I tell him. He tries a small piece, savours expertly, ponders. I'm beginning to understand what those poor people on the television go through. \"I'm impressed,\" he says, finally. <em>He's impressed</em>! \"It's got a good bake on it, good colour, tastes great, the apples are delicious.\"</p> <p><em>Delicious</em>! Apples are notoriously tricky to bake with, he tells me. All they want to do is to release their moisture into the cake. But I've somehow (I mean, skilfully) avoided the dreaded soggy bottom. It could have done with a bit more sugar sprinkled on top. And he would suggest having it as a pudding, in winter, with a dollop of custard. \"But it does taste very, very good. I wouldn't mind the recipe.\"</p> <p><em>He wouldn't mind the recipe! Paul Hollywood off the telly wouldn't mind the recipe!</em> Well, we'll have to see what Grandma Edna has to say about that. So, do I get Star Baker? \"If I was judging this for the show as it is, I would give you \u2026 put it this way, I wouldn't be worried about you leaving,\" he says. <em>I'm not leaving!</em></p> <p>He's talking about The Great British Bake Off on BBC2, of course, more of a phenomenon than a TV show. Now in its third series, it regularly gets viewing figures of more than five million and has catapulted Hollywood from hotel baker, who has knocked on the door of television before without ever getting much more than a toe inside, to baking superstar. Not to mention national sex symbol.</p> <p>What's going on, I want to know? \"One of the reasons is because baking is more approachable [than other types of cooking] at any level,\" he says. \"So, whether you're making a pie, a pasty, a sponge cake, a cupcake, a muffin ... if you've got a set of scales, good ingredients, a good recipe, anyone \u2013 from the age of eight to 80 \u2013 can do it.\"</p> <p>Some of the credit for the show's success must go to the show itself, \"a well-oiled machine\", Paul says, which has found a nice balance between serious cookery programme and talent contest. Mel and Sue, providing jolly japes about buns and so on, are just like Ant'n'Dec for the Guardian reader. Mary Berry plays everyone's Grandma, the traditional home baker. And Paul? Well, he says that having come from a professional background (his father's bakery, followed by work in a number of top hotels), he makes a more forensic judge. Certainly he is the harsher critic, the one contestants fear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397455301\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/9/1349791194534/Paul-Hollywood---Im-actua-010.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Hollywood \u2026 'I'm actually quite a shy person.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Hollywood \u2026 'I'm actually quite a shy person.'

I'd call it fox, if he wasn't so lupine. I'm talking kitchen god, a cream filling for a housewife's dream. The shirts-and-jeans combos might not be for everyone, but there's no denying the quiet confidence, the soft but authoritative Scouse accent, the silver mane gelled to stiff peaks ...</p> <p>Yes, he's aware of that kind of attention, he says. \"It's very flattering \u2013 any bloke who says it's not is lying \u2013 if not a little bit embarrassing as well. I'm actually quite a shy person.\" Shy! Doesn't that just make you want to eat him up even more, ladies?</p> <p>Not just ladies. Paul has a big following in gay bear culture. \"Yeah, I had heard about that,\" he says. And? \"What? About the gay side? I don't have a problem with that, it's flattering, you know ...\" He doesn't seem totally comfortable talking about it, though, changes the subject, mentions his wife a lot (she's a great cook, she cooks, he bakes, he wooed her with a croissant).</p> <p>Does he think it's attractive in a man, to bake well? \"Yeah, cooking, baking, if you can make something ...\" He admits there's something sensual about it too. \"Yeah, I think so. It's all in your fingertips. You've got to know when it's right and ready to go in the oven, when to take it out; it's all very tactile.\"</p> <p>He says bakers make good masseurs too, from all that practice manipulating dough. He does Sue's neck and shoulders a lot on the show; she gets a bit tense. Go on then, I say, turning to present him with my back, if you wouldn't mind? \"No!\" Just a little one? \"No!\" That's because you're worried about your gay-bear following. \"It's because I know people in here.\" He does; several have come over to say hello while we've been here, but I don't see how it rules out a little knead.</p> <p>Oh well. Instead we talk about baking. About what makes a great baker (passion); about his passions outside baking (cars, especially Aston Martins \u2013 he owns a DB9); about how well he gets on with Mary (very, he stays with her when he's in London); about whether they agree (usually, but not always; they once nearly fell out over a chocolate fondant); about whether he always knows who's going to win (usually by show five, but not in this series).</p> <p>And we talk about the contents of his breadbin at home. There's half a baguette, a seeded brown, a ciabatta, all made by him, of course. Then there's a Warburton's medium sliced white ... whoa, what? Paul Hollywood, artisan baker, author of 101 Great Breads, whose almond and roquefort and sourdough bread goes for \u00a315 a loaf in Harrods, has sliced white at home? Not just at home, in his son's lunchbox sometimes. Why? \"It's a great carrier,\" he says. \"Don't kid yourself. Every five-star hotel I've worked at buys in sliced white, for sandwiches.\"</p> <p>He's tried them all \u2013 Hovis, Kingsmill (which used to be advertised by Mel and Sue, remember?), but Warburtons is the best. It has to be medium-sliced, and in the waxed packet, not the plastic bag. He's not sponsored by Warburtons, is he? \"I might be after this,\" he chuckles.</p> <p>Well, I may not have got a massage from Paul Hollywood, but at least I got his dirty little secret out of him.</p> <p>\u2022 The final of The Great British Bake Off is on Tuesday 16 October at 8pm on BBC2.

  "<p>Having now digested much of yesterday's calm and measured punditry on the state of the race for the White House, I wanted to offer my take \u2013 my \"read\", if you will \u2013 on that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/romney-gains-lead-obama-poll\">earth-shaking Pew poll</a>, which gives Mitt Romney a four-point lead among likely voters. I concede that others may disagree, but from where I'm standing, this looks like bad news for Barack Obama. Really bad news. If the poll had given the president, say, a 25-point lead, that would have been good news for Democrats. But this is different: it's bad news. </p> <p>If there's one thing I've learned in my years as a leading member of Washington's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Note_%28ABC_News%29\">\"Gang of 500\" opinion-shapers</a>, it's this: going into a two-horse race for the presidency, you don't want to be the guy with less support than the other guy. It's just not a feasible election strategy. Which is why I feel no hesitation in delivering the following warning to Team Chicago. If Obama wants to win on November 6, there's only one remaining path to victory: he must \u2013 absolutely <em>must</em> \u2013 win a majority of the votes in the electoral college.</p> <p>To get a bit wonkish for a moment, the really troubling metric in that Pew survey&#xa0;\u2013 once you drill down beneath the headlines to the raw data-point fundamentals \u2013 is popularity. If Obama can't find a way to clinch more popularity, his other ratings won't much matter. With the arguable exception of the (deeply anomalous) election of 1802, no candidate has ever won the presidency by losing it. The Democrats can't retain control of the White House by relying on Republican votes. The math just isn't there. </p> <p>So it's time for Axlerod, Plouffe et. al. to get real: the narrative is shifting from a horse-race narrative to a narrative about the dominant narrative, in which Obama is no longer gets to define the narrative. Or, perhaps just as importantly, the optics. (BuzzFeed has a must-read deep-dive long-read on this; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">read the whole thing</a>.) Thursday's debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan will be crucial: the consensus in DC circles is that it'll probably be the only chance for the vice-presidential candidates to meet in a televised head-to-head clash. As one Romney insider revealed to me the other day, the debate is <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/small-college-town-in-central-kentucky-seeks-a-bounce-from-playing-host-to-vp-debate-thursday/2012/10/09/318d1cee-11f5-11e2-9a39-1f5a7f6fe945_story.html\">being held in Kentucky</a>. And if Biden wants to win, he simply doesn't have the luxury of ignoring that fact. He has to go to Kentucky. </p> <p>Memo to Barack Obama: stop reading <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77595.html\">articles in Politico</a> with headlines like \"Memo to Barack Obama\" and focus. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/does-barack-obama-really-want-to-lose\">Several</a> of my <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/2012/10/08/does_obama_even_want_to_win_292291.html\">colleagues</a> are now <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/liberals-fret-is-obama-bored-does-he-even-want-a-second-term/article/2510054#.UHQcLRgtsyw\">openly</a> beginning to wonder whether the president really wants to win. Deep down, they argue, he's lost heart; at the innermost level of his personality, behind the public facade, his faith in the possibility of real change has started to crumble. Their evidence for this psychoanalytic reading is certainly persuasive: all of them watched last week's debate, and some also spent several hours on Twitter. But I'm not ready to agree yet. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong: I'm not disputing Andrew Sullivan's judgment, in a post over at the Daily Dish, that yesterday's poll was <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/did-obama-just-throw-the-entire-election-away.html\">the worst thing that has ever happened</a>. But I still think the president can win this thing. He just needs to get enough votes.</p> <p>And can he? </p> <p>Well, put it this way: this election isn't over yet.</p>",
  "<p>Michael O'Higgins, who was chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Audit Commission</a> until last week, contemplates its long, slow and painful demise. \"I think we anticipated that given the fiscal consolidation, if anything there would be a bigger role for a body that focused on value for money and providing comparative examples of&#xa0;how you could do things better,\" he says. But clearly not.</p> <p>The abolition of the commission was one of the coalition government's <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1688111\" title=\"\">early bombshells</a>. It was announced, out of the blue, during the August recess immediately after the election by the communities secretary, Eric Pickles.</p> <p>Two years on, the debris from a decision that appeared to many outside observers to have been taken in a fit of&#xa0;pique has still to be cleared away. There is still only a draft bill that won't become law until 2014 to actually abolish the commission, which was set up almost 30 years ago by the Tory secretary of state Michael Heseltine to improve the \"economy, efficiency and effectiveness\" of local government, and to guarantee independent audit of local authorities. Assorted bits and pieces of the commission's work \u2013 the National Fraud Initiative and its code of conduct for public sector audit, for example \u2013 have still to be found a home.</p> <p><strong>Independence</strong></p> <p>While Irishman O'Higgins, 58, an economist, academic and management consultant, is determined not to appear bitter about the demise of the commission, he says he still has real concerns about the outcome. Not least \"whether or not the independence of audit will be properly guaranteed\".</p> <p>Unlike the coalition government, he&#xa0;remains convinced there is still a role&#xa0;for&#xa0;independent analysis of the performance of local authorities and other public services such as the NHS \u2013&#xa0;as a tool for improvement. \"I guess I believe that analysis can help you do things better. And therefore you will improve frontline services more by doing a bit more analysis. But that is a&#xa0;judgment call that&#xa0;different people make differently,\" he says.</p> <p>Well before the general election in&#xa0;May 2010, the Conservatives had made clear they were going to scrap the&#xa0;jewel in the Audit Commission's crown \u2013 the year-old comprehensive area assessment (CAA), the commission's table of&#xa0;the comparative performance not just of local government but of&#xa0;all public services across areas of England. It was hoped that the one-stop website would allow councillors, the public and a wide range of officials and managers to compare how well they were doing and how well their services were working together. Compare, contrast and learn.</p> <p>To Pickles and many other Conservatives \u2013 not to mention many Liberal Democrats in local government \u2013 the CAA represented the worst excesses of what they saw as Labour's target-driven, tick-box, centrally dictated approach to public service reform. There were bitter complaints about the burden and the cost of the exercise.</p> <p>But no one expected the entire Audit Commission to go, along with its value-for-money studies on local authorities and the NHS, and its role of independently appointing auditors to councils, primary care trusts and the hospitals that are not yet foundation trusts.</p> <p>Between May and August 2010, there was a bitter public row about the pay for&#xa0;a new chief executive. Ministers were insisting officials should not be paid more than the prime minister's \u00a3142,000. O'Higgins \u2013 who had a candidate prepared to be paid less than his predecessor and less than he currently earned \u2013 attempted to insist on something over \u00a3200,000.</p> <p>The row \"doubtless didn't help\", he says, and he concedes he could have handled it differently. \"As to whether or not that was the tipping point\" and the commission was abolished in exasperation over its stance, \"only time will reveal\", he says.</p> <p>The first O'Higgins knew of the commission being abolished was when he was told that the secretary of state would call \u2013 but officials would not disclose the&#xa0;subject matter. \"That is quite unusual. Normally, one gets an indication of&#xa0;what it is about,\" he explains. Has Pickles ever explained to him in detail why he decided to scrap the entire organisation? \"I haven't had a conversation with the secretary of state since that telephone conversation,\" O'Higgins says. Has he tried to initiate one? \"No. I&#xa0;think once the decision had been made \u2013 and so loudly made \u2013 there was never going to be any going back. And we saw&#xa0;no point in a prolonged attempt at survival.\"</p> <p>A key part of Pickles's announcement was that councils would in future be allowed to appoint their own auditors. One of the Audit Commission's duties was to issue \"public interest reports\" where there is serious financial mismanagement or underperformance. Scores have been issued over the years, many small, but some large, such as the one into Doncaster where the government in&#xa0;2010 finally appointed a new chief executive and advisory board to the dysfunctional local authority.</p> <p>Auditors have been able to issue such reports because they couldn't be fired. The commission appointed them and stood behind them. In future, however, auditors will face pressure over losing contracts, or not even getting them in the first place if they develop a reputation for issuing such reports, O'Higgins fears. It is interesting, he notes, that no public interest reports have been issued on NHS foundation trusts, which are allowed to appoint their own auditors despite some performance and financial scandals. \"That may not be a coincidence,\" he says.</p> <p>And while councils will not now get&#xa0;the opportunity to appoint their own&#xa0;auditors until 2017 at the earliest, \"the unanswered question remains of&#xa0;what happens if there is another Doncaster? What form of intervention takes place?\"</p> <p><strong>Scrutiny</strong></p> <p>Equally, the scrutiny provided by the commission's value-for-money studies will go at a time when public service spending is being heavily cut. The National Audit Office may pick up a few&#xa0;local government studies a year. Thinktanks and universities may help plug the hole, \"but they will need to find funding\", says O'Higgins. And the Local Government Association may find it difficult to do comparative studies that show some of their members in a poor light, he points out.</p> <p>The government's favoured \"armchair auditors\" may make use of the mass of extra information to be published on public bodies' performance. But \"analytic effort\" is still needed to turn \"so-called facts into information\", O'Higgins says.</p> <p>He concedes, however, there is a case to be made that in straitened times cash should be spent on the extra nurse or social worker rather than management analysis.</p> <p>O'Higgins may have ended his six years as chair of the Audit Commission amid strained relations with his sponsoring minister, but his standing is such that he was recruited to be chair of <a href=\"http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">the Pensions Regulator</a> after the row over the commission broke, and, among other things, remain on the board of the Treasury and chairman of its audit group.</p> <p>His own view of the government's attitude to independent auditing, he says, is that \"inevitably, pendulums swing, from 'We need more regulation' to 'We don't want the burden of inspection and analysis'\u2026 I have no doubt that&#xa0;the pendulum will move again in due course.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 58.</p> <p><strong>Lives</strong> East London.</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Oatlands College, Dublin; Trinity College Dublin, BA economics; London School of Economics, MSc social policy.</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Feb 2011-present: chairman, Investec Structured Products Calculus VCT plc; Jan 2011-present: chairman, the Pensions Regulator; 2009-10: chairman, Alexander Mann Solutions; Oct 2006-September 2012: chairman, Audit Commission; Jan 1997-Sept 2006: managing partner, PA Consulting Group; 1989-96: partner, Price Waterhouse Consulting; 1987-88: principal administrator, Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; 1978-87: reader, University of Bath.</p> <p><strong>Public life </strong>Non-executive director and chair of audit committee, HM Treasury.</p> <p><strong>Interest</strong> Cricket, rugby, football, cooking, wine, jazz and classical music.</p>",
  "<p>Iraq could become the world's second-largest oil exporter within two decades and double its output by 2020, a major study has found.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/iraq/\" title=\"\">International Energy Agency said Iraq</a> can overtake Russia for exports and be responsible for nearly half of all anticipated growth in global output.</p> <p>But the country's government must overcome internal disputes over oil rights with the autonomous Kurdish region in the north and increase current investment from $9bn (\u00a35.6bn) in 2011 to $25bn a year on average for the rest of the decade, the authors warned.</p> <p>The IEA's chief economist, Fatih Birol, explained: \"Developments in Iraq's energy sector are critical for the country's prospects and also for the health of the global economy.</p> <p>\"But success is not assured, and failure to achieve the anticipated increase in Iraq's oil supply would put global oil markets on course for troubled waters.\"</p> <p>Executive director, Maria van der Hoeven, added: \"We all have an interest in Iraq realising its potential and revitalising its economy.\"</p> <p>Decades of conflict have left Iraq's oil and energy sector in disarray, but Baghdad has recently signed a series of contracts with BP and Royal Dutch Shell, among others, to raise production levels.</p> <p>This year output passed 3m barrels per day (bpd) for the first time in 30 years and the country, which has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves, overtook Iran to become the second biggest producer in the Opec cartel.</p> <p>The report said Iraq can hit 6.1m bpd by 2020 and 8.3m bpd in 2035 mainly in and around Basra in the south.</p> <p>However, an ongoing dispute with the Kurdistan regional government could slow progress. The federal government says deals which the Kurds have signed with ExxonMobil and Chevron are illegal.</p> <p>A new law on hydrocarbons and revenue sharing is currently being debated but failure would cause delays.</p> <p>The report said: \"Iraq stands to gain almost $5tn (\u00a33tn) in revenues from oil export over the period to 2035, an annual average of $200bn and an opportunity to transform the country's future prospects. Achieving the required level of oil production and export will require rapid, co-ordinated progress all along the energy supply chain.\"</p> <p>One beneficiary of the surge in oil flows from Iraq, the IEA said, will be China. The agency forecast that by 2020, 80% of Iraq's oil will go to Asia.</p> <p>The report also focused on Iraq's internal energy needs and revealed that it needs 70% more power generation capacity to meet current demands and avoid rolling blackouts which continue to affect the country.</p> <p>If planned new capacity is delivered on time, however, the electricity grid will meet supply demands by 2015.</p> <p>The report added: \"Iraq needs to install around 70 gigawatts of generation capacity and move away from a predominantly oil-fired power mix to more reliance on efficient gas fired generation: without this transition Iraq would forego around $520bn in oil export revenues.\"</p>",

Until the courts give sentences that fit the crime, men like Justin Lee Collins will get away with campaigns of terror and thousands of women, like Anna, will continue to be at risk.\"</p> <p>St Albans crown court had been told that Collins, 38, from Kew, south-west London, subjected Larke, also 38, to a \"campaign of abuse\" throughout their seven-month relationship.</p> <p>Larke alleged Collins compelled her to write down in a notebook all her previous sexual encounters in graphic detail. She said he forced her to quit social networking websites, always sleep facing him and throw away DVDs because they featured actors she found attractive.</p> <p>She claimed Collins attacked her while on trips to Miami and New York and said she had not shown anyone her bruises because she did not want to get \"the love of my life\" into trouble.</p> <p>The court was played a secret recording Larke made during a row shortly before the couple split in July last year. Collins told Larke: \"You bring the fucking demon out in me\" and called her a \"fucking slag\". He also allegedly told her she had had sex with \"blacks\" and \"chinks\".</p> <p>Denying the allegations, Collins claimed the relationship with Larke was \"absolute hell\". But he said he had never hit anyone in his life. He said the secretly recorded row was completely out of character and denied being a racist.</p> <p>Judge John Plumstead sentenced Collins to carry out 140 hours unpaid work within the next 18 months and ordered him to pay \u00a33,500 in prosecution costs.</p> <p>The judge told Collins the \"humbling\" manual work he would have to do should make him pause and think about what he had done.</p> <p>Describing the crime as a \"very serious matter\", the judge said: \"Any violence in any relationship when people should be able to rely on each other is a serious breach of trust.\"</p> <p>Larke and her family said in a statement they were pleased with the verdict. \"We will not rest on our laurels in the wake of this good news and intend to go out into the world and use this experience to empower women to stand up to domestic abuse.</p> <p>\"We will also be campaigning to have emotional abuse properly recognised in law and do our utmost to end the much reported culture of celebrities using their positions to abuse people without fear of reprisal.\"</p> <p>Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins, of Hertfordshire police, said: \"I hope the outcome serves as a warning to anyone who thinks it's OK to treat another person in this manner.\"</p> <p>Vivienne Hayes, chief executive of the Women's Resource Centre, described the sentence as \"light\". She said: \"The problem is that it sends out a message to both men and women that domestic violence is not that serious, nor damaging, when in reality we know its impacts are devastating to individuals, to families and to society\".</p> <p>The definition of domestic violence has recently been widened to include emotional and psychological abuse. Hayes said the Collins case offered a \"powerful opportunity to send the message that domestic violence, in all its forms, will not be tolerated. That potential to benchmark for subsequent cases may have been lost.\"</p> <p>Deborah McIlveen, from <a href=\"http://www.womensaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Women's Aid</a>, said high profile cases like this helped raise awareness of domestic violence. She said: \"Perpetrators of domestic violence can be popular and influential people, who to the outward world seems friendly and charming, which can mean that victims don't want to come forward, as they are worried that they won't be believed.\"</p> <p>Bristol-born Collins, who rose to fame as a host on Channel 4's The Friday Night Project, did not react as the jury found him guilty of harassment causing fear of violence, an offence originally brought in to combat the threat of stalkers. Collins drove away from the court without commenting. A spokesman said: \"Justin is extremely disappointed by the verdict. He will consider his position with his lawyers.\" He had been due to appear in a charity show at the Albert Hall next month but has pulled out.</p> <p>The television presenter and comedian Justin Lee Collins has been found guilty of harassing his former partner, Anna Larke, by a jury at St Albans crown court.</p> <p>Collins, who made a name for himself as a host on Channel 4's The Friday Night Project, was ordered to do 140 hours community service. He showed no emotion as the majority verdict was returned.</p> <p>Larke, a public relations worker, claimed during the trial that Collins subjected her to emotional abuse and actual violence.</p> <p>She alleged Collins, 38, compelled her to write down in a Pukka pad all her previous sexual encounters in graphic detail.</p> <p>Larke, also 38, said Collins forced her to quit social networking websites, sleep facing him and throw away DVDs because they featured actors she found attractive.</p> <p>She alleged Collins physically attacked her while on trips to Miami and New York and said she had not shown anyone her bruises because she did not want to get \"the love of my life\" into trouble.</p> <p>The court was played a secret recording Larke made during a row shortly before the couple split in July last year. Collins apparently told Larke: \"You bring the fucking demon out in me\" and called her a \"fucking slag\". He also allegedly told her she had had sex with \"blacks\" and \"chinks\".</p> <p>In his closing statement, Peter Shaw, prosecuting, claimed the Pukka pad list was used by Collins as a \"rock\" to dash Larke's self-esteem.</p> <p>He told the jury Larke was an alcoholic, bankrupt and suffering from depression. But he insisted she was not a fantasist.</p> <p>The couple met in 2006 when Collins was hosting an awards ceremony. They began an affair while Collins was married the following year but split up in 2008. They got back together after Collins's marriage broke down in 2010.</p> <p>Denying the charge, Collins claimed Larke was obsessive, jealous and possessive and would send him a \"barrage\" of text messages wanting to know where he was and who he was with.</p> <p>He said the seven-month relationship with Larke was \"absolute hell\". \"I thought she loved me and was crazy about me,\" he said. \"But it turned out only the second part was true.\"</p> <p>Collins denied attacking her in any way, saying he had never hit anyone in his life. He told the court he had only ever slapped Larke to calm her down when she was self-harming, which he claimed she did, once gouging her wrists and threatening to commit suicide.</p> <p>He said the secretly recorded row was completely out of character and it sounded \"like someone else\". He said he was in \"meltdown\" after his relationship with Larke hit rock bottom.</p> <p>Collins said Larke dictated the details of her sex life to him of her own free will as a form of catharsis.</p> <p>He denied being a racist. He said the recording showed him at his \"absolute worst\" and if he was racist his language would have been \"far more colourful\".</p> <p>Among those who gave character references for Collins was his former wife Karen, who told the trial they arewere still friends and he was a \"lovely, genuine person\" who was never violent to her. She said he was a \"lovely dad\" to their sons Archie, seven, and Harvey, four. Asked to describe him, she said: \"Gentle, not aggressive, kind and generous\", adding that he had never tried to control her.</p> <p>The journalist Boyd Hilton, who ghost-wrote Collins's autobiography, said he was \"incredibly friendly, funny and down to earth\".</p> <p>Add for Lee Collins: Larke and her family issued a statement in which they said they were pleased with the verdict and would campaign to have emotional abuse \"properly\" recognised in the courts.</p> <p>The statement read: \"We are absolutely ecstatic with the verdict and are relieved the jury were able to see through the lies of an abuser.</p> <p>\"We will not rest on our laurels in the wake of this good news and intend to go out into the world and use this experience to empower women to stand up to domestic abuse.</p> <p>\"We will also be campaigning to have emotional abuse properly recognised in law and do our utmost to end the much reported culture of celebrities using their positions to abuse people without fear of reprisal.</p> <p>\"We thank the police and Crown Prosecution Service for their brilliance throughout and to the general public for their unwavering support and belief.</p> <p>\"We are overwhelmed by the messages from people, inspired by Anna's experience, who have left their abusive relationship. We hope this experience will empower other to do the same.\"</p> <p>Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins of Hertfordshire police said: \"No one should endure this sort of behaviour from anyone least of all someone with whom they have an intimate relationship. My team has worked really hard to bring this case before a jury and I hope the outcome serves as a warning to anyone who thinks it's OK to treat another person in this manner.</p> <p>\"The victim was extremely brave in coming forward. I would urge anyone who is or has been in a similar situation to get in contact with the police as soon as possible. I can reassure you that you will be taken seriously and treated with sensitivity.\"</p>",

  "<p>The equation is simple. Companies that treat employees well are more productive and profitable than equivalents that don't. In fact, commitment and engagement are the nearest thing to a silver bullet in the whole of management's notoriously treacherous terrain. So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-workers-rights-shares\" title=\"\">George Osborne's shares-for-rights wheeze</a> \u2013 under which in return for shares worth anything from \u00a32,000 to \u00a350,000 employees will surrender rights on unfair dismissal, redundancy, flexible working, time off for training and maternity \u2013 simply doesn't add up.</p> <p>Few people would seriously quarrel with the proposal to make it easier to make employees part owners (although trade unions \u2013 and lawyers \u2013 caution against ending up with too many eggs in one basket). But if the aim is to increase engagement, the two halves of the proposal cancel each other out. \"I welcome anything which makes it cheaper and simpler to give employees shares,\" says Henry Stewart, founder and chief executive of training company Happy, a regular winner of best workplace awards. \"But coupling it with taking away employment rights is ridiculous. If as an employer you have a problem with unfair dismissals, you need to improve management \u2013 that's what the government should be giving incentives for. I don't think it's been thought through.\"</p> <p>In effect, Osborne's cobbled-together scheme is a back-door re-run of the agenda of Adam Beecroft, the venture capitalist whose fire-at-will proposals were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/14/unfair-dismissal-compensation-cap-cut1?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">given short shrift by Vince Cable</a> (and many employers) earlier this year. His report was widely rubbished at the time for lack of supporting evidence, and the addition of Osborne's sweeteners (or nudges, perhaps?) doesn't make the underlying ideas any less wrong-headed.</p> <p>For a start, the notion that UK workers need less protection is simply wrong. The UK is already near the bottom of the OECD's employment protection league. UK employees work longer hours, are more likely to work part time and get proportionally half the employment benefits of the average. In any case, there is nothing in the OECD figures to show a correlation between low employment protection and high economic performance. Rather, the reverse: greater protection seems to go with better economic performance.</p> <p>And it's not hard to see why. If employees are feeling helpless and worried about their jobs, that is what they are likely to concentrate on rather than customers or quality. Fear makes people stupid. It also destroys trust, which is a key component of any good workplace. In Japan, notes Cardiff Business School's Prof Rick Delbridge, companies are doing their best to protect employment and strengthen employee relations rather than simply let the market rip. \"In essence this is asking employees to share the risks, but will they be getting their fair share of the rewards? Engineering shared interests is one thing, but exposing employees to such fragile employment conditions is highly questionable as a policy,\" he says.</p> <p>Others see it as a political stunt to cheer up the Tory right. \"It presses all the right buttons: deregulation, employee ownership, reducing taxes,\" says Mike Emmott, employment relations adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. \"But it rests on a fundamental misapprehension of what works. It isn't share ownership but the way people are managed that's critical. How on earth did it get past Vince Cable?\"</p> <p>Shares-for-rights harks nostalgically back to a low-trust, low-wage, low-engagement workplace that is incompatible with a knowledge economy. Fortunately, once the implications have sunk in, Emmott expects take-up for such a gimcrack scheme to be low among both employees and firms that take management seriously \u2013 a joke rather than a serious danger.</p>",
  "<p>A 14-year old Pakistani activist who championed education for girls has been shot in the head by a Taliban gunman.</p> <p>The attack on Malala Yousafzai, who became famous for highlighting Taliban atrocities, happened as she sat in a bus preparing to leave the school grounds in Mingora, the main city in the Swat valley which was the scene of intense fighting between the army and the Taliban in 2009.</p> <p>At least one other girl was also hurt in the attack on Tuesday that a Taliban spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, quickly claimed the group was responsible for.</p> <p>He said the teenager's work had been an \"obscenity\" that needed to be stopped: \"This was a new chapter of obscenity, and we have to finish this chapter.\"</p> <p>Doctors said the gunshot wounds to her head and neck were serious and that she might have to be moved to a larger hospital in Islamabad or Peshawar.</p> <p>Fazal Maula Zahid, a member of Swat Qaumi Jirga, a local anti-Taliban group working for peace in the valley, said the gunman had asked which of the girls was Malala.</p> <p>One of the girls pointed to Malala, but the activist denied it was her. The gunman shot both of the girls.</p> <p>\"An attack on Malala in a highly secured area has sent a shiver down the spine of Swati people,\" Zahid said.</p> <p>\"It has also created doubts about the claims of the authorities that militants have been flushed out from Swat.\"</p> <p>Malala won fame in 2009 during the Pakistani army operations to crush a Taliban insurgency that had taken hold in the Swat valley, an area popular among Pakistani tourists three hours drive from Islamabad.</p> <p>As part of her campaign for girls' education <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7834402.stm\" title=\"\">she wrote an anonymous blog for the BBC</a> about the chaos at the time, including the burning of girls' schools.</p> <p>Her efforts were recognised by Pakistan's prime minister who awarded her the country's first National Peace award and a reward of around \u00a33,300 after she missed out on winning the International Children's Peace Prize for which she was nominated in 2011.</p> <p>She had also spoken of her desire to set up her own political party and a vocational institute for marginalised girls in her area.</p> <p>But all the publicity displeased the Pakistani Taliban, which had put her and her family on its \"hit list\" for backing \"the imposition of secular\" government in Swat.</p> <p>The attack in the army-dominated Mingora has led some to question government claims that the military has dismantled the militants' operation in Swat.</p> <p>\"We are holding urgent meeting of our Jirga to chalk out a future strategy,\" said Zahid. \"We demand of the government to arrest the attackers [otherwise] the confidence of the people in the government will greatly be shaken.\"</p> <p>Zahid Khan, another Quami Jirga activist who was attacked earlier in the year, said the authorities were not doing enough.</p> <p>\"More than 20 people have been killed in militant attacks after the army finished its operations but all the army does is protect itself and government buildings,\" he said. \"It seems that innocent civilians are once again are at the mercy of miscreants.\"</p> <p>Also on Tuesday a case before the supreme court highlighted other problems faced by women when justices ordered an investigation into the alleged barter of seven girls to settle a blood feud in a remote district in south west Pakistan.</p> <p>Chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry began proceedings into the allegations, which were first reported in the local media. The alleged trade happened in the Dera Bugti district of Baluchistan province between two groups within the Bugti tribe.</p> <p>A tribal council ordered the barter in early September, the district deputy commissioner, Saeed Faisal, told the court. He did not know the girls' ages but local media reported they were between four and 13.</p> <p>Chaudhry ordered Faisal to make sure that all members of the tribal council appear in court on Wednesday, as well as a local lawmaker who belongs to one of the two subtribes believed involved in the incident.</p> <p>The tradition of families exchanging unmarried girls to settle feuds is banned under Pakistani law but still practiced in the country's more conservative, tribal areas.</p>",
  "<p>The pay freeze imposed on NHS staff should continue for at least another year, says the chief executive of the NHS Confederation.</p> <p>Speaking at a Guardian healthcare network fringe event at the Conservative party conference, Mike Farrar said that negotiations should focus on \"pay restraint\".</p> <p>\"We spend 65p in every \u00a31 on staff, we need to think about a settlement with staff around pay restraint for another short period of time in order for us to have the wherewithal to restructure the business,\" Farrar said. \"We have to have a proper settlement and a proper debate about this, but some degree of pay restraint and a fair approach to pay for the next two or three years is going to be vital to allow us the headroom to change the service.\"</p> <p>Farrar also highlighted the need for the health service to rethink its relationship with the public, telling delegates: \"The politics of health mask the importance of connecting to the public. We need a new deal with the public on what they expect from healthcare and how we can deliver that.\"</p> <p>He added that it will become increasingly important to communicate the true cost of services to people in terms that they can understand in order to create a \"care footprint\".</p> <p>Farrar told the debate, about new partnerships in healthcare, that the health service was very \"commercially naive\" and must evolve to understand the value of working with small and medium-sized businesses.</p> <p>He added that the NHS \"doesn't go out of its way to understand the business models that create the wins, we deal in monopoly money and we have very little understanding of what it takes for a small or medium enterprise trying to develop a product that could help us improve out outcomes. We have got to be much better in terms of understanding the commercial risks and the commercial benefits of working with the NHS.\"</p> <p>Farrah was joined on the panel by Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of event sponsor ABPI, who stressed the importance of strong partnerships based on a balance of risk and reward. He told delegates that the pharmaceutical industry had enabled the NHS to survive, by evolving care systems and developing drugs to keep costs down.</p> <p>He said: \"Without the discoveries and developments this industry has brought to the table, the NHS could not survive. Without what we've done, the system couldn't do anything more than sweat a fevered brow.\"</p> <p>Whitehead also told delegates that profit should not be considered an \"evil word\" and that more should be done to encourage NHS staff and the public to work closely with the pharmaceutical industry, through <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/06/ahcn/\" title=\"\">Academic Health Science Networks</a>, in order to integrate research and trials into the healthcare system.</p> <p>The debate also heard contributions from Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of GPs, and Nick Seddon, deputy director at thinktank Reform. Gerada agreed with Farrar on the need for a sensible and frank discussion with staff over pay and what the NHS can afford. However, she warned against constantly striving for innovation without looking back on the history of the sector, telling the audience that \"those who go looking for new solutions and innovation never go looking in their own back yard\".</p> <p>Gerada highlighted the importance of learning lessons from long-standing organisations, a point which was echoed by Seddon when he spoke about the need for longer contracts with the private sector in order to let services grow and evolve naturally over time.</p> <p>Seddon expressed his concern over the clarity of plans to change the configuration of the NHS. He also spoke out about the need to give managers more power to fire staff who perform poorly, and reward and incentivise others. Seddon cited the example of Hinchingbrooke hospital, operated by Circle, and claimed that the company was frustrated by its inability to control the hiring and firing of staff within current national frameworks, something which is holding the hospital back.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

It's dark in a wafting around a country house on New Year's Eve kind of way, rather than <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440345/\" title=\"\">Sean Penn</a> as Robert Smith in This Must Be the Place or scowling black-clad sixth-former.</p> <p>And naysayers to Gucci's dark romance can check out other variations. <a href=\"http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/F2012RTW-PUGH\" title=\"\">Gareth Pugh's</a> monochrome, architectural collection had a futuristic slant, which he described as \"savage, raw, and untamed\". The ultimate endorsement of the dark side comes from <a href=\"http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/F2012RTW-ERDEM\" title=\"\">Erdem</a> \u2013 usually a purveyor of deliciously light, feminine frocks loved by Samantha Cameron, this autumn he added deep purple to his colour palette and fused his signature lace with black latex on shift dresses. The result was a pretty goth look. \"My work has been about a kind of femininity even if the aesthetic is darker,\" he says. \"Fall was much more about a woman as opposed to a girl. I was attracted to a certain type of toughness.\"</p> <p>Off the catwalk, a gothic mood is blowing in \u2013 and has just as many guises. For a streety take, celtic crosses have been spotted on <a href=\"http://fashiondip.com/trends/the-inverted-cross-trend\" title=\"\">Rihanna</a> and rising star Delilah, while <a href=\"http://theblackbelles.com/\" title=\"\">the Black Belles</a>, signed to Jack White's Third Man Records, come complete with black lipstick.

While October's Vogue features makeup artist <a href=\"http://www.illamasqua.com/explore/about-us/the-art-team/\" title=\"\">Alex Box</a> on teenage adventures in \"Hammer House heroine\" style, <a href=\"http://www.harpersbazaar.co.uk/latest-news/keira-knightley-september-cover-310712\" title=\"\">Keira Knightley</a> was on the cover of Harper's Bazaar for September, hair wild, pout painted in a delicious shade of blackcurrant. This cover alone demonstrates that this is a trend backed by the big hitters. \"The September issue is the most important of the year and we want to represent the season with the cover,\" says Kay Barron, fashion features editor. \"Goth is one of the biggest trends of the season, but it's not Camden Town goth, it's romantic.\"</p> <p>If <a href=\"http://siouxsie.firebrandstore.com/\" title=\"\">Siouxsie Sioux</a> and <a href=\"http://www.evilbeetgossip.com/2012/09/25/winona-ryder-just-sh-t-all-over-your-beetlejuice-2-hopes-and-dreams/\" title=\"\">Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice</a> were icons for 80s goths, Barron points to Rooney Mara as a reference point \u2013 \"but her on the red carpet, not in Dragon Tattoo\". <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kristen-stewart-goes-goth-for-interview-854001\" title=\"\">Kristen Stewart</a> and <a href=\"http://gossilicious.com/?tag=evan-rachel-wood\" title=\"\">Evan Rachel Wood</a> could also work. Slick but still slightly sinister compared with, say, Emma Stone, they appeal to a customer who has devoured Twilight and True Blood. \"She's grown up with goth culture so it's not as radical as it was to people a bit older,\" says Judd Crane, director of womenswear at Selfridges. \"A full leather outfit won't be scary.\" Topshop's design director Jacqui Markham agrees. For the store's Sensationalist trend this season, they have merged goth and rock for a perfectly marketable mix. \"For a whole new generation, goth is about being noticed,\" she says. \"It's a sharp, fierce body-conscious look.\"</p> <p>It's almost enough to tempt the uninitiated such as myself. In my misspent youth, I experimented with many a street style \u2013 dyeing my hair green in a punky phase, and wearing Fred Perry polo shirts to channel a latterday mod. Yet goth fashion always seemed too much of a commitment. \"It takes a bit of getting used to, wearing this look,\" admits Amy Townsend, of the <a href=\"http://ultimategothguide.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stripy Tights and Dark Delights' </a>goth fashion blog. \"Everyone has an opinion when you walk down the street.\" Perhaps, with goth at its softest interpretation this season, now was the time to dip a toe in the dark side?</p> <p>My goth-over comes courtesy of <a href=\"http://bleachlondon.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bleach</a>, the hair salon in east London known for its love of subcultures. Identical-twin dream team of makeup artist Danielle Kahlani and hairdresser Nicole Kahlani \u2013 both, for extra confusion, sporting dark locks and identical ombre'd fringes \u2013 get to work in transforming me from a pastel-wearing norm to a dramatic, wild-haired romantic, and we chat about goth now. \"I don't think it's as rigid as it used to be,\" says Nicole, 25. \"You might feel like being a goth one day, and something else the next.\"</p> <p>Stepping into a goth look didn't feel as if there was no going back from black. A black velvet skater dress from Oasis had a touch of the Wednesday about it (always my favourite goth), and passed the supermarket test. It is after dark when this trend comes alive, obviously. While an empire-line Paul Smith number with lace straps was beautiful but a bit too much for real life, a Topshop chiffon frock with lace back and long layered skirt was fun for a night out. It was the makeup that really convinced me, though. Berry-coloured lips felt glam even when not worn with black. Knightley's, I'm told, is Chanel D\u00e9termin\u00e9e. That's what I'll be wearing for just enough gothic romance this winter \u2013 Halloween and beyond.</p>",

  "<p>Last month the authorities in Cairo whitewashed a mural that had become an international shrine to anti-establishment street art, raising the question of whether graffiti should be protected on the grounds of free speech.</p> <p>The wall in Muhammad Mahmoud Street paid tribute to the martyrs of the revolution, a memorial to hatred of the army and police, and to the rebellious spirit unleashed during and after the uprising. The day after the clean-up, graffiti artists of all persuasions gathered to restore the memorial. They wondered why the authorities were in such a hurry to efface images which for months had attracted tourists and analysts from all over the world. Some suspected that overzealous officials, encouraged by the new Islamist regime, might be tempted to censor pictures supposedly banned by Islam.</p> <p>But it seems that the motives of the newly appointed authorities are much more prosaic. In the past few weeks the new governors appointed by President Mohamed Morsi have been busily cleaning up the streets of Cairo and Alexandria with an enthusiasm only equalled by the widespread disrespect for the authorities that developed under former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hosni-mubarak\" title=\"\">President Hosni Mubarak</a>.</p> <p>Mubarak kept social unrest under control by allowing whole swaths of the population to work and find housing with total disregard for the rules. At best such policies fostered indifference to the law, but in many case they fuelled outright hatred of the authorities. How is Egypt's new-found democracy to put down roots with such a legacy?</p> <p>In the absence of any far-reaching reforms the public space has become, since Morsi's election, the focus of a wild drive to patch up appearances. Apparently inspired by some unrealistic desire to turn over a completely new leaf, the Muslim Brotherhood is determined to clean up the streets of Egypt, before even beginning to purge the rotten apparatus of state.</p> <p>Around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_Square\" title=\"\">Tahrir Square</a>, stripped of its tents, gardeners are planting flowers and palm trees. Meanwhile squads of police track down any errant graffiti and harass the thousands of roaming vendors who clog the city streets. Surely this is an unfortunate initiative in an overpopulated megacity where the informal economy represents more than a third of gross domestic product.</p> <p>On 7 September the police in Alexandria raided the historic used-book market on <a href=\"http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/after-police-raid-state-reconciles-al-nabi-daniel-book-vendors\" title=\"\">Nabi Daniel Street</a>, kicking over stalls, tearing up books and smashing shelves. This operation caused such an outcry that the culture minister in person expressed his disapproval.</p> <p>As part of their cleaning frenzy the Brothers have also instructed several groups of well-meaning youths to deal with the heaps of rubbish which block the streets of towns all over Egypt. This cosmetic initiative drew sarcastic comments from the rag trade, which has been struggling to cope with the problem for decades.</p> <p>The victims of the police clampdown are not fooled by the authorities' dreams of flowerbeds and superficial tidying. Skulking in the entrances to buildings, street vendors are quick to voice their resentment. \"To restore confidence the government should start by making gifts to people, rather than depriving them of the little they have,\" said one trader struggling to keep hold of his goods. \"Apart from the rubbish,\" he added, stumbling over a heap of junk.</p> <p>Any hopes of graffiti being legalised seem extremely unlikely, even if on the day after the destruction of the Muhammad Mahmoud mural the prime minister, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesham_Qandil\" title=\"\">Hisham Qandil</a>, expressed reservations, condemning the whitewash and encouraging street artists to produce new graffiti on Tahrir Square \"true to the spirit of the revolution\".</p> <p>The response was almost immediate. \"If you change your trousers without having a wash you get a rash\", read the message on a wall in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talaat_Harb_Street\" title=\"\">Talaat Harb Street</a>. And in Muhammad Mahmoud Street itself there was a face poking out its tongue in defiance and saying: \"Erase it again, you cowardly regime\".</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article appeared in the </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from Le Monde</em></p>",

This is the part of physics concerned with the interaction between light and matter at the quantum level, so between individual particles of light, photons, and matter, such as atoms or ions (which are atoms but with electrons missing). Haroche and Wineland have been able to do experiments which involve manipulating individual particles while maintaining their quantum nature; this is very difficult to achieve because particles tend to interact with the environment and then behave in a classical (non-quantum) manner.</p> <p>Quantum optics may offer a route to implementing quantum computers, which some researchers believe will bring an advance in computing power far beyond what present systems offer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Prof <a href=\"http://www.jimal-khalili.com/\">Jim Al-Khalili</a> of the University of Surrey:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Very exciting \u2013 this year\u2019s Nobel Prize recognises some of the most incredible experimental tests of the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics.

Here are some of the things he said.</p> <p>On finding out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was lucky - I was in the street and passing a bench so I was able to sit down immediately. I was walking with my wife going back home and when I saw the area code 46, then I sat down. [When I saw] the Swedish code I realised it was real. It\u2019s fairly overwhelming. I immediately called my children and then my closest colleagues, without whom I would never have got this prize. One of them was lecturing and I sent him a text. He answered me \u201cI am in the middle of a lecture, I\u2019ll call you back later\u201d. I sent a text back saying, \u201cinterrupt your lecture and call me back immediately\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>What he will do to celebrate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think I will do is call my colleagues and children and we will have champagne at home and in the afternoon I will go back to the office and the lab.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about the potential use of his work Haroche cited past examples of basic physics research, such as lasers, nuclear magnetic resonance, that were done without specific applications in mind:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The manipulation of quantum systems belongs to the same kind of physics. There is a lot of things to learn at the fundamental level and some application will come but it\u2019s very hard to say which one. Maybe it will be some kind of computer, maybe it will be in quantum simulations or quantum communications.</p> </blockquote> <p>Did he expect to get the Nobel prize?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I did not see it coming. There are a lot of people in the world who deserve the prize, working in a lot of interesting areas. I just consider myself as just one of the possible choices. i did not think it was highly probable and I tried not to think about it in advance. I am also very glad to share it with Dave Wineland because he\u2019s a fantastic physicist and to be in his company is certainly a great pleasure for me and great recognition.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-eb29cffd-9e6f-468f-a009-ffc30bd8ab7c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/9/1349782299694/Serge-Haroche-winner-of-2-010.jpg\" alt=\"Serge Haroche, winner of 2012 Nobel prize in physics, with Igor Dotsenko\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French physicist Serge Haroche (right), and his assistant Igor Dotsenko at work in Paris, 2009.

For single particles of light or matter the laws of classical physics cease to apply and quantum physics takes over. But single particles are not easily isolated from their surrounding environment and they lose their mysterious quantum properties as soon as they interact with the outside world. Thus many seemingly bizarre phenomena predicted by quantum physics could not be directly observed, and researchers could only carry out thought experiments that might in principle manifest these bizarre phenomena.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Both Laureates work in the field of quantum optics studying the fundamental interaction between light and matter, a field which has seen considerable progress since the mid-1980s. Their ground-breaking methods have enabled this field of research to take the very first steps towards building a new type of super fast computer based on quantum physics. Perhaps the quantum computer will change our everyday lives in this century in the same radical way as the classical computer did in the last century. The research has also led to the construction of extremely precise clocks that could become the future basis for a new standard of time, with more than hundred-fold greater precision than present-day caesium clocks.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://blog.vixra.org/2012/10/09/nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-to-serge-haroche-and-david-wineland/\">ViXra blog</a>, \"this work was widely predicted as a possibility for the prize.\"</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T10:30:14.873Z\">at 11.30am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073e4edc0e361310bc6ca3f\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:04:31.204Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/oct/08/nobel-prize-2012-live-medicine-physiology\">excitement of yesterday's Nobel prize in physiology or medicine</a>, will the physics prize live up to expectations?</p> <p>We will find out in just under an hour, when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm makes the latest in its long line of prestigious prizes. This is the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/\">prize all physicists want</a>, a chance to be remembered in the same pantheon as <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html\">Max Planck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html\">Richard Feynman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html\">Niels Bohr</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/\">Marie Curie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html\">Werner Heisenberg</a> and, of course, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html\">Albert Einstein</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/\">Last year's prize</a> went to Saul Perlmutter, Brian P Schmidt and Adam G Riess for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae. <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/\">The year before that</a>, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, both based at the University of Manchester, won the Nobel for their \"groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene\u201d.</p> <p>Predictions for the winner of this year's prize are, as usual, a shot in the dark.

  "<p>The under-representation of women in peace deals is symptomatic of a much wider risk to humankind: namely, from the gross power disparities between women and men throughout both industrialised and developing societies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/20/harmony-women-peace-deals?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Women are creating harmony, but only men broker peace deals, 28 September)</a>.</p> <p>In a male-dominated world it is not generally recognised that women are more broadly intelligent, less bellicose, more skilled in conciliation and more caring than men, with a greater concern for the survival and wellbeing of children. Demographic research has demonstrated that the best correlation with increased life expectancy and smaller families in developing countries is female literacy in primary schools, leading to the best hope for stabilising global population.</p> <p>The UN security council has manifestly failed in its 2000 resolution to allow equal participation for women in \"the maintenance and promotion of sustainable peace\". Stability, sanity and sustainability for our unstable world might be restored if the UN resolution were urgently implemented and some of the obscenely wasted resources that are devoted to military hardware were siphoned off to establish universal education and health services. Perhaps the next director general of the UN should be a woman?</p> <p><strong>Bryan Furnass</strong></p> <p>Canberra, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 On reading your item on female peace-brokers, I couldn't help but think that the whole report somehow misses the point. Yes, I certainly believe that women make better peace-brokers than men but is it really the peace-brokers who broker peace? Or is it not more often the case that peace comes when the power-brokers or the power-holders decide that a state of war no longer serves their needs?</p> <p>For example, neither women nor men can negotiate with a drone that is being guided in to take out some \"evil-doer\" in a remote Afghan village. But once the US decides that Afghanistan and Pakistan have been pacified enough to let the interested parties move their central Asian oil and gas through that country, then some figure will \"magically\" broker a peace ... which at the end of the day only happens because the powers-that-be decree so.</p> <p>And furthermore is war not sometimes the correct path to take? Imagine that you are an African fisherman from Somalia and your agriculture minister has sold off fishing rights to the EU and parked that money in his account in Z\u00fcrich: surely in this case it is your duty to go to war and to fight off the foreign trawlers? The tragedy here is that this normally leads to the disintegration of law and order in your country, a situation that is often helped along by international powers targeting your country with sanctions and the like.</p> <p>It is not very relevant to analyse who are the best peace-brokers. It would be better to remove the cause of war, that is all too often thinly veiled commercial interest.</p> <p><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong></p> <p>Cologne, Germany</p> <p>\u2022 Thank you for your lifegiving thoughts on women as peacemakers. Three years ago my son and a colleague visited Afghanistan to research a policy document on the conflict; they conducted interviews across the cultural spectrum, from tribal leaders to Nato.</p> <p>Yet not a single woman was consulted. While I honoured the courage and intent of their journey, it still seemed to be ultimately a discourse by, with, about and for patriarchy. How could the same segregated, gendered consciousness \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 that had created such chaos and anguish even begin to resolve the nightmare?</p> <p>Your article has transformed my disquieted maternal mutterings into a shout, dares me to dream out loud of the day when the restoration, keeping and making of peace replaces the lie of war as our central cultural narrative.</p> <p><strong>Annie March</strong></p> <p>West Hobart, Tasmania, Australia</p> <p><strong>Inequality is the problem</strong></p> <p>I wonder why journalists continue to tie the economy to living conditions in their countries: \"millions of families will struggle ... to raise their incomes\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/22/living-standards-report-divided-britain?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Living standards report shows bleak future of a divided Britain, 28 September)</a>. Wilkinson and Pickett have documented in The Spirit Level that there is little correlation between living conditions and the economic wealth of developed countries. There is almost complete correlation between inequality of income and health and social conditions. For example, Portugal and the US are at opposite ends of the economic wealth spectrum, almost identical in inequality of income and in an index of health and social problems. Sweden and Japan have low inequality of income and the least health and social problems.</p> <p>Thus the creation of more jobs and increasing the wealth of the country will not result in better living conditions. Two-income families becoming one-income families will provide jobs for unemployed people and with that, lower welfare costs and lower income inequality. Quit work and improve living conditions. Heresy I hear? The data is there.</p> <p><strong>Art Campbell</strong></p> <p>Ottawa, Canada</p> <p><strong>The limits of speech</strong></p> <p>Regarding Free speech: who sets the limits <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/conservatives-democrats-free-speech-muslims?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(21 September)</a>: if free speech has to be curtailed to protect the feelings of the followers of various religions, I would like to demand similar protection for the numerous people like me whose views are mainly based on reason and scientific evidence. In particular, I take offence at people who publicly cast doubt on the theory of evolution or the fact that man-made climate change is happening.</p> <p><strong>Egbert von Steuber</strong></p> <p>Lingen, Germany</p> <p>\u2022 I find your comment on freedom of speech a bit puzzling. What is so important about speech? What about freedom of attitude, say extreme antisemitism, or freedom of behaviour, for that matter? Admittedly curbing speech would present problems but so would not doing so. Is it that those in the word business are a little precious about speech?</p> <p><strong>Ken Bragan</strong></p> <p>Wanaka, New Zealand</p> <p><strong>Put our house in order</strong></p> <p>The uproar over an abusive little film can only be explained by real injury to Arabs and Muslims, not just in a promiscuous war on terrorism but over centuries of colonial occupation, economic exploitation and political corruption <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/violent-protests-blowback-us-intervention\" title=\"\">(Surprise is that there aren't more protests, 28 September)</a>. This theatre of cruelty is ongoing, most bitterly in Iraq and Afghanistan, drone strikes on Pakistan and annexation of Jerusalem. Symbolic insults are blown up by media and fall as salt in open wounds.</p> <p>If we look to an Arab spring or moderate Islam for balanced responses or transformation from within, the best we can do is put our own houses in order and make amends where our help is most widely sought. A good starting point would be respect of international law and human rights in Palestine.</p> <p><strong>Greg Wilkinson</strong></p> <p>Swansea, UK</p> <p><strong>The wife of Jesus?</strong></p> <p>Tom Holland's article on the newly found Gospel of Jesus's Wife was refreshingly sane, compared to recent comments in some of the media <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/sep/19/jesus-wife-christianity-authorised-history\" title=\"\">(Jesus's wife adds fresh perspective, 28 September)</a>. He is so right to say this fourth-century document sheds no light on the historical Jesus, for the Jesus of the first century was not married to Mary Magdalene.</p> <p>When he was on the cross, four women gazed up at him: his mother, Mary; his aunt; Mary, the wife of Clopas; and Mary Magdalene. However, almost the last words he said committed his mother Mary into the care of the one male disciple standing there. If he had been married to Mary Magdalene, his first duty would have been to her, not to his mother, and he would have committed Mary Magdalene into that disciple's care.</p> <p><strong>Michael Penny</strong></p> <p>Reading, UK</p> <p><strong>Improving democracy</strong></p> <p>The two leaders in your 21 September issue imply that our politicians are failing us <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/climate-change-arctic-melts-editorial\" title=\"\">(All that is solid melts into water</a>;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/14/netherlands-election-editorial\" title=\"\"> Fool's gold</a>). And they are. Unfortunately people believe that you have to have them in charge and that they have to be elected. This is incorrect.</p> <p>If we adopt sortition \u2013 appointing representatives by random selection from the citizenship \u2013 then we obviate politicians and dispense with elections. This is not just an alternative way of selecting our representative but a more democratic way \u2013 which 2,500 years ago the Athenians recognised \u2013 realising that voting isn't a feature of a democracy but one of an oligarchy \u2013 which it is.</p> <p>Regrettably, many people don't even know what sortition is. We'll have to put up with the current situation \u2013 unless, of course, we launch a campaign for sortition! Any takers?</p> <p><strong>Bill Harper</strong></p> <p>London, UK</p> <p><strong>Briefly</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I'd like to point out to PD Smith <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/07/straphanger-taras-grescoe-review?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(28 September)</a> that <em>les carosses \u00e0 cinq sols</em> were cheap coach rides, the word <em>sol</em> being the old form of the word <em>sou</em>, a small denomination coin. <em>Un carosse \u00e0 cinq sols</em> was the equivalent of a penny bus ride (or less). The coaches went out of business when the price went up to <em>six</em> and then <em>sept sols</em>.</p> <p><strong>Les Clack</strong></p> <p>Paris, France</p>",
  "<p>I spent three years teaching at the <a href=\"http://www.theboxingacademy.co.uk/\">London Boxing Academy Community Project</a> (LBACP) in Tottenham, North London, where the 2011 summer riots began. The aim of the LBACP was the make use of the traditionally strong relationships that boxing coaches hold with wayward young men, in an educational setting.</p> <p>The students were mostly black boys, all of whom had been excluded or were at risk of exclusion. I was employed to teach at the LBACP by the Westminster thinktank <a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk\">Civitas</a>, which believes that with the right methods, anyone can get a decent education.</p> <p>The project was set up through the <a href=\"http://www.londonboxingacademy.co.uk\">London Boxing Academy</a>, and a later incarnation of the project called <a href=\"http://www.theboxingacademy.co.uk\">The Boxing Academy</a> (that I was not involved in) was one of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/dec/09/christmas-charity-appeal-boxing-academy-london\">Guardian's chosen charities for its Christmas Appeal</a>.</p> <p>When I taught, there was always a boxer or boxing coach in the room, who served as a teaching assistant, mentor and (sometimes) minder. They were called pod leaders, and they provided positive male role models for the students. The students were taught a reduced curriculum of core subjects (to GCSE standard), and so were able to spend up to half their timetable doing sport. They liked sport, so unlike when they were in mainstream, they wanted to come to school, and this made providing them with an education enormously easier. </p> <p>My book about the project and working with the inspirational principal Chris Hall, a boxing coach of 30 years standing, is called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boxing-Clever-Alternative-Provision-Traditional-Relationships/dp/1906837430/ref=pd_rhf_se_p_img_2\">Boxing Clever</a>. The book is based on diaries that I kept during my time teaching.</p> <p>One of the events that I recorded in the diaries centred on a girl called Laura in the book. The students at the LBACP had a peculiar knack for getting at the truth in the most cutting, blunt manner, but Laura was exceptional. That lesson, Laura was having a temper tantrum because she did not want to work at a desk (she sat on a chair in the corner of the room). I insisted that she sat at a desk. This was around the time that I was organising a trip to Oxford University, where I had studied as an undergraduate, something that the students found fascinating. Indeed, Laura, after jumping up and smashing my plastic bin into a thousand pieces, and telling me that she was \"not some fucking dog\", and informed me quite correctly \u2013 as she was shepherded out the door by the pod leader \u2013 that I \"was not in fucking Oxford now\".</p> <p>One thing that Laura was getting at in her tirade was that there is a knowledge gap between alternative provision and the mainstream. Mainstream teachers rarely have much experience of alternative provision, and visa-versa, which is clearly to the detriment of both. So, what are the lessons for mainstream teachers from what I did?</p> <p>First, that boxing can be a solution for troublesome kids. Boxing teaches respect and self-control in extreme situations (for example, being bashed on the nose). It is an outlet for aggression. And, as I have said, boxing coaches have a record of sorting out even the most difficult of delinquents. This is partly because boxing coaches are interested in something the boys are good at, whereas most people have to concentrate on all the things they are bad at. But it is mostly because boxing coaches give up one-to-one quality time, often for nothing, when most people are just too busy. That's why Laura put up with her pod leader shepherding her out the door \u2013 she trusted him. Although we immersed our students in the sport \u2013 the school was literally in a boxing gym \u2013 it is perfectly possible to use boxing in mainstream schools. For example, I know that <a href=\"http://www.harrismerton.org.uk\">Harris Academy Merton</a> (the academy that replaced the secondary school I attended in south London) runs a <a href=\"http://www.bigtboxingclub.piczo.com/?cr=6\">mentoring programme</a> with a local boxing gym. You could too.</p> <p>Second, mainstream is not the Holy Grail. Many people ask me \"how many students went back to mainstream?\" but this question misses the point. For those students, mainstream was not the best place for them. They couldn't cope with it, and they would soon deteriorate if they went back. So consider, why do we cram everyone into mainstream schools, as if providing an education is like manufacturing a widget? The 40% or so who do not achieve the benchmark GCSE grades are deemed to have failed \u2013 so why don't we try something different with more of them than we do today? Consider, in your school, which of your students would be happier and more successful in an alternative provision project based around sport, or caring for animals, or a trade. Then, do something about it, and avoid a possible future exclusion. Who is your Laura?</p> <p>Third lesson is that kindness and care can bridge any divide. Race, class and culture are irrelevant when you show your humanity. Teachers know that, obviously - but I'm saying that it works even with the hard cases that are on the way towards exclusion. Our principal, Chris Hall was able to hold positive relationships with even the most difficult students because he genuinely liked the students, and they knew it. Chris' mantra was that \"rules without relationships ain't worth toffee\". For Chris, that meant having access to the rule-maker, so that the students could get their grievances off their chest. It also meant that Chris' relationship with the students was used to make the students want to obey the rules because they wanted to please Chris. Chris and I built those relationships by visiting the students' families in their homes, going to court to support them when they were charged with criminal offences, and by organising trips that took them out of their familiar surrounding (for example to Oxford and to the <a href=\"http://www.londonrussianballetschool.com\">ballet</a>).</p> <p>Fourth, that tragedy stalks teachers who work in the alternative provision sector. My favourite student, who I taught to read in my spare time and who I was trying to get a job for this summer, was <a href=\"http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/crime-court/man_charged_with_murder_over_stabbing_of_tottenham_man_1_1444994\">murdered on 11 July this year</a>. He was one of the main characters in my book. I have been <a href=\"http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/crime-court/teachers_launch_appeal_fund_for_tottenham_stab_victim_s_funeral_1_1478119\">fundraising for his funeral</a>, which is taking place this Friday. This is an extreme example of my final lesson from my time in Tottenham: that you have to be tough to work with children who are at risk of being excluded.</p> <p><em>Tom Ogg is the author of Boxing Clever - a book about his experiences teaching at the London Boxing Academy Community Project.

  "<p>The new justice secretary's announcement that he will let householders deploy \"disproportionate\" force defending homes and families has been greeted by criminal lawyers with dismay.</p> <p>Chris Grayling's determination to reform the frequently reviewed laws of self defence was described as a vote-catching initiative that will be difficult to translate into legislation.</p> <p>Speaking at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, Grayling said: \"Being confronted by an intruder in your own home is terrifying, and the public should be in no doubt that the law is on their side. That is why I am strengthening the current law.</p> <p>\"Householders who act instinctively and honestly in self defence are victims of crime and should be treated that way. We need to dispel doubts in this area once and for all.\"</p> <p>The current law already allows people to use \"reasonable force\" to defend themselves (either at home or on the street), to protect others, to prevent crime or to protect property.</p> <p>Section 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 says the degree of force used in self-defence must be \"reasonable in the circumstances\" as the person acting genuinely believed them to be.</p> <p>The justification of acting \"honestly and instinctively\", taken from one key judgment widely relied upon, is already embedded in Crown Prosecution Service guidance.</p> <p>But the justice secretary wants to change the definition. Use of \"disproportionate force\" is not currently lawful. Grayling will allow householders to use force that they \"believed was reasonable in the circumstances but was actually disproportionate when viewed with the benefit of hindsight\", the Ministry of Justice said.</p> <p>This will, it appears, expand the current discretion of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to decide whether or not to prosecute. The <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/index.html\" title=\"\">CPS updated its guidance on the law of self defence only in May this year</a>.</p> <p>The recent case that revived interest in self-defence laws involved Andy and Tracey Ferrie, who used a legally held shotgun to defend their remote Leicestershire cottage. The intruders were injured. The Ferries were held for 40 hours by police but were not charged.</p> <p>There are relatively few prosecutions of householders who use force against intruders. An informal trawl by the CPS suggests that between 1990 and 2005 there were only 11 prosecutions of people who attacked intruders in houses, commercial premises or private land. Only seven of those resulted from domestic burglaries.</p> <p>Last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/burglary-offence-person-senior-judge\" title=\"\">the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, implied there was sufficient leeway in the law as it stands </a>to protect householders from unnecessary prosecution.</p> <p>Householders who defend themselves against burglars should not be expected to exercise \"calm cool judgment\", he explained. \"You are not calmly detached. You are probably very cross and very frightened \u2013 a mixture of both \u2026 the householder is entitled to use all sorts of reasonable force to get rid of the burglar.\"</p> <p>Responding to Grayling's initiative, Michael Turner QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: \"It's a vote-catcher. There's no concept elsewhere in British law of allowing anyone to use disproportionate force for pretty obvious reasons.</p> <p>\"It's no surprise that a non-lawyer [Grayling] would come up with such a crazy idea. Are we really saying that the police should not even investigate cases [where an intruder has been injured]? I can't believe this will make it into statute.\"</p> <p>Richard Atkinson, the chair of the Law Society's criminal committee, which represents solicitors, said: \"Whatever he comes up with will have to be very clear to be well defined. Grayling is setting himself a difficult task.</p> <p>\"Will it apply to commercial property as well as homes? There needs to be consultation on it. It will have judicial consequences in many other areas.\"</p> <p>Maura McGowan QC, vice-chairman of the Bar Council, said: \"The law on self defence is perfectly clear. Householders are fully entitled to use proportionate force to defend themselves and their property, which is a principle which we support. At a time when fundamental principles of open justice are under threat from ill-considered legislation and severe cuts, it is regrettable that chasing populist headlines is top of the new justice secretary's agenda.\"</p> <p>Another criminal barrister, David Farrer QC, was equally dismissive of the proposal. \"Once again another government is pledging to reform self-defence laws,\" he said. \"We have seen the same populist sentiments from successive governments. However, the realities are that there is no need to reform the current laws.</p> <p>\"In practice, the application of the reasonable force test is perfectly straightforward and is applied to facts of each individual case. The CPS in recent years has caught the mood of the country and is making sensible decisions on bringing prosecutions in self-defence incidents.\"</p>",
  "<p>Newcastle United has agreed a four-year sponsorship deal with payday lender Wonga. But the club's fans, who do not seem at all pleased by the association with the UK's highest profile payday lender, could end up a good deal worse off if they trust the endorsement of the Wonga logo on the team's shirt and take out a loan.</p> <p>Just in case you are tempted to borrow from WongaNewcastle's new sponsor, here are 10 things it pays to remember:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Wonga's interest rate is an eye-watering 4,214% APR. The company argues it charges \"just\" 1% a day, and that the APR figure is distorted and inappropriate because it assumes the money is borrowed for a whole year while Wonga loans last a maximum of 30 days. But many other payday lenders operate on the same basis and still manage to have lower APRs.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Wonga's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/16/wonga-trebles-earnings-loans\" title=\"Wonga trebles earnings as income rises 225%\">income rose 269% to \u00a345.8m in 2011</a>. The highest paid director received \u00a3635,000. That's a lot of money generated by people paying just 1% a day.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Wonga says it lends responsibly, using thousands of bits of data available online to check an applicant is employed and can afford to repay the loan. But the Guardian and Observer has spoken to several borrowers, including some put forward by Wonga itself, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/oct/01/pay-day-loans\" title=\"Pay-day loans: making money from other people's misfortune?\">were either living on benefits</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/01/wonga-real-cost-payday-loan\" title=\"Wonga: the real cost of a payday loan\">whose income has been halved</a>. In response, Wonga's founder Errol Damelin admits they don't always get it right.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Other lenders \u2013 credit card companies, personal loan and mortgage lenders \u2013 may refuse to lend to someone if they see evidence they have borrowed from any payday lender, including Wonga. They regard this type of borrowing as a sign the applicant is struggling financially, and therefore has a high risk of not repaying. Mortgage lender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jul/12/ge-money-refuses-mortages-payday-loans?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">GE Money</a> says it will not lend to applicants who have taken out a payday loan in the past three months, even if they have paid it back on time and without problem.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> The Office of Fair Trading told Wonga in May it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/may/22/oft-criticises-wonga-debt-collection\" title=\"OFT criticises Wonga debt collection practices\">must improve its debt collection practices</a>, and threatened to fine the firm. The warning came after the lender sent letters in 2010 to borrowers who were struggling with repayments suggesting they might be guilty of fraud. In the letter Wonga said it would consider contacting the police if the customers did not act as Wonga requested.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Wonga tried to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jan/12/wonga-withdraws-student-loans-information?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"Wonga withdraws student loans information\">profit from the financial struggles suffered by cash-strapped students</a> by targeting them with information on its website. The company took this down after the Guardian brought it to light, but not before the National Union of Students described the firm as \"highly irresponsible\" for carrying out what it called \"predatory marketing\".</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> Wonga boasts about the speed with which it can get money into your account, taking just 15 minutes from application to delivery. But some people who have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/14/wonga-defends-loans-process-fraudulent-repayments?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">suffered identity theft and loss of money from their current accounts</a> are wondering whether the speed of its checks and the way loans are set up is to blame.</p> <p><strong>8.</strong> Wonga's marketing style suggests its business is about helping people make fun lifestyle choices (\"You've just remembered your wedding anniversary with hours to spare \u2026 Don't worry, Wonga it!\"). But the Advertising Standards Authority has <a href=\"http://www.brandrepublic.com/go/news/article/1015873/loans-company-wonga-rapped-light-hearted-ads\" title=\"Brand Republic: Loans firm Wonga rapped for light-hearted ads\">taken some of Wonga's most cheerful adverts off the air</a>, ruling that the \"light-hearted presentation of the ad was likely to mislead about the nature and implications of the product\".</p> <p><strong>9.</strong> Stella Creasy, Labour shadow home affairs minister, describes payday lenders as legal loan sharks and has <a href=\"http://www.workingforwalthamstow.org.uk/fight-back-against-the-legal-loan-sharks-download-our-campaign-pack-here/\" title=\"Fight Back Against the Legal Loan Sharks- Download Our Campaign Pack Here!\">produced a campaign pack available on her website</a>.

  "<p>Sickipedia, the site where the young Lancashire man Matthew Woods found inspiration to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/08/april-jones-matthew-woods-jailed\" title=\"\">post \"jokes\" about the missing child April Jones</a> on his Facebook page was \"down for maintenance\" when I tried to check it out this morning, though I managed to get a glimpse of the kind of content it publishes courtesy of Twitter.</p> <p>I'll reproduce just one, which should come with the equivalent of one of those taste and decency disclaimers you get on TV: \"My dick is a lot like Marmite. My wife hates it when I rub it on her toast\". That was from May. That alone should allow you to conclude, if you hadn't already realised from its name, that this site is for the seriously sad and inadequate. That should be the end of the story. The decision of Woods, however, to reproduce \"jokes\" about April Jones and Madeleine McCann has led him to be sent for 12 weeks to a young offenders' institution. Prior to that he had been taken into protective custody to prevent him being lynched.</p> <p>Woods pleaded guilty to sending by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive. In mitigation, his lawyer cited a \"moment of drunken stupidity\", but the presiding magistrate said the comments were so \"abhorrent\" he deserved the longest sentence the court could hand down. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed it had reviewed the file and was content with the prosecution going ahead.</p> <p>Woods's case is by no means an exception. The CPS is currently reviewing its approach to social media in the light of several cases in which substantial sentences have been handed down after people have posted offensive remarks on Twitter and Facebook or sent them directly via email.</p> <p>These cases have included the 56-day jail sentence for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/22/muamba-twitter-abuse-student-sorry\" title=\"\">student who tweeted offensive and racist comments</a> in response to the on-pitch collapse of the Bolton footballer Fabrice Muamba. The latest example is the case of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-19883828\" title=\"\">a young man who has been sentenced to a community order</a> for posting the message \"all soldiers should die and go to hell\" on Facebook after the death of six British soldiers in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Perhaps the highest profile case is still the \"Twitter joke trial\", when 28-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/27/twitter-joke-trial-high-court\" title=\"\">Paul Chambers was found guilty of sending a \"menacing\" tweet</a> for threatening to \"blow up\" Robin Hood airport near Doncaster after it was closed by snow. That conviction \u2013 in a case ridiculously pushed by the CPS \u2013 was quashed in the high court, but only after a prolonged legal battle in which he was supported by a number of celebrities.</p> <p>The judgment that day set what seemed like a new benchmark: \"If the person or persons who receive or read it, (the message) or may reasonably be expected to receive, or read it, would brush it aside as a silly joke, or a joke in bad taste, or empty bombastic or ridiculous banter, then it would be a contradiction in terms to describe it as a message of a menacing character.\"</p> <p>This was not a case of anything goes, the judges implied, but be careful not to mistake stupidity \u2013 no matter how offensive the remarks might be \u2013 with criminality.</p> <p>The same surely applies to the Sickipedia story. Direct incitement to violence is one thing. But we cannot and should not sentence people for bad jokes, poor taste and terrible manners. That is an issue for parents, teachers and, most importantly, peer groups.</p> <p>In late July, police visited a teenager in Weymouth after he had posted an abusive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/31/teenager-arrested-tweets-tom-daley\" title=\"\">tweet about the Olympic diver Tom Daley</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/31/twitter-twits-tom-daley-ignore\" title=\"\">I commented then</a> that the best response from Daley (who had retweeted the offending missive) and the authorities would have been no response at all. This, I suggested, was the online equivalent of the boy on the park bench or the bore propping up the bar in the pub.</p> <p>The following day I received an email from a chief constable thanking me. Law enforcement, he suggested, should get on with investigating serious crimes.</p>",

The NHS no less, reinforcing stigma and taboo.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-19875643\" title=\"\">Legality of first Welsh bill challenged at Supreme Court</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074919/calls-childcarers-registered-amid-deregulation-fears\" title=\"\">Calls for all childcarers to be registered amid deregulation fears</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/13532/parkinsons_uk_income_up_by_1m\" title=\"\">Parkinson's UK income up by \u00a31m</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2012/10/09/118582/council-wrongly-charged-family-top-up-fees-for-care-home-place.html\" title=\"\">Council wrongly charged family top-up fees for care home place</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/spending-cuts-on-legal-services-will-deny-effective-access-to-justice-says-leading-barrister-8203361.html\" title=\"\">Spending cuts on legal services will deny 'effective access' to justice, says leading barrister</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/tenancies/tories-pledge-right-to-buy-campaign/6524109.article\" title=\"\">Tories pledge right to buy campaign</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=107245\" title=\"\">Osborne confirms third-year council tax freeze</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9595323/Victims-to-pick-offenders-punishment-Home-Secretary-says.html\" title=\"\">Victims to pick their offenders' punishment</a><br>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/Communications/article/1153792/jimmy-savile-charities-consider-changing-names-sex-abuse-allegations/\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile charities consider changing names after sex abuse allegations</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Some people want to tell you the Conservatives have abandoned their green pledges, but nothing could be further from the truth,\" the climate minister, Greg Barker, told his party conference in Birmingham on Tuesday. He repeated the denial several times, protesting a little too much. The only spontaneous applause from the sparse audience during the energy and environment session on the main stage was in favour of killing badgers.</p> <p>Owen Paterson, the new environment secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/05/badger-cull-tb-cattle\" title=\"\">has been uncompromising on the imminent badger cull</a>, aimed at curbing TB in cattle. He even laid claim to the policy as his own: \"I started this policy in opposition.\" The person who introduced him went even further, giving his work on fisheries credit as the \"intellectual underpinning\" for Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall's <a href=\"http://www.fishfight.net/\" title=\"\">Fish Fight</a>, though I'm not sure anyone has told Hugh.</p> <p>Paterson exudes confidence and felt sufficiently at home at the NFU's reception on Monday night to deride opposition to the badger cull as \"sad sentimentality.\" Moments before, a woman from <a href=\"http://www.bluebadger.org/\" title=\"\">Blue Badger</a> - Conservatives against the cull - had been forcibly told by a farmer that she needed re-education. Today, Paterson, who never misses an opportunity to mention the two pet badgers he kept as a child, described Labour's previous \"inaction\" as \"cowardly\", forgetting the mention it was their decade-long trial that is being used to justify the whole thing.</p> <p>But he also said something rather more revealing: \"We will start culling in two pilot areas to prove that it can bear down on the disease.\" I thought the government said its cull proposals were already science led, not a theory requiring proof. In any case, the pilots are only testing whether free shooting is humane, not whether the cull cuts TB.</p> <p>Paterson is generally calm and collected but almost leapt out of his chair with excitement after a question on shale gas at this morning's session. \"We issue the permits for drilling and there are half a dozen or so needed. We want to make that as simple as possible. The Environment Agency, who issue the licences, are setting up a one-stop-shop for companies.\" Combined with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-shale-gas-tax\" title=\"\">George Osborne's \"generous\" tax breaks for fracking, announced on Monday</a>, shale gas is the only beneficiary from any new policy at this conference: some may see that as telling.</p> <p>But the new energy minister, John Hayes, has defied his early billing as a windfarm hating sceptic. He accepted the need to cut emissions, talked about the Climate Change Act being \"the context is which all [energy policy] fits\" and said he would demand more action on cutting energy demand. He also talked sensibly about shale gas being very early stage and emphasised the different geology and geography in the UK, compared to the US where several decade of development has delivered a gas bonanza. That is smart, given than no one outside the fracking lobby thinks shale gas is going to transform the UK's energy supply and send prices plummeting. Even some informed Tories I spoke to dismissed the idea as \"nonsense\", noting that not one of BP, Shell, British Gas or Texaco are interested.</p> <p>Hayes also repeatedly talked about the urgent <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn12_105/pn12_105.aspx\" title=\"\">need to get communities onside with renewable energy</a>, ensuring they have a say on siting and most crucially benefits for their local area. Barker also emphasised the desire to drive the rollout of community energy: \" I want to see the big six challenged by the big 60,000.\" Again, this is smart, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jun/04/wind-farm-power-opposition\" title=\"\">as I have argued before</a>. Barker described the Tory approach as cost-effective action to meet green goals, characterising Labour's approach as \"dogmatic and hair shirt\".</p> <p>Despite the siren calls of shale gas luring the climate sceptics in the Tory party on to the rocks, a senior source has told me that David Cameron is now personally re-engaging with the green agenda. There will be a meeting of the all-powerful coalition quad - Cameron, Osborne, Clegg, Alexander - in the next week or so. \"The PM wants to bring the Treasury and Decc onto the same page,\" I was told. \"The Treasury has to sign up to the renewable energy agenda, while Decc has to reassure on costs.\" The prompt for Cameron's renewed interest is unsurprising - the strong economic growth being seen in the green economy, which employs a million people, more than teaching. I was told the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/05/green-growth-false-choice-cbi\" title=\"\">CBI's report on the green economy this summer was influential</a>, which it should be given the disastrous state of the UK economy overall.</p> <p>A renewed push by Cameron would be a welcome development, even if long overdue and only driven by his desperation for growth. Getting Osborne's thinking into the 21st century is the vital step. But, with Cameron's poor record since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\" title=\"\">pledging a few days after becoming PM that he would lead the \"greenest government ever\"</a>, people will believe things have changed when they see it.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson vowed to use his widespread popularity to shore up the Conservatives under David Cameron in the fight to stop the country \"lurching back\" to Labour at the next general election.</p> <p>Johnson used a tub-thumping speech to the party conference in Birmingham to stress his loyalty to the prime minister and make clear he intended to lend his weight to the incumbent Tory leader's campaign for a second term.</p> <p>Johnson sent a message to the party faithful amid widespread speculation that he may draw on his extraordinary popularity to make a bid for Cameron's job. Some polls have suggested he could give the Tories, who are trailing Labour by about 10 points, a massive boost with voters.</p> <p>Johnson, who beat Ken Livingstone in a rematch last May in an otherwise grim set of election results for the Tories, thanked activists who helped him to re-election as he outlined his achievements in the capital and the plans for his current term.</p> <p>\"You showed that we can overcome a Labour lead and win in the places which the two Eds are so cocky as to think that they own,\" said Johnson.</p> <p>Pointing to the smiling prime minister in the audience, he added: \"If we can win in a recession and wipe out a 17-point Labour lead, then I know that David Cameron will win in 2015, when the economy has turned round \u2013 and we are already seeing signs of progress \u2013 when people are benefiting from jobs and growth and the firm leadership you have shown and the tough decisions you have taken, not least coming along to hear this speech today.\"</p> <p>Giving his backing to the government's austerity programme, he drew on the success of the \"can do\" attitude of the Olympics to take the country forward, with British firms becoming \"gold medal winners\".</p> <p>\"Just as we all fought together this year to keep London from lurching back into the grip of a cabal of semi-Marxists and tax-funded Ch\u00e2teauneuf du Pape-swilling, tax minimisers \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 and car-hating bendy bus fetishists, I will join you in the fight to keep this country from lurching back into the grip of the two Eds \u2013 Balls and Miliband.</p> <p>\"Unreformed, under-punished, unrepentant about what they did to the economy and for the deficit that they racked up. And we need to go forward now from the age of excess under Labour through the age of austerity towards a new age of enterprise, when we do what we did during the Olympics. When we discovered so much about what we can do, and we built a world-beating platform for Britain and for British people and businesses to compete and to win and we need to do it now and we need to start here under the Conservatives.\"</p> <p>In a speech laced with humour, Johnson wished Cameron, who is 46 on Tuesday, a happy birthday.</p> <p>He then seized on the prime minister's description of him as a blond mop to joke: \"I was pleased to see that you called me a blond-haired mop in the papers. If I am a mop, David Cameron, you are a broom \u2013 a broom that is clearing up the mess left by the Labour government, and a fantastic job you are doing.</p> <p>\"I congratulate you and your colleagues George Osborne - the dustpan, Michael Gove \u2013 the J-cloth, William Hague \u2013 the sponge.</p> <p>\"It is the historic function of Conservative governments over the last 100 years to be the household implements on the floor of the house, so effective at clearing up after the Labour binge has got out of control.\"</p> <p>Drawing on the \"Ready Brek glow of happiness\" that triumphed over the gloomy predictions at the Olympics, he said Britain should remember what it is capable of.</p> <p>\"Some of us were frankly flabbergasted, gobsmacked. I want you to hold that thought and remember that feeling of surprise because that surprise is revealing of our chronic tendency in this country to underestimate what we can do.</p> <p>\"We need now to learn the lessons of the Olympics and the Paralympics, the moment where I think we collectively rediscovered that we are a 'can do' country, a creative, confident 'can do' country.\"</p> <p>Johnson praised politicians from across the party divide for their role in securing the Olympics, including the former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the former Olympics minister Tessa Jowell, and even his political foe, Ken Livingstone.</p> <p>\"I don't think Ken is going to come back from that one, he just got a clap from the Tory party conference,\" said Johnson. \"If that hasn't finished him nothing will.\"</p> <p>Setting out the lessons for the economy, the London mayor said investment in training and infrastructure \"allowed our young people to take on the best in the rest of the world and do better than them\".</p> <p>\"That is exactly what we have to do with the economy today,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>London's largest initial public offering of the year has been launched, with Russian tycoon Alisher Usmanov's mobile operator MegaFon confirming it intends to float before Christmas.</p> <p>Usmanov \u2013 who is Russia's richest man, according to Forbes, and the second largest shareholder in Arsenal football club \u2013 is not selling any of his MegaFon holding in the float but has already enjoyed a multimillion-dollar payday this year. He was one of the early investors in Facebook and sold shares in its record $16bn IPO in May.</p> <p>Usmanov took control of MegaFon in April, buying out fellow tycoon Mikhail Fridman through his company AF Telecom. Sources close to the float estimate it could raise $2bn (\u00a31.25bn), making it the biggest in London since Glencore's $10bn debut in May last year.</p> <p>Russia's No 2 mobile network by revenues and subscribers is expected to sell 15-20% of its shares, resulting in a partial exit for its other remaining shareholder, Sweden's TeliaSonera.</p> <p>The first of the big three Russian networks to offer 4G mobile internet connections, MegaFon said on Tuesday it expected to float its ordinary shares on the Micex exchange in Moscow and global depositary receipts on the London stock exchange \"in the fourth quarter of 2012\".</p> <p>Pre-roadshow meetings with potential investors are understood to be starting this week, with Morgan Stanley and Sberbank CIB leading the banking advisory team, and Citi, Credit Suisse and VTB Capital joining them as bookrunners. The new capital would be used to repay or finance existing debt and continue the expansion of the network.</p> <p>\"This is the right time for our IPO, which will support a new stage in MegaFon's development,\" the company's chief executive, Ivan Tavrin, said. \"We are now positioned to exploit the further growth potential of Russia's mobile market as it transitions from voice to high-value data services.\"</p> <p>Having invested heavily in 3G services, and with its 4G signal now available in 40 Russian cities, MegaFon has been at the forefront of the smartphone revolution and now controls more data revenues, which are generated by customers using the internet on their handsets, than any other operator.</p> <p>MegaFon's revenues totalled just under \u00a35bn in 2011, and have been growing at more than 15% annually for the last three years. It has 62 million subscribers and a 27% market share, according to AC&amp;M, which places it behind MTS (70 million customers) and ahead of Vimpelcom (56 million).</p> <p>In September, MegaFon asked the Russian markets regulator to allow it to list 123.38m shares, or 19.9% of the total, although more recent press reports have suggested the sale could be reduced to a 15% stake. If 15% of the shares are sold for \u00a31.25bn, the float would imply an overall valuation of \u00a38.3bn.</p> <p>Analyst James Britton, at Nomura bank, estimates that MegaFon's enterprise value \u2013 which includes equity and debt \u2013 is around \u00a311bn, equal to around 5.5 times the underlying earnings. The shares are expected to be sold at a discount to the enterprise value.</p> <p>TeliaSonera said on Tuesday it would sell down from 35.6% to 25% plus one share, while intending to retain \"a long-term strategic ownership\". AF Telecom owns 50% plus 100 shares, and will not sell into the IPO. The remaining 14.4% is held in treasury and the company is now deciding how many of these shares will go into the sale.</p>",
  "<p>A man who posted a Facebook message following the deaths of six British soldiers which said: \"All soldiers should die and go to hell\" has been sentenced to a community order and told to pay costs of \u00a3300 by magistrates.</p> <p>Azhar Ahmed, 20, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, admitted posting the message two days after the deaths of the soldiers in March this year but told a trial at Huddersfield magistrates court last month that he did not think it was offensive. The remarks were derogatory, disrespectful and inflammatory, the court ruled in September as a district judge found him guilty of a grossly offensive communication.</p> <p>He will complete 240 hours of community service over a two-year period, the court ruled.</p> <p>Sentencing him on Tuesday, the district judge Jane Goodwin told him he was \"particularly foolish\" and the damage caused by his comments, which could be seen by at least 600 Facebook users, had been substantial.</p> <p>\"You posted the message in response to tributes and messages of sympathy,\" she said. \"You knew at the time that this was an emotive and sensitive issue.\" She said with freedom of speech comes responsibility and on 8 March \"you failed to live up to that responsibility\".</p> <p>The comments were made two days after Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, of the 1st Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment was killed by a massive improvised explosive device on 6 March in the deadliest attack on British forces in Afghanistan for more than a decade alongside Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, Private Anthony Frampton, 20, Private Christopher Kershaw, 19, Private Daniel Wade, 20 and Private Daniel Wilford, 21, all of the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment.</p> <p>Ahmed made his comments on the social networking site two days later, writing: \"People gassin about the deaths of Soldiers! What about the familys who've been brutally killed. The women who have been raped. The children who have been sliced up!\" He went on to be abusive about soldiers.</p> <p>He told the court he had deleted the message as soon as he realised what reaction it was getting. He said he had replied with apologies to many people who had commented on his page, and when some told them they had lost relatives in Afghanistan, he realised how serious it had been. But he denied that the message was grossly offensive and said he thought it would just have been upsetting and caused distress.</p> <p>He said he was only trying to make his point that many other deaths in Afghanistan were being ignored.</p> <p>Nicholas Barker, defending Ahmed, said it was \"a serious matter\" but not one that warranted custody. He said Ahmed had initially been voicing legitimate concerns about the victims of war, but went on to overstep the mark. He added that when he realised the comments were causing distress, he removed them.</p> <p>The sentence was greeted with cries of \"disgusting\" from protesters in the public gallery, some of whom walked out while the judge was speaking. One man was detained by police while leaving the court after shouting out comments.</p> <p>On the steps of the court, a dozen police officers watched a crowd of demonstrators, many of whom appeared to be linked to far-right organisations. An hour later, Ahmed left the building via a side door, flanked by police officers and ran into a waiting car.</p> <p>At the trial in September, Goodwin said the law was not there to stop legitimate political opinion being strongly voiced. But she said the test was whether what had been written was \"beyond the pale of what is tolerable in our society\". She said Ahmed's post cleared this hurdle and she was satisfied that the message was grossly offensive.</p>",
  "<p>We are probably far enough into the mutuals agenda to make a few observations about how it's playing out. Half-time into the coalition \u2013 two and a half years in \u2013 we are now seeing a number of thoughtful contributions from both supporters and sceptics.</p> <p>However, people from all sides of the debate tend to agree about three big things.</p> <p>The first concerns pace. What all agree on is that the mutuals agenda is proceeding at a slower rate than was envisaged at the beginning of the coalition. Back then the talk was of \"millions\" of public sector workers stepping out into new mutuals. But we're now talking about tens of thousands at best and there have been about 50 new mutuals in the last year. In truth, we're still in early-adopter stage. &#xa0;</p> <p>The second fairly universal agreement is that the mutuals agenda is far too complicated for many in public services to readily take on. The lack of a clear legal pathway to set up public sector mutuals is a massive constraint. &#xa0;</p> <p>There is neither enabling legislation \u2013 the equivalent of an <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-12/academieshl.html\" title=\"\">Academies Act</a> \u2013 nor a simple route-map through the complexities of legal form or EU-compliant procurement. Compared to setting up public sector trading companies, mutualisation far more difficult.</p> <p>The third area of consensus is that the mutuals agenda doesn't fit very clearly into an overall story about what the coalition is seeking to do with public services. On the one hand, there is a clear commitment on \"diversity of supply\", as set out in the <a href=\"http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">open public services white paper</a>. On the other, there is little commitment at to any degree of market-making on the part of the government to ensure that mutuals are established in a procurement environment in which they could not initially hope to win.</p> <p>So, what would a half-time pep talk recommend for the rest of this parliament?</p> <p>There are two approaches \u2013 one ideal, the other firmly grounded in political reality. The ideal would be an aggressive approach, the equivalent of an academies bill, which would give any public service a legal right to set up as an independent corporation, rather in the way that schools can step out of local authority control. Such entities would work under contract for three to five years before being market-tested. &#xa0; &#xa0;</p> <p>Alongside this, a new legal form \u2013 the public service mutual \u2013 would be created, which could be a clear brand that could trade freely and end all of those constipated conversations about legal form that confuse and deter public bodies from moving forward. &#xa0;</p> <p>Finally, the coalition should say something about mutualisation being a preferred vehicle for public service divestment. This happened in Suffolk council and encouraged lots of staff to come forward with proposals. If we are to see more mutuals, a return to the pioneering language of 2010 is needed from the Cabinet Office and beyond.</p> <p>So far, so idealistic. What, in more workaday terms, do we need from the rest of the coalition's term? I would actually settle for the following three things: &#xa0;</p> <p>First, the consolidation of all capital funds for mutuals into a single pot which is then augmented by both <a href=\"http://www.bigsocietycapital.com/\" title=\"\">Big Society Capital</a> and private funds. This could then be split into start-up grants and longer-term funds to develop these companies. &#xa0; &#xa0;</p> <p>Second, I would simplify the <a href=\"http://mutuals.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Mutuals Support Service</a>. We are hearing that people find it too complicated and over-engineered. As a result, everything is taking too long. As a result, only a handful of grants have been made.&#xa0;I have changed my mind on this, I admit. I had thought that funds would be better centralised to save money and ensure knowledge-sharing. But civil servants based in Whitehall are not the best people to buy advisory services for new mutuals in Minehead or Manchester. &#xa0;</p> <p>Third and finally, the agenda needs a political shot-in-the-arm from the prime minister. People on the ground need to know the government is still on their side if they are doing this. People wonder if mutuals are still on the coalition's radar or if instead they have gone the way of 'big society' or other Steve Hilton ideas \u2013 all subsumed by larger economic concerns.</p> <p>Even without legislation, large amounts of public money or a clear political direction, the mutuals agenda is doing surprisingly well, happening on a small but impressive scale. As we run out for the second half, we remain in the game. But success is still far from assured.</p> <p><em>Craig Dearden-Phillips is managing director of </em><a href=\"http://stepping-out.biz/\" title=\"\"><em>Stepping Out Ltd</em></a><em>, a social enterprise which helps public services to become social enterprises.

  "<p>What if the experience of purchasing electronic media was redesigned around making you feel trusted and sincerely appreciated? What if you knew that the lion's share of the money you spent on electronic media went straight to the creator? What if, in short, you knew your honesty would be rewarded with a fair deal for all parties?</p> <p>Of all the ideas from the heady days of internet futurism, none is as fraught as \"price discrimination,\" the practice of charging different rates to different customers for the same product. Price discrimination is a mainstay of the travel industry, where airlines and hotels try all manner of tricks to try and figure out who's willing to pay more and charge them accordingly.</p> <p>For example, travellers who won't endure an overnight Saturday stay are presumed to be travelling on business, charging the ticket to someone else, and therefore less price-sensitive. So itineraries with Saturday stays are often much cheaper than those without.</p> <p>Region-coding on DVDs is a crack at this: the cost of producing a DVD is very low, so the retail price is pretty much arbitrary. The studios thought they could offer goods at one price in rich countries, and a lower price in poor countries, and use region-codes to prevent the flow of cheap versions from the poor world to the rich world. But DVDs actually cost something to produce on a per-unit basis. What about purely digital goods?</p> <p>On the face of it, digital goods are perfect candidates for price discrimination. The marginal cost of distributing a digital good \u2013 an ebook, a game, a video, a song \u2013 is virtually nothing. So the art and science of selling digital goods is figuring out the optimal price, informed not by what your upfront costs are, but what you think the market will bear. With digital goods, the object isn't to make the maximum profit per customer, but to make the maximum profit overall.</p> <p>The 1980s and 1990s were full of stories of \"perfect markets\" where goods could be priced to exactly align with the amount customers are willing to spend. You could sell someone an ebook for a day, then let them upgrade to a weekly licence. You could rent a movie for a low price, rent out the pause button by the second.</p> <p>But with the exception of a few online video-rental services (which offer a time-bound use of a movie) no one seems to want this.</p> <p>People are especially resentful of their neighbours or friends abroad paying radically different prices. And in order to make this kind of limited-use model work, the entertainment industry had to deploy DRM \u2013 software that lurked in the customers' devices, ready to swim to the fore and intone \"I can't let you do that, Dave,\" any time a purchaser wanted to do something outside of the deal they'd been offered.</p> <p>Those deals are viewed as rip-offs, and rightly so. They're a way for big companies to confiscate most of the value that used to come with the price of purchase. A book comes with the right to lend it or give it away, to read it in any chair, under any lightbulb, shelve it on any bookcase, and take it with you to any country.</p> <p>A DRM-crippled ebook comes with arbitrary, ever-shifting limits on lending, reselling and giving away; and is locked to a single platform, effectively giving the store that sold you the book the right to control how you read it.</p> <p>It hasn't escaped the attention of digital customers that they don't need to spend <em>any</em> money to get digital goods.</p> <p>Pirate versions of digital goods are only a few clicks away, and the likelihood of being prosecuted for downloading is about on par with the likelihood of being struck by lightning.</p> <p>What's more, the pirate versions come with <em>no</em> restrictions at all. The inadvertent lesson of price discrimination through DRM is that people who pay more get less.</p> <p>In 2010, a group of independent game developers launched an experiment in voluntary price discrimination. They called it the <a href=\"http://humblebundle.com\" title=\"\">Humble Indie Bundle</a>, and offered a collection of independently produced, DRM-free, Mac/Windows/Linux video games on a \"name your price\" basis.</p> <p>Customers were invited to pay whatever they thought the bundle was worth, and were allowed to come back later and pay more if they reconsidered. They were also given the option of diverting some (or all) of their payment to two named charities: the <a href=\"http://www.eff.org\" title=\"\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://childsplaycharity.org\" title=\"\">Child's Play</a>.</p> <p>The theory behind this pricing model is both honest and sophisticated. Honest, because it is a public display of trust and generosity, a message to customers that says: \"We don't need DRM to keep you honest, and we know you'll pay us what this is worth.\"</p> <p>Sophisticated, because the canny game developers behind Humble introduced all sorts of game-like mechanics to encourage maximum spending, including:</p> <p>\u2022 A public leaderboard, listing the biggest spenders \u2013 some deep-pocketed customers got into a bidding war against each other to maintain pride of place.</p> <p>\u2022 An \"over-the-average\" premium that unlocked access to more games for any purchaser who'd put down a higher-than-average sum \u2013 which meant that the average was being steadily driven up.</p> <p>\u2022 Grouping users into teams by their operating system, and informing them continuously of the relative generosity of Windows, Mac and GNU/Linux users, encouraging platform advocates to stump up more money to prove their side's virtue.</p> <p>It was a tremendous success, garnering more than a million dollars in the first week alone. Humble has heaped triumph upon triumph since, and the most recent Bundle made nearly $5m (\u00a33.1m) in its first week.</p> <p>It turns out that people do the right thing when given the chance; enough, anyway, to offset people who don't give a damn about doing the right thing.</p> <p>Since last spring, I've been volunteering with Humble to curate their first-ever ebook bundle, which launches today, and includes my latest book, Pirate Cinema, a young adult techno-thriller about kids in London who make their own remix movies and show them on hidden screens in cemeteries, squatted pubs, even old sewers (and who end up in hot water with the entertainment industry when word gets out).</p> <p>Almost without exception, the writers I approached for inclusion in the ebook Bundle were enthusiastic about it. However, many of these authors were disappointed to learn that their publishers wouldn't allow them to sell their books without DRM, and had to pull out of the project.</p> <p>But even with those setbacks, I'm delighted with the authors who've come to the Bundle: Kelly Link, Neil Gaiman (with Dave McKean, no less!), Lauren Beukes, John Scalzi, Mercedes Lackey, and a host of others (some will not be revealed before the end of the first week).</p> <p>The charities for this Bundle are the <a href=\"http://www.eff.org\" title=\"\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sfwa.org/benevolent-funds/emergency-medical-fund/\" title=\"\">The Science Fiction Writers of America Emergency Medical Fund</a> (the lack of reliable public healthcare in the US means many writers risk destitution from even minor illnesses and accidents).</p> <p>And we're trying a new price-setting strategy: in addition to the information about how different platforms' users are spending, customers will also get insight into how their city or region ranks in a worldwide league table of relative generosity.</p> <p>We have no idea how this will fare. But the ebook market has been riven by fights over pricing and DRM, and with a roster of brilliant writers and exciting books, I can only hope that readers will follow the example of the gamers before them, and do the right thing.</p>",
  "<p>Should <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/08/april-jones-matthew-woods-jailed\" title=\"\">Matthew Woods</a> have been sentenced to 12 weeks in prison for making \"grossly offensive\" remarks about the missing five-year-old girl April Jones on his Facebook page? While Woods, 19, was pleading guilty to the offence in Chorley magistrates' court on Monday -- and while Mark Bridger, 46, was appearing before Aberystwyth magistrates charged with April's murder -- the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, was sitting round a table with a group of journalists discussing whether people like Woods should face charges in the first place.</p> <p>Starmer made it clear that he had to enforce the law as it was; he couldn't grant immunities. On the other hand, the Crown Prosecution Service, which he heads, couldn't prosecute everyone who sent an offensive tweet or email. So the DPP is in the process of drawing up draft guidelines, which he hopes to circulate for public comment next month.</p> <p>Before that, he is discussing the possible scope of those guidelines in meetings with journalists, lawyers, academics, regulators and key stakeholders.</p> <p>Starmer disclosed his plans last month when announcing that he would not be prosecuting the semi-professional footballer <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_statements/dpp_statement_on_tom_daley_case_and_social_media_prosecutions/\" title=\"\">Daniel Thomas</a> for posting a homophobic message on Twitter about the Olympic divers Tom Daley and Peter Waterfield.</p> <p>The fundamental question Starmer has to decide is how to balance freedom of expression against the restrictions on free speech laid down by parliament.</p> <p>Woods was convicted under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, which makes it an offence to send a \"message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\" using a \"public electronic communications network\". The maximum penalty is six months' imprisonment.</p> <p>His defence lawyer told the court: \"In one moment of drunken stupidity he places himself as public enemy number two \u2013 behind only the person who carried out this crime.\" But should Woods have faced charges at all?</p> <p>Before considering just how offensive a message had to be to qualify as \"grossly\" offensive, the journalists sitting round Starmer's table urged him to set a high threshold for bringing prosecutions under section 127. As the DPP's own officials had noted, it was not the job of the criminal law to protect the public against remarks that were in bad taste or opinions that were controversial. The European court of human rights decided as long ago as 1976 that the right to freedom of expression includes the right to say things or express opinions <a href=\"http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57499\" title=\"\">\"that offend, shock or disturb the state or any sector of the population\"</a>.</p> <p>On the other hand, Starmer thought a message might be more likely to lead to a prosecution if it was part of a campaign of harassment against an individual or individuals; if it was a credible threat to the life of the recipient or the recipient's family; or if it was an incitement to hatred on grounds of gender, race, religion, disability or sexual orientation. Someone who retweeted a message -- particularly if that gave it a much larger circulation -- might also face prosecution.</p> <p>There was some lively discussion about the factors that should make a prosecution less likely. What if the message was meant as a joke, as Woods had apparently claimed his Facebook comments were? That should surely not be a get-out-of-jail card, although we seem to give stand-up comedians and political satire programmes much greater latitude on grounds of racist jokes and bad language. What if a message was not intended to become public or the author did not expect it to be seen by the person he was writing about? That should be no defence if a message was posted on Twitter -- users ought to know by now that a tweet is more like a broadcast than a email -- though it might protect emails themselves.</p> <p>And should the CPS take account of the degree of distress caused to recipients or their families? It was suggested that prosecutors should be wary of attaching too much weight to subjective factors -- although it might be difficult to prove a case without the victim's co-operation.</p> <p>These were no more than points for discussion and may not appear in this form when the draft guidelines are published. But they give some idea of thinking within the CPS. Prosecutors have to exercise their discretion in every charge they bring and it is not always easy to decide where the public interest lies.</p> <p>Should Starmer be influenced by the substantial prison sentence passed on people like Woods -- approaching the maximum, given the one-third discount for an immediate plea of guilty? Or by the strength of public feeling? Woods was apparently arrested for his own safety after about 50 people encircled his home.</p> <p>Less so, I would argue. People who cause needless hurt and offence to bereaved families and their supporters should be censured, shunned and shamed. Prosecution and possible imprisonment should be reserved for those who make credible threats to kill or maim others, putting their victims in genuine fear for their safety.</p> <p>And what of the hapless Woods? He can hardly appeal against conviction, given that he pleaded guilty on the strength of perfectly sound legal advice. On the other hand, an appeal against sentence may stand some prospect of success. It certainly ought to.</p>",
  "<p>The great historian Lewis Mumford once described a patent as \"a device that enables one man to claim special financial rewards for being the last link in the complicated social process that produced the invention\". He was pointing out that we do not produce inventions <em>ex nihilo</em>, but rather draw on the totality of the inventions and knowledge that came before us.</p> <p>It is no longer just the fruits of a centuries-long social process that are targets of patent claims. Through genetic engineering, corporations can now create and patent new life forms. Physicist Vandana Shiva, in a video launching the global <a href=\"http://seedfreedom.in/\" title=\"\">Seed Freedom Campaign</a>, calls this ownership of entire new species a form of slavery, and calls upon farmers and consumers to fight the privatisation of the genetic commons.</p> <p>Could it be that she is being naive? Facing the spectre of world hunger amid continued population growth, maybe we will have to let go of our sentimental attachment to traditional farmers saving seeds, and transition to high-tech agriculture so that we can improve yields per hectare. After all, we cannot clear much more cropland at the expense of forests and wetlands. And to finance the enormous long-term investment necessary to engineer high-yielding, drought-resistant, pest-resistant varieties, don't we need to enforce a strong system of patents?</p> <p>This position seems reasonable, but it is fraught with assumptions that collapse under close scrutiny. First and foremost is the notion that we need chemical pesticides, herbicides and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to feed the hungry. Surely each new innovation brings higher crop yields, right? Surely yields are higher when you kill the bugs than when you don't, higher when you use improved strains than when you don't?</p> <p>Not really. Holding all other variables constant, certainly a large wheat field will produce more if it is treated with chemical herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers. But organic agriculture, and especially permaculture and traditional peasant agriculture, don't hold variables constant at all. Each farming culture adapts over time to the unique characteristics of the local soil, biome and climate. Farmer and land co-evolve over generations. <a href=\"http://www.rodaleinstitute.org/files/GreenRevUP.pdf\" title=\"\">Numerous studies</a> show that when organic agriculture is practised well, it can bring double or triple the yields of conventional techniques. With intensive intercropping on mixed permaculture farms, yields can be <a href=\"http://www.whale.to/a/blume.html\" title=\"\">higher still</a>. It is a myth that mechanised, chemical, GMO agriculture maximises yield per hectare.</p> <p>What it does maximise is productivity per unit of labour, which is a good thing if we uphold American-style economic development as a model for the rest of the world. Taking the essential parameters of large-scale mechanised agriculture as a given, those who argue that we need genetic engineering \u2013 and therefore GMO patenting \u2013 to feed the world's hungry are right. However, these parameters encode assumptions that we are beginning to recognise as diastrous.</p> <p>Western-style agriculture faces a mounting crisis that is insurmountable through the usual application of more control-based technology. Aquifer depletion, salinisation, soil erosion and soil compaction reveal our system as unsustainable. Meanwhile, each technological solution generates unanticipated new problems; for example, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/02/us-usa-study-pesticides-idUSBRE89100X20121002\" title=\"\">herbicide and pesticide resistance</a> (superweeds and superbugs) mean that more technology is needed even to keep yields from declining. GMOs seem to generate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/28/study-gm-maize-cancer\" title=\"\">unpredictable health dangers</a>. And commodifying agricultural inputs like GM seeds and the pesticides and herbicides they are designed to accompany disrupts rural labour reciprocity, promotes indebtedness and creates dependence on volatile international commodity prices.</p> <p>This crisis calls us toward more ecological farming methods that draw from the world's ancient agricultural traditions. These traditions include not only agronomic knowledge, but also social structures that allow that knowledge to evolve and circulate. Today, instead we have an intellectual property system that encourages innovation, yes, but only a certain kind of innovation \u2013 the kind that leads to greater profits.</p> <p>What is the alternative? The ancient practice of seed saving and seed sharing, which allows plants, land, and culture to co-evolve organically, is being revived by organisations like the <a href=\"http://seedsavers.org/\" title=\"\">Seed Savers Exchange</a>. The Seed Freedom movement seeks to preserve this practice, which comes under assault whenever new regulations are proposed to require registration of all seeds to protect the intellectual property rights of patent holders.</p> <p>Over the last two decades, innovative permaculture practices have spread like wildfire, and none of them are patented, made artificially scarce and then sold. Instead they are copied, shared and adapted to local conditions \u2013 much the same way that genes spread through species and life forms spread around the globe.</p> <p>In ecology, each species contributes to the wellbeing of all life and benefits from the wellbeing of all life. Now humanity is rejoining that circle. The next great agricultural transformation will not be an intensification of technologies of extraction and control; it will be an ecological agriculture that regenerates soil, aquifers and biodiversity. Traditional agricultural societies where farmers still save and share seeds are much closer to the ideal of ecological agriculture than the western model. Rather than imposing our technology on the rest of the world, perhaps it is us who can learn from them.</p>",
  "<p>Politics was a dirty business even in the 19th century, and even when changing history for the better, as the best moments of Lincoln wittily and elegantly prove. Steven Spielberg's behemoth of a new film, which premiered in unfinished form at the New York film festival Monday night, has a title that suggests a sweeping portrait of the great 16th American president. But the film is largely too content depicting Abraham Lincoln as an all-knowing icon, and even with Daniel Day-Lewis's beautifully measured (and surprisingly soft-spoken) performance, Lincoln often recedes to the background of the very uneven movie that bears his name.</p> <p>The screenplay from Pulitzer prize-winner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/tony-kushner\" title=\"\">Tony Kushner</a> focuses on just the last four months of Lincoln's life, as he works in Washington to end the civil war raging just south of him, but not before passing an amendment to officially outlaw slavery. The backroom deals and legal hurdles to make that happen are immensely complicated, but after some bulky exposition this wheeling and dealing among lawmakers makes for the film's strongest scenes. Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) hires a trio of hooligans (John Hawkes, Tim Blake Nelson and James Spader) to rustle up votes for the amendment through whatever means necessary, while on the floor of the House of Representatives, anti-slavery lawmaker Thaddeus Stevens (a gloriously scene-stealing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tommyleejones\" title=\"\">Tommy Lee Jones</a>) bellows at pro-slavery Fernando Wood (Lee Pace), with the roomful of men around them banging on their desks and shouting over each other. If only modern American politics were remotely as entertaining.</p> <p>We visit the battlefield a few times, with General Ulysses S Grant (Jared Harris) preparing to negotiate peace with the Confederacy, but Lincoln is largely set in the cramped chambers of the White House and Congress; between that and the many speeches about constitutional law, it can start to feel a little airless. Glimpses into Lincoln's personal life, including strained relationships with both his wife (Sally Field) and eldest son (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/joseph-gordon-levitt\" title=\"\">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a>), are intended to add a human dimension to the president, but they're never as effective as simply seeing the man at work; Gordon-Levitt has had a fantastic year in other films, but his character here is entirely superfluous, and Field brings tremendous overacting to a cast that's otherwise quite restrained.</p> <p>Lincoln isn't as sentimental as you might expect from Spielberg, and though it never digs deep enough into Lincoln as a man, it's unafraid to show him as a canny politician willing to bend the law and make enormous compromises to accomplish a greater goal. With John Williams's gentle score, posh cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and a whole load of big costumes and facial hair for the cast, Lincoln veers too often toward becoming a somnolent period piece, but the strong cast and political texture always manage to perk things back up. Though it might have worked better as a tighter, purely political thriller with even less focus on the title character, Lincoln's smarty-pants pleasures manage to outweigh its stuffy drawbacks.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has given his backing to a referendum on the European Union, saying it is the \"cleanest, neatest and simplest way\" of giving the public a say on Britain's position in Europe.</p> <p>The prime minister firmed up his stance two days after suggesting voters should have the opportunity to give <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/07/david-cameron-mansion-tax-cuts\" title=\"\">\"fresh consent\" to a new settlement on the EU</a>, signalling that the Conservatives intend to include a referendum in their manifesto ahead of the next general election.</p> <p>Cameron made clear that a referendum would not pose the \"in/out\" question sought by many in his party, but would be about changing Britain's position within the EU.</p> <p>His comments came during an interview in which he denied that his leadership was moving the Tories further to the right, insisting, rather, that his party represented \"the common ground of British politics\".</p> <p>Cameron said his preferred option for securing change in the EU was with the backing of the British people.</p> <p>He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"Europe is changing, the eurozone is going to integrate, they are going to do more things together, and I think that's right for them. It's necessary if they are going to save the single currency, but I think that does open up the opportunity for Britain to get a fresh and a better settlement with Europe and I am committed to making sure we do everything to set that out in the runup to the next election; to get that fresh settlement then seek fresh consent for that settlement.</p> <p>\"And why I've always opposed the straight in/out referendum is that I'm neither in favour of out \u2013 leaving altogether \u2013 nor am I satisfied with the status quo. I want to change the status quo. We've always said that when we've achieved that fresh settlement, it needs consent, either at a referendum or a general election. Frankly, a referendum is obviously the cleanest, neatest and simplest, most sensible way of doing that. But as I say, it's right to leave open the question for the time being.\"</p> <p>Cameron defended tough measures being considered to reduce the deficit, as he made clear the government would plough on with its austerity programme, insisting Britain did not need a 'Plan B' despite concerns expressed by the <a href=\"Fund.http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/09/austerity-continues-david-cameron-imf-warning\" title=\"\">International Monetary Fund</a>.</p> <p>Pressed on the fact that the government's strategy did not appear to be working amid a battery of grim figures, including weak economic growth, Cameron insisted the Conservatives were answering the \"big questions\" on how Britain succeeded in a global race, unlike other political parties. \"I think people understand we are taking responsibility.\"</p> <p>He denied that a pledge to ensure those on higher incomes paid their fair share remained vague, in contrast to plans being worked up to find \u00a310bn of further cuts in welfare benefits.</p> <p>\"In every budget we've made sure the richest have made a proper contribution,\" he said, \"\u2026 we've made sure that we are all in this together and the richest do make their contributions and we will go on doing that. You would not expect me to make budget measures here on your programme.\"</p> <p>The prime minister was doing a round of interviews as the Tories prepared to announce that householders who used physical force to deter burglars would be given greater protection from the law. The move shows the new justice secretary, Chris Grayling, is abandoning the legacy of his predecessor, Kenneth Clarke.</p> <p>It emerged in a separate interview that Cameron had himself been burgled twice while living in north Kensington, London.</p> <p>Asked if he would be \"a fight or a flight\" person, Cameron told Sky: \"I think you never know what is going to happen in those circumstances and I'm not advising people to have a go, but the fact is people need the certainty that if they were in that situation and they did have to take action to defend themselves then the law is on their side.\"</p> <p>Cameron denied his party was \"turning right\" to grab back the \"one nation\" mantle appropriated by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in his party conference speech last week.</p> <p>\"The Labour party cannot be a one nation party because, if you read or listen to Ed Miliband's speech, he was, of course, signalling he was turning to the right but actually in everything he said he was turning to the left \u2013 a tax on wealth creation, a tax on business, a tax on success.</p> <p>\"You can't preach one nation and practise class war.</p> <p>\"I think everybody sees that. The common ground of British politics right now is answering the question on everybody's lips \u2013 how do we take action to get Britain out of the difficulties we are in today?\"</p> <p>He added: \"The Conservative party is doing what I would say all of the country would want to see, which is to unlock the talent of everyone to make sure we win in this global race. That's not leftwing or rightwing, it's sensible common ground, common sense, practical Conservative thinking.\"</p> <p>The prime minister was celebrating his 46th birthday as delegates prepared to gather for the third day of their party conference, with the London mayor, Boris Johnson, taking top billing when he gives a keynote speech on Tuesday morning. His star is firmly in the ascendancy amid widespread speculation that he may pursue the party leadership further down the line.</p> <p>Asked what Johnson could get him for his birthday, Cameron said: \"He's giving me a relatively light day, which is good of him. The point is, we are lucky in the Conservative party to have some big and popular figures to take the message out across the country as well as having someone who is a first class mayor of London.\"</p> <p>Asked if Johnson might be sent abroad following his time as mayor, the prime minister quipped: \"I'm not sure which country deserves him the most but I will take that one away and think about it.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Kevin Keegan returned from Hamburg in 1980 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVLJsxyIX-o\">he captured his love of England in song</a>. Over simple acoustic strumming \u2013&#xa0;think Mull of Kintyre with a higher tempo and fewer bagpipes \u2013 he sang: \"Oh how I yearn to be home again... we'll sit by the fireside and sing, we'll walk down a country lane on Sunday morning.\" </p> <p>Keegan has always been a patriot, but his romanticised view of England has not always caught the imagination of those around him. His paean to the nation failed to chart and he ended his international career on a Wembley toilet.</p> <p>Keegan resigned from the role of England manager 12 years ago this week. His team had played poorly at Euro 2000 and were then beaten at home to Germany in the last game at the old Wembley. They lost to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTlmD8oIzt8\">a single Dietmar Hamman goal</a> \u2013&#xa0;a free-kick from well outside the box that should have been saved by David Seaman.</p> <p>David Davies tells the story of what happened after the match in his diary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/aug/01/fa-confidential-david-davies-review\">FA Confidential</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The old Wembley closed down in humiliation. Even the heavens wept for England. But no one at the FA could have predicted what happened next. On entering the dressing room, I couldn't believe the scene. Steam poured out of the showers, making it difficult to see who was where, but I glimpsed Kevin in one corner. Tony Adams, David Beckham and other players sat around in various states of undress.</p> <p>'David, you tell him not to do it,' shouted Tony, who was completely fired up. <br>'David, he'll listen to you,' pleaded Becks, who was in tears. <br>'What?' <br>'Talk to him,' Tony said. <br>'Who?' <br>'Kevin!' Tony and David both yelled. <br>They didn't need to tell me what Kevin had done. He'd thrown in the towel. I knew it. I looked at Kevin. </p> <p>'Don't leave. You have to stay.' <br>'No, no, no,' Kevin replied. 'I'm off. I'm not for this.' <br>'This isn't happening,' I thought. I wasn't prepared mentally for such a situation. Think fast. Calm things down. Lock away the emotions. Shift into work mode. <br>'Come on, let's go,' said Kevin, 'I'm ready to face the press.' <br>'No, you're bloody not. We're having a talk before you go anywhere near the press.' </p> <p>Where on earth could we find that was private? The tunnel? Crawling with television reporters. The dressing room? Heaving with emotional players. The bath area? I couldn't hold a vital conversation with an England manager as players dived into the water. Only one option presented itself. The toilet cubicles. A dramatic moment in England's long football history occurred in the ancient loos of a stadium facing demolition. The impending destruction could almost be smelled in the air. </p> <p>Dragging Kevin into a cubicle, I shut the door behind us. We stood there, facing each other. 'You can't change my mind,' Kevin said. 'I'm out of here. I'm not up to it. I'm going out to the press to tell them I'm not up to it. I can't motivate the players. I can't get the extra bit out of these players that I need.' </p> </blockquote> <h2>King Kevin abdicates again: Where now for England?</h2> <p><em>David Lacey, writing a few days after Keegan's resignation, summed up the predicament facing the FA:</em></p> <p>Of the 10 men who have been in charge of the England football team over the past 54 years, Kevin Keegan will be remembered as a cheerleader who denied Wembley one last hurrah and then quit while he was behind. Keegan's sudden resignation five minutes after his team had lost Saturday's World Cup qualifier 1-0 to Germany concludes the most bizarre period yet in the quirky history of national managers.</p> <p>The England coach had taken over 20 months ago after the Football Association's decision to sack Glenn Hoddle once the prime minister, put on the spot in a day-time television chat show, had muttered that if Hoddle really had implied the disabled were paying for the sins of past lives he ought to go. In view of what has happened now Hoddle might have been referring to the FA international committee, for if ever a body is reaping the whirlwind of past misdeeds it is surely this one.</p> <p>Bobby Robson took England to the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup but his contract was not renewed, Terry Venables had already decided not to sign a fresh contract by the time England reached the last four of Euro 96, the committee having expressed doubts about his legal wrangles with Alan Sugar and the Department of Trade and Industry, and Hoddle's sin was to express his beliefs clumsily to a national newspaper.</p> <p>The timing of Keegan's departure was totally predictable. His temperament and lack of tactical nous made him a bad choice from the start. When he originally agreed to take the job for four matches, while remaining manager of Fulham, he promised that the players would sing the national anthem with passion and bring a similar mood to their performances. Well, not all of the team were singing before Saturday's match and not enough of them were in harmony during the game to form a barbershop quartet.</p> <p>Keegan also stressed that he would not leave Fulham once his four-match stint had ended. After two games in charge, however, he decided that \"it's time to stop playing games: I want the job\". On Saturday he again decided it was time to stop playing games, only now he believed he was not up to the job after all. In other words, after taking the England post saying I'm sorry I'll read that again, he has abandoned it admitting I'm sorry I haven't a clue.</p> <p>Keegan's plea of mea culpa \u2013 \"I'm blaming nobody but myself. I wasn't good enough\" \u2013 the revelation that during England's awful first half that he did not know what to do, his apparent self-sacrifice in order to hand the squad over to someone with more knowledge and the hardly original thought that he wants to spend more time with his family will cut little ice with experienced Kev-watchers.</p> <p>He has walked out after a defeat that made it imperative that he stayed for at least four more days in order to give England the best chance of repairing the damage, serious though hardly mortal, to their chances of qualifying for the World Cup caused by an initial home defeat. Instead of which Howard Wilkinson, the FA's technical director, will again pop up like George, the inflatable automatic pilot in Airplane, to take over the team for Wednesday's qualifier in Finland.</p> <p>When Don Revie quit on England during a World Cup qualifying campaign the FA tried, unsuccessfully, to ban him from football for 10 years. True, Keegan did not conduct covert negotiations with the United Arab Emirates before giving his resignation exclusively to a newspaper, but his defection is scarcely more admirable.</p> <p>If, as he insists, he enjoyed the full support of everybody at the FA from the chairman to the Lancaster Gate cat then surely he could have given the job one more chance.</p> <p>Keegan's excuse that the fans who clamoured successfully for his appointment had helped him make up his mind on Saturday by booing him as he left the arena is barely worth consideration. If every England manager had walked out after being jeered at Wembley Alf Ramsey, Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson, Graham Taylor and Glenn Hoddle would not have lasted anywhere near as long as they did.</p> <p>According to Adam Crozier, the FA's chief executive who has limited experience of these things: \"It is never easy to say I'm not going to be England coach any more. To walk away from that is a very courageous thing to do.\" Yet surely it would have been even more courageous to stay put, tough it out, and risk the probability of being ditched by the FA if the team also lost in Helsinki.</p> <p>It is not as if Keegan had a rough ride from the media, who let him down relatively lightly after the debacle of Euro 2000. He was never vilified in the press as Robson was more than once. He was never lampooned as cruelly as Taylor nor hung out to dry like Hoddle. The heat in Keegan's kitchen barely rose above gas mark one.</p> <p>Crozier was nearer the mark, albeit unwittingly,when he observed that \"I think Kevin Keegan knew he was making the right decision for Kevin Keegan \". That is surely the point.</p> <p>On Saturday Keegan made all the right self-deprecatory noises in the interviews. He is a master of the soundbite and it is a pity that his tactical know-how in handling reporters' questions was not matched by an ability to organise the England team.</p> <p>\"I just feel that for Kevin Keegan there is nothing more in football I want to do,\" he said a trifle wistfully. Presumably this precludes returning to TV as a soccer pundit. Surely he can never sit in judgment on England again having admitted that he did not know enough when he was in charge.</p> <h2>The aftermath</h2> <p>Tony Banks, the former Sports Minister who led England's failed bid for the 2006 World Cup, blamed \"half-arsed journalists\" and the \"self-appointed experts\" in the crowd who had jeered Keegan. But the manager admitted he had not been up to the job: \"I just don't feel I can find that little bit extra you need at this level to find a winning formula. I just feel I have given it my best shot. I don't want to outstay my welcome.\"</p> <p>Keegan later admitted that he had not enjoyed his time as England manager: \"I found it soulless. I found it hard to fill in the time. I found myself going and training the blind team, the deaf team, working with the ladies team. It's a very difficult job.\"</p> <h2>The replacement</h2> <p>When it came to replacing Keegan, there was a dearth of English candidates. Peter Taylor took over the job as caretaker for a single defeat to Italy, but was never really in contention. In a typical bout of doublespeak, Harry Redknapp distanced himself from the position: \"I cannot think of a worse job. Whoever takes it, three or four months down the line will be getting abused. The simple truth is, no matter what side you pick, we don't seem to look good enough. I cannot think of a worse job.\"</p> <p>Terry Venables wasn't optimistic about his chances: \"It's well documented that the FA didn't want to go back before Kevin took the job, which meant going back to me, so I think that rules me out.\"</p> <p>Writing in the Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2000/oct/27/sport.comment\">Ron Atkinson decried Roy Hodgson's chances</a>: \"I don't want to decry Roy because he has worked very hard to get where he is, but we are talking about the England national job here. Someone who has been as successful as him in Switzerland is Christian Gross, but would anybody be touting him as Kevin Keegan 's successor?\" </p> <p>Howard Wilkinson was given this assessment by one Guardian writer: \"Motivational skills: None, unless you are a believer in gobbledegook. Tactical awareness: Great if you like the ball hoofed higher than a sponsor's blimp. Temperament: Drone, drone, drone (think William Hague). Verdict: Would be totally outclassed.\"</p> <p>When the merits of foreign coaches were condsidered, the Guardian leader warned applicants to be wary of the Sun. Perhaps Sven G\u00f6ran-Eriksson would have preferred a heads-up about their sister paper, the News of the World:</p> <blockquote> <p>To judge from the views which have poured into websites, most fans believe there are only two options for filling the vacancy. First: Terry Venables second: someone else. Someone else, this time, might not be English. One ingenious pundit says the FA should go back to Fulham, where they found Mr Keegan, and hire his French successor, Jean Tigana. </p> <p>Stuffy old cricket dared to do it, engaging the Zimbabwean Duncan Fletcher, and last season's performance suggests it may have paid off. Yet any foreign import who takes the job will need to be a stupendous success, since otherwise the sort of obloquy which came the way of Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle and others will break out all over again, but this time with added xenophobia. Even the Sun, contenders should be aware, knows the French for \"turnip\".</p> </blockquote> <p>In the end, Sven Goran-Eriksson took the job and became the first foreigner to manage England. He is now the technical director of BEC Tero Sasana FC in Bangkok, Thailand. Contrary to the reasoning of David Lacey, Keegan is now a pundit. He can be found delivering <a href=\"http://expertfootball.com/gossip/quotes.php?search=Kevin_Keegan\">\"Keeganisms\"</a> on ESPN and even made his way back to ITV, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zRUM4ohx20&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=130s\">the scene of his most foolish prediction</a>, for the World Cup in 2010. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXpUdBlRZe8\"> interview in which Keegan said he would \"love it\" if Newcastle beat Manchester United</a> to the Premier League title was voted the most memorable quote in Premier League history.</p> <h2>Share your memories of the Keegan era below</h2>",
  "<p>Victims of antisocial behaviour are to decide how offenders are punished under a \"community remedy\" power to be detailed by Theresa May in a speech at the Conservative party conference.</p> <p>The home secretary will say on Tuesday that she wants to change the law to empower victims to ensure they get some form of reparation by choosing from a \"menu\" of punishment options that would include a form of restorative justice.</p> <p>She hopes the measure will help boost the introduction of police and crime commissioners when the first elections take place on 15 November.</p> <p>In her speech, May is expected to respond to the delays of up to 14 years in extraditing terrorism suspects, such as Abu Hamza, by announcing her own a review of how the Human Rights Act can be replaced by a British bill of rights and responsibilities. This is likely to clash with the coalition's existing commission on a bill of rights that is not expected to recommend scrapping the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>The home secretary is also expected to outline her intention to opt out of areas of EU police and justice co-operation, including possibly the European arrest warrant.</p> <p>May will confirm her target of cutting net migration from 210,000 to \"tens of thousands\" by the time of the next election.</p> <p>The home secretary told the Daily Mail the \"community remedy\" would be used for low-level crime, such as criminal damage, which would normally be dealt with by a caution. Last year, 272,000 cautions were handed out for such antisocial behaviour. The police and crime commissioners will decide what \"menu\" of punishments should be available for victims to choose from.</p> <p>An offender who refused to accept the punishment would face court proceedings as an alternative.</p> <p>\"One of the big problems for the victims of antisocial behaviour is that they feel powerless,\" May told the newspaper. \"Somebody does something to them or their property and they feel they don't get reparation, or feel they are not part of the process.</p> <p>\"We want to ensure that they have a choice. It will mean saying to the victim: 'Here's a list of options, what do you want to do?' They may choose to go down the restorative route, and that they want someone to say sorry.</p> <p>\"It may be that they want reparation for the damage that was done, so if a window has been broken they want it fixed. It may be that they want an offender to do something not immediately in relation to them, but for the community,\" she said.</p> <p>The home secretary's intention to opt out of some areas of European policing and judicial co-operation has attracted strong criticism from senior police leaders and the Liberal Democrats. May is expected to indicate that at the very least the UK will opt out of EU police and justice co-operation when the decision has to be made in 2014. This will be packaged up as part of the UK repatriating powers from Europe.</p> <p>The European arrest warrant is seen by police and intelligence officers as one of the most successful instruments in European crime-fighting, helping speed up extraditions and the process of bringing to justice some of Europe's most wanted criminals. If the UK opts out of all police and justice co-operation it can selectively opt back in to some of it at a later stage, provided other countries do so.</p>",
  "<p>The numbers around how many people use social media are staggering \u2013 91% of global adults online use social media regularly. In the UK there are 41 million Facebook users and 10 million people on Twitter. As you're reading this article online, it means you'll probably check at least one social media site today. There is no denying the power of it, and it's changed the way we communicate.</p> <p>Despite how ubiquitous social media is, not everyone has figured out how to translate available online tools into offline goals. This includes charities and social enterprises, who, despite their interest and enthusiasm, may not be social media savvy just yet.</p> <p>In partnership with <a href=\"http://www.unity.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Unity Trust Bank</a>, <a href=\"http://www.socialmisfitsmedia.com/\" title=\"\">Social Misfits Media</a> have, this week, launched our plan to address that issue. About that First Tweet is a practical guide to social media, aimed at small to medium-sized charities and social enterprises and is free to download <a href=\"http://www.unity.co.uk/guide\" title=\"\">free to download here</a>.</p> <p>The guide features interviews from experts on the main social media platforms, inspirational case studies from organisations who have run successful social media campaigns, resources and other tools to help even the leanest organisations become Twitterphiles in no time at all.</p> <p>To ensure the guide was addressing the needs of the organisations we were seeking to support \u2013 UK-based charities and social enterprises with an annual turnover of less than \u00a35m \u2013 we conducted original research, surveying 186 such organisations on their social media habits, usage, and frustrations.</p> <p>Many of the results were surprising. For example, we originally conceived the guide as a tool to help organisations get started on social media. But our research actually showed that more than 70% of the organisations were already using Facebook, Twitter, or both. LinkedIn and YouTube were also popular, with more than a third of respondents having already created accounts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397422513\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/08/Social-media-chart-1.gif\" alt=\"Social media chart 1\" width=\"460\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Once probed, we uncovered that although these organisations may already boast a social media presence, they're not always sure of what to do with it. When asked if they felt that their social media was integrated into not just a communications strategy, but a fundraising strategy, 53% responded that their social media strategy was not very integrated or not at all integrated. \"Our social media strategy and fundraising strategy are entirely separate,\" one respondent from a medium-sized charity told us. \"We haven't yet explored any ways to join them.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397422514\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/08/Social-media-chart-2.gif\" alt=\"Social media chart 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"621\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The other main issue reported by many respondents was the lack of time to devote to social media: 75% only receive occasional support to update their platforms, when someone has a bit of spare time (and how often does that actually happen in the third sector?).</p> <p>The guide takes all this on board and provides practical tips and strategies that organisations can start doing right now. A few of our favourite tips:</p> <p>\u2022 Don't feel you need to be everywhere at all times. Jaimie Popp, social media strategist at the <a href=\"http://nikeinc.com/pages/the-nike-foundation/\" title=\"\">Nike Foundation</a> who features in the case study on <a href=\"http://www.girleffect.org/learn/faq\" title=\"\">The Girl Effect</a>, recommends being selective with the platforms you choose: \"By starting with your audience, you can put your momentum where it needs to be,\" he says.</p> <p>\u2022 Let users help you create content. You don't need to post everything yourself. Libby Leffler, strategic partner manager at Facebook, recommends things like photo competitions and polls to get your followers to submit their own content; not only is it compelling but it saves you time too.</p> <p>\u2022 Start making friends. Meg Garlinghouse, head of social impact at LinkedIn, says their research has shown that people can begin to take advantage of their second and third degree networks once they have 30 LinkedIn connections.</p> <p>\u2022 Use your mobile. By downloading free apps for things like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn on your smart phone, you can post photos and information on the go.</p> <p>\u2022 Or better yet, get professionals to do it for free. The New York Public Library got a local improvised comedy group with a big YouTube following to act in a viral video for free \u2013 just by asking.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unity.co.uk/guide\" title=\"\">Download About that First Tweet</a> for many more insights and ideas.</p> <p><em>Carlos Miranda is the founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.socialmisfitsmedia.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Social Misfits Media</em></a><em>, a social media strategy firm and sister company of IG Advisors, a philanthropy and fundraising consultancy.

  "<p>It's rare for a boardroom scene in The Apprentice to pass without Lord Sugar reminding the contestants how he started with nothing. But that was then ... can the same success be replicated in today's business climate?</p> <p>Davinia Parker is 10 months into a new venture, <a href=\"http://www.harboursidehandbags.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harbourside</a> \u2013 an online boutique and wholesaler of affordable, high quality leather handbags which she designs herself. Like many entrepreneurs, Parker's vision came from a personal interest \u2013 she appreciated designer handbags for their quality, but balked at the associated \u00a3800+ price tag. Harbourside's products retail for \u00a360-\u00a3120; the leather is imported from Italy and the goods are made in the Far East.</p> <p>Keen not to be indebted to anyone, Parker has funded the business herself. Working from home, she introduces a new collection each season to avoid over-stocking. With a background in PR, she doesn't have far to look for promotional expertise; for other services she tries to avoid paying for something if she can find scope for a skills swap.</p> <p>She seized one such opportunity with a contact she made at a recent retail conference. \"She was selling carpet bags but was struggling to get exposure,\" Parker says. \"I offered to promote her products as a guest label on my website, which already had good traction. She achieved more sales without the cost of having to host her own website or use pay-per-click advertising, while I got to broaden my product line without incurring additional risk.\"</p> <p>Another tactic is volunteering to speak at conferences, rather than forking out what might be \u00a31,400+ (plus travel and equipment/artwork) for a small tucked-away stand at an exhibition. Parker has also shunned offers of formal focus groups. \"Rather than pay an arbitrary group of people to comment on my stock, I use my existing networks and host my own consumer panels,\" she explains.</p> <p>She doesn't employ anyone, does the books herself and only seeks professional help for the odd query \u2013 such as validating what she's doing with an accountant employed by someone else in the family.</p> <p>For Jonathan Meare, founder of jdmdesigns in Poynton, Cheshire, external input has played a more critical role, particularly in helping identify potential grant-funding. Three years ago Meare was a senior buyer in the construction industry. Having taken voluntary redundancy out of fear for the sector's prospects, he had a eureka moment during a beach holiday and decided to pursue his dream of being an inventor. His product is a simple clip that <a href=\"http://www.thebeachtowelclip.com/\" title=\"\">stops a beach towel blowing away</a>. Today it is stocked in more than 20 countries.</p> <p>Development company Lucid Group put him on to the North West Development Agency (NWDA) which was offering \u00a3300 'innovation vouchers'. This helped him get started on development.</p> <p>The next challenge was getting publicity. Meare joined the <a href=\"http://www.manchesterinventors.com/\" title=\"\">Manchester Inventors Group</a> and learned that by blogging and tweeting about the product himself he could reach a decent audience for free.</p> <p>Further help came from Business Link and UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI). The latter provided match-funding through its passport to export scheme which supports home-grown products (the beach towel clip is made entirely in the UK); Meare entered the Australian market in December 2010. But can he pay the mortgage? \"I'm doing all right \u2013 and my wife works,\" he laughs. \"I haven't had to sell a kidney yet.\"</p> <p>The final contender for success on a shoestring is Luke Aikman, founder and chief executive of <a href=\"https://loccit.com/\" title=\"\">Loccit.com</a>. Still his twenties and already with one company to his name, he is about to launch a new online platform that blends the premise of a private blog with the collective memories created on sites like Facebook.</p> <p>\"From sleeping under my desk, to contra deals, to providing equity rather than money, I've had to do it all,\" Aikman says. A self-confessed \"nightmare student\" at Bristol University six to seven years ago, he introduced himself to the campus's \"head of entrepreneurship\", looking for work to support him as he developed his own inventions. (He was working on a new brand of condom at the time.)</p> <p>As his ambitions grew, Aikman became creative in preserving resources. He began brokering deals between two groups of people he found himself regularly in contact with: computer science students who would happily offer up their development skills in return for slightly more than they'd get pulling pints and people looking for funds to create new digital or mobile apps. Through his matchmaking endeavours Aikman was able to turn a tidy profit \u2013 if only he could lay his hands on it.</p> <p>\"The trouble with a project-based business is the cashflow,\" he recalls. With another idea of his own rapidly taking shape, he needed more ready resources. He stopped renting his flat, bought a blow-up mattress and took to sleeping in the university offices, getting up at 5.30am before the cleaners arrived. Discovering that a favourite restaurant had a weak web presence, Aikman volunteered his student team to produce something more professional. He took his cut in the form of three free meals a week, living like this for more than nine months. The resulting company, Nudge Digital, is now self-sufficient.</p> <p>Although his latest business Loccit.com, was founded in less extreme circumstances, again Aikman downsized to save money, this time swapping a nice apartment for a \u00a3230-a-month crash pad in a tower block. He started by employing interns and paying people in equity rather than cash. Within nine months of creating the company he was rewarded for his bootstrapped beginnings, attracting investment from a syndicate of business angels in London.</p> <p>Reflecting on his experiences, Aikman muses, \"Cash is important, but it's not the be-all and end-all.\" But launch quickly, he advises. \"Bring out a minimum viable product so you can start building a customer base, get feedback and create a buzz around what you're doing. It's competitive getting funding, yes, but for great ideas there's always money.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

We believe that the defamation bill will address this in part by tackling libel tourism, where foreign claimants have brought libel actions to the English courts against defendants who are neither British nor resident in this country.</p> <p>However, the bill as it stands would not have prevented any of the libel cases that we have seen over the last few years against journalists, scientists, doctors and activists who have spoken out on issues that are in the public interest.</p> <p>We call on the government to include a strong public interest defence in the defamation bill to allow free and open debate in the UK and abroad.</p> <p>In addition, restrictions must be placed on corporations to limit their ability to use libel law to bully and silence their critics.</p> <p>The UN human rights committee has warned that unduly restrictive libel law in the UK could have a negative impact on the right to freedom of expression worldwide. </p> <p>We believe it is of the utmost importance that the government delivers reform that protects freedom of speech both in the UK and abroad.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Among the signatories are three of the most forceful campaigners for libel law reform: Kirsty Hughes of Index on Censorship; Jo Glanville of English PEN; and Tracey Brown of Sense About Science.</p> <p>Today, the defamation bill has its second reading in the Lords. </p> <p><em>Sources:</em> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/oct/08/promises-libel-law-reform-kept\">The Guardian</a>/<a href=\"http://www.ifex.org/united_kingdom/2012/10/08/reform_libel_law/\">IFEX</a></p>",
  "<p>The decision to pursue exporting and overseas markets doesn't necessarily have to be one that a business makes during its first few years of development. It can often be the case that a solid and established base creates the right setting for expansion \u2013 though when opportunity comes calling it pays dividends for any business to be prepared.</p> <p>Macclesfield-based Plastic Card Services (PCS) was established by Rob Nicholls and Tim Holt in 1993 and has evolved to become a respected manufacturer of plastic cards and associated services. The company's business doesn't involve just bank and credit cards, but also store cards, loyalty cards, ID cards and even hotel key cards. With these types of products there seems little reason for the scope of the business to stay purely within a UK setup. However, it was not until 2010 that the company decided to look at European markets as a way of growing its business. Success has been relatively rapid for the firm \u2013 which currently employs 55 people \u2013 with exports in 2011-12 representing almost 10% of its turnover. This year the company has also won the British Printing Industries Federation's company of the year award.</p> <p>Sales director Adam Unsworth explains that it took finding the right kind of business partnership before the company felt confident about its overseas plans. \"Exporting and looking at foreign markets was something we were actively seeking to achieve. We knew we wanted to do it, and it was great that we got to make the business contacts we did with LogoCard,\" he says. &#xa0;</p> <p>PCS's partnership with LogoCard, a Danish company, was the result of contact from its founder and CEO, Mette Christian Jacobsen. Jacobsen had spotted a gap in the Danish market for loyalty cards and began looking for UK companies with the idea of working together. Unsworth says that Jacobsen's call came at the perfect moment: \"We were proactive because we had been waiting for the right kind of opportunity. We'd been to a lot of UKTI [UK Trade and Investment] events and we were already working towards export. So we jumped at the chance.\"</p> <p>Where Unsworth feels that PCS has seen added benefit from this partnership is in having a representative local to the Scandinavian countries that it is in business with. \"The success we've had in Scandinavia has been helped dramatically by the relationship with LogoCard and with Mette [Jacobsen] in particular. She is well connected, speaks the language, and knows how to do business. The internet may have made the business world smaller but I think when you're serious about export then it really helps to have a representative on the ground in that territory,\" he says.</p> <p>As well as the UKTI events that PCS has attended, Unsworth believes that the trade body has been able to offer support to his company with the information it has provided. He says: \"The UKTI has been very helpful. You get introductions to possible contacts in a particular region but, moreover, the UKTI conducts market research for you. If you wanted to look at exporting to France, which is a territory where we are looking at the moment, it will investigate the area to see if there is any value in you going there. It is a lot of effort in the early stages but it's well worth it in the long run.\"</p> <p>While UK firms may have worries about overseas expansion, such as the amount of regulation, red tape, the process of developing trust, or even the spectre of bribery, Unsworth is full of praise for the working relationship PCS has developed in Scandinavian countries. \"With exporting it is really a case of getting used to a different approach, culture or etiquette. Denmark is a great country to work with. They're good, ethical people to do business with.\"</p> <p>When asked about problems PCS may have faced in building up its export portfolio, Unsworth retains his positive overview but does suggest advice he thinks UK firms should take on board before committing to deals. \"The one aspect I would mention is currency exchange. It was something we learned the hard way. It's very important to get currency exchange agreed at the outset because it changes an awful lot, particularly in that [Scandinavian] region.</p> <p>\"We've seen the rate of exchange experience major fluctuation. It might be a case of fixing the rate of exchange or even agreeing to invoicing in GBP, but it's a major factor. It's something that you've got to really focus on.\"</p> <p>PCS's export progress has reinforced its belief that product innovation is an area that requires consistent attention. The company has found that environmental responsibility is a key purchasing driver in the Scandinavian territories it has worked hard to achieve success in. PCS was the first UK card manufacturer to produce a bioPVC card, which is designed to compost in around three years and it uses a waterless print process in the development of its products, which can significantly reduce harmful emissions. </p> <p>Last year the company undertook a complete overhaul of its website, in part to reflect its export business. Unsworth confirms that the redesign will ultimately deliver an even better experience with \"a complete site, so that anybody who comes to plasticcardservices.co.uk can select their language and go to a local representative who can speak their language\". &#xa0;</p> <p>And for businesses looking to explore social media networks in their hunt of overseas options he is keen to suggest LinkedIn as the site PCS has had success with. For Unsworth this has been particularly evident in the way that LinkedIn has allowed his firm to make contact with potential export partners, especially in relation to bypassing what he calls \"the gatekeepers\" who may withhold access to top-level management. </p> <p>\"With LinkedIn we've found that people have been more responsive, certainly when you're approaching a company for the first time. It's very professional and the other company can check out your profile first. And that works both ways. For us it's been a real big thing over the last 12 months.\"</p> <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.plastic-card-services.co.uk/\">www.plastic-card-services.co.uk</a></p> <p><em>There are three more categories of our Best Practice Exchange competition to enter on a rolling basis - Exporting, Cashflow and Starting Up.

  "<p>When the safety and security of employees and property lies at the core of your business, reputation becomes an important factor in maintaining your success. And while being in business for over 25 years is a measure of progress, for Newson Gale's managing director Graham Tyers there is never a case for resting on your laurels. </p> <p>The company, which is based in Colwick, Nottinghamshire, is a manufacturer of static earthing and bonding equipment and its products assist those in the chemical processing industries to control their exposure to fires and explosions caused by electrostatic discharge in hazardous areas. For Tyers it isn't just product excellence that concerns him but also the perception of his company by customers, and their experience in dealing with him and his colleagues. </p> <p>\"It's only when customers see the level of service and the integrity you show in dealing with them that they really get an idea of who you are. That's the moment of truth: when they make their first interaction with you, whether it's an initial phone call or placing an order, you've got to be on your game.\"</p> <p>It is an approach that has reaped dividends in the UK and further afield with customers in Europe, North America and Asia now representing 75% of the company's turnover. It has also led to the registering of Newson Gale's own trading division in Germany. </p> <p>The route to this overseas development is, in part, due to a European Union success story. Tyers explains that in the early 1990s an EU directive harmonised many electrical safety requirements across Europe. \"Almost overnight, we went from a situation where if we had wanted to sell a product in Germany we would have needed a separate German approval for it \u2013 to a situation where we had a level playing field. If a product was certified in the EU then you could sell to any European state. There were no barriers anymore,\" he says.</p> <p>The company became aware that rather than having just the UK to aim at there was now a European market of over 450 million people, and all the potential that it entailed. However, Tyers says that while EU harmonisation made business more straightforward, refining its export strategy required planning, in terms of staffing, website development and support from trade and industry organisations.</p> <p>Newson Gale has 32 employees, some of whom speak German. When it comes to recruitment, as well as having potential language skills, Tyers says the firm is keen to find staff with an open mind to overseas business. \"We're always looking to find people with the right experience and background and who are able to work across different cultural landscapes. That's definitely been part of our recruitment strategy. It's not happened by accident, it has been worked on,\" he says.</p> <p>As with many firms looking to actively engage with overseas markets, the internet has become a powerful tool for Newson Gale. Tyers regards it as \"the conduit through which all our marketing flows\". The site features multi-language pages and region-specific content. Click on a nation's flag on the site and it will take you to pages in Chinese, French, German, Italian or Spanish, as well as having links to pages for customers from the US and Canada. </p> <p>Tyers stresses that while the company's products (and sales) are key, the website also enables it to provide what he describes as content marketing, something he feels adds an extra service for potential and existing customers. </p> <p>\"We operate in a technical field so we produce white papers, how-to guides and handbooks, which we advertise on the website. Through these we gain awareness, and customers start looking into what we've got to offer with regard to product solutions. It's a powerful way of gaining contacts and winning new business, rather than just advertising the products for their own sake.\"</p> <p>While the immediacy of social media means that Facebook and Twitter remain platforms Newson Gale is willing to explore at some stage, Tyers says the company has benefited from using more professional-orientated networks, such as LinkedIn. \"We've been trying to step up our efforts in terms of social media. But what we currently do is to keep with what's appropriate for us in terms of letting clients know what technical information, guides and white papers are available. We use LinkedIn, with its groups of professionals, as opposed to blatantly trying to push our products, or ourselves, in an aggressive way,\" he says.</p> <p>In the 1990s Newson Gale was buoyed by the encouragement of Business Link and its support for companies looking to expand in the UK and wider markets, and even from Nottinghamshire county council. The latter provided advice on moving into markets such as Poland \u2013 prior to its entry into the EU in 2004 \u2013 and through local town twinning arrangements Newson Gale was able to participate in exhibitions and trade events, which put the company in contact with potential agents and distributors.</p> <p>The company is an active member of the East Midlands International Trade Organisation (Emita) and receives support from the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce. Tyers finds the firm's involvement with these groups refreshing, partly due to the opportunities they provide to talk with like-minded people about issues, problems, and successes. \"You rub shoulders with people in similar positions, and you can learn from each other's mistakes; find out quick tips, and how best to do things. It doesn't necessarily alter the strategy of where you want to go, but it's good that you don't feel you're the only one doing it \u2013 or that you're liable to make expensive mistakes.\" </p> <p>Tyers believes that many UK firms can experience the same overseas expansion as Newson Gale and his advice is two-fold: make sure you know what your competitors \u2013 and their websites \u2013 represent, and don't expect success to be anything other than hard-earned. \"You need to accept that it's going to be a long road before you reach a strong position. However, customers are always looking for an alternative to the market leader, so there are always going to be opportunities.\"</p> <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.newson-gale.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.newson-gale.co.uk</a></p> <p><em>There are two more categories of our Best Practice Exchange competition to enter on a rolling basis - Cashflow and Starting Up.

  "<p>For Mubaloo success in exporting to new markets is about having the right people on the ground. </p> <p>The company, founded by chief executive Mark Mason in 2009, dominates the UK market with the custom-made mobile apps it develops for large B2B and B2C corporates.</p> <p>Last year Mason decided to start looking to expand abroad, but learned a hard lesson early when he tried to break into Germany and hired a Finn living in Berlin. \"We thought we could tap two markets, but he wasn't a national and people found it difficult to work with him. We got our fingers burned a bit so we pulled back.\"</p> <p>The answer came from some advice Mason was given at a networking event: hire nationals who speak the language and live in your target market. \"When I failed first time round I sought out how other people did it. That's when I realised you can't just send someone from the UK and expect them to sell into other countries. It's important that they are nationals and you need to integrate them into your business first.\"</p> <p>Mubaloo's apps are developed in at the company's 40-strong Bristol HQ and \"exported\" by sales staff in New York, Berlin and South America, who identify potential clients and bring in work. </p> <p>\"Instead of trying to cookie cutter what we've got in Bristol and putting teams of developers in other countries, exporting for us is about extending sales teams across the world,\" Mason says. \"A big strength of what we've got in the Bristol office is lots of developers working on different apps, so you get cross-fertilisation of best practice across different industry sectors.\"</p> <p>Mason also says that this approach seemed \"a much more stable way\" to grow the business. \"Because the UK is leading app development in Europe I felt it was important to have a central location. We are incredibly busy in the UK, and you've got to control that growth.\"</p> <p>Understanding how Mubaloo's business works is key for its sales staff who are based abroad. The three new international recruits have each spent six months in the UK office. \"It's about finding those key individuals who can extend our reach,\" Mason says. \"We get them to spend time here, understand our culture and go back to their countries, rather than just give them some credentials and say 'go and sell.'\" </p> <p>From the UK, Mubaloo also spends a lot of time researching emerging markets and investing in travel. Markets such as Ireland, where Mubaloo has developed a wifi hub app, and Gibraltar - gaming and gambling apps - are managed from the UK. \"We put people in the countries where the language is an issue, and where there is high-growth potential,\" says Mason.</p> <p>Around 20% of Mubaloo's business is export-focused, but this figure reaches 40% if Gibraltar is counted (it is a British overseas territory). There is a \u00a31m turnover annually from overseas markets, compared to \u00a31.5m in UK market turnover. \"I think the UK will always be ahead because of the volume of clients we've got here,\" says Mason. \"But I expect exports could grow. I think it could become equal.\"</p> <p><strong>Website: </strong><a href=\"http://mubaloo.com/\">www.mubaloo.com</a></p> <p><em>There are two more categories of our Best Practice Exchange competition to enter on a rolling basis - Cashflow and Starting Up.

  "<p>Eight charities are pooling their expertise and knowledge to set up the <a href=\"http://www.fostering.net/media/2012/fostering-network-joins-seven-leading-charities-launch-care-inquiry\" title=\"\">care inquiry</a> to examine how the care system meets the needs of England's most vulnerable children and young people.</p> <p>It is well known that children who are moved around the care system and do not feel involved in decisions made about them tend to do less well at school and are likely to find it harder to make friends, form and keep close relationships and become independent as adults. It is less well known that many children who grow up with their foster carer, or find a children's home that meets their needs, do very well.</p> <p>The eight charities involved in the inquiry, including my own, have come together to examine the evidence and listen to, and take account of, the views of children and their carers. We can therefore say what works and what doesn't, and identify the most important things that must change to improve the life chances of all children in care today, tomorrow and in the future.</p> <p>The charities, representing organisations involved in fostering, adoption and residential care, all agree that finding a stable home for a child can change their lives, and in turn change what they can achieve as adults. Our ambition for all children in care is that we help them reach their potential and achieve a sense of wellbeing.</p> <p>Adoption, fostering, children's homes, special guardianship and living with a member of their wider family are all ways in which children who can't live with their birth parents can be offered permanent homes. Decisions about a child's future must be taken after an assessment of their needs and take their views into account.</p> <p>We must avoid simplistic views that for some children adoption or fostering are always the right option. Children have a right to expect that adults will make decisions based on their needs and not on the preferences of adults.</p> <p>To date, any analysis of care has tended to be piecemeal rather than a whole system approach. The current government has been focusing heavily on adoption and more recently on residential care. Over the summer they consulted on changing the law to make it easier to limit contact and separate siblings. Any proposals need to be tested in terms of their impact on all children in care.</p> <p>The care inquiry intends to use three sessions in November, December and January to explore how best to achieve stability and a positive sense of identity for children in care and for those raised by family members as an alternative to care. We will make recommendations on the big issues that need to be improved and also feed in to debates in parliament on the forthcoming children and families bill.</p> <p>While some children do well in care, we are currently failing too many children. Not looking after the best interests of children and young people in care now will have an impact on our economy, our prison systems and our NHS. Most importantly, it will leave a generation of care leavers without the opportunities to flourish that they deserve.</p> <p>This inquiry is the first time charities from across the spectrum of care have come together to work in this way, and it provides a real opportunity for change. The third sector has to make its voice heard so it can influence the policy and practice decisions that make a lifetime's difference to children and young people who find themselves in or on the edge of the care system.</p> <p><strong><em>Why not join our community?

  "<p>Ten years ago I was part of a movement called Jubilee 2000, which changed the way people think about debt. It challenged a deeply held principle that \"debts must always be repaid\" by showing how, in the case of many debts owed by impoverished countries, the consequences of repayments were creating nearly unimaginable suffering.</p> <p>We were not calling for an act of charity, but a realisation that the economy we had created was structured in a way that was deeply unfair, exaggerating inequality and poverty in many parts of the world. We didn't want donations, but a change in the rules of engagement.</p> <p>The change in values that the jubilee movement effected forced decision-makers to enact policies that went some way to redressing this injustice. About $125bn of debt was wiped out, and governments were able to start spending money in ways that benefited their people.</p> <p>Yet only 10 years later we find ourselves at the centre of a debt crisis that suggests we were not as successful as we'd hoped. Certainly many were freed from \"debt slavery\", but globally debt boomed, as it was used as a means of papering over the cracks of inequality created by our ever-more global economy.</p> <p>Today, the poorest in our own societies are paying a very high price for a crisis created by reckless lending by banks and over-the-top borrowing. Little has been done to reform a system based on greed and speculation which is creating an even greater chasm between the haves and the have-nots.</p> <p>Of course there is no question that poverty in Europe, even post-crisis, is nowhere near as widespread as it was, and is, in some African countries. However, people in the most indebted European countries such as Greece are suffering rapidly rising poverty, homelessness, unemployment, violence and levels of inequality. For example, six months ago medical researchers reported a sharp rise in rates of suicide, murder and HIV/Aids in Greece as a result of the response to the economic crisis there.</p> <p>Ten years ago, we convinced people of the need for a different approach to debt by bringing to mind a very ancient concept \u2013 a jubilee, recognising the damage that very large debts can do to society. The Hebrew scriptures speak of a jubilee year in which debts are cancelled. They also call for restitution to be made for the damage done by debts \u2013 freeing those sold into slavery to help repay debts, returning lands that had been handed to financiers of debt.</p> <p>The importance of what might be called \"debt justice\" to a wider notion of fairness is not limited to Christianity and Judaism. The Qur'an condemns usury and requires zakah (almsgiving) as an essential duty to prevent wealth being accumulated only among the rich. Dharmic faiths from the Indian sub-continent teach similar principles, teaching that wealth is held not for oneself but on behalf of all human beings.</p> <p>In very different times, all of these faiths have tried to create solutions and to repair the damage that deep inequality can cause to our communities and societies. We would do well to adapt their solutions to the present day.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/jubilee\">What would a jubilee look like today</a>? First, as we said 10 years ago, when the payment of debts causes suffering, impoverishment and growing inequality, it cannot be right that they are paid. Debt is not simply the responsibility of the debtor, the burden of debt needs to be shared. The institutions that created the crisis cannot simply return to making profits with no care for the trail of devastation left behind by their decisions.</p> <p>Secondly, although debts can be just, when taken out in a democratic fashion for productive investment, they are not the only way for governments to raise funds. Taxes can ensure companies and investors in a country pay a fair share for being there. It provides a means of redistributing wealth in a global economy which, it is almost universally acknowledged, is too unequal. Progressive taxation is an important element of solving the problems of economic injustice.</p> <p>Finally, we must introduce rules to ensure financial markets work for people. Regulating flows of money will help move us away from an economy based on speculation and \"making money from money\". It will help control the lenders and will remove the control that financial markets have over every aspect of our lives. Returning money to its original purpose: a means of exchanging goods.</p> <p>Such a jubilee, then, goes well beyond cancelling some debt. Unjust debt is at the heart of our global economy; at the heart of deep inequality between rich and poor, as well as between rich and poor countries. If a jubilee is a call for justice, it must consist of far-reaching changes in the global economy to build a society based on justice, mutual support and community; an economic and political as well as spiritual renewal in our society.</p>",
  "<p>The chairman of the BBC Trust said allegations of sexual abuse by Sir Jimmy Savile could not be excused as behaviour from a time when \"attitudes were different\", and gave his backing to inquiries by police and the corporation.</p> <p>Lord Patten told a business dinner in Cardiff on Monday night it was \"no excuse to say 'that was then' in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, and attitudes were different then\". It is the first time he has spoken of the controversy triggered by a ITV investigation broadcast last Wednesday.</p> <p>\"It's no excuse to say, 'I'm sure the same thing used to happen with pop groups and others at the time'. Those things may be true but they don't provide an excuse,\" he told the Cardiff Business Club.</p> <p>His remarks came just hours after the BBC director general, George Entwistle, offered the corporation's first apologies to alleged victims and pledged the corporation would hold its own inquiry following a police investigation.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police are taking the lead in the inquiries following the emergence of at least 20 claims from women of child abuse by Savile. However at this stage it is a \"scoping out\" exercise and is not a full-blown investigation.</p> <p>Pressure is mounting for a formal inquiry by the police and the BBC after the latest allegations with the former head of the Jersey child abuse investigation said he now suspects that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/08/jimmy-savile-jersey-childrens-home\" title=\"\">Savile was implicated</a> in the Haut de la Garenne children's home abuse scandal.</p> <p>The former head of the Jersey child abuse investigation, Lenny Harper, said he now has \"no reason to doubt\" that Savile was involved in indecent assault at the notorious children's home, despite there being insufficient evidence to question the Jim'll Fix It star when he was alive.</p> <p>On Monday night it emerged that Freddie Starr did appear on a Jimmy Savile show with the woman who accused him of molesting her.</p> <p>Channel 4 unearthed a clip from the BBC programme Clunk Click in 1974, showed a 14-year-old Karin Ward appearing in the background alongside Starr.</p> <p>The entertainer had last week denied allegations he tried to grope Ward and denied ever meeting her on the show.</p> <p>Last night, Starr conceded he had appeared on the programme, with his lawyer releasing a statement saying he had been \"mistaken\".</p> <p>The lawyer told Channel 4 news at his age, Starr \"cannot be expected to recollect every show that he has appeared on and to remember every person that he has ever met\".</p> <p>Ward was one of the women interviewed by BBC2's Newsnight investigation which was controversially dropped last December.</p> <p>Lord Patten echoed Entwistle's announcement and outlined how the BBC would act.</p> <p>He said: \"Immediately these allegations came out, we went to the police, we agreed with Acpo (Association of Chief Police Officers) the way we should handle this and they told us the police inquiry should come first and we shouldn't undertake our own investigation until there had been a police inquiry or we might get in the way of it.</p> <p>\"So there will be a full police inquiry and we will encourage people to co-operate with it, and when that is completed, we will then look at the issues which still remain to be resolved in a way which will have to command credibility in the wider community.</p> <p>\"Because the BBC exists above all on trust and the relationship between the wider public and the BBC itself. And when the BBC is at its best, it's not only because it is providing terrific, creative, challenging TV and radio, it is because the public think they own it and can identify with it. Just think of the Olympics, the torch, the cultural Olympiad \u2013 all of those helped bring the community together.\"</p> <p>Earlier this week the chairman of the BBC Trust had ruled out an independent investigation into the alleged abuses by Savile.</p> <p>In a letter to Conservative MP Rob Wilson, Patten said an inquiry was not necessary despite the gravity of the allegations against the BBC presenter and DJ, which are being investigated by Scotland Yard.</p> <p>Unease about the claims has led to a number of memorials to the star being removed. Yesterday it was announced an inscription on the wall at Leeds Civic Hall in recognition of his charity work will be taken down.</p> <p>A street sign in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, was also taken away in the past few days.</p> <p>Former Radio 1 DJ Liz Kershaw spoke over the weekend about how when she joined Radio 1 in 1987 \u2013 the year Savile left \u2013 his behaviour was an \"open secret\" at the station.</p> <p>She described how she was groped by another presenter as she was broadcasting and was asked when she complained did she not enjoy it, and was she was a lesbian.</p> <p>Broadcaster Janet Street-Porter previously revealed that she was aware of rumours about the television and radio presenter's alleged abuse of under-age girls when she worked at the BBC in the late 1980s.</p> <p>Police child abuse officers have met BBC officials to discuss the allegations concerning Savile.</p> <p>Officers said they were contacting all individuals who have made claims about the late presenter and should know how many reported victims there are some time this week.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>It's that time of year again.

They cower in staff rooms, avoiding the students and any reference requests that might come their way.

Yes, we should.</p> <p>And yet, it's not quite as simple as that. Around 80% of the college's intake will progress into higher education and, of that 80%, around three-quarters will be first generation university goers. So, shouldn't we just be glad that young people from one of the most disadvantaged boroughs of London are just aspiring to succeed?</p> <p>No. What we should be advertising \u2013 wait, what we should be screaming from the rooftops \u2013 is that the students who will submit these applications will be the type who, given the opportunity, should be running the country's hospitals, schools, banks and legal firms.</p> <p>They should be the Oxbridge alumni and highly paid neurosurgeons. It is just that this opportunity will rarely materialise. Most will slip through the net, either during the application process or following an interview. Their words and aspirations often falling on the deaf ears of professors and academics who are looking for polished, professional young adults, with a string of A* grades on their CV. And sometimes, up here, that just isn't possible.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the statements that I spend my days reading remain a testament to their achievements so far. The Somalian boy who has been in the country for three years, who never attended any school until he arrived here from war-torn Mogadishu, yet has unparalleled drive to succeed. The volunteer who works with youth offenders, offering them anger management solutions and a non-judgemental ear; the student who is the sole carer for her elderly, stroke-suffering grandmother. The aspiring theoretical physicist who emails at 3am, because that's the only time in his house that he has peace.</p> <p>So I take hope from the week and the college's other hard-earned successes. Last week, I was visited by a favourite of my old students. He wasn't there to ask for favours this time; he wanted to give me an update. That, yes, he'd continued to work just as hard for his university exams and on job applications. And, contrary to the odds stacked against him, he had been offered various training contracts for the end of his degree with the country's top magic circle law firms. That he held these offers there in the palm of his hand, indulged by partner dinners and endless tweaks to his proposed contracts, making his decision about who to choose. That the tables had certainly turned in his favour. That he is ethnically diverse makes this interesting. That he is from a very deprived area of east London makes this exciting.</p> <p>So I do, I take hope from this week. I think I'll avoid thinking about English GCSE grades and rising child poverty. I won't focus on gang fights, underage pregnancy or child obesity. I probably won't even think about Michael Gove. I'll just think about these amazing young people who, regardless of the outcome of this week, will go on to make a difference in their communities and maybe further afield, offering guidance to younger children, enthusing them with their own aspirations, changing the lives of others for the better. These are the students who will work flat out for everything they can, just to improve their lives and the lives of their families, just to obtain the opportunities that many young people in this country take for granted.</p> <p><em>Antonia Miller works at a sixth form college in East London and has specific responsibility for UCAS applications.

From the vehicle's windows green and white flags flew.</p> <p>Inside were a dozen or so landless peasant farmers, heading to Delhi, the capital, to confront their nation's leaders and press their right to land. So far the marchers, 50,000-strong according to the organisers, have covered around 80 kilometres, not even a quarter of the distance they hope to travel. Their march will take another three weeks.</p> <p>They have come from Kerala in the south-west to Bengal in the north-east, all drawn from the poorest of the Indian poor. They had gathered at the northern town of Gwalior, and then set off last Wednesday, the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's birth, inspired by the independence leader's own tactics.</p> <p>PV Rajagopal, the veteran activist who organised the <em>yatra</em> (pilgrimage), told the Guardian that the participants' aim was not just to win a \"right to land\" but to fundamentally alter the direction of India's development.</p> <p>\"There is conflict at every level with the model we have now. Gandhi's vision in this country is being rejected every day. Now we have a capitalist, consumerist model. If India does not change this, the writing is on the wall,\" he said, explaining that a similar, smaller march in 2007 had had an insufficient impact.</p> <p>There are many who argue that such views are naive and that India's development \u2013 and thus the eradication of poverty \u2013 depends on urbanisation, massive investment in infrastructure and the development of a manufacturing base capable of providing employment for huge numbers of people, especially the young.</p> <p>Then there are those who argue that the sanctification of rural life inspired by Gandhi has contributed to the tenacity of poverty in India.</p> <p>Rajagopal, who made his name negotiating the surrender of bandits in the rough countryside around Gwalior in the early 1970s, disagrees.</p> <p>\"Nearly 100,000 villages have been destroyed since India gained its independence. I cannot accept industrialisation at this cost,\" he said.</p> <p>The inhabitants of Badpura exist on the margins of Indian society and economy. A cluster of mud-walled homes on a high, rocky ridge perched above the plains around Gwalior, it is home to around 100 families.</p> <p>Some are from the lowest ranks of the caste system, the millennia-old social hierarchy that is still powerful in India. Others are so-called \"adivasi\"<em> </em>(tribals), who can trace their origins back to the subcontinent's most ancient inhabitants and who often live in forest or hill areas that are now prized by industry for their raw materials. At best the <em>adiviasi</em> have gained little from the two decades of economic boom in India. Often they have lost a great deal.</p> <p>Certainly the \"Shining India\" of booming infotech industries and luxury car markets is a long way from Badpura. There is only a basic school, and healthcare is restricted to occasional visits by government health workers. One girl who can read and write her own name is proudly described as \"literate\". Meat is a rare treat. The villagers weed the local farmers' fields, earning 50 rupees (60p) a day. If they now have intermittent electricity, the villagers also suffer from soaring prices for basic foodstuffs and outbreaks of tuberculosis.</p> <p>\"It is tough but somehow we manage,\" said Sunder Bai, a mother of seven who did not know her own age.</p> <p>The key question for the villagers, as for so many in this vast but crowded country, is land. They want deeds to the scruffy patches of semi-scrub around Badpura that they have tilled or grazed livestock on for decades. But, at least in legal terms, these few hectares hacked out of the forest belong to the government The villagers have to fight a running battle with local officials who seize their tools and destroy their crops. Several have even been taken to court.</p> <p>\"We, the adivasis, are the owners, not the government. We own the forest because we have lived in the forests since forever. The firewood is ours but they take if from us,\" said Bai.</p> <p>Almost every group of marchers heading to Delhi has a similar story. Camped in a vast, derelict parade ground on the eve of the march, participants squatted around communal stoves to share rice or flat bread \u2013 their one meal of the day \u2013 before sleeping in the dust. Faded, frayed clothes hung from lines, drying in the dying rays of the sun.</p> <p>Nandina Devi, from a small village of dalits, the castes once known as \"untouchable\", in violence-prone Bihar state, said when she spoke out against harassment by officials she was accused of being a Naxalite, one of the Maoist guerillas waging an armed insurgency against central government.</p> <p>\"There is not one Maoist among us. We just want recognition that we own our land,\" she said.</p> <p>Kamdra Munda, a 45-year-old adivasi farmer from Chhattisgarh state, the heart of the Naxalite insurgency, said he too had been harassed. When he saw the masses gathered for the march he felt \"happy and brave\".</p> <p>The demonstration is a problem for the ruling Congress party which has long drawn support from the rural poor. Their votes will be crucial in elections due in 2014. Jairam Ramesh, minister for rural development, travelled to Gwalior in a bid to persuade the tens of thousands to abandon their plans.</p> <p>\"Your claims are justified. We are working on these issues,\" he told the crowds.</p> <p>With Ramesh, evidence of how little some things in India change, was a local Congress MP, Jjyotiraditya Scindia. The giant fort which dominates Gwalior was for centuries the seat of the Scindia dynasty. The MP is the grandson of the last maharajah.</p> <p>The marchers did not listen to Ramesh's plea not to travel to the capital.</p> <p>\"The politicians pass laws which are never implemented. We will go to Delhi and we will not leave until we have what we want,\" said Ramtha Yadav, a landless labourer from Uttar Pradesh state whose socio-economic indicators are often worse than those of sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>One problem for the Congress party is that the vast flagship subsidy programmes which are meant to ensure basic levels of nutrition and employment among India's very poor \u2013 and to gain their votes \u2013 are riddled with graft and inefficiency. Hugely expensive, these programmes often fail to reach the most needy.</p> <p>\"We get nothing, no rice, no employment, nothing but a couple of bottles of cooking gas if we are lucky,\" said Yadav, 26. \"The government takes, but gives us nothing.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/09/27/indias-land-acquisition-bill-gets-more-business-friendly/\" title=\"\">New legislation aiming to simplify the complex and archaic land laws in India</a> and ensure fairer compensation for those displaced by new infrastructure projects or industry is stuck in parliament and unlikely to be passed soon.</p> <p>The march has attracted attention from overseas. Karima Delli, a French Green MEP, said that European organisations were inspired by the marchers and their non-violent tactics.</p> <p>\"The earth can't take any more. Everywhere peasants are suffering, sidelined by the multinationals and big business. No silence, no violence,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I don't know about big companies,\" said Yadav. \"I've just had enough of sleeping under trees.\"</p>",
  "<p>Householders who resort to physical force to deter burglars will be given greater protection from the law, the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, will announce on Tuesday as he abandons the legacy of his moderate predecessor, Kenneth Clarke.</p> <p>In a sign of Downing Street's tougher approach on law and order, Grayling will pledge to change the law to ensure householders can use \"disproportionate\" force in certain circumstances.</p> <p>Grayling's move is designed to show that No 10 is heeding the concerns of key voters, hailed by ministers as \"strivers\", who fear the government is losing sight of law and order issues as it grapples with the fiscal deficit.</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne, reached out to the \"strivers\" when he told the conference he had agreed with the welfare secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, to cut as much as \u00a310bn more from the welfare budget, starting in the pre-election year of 2015-16. He also ruled out the Liberal Democrat plans for a mansion tax. \"The party of homeowners will have no truck with a homes tax,\" he said.</p> <p>The broad proposals for an extra \u00a310bn cut in welfare have been agreed with senior Liberal Democrats, Tory ministers claim. But this is being denied by Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister.</p> <p>The Lib Dems are likely to watch with care as Grayling makes a bid to become the toast of the Tory conference.</p> <p>The justice secretary will say: \"Being confronted by an intruder in your own home is terrifying, and the public should be in no doubt that the law is on their side. That is why I am strengthening the current law.</p> <p>\"Householders who act instinctively and honestly in self-defence are victims of crime and should be treated that way. We need to dispel doubts in this area once and for all, and I am very pleased to be today delivering on the pledge that we made in opposition.\"</p> <p>The change to the law, which is likely to be signalled in the next Queen's speech, will for the first time mean that householders can use \"disproportionate\" force in exceptional circumstances. Under the current law, homeowners are allowed to use \"reasonable force\" to defend themselves in their home or on the street to protect others, to prevent crime or to protect property. But the force cannot be disproportionate.</p> <p>Grayling's change will mean that if a householder uses force which he or she believed was reasonable at the time, but was in fact disproportionate, then that could be deemed to be lawful.</p> <p>\"This is not about letting people go on the rampage. There is a difference between grabbing a bedside lamp and whacking an intruder because you are worried about the children and hitting someone and then stabbing them 17 times,\" one source said.</p> <p>The announcement by Grayling is designed to ensure there can be no repeat of the experience of Andy and Tracey Ferrie, who were held for 40 hours after using a legally held weapon to protect their remote Leicestershire cottage. Two intruders were injured.</p> <p>The lord chief justice, Lord Judge, questioned whether angry and frightened householders should be treated like criminals. In the runup to the 2001 general election, the Conservative leader, William Hague, pledged to change the law after Tony Martin was jailed for confronting a burglar, Brendan Fearon, and his accomplice, Fred Barras, 16, at his Norfolk home in 1999. Martin killed Barras and wounded Fearon. The welfare cuts were one of three policies sprung by Osborne that left Lib Dem coalition colleagues uneasy. The other two policies were a new breed of company freed from Britain's unfair dismissal laws, and generous tax incentives for shale gas.</p> <p>Nick Clegg indicated that more work would need to be done before the \u00a310bn in cuts were agreed. The deputy prime minister is not wedded to the mansion tax but he insists the rich must make a greater contribution to deficit reduction if he is to agree to the \u00a310bn cuts \u2013 something the Tories say they can agree to.</p> <p>Clegg said: \"Nothing in detail has been agreed on further cuts or savings to welfare. The Conservatives are, of course, entirely entitled to set out their stall about what we do as a country if we have to tighten our belts further, as we, indeed, were at our party conference. My attitude has always been very simple, very straightforward \u2013 which is that as we have to make more savings as country, as we do, we start at the top and work down \u2013 not the other way round.\"</p> <p>In his speech Osborne said that 80% of the further \u00a316bn deficit reduction needed from 2015-16 would have to come from spending cuts, not tax rises, putting an unavoidable squeeze on the welfare budget.</p> <p>The Tories also claimed that the Lib Dems were backing plans to introduce a new breed of small business, unveiled by Osborne, in which the workers would be given shares exempt from capital gains tax in return for signing away most of their employment rights.</p> <p>The proposal seems a way to reintroduce proposals backed by Adrian Beecroft to tear up employment rights, including an erosion of maternity rights, mainly in small firms.</p> <p>Those plans were blocked by the business secretary, Vince Cable, but the pill has been sweetened by the commitment for firms to offer shares to their more flexible workforce.</p>",
  "<p>When Michael O'Leary, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/en\" title=\"\">Ryanair</a>, recently whipped up a social media storm after calling a customer who had criticised his airline on Facebook \"an idiot\", he unwittingly demonstrated how an organisation's attitude to digital is led from the top.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.lasa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Lasa</a> we've been funded by Google to help charities engage with digital, and our goal is to get the key issues on decision makers' agendas. We asked leading figures in the voluntary sector across the globe to tell us, in bullet point form, what five things their peers needed to know about digital. The resulting crowdsourced Digital: what every charity leader should know report includes contributions from Martha Lane Fox, Beth Kanter, Unicef UK and JustGiving. Their views are a call to arms to charity leaders to maximise digital's potential for income generation, collaboration and reaching stakeholders, ultimately creating a more sustainable sector.</p> <p>We'll be debating the report's findings at a special Lasa event for charity chief executives and opinion leaders on 6 November hosted by commercial and charity law firm <a href=\"http://www.bateswells.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bates Wells and Braithwaite</a>. And we're inviting anyone in the sector to share their ideas on what every charity leader should know about digital by tweeting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LasaICT\" title=\"\">@Lasaict </a>using the hashtag #Lasaleaders.</p> <h2>The key insights from the report are:</h2> <p>\u2022 Digital is vital for charity leadership. Beth Kanter, author of The Networked NonProfit, advised charity leaders to \"be present, authentic, and human on social networks, sharing a bit of yourself as well as your organisation's goals\". Meanwhile Graham Fisher from <a href=\"http://www.toynbeehall.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Toynbee Hall</a> said that fellow chief executives should deploy digital to \"improve your service access, effectiveness, efficiency and quality, opening new markets for new products.\" Sam Matthews, acting chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.ces-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Charities Evaluation Services</a>, warned that chief executives must own digital, \"driving the agenda forward\" and using it to monitor impact through tools such as databases.</p> <p>\u2022 Digital must be part of your organisational strategy. Martha Lane Fox, chair of <a href=\"http://www.go-on.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Go ON UK</a>, highlighted the growth of digital fundraising (in the last quarter of last year 15% of donations were made online), telling charity leaders that there was \"no time to waste\" in getting digital strategies in place.</p> <p>Doug Jacquier, strategy consultant, emphasised digital engagement as critical: \"A technology plan is core to your strategic survival \u2013 if you're not understanding and managing your organisation's technology, you shouldn't be in the job.\" Karl Wilding, head of foresight at <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NCVO</a>, said that leaders also need to \"plan for the opportunities (outcomes measurement; better fundraising) and costs (data protection and management) that big data are going to bring.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Charity leaders should innovate and engage through digital. Digital tools can reinvigorate relationships with stakeholders and reach new audiences. Independent charity adviser Rosie Chapman discussed how the <a href=\"http://www.hawkandowl.org/\" title=\"\">Hawk and Owl Trust</a>'s online webcam of nesting peregrines led to an increase in membership and donations. Marnie Webb, Co-head of <a href=\"http://www.techsoupglobal.org/\" title=\"\">Techsoup Global</a>, described how technology can help a charity's supporters take immediate actions (eg post-disaster relief) using tools such as <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a>. Damien Austin-Walker, head of digital at <a href=\"http://vinspired.com/\" title=\"\">vInspired</a>, predicted that \"tablet will become the new desktop\" and that \"second screen usage is becoming the norm.\"</p> <p>As the choice of digital media expands, Rachel Beer, founder of <a href=\"http://hellobeautifulworld.com/\" title=\"\">Beautiful World</a>, told charity leaders that their organisations must \"stand out and be interesting, not just worthy\" in an increasingly crowded marketplace.</p> <p>\u2022 Digital can improve the bottom line. Nigel Lewis, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/\" title=\"\">AbilityNet</a>, stated that digital can help charities save money and time, as \"solutions and service providers exist at very low or no cost.\" Danielle Atkinson, head of digital and individual giving at <a href=\"http://www.merlin.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Merlin</a>, said digital pays dividends in the long run: \"Income generation won't happen overnight and you can't expect any gains if you don't invest or resource digital properly.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Social media can help charity leaders connect directly with stakeholders. Lucy Caldicott, director of fundraising at <a href=\"http://www.clicsargent.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Clic Sargent</a>, said that social media is an \"invaluable way to keep your finger on the pulse.\" Ross McCulloch, founder of <a href=\"http://thirdsectorlab.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Thirdsectorlab</a>, counselled against leaders posting \"a stream of organisational updates\", if they truly want to connect with supporters, who \"want to know about the opinions, work and passions of you as a chief executive/chair/director/.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Mobile is the future. Holly Ross, executive director of US non-profit <a href=\"http://www.nten.org/\" title=\"\">Nten</a>, thinks that mobile is the \"next big tech innovation,\", while Paul de Gregorio, head of mobile at <a href=\"http://openfundraising.com/\" title=\"\">Open Fundraising</a>, went further, saying charity leaders should be aware that mobile is now mainstream: \"Thanks to high profile events like <a href=\"http://www.comicrelief.com/\" title=\"\">Comic Relief</a>, the public are increasingly used to donating by text.\"</p> <p>The message from the report is clear. Digital won't just help build a more sustainable sector; it's a vital element of charity leadership. As Jonathan Waddingham of <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com/\" title=\"\">JustGiving</a> put it: \"Understanding how people communicate, how to reach them and how to inspire them is more important than any tool.\"</p> <p>You can read Lasa's digital report <a href=\"http://www.lasa.org.uk/news/detail/opinion-leaders-argue-that-digital-is-key-to-sector-sustainability-in-new-r/\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p><em>Zoe Amar is head of marketing and business development at</em><a href=\"http://www.lasa.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em> Lasa</em></a><em>. </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

When it was unveiled, many had called it the future of mobile computing.</p> </blockquote> <p> More like \"some\" had called it the future. And it still looks promising.
