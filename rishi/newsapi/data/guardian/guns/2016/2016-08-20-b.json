  "<p>When Nate Parker \u201carrived\u201d with the screening of his film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/15/birth-of-a-nation-trailer-sundance-film-festival-oscars\" title=\"\"><em>The Birth of a Nation</em></a> at the Sundance festival in January, the timing couldn\u2019t have been more urgent.</p> <p>Ten days before its unveiling, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/oscarssowhite-mocks-awards-show-inequality\" title=\"\">#OscarsSoWhite</a> had begun to trend again on Twitter. For the second year in a row, no actors of colour were nominated for an Academy Award. Here was an incendiary-looking picture from a first-time African American film\u2011maker, featuring a mostly black cast, and centring on Nat Turner, a former slave who led a brutally violent revolt in 1831 to free slaves in Virginia. The film had the potential to seize the moment \u2013 and it did.</p> <p>The Sundance screening was key. Parker had ensured that cast, crew, friends and family made the trek to Park City, Utah, for his film\u2019s premiere. Their energy was felt in the room. Before the screening even got under way, the crowd stood as soon as Parker\u2019s name was called. Once it concluded, a second, and much longer, ovation followed, with many in attendance seen drying their tears.</p> <p>Immediate reactions on Twitter were ecstatic. A bidding war between the hottest arthouse distributors followed. Fox Searchlight, the company that led the similarly themed <em>12 Years a Slave</em> to a best picture Oscar win in 2014, was the victor, purportedly beating Netflix to land the film for $17.5m (a colossal amount by Sundance standards).</p> <p>Its aim in spending so much was clear: <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> would be their great Oscar hope. It came as no surprise when the film won the grand jury prize as well as the audience award; no other selection came close to matching its impact on the industry during the 10-day span of the festival. It seemed nothing could possibly derail\u2019s Parker\u2019s rise from little-known actor to Hollywood\u2019s new hope.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s since been revealed that the woman at the centre of the case, who had a child, killed herself in 2012</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Imagine, then, the shockwaves that reverberated through Hollywood when Parker publicly addressed a rape trial from his college years in two trade interviews tied to his impending awards campaign. Before he spoke out about the 1999 incident to <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/the-birth-of-a-nation-nate-parker-rape-trial-1201836624/\" title=\"\"><em>Variety</em></a> and <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/08/nate-parker-sex-case-the-birth-of-a-nation-oscar-race-fox-searchlight-1201799115/\" title=\"\"><em>Deadline</em></a>, two of Hollywood\u2019s most trusted sources, few were aware of the rape charge, of which he had been cleared. Suddenly, Parker\u2019s past troubles threaten to tarnish his passion project.</p> <p>Parker was born in Norfolk, Virginia, the same state where Turner was born into slavery, a fact Parker only discovered when he took African American studies at college. \u201cImagine my dismay,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/birth-a-nation-slave-revolt-857177\" title=\"\">he told the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a> before arriving at Sundance, \u201cin learning that one of the greatest men to walk the soil in this country was a man who grew up and lived and breathed and fought less than 100 miles from where I grew up.\u201d</p> <p>His mother Carolyn \u2013 she was 17 years old when she gave birth to Parker \u2013 is a devout Christian, exerting a huge influence on Parker, now himself father to five young children. <a href=\"http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/august-web-only/conversation-with-nate-parker-about-birth-of-nation.html\" title=\"\">Speaking to <em>Christianity Today</em></a> Parker relayed what he viewed as the spiritual significance of <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>: \u201cIf you\u2019re able to view this film without the baggage of racism, then it\u2019s very clearly a story of someone that was compelled by his faith to act as the hand of the God through his interpretation.\u201d</p> <p>Carolyn never married Parker\u2019s biological father, instead first wedding the man who would give Parker his surname; she later married Walter Whitfield, an air force man, who uprooted his new family to Maine. When Parker was 11, his biological father, with whom he\u2019d kept in touch, died of cancer with little warning. His death, coupled with all the changes, proved to be a lot for Parker, according to his mother, who has said that her son became \u201cquite depressed\u201d.</p> <p>He channelled his depression into anger, taking his demons out on classmates during his teenage years by beating them up at school. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just rage,\u201d Parker recalled. \u201cIt was just being a kid that needed some kind of clarity.\u201d Aged 14, unable to bond with his new stepfather, Carolyn had her son return to Virginia to live with her brother Jay Combs, a former wrestler, who encouraged Parker to join his high school\u2019s wrestling team. Parker was a natural at the sport and landed a full wrestling scholarship to Pennsylvania State University.</p> <p>It was at the beginning of his second year, in 1999, when he and Jean Celestin, a friend from the wrestling team, were charged with the rape and sexual assault of an 18-year-old female student, who claimed to have been unconscious during the alleged attack.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3034dc8a704d45ff1a5722e5380109c8b0ef00ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3034dc8a704d45ff1a5722e5380109c8b0ef00ad/0_0_1020_612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armie Hammer, left, and Nate Parker, in a scene from The Birth of a Nation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Armie Hammer, left, and Nate Parker, in a scene from <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elliot Davis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the case went viral on campus, the pair were suspended from the team. Parker, who had had an earlier sexual encounter with the woman, which both said was consensual, was acquitted of the charges in 2001, while Celestin was found guilty of sexual assault, before being granted a new trial in 2005. That case never came to court after prosecutors balked at tracking down all the former witnesses. Court documents show that the woman said she was harassed by Parker and Celestin after she reported the incident to the police. She dropped out of college as a result.</p> <p>It\u2019s since been revealed that the woman at the centre of the case, who had a child, killed herself in 2012. Parker responded to the development on his Facebook page, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/17/nate-parker-devastated-by-suicide-of-accuser\" title=\"\">saying he was \u201cdevastated\u201d</a>. \u201cAs a 36-year-old father of daughters and person of faith, I look back on that time as a teenager and can say without hesitation that I should have used more wisdom,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>After the trial, Parker transferred to the University of Oklahoma, where he earned a degree in management science and information systems, and quickly landed work designing websites. He had no aspirations to become an actor \u2013 instead he was roped into a newfound career after being approached by Jon Simmons, the agent who still represents him, at a talent search in Dallas, Texas, where his friend, an aspiring model, was hoping to get a gig.</p> <p>The story goes that Simmons had Parker cold-read a scene from <em>The Fast and the Furious</em> and Parker was hooked. \u201cThe way it made me feel, it was like winning a match times a hundred,\u201d he told the <em>Virginian-Pilot</em>. Naturally, he relocated to Los Angeles.</p> <p>Parker\u2019s enviable bone structure and toned figure were noticed immediately, landing him small roles despite the fact he had no prior acting experience. In 2007, he put his athletic frame to use in the swimming-team drama <em>Pride</em>, which saw him act opposite Terrence Howard. His charisma impressed Denzel Washington, who cast him a year later&#xa0;in&#xa0;<em>The Great Debaters</em>, where Parker delivered a breakthrough performance as a student on an all-black&#xa0;debating team in 1935.</p> <p>From there, more well-received supporting performances followed: for Spike Lee, he ventured to Brooklyn in <em>Red Hook Summer</em> (2012); he conspired with Richard Gere in the financial thriller <em>Arbitrage</em> the same year. Despite his popularity, Parker soon arrived at a crossroads, uninspired creatively by the roles he was being offered. \u201cSo few of them had integrity,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/birth-a-nation-slave-revolt-857177\" title=\"\">he told the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em>.</a> \u201cAs a black man, you leave auditions not hoping you get the job but wondering how you explain it to your family if you do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/campus-sexual-assault-university-colorado-austin-wilkerson\">'Inspired by other survivors\u2019: campus rape victim demands to be heard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once shooting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/14/beyond-the-lights-review\" title=\"\"><em>Beyond the Lights</em></a> (2014) wrapped, Parker met his agents to tell them he would not be accepting any more projects until he could get his own film about American revolutionary Nat Turner off the ground. He stuck to his word, not working for two years on anything but what would come to be known as <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, provocatively named after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jul/29/birth-of-a-nation-dw-griffith-masterpiece\" title=\"\">DW Griffith\u2019s notoriously racist 1915 film.</a> Parker had written and directed a couple of short films; putting together a feature posed a foreign challenge. To get it all rolling, he invested $100,000 of his own money before securing backers, including retired NBA player Michael Finley.</p> <p>The future of <em>The Birth of Nation</em> remains in doubt. Parker is expected to promote the film as planned, taking it to the Toronto international film festival in September, followed by a tour to churches and campusescorrect around the US, where he\u2019ll discuss the issues of social justice raised by the film. But as awards season expert and <em>Indiewire</em>\u2019s editor-at-large Anne Thompson notes, the issue of rape \u201cis going to keep coming up\u201d, despite Parker\u2019s wishes to the contrary. (He told <em>Deadline</em>: \u201cI will not relive that period of my life every time I go under the microscope.\u201d)</p> <p>There\u2019s no avoiding it, argues Thompson, because Turner\u2019s quest for retribution is largely set in motion because of a horrific rape.</p> <p>Thompson believes there\u2019s \u201cno precedent\u201d for the situation Parker finds himself in. \u201cThe pattern with more&#xa0;established people in Hollywood&#xa0;is forgive and forget,\u201d she says, citing Roman Polanski and Woody Allen, both of whom were also embroiled in rape controversies and yet managed to maintain their standing. \u201cThe larger Hollywood community doesn\u2019t know Nate Parker. And they need to find out who he is.\u201d As for the general public, many might find the very idea of worrying about Hollywood\u2019s assessment \u2013 or debates about the quality of the film \u2013 secondary concerns in the circumstances.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later today</p> <h2>The Parker file</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Nathaniel Emanuel Combs, 18&#xa0;November, 1979 in Norfolk, Virginia.</p> <p><strong>Best of times</strong> Taking his first full-length feature film,<em>The Birth of a Nation,</em> to the Sundance film festival, where it scored the biggest sale in the event\u2019s history, as well as winning the grand jury prize.</p> <p><strong>What he says</strong> \u201cFar too often, as a black actor... you receive a hundred scripts in a&#xa0;year and two of them you feel represent&#xa0;the experience of the black male&#xa0;with strength and power and integrity.

  "<p>When Boris Johnson was working for the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> in Brussels in the early 1990s, rival British correspondents dreaded midnight calls from their news desks in London. Sonia Purnell, Johnson\u2019s biographer, who worked with him at the time, recalls that Boris\u2019s stories about the curvature of bananas, the shape of cucumbers and other EU absurdities were known as \u201cduvet blasters\u201d. Despairing reporters were ordered out of bed to write follow-ups. \u201cThe stories were almost always wrong but they would still blast everyone\u2019s duvets,\u201d says Purnell. For the young Johnson, it was good journalistic fun.</p> <p>The Brussels establishment regarded the British hack as an irritant set on lampooning Europe\u2019s institutions at every opportunity. But back in London, John Major\u2019s Tory government, beset by Eurosceptic rebellion, was more worried. The foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, could see that Johnson was framing a new, populist form of Euroscepticism that was spreading beyond Westminster, by depicting Brussels as power-grabbing and ludicrously bureaucratic. A little noticed historical irony is that a young Tory MP called<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis\" title=\"\"> David Davis</a>, who was a whip steering the vote for the Maastricht treaty before he became Europe minister in 1994, was working hard with the Foreign Office to contain the Eurosceptic rebellions by Tory MPs as Johnson stoked them.</p> <p>More than two decades on, and two months after the UK voted to leave the EU, partly as a result of his role in the Brexit campaign, Europe is no longer a target for Johnsonian ridicule. The man who arguably did more than any to lead Britain out \u2013 and was then stunningly installed by Theresa May as foreign secretary \u2013 has been charged with the giant task of shaping a vision of life after Brexit for the British people.</p> <p>Alongside none other than Davis, the new Brexit secretary, who is now anti-EU, and Liam Fox, who Johnson has long viewed as far too rightwing, he has very serious work to do. In a symbolic gesture of her determination to bind the three awkward Brexiters together in joint responsibility for what they delivered, the prime minister has told Johnson, Davis and Fox to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/boris-johnson-forced-to-share-mansion-with-liam-fox-and-david-davis\" title=\"\">share the sumptuous traditional residence of the foreign secretary, Chevening</a>, in Kent, and to get on with the job. \u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d says May, though so far she has given precious few clues as to what she believes that means.</p> <p>When politics resumes in earnest next month, the biggest question facing Britain will increasingly be asked of the three Brexit ministers: what is your Brexit plan? Currently no one seems to know, partly because post-Brexit planning featured hardly at all in the priorities of either the Leave or Remain camps during the referendum campaign. Few thought Brexit would happen. In recent weeks there have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/14/liam-fox-attempt-wrest-control-foreign-office-duties-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">squabbles between Johnson, Fox and Davis</a> over staffing of their departments and turf wars over areas of responsibility that do not augur well. But there has been little sign of clarity on the big picture issues that must be sorted out \u2013 the largest of all being the UK\u2019s future involvement in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/uk-membership-european-single-market-worth-4-more-gdp-eu-referendum-economy\" title=\"\">the single market</a> \u2013 before detailed discussions can begin on any of the matters that will profoundly affect British people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>The Treasury has admittedly said that scientists, universities and infrastructure projects will have their level of EU funding matched after Brexit, and that equivalent payments will carry on to farmers until 2020. After that a new system to replace the common agricultural policy will have to be developed. But among the myriad other questions likely to remain unresolved for some time are the rights of more than 1.2 million expat Brits who live in the EU, the rights of EU citizens to remain in Britain, the UK\u2019s participation in EU security and counterterrorism and defence policy, and the ability of firms to trade in financial services across the EU. Not to mention the constitutional nightmares that loom, including those affecting Scotland, whose SNP government wants to stay in the EU and is threatening to call another independence referendum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e9f192ccf28b54606239f049a11dbbe911e43ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e9f192ccf28b54606239f049a11dbbe911e43ea/0_292_2334_2917/800.jpg\" alt=\"David Davis, who was once charged with steering the vote for the Maastricht treaty, is now on the other side of the fence as Brexit minister.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Davis, who was once charged with steering the vote for the Maastricht treaty, is now on the other side of the fence as Brexit minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The issue of the UK and the EU single market in goods and services is critical. Before the referendum, May strongly suggested the UK should remain a member in the event of Brexit. Now, whether and how it can do so is the multibillion-euro question at the heart of the Brexit dilemma. The single market serves 500 million EU citizens, allowing the free movement of goods, people, services and capital between member countries. If the UK quits the single market, it will lose full access and many large UK businesses warn of devastating economic results. But if it remains a member, after quitting the EU as a whole, it must play by its rules, continue to pay into the EU budget and accept the right of EU citizens to live and work in the UK. For hardline Brexiters \u2013 who promised that Brexit would save \u00a3350m a week in EU budget contributions that could then go to the NHS, and the restoration of UK control over its own borders \u2013 that would be unacceptable. It would render Brexit meaningless, they say.</p> <p>Thus far, however, the May government has been unable to give clear and consistent answers on the single-market question, because the Tory party and the cabinet is split and the complexities are only now being grasped. Senior UK diplomats have been shocked by how little leading Tories in government \u2013 including Johnson \u2013 understand about the workings of the EU and its single market.</p> <p>\u201cIt is staggering,\u201d said one top UK official. \u201cThey have not even got to base one in terms of knowledge.\u201d Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform in London, says some \u201cvery senior\u201d people in the UK government are deeply ignorant about the single market, and adds that only now are the Brexit-backers beginning to grasp the difficulty of what faces them. \u201cI think that two months down the line the senior Brexiters are beginning to realise that the whole process is going to be a lot more complicated, time-consuming and boring than they had imagined before, when they had presented it all as black and white. They are beginning to realise that this will occupy most of the energies of government for the next five to 10 years.</p> <p>\u201cThat does not mean that Brexit is not going to happen. Of course it is going to happen. But it is a massively complex and lengthy business.\u201d</p> <p>The most pressing question, in terms of the Brexit timetable, is when the UK will trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, which will set the clock ticking on two years of formal negotiations on the UK-EU divorce. That period can, theoretically, be extended beyond two years, but only with the unlikely unanimous agreement of all the 27 other member states. But until the UK government decides the broad parameters of its approach, it is hugely difficult to name a start date.</p> <p>At present the intention is to trigger article 50 early in 2017, probably in February. But one senior EU diplomat says that is now looking optimistic. \u201cWe have to be clear by then about the single market, about the budget and free movement. Views on that depend on who you talk to and what day of the week it is.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after the Brexit vote on 23&#xa0;June, May\u2019s new chancellor, Philip Hammond, declared that the result meant we would have to leave. But the Brexit department run by Davis refuses to confirm that now, saying it does not have a firm position. \u201cWe do not give a running commentary,\u201d said a spokeswoman last week. Contradictory messages abound. Johnson suggested on a recent trip to New York that he thought a balance could be struck (a compromise?) over the single market and free movement, while Davis and Fox seem to believe that we can wave it goodbye and do new trade deals with countries across the world, although these would take years to negotiate.</p> <p>Only a few days ago an official House of Commons paper to MPs said that the option of remaining in the single market was live and that the UK, like Norway, could still pay into the EU budget. \u201cFollowing a negotiated departure, the UK may still make contributions to the EU budget,\u201d says the briefing. \u201cAny future contributions will depend on the arrangements agreed for the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU after leaving. Members of the European Economic Area (EEA), for example, contribute to the EU budget, so if the UK joins the EEA it is likely to pay into the EU budget.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fc1a27c3901aa7e4980c07b600c6cc9f59980e18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc1a27c3901aa7e4980c07b600c6cc9f59980e18/0_294_2796_3492/801.jpg\" alt=\"International trade secretary Liam Fox has reportedly launched a power grab on Boris Johnson\u2019s Foreign Office over who should control commerce policy.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">International trade secretary Liam Fox has reportedly launched a power grab on Boris Johnson\u2019s Foreign Office over who should control commerce policy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the European Policy Centre in Brussels, says pressure is building in EU capitals for May\u2019s government to get on with triggering article 50. The EU must start discussions soon on its new seven-year budget, to run from 2020, but cannot do so without knowing where the UK, currently a big net contributor, stands. Elections in France and Germany next year will further complicate the picture, causing a drag on progress. Ideas about how to maximise UK involvement after Brexit are being floated in EU capitals. Michael Roth, a German foreign affairs minister, says that the UK could be given \u201cspecial status\u201d after Brexit. But he wisely offers no detail. Any suggestions the UK might be granted new half-in, half-out, arrangements \u2013 including an offer of a seven-year emergency brake on freedom of movement while remaining inside the single market \u2013 are shouted down by purist Brexiters as betrayal of the will of the British people and unacceptable. Serious issues require urgent attention, including the future UK involvement in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/europol-chief-says-brexit-would-harm-uk-crime-fighting\" title=\"\">Europol</a>, the EU\u2019s international crime fighting agency, whose coordination centre and secure information network allows law enforcement agencies to carry out more than 13,500 cross-border investigations each year. May has said that in a dangerous world the UK is safer if it is involved in Europol and the European arrest warrant. The UK has until the end of this year to opt in to Europol\u2019s new regulations, which come into force next May. If it doesn\u2019t do so, it can apply for a diluted form of membership, with less access to services and key databases. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/europol-chief-says-brexit-would-harm-uk-crime-fighting\" title=\"\">Europol\u2019s British director, Rob Wainwright</a>, is hopeful that the UK will sign up, but hardline Brexit supporters resist, saying it would be a step down the road to a European policing. Wainwright told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cWe value highly the contribution the UK makes to Europol\u2019s work as one of the leading contributors of intelligence and casework to the agency\u2019s databases and operations. We also believe that the active engagement of many British law enforcement agencies at Europol derives significant operational benefits for the UK in its fight against organised crime and terrorism. Europol looks forward to that close partnership continuing in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Two months after the vote to leave, a British minister involved in the Brexit process says that little can be said, \u201cbecause we still have to decide what Brexit means\u201d. A cabinet minister insists that the prime minister wants \u201cas much of the single market as possible\u201d. But Grant argues that membership looks out of the question because it would mean accepting free movement and paying into the EU budget, which would be politically impossible.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s vote to leave has not ended the Tory splits over Europe but merely highlighted battles to come between the Brexit purists and the Brexit pragmatists who want a soft exit. New Tory groups are forming to hold the government to the Brexit promise, while ministers try to devise a plan that will pass through parliament. If anyone has sleepless nights over Europe over the next months and years, it will be Boris Johnson and his government colleagues charged with deciding what Brexit will actually involve.</p> <h2>THE WAY AHEAD</h2> <p><strong>24 September Result of Labour leadership contest</strong></p> <p>Will Jeremy Corbyn, who has ruled out a second referendum, or Owen Smith, who wants one, win the day?</p> <p><strong>2-5 October Tory party conference</strong></p> <p>Theresa May will be under pressure to reveal more detail on Brexit plans as hardline \u201couters\u201d insist on a total break.</p> <p><strong>February 2017 Likely date for UK to trigger article 50</strong></p> <p>Clock starts ticking on two-year negotiation.</p> <p><strong>Mid-2017 Budget talks</strong></p> <p>EU officials begin preliminary talks on new seven-year EU budget.

He found evidence that a hardcore group of prisoners were involved in \u201cproselytising behaviour\u201d among the 12,500 Muslim inmates in England and Wales.</p> <p>The announcement comes after Anjem Choudary, one of the most notorious hate preachers living in Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/16/anjem-choudary-convicted-of-supporting-islamic-state\" title=\"\">was found guilty </a>at the Old Bailey of supporting Islamic State.</p> <p>After avoiding arrest for years, Choudary, 49, was convicted after jurors heard he had sworn an oath of allegiance to Isis. He also has links to one of Lee Rigby\u2019s killers, Michael Adebolajo, and the Islamist militant Omar Bakri Muhammad, and he urged followers to support Isis in a series of talks broadcast on YouTube.</p> <p>Choudary and his co-defendant, Mohammed Rahman, 33, told their supporters to obey Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Isis leader, and to travel to Syria to support Isis, the court heard. Choudray and Rahman face up to 10 years in jail for inviting support for a proscribed organisation.</p> <p>In the mid-1980s, Choudary and Bakri founded al-Muhajiroun, a shadowy network that promoted a hard-line version of Islam, calling for sharia law in the UK. It also cheered the 9/11 attacks, eventually leading to it being proscribed in 2010 under legislation outlawing the \u201cglorification\u201d of terrorism. The two men were convicted in July but the details were only made public last week.</p> <p>Acheson has said the review looked at dispersing extremists throughout the prison population. He and his team visited Maghaberry prison\u2019s Roe House, the \u201cprison within a prison\u201d that holds some of Northern Ireland\u2019s most high-profile terrorists, and prisons in the Netherlands, France and Spain, where jihadi prisoners are segregated.</p>",
  "<p>Woolsery in north Devon has all the features that might be expected of the present-day British village: towering hedgerows bordering winding lanes, tidy culs-de-sac bearing regimented rows of bungalows and, in the centre of the village, the medieval church, the empty listed building and the boarded-up pub.</p> <p>Sonia Hamilton, vice-chairwoman of the parish council, gestures at the listed building, known as the Manor House. \u201cThe state of that and the pub was depressing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>On this blustery August day, however, there are signs of change. Workers in hard hats mill around, hoardings are about to go up around the Manor House and the dilapidated pub is sheathed in tarpaulin. Last week planning permission was granted to convert the Manor House into a 19-room hotel, while restoration of the Farmers Arms pub to something approaching its former glory is due to be completed by the end of next year.</p> <p>For unlike other villages across the country facing the plight of dwindling shops and services, coupled with declining populations and rising house prices, Woolsery (also known as Woolfardisworthy) is the unlikely beneficiary of the largesse, coupled with some business savvy, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/02/bebo-founder-buys-back-site\">Michael Birch</a>, a laidback tech entrepreneur who lives in San Francisco.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"122920da12bdc3a39368c37430a11e18473d2708\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/122920da12bdc3a39368c37430a11e18473d2708/27_59_567_340/500.jpg\" alt=\"Michael and Xochi Birch, founders of Bebo.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael and Xochi Birch, founders of Bebo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Birch, who with his wife Xochi founded and then sold the social networking site <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/feb/13/bebo-michael-birch-more-failures-than-successes\">Bebo</a>, was born in Cambridgeshire but spent much of his childhood visiting relations in Woolsery, and there are members of six generations of his family buried in the churchyard. He was alerted to the village\u2019s plight by his sister, Hilary, and decided to spend some of the \u00a3300m nest egg generated by the sale of Bebo on preserving the village.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is madness, of course, but he knows his pubs,\u201d said Hamilton, who set up an action group with her husband to save the pub. Birch has professed to having fond childhood memories of the Farmers Arms, and bought the interior of an English pub and transplanted it to a club he set up in San Francisco. The irony of someone who made his fortune by creating a virtual social space choosing to invest that money in a physical social space goes unremarked.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been good to his word, and everything he\u2019s said he would do he\u2019s come through and done it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s spent a heck of a lot of money on it. He could become the local squire, I suppose, but it comes down to his personality and that\u2019s not really him. He\u2019s not coming here to lord it over us.\u201d</p> <p>Birch also bought the fish and chip shop next to the pub, where manager Jay Oyarzabal enthused about working for him. \u201cThis is the spearhead of the operation,\u201d said Oyarzabal, standing behind the counter before a blackboard offering fresh fish from nearby Ilfracombe and pulled pork hotdogs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like working for a company,\u201d said Oyarzabal. \u201cIt\u2019s like family. I don\u2019t have to turn a profit here. That\u2019s not Michael\u2019s thing. We break even. What he cares about is having it for the village.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been blown up with people saying he\u2019s the saviour of the broken village. The village is lovely as it is, but we\u2019re incredibly lucky. I don\u2019t think that anyone but a multimillionaire could do what he\u2019s doing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa124219b8f291ac5c91b03f73832358acdfb0cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa124219b8f291ac5c91b03f73832358acdfb0cf/0_33_611_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Farmers Arms in its heyday.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Farmers Arms in its heyday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next door, in the village shop, owner Andy Fryatt said that he had already seen the benefits of Birch\u2019s activities. \u201cThe guys working on the site come in here to get bits and pieces, then the new businesses in the village will create jobs, there will be an impact on house prices, the whole package. There have been several remarks about dying villages that have put people\u2019s backs up. In the centre of the village this shop was last man standing. We\u2019ve been keeping the heart of the village beating. Now there\u2019s going to be someone else.\u201d</p> <p>He is another unusual figure in the village\u2019s atypical story. While 200-300 village shops close every year, Fryatt, despite not having a background in retail, runs a thriving business.</p> <p>\u201cVillage retail has been in long-term decline for more than 20 years,\u201d said Kenneth Parsons, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.ruralshops.org.uk/contact-us/\">Rural Shops Alliance</a>. \u201cIn the past you could be an amateur but now customers don\u2019t take prisoners; they expect high standards, supermarket-style standards.\u201d</p> <p>Others point to transport and housing as causes of the decline of many villages, and even Hamilton admitted that one potential downside to Birch\u2019s investment could be an increase in house prices.</p> <p>\u201cIt is great to see someone so clearly attached to the village aiming to give it a new lease of life, and restoring places at the centre of the community,\u201d said Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.cpre.org.uk/\">Campaign to Protect Rural England</a>.</p> <p>Referring to research showing that only one in 10 rural houses were affordable to the local population, he said: \u201cThis of course has a knock-on effect. Many local people are unable to afford to stay and patronise the pub or shop, or send their children to the local school. Too many villages are being sealed off. Villages should be beautiful, but they must be vibrant communities full of life too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"501ad8cd293b296db90fe098913a707651b8c00c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/501ad8cd293b296db90fe098913a707651b8c00c/0_79_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Manor House in Woolsery, which will be turned into a hotel.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Manor House in Woolsery, which will be turned into a hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hamilton, standing next to what will become a much-needed village green linking the school to the church, pondered the fate of Woolsery. \u201cIs it a village in decline? As a community I don\u2019t think it is, but the pub is a real centre. At the moment we\u2019re spread to the four corners. It\u2019s nice seeing it coming back to life.\u201d</p> <p>Her thoughts are given an academic sheen by a <a href=\"https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/2014/10/the-busy-village-pub-is-a-sign-of-thriving-rural-community/\">study into the contribution of local pubs</a> to rural communities published at the end of 2014 by Northumbria University in Newcastle. \u201cThe English rural pub is not simply a place for drink, it has become a hub for the community\u2019s infrastructure offering events, support and friendship,\u201d the report found. \u201cPubs function as physical hubs which foster engagement and involvement among the community, as well as creating jobs for locals and local suppliers.\u201d</p> <p>Carol Bonnefin, who has lived in Woolsery for more than 30 years, was more straightforward. \u201cWhat we need is a pub, and we need it now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Farmers Arms was somewhere you could go and have a pint. Tuesday evening was bell-ringing. You could do that and then go in the pub. It was the centre of the village. They used to hold parish council meetings upstairs, and the assizes.\u201d</p> <p>Hilary Birch, the entrepreneur\u2019s sister, agreed that the value of the pub and the hotel were greater than mere bricks and mortar. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to have these community buildings in a village,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s where people get a sense of community and of belonging.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 August 2016 to add the other name of the village, Woolfardisworthy.<br></p>",
  "<p>The world moves on. Ducking stools don\u2019t actually work all that well. Children have nimble little fingers and fit easily up chimneys but they\u2019ve been more or less successfully rebranded: we generally try not to kill or maim them these days \u2013 unless they\u2019re foreign, of course. And we have given up inflicting our imperialist ambitions on unwitting nations.</p> <p>The days of waltzing into some country and saddling its mountains and lakes with the names of faceless bureaucrats \u2013 or surveyors from Crickhowell, in the case of George Everest \u2013 have gone. Now, it turns out, we waltz into countries and saddle them with the names of luxury watches.</p> <p>Or so it was recently announced. A team of British climbers had \u201cconquered\u201d a previously unclimbed peak in Kyrgyzstan in an \u201cexhilarating expedition\u201d. And they had named it after their sponsor. Welcome, world, to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.christopherward.co.uk/blog/\" title=\"\">Mount Trident</a>\u201d \u2013 so-called \u201cafter British watch brand Christopher Ward\u2019s hero watch collection\u201d.</p> <p>The fact that there is already a Mount Trident \u2013 in Antarctica \u2013 and that the last notable naming of a mountain in Kyrgyzstan was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12113463\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin Peak</a> appears to be neither here nor there. And let us not even start on what a \u201chero watch collection\u201d may or may not be. It\u2019s not even the first mountain that the company has slapped its corporate logo on. The same team went to Tajikistan in 2013 and achieved a first ascent of what is now \u201cMount Christopher Ward\u201d.</p> <p>But maybe the surprising thing is not that there is nothing in the world left that a company won\u2019t try and commercialise, it\u2019s that others haven\u2019t yet jumped on the same bandwagon. Kyrgyzstan alone has dozens of unclimbed peaks all just sitting there waiting for their corporate branding. Where is Mount Sports Direct? Peak Primark? When oh when will we have Mount Poundworld?</p> <p>Good luck to the climbers. A nice bunch of intrepid young men, by all accounts, who just want to climb mountains. But at what cost? These are some of the most remote and beautiful places left on Earth. A true wilderness where few people have ever been, named now and for ever more as an advert for a \u00a3730 watch. It\u2019s one things to name your mountains after surveyors and strongman presidents, but to turn them into commercials for overpriced consumer goods is surely in another category.</p> <p>Mountains have always reflected our own world back at us: our imperial ambitions, our national pride, our xenophobic tendencies. The \u201cconquering\u201d of Everest by a British expedition is widely seen as the crowning moment of the age of empire: the news reached England on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s coronation. But now it\u2019s just money. Our mountains are us: venal, commercial, exploited for profit. The natural world is there for the picking, to be commercialised and commodified and then sold back to us. Adventures have to be Instagramable, experiences must look good on Facebook. Wilderness is there to be \u201cconquered\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible I\u2019m just upset because Theresa May has taken my favourite pastime \u2013 walking up hills \u2013 and turned it Tory. It was bad enough when Boris and Cameron made a Conservative landgrab for cycling. But you can go outdoors without a pair of telescopic walking poles, a sensible polo shirt and a desire to exit the European Union, you really can. Let Mount Trident inspire you to not buy a \u00a3730 watch. To not buy anything \u2013 even telescopic walking poles. It\u2019s perfectly possible to go for a hike without dressing like a German lady trucker \u2013 though I generally do \u2013 but it\u2019s a wonderful world out there, whatever.</p> <h2>Now say sorry like you mean it, Ryan</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6e12f162b95ce43171da7ffe880d4ceaa2ee50d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6e12f162b95ce43171da7ffe880d4ceaa2ee50d/0_122_2340_1404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US swimmer Ryan Lochte after the men\u2019s 4x200-metre freestyle heat in Rio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US swimmer Ryan Lochte after the men\u2019s 4x200-metre freestyle heat in Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Sohn/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so, congratulations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/swimmer-reality-tv-star-diplomatic-incident-ryan-lochte\" title=\"\">Ryan Lochte</a> for this year\u2019s masterclass in How to Apologise Like a Dick.

  "<p>Robert De Niro and his business partners, BD Hotels, are to open a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/18/robert-de-niro-gets-go-ahead-to-open-london-hotel\" title=\"\">\u201cluxury boutique\u201d </a>hotel in London\u2019s Covent Garden. Currently, the average price for a room in the capital is \u00a3135 and rising because today\u2019s hotel stay, with more than 80% occupancy, is, as the jargon goes, an experiential luxury. \u201cBD\u201d is Richard Born and Ira Drukier, formerly in engineering and medicine; they are now billionaires and the biggest owners of boutique hotels in New York. \u201cThe aesthetic nature of the hotel business has evolved slowly,\u201d Drukier said in an interview last year. \u201cThey have become stylised\u2026 hotels are more than just a bed and water.\u201d And then some. Possibly Drukier was referring to the swimming pool that De Niro \u201chelped to implement\u201d in the BD Greenwich Hotel framed with beams from a centuries-old Japanese farmhouse.</p> <p>One of the many follies of uber-affluence is that people will pay hugely to grope their way around the black-painted lobby of a dimly lit designer hotel, manned by undertaker-suited staff, sphinx-like, snooty and clothed to be indistinguishable from the decor. Inevitably, too, the lavatories are marked by obscure post-modern hieroglyphics and the cost of a glass of water is heading to the hourly rate of the London living wage (\u00a39.40 and in the dreams of many of the abysmally paid hotel staff who carry the cases, clean rooms, stock the bars, cook and work as below-stairs porters.)</p> <p>In the classic 1995 Martin Scorsese film <em>Casino</em>, Robert De Niro plays Sam \u201cAce\u201d Rothstein, a mafia associate, sent in to run a crooked Las Vegas gambling joint. At one point, he says: \u201cThere are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way and the way I do it.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, at the Ludlow in New York, , a non-unionised BD hotel (where De Niro is not involved), the management showed the way it prefers to do it. It allegedly engaged in tactics to persuade its staff not to vote in favour of joining the strong New York union, the Hotel Trades Council (HTC). Hints were made that staff would be sacked if they defied management\u2019s wishes. Nevertheless, the staff voted 97% in favour.</p> <p>In New York, a large number of hotels are unionised. HTC has 32,000 members including those working in other BD hotels. Ludlow staff, pre-HTC, earned around $14 (\u00a311) an hour. In contrast, staff in HTC hotels can earn up to $27 an hour plus free family medical insurance, pensions, proper holiday pay and a guaranteed working week. In London, is that going to be the way? Possibly not. A report published on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hotelworkersunite\" title=\"\">Unethical London, drawn up by the Unite Hotel Workers branch</a>, rightly charges that, in London, global hotel chains harass, block and intimidate to stop collective union action, contrary to global employment agreements. In a predominantly non-unionised climate, tips \u2013 12% to 15% of bills \u2013 are \u201creallocated\u201d and pay is poor.</p> <p>Employees are pressured to work extra time without pay and complaints or any sign of union interest are too often dealt with by a cut in shifts on zero-hours contracts or by awarding the complainer with extra rooms to clean. Staff are, in many cases, disrespected and disregarded; ill, depressed and broke. All of which, the report says,&#xa0;makes, \u201cLondon one of the most unethical tourist destinations in the world\u201d \u2013 a highly profitable one.</p> <p>Hotel and tourism is the fourth largest employer in the country. By 2025, tourism is predicted to be a \u00a3257.4bn industry. It is shameful that collective action and the right to join a trade union are blocked, allowing exploitation and fear to flourish. Over the past several decades, what has happened in hospitality and tourism offers in miniature a picture of general developments in employment. In the 1940s, Conrad Hilton may have had his flaws but it was clear who was accountable. His name was on the business. Now, hedge funds and financiers are the obscure investors and, as the Unite report points out, hotel buildings are sold, brands are franchised and major hotels are atomised with different services outsourced, each new contract driving wages and conditions down further. A process, which, without collective action, kills the spirit of the hardest workers.</p> <p>Seventy per cent of UK hotel employees are immigrants. Post Brexit, if they go, who will replace them? The Unite report makes demands that are modest \u2013 a wage on which you can live; safe, secure work; guaranteed hours every week; training opportunities and a collective voice and union representation. That these rights are still denied demonstrates how successive governments, Labour included, have accepted that, in the words of social historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/selina-todd\" title=\"\">Selina Todd</a>, \u201cprofit making and the people\u2019s welfare [are] ultimately irreconcilable\u201d.</p> <p>In New York, in addition to trade unionism, collectivism has channelled into consumer clout. A kitemark operates so that you know that the hotel you choose has a fair policy on wages and conditions; not too difficult for TripAdvisor et al to add to its criteria? It works for fair trade, so why not for many of the millions labouring in hotel and tourism? Or don\u2019t we care enough?</p> <p>Today, perhaps, we are all travellers, nomads not just geographically but politically, too. In a recent column in the<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/column/david-brooks\" title=\"\"><em> New York Times</em>, David Brooks</a> suggested that young people, reared on individualism, privacy and the power of the dollar, preferred the community and class solidarity of the Bernie Sanders campaign to the \u201cboomer autonomy\u201d of Hillary Clinton. Brooks quotes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/26/tribe-homecoming-belonging-review-sebastian-junger-joanna-bourke\" title=\"\">Sebastian Junger\u2019s book, <em>Tribe</em></a>, in which he describes how 18th-century colonials, captured by Native Americans, when freed, often chose to return to the materially poorer life for a society of communal living. Junger writes: \u201cThey would have practised extremely close and involved childcare. They would have done almost everything in the company of others.\u201d</p> <p>Money talks, but what also has a powerful eloquence is empathy and the determination to look out for each other. Paradoxically, individual choice can add up to a collective message. And with a kitemark system in operation, this could inform your next choice of hotel.</p>",
  "<p>In the middle of the 20th century, the conservative political philosopher Michael Oakeshott gave one of the most sublime accounts of the value of a university education ever written. It is worth quoting at length from <a href=\"https://www.msudenver.edu/media/content/facultyevaltaskforce/sources/oakeshotttheideaofauniversity.pdf\" title=\"\">The Idea of a University, </a>which was published in 1950. Partly because of the beauty and humanity of the prose, but also because you just don\u2019t get thinking like this any more in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cThe characteristic gift of the university,\u201d writes Oakeshott, \u201cis the gift of an interval. Here is an opportunity to put aside the hot allegiances of youth without the necessity of at once acquiring new loyalties to take their place. Here is a break in the tyrannical course of irreparable events; a period in which to look around upon the world and upon oneself without the sense of an enemy at one\u2019s back or the insistent pressure to make up one\u2019s mind; a moment in which to taste the mystery without the necessity of seeking a solution. And all this, not in an intellectual vacuum, but surrounded by all the inherited learning and literature and experience of our civilisation\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The gift of an interval? One wonders what Oakeshott, who died in 1990, would have made of last week\u2019s coverage of A-level results day. This annual landmark is now treated not as a threshold to be crossed into a protected world of ideas, but as the starting gun in a debt-fuelled race for economic preferment in later life.</p> <p>A confusing barrage of income-related studies framed results day: the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk\" title=\"\">Institute for Fiscal Studies found</a> that the graduate salary \u201cpremium\u201d for degree holders has emerged unscathed from the huge expansion in numbers going to university.</p> <p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/13/quarter-of-graduates-are-low-earners\" title=\"\">the Longitudinal Education Outcomes</a> survey established that one in four graduates from 2004 was still earning far less than the average national wage, 10 years later.</p> <p>So is going to university \u2013 and emerging from it with upwards of \u00a340,000 worth of debt \u2013 really a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11387392/Universities-minister-Tuition-fees-cost-same-as-daily-cup-of-posh-coffee.html\" title=\"\">\u201cphenomenal investment\u201d, to quote Greg Clark</a>, the former Conservative minister for universities? A lot depends on where you go, another analysis revealed, also by the IFS. Gaining a qualification from a high-end Russell Group university is far likelier to bring financial reward in later life than one from what Alastair Campbell might describe as a \u201cbog-standard\u201d institution.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What a grimly utilitarian world we are bequeathing to future undergraduates</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Journalists last week duly focused on the battle for the top spots. On the BBC\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme, an understandably delighted young woman called Rebecca was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07p13h8\" title=\"\">interviewed</a> as she discovered she had scored a stellar three As. \u201cSo now you can go through clearing and get to a better university,\u201d the reporter told her (a process described as \u201ctrading up\u201d by university recruitment types).</p> <p>Fair enough, and hearty congratulations to Rebecca on the A grades, but why did no one think of asking her which course she hoped to study and why? Isn\u2019t that what this is supposed to be about?</p> <p>What a grimly utilitarian world we are bequeathing to future undergraduates. The dismal and mercantile discourse surrounding higher education in England and Wales should be a source of dismay to policymakers. It certainly is to the increasing numbers of students suffering debt-related stress in the era of sky-high tuition fees.</p> <p>Most arguments over the current state of our universities concern issues of access and inequality. When Oakeshott wrote The Idea of University, <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/participation-rates-now-we-are-50/2005873.article\" title=\"\">only 3.4% of young people went to such an institution</a>. That figure is now approaching 50%, and no one would advocate turning the clock back to the days when only a tiny elite entered the groves of academe.</p> <p>But the chosen method of expansion \u2013 replacing public funding of higher education with a system in which students pay, on average, the highest fees in the world \u2013 has turned a university education into a purely private good. In an increasingly fraught marketplace, a youthful buyer, looking for a return on his or her investment, confronts a needy seller who requires bums on campus seats. And the (metaphorical) cost of that approach is becoming steadily more apparent: a world that used to exist to promote learning for its own sake is now sold as a means to an end. As the universities minister, Jo Johnson, puts it: \u201cThere is no better way to improve your life chances than getting a good higher education.\u201d</p> <p>Where that might lead was vividly illustrated in an article appearing in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> on results day. The author enthusiastically envisioned a future in which \u201ca simple app showed what leavers\u2019 salaries were three, five and 10 years from graduation, for each degree category and university. Students would realise that it makes sense to study physics and mathematics at a top university rather than English at a mediocre one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMakes sense\u201d, presumably, in terms of \u201cvalue for money\u201d, a phrase that peppers Johnson\u2019s green paper on HE reform. But what about the value of reading and discussing, for example, James Joyce and developing a deepened and sophisticated love of literature? Unfortunately, one can only know the worth of that experience by experiencing it and such knowledge will never come in an app. It is, in any case, a different kind of value altogether.</p> <p>A university education is not a fridge, where the benefits are knowable in advance of purchase. Nor should it be treated like an investment in a hedge fund or shares, the advisability of which depends on an estimated financial return. It is, or should be, a transforming phase of life that equips you, as Oakeshott puts it, \u201cto look for some meaning in the things that have greatly moved mankind\u201d.</p> <p>Each academic year, thousands of students still discover the truth of that. But the way we are financing our universities \u2013 and the ways we are talking about what university is for \u2013 are in danger of changing the nature of what a modern university actually is. A society with our resources and ambitions should be capable of offering young people such as Rebecca the \u201cgift of an interval\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>In a few days, one of the world\u2019s largest cruise ships, the Crystal Serenity, will visit the tiny Inuit village of Ulukhaktok in northern Canada. Hundreds of passengers will be ferried to the little community, more than doubling its population of around 400. The Serenity will then raise anchor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/13/large-cruise-ship-voyage-arctic-ice-crystal-cruises\" title=\"\">head through the Northwest Passage</a> to visit several more Inuit settlements before sailing to Greenland and finally New York.</p> <p>It will be a massive undertaking, representing an almost tenfold increase in passenger numbers<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/us-canada-arctic-cruise-ship-titanic-emergency-training-coast-guard\" title=\"\"> taken through the Arctic on a single vessel </a>\u2013 and it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/30/my-arctic-journey-fragile-ecosystem-northwest-passage\" title=\"\">triggered considerable controversy</a> among Arctic experts. Inuit leaders fear that visits by giant cruise ships could overwhelm fragile communities, while others warn that the Arctic ecosystem, already suffering the effects of global warming, could be seriously damaged.</p> <p>\u201cThis is extinction tourism,\u201d said international law expert Professor Michael Byers, of the University of British Columbia. \u201cMaking this trip has only become possible because carbon emissions have so warmed the atmosphere that Arctic sea ice in summer is disappearing. The terrible irony is that this ship \u2013 which even has a helicopter for sightseeing and a huge staff-to-passenger ratio \u2013 has an enormous carbon footprint that is only going to make things even worse in the Arctic.\u201d</p> <p>The Serenity is by far the biggest cruise vessel to traverse the fabled Northwest Passage, whose exploration has claimed the lives of hundreds of seamen. The ship has a crew of 655 and carries 1,070 passengers, who have paid between \u00a319,000 and \u00a3120,000 for a voyage that Crystal Cruises says will take them on an \u201cintrepid adventure\u201d from Anchorage in Alaska to New York over 32 days.</p> <p>For its part, Crystal insists its clients will have to follow a strict code of conduct during shore visits, while the ship\u2019s air, water and rubbish discharges will be tightly controlled. Only low-sulphur fuel will be burned in the Serenity\u2019s engines, said a spokesman. The Serenity will be accompanied by the UK icebreaker the RSS Ernest Shackleton, he added.</p> <p>However, it is not the voyage that directly poses danger, Byers said. \u201cThis is a well-supported, carefully worked-out trip. I acknowledge that. The trouble is that it is going to open the door to mass tourism in the high Arctic and many other operators \u2013 who could easily turn out to be far less scrupulous or painstaking \u2013 will be eyeing it up for major operations. That could end in disaster. \u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/ice-scientists-arctic-ice-disappearing-reduce-emissions-peter-wadhams\">Time to listen to the ice scientists about the Arctic death spiral</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This point was backed by Okalik Eegeesiak, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council. \u201cFar too many people will be descending suddenly into these communities and bringing far too much garbage with them,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThese places lack the infrastructure and the training to deal with the incredible numbers of people that will start arriving on these boats.\u201d Apart from Ulukhaktok, the Serenity is also scheduled to visit the Inuit communities of Pond Inlet, Cambridge Bay and Sisimiut.</p> <p>Eegeesiak added that the Inuit were already experiencing problems thanks to global warming. As sea ice disappears, this removes a highway on which locals can ride their snowmobiles and dog sleds to hunt and visit friends. Disappearing ice means increasing fragmentation of communities and limits the ability of people to hunt, a problem that is only likely to worsen as the region\u2019s shrinking ice-cap opens it up to mining, oil drilling, tourism and more shipping.</p> <p>In addition, there is the question of food. The Inuit have no farms and rely on what they can catch from the ice and water around them for sustenance. But this food chain is under threat. Algae grows on the underside of sea ice and is eaten by krill, which is then eaten by Arctic cod, which in turn is eaten by seals and finally polar bears. However, if the bottom rung of this food chain disappears because sea ice is melting, then all sorts of unintended consequences could soon be realised, marine biologists have warned. Mass tourism is only going to make this worse, they add.</p> <p>This point was stressed by Eegeesiak. \u201cIt is not just the communities we need to worry about when these great boats arrive but all the wildlife of the region,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Earlier this month Crystal announced that it was already taking bookings for a similar 32-day cruise through the Northwest Passage for 2017. In addition, it revealed it has ordered construction of \u201cthe world\u2019s first purpose-built polar class megayacht, the Crystal Endeavour\u201d. The ship \u2013 which will cruise exclusively in the Arctic and Antarctic \u2013 will carry underwater scooters to allow passengers to experience their own subsea exploration and will be fitted with some of the largest bedroom suites ever put in a cruise ship. \u201cThis megayacht will change the game entirely \u2013 the possibilities for expedition travellers will be virtually limitless,\u201d said Crystal president Edie Rodriguez.</p> <p>But such an opening up of the Arctic to tourism dismays Byers. \u201cOne big ship is perhaps manageable but five or six is tempting disaster. Glaciers are crumbling more and more up there and we are getting more and more icebergs in the water.</p> <p>\u201cIf a ship carrying 3,000 passengers hits one of those you could be in real trouble. This is an incredibly remote region. It could take two days to get search-and-rescue helicopters up there. Yet an accident like that is almost inevitable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Nursing glasses of champagne and grazing on canap\u00e9s, around 1,000 guests gathered one evening last month at London\u2019s Science Museum for a lavish reception costing \u00a3105 a head.</p> <p>As they swapped business cards and exchanged small talk, the multicultural crowd was oblivious to the small group of protesters chanting and waving placards outside. Instead they were intent on laying the groundwork for their industry\u2019s premier international trade fair, which was starting the next day.</p> <p>The Farnborough International Airshow is a hugely popular event with the public. Featuring drones, celebrity guests, simulators and flypasts, it is considered a great day out for families. But behind the scenes Farnborough doubles as a giant trade show for the world\u2019s arms manufacturers.</p> <p>About 100,000 people working in the defence sector attend the event which is run by UKTI DSO, the government\u2019s arms exports promotional division, and which this year attracted 80 military delegations and was formally opened by David Cameron, then still prime minister.</p> <p>Among those sponsoring the fair was the US defence contractor Raytheon, which claims to be \u201cthe world\u2019s premier missile maker\u201d.</p> <p>Raytheon\u2019s factories in Essex and Scotland produce the Paveway IV guided bomb which, according to its manufacturer, has been \u201cput to the test in every major conflict\u201d and proved itself \u201ctime and again, as the weapon of choice by the end users\u201d.</p> <p>One enthusiastic end user is Saudi Arabia, now the UK defence sector\u2019s biggest customer, having agreed orders for \u00a33.5bn of military hardware since the start of 2015. Saudi Arabia\u2019s buying spree has been prompted, at least partially, by its intervention in neighbouring Yemen, where a coalition led by Riyadh is battling Houthi Shia rebels, backed by Iran, who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/21/yemens-western-backed-president-flees-house-arrest-in-sanaa\">forced the country\u2019s president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to flee</a>. For months, evidence has been emerging from the rubble of Yemen that UK-manufactured weapons \u2013 including Paveway bombs \u2013 have been used in the campaign.</p> <p>At the start of this year investigators from<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/10/bombing-businesses/saudi-coalition-airstrikes-yemens-civilian-economic-structures\"> Human Rights Watch attended the sites of two bombing targets</a> and found evidence that UK-manufactured weaponry \u2013 in one case a bomb, in the other a laser guidance kit \u2013 had been deployed. The nature of the targets \u2013 a chamber of commerce and a warehouse \u2013 appear to corroborate claims that the Saudis are targeting civilian infrastructure, a breach of international human rights law.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that the Saudis have used these weapons in Yemen: Human Rights Watch has determined that they have been used unlawfully and that the weapons used in the strikes were UK-produced,\u201d said Kristine Beckerle of Human Rights Watch. The organisation has become so frustrated by the government\u2019s refusal to acknowledge how UK weapons are being deployed in Yemen that it is releasing a video highlighting the impact they are having on a conflict in which at least 6,000 people have died.</p> <p>However, in statements to parliament the Foreign Office has insisted that \u201cthe MOD assessment is that the Saudi-led coalition is not targeting civilians\u201d, and that \u201cthere has not been a breach of IHL [international humanitarian law] by the coalition\u201d. Saudi Arabia, too, denies claims that its military coalition is targeting civilian sites. But the denials from both camps are unravelling.</p> <p>On the final day of the last parliamentary session, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Lords/2016-07-21/HLWS120/\">Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood was forced to issue no fewer than six corrections to statements and answers given about the conflict.</a> The Foreign Office, Ellwood conceded, had been \u201cunable to assess that there has been breach of IHL by the Saudi-led coalition\u201d.</p> <p>Having corrected its statements to parliament, the government is now under pressure to acknowledge that it has also misled the high court in relation to a case being brought against it by the pressure group Campaign Against Arms Trade, which accuses it of failing to ensure that arms exports to Saudi Arabia are not in breach of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>\u201cThe corrections are staggering,\u201d said Andrew Smith of the campaign. \u201cAt best the government has been extremely negligent and careless, and at worst it has acted to mislead parliament and the court. Either way it has serious questions to answer and must make clear what it will do to ensure this never happens again. The stakes could not be higher: UK fighter jets are flying over Yemen and people are dying from UK bombs.\u201d</p> <p>The Saudis, too, now admit mistakes. A commission set up by the kingdom has concluded that the coalition was guilty of \u201cmistakenly\u201d hitting a residential compound in the Red Sea port city of Mokha \u2013 an incident in which at least 65 civilians died. It also acknowledged that the coalition was responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/saudi-led-air-strike-yemen-hospital-kills-at-least-seven\">airstrikes on a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders</a>, which it claims was being used as a rebel hideout.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9358fd01b07cd65f284fa712c495b80e192f6f50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9358fd01b07cd65f284fa712c495b80e192f6f50/0_223_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smoke rises from a food factory in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoke rises from a food factory in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, reportedly targeted by jets from Saudi-led coalition forces earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yahya Arhab/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Tom Brake, said the UK needed to rethink its policy on Saudi arms exports. \u201cThere is such an overwhelming body of evidence that the Saudis have committed breaches of international humanitarian law in Yemen that the UK government can no longer rely on their rather weak reassurances, and should instead initiate their own review to confirm, in my view, that there have been breaches which would require them to stop arms sales to Saudi.\u201d</p> <p>But this would be a disaster for the British defence sector, where business is booming. Newly published official figures reveal that the UK won defence orders worth \u00a37.7bn last year. It now has about 12% of the global defence export market and, over the last decade, has shored up its position as the second largest arms exporter in the world.</p> <p>There is still much to play for. The government\u2019s own figures suggest that the global defence export market in 2015 was worth a fraction under $100bn, a 17% increase on 2014.</p> <p>As the market has expanded, successive governments have gone to extraordinary lengths to promote the sector. Tony Blair intervened to prevent an investigation into arms exports to Riyadh; Cameron assiduously courted Saudi royalty; earlier this year the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, led a UK delegation to Qatar to promote sales of the Eurofighter jet.</p> <p>The Middle East is considered by the government to be a priority market. Two-thirds of all arms exports go to the region. In the last two years the UK has agreed arms deals worth \u00a3388m with the United Arab Emirates, \u00a3170m with Qatar, \u00a3120m with Oman and \u00a324m with Bahrain.</p> <p>Other countries with questionable human rights records have also become major customers. In the last three years the UK has sold \u00a3450m of arms to Turkey, despite its increasing authoritarianism and political instability, and \u00a3116m of weaponry to Egypt, despite its recent coup and worsening human rights situation. It has also signed major contracts to supply missiles to Malaysia and Thailand.</p> <p>Brake suggested that the government\u2019s failure to monitor the impact UK weapons were having in Yemen undermined any assurances it could give that they were not being used elsewhere in breach of international human rights laws. \u201cIf similar breaches of IHL involving the use of UK arms in another theatre of conflict occurred, there is no reason to believe that the UK government would adopt a more proactive stance in relation to those breaches.\u201d</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman defended Britain\u2019s position. She said the UK had \u201cone of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world\u201d and could revoke licences quickly if circumstances changed, as had happened in the cases of Libya and Yemen.</p> <p>\u201cThe key test for our continued arms exports to Saudi Arabia in relation to international humanitarian law is whether there is a clear risk that those weapons might be used in a serious violation of IHL,\u201d she said. \u201cThe situation is kept under careful and continual review.\u201d</p> <p>But Smith questioned the government\u2019s assurances. \u201cThe arms trade could not function without the active support and participation of the UK government,\u201d he said. \u201cTime and again it has shown that it will stretch to any length, and sink to any low, in order to promote arms sales to some of the most repressive regimes in the world.\u201d</p> <h2>KEY CLIENTS FOR UK ARMS</h2> <p><strong>Israel</strong><br>The UK licensed \u00a382m of arms to Israel while David Cameron was in office. The government acknowledged UK arms had \u201calmost certainly\u201d been used in bombarding Gaza in 2009, in a conflict that saw both sides accused of war crimes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1a9ae1f84641b57f8e22a8279646f03e51db60d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1a9ae1f84641b57f8e22a8279646f03e51db60d/0_82_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron presided over \u00a382m of arms sales to Israel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Turkey</strong><br>In the last three years the UK has licensed to Ankara almost \u00a3450m of arms, including components for military aircraft, helicopters and targeting equipment.

  "<p>How refreshing to see informed comment on planners and the British planning system (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/14/planning-policy-give-planners-more-powers\" title=\"\">\u201cPlanners could build a better Britain \u2013 given the chance\u201d</a>, Comment). Town and country planning in this country has, as Rowan Moore says, since 2010 been the subject of constant \u201creforms\u201d that are not reforms at all. Reforms are changes that seek improvement. What we have seen are changes that stem from a doctrinaire hostility to democratic public control.</p> <p>There are many instances where we have seen this hostility and it has been coupled with an avoidance of the evidence. We started with Eric Pickles, then secretary of state at the DCLG, dismissing the regional strategies as \u201cSoviet style\u201d policies, this from a politician who was to go on to promote the \u201cbedroom tax\u201d, an instrument of policy worthy of Stalin himself.</p> <p>But the most revealing comment came anonymously from within the DCLG, again in the early days of the coalition, when, on the need to improve the supply of new housing, we were told: \u201cThe only thing the planning system has built is resentment.\u201d This when the department\u2019s own statistics so vividly demonstrate how the postwar record for house completions came in the 1960s with every scheme for the delivery of the homes coming through our planning system.</p> <p>There is, indeed, every immediate need to ensure a higher level of new house building, but the problem is a lack of political will to do so and, moreover, to do it well through, among other measures, good planning practice.<br><strong>John Dean</strong><br>Leicester</p> <p>I totally agree that \u201cplanners could build a better Britain\u201d and that the common perception of them is as \u201cfaceless bureaucrats\u201d, \u201cgrey\u201d, \u201cputting the brakes on prosperity, growth and freedom of choice\u201d.</p> <p>But Rowan Moore\u2019s ire is largely misdirected. I am a member of the Royal Town Planning Institute and point to three major culprits holding back planners\u2019 creative tendencies. First is the government and its national planning policy framework (NPPF); although it purports to promote \u201csustainable development\u201d, it\u2019s a charter for developers to gain maximum return and to hell with delivering desperately needed affordable homes. Second are local councillors \u2013 they make many of the planning decisions,not the planning officers who advise them. Third is government\u2019s localism agenda, encouraging people to prepare their own neighbourhood plans, only to have them gutted by planning policies, and their guardians, higher up the chain of decision-making. As Moore concludes: \u201cGood planning gives you places where people actually want to live.\u201d Let planners plan!<br><strong>James Derounian</strong><br>Cheltenham</p> <p>In my experience, planners deserve big hugs due to the hard time they have controlling aggressive developers. Many pieces of land selected by developers for housing lie on the outskirts of existing villages or towns. A typical developer submits an outline application that raises many objections and reveals areas of concern. The planning authority and elected councillors are then quite likely to refuse permission.</p> <p>The developer then returns with amended plans and a full application. The authority may well refuse permission again and for good reasons.</p> <p>The developer then appeals and brings along his legal team, headed by a barrister to present his case to a government inspector at a public hearing. The council and residents probably have limited funds, so are in some difficulty, and the developer has a good chance of getting his way. This is how developers are really in charge of what\u2019s being built and not the planners. I suggest we give planners greater powers to encourage design and development of entirely new villages with proper infrastructure rather than ruin existing ones by adding more and more, bit by bit.<br><strong>Mike Haywood</strong><br>Cheltenham</p>",

Much of this has to do with the amazing accomplishments of the British athletes, who have recorded their most dominant performances ever in an overseas Olympics. More than 10 million people watched the gymnast Max Whitlock win his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/max-whitlock-profile-olympic-gold-gymnastics-rio-2016\" title=\"\">second gold medal</a> last Sunday, and an astonishing 11.1 million tuned in to BBC1 at 11pm on Tuesday to see cyclist Jason Kenny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/jason-kenny-wins-dramatic-keirin-for-sixth-olympic-gold\" title=\"\">win the men\u2019s keirin</a>. There have been record ratings for BBC4, as well.</p> <p>If you went off to bed instead, every morning was like Santa had visited overnight, with a new clutch of medals to celebrate. Sport is often a form of escapism and Britain has rarely craved distractions more than now. Uncertainty about Brexit has left everyone, even the \u201cwinners\u201d, bruised and disillusioned. The Labour party seems intent on implosion, obliged to choose between two flawed candidates. Terrorist attacks are growing more shocking, depressingly frequent and closer to home. Success in the Olympics hasn\u2019t made these problems disappear, but it has offered a much-needed summer holiday from them.</p> <p>The old maxim is that it is better to watch sport live, in the round. In Rio, though, that might not always be the case. Everyone over in Brazil agrees that the conditions have been challenging. The Jo\u00e3o Havelange stadium, the venue for the athletics, is dilapidated, with few working lifts or toilets. Traffic in the city has been gridlocked, so bad that some members of the Dutch team have taken to commuting by bicycle. The attendance at many events has been woeful and the atmosphere embarrassingly nonexistent. Around 280,000 free tickets were given to schoolchildren in Brazil, but more than half of these were never used. It has been reported that bars show Brazil\u2019s football matches on TV but otherwise boycott coverage of the Olympics.</p> <p>This, in many ways, is sad: Brazil is in danger of missing an excellent Games. Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps, two untouchable Olympians, have signed off with, respectively, an irrepressible swagger and the meme-perfect <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/phelpsface?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\" title=\"\">#PhelpsFace.</a></p> <p>But just as thrilling were the new stars. There was a fantastic moment when Bolt, in the bowels of the stadium, was caught on camera reacting to Wayde van Niekerk\u2019s ridiculous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/wayde-van-niekerk-olympic-gold-400m-world-record\" title=\"\">world-record victory in the 400m</a>. His hands go to his mouth, he spins on his heels, he\u2019s genuinely flabbergasted. A metaphorical baton was passed over right then. Gymnast Simone Biles lived up to her impossible pre-Games billing. And is there a more beguiling and hypnotic sight than watching Katie Ledecky swim freestyle?</p> <p>It\u2019s true that much of the coverage has verged on hyperbolic, even jingoistic. Sometimes it feels we\u2019re more likely to hear news of a Brit finishing seventh than about the actual winner of an event. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/olympics-hysteria-britain-turned-soviet-team-gb\" title=\"\">Simon Jenkins in the <em>Guardian</em></a> argued that we have been too eagerly panting to anoint \u201cheroes\u201d and compared the British pursuit of medals \u2013 which comes at the taxpayer\u2019s expense, of course \u2013 to the ideological oneupmanship of the Soviet bloc nations during the cold war. The BBC\u2019s reporting was, he felt, comparable to \u201ca British National party awayday\u201d.</p> <p>And yet a redeeming feature of the Games has been how genuine and endearing the winners often seem to be \u2013 certainly in contrast to, say, the Premier League footballers we have much greater exposure to. Phelps may have had a pre-Games net worth of around \u00a340m, but in the main these athletes are not overindulged poodles. Mostly they are unknown and unheralded for all but a couple of weeks every four years. Even Kenny \u2013 now equal with Chris Hoy as Britain\u2019s most decorated Olympian, with six golds and a silver \u2013 admitted before the Games that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/olympics/2016/07/26/rio-olympics-2016-jason-kenny-says-hes-not-pretty-enough-to-land/\" title=\"\">he didn\u2019t have a personal sponsor because he wasn\u2019t \u201cpretty\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The success of British athletes has, it should be noted, not been universally applauded. The sniping has been loudest at the velodrome, where Team GB won six golds, four silvers and a bronze. French, German and Australian rivals have pulled up short of outright accusations of cheating, but only just. \u201cThey were cannon fodder when you look at the last few years,\u201d said Germany\u2019s Kristina Vogel, who actually did beat a British competitor to win gold so can\u2019t be accused of sour grapes. She added: \u201cIt is all very questionable.\u201d</p> <p>Vogel, and others, are right: there is little correlation objectively between British success at the Olympics and their recent performances in cycling world championships. But that, British Cycling bosses have countered, is exactly the point. Why waste your time peaking for a world championship, which no one outside your sport really cares about and which, crucially, has no impact on the funding the team receives? Far better to save your pennies and spend them when they really matter.</p> <p>This approach, which is either cutthroat or very canny, has trickled down from cycling and rowing to swimming and gymnastics \u2013 and even trampolining and diving, where the country has pretty well zero pedigree. Team GB certainly did not invent extreme specialisation. South Korea was perhaps the pioneer of the approach, concentrating since the 1980s on more obscure sports, such as archery, shooting and, in the Winter Olympics, speed skating, to bolster its medal count.</p> <p>But Britain has taken the tactic to another level. From 1996, when prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/shortcuts/2016/aug/17/how-john-major-became-an-unlikely-olympic-hero\" title=\"\">John Major decided that our Olympic performances were becoming embarrassing</a>, funding for elite sport has increased from \u00a35m to the \u00a3350m that has been invested in Olympic and Paralympic sport over the current four-year cycle.</p> <p>The approach really is ruthless: we are never going to beat the US at basketball, so what is the point in investing in that sport? Medal success in track and field athletics will always be the hardest to achieve, which is why rowing and cycling receive more funding, despite having fewer active participants.</p> <p>So is this money \u2013 which comes from the National Lottery and the exchequer at a ratio of 3:1 \u2013 well-spent? Participation in sport, according to Sport England, is declining overall despite Team GB\u2019s unprecedented achievements at the Olympics. There are real concerns about grassroots facilities, as many local authorities are forced to make cuts of around 20%.</p> <p>All of which means that British success these past weeks is probably most accurately seen as a fleeting and certainly expensive morale boost.</p> <p>Leave.EU, the Brexit campaign group backed by businessman Arron Banks, claimed last week that the medal haul was proof that the country will thrive outside the European Union. \u201cWe may be small,\u201d the slogan read, \u201cbut we truly are Great Britain!\u201d</p> <p>Such piggybacking feels a little desperate, though, and only really serves to remind us that soon Santa will take his bag of medals away for another four years and this blissful holiday from reality will be over.</p>",

After a combination of ropey shot selection and dire running got them in a tangle at 15 for three, Ben Duckett, in cahoots with his skipper Alex Wakely, dug them out of a deep hole with a brilliant stand of 123. After a flurry of late wickets, the bowlers - helped by some brilliantly catching - did magnificently to defend 161. <br></p> <p>Duckett, though, swiped and swatted his way to a class of his own. Many of his boundaries - some fortuitous, some just from brazen skill - came through fine leg, with an assortment of paddles and ramps, while he also cover drove and switch hit with disdain as he skipped his way to 84 off 47. He was particularly brutal on Samit Patel, who was thumped for 33 off 14 balls, but eventually Duckett was bowled try to sweep Jake Ball. Wackily nudged and nurdled his way to the final over, as wickets fell around him. <br></p> <p>When defending a low total, a wicket in each of the first three overs help; Michael Lumb miscued to third man, Alex Hales was bowled through the gate and Dan Christian was cramped on the pull, and Northants were flying. Riki Wessels and Samit started a rebuild, before Andre Russell briefly went nuts, maiming three magnificent sixes to cow.<br></p> <p>One swipe too many, though, saw Russell caught by a running, diving Rob Keogh on the midwicket fence, and Notts required a miracle from their lower order, especially when Samit drilled the ball straight back to Steven Crook. Chris Read briefly gave Notts hope, but picked out long-on and that, as they say, was that. <br></p> <p>This was Northants\u2019 first ever win over Notts in 2010, and their third final in four years.

  "<p>What should have been spring semester abroad spent sipping calimocho with sorority sisters on Barcelona\u2019s crowded beaches spiraled quickly into a protracted drama between two Penn State roommates that will play out in federal court. </p> <p>Molly Brownstein has accused her roommate and sorority sister, Rachel Lader, of being a \u201cmonster\u201d and an \u201cexpert bully with a PhD in intimidation\u201d. Lader, in reply, described Brownstein as messy, inconsiderate and reclusive by choice. </p> <p>Brownstein alleged that Lader, during the months they roomed together in Barcelona, refused to text her back in a timely manner, played music too loudly, repeatedly switched off the electricity while she showered, and on one occasion dumped a strainer of cooked pasta on her bed. Lader denied the shower and pasta incidents, though she said that she placed a colander \u2013 without noodles \u2013 on her roommate\u2019s bed as a signal to Brownstein, who never cleaned her dishes.</p> <p>Their fractured sisterhood is at the heart of a lawsuit involving accusations of relentless bullying and quid pro quo dealings, with each roommate casting herself as the victim of the saga. </p> <p>Lader, an aspiring lawyer, filed a defamation and breach-of-contract lawsuit in a Philadelphia court alleging that Brownstein\u2019s parents, <a href=\"http://phillyadclub.com/penn-state-university-names-marc-brownstein-2009-alumni-fellow/\">prominent university donors</a> and active alumni, used their influence to push for an unfounded disciplinary proceeding against her. The lawsuit, which was <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160819_Roommate_drama_lands_Penn_State_sorority_sisters_in_federal_court.html\">first reported the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>, is against Lader\u2019s roommate, Molly Brownstein; her parents, Amy and Marc; and Penn State University. </p> <p>\u201cThis willingness of Penn State to acquiesce to the inappropriate and harmful demands of a large money donor shocks the conscience,\u201d Lader\u2019s lawyer, Maurice Mitts, wrote in court documents. \u201cSimilarly, the extent to which Marc A Brownstein is willing to pervert his power and influence as a large-money Penn State donor for the purpose of intentionally harming Rachel is equally disturbing.\u201d</p> <p>Brownstein\u2019s lawyer, Paul Rosen, downplayed the accusations. </p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make a federal case out of this \u2013 a dispute between two sorority sisters?\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160819_Roommate_drama_lands_Penn_State_sorority_sisters_in_federal_court.html\">told the Inquirer</a>. \u201cPenn State is under a microscope and it\u2019s been under a microscope since [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/bruce-castor-pennsylvania-bill-cosby-jerry-sandusky-cases\">the sex abuse scandal</a> involving Jerry] Sandusky. It would be insane for anyone with the transparency going on in that school to make such an accusation.\u201d</p> <p>Both parents say their daughters suffered emotional and psychological damage. Brownstein\u2019s mother said her daughter became depressed.</p> <p>In a memo in her own words, Brownstein wrote: \u201cRachel bullied me to the point where I had to leave in the middle of the night in an area where people get stabbed outside my building. Whenever I think about it, it brings me to a full-on terrible place and makes me completely depressed.\u201d</p> <p>Lader said the ensuing disciplinary process caused debilitating migraines and made it difficult for her to study for a law school admissions exam. The incoming senior spent five days in the hospital for colitis, which she said was the result of stress and anxiety caused by the Brownstein\u2019s coordinated attacks on her character. </p> <p>The trouble began when the students, members of Penn University\u2019s Alpha Sigma Alpha sorority \u2013 whose mission is to \u201cto strive to develop women of poise &amp; purpose; and assist members in fostering lifetime friendships\u201d \u2013 decided to share an apartment for a semester abroad in Spain.</p> <p>Brownstein\u2019s mother, Amy, also intervened in the lawsuit. In an eight-page memo, titled \u201cA mother\u2019s perspective\u201d, she wrote that Lader purposefully ignored her daughter, refused to text back in a timely manner, and on one occasion brought a man back to their hotel room in Prague, forcing Brownstein to stay with friends.</p> <p>\u201cIn the sorority, it is generally understood that you do not cross Rachel Lader \u2013 better to pretend to be her friend, than be her enemy,\u201d the college student\u2019s mother wrote. \u201cThe other girls were frankly scared of Rachel.\u201d </p> <p>Lader, in the lawsuit, points to this characterization of her as both untrue and defamatory.</p> <p>Lader said Brownstein willfully excluded herself. She said Brownstein overslept on their Copenhagen visit, so they went to explore without texting to avoid waking her up. And she said the man in Prague was a longtime friend who was locked out of his apartment and needed a place to crash. He slept on the couch.</p> <p>As tension bubbled, Brownstein\u2019s mother tried to help from across the Atlantic. In February, the students\u2019 mothers spoke by phone and agreed to meet for dinner to resolve the dispute. Lader\u2019s mom canceled the dinner.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lader owed Brownstein $240 for their stay in Prague. This put Brownstein\u2019s mother in a precarious position. \u201cI had to be nice to [Lader\u2019s] mother once again and text her to pay us,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI obviously couldn\u2019t say bad things about Rachel because I wanted the check.\u201d</p> <p>The university began investigating the case in March, while both students were still attending classes at the University of New Haven in Barcelona. Lader said the investigation wasn\u2019t handled properly and the evidence she provided was not weighed fairly against Brownstein\u2019s accusations, many of which she denied. </p> <p>In a report by the university, Brownstein told the investigator that Barcelona was \u201cbad and really just a blur\u201d. She was asked to provide specific details about what Lader said to her but said it was \u201cdifficult to recall\u201d. </p> <p>In the lawsuit, Lader claims that she agreed to accept academic probation as punishment in order to put the incident behind her \u2013 but only on the condition that the resolution was kept from the Brownsteins. Not long after the agreement was reached, the Brownsteins were informed of the outcome, which Lader argues was a breach of contract.</p> <p>The women have both signed a lease to live together during the coming school year. In an email exchange included in the lawsuit, a friend of the Lader family asked the Brownsteins to confirm their daughter would not be moving into the apartment. Marc Brownstein replied that it wasn\u2019t so. His daughter \u201cdid not make the decision to not take the apartment\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>At this stage, it is fairly obvious what happens next. Claudio Bravo is on his way from Barcelona. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/19/pep-guardiola-will-allow-joe-hart-to-leave-manchester-city\" title=\"\">Joe Hart </a>has played his last game in Manchester City\u2019s colours and the speed at which everything has happened, with hardly a backwards glance from Pep Guardiola, means we will presumably hear more in the coming days about how cold and hard\u2011faced this sport can be sometimes.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Hart that is just the nature of the business and, while it is easy to understand an element of the sympathy, perhaps it might be an idea for some of the more outraged to go back to Guardiola\u2019s time at Barcelona and consider the results of a coach who knows precisely what he wants and refuses to bend for anyone.</p> <p>Barcelona also had players who saw themselves as untouchable when Guardiola took control in 2008. One was a former Ballon d\u2019Or winner, revered for elevating the sport to such extraordinary heights even the Real Madrid fans clapped him off the pitch after one <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> at the Bernab\u00e9u. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/apr/26/europeanfootball.sport\" title=\"\">Ronaldinho</a>, according to Xavi, \u201cchanged our history\u201d. He was the \u201cface of the project\u201d, in the words of Ferran Soriano, the vice-president. \u201cRonaldinho has the dribbling skills of Rivelino, the vision of Gerson, the irreverence of Garrincha, the speed of Jairzinho, the technique of Zico and the creativity of Rom\u00e1rio,\u201d Tost\u00e3o, Brazil\u2019s 1970 World Cup striker, said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/19/pep-guardiola-will-allow-joe-hart-to-leave-manchester-city\">Pep Guardiola will allow Joe Hart to leave Manchester City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the same time, Ronaldinho\u2019s last few seasons at the Camp Nou could also be summed up by his puppet on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM53QyVhr9o\" title=\"\"><em>Las Noticias del Gui\u00f1ol</em></a>, Spain\u2019s equivalent of <em>Spitting Image</em>, having the catchphrase \u201c<em>Fiesta!</em>\u201d The discipline had gone and the culture of the dressing room had suffered as a consequence. Nobody, however, could have imagined what would happen next. Deco, with his ability to unpick opposition defences, certainly didn\u2019t. Samuel Eto\u2019o, another dominant dressing-room personality, didn\u2019t. \u201cThese three are not in my mind for the future,\u201d Guardiola said on his first day in charge. \u201cIn fact, we will be going onwards without them. It\u2019s time for a restart.\u201d</p> <p>As it turned out Eto\u2019o was unable to find a new club and the decision was reversed. Eto\u2019o returned to the team and finished the season as runner-up in the <em>pichichi</em>, the award for La Liga\u2019s leading scorer, as well as being a decisive player in the Champions League, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/27/manchester-united-barcelona-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">scoring the first goal in the final</a> against Manchester United. What he didn\u2019t realise was that it would be his last game. That summer, Guardiola turfed him out. \u201cI understand perfectly that people want to know why this is happening because he\u2019s a marvellous footballer,\u201d Barcelona\u2019s coach explained. \u201cOn and off the pitch, he\u2019s been fine all year, but it\u2019s a question of feeling.\u201d</p> <p>By all accounts the same applies to Hart. He, too, has become a question of feeling and if that feels unsatisfactory to his sympathisers then it is probably worth keeping in mind that Guardiola\u2019s instincts helped create the most devastating and beautifully assembled club side in history at Bar\u00e7a, accumulating 14 out of a possible 19 trophies in four years. What he is not trying to win is a popularity contest and maybe a few misconceptions about City\u2019s new manager have been shattered in the process. \u201cHe\u2019s not an angel,\u201d as Graham Hunter writes in <em>Bar\u00e7a, the Making of the Greatest Team in the World</em>. \u201cHe can be intense, quixotic and hard to please \u2013 <em>pesado</em> they say in&#xa0;Spain.\u201d</p> <p>The translation is \u201cheavy\u201d and Hart presumably knows the feeling given he has not encountered this kind of rejection since a little-known story about Roberto Mancini \u2013 in <em>pesado</em> terms, a rucksack filled with breeze&#xa0;blocks \u2013 taking umbrage about his goalkeeper criticising the team\u2019s performance after a defeat against Real Madrid and, in a fit of pique, demanding the club put the England international up for sale.</p> <p>Mancini was talked out of that one and a few weeks later Borussia Dortmund were the visitors to the Etihad Stadium, back in the days when the Champions League anthem seemed to have the same effect on some of City\u2019s players as the theme from <em>Jaws</em> might have on a nervous swimmer. City, my report stated the following morning, were \u201coutplayed for long periods\u201d and could conceivably have been on the wrong end of \u201ca hiding\u201d. Yet there were periods of the game when someone could have chucked a handful of rice at Hart\u2019s goal and he would have kept out every grain. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/03/manchester-city-borussia-dortmund-champions-league\" title=\"\">City somehow emerged with a 1-1 draw</a> and the current captain of Manchester United joined in with the eulogies. \u201cBest keeper in the world,\u201d Wayne Rooney wrote on Twitter.</p> <p>Not quite. Hart has had so many accident-prone spells it was not an absolute shock to see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/27/england-iceland-euro-2016-match-report\" title=\"\">errors that undermined England</a> in Euro 2016 and they felt particularly chastening given all his extraneous pre-match preening.</p> <p>Equally, there have been periods of brilliance, too, and it might need several sessions of hypnosis before this correspondent can be convinced his current replacement, Willy Caballero, is not a greater risk to City\u2019s team.</p> <p>Another memory comes from City\u2019s visit to Barcelona in March last year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/18/barcelona-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">a 1-0 defeat in the Champions League</a> when Hart prevented another rout, epitomised by a wonderful moment at the final whistle when Luis Su\u00e1rez made a beeline for the goalkeeper. Su\u00e1rez embraced his opponent, looked him in the eye and told him he had never seen a performance like it. It was sheer wonder on the striker\u2019s face.</p> <p>Guardiola was there that night \u2013 you might remember him rocking with laughter in the stands after Lionel Messi\u2019s nutmeg on James Milner \u2013 and the shame, perhaps, is that a man with his coaching reputation is not willing apparently to work with Hart on what he perceives as the goalkeeper\u2019s weaknesses. If he thinks Hart\u2019s distribution dramatically needs to improve, could that have not been fine-tuned on the practice ground? If Hart needs to stop going long with his kicks, release the ball more quickly and understand the importance of building from the back, are these not tweaks that would have been relatively straightforward to introduce?</p> <p>Or maybe, just like with Eto\u2019o, the manager is relying on his \u201cfeeling\u201d and, if so, let\u2019s not forget he hasn\u2019t done too badly so far trusting his instincts. Guardiola was 37 when he accepted the job at Barcelona, under the spotlight of the world\u2019s media, and promptly announced the end for Ronaldinho, Deco and Eto\u2019o. Like all great managers he can be hard, unflinching and, yes, a bit of a bastard at times. Don\u2019t think for one second he will be concerned that Hart has the respect of the dressing room. Don\u2019t imagine him being troubled by the risk involved, or the criticism it has attracted. Don\u2019t presume Guardiola goes home at night worrying that Joey Barton might want to lecture him on standards of professional etiquette.</p> <p>Something similar is happening at Manchester United bearing in mind Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/04/bayern-president-slams-bastian-schweinsteiger-snub-manchester-united\" title=\"\">cut Bastian Schweinsteiger free</a> and the froth of indignation it has caused in Germany. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and various others at Bayern Munich have taken turns to express their outrage \u2013 though not to the point, it seems, where they are willing to buy the player back \u2013 while some bright spark from Fifpro, the worldwide players\u2019 union, seems to be under the impression Schweinsteiger had been the victim of a serious crime rather than being removed from first-team activities. \u201cIt\u2019s clear bullying,\u201d Dejan Stefanovic, a Slovenian lawyer, said. \u201cIn Slovenia we would have indicted Mourinho and asked for the highest penalty \u2013 three years in prison.\u201d In which case just about every manager in the business might be banged up and Sir Alex Ferguson can expect the key to be thrown away.</p> <p>Alternatively, Mourinho has worked out that Schweinsteiger\u2019s legs can no longer keep up with his brain. The midfielder\u2019s performances symbolised last season\u2019s dreariness at Old Trafford and you might recall some killer detail after Louis van Gaal\u2019s sacking about how little time Schweinsteiger apparently spent in Manchester. Schweinsteiger was injured in January and had a tendency to return to Germany, flying in for United\u2019s matches then straight back out again. It went down badly in the dressing room, to say the least. \u201cTaking the piss,\u201d was one&#xa0;description.</p> <p>Hart is a far more established figure in his own dressing room but, in a strange way, that might work in Guardiola\u2019s favour in a profession where he always has to be seen very much as the boss. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Barton said. But it is nothing of the sort. Ruthless? Yes. Polarising? Undoubtedly. But there is nothing disgusting about wanting better for your team and if anyone in football is entitled to back their judgment it is a man with Guardiola\u2019s record of achievement.</p> <h2>Forestieri affair awkward for FA</h2> <p>Fernando Forestieri refused to board the bus for Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s game at Norwich City last weekend amid talk of a potential transfer and reports that his employers were threatening to make an official tapping-up complaint against an unnamed club.</p> <p>Forestieri, strongly linked with two other Championship clubs, also had to be persuaded to appear in the opening game against Aston Villa. His club have since made it clear they will not be backed into a corner and Forestieri, displaying more nerve than an infected tooth, has subsequently released a statement apologising for his behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cI can only repeat that never once did I even consider leaving Sheffield Wednesday, and I am sorry if anyone ever thought that was the case,\u201d he said. \u201cMy heart is with Sheffield Wednesday.\u201d</p> <p>It is good of him to clear that up and, naturally, who would ever doubt a word?<strong> </strong>It&#xa0;is a pity, though, that Wednesday have decided against making that complaint if they genuinely have evidence he has been offered alternative employment behind their backs. For starters, it would have been intriguing to see what the Football Association made of it after interviewing Steve Bruce for the England job without, according to Hull City, the governing body making an official<strong> </strong>approach.</p> <h2>Why Rooney jibe carries no weight </h2> <p>Paul Parker, once a defender of some distinction for Manchester United, appears to have signed himself over to the industry of football\u2019s rent-a-quotes with his allegations that Wayne Rooney is \u201cslow and overweight\u201d and in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team \u201cbecause of marketing\u201d.</p> <p>Yes, Rooney is not the player he once was. He has lost his burst of acceleration, rarely taking on opponents in the way that used to come naturally to him earlier in his career, and that won\u2019t change now he is approaching his 31st birthday.</p> <p>Yet it is a form of silliness that might embarrass even Tommy Docherty, the original United rent-a-quote, to claim that Mourinho is keeping a player in the team for commercial reasons.</p> <p>As for the allegation of excess baggage, it struck me from spending time with Rooney at Euro 2016 \u2013 not an exact science, admittedly \u2013 how slight he actually is, close up. Rooney is smaller than you might imagine and if he were overweight there would be no keeping it from United \u2013 or England, for that matter \u2013 bearing in mind the checks players undergo these days and the technology that monitors exactly how far they have run, at what speed, their body-fat percentages and much more.</p> <p>Football has certainly moved on a long way since a story Larry Lloyd told me recently about his own playing days, when Nottingham Forest won two European Cups despite their idea of sports science being no more refined than the first-team trainer, Jimmy Gordon, weighing each player on scales every Friday morning.</p> <p>If a player was a couple of pounds over, Lloyd explained, Gordon would threaten to tell Brian Clough. If it was only one pound, the player involved might be able to talk his way out of it. \u201cThat\u2019s just a good shit,\u201d was Lloyd\u2019s favourite get-out clause.</p>",
  "<p>Death, taxes, the United States women\u2019s basketball team.</p> <p>The surest bet at these Olympics retained a gold medal that\u2019s become an American birthright with an overwhelming 101-72 win over Spain on Saturday afternoon. It marked the team\u2019s sixth consecutive gold in women\u2019s basketball \u2013 and the fourth straight for elder stateswomen Diana Taurasi, Sue Bird and Tamika Catchings.</p> <p>Where to begin in a recount of Team USA\u2019s supremacy in Rio, a dominance that\u2019s been demonstrated to an almost numbing effect under iconic University of Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma? They won their eight games by an average margin of 37.3 points. They became the first team to surpass 100 points in four straight games. They extended their winning streak in Olympic play to 49 games, with only one in that span decided by less than 10 points. They hung 121 on Senegal and won by 65, while their biggest scare was a stress-free 19-point win over France in the semis.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we demonstrated that we\u2019re one of the best teams ever,\u201d said Bird, the team captain who missed the semi-final while recovering from a sprained right knee capsule but returned for the gold medal game.</p> <p>Taurasi, widely regarded as one of the best players ever, matched a five-time WNBA all-star Lindsay Whalen with a team-high 17 points on Saturday. Maya Moore added 14 more to go with five rebounds and six assists. Now the talent-stacked Americans are champions once again.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty incredible,\u201d said Taurasi, the 34-year-old guard led the team in scoring with 15.6 points per game over eight contests. \u201cWe had a goal to win the gold medal but there\u2019s something more to it than that. It\u2019s not about one person, one coach, it\u2019s about, \u2018how can we make this the best basketball team ever?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Team USA took Spain\u2019s best punches early behind a flurry from Alba Torrens, who scored or assisted on all but four of her team\u2019s first-quarter points while the Americans made up for off-target shooting with a heavy advantage on the boards. When the 26-year-old shooting guard from Binissalem canned a three-pointer with 2:04 remaining in the opener, Spain led 17-14. It wouldn\u2019t last for long.</p> <p>By the second quarter the Americans were wearing the Spanish down with breakneck pace and a roster of talent so deep that reigning WNBA Most Valuable Player holder Elena Della Donne (10 points on Saturday) came off the bench and two-time winner Candace Parker didn\u2019t even make the team. After a period that saw the US team stretch the lead to 49-32 entering half-time, all but one of the US team\u2019s players were on the scoresheet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/20/womens-olympic-basketball-final-usa-v-spain-live\">Women's Olympic basketball final: USA beat Spain to win gold medal \u2013 as it happened!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Taurasi knocked down her third three-pointer off a Whalen assist with 7:59 remaining in the third the lead stretched to 56-34, and Spain coach Lucas Mondelo immediately called timeout \u2013 though you could scarcely imagine what counsel he had to offer.</p> <p>By the third quarter Spain\u2019s frontcourt \u2013 already undermanned after Sancho Lyttle\u2019s broken foot last round \u2013 was in foul trouble and the ship was fast taking on water. As the buzzer sounded for the end of the period, a last-gasp heave by Spain\u2019s Silvia Dominguez from a few steps inside half-court found the bottom of the net. That cut the lead to a mere 81-49.</p> <p>When the final buzzer sounded the team moved into a cluster of embraces over the court, overjoyed but unsurprised. Whether Taurasi\u2019s goal of all-time supremacy was met is an unanswerable question, but for a fortnight at Carioca Arena 1 the US women sure looked the part.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just special,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do something unexpected, but it\u2019s another thing to do something you\u2019re supposed to do, year after year, game after game, quarter after quarter, and this team didn\u2019t get complacent. I think that\u2019s the sign of a true champion, someone who loves the game and plays for the right reasons. Every quarter that we stepped on the court, we respected the game, we respected each other, and did everything we needed to do to deserve this gold.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Shakur Stevenson\u2019s dreams of winning an Olympic gold medal and ending the United States\u2019 historic drought in men\u2019s boxing ended in tears after he settled for silver with a split-decision loss to Cuba\u2019s Robeisy Ramirez in the bantamweight final at Riocentro.</p> <p>The highly entertaining clash of southpaws could have gone either way: official judges Trong Nghia Vuong of Vietnam and Fathi Madfoua of France scored it 29-28 for Ramirez, while Greece\u2019s Evangelos Bougioukas had it 29-28 for the teenager from Newark, New Jersey.</p> <p>The result gave Ramirez a second gold after winning the flyweight division four years ago in London, making him only the sixth man to win Olympic titles in two different divisions after Vasyl Lomachenko of Ukraine, Russia\u2019s Aleksei Tishchenko, Cuba\u2019s \u00c1ngel Herrera Vera, Hungary\u2019s L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Papp and Oliver Kirk of the United States.</p> <p>For Stevenson, who is named for the rapper who died nine months before he was born, it marked his first ever loss in international competition.

  "<p>Ten days ago my phone pinged. It was my plastic surgeon colleague from M1 Hospital in Aleppo asking my advice about a patient with a deep defect in his pelvis. He told me that around 20 patients were being admitted following a suspected chemical weapon attack with chlorine. His emergency department was full. He had not enough masks or oxygen cylinders available to treat the majority. He was not able to ventilate any of the seriously ill patients because of lack of equipment. Two patients subsequently died from the chlorine, which turned into hydrochloric acid and dissolved their lungs. He was devastated.</p> <p>We continued the dialogue the following day when he told me that, from 8 o\u2019clock in the morning until midnight, there was a constant barrage of bombs dropped by the Russian and Syrian air forces and there was a constant flood of dead and dying patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f035d5c2976ce37bf41f89caeeb45a567bdf7c86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f035d5c2976ce37bf41f89caeeb45a567bdf7c86/1223_181_611_764/400.jpg\" alt=\"British surgeon David Nott, who has worked in Aleppo since 2013.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cEach day would be a mass casualty event,\u201d says British surgeon David Nott, who has worked in Aleppo since 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MSF/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A week later another colleague from M10 hospital rang me and told me he had treated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/shocked-by-the-image-of-the-syrian-boy-in-the-rubble-heres-how-to-help\">Omran, the young boy whose picture had gone viral</a> on social media. To be honest, I had not seen the picture. He simply wanted to tell me that the boy had survived and he had treated his deep scalp wound and he was going to be discharged home.</p> <p>I asked him whether he wanted to go on television and contacted the BBC and Channel 4. He was willing to do this but not to show his face, as he would surely have been targeted by the regime. To see him talking on my television brought a lump to my throat. He is the kindest and nicest human being I\u2019ve ever worked with. He has been there from the start of the war and his only words on the television were: \u201cPlease help us.\u201d</p> <p>I know exactly where he was and really wished I could be there with him. He has not done anything wrong: he is only there to help people, as are all my other colleagues and friends who are working round the clock. They are all exhausted and stressed. They will not leave because they have so much work to do.</p> <p>The picture of this little boy must be a turning point in this war. It must not be looked at and forgotten within 24 hours. I have pictures on my phone and in my computer of all the cases that I dealt with when I was in Aleppo. These images are far worse than the image of Omran. They are of dead and dying children. I have given lectures showing these pictures and have had people in the audience crying. Why has the world become heartless?</p> <p>When President Obama talked about crossing the red line after 400 children were killed by chemical weapons outside Damascus in 2013, he was awaiting the outcome of a vote on action in the British parliament. In the end it was close, with 285-272 voting against military action against the Syrian regime. If the west had shown strong leadership, I have no doubt that the Syrian military hierarchy would have collapsed. George Osborne said prophetically: \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t become a moment when we turn our back on all the world\u2019s problems.\u201d It\u2019s not often that a politician gets it right, but he did then.</p> <p>I packed my gas mask and spent six weeks in Aleppo just after that statement in 2013. Aleppo was a very moderate city. The rebel side was controlled by the Free Syrian Army. It was promised help by the west and was expecting humanitarian aid and equipment to overthrow the Assad regime. Most of my time was spent teaching the surgeons how to perform very difficult trauma surgery following gunshot wounds and fragmentation wounds from Syrian jet airstrikes. On average we would treat about 12 to 14 gunshot wounds a day, and we had excellent backup support on the intensive care unit from intensive physicians in Washington manning the ventilators by Skype.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/refugees-greek-camps-targeted-mafia-gangs\">Refugees in Greek camps targeted by mafia gangs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was protected by the Aleppo city medical council, who looked after me like a parent looks after a child. I was the only westerner in Aleppo then, as Isis had control of the north and made it very difficult to cross checkpoints. There were no reporters in Aleppo, so I came home and talked of the horrors I had seen as snipers from the Syrian regime played games with women and children\u2019s lives.</p> <p>When I returned to Aleppo in September 2014, Syrian jets were still flying low level around the city shooting at anybody using rockets, but worse were the Syrian helicopters dropping barrel bombs containing around 500kg of TNT indiscriminately on densely populated areas. Ambulances would bring in hordes of patients and each day would be a mass casualty event.</p> <p>All people living in non-regime areas were classified as terrorists. I, as a humanitarian just going to operate and save lives, would have also been looked on as a terrorist and would have been jailed and tortured and most likely killed \u2013 as was Abbas Khan, my British orthopaedic colleague who volunteered in the same hospital as I did. October 2014 was a particularly awful period, not just for the residents of Aleppo but also for the western hostages, including journalists and humanitarians, who were facing being beheaded by Isis.</p> <p>At the time I was probably about 30 miles away from where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Henning\">Alan Henning</a>, who was delivering an ambulance to Aleppo, had the most terrible fate inflicted on him. It was just too dangerous for journalists to go in, and thus the horror was kept off the world\u2019s radar. This allowed the Syrian regime to perpetuate the worst atrocities unhindered.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/30/russia-launches-first-airstrikes-against-targets-in-syria-says-us\">The intervention by Russia in September 2015</a> was made at the request of a beleaguered Assad regime. Assad\u2019s forces have been falling apart ever since the conflict began and havehad to be propped up by militias from Iran and Hezbollah. It suited Russia to be involved. By standing up to the west he has become a global player and is challenging the monopoly of the influence in the Middle East which had been held by the US for decades.</p> <p>The Syrian and Russian regimes did not appreciate the effect it would have on galvanising the opposition fighters. This has led to a significant increase in heavy Russian and Syrian airstrikes. This is always cyclical; the more the opposition gains, the heavier the response, and this is what we are seeing now. The picture of Omran epitomises the horror that can be broadcast on our television screens. It is significantly better than many of the pictures of children coming out from Aleppo but should still shame world leaders. Hopefully this will galvanise the west to finally stop sitting back and being passive observers. This war is different because it is our war. The refugees that have poured into Europe are there because we have not done anything to stop the suffering. If we wait for another five years, there will be one million people killed and 20 million refugees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/turkey-announces-more-active-role-in-syria-conflict\">Turkey announces more active role in Syria conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sticking point is whether Assad stays or goes.

In the month since the camp opened its doors, it has won plaudits for being the most humane refugee centre in Greece.</p> <p>\u201cNobody is using money here efficiently or effectively,\u201d lamented Khan. \u201cThe humanitarian system is the same one that has been in place since the second world war, it lacks intellectual flexibility and is totally broken. The real question to be asked is, has the aid that has been given been appropriately utilised?\u201d</p>",

Mark Clattenburg disagreed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"547ad360bd39439d577f2a6a13bcf0b11b48facf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/547ad360bd39439d577f2a6a13bcf0b11b48facf/0_116_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal\u2019s Czech goalkeeper Petr Cech comes out to take the ball off Leicester City\u2019s Jamie Vardy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal\u2019s Czech goalkeeper Petr Cech comes out to take the ball off Leicester City\u2019s Jamie Vardy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T18:18:17.839Z\">at 7.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b88f04e4b047b85f60203a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T17:10:37.566Z\">6.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>40 min</strong> A couple of important defensive headers from Koscielny, who has been excellent thus far.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b88e62e4b047b85f602034\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T17:08:29.734Z\">6.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>38 min </strong>Oxlade-Chamberlain combines well with Alexis and roars past Simpson on the halfway line.

  "<p>A federal judge has ordered Hillary Clinton to answer written questions about her use of a private email server while at the state department in response to a lawsuit by a conservative watchdog group, though he declined to make her submit to a sworn deposition.</p> <p>District court judge Emmet Sullivan said Clinton must reply in writing to questions posed by the group, Judicial Watch, about why she set up a system to conduct state department business, a decision that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">led to an FBI investigation</a> and has haunted the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign for over a year.</p> <p>The judge said the group failed to demonstrate that an hours-long deposition was necessary to clarify why Clinton set up the private server, as opposed to seeking the information \u201cthrough other, less burdensome or intrusive means such as interrogatories\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cJudicial Watch\u2019s argument that a deposition is preferable in this case because of the ability to ask follow-up questions is not persuasive,\u201d Sullivan wrote. \u201cGiven the extensive public record related to the clintonemail.com system, a record which Judicial Watch has acknowledged, Judicial Watch will be able to anticipate many follow-up questions.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton-email-investigation-fact-check\">'What I did was allowed': fact-checking Clinton's statements on email inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Judicial Watch made a name for itself by dogging former president Bill Clinton, and has now filed a number of lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act (Foia) seeking records from the state department about Hillary Clinton\u2019s time spent as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. </p> <p>Judicial Watch\u2019s president, Tom Fitton, praised the judge\u2019s decision in a statement. \u201cWe are pleased that this federal court ordered Hillary Clinton to provide written answers under oath to some key questions about her email scandal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will move quickly to get these answers. The decision is a reminder that Hillary Clinton is not above the law.\u201d</p> <p>The decision means Clinton will probably not have to step away from the campaign trail to sit for an interview with some of her fiercest critics, but ensures that the controversy will continue to follower her throughout the final weeks of the presidential campaign. </p> <p>Judicial Watch has until 14 October to submit questions to Clinton, who must respond within 30 days, according to the decision. </p> <p>Separately, Sullivan approved Judicial Watch\u2019s request to depose John Bentel, a senior state department aide who has since retired, due to \u201ccontradictory evidence\u201d about the extent of his knowledge of Clinton\u2019s server and email practices. However, he declined the group\u2019s request to depose Clarence Finney, a state department official handling Foia requests. </p> <p>In July, the FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">closed its investigation into Clinton\u2019s email server</a> after she sat for a three-hour interview. Director James Comey said that while she and her staff had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of emails, a handful of which contained classified information at the time, the FBI would not recommend prosecutors seek charges in the case.</p> <p>The judge also ordered the federal government to begin releasing the \u201cthousands of work-related emails\u201d that the FBI said it had recovered in its investigation.</p> <p>Clinton has apologized for setting up the server, maintaining that the decision was a \u201cmistake\u201d and not an attempt to obfuscate her actions or skirt reporting laws. She also noted that this was the practice of her predecessors, though the law was tightened by the Obama administration.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/us/politics/hillary-clinton-told-fbi-colin-powell-advised-her-to-use-private-email.html?ref=politics\">reported</a> that former secretary of state Colin Powell was said to have advised Clinton to use a personal email account. The report was based on notes from the FBI handed over to Congress. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-clinton-fbi-idUKKCN10U0FO\">statement</a>, Powell\u2019s office said he wrote Clinton an \u201cemail memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department\u201d while also noting that \u201cat the time there was no equivalent system with the department\u201d. </p>",
  "<p>Ronald Koeman was wearing a broad smile and with good reason. Not only had he claimed his first win as the Everton manager but, perhaps more significantly, he was able to confirm his leading striker Romelu Lukaku has decided to stay at Goodison Park.</p> <p>It was a decisive intervention from Koeman that turned the course of this typically fiercely contested match with Tony Pulis\u2019s West Brom. Having gone behind to an early Gareth McAuley goal, he brought Lukaku into the game 10 minutes before half-time. Everton were level before the break and rampant in a second half that was decided by Gareth Barry\u2019s header and also featured a sparkling cameo from the debutant Yannick Bolasie.</p> <p>\u201cI can confirm Romelu is staying with the club,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cHe spoke to me yesterday morning and told me he had made the decision by himself to stay at least one more season at Everton. It\u2019s great news for everyone and it\u2019s possible he may sign a new contract.\u201d</p> <p>Pulis remained on his feet for the entirety of his post-match press conference and kept repeating the phrase \u201c10 days\u201d, the amount of time left in this transfer window for West Brom and their new Chinese owners to strengthen the squad.</p> <p>Everton started the game as they did against Spurs in a new 3-4-3 formation. The home side were quick to exploit any unfamiliarity. In the eighth minute Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n forced Ramiro Funes Mori into a nervous backpass that went straight to the Venezuelan. Maarten Stekelenburg rushed out to smother the shot but at the expense of a corner. Craig Gardner swung the ball in, Saido Berahino blocked off the Dutch goalkeeper and the 36-year-old McAuley was at the back post to continue his Indian summer and power a header into the net.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"186384ac3b8d0262b63bb7297a612c08655ea6f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/186384ac3b8d0262b63bb7297a612c08655ea6f8/0_0_4152_2491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth McAuley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth McAuley climbs above several Everton defenders to open the scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everton responded by gaining control of possession, but failed to pose any attacking threat. Their biggest problem was making effective use of nominal No9, Gerard Deulofeu. The Spaniard had the speed to trouble McAuley and co but West Brom were sitting too deep for it to make a difference. And when tasked with finding a short through ball instead, Ross Barkley and Kevin Mirallas struggled.</p> <p>With 10 minutes still to go to half-time, Koeman turned to Lukaku. The Belgian, subject of much summer transfer speculation, had yet to play in the Premier League this season. He came on here, replacing the wing-back James McCarthy, and immediately made an impact. Not only did he provide McAuley and Jonas Olsson with a worthy physical opponent, he allowed Everton to settle into a more comfortable 4-2-3-1 formation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/watford-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea\u2019s Diego Costa pounces late to sink battling Watford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was a tactical change\u201a\u201d Koeman confirmed. \u201cWe started with three at the back and if you go one nil down and they drop back even further, you really need a target man, you need to make the pitch wider. From that moment on we were the dominant team.\u201d</p> <p>Everton were level by half-time through Mirallas. Picking up the ball in the inside-left channel, the Belgian drifted inside as if to shoot but instead passed to Barry. Barry\u2019s first-time pass was matched by Barkley who found Mirallas again and his far-post shot was too powerful for Ben Foster to keep out. It was a cracking goal.</p> <p>Everton came out of the blocks in the second half, with Mirallas and the teenage full-back Mason Holgate causing havoc. Having robbed Olsson in possession and drawn a foul, Mirallas took a free-kick that was nearly converted by Funes Mori. Foster pushed the ball wide, but the corner that followed found Holgate unmarked at the back post. The teenager drilled his shot into the turf but the ball looped over the West Brom defenders and into the path of the onrushing Barry, who gobbled up the header at the near post.</p> <p>Pulis attempted to get back into the game by replacing his wing men and adding Rickie Lambert up front. Lambert might have scored with his first touch but could not quite reach James McClean\u2019s cross. Koeman meanwhile was able to grant Bolasie an Everton debut and the DR Congo international gave a sparkling sideshow, teeing up Lukaku for a one-on-one he should have buried to give the match a more reflective scoreline.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/tottenham-hotspur-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Victor Wanyama strikes late for Tottenham to see off Crystal Palace</a> </p> </aside>",

  "<p>Fans of the great British boozer should be raising a glass to Wandsworth council. The local authority stepped in last week to throw a protective arm around the borough\u2019s licensed premises, a move real-ale lobby group Camra has urged other councils to follow in order to slow the closure of pubs for redevelopment.</p> <p>The number of pubs across the UK has been in decline for years, and while the pace of their disappearance has slowed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/10/pricey-pints-blamed-as-21-british-pubs-a-week-call-time-at-the-bar\">from 27 a week earlier this year to 21</a>, according to Camra \u2013 the direction of travel has not changed.</p> <p>The trend has been attributed to factors including pub prices comparing unfavourably with the cost of alcohol in supermarkets and changing cultural habits, with more people entertaining and sharing a tipple at home.</p> <p>Another increasingly common denominator in pub closures has been large chains finding it more lucrative to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/23/pubs-last-orders-developers\">sell or redevelop premises for other purposes</a>, such as housing or supermarkets, than to continue running them as pubs. <a href=\"http://www.fleurets.com/market-intelligence/media/survey_of_pub_prices_dec_15.pdf\">A report by London property agency Fleurets</a> found that half of the pubs sold in 2015 were converted for other use.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve sold more pubs for multimillion sums this year than I ever have,\u201d says James Davies, head of pubs at Fleurets. \u201cThe demand for property in London is exceptionally strong. The market will pay more than perhaps it\u2019s worth because they want the asset so much.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with this trend, Wandsworth council in south London took the unprecedented step of using a special piece of planning law \u2013 an \u201carticle 4 direction\u201d \u2013 to protect its pubs. The provision, usually employed in regard to individual developments, means that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/17/london-council-protects-historic-pubs-conversion-wandsworth\">owners of 120 bars and pubs in the borough will have to seek council permission</a> before changing the building\u2019s use or knocking it down. Wandsworth said the sites had been chosen for their \u201chistoric or architectural value or because they make a positive contribution to their community\u201d.</p> <p>Councils across the UK, some of which have already used article 4 in individual cases, are understood to be keeping an eye on what happens in Wandsworth. The move was inspired partly by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/jul/17/how-to-save-pub-risk-closure\">high-profile campaign to save The Wheatsheaf</a>, a redbrick Victorian watering hole in Tooting Bec that was due to be sold to Tesco.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62d9593b49b1c42b149c6b9da1dc90aaf9f1000d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62d9593b49b1c42b149c6b9da1dc90aaf9f1000d/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wheatsheaf pub in Tooting Bec.

They were left with no illusions that this is what people wanted. No politician in their right mind was going to let it close.\u201d</p> <p>Methods used elsewhere to protect pubs have had mixed results. Many communities sought to have their local declared an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6069/1987150.pdf\">asset of community value</a> (ACV), which triggers a six-month moratorium on the building being sold, giving residents a chance to raise enough cash to table their own bid for it.</p> <p>Some 1,200 pubs around the UK now have ACV status, and some government cash, albeit a modest \u00a31.5m in total, is available to communities in the form of a pub loan fund administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p> <p>But ACV status doesn\u2019t help much when communities can\u2019t raise enough money to put in a competitive offer. And a cash shortfall among community bidders is much more likely in areas with high property prices, where redevelopments are consequently more likely.</p> <p>\u201cIt has become evident that ACV listings are not enough to give pubs the protection they deserve from closure, or acquisition and demolition, or redevelopment by investors,\u201d said Colin Valentine, chairman of Camra. \u201cCommunities are not getting enough of a say in the process when the pubs they treasure are threatened by closure or change of use.\u201d</p> <p>John Harrison, who lives in the south Cambridgeshire village of Guilden Morden, is among the leaders of an <a href=\"http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/councillors-set-approve-guilden-morden-pub/story-28838203-detail/story.html\">ongoing campaign to save the village\u2019s Three Tuns pub</a> and agrees that ACV status has yielded mixed results.</p> <p>\u201cThe concern I have is not the legislative framework but the inconsistency of application by officers at local level,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIn our case, the officers ignored the pub\u2019s ACV status and its heritage as a listed building in a conservation area.</p> <p>\u201cThe main reason so many are closing is that the value of the building and the land for housing is much more than its value as a pub, especially in the south-east. But if we allow pubs to be lost unnecessarily, we undermine our local communities.\u201d</p> <p>Harrison believes article 4 powers, or even compulsory purchase orders allowing councils to buy property deemed of value to the area, might be needed to expand campaigners\u2019 toolkit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e14c262a0445f63ef2900a13b64985b0f6baf00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e14c262a0445f63ef2900a13b64985b0f6baf00/0_780_4565_2739/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wheatsheaf pub, which was due to redeveloped into a Tesco food store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wheatsheaf pub, which was due to redeveloped into a Tesco food store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFrom the conversations we have had with other community groups trying to save their pubs this [problem with ACVs] is not unique. We have had to fight a lot harder than we should have done to avoid losing an important local asset. I think it [use of article 4] may have been helpful to us, because anything that makes it harder to turn pubs into houses is good.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the British Beer and Pubs Association, which represents the very pub companies which are often behind the sale and closure of premises for redevelopment, doesn\u2019t think councils should copy Wandsworth\u2019s blanket approach.</p> <p>\u201cIt is right that there are laws to protect pubs that are of real value, to local people and local communities,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cThis can be done by using the laws that make a pub an asset of community value.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, as each pub\u2019s situation is different, this should be looked at on a case-by-case basis. We are against blanket measures, as every case should be judged on its own merits. In some cases a pub might not be viable. A measure like this then makes it very difficult to sell, and restricts investment, which has a huge financial impact.\u201d</p> <p>Some councils, keen not to obstruct much-needed developments for the sake of pubs that can\u2019t be saved, have opted to apply bespoke measures rather than powers such as article 4.</p> <p>In 2012, Cambridge city council issued a set of guidelines aimed at stemming a wave of pub closures as property owners cashed in on the city\u2019s high property prices.</p> <p>Rather than seeking a blanket measure requiring planning approval, the council <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/sites/default/files/docs/protection-of-public-houses-ippg.pdf\">drew up its own policies</a>, aimed at ensuring that developments could go ahead only once it had become clear that a pub was not viable. This includes a requirement that the property be on the market for at least 12 months as a public house, and that it has not otherwise been shown to be of particular value to the community.</p> <p>While Cambridge council can still wheel out the big guns of article 4 in special cases, coming up with its own approach allows it to tailor policy to the local situation.</p> <p>Whatever the measures at the disposal of councils, the key component is still concerted and passionate local campaigns led by committed people. After the success of the campaign to save The Wheatsheaf, Irwin wants groups who fear the loss of a much-loved tavern to follow suit, whether through ACVs, article 4 or other means.</p> <p>\u201cWe let developers do what they want at our peril. The door is ajar, the example is there. Why not copy it?\u201d</p>",

At the time the condition was still referred to as mongolism and there was little support on offer. Rix became involved with Mencap (then the National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults) to try to change this. </p> <p>The actor, who was born in east Yorkshire, first found acting work at the age of 18 with Donald Wolfit\u2019s Royal Shakespeare Company while on deferred service from the Royal Air Force. Only a few months later, he played Sebastian in <em>Twelfth Night</em> in the West End. When his military deferment was extended, he gained more regular stage experience with the White Rose Players in Harrogate. After serving in the RAF, he ended up as a volunteer Bevin Boy, working in Doncaster\u2019s coal mines.</p> <p>Rix made his name as an actor-manager after appearing on tour with Gray in the farce <em>Reluctant Heroes</em> by Colin Morris.

Key farces included <em>Dry Rot</em> by John Chapman and <em>Chase Me, Comrade</em> by Ray Cooney, and although this brand of comedy drew big audiences and enjoyed record-breaking runs Rix said he was resigned to not winning much recognition from the serious sector of the profession.</p> <p>In 1980 theatre critic Michael Coveney expressed regret about critics\u2019 attitude to Whitehall farces. \u201cA tradition of critical snobbery has grown up around these plays,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpartly because they were so blatantly popular, but chiefly because of our conviction that farce, unless written by a Frenchman, is an inferior theatrical species.

But for Alden it is more about the alternative challenge posed by China, which is <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-ceo-trade-idUSKCN10Q1NS\">seeking its own deal</a> with the TPP participants if the US cannot fulfill its promise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/30/donald-trump-free-trade-foreign-policy-china-republicans\">How Donald Trump upended Republican orthodoxy on free trade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the architecture going forward,\u201d says Alden. \u201cChina would like to see a very different set of trade rules. If TPP fails, the rest of the countries in Asia will have no choice but to go in the direction that China wants to move. The irony of it all is that opposing TPP will probably help China most.\u201d</p> <p>For the White House, this is the biggest reason to keep battling for TPP. If China seizes control of the Asian trade agenda, then it could quickly assert political and security dominance over the region and leave Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d toward the region in tatters.</p> <p>But few insiders think Clinton or congressional Republicans, much less Trump, will drop their opposition. \u201cThe idea that we are going to sacrifice manufacturing jobs to suit some esoteric foreign policy goal is just really not going to fly,\u201d one senior DC lobbyist said.</p> <p>Even the fabled influence of corporate America may not be enough to swing the argument, as illustrated by the scene of Clinton\u2019s speech, Detroit.</p> <p>\u201cWe export $140bn of finished vehicles and parts. We have supported every trade agreement in history, but we remain sceptical of this one,\u201d said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council and a former governor of Missouri.</p> <p>Among the three big members, Ford openly opposes TPP because it fears the deal does nothing to stop Japan manipulating its currency at the expense of US rivals. But even General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have refused to come out swinging for a deal that would, in theory, open up important new markets in Vietnam and Malaysia.</p> <p>For many US businessmen, the lack of political support for trade is perplexing, even in rust belt states where the most is at stake.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Given that the economy is kind of coming back right now, I just didn\u2019t understand why trade was so prominent this race</p> <footer> <cite>David Lawrence, vice-president, AlphaUSA</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cGiven that the economy is kind of coming back right now, something that is so key to the economy [as trade], I just didn\u2019t understand why it was so prominent this race, and not some other issue,\u201d said David Lawrence, vice-president of AlphaUSA, a fastener manufacturer based in suburban Detroit.</p> <p>Alpha opened in Detroit nearly six decades ago, later moving to the suburbs.

There\u2019s no margins for anything, it\u2019s like \u2013 basically you\u2019re lucky to make 10% on stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The competitive nature of business under free trade still rattles his father and grandfather, who launched the company over five decades ago. \u201cThey still don\u2019t understand,\u201d Semple said. \u201cHow could they do this or this? We used to write on a bar napkin the price, and whoever the highest was, we\u2019d submit it and get the work.\u201d</p> <p>The trade debate has particularly resonated in Michigan\u2019s Macomb County, which produced the band of \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d who helped propel the former Republican president to victory, and whom Trump has promised to reinvigorate. </p> <p>Kurt Larson, 66, a retired auto worker who lives in Macomb County\u2019s seat, Mount Clemens, recalled living in Arizona and how his father used to work for Motorola and witnessed first-hand the effect of jobs moving out of the US. \u201cHe would go to other countries,\u201d Larson said, \u201cthey would build factories and get people to assemble semiconductors for 30 cents an hour.\u201d And as trade deals came into place, the trend continued. </p> <p>\u201cI never want to see jobs that Americans do go overseas or abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s counterproductive to our country.\u201d</p> <p>Walking along the quiet streets of downtown Mount Clemens, Dwayne Johnson, a construction worker who lives in the city of Dearborn, said he believes re-negotiating new trade deals is a \u201cgreat idea\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt depends on whether we\u2019re making money or how good the trade [agreement] is for the United States,\u201d said the 57-year-old. \u201cWhat I mean by that is, they\u2019re taking all the jobs from over here and they\u2019re putting them in other countries,\u201d he added. \u201cIt don\u2019t seem like we\u2019re making money off it.\u201d </p> <p>Though Johnson said he supports Clinton over Trump \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t see myself voting for him\u201d \u2013 he said the Republican nominee\u2019s relentless anti-trade rhetoric, elevating it to a major issue in the race, is the \u201conly thing I see in him that makes any sense\u201d. \u201cIf he [does] lose the election, he did offer something,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lawrence, the chief administrative officer at AlphaUSA, agreed there was some truth to the feeling that trade deals had contributed to the decline in the quality of life in the US, particularly for the middle class.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of these workers have seen jobs leave this country and go to other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve certainly seen that in the automotive marketplace.\u201d</p> <p>But trade has its advantages, Lawrence said, and no deal should be viewed as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d alone.</p> <p>\u201cTrade agreements happen not just so we can find the lowest cost to produce our products,\u201d he said, noting that deals also create customers for American companies and open access to foreign resources.</p> <p>To Lawrence, deals are made in the details: \u201cIt\u2019s how we write them \u2013 and how do we come to the table with those other countries, take a leadership position, and make something that works for everyone. And that\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s certainly possible.\u201d</p> <p>For politicians back in Washington, the trick will be to convince voters that deals can be in their interests.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that over the years the interest of American corporations and the interests of Americans have diverged,\u201d Alden, of the Council on Foreign Relations, said. \u201cOne of the mistakes is that corporate American has just said: \u2018If it\u2019s good for us, it\u2019s good for America,\u2019 and the approach needs to be more sophisticated than that. They need to show how it will help workers, too.\u201d</p>",

The combination of limited public access to information and seemingly unlimited advertising enabled companies to present themselves as caring environmental stewards, even as they were engaging in environmentally unsustainable practices.</p> <p>But greenwashing dates back even earlier. American electrical behemoth Westinghouse\u2019s nuclear power division was a greenwashing pioneer. Threatened by the 1960\u2019s anti-nuclear movement, which raised questions about its safety and environmental impact, it fought back with a series of ads proclaiming the cleanliness and safety of nuclear power plants. One, featuring a photograph of a <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/162185351/1969-westinghouse-building-nuclear-power\">nuclear plant nestled by a pristine lake</a>, proclaimed that \u201cWe\u2019re building nuclear power plants to give you more electricity,\u201d and went on to say that nuclear plants were \u201codorless [...] neat, clean, and safe\u201d.</p> <p>Some of these claims were true: in 1969, Westinghouse nuclear plants were producing large amounts of cheap electricity with far less air pollution than competing coal plants. However, given that the ads appeared after nuclear meltdowns had already occurred in <a href=\"http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/29/u-s-nuclear-plant-had-partial-meltdown-years-before-three-mile-island/\">Michigan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/benchmarks-january-3-1961-three-men-die-nuclear-reactor-meltdown\">Idaho</a>, the word \u201csafe\u201d was arguable. Westinghouse\u2019s ads also ignored concerns about the <a href=\"http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_6/wellockvol6.htm\">environmental impact of nuclear waste</a>, which has <a href=\"http://www.nap.edu/read/9674/chapter/2#2\">continued to be a problem</a>.<br></p> <h2>The mysterious case of the stolen towels</h2> <p>In 1983, when Jay Westerveld first got the idea for the term greenwashing, he wasn\u2019t thinking about nuclear power \u2013 he was thinking about towels. An undergraduate student on a research trip to Samoa, he stopped off in Fiji to surf. At the sprawling <a href=\"http://www.beachcomberfiji.com/\">Beachcomber Resort</a>, he saw a note asking customers to pick up their towels. \u201cIt basically said that the oceans and reefs are an important resource, and that reusing the towels would reduce ecological damage,\u201d Westerveld recalls. \u201cThey finished by saying something like, \u2018Help us to help our environment\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Westerveld wasn\u2019t actually staying at the resort \u2013 he was lodging at a \u201cgrubby\u201d guesthouse nearby, and had just snuck in to steal some clean towels. Even so, he was struck by the note\u2019s irony: while it claimed to be protecting the island\u2019s ecosystem, he says, the Beachcomber \u2013 which, today, describes itself as \u201cthe most <a href=\"http://www.beachcomberfiji.com/\">sought-after destination in the South Pacific</a>\u201d \u2013 was expanding. \u201cI don\u2019t think they really cared all that much about the coral reefs,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were in the middle of expanding at the time, and were building more bungalows.\u201d</p> <p>Three years later, in 1986, when he was writing a term paper on multiculturalism, Westerveld remembered the note. \u201cI finally wrote something like, \u2018It all comes out in the greenwash.\u2019 A guy in the class with me worked for a literary magazine and had me write an essay about it.\u201d And, as the magazine had a large readership in nearby New York City, it wasn\u2019t long before the term caught on in the wider media.</p> <p>Westerveld\u2019s essay came out a year after the launch of Chevron\u2019s People Do campaign. As <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/10/the-failure-of-chevrons-new-we-agree-ad-campaign/64951/\">critics later pointed out</a>, many of the environmental programs that Chevron promoted in its campaign were mandated by law. They were also relatively inexpensive when compared with the cost of Chevron\u2019s ad budget: environmental activist <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=2CHLmPx2PJ0C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=Chevron+%22People+do%22+campaign+criticism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Re5kl9yUqZ&amp;sig=MBqepaSKX5BV_nZm0mGhdmDWVls&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS4Mz2h5nOAhWDNx4KHSrxCokQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Chevron%20%22People%20do%22%20campaign%20criticism&amp;f=false\">Joshua Karliner estimated</a> that Chevron\u2019s butterfly preserve cost it $5,000 per year to run, while the ads promoting it cost millions of dollars to produce and broadcast.</p> <p>The People Do campaign also ignored Chevron\u2019s spotty environmental record: while it was running the ads, it <a href=\"http://www.corp-research.org/chevron\">was also violating</a> the clean air act, the clean water act and <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-14/entertainment/ca-42437_1_chevron-ads\">spilling oil into wildlife refuges</a>. But Chevron was far from the only company digging deep into the greenwashing cesspool. In 1989, chemical company DuPont announced its new double-hulled oil tankers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJZFfeLRCJs\">with ads featuring marine animals clapping their flippers and wings in chorus to Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy</a>. However, as environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth pointed out in its report Hold the Applause, the company was <a href=\"http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1991/10/doyle.html\">the single largest corporate polluter in the US</a>.</p> <p>Other corporate claims were equally outrageous: forestry giant <a href=\"http://fair.org/extra/tv-lets-corporations-pull-green-wool-over-viewers-eyes/\">Weyerhaeuser</a> ran ads claiming that it was \u201cserious\u201d about caring for fish \u2013 even as it was <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/logging-and-landslides-what-went-wrong/\">cutting down trees in some of its forests</a> and <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/1994/0730/01091.html\">destabilizing salmon habitats</a>. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bReBO55XzZc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bReBO55XzZc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Muddying the waters</h2> <p>By the early 1990s, consumers were wising up to sustainability concerns: polls showed that companies\u2019 <a href=\"http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/11303/volumes/ap01/AP-01\">environmental records</a> <a href=\"http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=243#3\">influenced the majority of consumer purchases</a>. This interest in the environment brought an increased awareness of the greenwashing; by the end of the decade, the word had officially entered the English language with its inclusion in the <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/greenwash\">Oxford English Dictionary</a>. Since then, the trend has only increased: a 2015 Nielsen poll showed that 66% of global consumers are willing to <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2015/the-sustainability-imperative.html\">pay more for environmentally sustainable products</a>. Among <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/green-generation-millennials-say-sustainability-is-a-shopping-priority.html\">millennials</a>, that number jumps to 72%.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are getting more aware of the rarity of the Earth and the ways that our actions impact it,\u201d says Jason Ballard, CEO of sustainable home improvement retailer<a href=\"https://treehouse.co/\"> TreeHouse</a>. At the same time, he notes, greenwashing has become more complex. \u201cIt\u2019s the dark side of a very positive development,\u201d he says.</p> <p>One shift has been outreach. Many companies are now working to engage customers in their sustainability efforts, even as their core business model remains environmentally unsustainable. <a href=\"http://www.ecooptions.homedepot.com/healthy-home/recycling/\">The Home Depot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lowes.com/cd_Helping+the+Environment+With+Recycling+Centers_368967519_\">Lowes</a>, for example, both encourage customers to do their part by offering onsite recycling for several products, including compact fluorescent lights and plastic bags. Meanwhile, they continue to sell <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/102714/home-depots-profitability-unvarnished-truth.asp\">billions of dollars</a> per year worth of environmentally damaging products, such as paints that are loaded with toxic ingredients and <a href=\"http://www.hercenter.org/facilitiesandgrounds/paints.cfm\">which release noxious fumes</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s misdirection, and it\u2019s intended to shift the customer\u2019s focus from a company\u2019s appalling behaviors to something that\u2019s peripheral,\u201d Ballard says. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJZFfeLRCJs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zJZFfeLRCJs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>The bottled water conundrum</strong></h2> <p>Another trend, says Jonah Sachs, CEO of branding agency<a href=\"https://freerange.com/\"> Free Range Studios</a>, is linking sustainability claims to other issues, such as personal health. \u201cThere\u2019s this perception that personal health and environmental sustainability are two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes this is true, but many times it isn\u2019t. Bottled water is a great example: in terms of health, it\u2019s much better than soda or other drinks, but in terms of the environment and sustainability, it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>The water industry <a href=\"http://www.springtothetap.org/2013/04/earth-week-greenwashing-in-bottled.html\">trades heavily on images of rugged mountains and pristine lakes to sell its products</a>.

  "<p>What a difference a week makes. Seven days after Garry Monk lambasted his players for an \u201cunacceptable\u201d home defeat that lacked heart or desire, the Leeds manager found himself hailing a performance that brought back the pride in a derby victory at Hillsborough.</p> <p>Monk, whose job security has come under scrutiny since an opening 3-0 defeat at QPR, was able to say: \u201cWe were the better team against a very good Wednesday side that is one of the benchmarks in this division.\u201d Nor was he wrong. Leeds thoroughly deserved the first win of the season that came via goals from the strikers Marcus Antonsson and Chris Wood.</p> <p>The former Swansea manager has been around long enough to understand the ebbs and flows. \u201cWe\u2019re still not the team we want to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go but we\u2019re improving with every game. This performance will give them belief. You can see the potential but this league is unforgiving and there will be setbacks.\u201d</p> <p>Monk refused even to consider the effect on the club\u2019s owner, Massimo Cellino, who is notoriously trigger-happy \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve a year\u2019s contract and I\u2019m very focused on my job \u2013 I\u2019m trying to develop them as quickly as possible but it takes time\u201d \u2013 and insisted the day belonged to the players who celebrated with Leeds fans at the end.</p> <p>In fact the stage had been set for a triumphant return of Wednesday\u2019s prodigal, with their favourite son, Fernando Forestieri, reinstated after going awol, but instead it belonged to Antonsson, the 25-year-old striker signed from Sweden this summer, and Wood, who shrugged off the jeers that followed his substitution in last week\u2019s defeat by Birmingham.</p> <p>Forestieri, the player they call the Little Maestro around Hillsborough, was back in the team after last week\u2019s unedifying episode and looking like a man keen to make up for lost time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/20/burnley-v-liverpool-watford-v-chelsea-and-more-football-clockwatch-live\">Burnley v Liverpool, Watford v Chelsea and more: football clockwatch \u2013\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having refused to travel to Norwich, with rumours rife about strong interest from Newcastle and Derby, Forestieri, told that he was going nowhere by the owner, Dejphon Chansiri, sat on the naughty bench in midweek to watch the 2-1 defeat at Burton.</p> <p>If there was any suggestion he might have fallen out of favour with supporters, that was dispelled by the cheer that greeted his name when the teams were announced and he set about reassuring any wavering hearts with a typical performance.</p> <p>That he was not rewarded with a goal for his first-half efforts was down to the Leeds centre-half Liam Cooper, who headed off the line when Forestieri rounded the goalkeeper, Rob Green, before shooting from an angle, as much as his own wayward finishing when he side-footed past a post after Charlie Taylor\u2019s mistake let him in.</p> <p>The Leeds fans\u2019 taunting chant of \u201cForestieri, he doesn\u2019t want to play\u201d soon disappeared but so too did Wednesday\u2019s dominance as Leeds came into the picture after an anxious opening 20 minutes.</p> <p>Ronaldo Vieira, unlikely ever to live up to his illustrious football mash-up name, did his best to engineer a Leeds lead but his fine through-ball found Hadi Sacko only for the Frenchman to steer past Keiren Westwood at a pace that left him unable to keep it in play. Vieira also played Antonsson in for a reasonable chance a minute later only to see his team-mate fire wide in haste.</p> <p>In the end it was Wednesday who almost went into the interval ahead, with Daniel Pudil\u2019s carefully flighted free-kick from outside the box clipping the top of the crossbar five minutes before the break.</p> <p>Carlos Carvalhal, the Wednesday manager, sent on Gary Hooper, a player with a good scoring record against Leeds, but it was Monk\u2019s side that eventually broke the deadlock, turning defence into attack on 63 minutes, with to work the ball upfield following Taylor\u2019s initial break from the last third, until Sacko\u2019s cross reacheding the unmarked Antonsson for a diving header at the far post that he could hardly miss.</p> <p>Leeds, superbly led by captain and centre-half Liam Cooper, sealed their victory on 84 minutes when the substitute Kemar Roofe crossed for Wood to finish clinically in front of the Leeds fans massed on the Leppings Lane end.</p>",
  "<p>It may no longer be called the Britannia Stadium but this was one of those days that served as a reminder that the home of Stoke remains an intimidating venue for visiting opponents. The crowd is boisterous, the conditions are gusty and the team in red and white are no mugs. Yet none of that could stop Manchester City from recording a victory that maintains their perfect start under Pep Guardiola and suggests they are indeed intent on making their mark on all fronts this season.</p> <p>The visitors came through a frantic and full-blooded affair that was a throwback to the days when Tony Pulis was in charge of Stoke and those occasions, like last season, when City found themselves overwhelmed at the ground now known as the bet365 Stadium. But here City played with poise, grit and a level of ruthlessness that enabled them largely to dominate proceedings and make it 11 goals scored in three matches.</p> <p>Sergio Ag\u00fcero has six of those having added two goals here to the one he got against Sunderland on the first day of the season and the hat-trick he scored in the 5-0 blitz of Steaua Bucharest in midweek. The opener was a penalty, one of two awarded by the referee, Mike Dean, who was simply enforcing to the letter the directives issued prior to the new campaign for officials to be tougher on grappling inside the area. Ryan Shawcross was penalised for the incident that led to Ag\u00fcero opening the scoring, with Raheem Sterling the man punished prior to Bojan Krkic converting for Stoke shortly after half-time.</p> <p>Dean has developed a reputation for trying to make himself the centre of attention yet he made the correct call on both incidents and the only black spot in regards to his performance was his failure to award Stoke a penalty after Aleksandar Kolarov clearly fouled Joe Allen inside the City area shortly before half-time. That could have proved a decisive moment but ultimately the visitors deserved their victory, one decorated by two late close-range goals from the substitute Nolito.</p> <p>\u201cWe suffer five minutes after they score but after that they didn\u2019t create many chances and we had a great performance,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cIt is impossible to come here and for 90 minutes control the game but we created a lot and we saw again amazing team spirit.\u201d</p> <p>There was a clear resilience running through the visitors\u2019 ranks and perhaps no single moment typified that better than when Jes\u00fas Navas charged back into his own area on 58 minutes to prevent Marko Arnautovic from having a shot on goal. A player not renowned for his battling qualities was suddenly transformed into Tony Adams.</p> <p>And while City may not have performed with the swagger they displayed against Bucharest there was still much to admire in the way the team continued to build from the back, the centre-backs John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi splitting and playing the ball into midfield where David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne used it with intelligence and craft. Sterling, meanwhile, continues to dazzle and watching on from the bench yet again, Joe Hart could only contemplate what he will be missing should the goalkeeper, as expected, leave City before the end of the month.</p> <p>That is not to say Stoke were overwhelmed and for large parts of the first half they matched City\u2019s high-pressing tactics with their own desire to regain the ball and use it progressively, typified best by Allen, who was making his first start for Stoke since arriving from Liverpool.\u201cWe saw the energy and understanding of his game,\u201d said Mark Hughes of the Wales midfielder. \u201cI was pleased he was able to excel.\u201d</p> <p>Stoke\u2019s battling was undone on 27 minutes when Shawcross was spotted grabbing Otamendi\u2019s arm as the Argentinian looked to connect with De Bruyne\u2019s corner. Ag\u00fcero sent Shay Given the wrong way from the spot \u2013 a form of redemption given the striker missed two penalties in midweek \u2013 and scored again nine minutes later after glancing in De Bruyne\u2019s free-kick from an unmarked position inside the six-yard area.</p> <p>The hosts went from fired-up to frustrated and even more so after Dean failed to spot Kolarov\u2019s man-handling of Allen. Yet they were back in the match on 49 minutes after the referee this time spotted an infringement by a City player - Sterling put his hands on Shawcross as he attacked an Allen corner, and while the contact was minimal it was an infringement.</p> <p>\u201cWe know the directives and last year those penalties would not have been awarded,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cAs long as the referees are consistent I haven\u2019t got an issue with that but from experience I doubt that will be the case.\u201d</p> <p>Guardiola described the penalty decisions as \u201ca little strange\u201d yet ultimately he departed from here a happy man. \u201cIt is impossible to say what we can achieve but in the short time together, they [the players] show me how intelligent they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a lot of quality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/pep-guardiola-claudio-bravo-joe-hart-manchester-city-sevilla\">Pep Guardiola hopes to sign Barcelona\u2019s Claudio Bravo this week</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"243e8491c13fdf31bf4904b10c3b347cecc8bcf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/243e8491c13fdf31bf4904b10c3b347cecc8bcf8/0_120_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nolito\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nolito scores Manchester City\u2019s third goal, and his first, in the win against Stoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/20/stoke-city-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live\">Stoke City 1-4 Manchester City: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>",

Bannon has no experience running a campaign, but a number of employees who left Breitbart under his stewardship had warnings for campaign staff: expect expletive-laced phone calls at all hours of the night.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be screaming matches between Steve and every other person in the office,\u201d said Ben Shapiro, a former editor at Breitbart News. </p> <p>\u201cBut there will be no screaming matches between Steve and Trump. Steve knows where his bread is buttered.\u201d</p> <p>A steady stream of emails leaked in the days following Trump\u2019s hiring of Bannon paint a picture of a shrewd businessman with a scorched-earth approach to the Republican establishment. Former Breitbart staffers interviewed by the Guardian recall a man driven less by an ideological crusade than the desire to emerge on top \u2013 not unlike the candidate who now employs him.</p> <p>To some, the Trump-Bannon partnership simply marks the consummation of a long, happy rapport. During his tenure as the executive chairman of Breitbart, Bannon spent the greater part of the last year promoting Trump\u2019s candidacy: where others fled or scolded Trump\u2019s declaration that Mexican immigrants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">\u201crapists\u201d and \u201ckillers\u201d</a>, Breitbart News echoed the call.</p> <p>Bannon was a presence in the newsroom, often hopping on daily editorial calls and making his views clear. Staff present for the discussions, including Shapiro and Kurt Bardella, who previously served as a media consultant to Breitbart, said Bannon aggressively pushed stories against immigrants, and supported linking minorities to terrorism and crime. </p> <p>It was catnip for the site\u2019s growing audience of the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d, a far-right group that merges race and nationalism and has largely embraced Trump. For all his antagonism toward the media, the Republican nominee has publicly lavished praise on Breitbart, even though his former campaign manager Corey Lewandoski was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/14/breitbart-writers-resign-trump-manager-assault-reporter-michelle-fields\">charged with battery</a> against one of the website\u2019s reporters, Michelle Fields, when she tried to ask Trump a question.</p> <p>Bannon, rather than defend Fields, used Breitbart as a vehicle to discredit her story and her character. Fields resigned, as did Shapiro and Bardella.</p> <p>\u201cThat was really a crystallization of how his pursuit of a relationship with Trump superseded the welfare of his reporters,\u201d Bardella said. \u201cIt was that moment of clarity where they\u2019re so in for Trump that they\u2019re willing to throw one of their own overboard even when that person is the victim of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Shapiro soon rebranded Breitbart as \u201cTrump Pravda\u201d, and said that many staffers were increasingly concerned about their future. The site was spinning away from its crusade to hold liberal media and establishment Republicans to account, they felt. They worried about instead turning into shills for the Trump campaign. </p> <p>It was not just the obvious support for Trump that troubled employees, but also the clear objective of Bannon to diminish the former reality TV star\u2019s opponents in the Republican primary. The website ran overwhelmingly unfavorable coverage of Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, both established Florida politicians, especially with articles about the bilingual candidates\u2019 support for immigration reform.</p> <p>\u201cHis whole mindset in general was: \u2018We need to go after Rubio, we need to go after Bush,\u2019\u201d said Bardella.</p> <p>The focus on Rubio was particularly relentless, as the Florida senator emerged as one of the final candidates in the race. Stories ran near daily with headlines asserting that, if Rubio were elected president, immigrants and terrorists would stream across the US border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acac04ea7fb13264e590a102eda46c8812e3035f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acac04ea7fb13264e590a102eda46c8812e3035f/0_0_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Rubio: a friend to immigrants and terrorists, according to Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Rubio: a friend to immigrants and terrorists, according to Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Sladky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe hates Marco,\u201d said one former employee, who requested anonymity to speak freely. \u201cThere was definitely a decision to promote the work of writers with an extreme anti-Rubio bent.\u201d</p> <p>Similar treatment has been directed toward House speaker Paul Ryan in recent months, with Bannon working behind the scenes to push his long-shot primary challenger, Paul Nehlen. One story criticized Ryan for having a fence around his home in Wisconsin, with the implication that the speaker was willing to wall off his own house but not the US border. </p> <p>Bannon was \u201cabsolutely fuelling the energy\u201d behind Nehlen, a former staffer said. </p> <p>Spokespeople for Ryan and Rubio declined to comment.</p> <p>Even Ted Cruz, an ultraconservative senator once covered favorably by Breitbart, was not spared the site\u2019s acidic treatment of Trump\u2019s opponents. A report published by the Hill <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/292028-how-breitbart-turned-on-ted-cruz\">detailed</a> how Bannon slowly turned against the Texas senator. In particular, Breitbart seized on Trump\u2019s attacks on Cruz\u2019s citizenship \u2013 the senator was born to an American mother in Canada \u2013 much in the way it spread false \u201cbirther\u201d ideas against Barack Obama.</p> <p>It was a remarkable turnaround, given that just under a year prior, Breitbart reporter Matthew Boyle had been invited to observe Cruz\u2019s bedtime ritual with his children \u2013 and subsequently produced <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/23/exclusive-photos-potential-first-family-gets-ready-for-bed-before-sen-cruzs-presidential-campaign-announcement/\">a report</a> portraying the senator in a glowing light.</p> <p>Although they criticized his methods, those who worked under Bannon acknowledged a tireless devotion to creating an empire too influential to ignore, and his success so far.</p> <p>Given its popularity among grassroots conservatives and Bannon\u2019s \u201ctake-no prisoners\u201d approach, few Republican candidates or lawmakers are brazen enough to pick a fight with the website.</p> <p>Both Rubio and Bush continued to engage with Breitbart during the Republican primary, for example, even as they were targeted by much of its coverage. </p> <p>At the height of the primary, a visibly frustrated Rubio mocked Breitbart\u2019s credibility on Fox News, <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/02/20/rubio-slams-breitbart-after-publishing-scathing-remarks-by-immigration-union-president-theyre-basically-conspiracy-theories/\">accusing them</a> of publishing \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d. He has nonetheless continued to provide at least some of their reporters with interviews dubbed exclusives.</p> <p>Bannon \u201chas taken where the Breitbart brand essentially was before the election \u2013 considered by many as outliers \u2013 and made it a sheer force of will\u201d, Bardella said. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to advance an agenda.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now he\u2019s the right-hand person to a would-be president.\u201d</p> <p>Though Bannon has only had a few days in charge of Trump\u2019s campaign, his former employees said he would stand in stark contrast to former chairman Paul Manafort, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">who resigned on Friday</a>. While Manafort tried to steer Trump toward a more moderate general election strategy, little will be off limits for Bannon, they said.</p> <p>His motto, as Shapiro put it, will be simple: \u201cLet Trump be Trump.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Per tradition, the men\u2019s marathon will help close out this year\u2019s Olympic Games.

But, ahead of Sunday\u2019s race, we\u2019ve excerpted some key passages from the interview below. </p> <p>The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p> <p><strong>The Guardian: Let\u2019s start with this year\u2019s games. What are you and Meb [Keflezighi] looking forward to about Rio? What is Meb hoping to accomplish?</strong></p> <p>Bob Larsen: No American has ever made the Olympic marathon team at age 40, which Meb did in the trials. He\u2019s now 41. We have to be realistic that he can\u2019t do some of the things in a marathon that he could when he was younger. But his endurance is still quite high and he\u2019ll be ready to handle the heat, which he does quite well.<br></p> <p>At his age, he\u2019s had the experience, so the race won\u2019t overwhelm him. And he has a good backup crew \u2013 myself and others \u2013 that are there for him. We\u2019ll have him ready to do his best. In the race itself, he has to make good decisions, as he normally does, based on the weather, based on the surging that other guys do.<br></p> <p>Obviously you\u2019d love to see Meb in position to have another shot at a medal. Whether he can do that again? I would hope so. I know he\u2019s got the willpower, I know he\u2019s as tough as anybody, and we\u2019ll find out on the 21st of August.</p> <p><strong>What are some of the main challenges facing marathon runners in Rio? You mentioned weather \u2026</strong></p> <p>The challenge will be the really warm weather and fairly high humidity. It is their winter, but if it follows the normal pattern for weather for Rio that day, traditionally, on August 21 it\u2019ll be in the high 70s Fahrenheit, humidity in the 75-85% range.</p> <p>That\u2019s warm for a marathon. You have to be a little bit more cautious as to how difficult the pace is going to be, knowing that it\u2019s going to be a warm day. Ideally, you\u2019d want it a little bit under 50F. When it\u2019s cooler, you use less energy, but that won\u2019t be the case, certainly, in Rio.</p> <p>Otherwise, this marathon in Rio is relatively flat. There\u2019s a little bit of an incline in one area but essentially it\u2019s a pretty level, straightforward run. You do a 10,000m loop three times and then you run back to the start/finish line.

Not to psych up but psych down, for hopefully the first 20 miles, so that they\u2019re not using extra energy on what\u2019s going on but just relax.</p> <p>Now obviously, if a competitor goes out really hard at the beginning or they surge \u2013 and more and more we see this in elite races \u2013 then you\u2019ve got to respond and figure out whether you\u2019re gonna go with him or stay back. Those decisions are crucial too.</p> <p>The most important part of the race will be that last 10,000m (6.2miles). So you don\u2019t want to use up too much energy on your way to 20 miles. Once you get to 20, then you have to make even quicker decisions as to what you\u2019re going to do with surging or to cover surges or whether you want to push the pace yourself, especially if you don\u2019t think you have the speed to get in front of people or to beat them at the end of the race. So there\u2019s a lot that goes into this. Tactics are very important.</p> <p>If you make a major mistake and go too hard too early and overheat the body then you\u2019re pretty much cooked. You\u2019re maybe not going to be able to do much or be there at the end of the race.</p> <p>What you\u2019re trying to do is put yourself in position with 10,000m to go, if you feel you have a chance at the medal, to give yourself the best opportunity to get one of those three medals.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the difference between how a casual runner would approach a marathon versus an elite runner, like Meb?</strong></p> <p>A recreational runner is not so concerned with placement so he can be more aware of exactly what would work well for him to run his fastest race.</p> <p>One of the best ways of doing that is to start out the first five miles a little slower than what you think you can average all the way through the race. Because for your first five miles you tend to get a little excited, and go too fast, and also you\u2019re not as efficient as you are after you get a little bit more warmed up. So those first five miles, it\u2019s very critical that you hold back.</p> <p>Then in the middle, you\u2019re trying to run a little bit faster than what your average pace overall will be for the duration of the race.</p> <p>And then last five miles, or the last 10,000m, you\u2019re hopeful that you can run duplicating the first part of the race. And that\u2019s an efficient way to run it when you\u2019re not racing against other people. </p> <p>With elite athletes you don\u2019t have those choices. Because if you\u2019re going to stay with people, the race could suddenly change at any point and you\u2019ve got to be ready. So there isn\u2019t one set pattern that an athlete is going to have going into the race. He has to make decisions as he runs.<br></p> <p>Ideally you go out a little bit slow, like the recreational runner would do, run fast in the middle, and hope for the best the last few miles. Or certainly, in the Olympic games, you\u2019d love to get a medal, and the top athletes are all trying to do that.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the runner\u2019s mental state during such a demanding race? I imagine elite athletes can\u2019t afford to daydream.</strong></p> <p>An elite runner is constantly monitoring what he\u2019s doing: what the splits are; is he doing the right pace; what other people are doing around him; and concentrating on perfecting the stride and upper body mechanics so he\u2019s as efficient as he possibly can be.</p> <p>The recreational runner can afford to think about a lot of different things \u2013 and that might be an advantage because you\u2019re out there for so long in a marathon that you really don\u2019t have to think about the mechanics. Just stay relaxed, make sure you\u2019re staying within the pace you should be on. Other than that, just enjoy running out there with your friends, and even chatting and stuff like that. I think that\u2019s fine.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the difference between that casual level of runner and that elite runner: the elite runner is almost like monitoring a race car, where you\u2019re constantly paying attention to what\u2019s going on and you\u2019re very alert and trying to stay on top of things.</p> <p><strong>What sets Meb apart?</strong></p> <p>One of Meb\u2019s assets is that he still thinks clearly at the end of a race. Your oxygen is going to your legs and your heart to keep the body moving forward, so people get to a point where they don\u2019t want to think or they\u2019re not making real good decisions many times.</p> <p>Meb, even late in the race when he\u2019s being pressured, he still makes good decisions. That really separates him from a lot of runners. He can push himself to keep going hard even when there\u2019s a lot of pain and discomfort at that point in the race. And he is monitoring other people and looking for signs that their technique is faltering or they are breathing harder. He\u2019s just looking for weaknesses in other people in that last 10,000m.</p> <p>When he won the Boston Marathon the year after the bombing, he was out by himself in front \u2026 and the two Kenyans are coming at him very fast and they get within five seconds late in the race, in the last couple of miles, and Meb is going in his mind through everything that he has to do right. That his stride mechanics has to be exact, that\u2019s he\u2019s got to be very careful how he\u2019s placing his foot, his knee coming up and coming off of his heel really quickly \u2013 those types of things that he works on all the time. He does drills almost every day, so that really paid off for him. </p> <p>He\u2019s still got to stay relaxed, and he\u2019s reminding himself of all those things. And then the two Kenyans who are closing on him, who had to run really fast for the previous 10,000m to catch him, now they\u2019re getting a little bit sloppy, their bodies are twisting, they\u2019re not using their arms as efficiently, their knees are no longer coming up as well.</p> <p>And in some ways that was the difference, with Meb executing his technique throughout the race and especially in those last few miles. In a very close race, he was able to hold them off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\" data-alt=\"RioRun promo\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\">RioRun promo</a> </figure>",

  "<p>Rhiannon Beauregard, 33, is visiting New York for a few days. But the sex and marriage therapist is not here for a vacation, to see the sights or visit friends in the city where she once went to college. She is here to freeze her eggs.</p> <p>Beauregard lives in Austin, Texas where she runs her own practice, but has opted to come to New York to use the services offered by <a href=\"http://extendfertility.com/\">Extend Fertility</a>. The clinic is the first of its kind \u2013 focusing only on egg freezing and not offering any other fertility services and treatments such as in vitro fertilization. By doing that, the clinic has been able to cut costs of its services to $5,000 while offering personalized service to each one of its clients.</p> <p>One of the barriers to egg freezing becoming mainstream is the cost. The procedure was still deemed to be experimental until just a few years ago and was mostly an accepted way to extend fertility for older women, cancer patients or those diagnosed with fertility disorders. </p> <p>Since it is considered to be an elective procedure, egg freezing is typically not covered by health insurance. The average cost of the procedure is <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/freeze-eggs/\">about $10,000</a> with an additional $2,000 to $5,000 for the necessary medication and another couple of thousand dollars for storage. If the frozen eggs are actually to be used for IVF later on, that would cost <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2014/02/06/the-cost-of-ivf-4-things-i-learned-while-battling-infertility/#c2519092a797\">an additional $12,000</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/19/silicon-valley-egg-freezing-perks-hiring-women\">Silicon Valley tries egg-freezing perks. How about just hiring more women?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Altogether, that adds up to more than $25,000 \u2013 not exactly chump change. Aware of the costs, two years ago, Facebook and Apple announced that they would cover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/14/apple-facebook-pay-women-employees-freeze-eggs\">up to $20,000 in costs</a> for any female employee that wanted to freeze their eggs.</p> <p>While Extend Fertility is unable to cut the costs of medicine (the clients are required to pay for it on their own) or the future costs of IVF, its founders hope that by cutting the cost of the initial procedure in half they will make the procedure accessible for more women. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s expensive either way. We know that,\u201d says Joshua Klein, co-founder and chief medical officer of Extend Fertility. He points out that $5,000 is still half as expensive as $10,000 and adds that the Extend is \u201cworking with financing partners\u201d so that those interested could opt to pay $200 or $300 a month for a while instead of a one-time payment. \u201cWe are trying to be innovative and thoughtful about that,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d838b809bc4ce8d45c75bc3eb3cd6f0a5b09a60a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d838b809bc4ce8d45c75bc3eb3cd6f0a5b09a60a/119_0_729_564/500.jpg\" alt=\"Joshua Klein, co-founder and chief medical officer of Extend Fertility\" width=\"500\" height=\"387\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joshua Klein, co-founder and chief medical officer of Extend Fertility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Extend Fertility</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Should women view egg freezing as some kind of down payment on their future? Klein would prefer that they think of it an investment for both the future and the present. Many women worry about meeting the right guy because \u201cthey hear that biological clock ticking loudly\u201d, he says. That ticking is a stress factor in their lives. By freezing their eggs and knowing that they have preserved their fertility, they can silence that ticking and receive the immediate benefit of \u201cpeace of mind\u201d.</p> <p>On 8 August, two days before the clinic officially opened, Beauregard was on the fourth day of her pill regiment.</p> <p>Beauregard has to inject herself daily with some very expensive drugs. Prior to starting the regimen, she had to come off her birth control pills, which resulted in a couple of days of feeling \u201cweepy\u201d. She is bloated and on the mornings that she goes in for checkups at Extend, she ends up watching an ultrasound of her uterus \u2013 staring at her eggs instead of a baby.</p> <p>However, she says, the staff at Extend have been extremely supportive. Every client is assigned their own fertility specialist and is available to accompany them to all of their meetings. The Extend office, just a block or two south of Central Park, also does not resemble a typical fertility clinic. The walls are light blue. The rooms look more like small conference rooms with round tables and a handful of chairs. There are no big tables with stirrups, no posters with uteri or models of babies nestled in a uterus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64921b002487d0ae758c62bc86c0938846f79d25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64921b002487d0ae758c62bc86c0938846f79d25/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A meeting room at Extend Fertility.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A meeting room at Extend Fertility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Extend Fertility</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEven the way this room is set up, we are trying to build into our experience the idea that this is not an illness thing, that we are not trying to cure a disease,\u201d says Klein, sitting in one of the meeting rooms. \u201cHere we don\u2019t want to make people feel that they have a problem. They are just a woman living in the 21st century, coming to the doctor about preserving options for the future. It shouldn\u2019t feel like a problem.\u201d</p> <p>For some, it might be a combination of the two. A while back Beauregard was diagnosed with <a href=\"http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/polycystic-ovary-syndrome.html\">polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS</a>) \u2013 an disorder that affects hormone production and can affect woman\u2019s fertility in women of reproductive age. She was 32 at that time and single.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really have any plans to go out and find me a partner to have a child with,\u201d she says. She began thinking about what would happen over the next 10 years. PCOS can lead to complications during pregnancy, increased chances of miscarriage, infertility and high levels of estrogen, which can cause cancer of the uterine lining.<strong> </strong>Beauregard realized that if she wants to have children in the future, she might have to undergo treatments such as IVF at that time. \u201cI started to think about what the difference would be between now and later and the biggest difference between now and later is that after 35 my eggs start to ... age, I guess, for the lack of better term.\u201d</p> <p>Klein agrees.</p> <p>\u201cWe know without a shadow of the doubt that when you freeze eggs when you are younger, you are going to be putting away something that\u2019s much, much, much more likely to be helpful for you than if you wait to do it as a reactionary measure when you are older,\u201d he says.</p> <p>According to him, the profile of women interested in egg freezing is slowly shifting from \u201cpanic-mode 40-year old\u201d to \u201ca proactive smart-thing-to-do-because-I am-a-young-aspiring-woman 30-year-old\u201d. Fertility company EggBanxx, which targets younger career-focused women with slogans like \u201cLean in, but freeze first!\u201d, estimates that by 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/25/turning-back-biological-clock-comes-at-price-egg-freezing\">76,000 women will have frozen their eggs</a>.</p> <p>Beauregard says she would have eventually considered freezing her eggs even without the PCOS diagnosis.</p> <p>\u201cSince I am single now I don\u2019t want to put that kind of pressure on a new relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t frozen my eggs, it would be one of the first things we talk about: \u2018Hey, how do you feel about kids? Because we have to start making decisions in the next four to five years.\u2019 I feel like a lot of pressure has been lifted off of me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/21/women-fertility-egg-freezing\">I had my eggs frozen.

While researching her options, she often felt that this was a moneymaking scheme for doctors and clinics. </p> <p>The $5,000 price tag at Extend seemed affordable in comparison. Despite that, the procedure and the drugs cost all her savings.</p> <p>\u201cMost women in their mid-30s do not have a large savings to fall back on and because we do not have any other support like a partner. The big risk for me was less about the procedure and more about \u2018OK, I don\u2019t have any savings left\u2019,\u201d she says.

It turned out to be closer to a couple of thousand dollars, instead. Additionally, she has to pay for storing of her eggs. At Extend, storage for one year costs $450. For five years, it\u2019s $2,000 and $3,500 for 10.</p> <p>To Talia Zapolanski, freezing her eggs is akin to an insurance policy. </p> <p>Zapolanski, who worked in finance for 11 years and now works for a real estate investment firm, had been thinking of doing this for about a year and had gone in for a consultation at another hospital before being referred to Extend by a friend of one of the clinic\u2019s doctors.</p> <p>\u201cI definitely know that I want children. That\u2019s something I feel strongly about. I haven\u2019t found the right person yet. I am not dating anyone now and I don\u2019t know when I will find the right person,\u201d says the 33-year-old New Yorker. \u201cYou start hearing a lot more about egg freezing these days and I thought I would look into it. It seems like a good idea. Hopefully I will be able to, when the time comes, get pregnant and have kids the natural way but you never know.\u201d</p> <p>Egg freezing should not be one of those things that we don\u2019t talk about, according to both Beauregard and Zapolanski.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was telling people that I was freezing my eggs, a lot of people didn\u2019t know what to say. It makes people uncomfortable \u2013 eventually they will get curious about it, but a lot of people are a little dumbfounded that I am so open about it,\u201d said Beauregard. \u201cI want to make sure that people feel comfortable talking about these options.\u201d</p> <p>Zapolanski says she has encouraged \u201cno less than five friends to go do the same\u201d.</p> <p>Recently, when she was visiting Los Angeles, she shared with a friend from college that she recently froze her eggs.</p> <p>\u201cShe kind of paused and looked at me in shock that I had shared that and she said: \u2018I am glad you said that, I am about to go through the process and I am so nervous about and I have nobody to talk to\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very taboo subject.\u201d</p>",

In 2011, just as the spike began, the Texas state legislature cut $73.6m from the state\u2019s family planning budget of $111.5m. The two-thirds cut forced more than 80 family planning clinics to shut down across the state.

The researchers, hailing from the University of Maryland, Boston University\u2019s school of public health and Stanford University\u2019s medical school, called for further study.

Phelps notwithstanding, this was a young swim team, with a lot of veteran medalists (Natalie Coughlin, Tyler Clary) not making it through trials. Katie Ledecky and breaststroke champion Lilly King are just 19. Simone Manuel, who surprised with a silver in the 50m free and an Olympic record in the 100, has a couple more years of swimming with Ledecky at Stanford. Ryan Murphy, who swept the backstrokes and kicked off the medley relay with a world record, is barely 21.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the curious question of Missy Franklin, who took four gold medals at age 17 in London and followed up with six gold medals in the 2013 World Championships. She suffered a back injury, lost form and confidence, and didn\u2019t advance to the final in either of her individual events in Rio. She did pick up a relay gold, and she\u2019s still just 21, certainly young enough to rebound.</p> <p>On the track, the USA is watching another phenom of the past four years, Mary Cain, who burst onto the scene as a 16-year-old with a wide smile in 2012, not making the Olympics that year but smashing an assortment of middle-distance junior records. She made the US team for the 2013 world championships and advanced to the 1,500-meter final. But she has struggled since then and finished 11th at the Olympic trials, nowhere near her personal best. She\u2019s still just 21 in an event that favors older runners.</p> <p>Several collegians, along with high school hurdler Sydney McLaughlin, are poised to improve on their first Olympics. Hurdler Devon Allen, heptathlete Kendell Williams and sprinter Trayvon Bromell have shown potential and can now draw on experience from the Games. Triple jumper Keturah Orji set an American record and just missed the podium. Clay Murphy, less heralded than 800m team-mate Boris Berian and barely fast enough to get through the first round in Rio, took a surprise bronze medal.</p> <p>Women\u2019s gymnastics is typically a sport that doesn\u2019t reward repeat US Olympians, in part because the competition with the USA is so fierce. Gabby Douglas, the 2012 all-around champion at age 16, placed third in all-around qualifying in Rio but couldn\u2019t defend her title because countries are limited to two individuals per event. Simone Biles is just 19, but should she choose to go for more medals in Tokyo, she\u2019ll have to fend off 16-year-old teammate Laurie Hernandez and 16-year-old Olympic alternate Ragan Smith, along with any number of teens and tweens ready to emerge as Hernandez did this year.</p> <p>The women\u2019s soccer team, on the other hand, has gone through a rare transitional period with a few retirements and pregnancies. Whether the turnover continues depends in part on the ongoing labor negotiations, which will determine whether a small core of players continues to earn steady salaries. Crystal Dunn and Mallory Pugh look set to be influential attackers for years to come, but older players such as Carli Lloyd won\u2019t go quietly. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CarliLloyd/status/764213484355584001\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnBonini\">@JohnBonini</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SebiSalazarCSN\">@SebiSalazarCSN</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewDasNYT\">@AndrewDasNYT</a> and its people like you who I continuously prove wrong.

The women\u2019s basketball team will likely have a few openings with Tamika Catchings, Sue Bird, Lindsay Whalen and Diana Taurasi passing into their late 30s, but Elena Delle Donne and Brittney Griner will continue the progression as younger players come in. In rowing, the US women\u2019s eight continues to reload and win. The breakout stars in women\u2019s water polo include Princeton goalkeeper Ashleigh Johnson and attacker Maddie Musselman, who starts at UCLA after the Olympics.</p> <p>Even shooting benefits from a college presence. Ginny Thrasher, the first gold medalist of the Games, is already back on campus taking physics and electrical engineering at West Virginia, where a fraternity has <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espnw/culture/feature/article/17331670/join-olympic-shooter-ginny-thrasher-gold-medal-first-day-back-school-west-virginia\">offered up free drinks</a>.</p> <p>One sport in which a new college presence might help rejuvenate a stagnant talent pool is beach volleyball. The youngest US Olympian this year was 30-year-old Brooke Sweat; the other seven players are 34 or older. Young women, such as the promising pair of Lane Carico and Summer Ross, are starting to take advantage of new opportunities to play on sand in college before moving into the pro game.</p> <p>Yet some younger athletes may pursue a different path. Kanak Jha, the literal embodiment of a millennial (born June 2000), moved to Sweden to hone his table tennis game. He did not advance at the Olympics but showed glimpses of potential.</p> <p>Perhaps Jha will be the surprise of Tokyo, as Murphy and Thrasher were in Rio. Or maybe it will be a 12-year-old gymnast whose potential is just starting to catch the eye of insiders.</p> <p>Topping the 100-medal mark is never guaranteed. But the USA will have no shortage of fresh young faces to trot out in Tokyo.</p>",
  "<p>It was one of those days when we had jumped the gun putting Lycra on. We sat in the front room in our cycling shorts looking out at the rain, willing the other to suggest hibernation instead. Neither did, so when the deluge had dulled to a drizzle, out we went. There was a bicycle to be tested, after all.</p> <p>The Peak District lanes were wet, but it didn\u2019t really matter to me. The Ribble had excellent mudguards; my bottom would stay dry. The same could not be said for my face. My cycling companion that day was not only a mudguard refusenik but also far faster than me, which meant an afternoon chasing him down, <a href=\"https://ragtimecyclist.com/2014/01/28/biking-behaviour-part-12-the-wheel-sucker/\">sucking his wheel</a> and drinking puddle water until the sun came out. He is also a mountain biker, which meant a few ill-advised \u201cshall we just see where this one goes?\u201d diversions. One, past the Derbyshire village of Wash, involved pedalling up a gravelly stream and almost an early bath.</p> <p>Happily, the Ribble is a trooper, even if I am not. The 25mm tyres rolled along fine, even on rocky terrain. The skinny steel frame (Reynolds 525) soaked up the worst of the bumps without adding much weight. I was glad the manufacturers insisted I get the 44cm model, even though it looked fit for a Borrower. At 5ft 4in in my socks, I usually take a 51cm frame, but was assured, correctly, that the top tube would be long enough. The snug geometry really worked for me, allowing me to put out maximum power on the cranks when climbing out of the saddle. It also looked a delight, clearly aimed at the fashionable retro market, where carbon is the devil and steel rules supreme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/02/ikea-sladda-bicycle-review-helen-pidd\">On the road: Ikea Sladda bicycle review \u2013 \u2018Build your own Ikea bike?

  "<p>In an article heralding the new film of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/24/swallows-and-amazons-review-kelly-macdonald-rafe-spall-arthur-ransome\">Swallows and Amazons</a> released yesterday, the Daily Telegraph pointed out that Arthur Ransome saw the children\u2019s novel as his last chance of popular success as an author \u2013 if it failed, the piece added, he feared it would leave him \u201clanguishing as a journalist on the Guardian\u201d.</p> <p>Although there is a kernel of truth in that account, the reality of his situation in 1930 was a little more complicated. He had been recruited by the Manchester Guardian\u2019s editor/proprietor CP Scott in 1919, and was a close friend of Scott\u2019s son and successor Ted (they had been contemporaries at Rugby). At 46, Ransome appears to have been an unusually pampered journalist, with ample spare time for writing books and sailing in the Lake District.</p> <p>Once he returned to Britain after covering the Russian revolution and its aftermath, his lenient Guardian workload consisted of occasional assignments as a foreign crisis \u201cfireman\u201d plus dashing off light Saturday columns, first on fishing and then miscellaneous musings. According to Roland Chambers\u2019s biography The Last Englishman, he had rejected the chance to be Berlin correspondent in the previous year and also resisted joining the leader-writing team.</p> <p>Yet Ransome had always seen his career as a mere fact gatherer as a detour, albeit a spectacular one in which he had witnessed the Bolsheviks\u2019 seizure of power at first hand and known Lenin and Trotsky (whose former secretary he married) personally. An author of children\u2019s fiction and literary biographies as a London bohemian before 1914, he became a foreign correspondent covering the wartime Eastern Front and Russia because he knew the country from earlier visits to collect folk tales. Returning to the Lake District in the 20s offered an opportunity to reclaim his true vocation as a spinner of yarns, if he could minimise and compartmentalise the distraction of his crust-earning newspaper duties.</p> <p>This was the complex background to Ransome becoming the first Guardian journalist to write enduringly popular fiction. He is certainly not the only journalist turned bestselling novelist, however. The Sunday Times boasts Ian Fleming and Jilly Cooper as alumni, and the Observer can match that with George Orwell and Robert Harris. Val McDermid worked on the People. Quitting the BBC was the making of Frederick Forsyth, as was quitting Granada Television (though not in a journalistic role) for Lee Child. Martin Amis and Julian Barnes were colleagues on the New Statesman. The Times, which had earlier seen its former subeditor Bill Bryson topping the sales charts, had Paula (<em>The Girl on the Train</em>) Hawkins on its roster as a finance journalist.</p> <p>The most convincing claim to be a home for hit-makers, though, is that of the Independent titles, despite their having a much shorter history than their rivals. Over just 30 years, Indy and Sindy writers have included Sebastian Faulks, Zoe Heller, Allison Pearson and Jojo Moyes, author of the bestselling <em>Me Before You</em>. And then, of course, there is Bridget Jones, who first appeared in Independent columns by Helen Fielding \u2013 a photo of a personal assistant on the paper was used on the distinctive jacket of <em>Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Taxpayers handed over \u00a39.3bn in housing benefit to Britain\u2019s private landlords last year, nearly double the amount paid 10 years ago, according to a new report. </p> <p>The number of households receiving housing benefit to pay rent to private landlords has risen 42% since 2008, the National Housing Federation, which represents the non-profit housing sector, has found.</p> <p>The NHF calculated that if all those housed in the private rented sector lived in affordable housing, taxpayers would save \u00a31.5bn a year. David Orr, the federation\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt is madness to spend \u00a39bn of taxpayers\u2019 money lining the pockets of private landlords, rather than investing in affordable homes.</p> <p>\u201cHousing associations want to build the homes the nation needs. By loosening restrictions on existing funding, the government can free up housing associations to build more affordable housing at better value to the taxpayer and directly address the housing crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The number of housing benefit recipients in the private rented sector has risen from just over a million in 2008 to almost 1.5 million in February this year.</p> <p>Housing benefit is paid to households that cannot afford to meet their rental costs and have enough left over for essentials such as food, clothes, heating and lighting. Almost half the households in the private rented sector that receive housing benefit are in work, but not earning enough to cover the rent and living expenses. </p> <p>In a sign of how pay has failed to keep pace with the cost of living, in 2008 only a quarter of the private renters in receipt of housing benefit were in work.</p> <p>According to the NHF\u2019s research, housing benefit claims in the private rented sector are much higher than in the non-profit housing sector, with on average about \u00a31,000 extra being spent to keep roofs over the heads of private renters \u2013 rising to \u00a33,300 a year in London. </p> <p>Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, the proportion of housing benefit recipients paying private rents has risen from one in four, to almost one in three.</p> <p>The NHF also noted a rise in the proportion of middle-income households forced to turn to the benefits system. \u201cSpecifically, the strongest increase in housing benefit claimants has been among households with net incomes between \u00a320,000 and \u00a328,000 per year, rising from 11% in 2008/09 to 19% in 2014/15,\u201d the report stated.</p> <p>A government spokesman said it had taken action to reduce the private rental sector housing benefit bill. \u201cThe reality is we have taken action to bring the housing benefit bill under control, and since 2012 the amount going to private sector landlords has actually been falling \u2013 something which the National Housing Federation fails to recognise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also committed to building the homes this country needs and investing \u00a38bn to build 400,000 more affordable homes.\u201d </p> <p>Teresa Pearce MP, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for housing and planning, said: \u201cThe government has made a number of attempts to reduce the housing benefit bill but they have been targeted at capping and penalising the claimants rather than spending on the root cause, which is a chronic lack of social housing. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe private rented sector has become the only option for the ever growing number of families with nowhere to call home, but it\u2019s expensive and insecure. This is not just a problem with the housing benefit system but with the whole of this government\u2019s housing policy which only wants to help those who can afford to buy.\u201d</p>",

On the way back to the Olympic Village, we pulled into a convenience store to use the restroom. There was no restroom inside, so we foolishly relieved ourselves on the backside of the building behind some bushes. There was a locked door out back and I did not witness anyone breaking it open. I am unsure why, but while we were in that area, Ryan pulled to the ground a framed metal advertisement that was loosely anchored to the brick wall. I then suggested to everyone that we needed to leave the area and we returned to the taxi.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/swimmer-reality-tv-star-diplomatic-incident-ryan-lochte\">Ryan Lochte: swimmer, reality TV star \u2013 and now diplomatic incident</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTwo men, whom I believe to have been security guards, then instructed us to exit the vehicle.

As Jimmy and Jack were walking away from the vehicle, the first security guard held up a badge to me and drew his handgun. I yelled to them to come back toward us and they complied. Then the second guard drew his weapon and both guards pointed their guns at us and yelled at us to sit on a nearby sidewalk.</p> <p>\u201cAgain, I cannot speak to his actions, but Ryan stood up and began to yell at the guards. After Jack and I both tugged at him in an attempt to get him to sit back down, Ryan and the security guards had a heated verbal exchange, but no physical contact was made.</p> <p>\u201cA man that I believe to be a customer approached us and offered to help as he spoke both English and Portuguese. Understandably, we were frightened and confused during this time. Through the interpreter, one of the guards said that we needed to pay them in order to leave. I gave them what I had in my wallet, which was a $20 bill, and Jimmy gave them 100 reals, which is about $50 in total. They lowered the guns and I used hand gestures to ask if it was OK to leave and they said yes. We walked about a block down the street and hailed another taxi to return to the Village.</p> <p>\u201cVideos of this situation have been emerging the last several days. However, I am confident that some video angles have not been shown that would further substantiate my account. I also believe some scenes have been skipped over. Additionally, I would like to stress that our original taxi was not pulled over; the only occupants of the taxi were the four of us and the driver; and to my knowledge, there was no damage done to the door or the inside of the restroom.</p> <p>\u201cI am so thankful for the love and support of my family, my friends and my teammates during this time.

But they are also free to build a life in Kampala \u2013 where 74,896 <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/refugees\">refugees</a> and asylum seekers were registered as of May 2016 \u2013 as Patrick,* who arrived from Rwanda in 2009 did. Today, he owns a shop and three motorcycle taxis, and employs workers on his land.</p> <p>Refugees in Uganda\u2019s rural settlements are allocated plots of land and given materials to build a basic home \u2013 so that investment in infrastructure benefits locals too; they also receive food aid and access to primary schools and health services. </p> <p>However, some other nationals in Uganda feel restricted by their refugee status. Although the authorities say people are free to come and go, Michael*, a Congolese artist who arrived in Nakivale settlement in 2010, says: \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t agree with you they can just stop you [from doing what you want].\u201d </p> <p>Sometimes the problem is unclear communication. Hakiza remembers brandishing a copy of the Refugee Act when he first went to register his organisation with the local authorities; they had had told him he wasn\u2019t allowed.</p> <p>Mimy Abeja, a Congolese single mother of 10, says Nakivale is \u201cnot a place to raise children\u201d. She is relieved not to be paying rent, but struggles to keep her tailoring business afloat, adding that all of the family have been in and out of hospital since they arrived. </p> <p>A<a href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/publications/humanitarian-assistance-and-politics-of-self-reliance-ugandas-nakivale-refugee-settleme\"> study from the Centre for International Governance Innovation</a> in 2015 found that, rather than being genuinely self-sufficient, most in Nakivale were \u201cengaged in daily survival tactics\u201d. Countrywide, <a href=\"http://www.refugee-rights.org/blog/?p=879\">most refugees live at subsistence level</a>, says David Kigozi, a senior programme officer at the Kampala-based <a href=\"http://www.refugee-rights.org/\">International Refugee Rights Initiative</a>, pointing out that over 70% depend on the <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/countries/uganda\">World Food Programme</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day we wake up fighting because of our stomachs,\u201d says 29-year-old Alex Bucunga, a filmmaker who arrived from DRC nine years ago, explaining that food rations are reduced significantly for those here longer than five years. Casual work helps fill the gaps: Bucunga has taught English, while others dig farmland, make bricks or work as translators. That\u2019s rarely sufficient to start or grow a business \u2014 but <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/partners/ngodirectory/4ea918e924/nsamizi-training-institute-social-development.html\">Nsamizi</a>, a training institute and responsible for livelihoods support in Nakivale, says a revolving credit fund for refugees will be operational later this year.</p> <p>The fund will likely also be open to Ugandans: government guidelines state that around 30% of refugee assistance should help host communities. Under a new UN strategy, acknowledging the longevity of displacement, livelihoods programmes will target refugees and Ugandans together, and some basic services will be merged. Water services in Nakivale will be handed to the district authority, eventually requiring refugees to pay for water just as locals do. Similarly, the UNHCR will hand over responsibility of the only secondary school in the area to the government. And there\u2019s even a suggestion of recruiting refugees into public service jobs, currently only open to Ugandans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e06c3f08eb66d09f0070a441ec16e3c9cc07c82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e06c3f08eb66d09f0070a441ec16e3c9cc07c82/0_4_4757_2853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees from Burundi have been given tree seedlings to plant in Rubondo village, in Nakivale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees from Burundi have been given tree seedlings to plant in Rubondo village, in Nakivale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Patton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, more refugees may travel to Uganda, especially if neighbouring Kenya keeps its <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/global-development/2016/may/25/kenya-william-ruto-tells-uk-to-resettle-somali-refugees-living-in-dadaab\">promise to close its camps</a>. Ugandans are \u201cquite tolerant\u201d for now, says Charity Ahumuza, a programme manager at the <a href=\"http://refugeelawproject.org/\">Refugee Law Project</a> at Makerere University, Kampala. \u201cBut people will think: \u2018If Kenya can say no, why should Uganda be generous?\u2019\u201d Her organisation is planning education activities this year to ensure public attitudes remain favourable.<br></p> <p>Attitudes in Europe, which wants to negotiate <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2016/jun/06/eu-sudan-eritrea-migration\">deals with some African countries</a> to prevent migration outside the continent, could also affect how refugees are treated in Uganda. As Ahumuza notes, pushback from Europe \u201cwill definitely have an impact on how communities who\u2019ve been hosting refugees will act\u201d.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/uganda\">Uganda</a> may now look to rich countries to take on more responsibility. But, while the size of plots given to refugees has already been halved, the government has not indicated that it will limit its open door policy, and a newly-opened settlement area with room for up to 100,000 people is already welcoming refugees. \u201cWhere else in the region would they go?\u201d asks Douglas Asiimwe, assistant commissioner for refugees. Many citizens \u2014 some of whom have been refugees themselves \u2014 share this view, providing some of the land allocated to newcomers.</p> <p>Even if the welcome continues, rising numbers of newcomers, severe funding shortages and further integration of assistance within national structures may encourage more realistic expectations among refugees. Jimmy Maguru, a project manager at Nsamizi, says Nakivale residents are taking more responsibility for their future than ever before \u2014 partly thanks to livelihoods projects, but also because \u201cpeople are hearing that plot sizes are likely to get smaller\u201d.</p> <p>Expectations of resettlement, though, may need to be addressed. Many hope for a future in North America or Europe \u2014 yet the UNHCR\u2019s resettlement target for Nakivale, home to more than 110,000 refugees, is only around 700 this year. </p> <p>\u201cPeople think the only one solution is resettlement [and that you\u2019re a] failure if you don\u2019t to go\u201d says Michael, who is planning new community projects in Nakivale. \u201cI want them to know they can start their life here.\u201d</p> <p><em>*Names have been changed</em></p> <p><em>The reporter\u2019s travel costs were covered by a <a href=\"http://www.oneworldmedia.org.uk/\">One World Media</a> grant</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>If there is one thing to learn about Croatian islands, it\u2019s that they are all different. Pag, for example, is all cheese and chalk, while Hvar is lavender and langoustines. But Cres is new to me and I want to know more about the joint-largest of the country\u2019s 718 islands (only 47 of which are inhabited). On the map it\u2019s a weird-looking, elongated creature, said by the ancient Greeks to be the body of Apsyrtus, murdered by Jason and his Argonauts. I\u2019m on a hiking trail across the northern head of the island, the Tramuntana, and I\u2019m on a Roman road. Not just the site of one, you understand, but the very cobbles laid down 2,000 years ago, although a local guide warned me that one short section was recently resurfaced \u2013 \u201cby Napoleon\u201d.</p> <p>The way leads past olive trees that look like they were planted to shade travellers when the road was first built. I cross a modern asphalt road and the trail becomes an old country path: white stones smoothed by centuries of bare feet and donkey hooves. It is hot, but I am shaded by immense oak trees. Then I emerge on a meadow of short grass and enter a village.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"573a382dcef58bed412b0c7ea80524875b5d9211\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/573a382dcef58bed412b0c7ea80524875b5d9211/0_346_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cres Town\u2019s seafront\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cres Town\u2019s seafront</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trees are laden with apples and sweet chestnuts ready to roast.

The only thing missing is people: they all abandoned this village, and many others on Cres, after the second world war. What this island has in abundance, I\u2019m realising, is ghosts.</p> <p>Later that day I reach Beli, a hilltop village on the coast, and the best base for exploring Tramuntana. My partner Sophie and daughter Maddy (13) are waiting for me, as arranged, in the <em>konoba</em>, or taverna. Maddy is at a point in her life when she likes 25 hours of sleep a day and can only be roused by the whispering of certain key words: snorkelling, rock climbing and Coke. Sophie, however, is at a point in her life where those words put her to sleep. For her, \u201cbeach and book\u201d usually hits the spot, though the addition of \u201cwhite wine\u201d always helps.

They never found peace in the city.\u201d</p> <p>The language they spoke, however, the Tramuntana dialect, will never come back: the last known speaker died in 2015.

Since there are only around 50 pairs left on Cres, they are a vital part of the rescue plan. They look a bit shabby and clumsy in their pen.

The coast near Beli is largely taken over by Italians.</p> <p>There are some simple country cafes, a kayak hire agency, a zipwire and a dive centre. But after picking our way through the sunning flesh, we find a gorgeous narrow path along the cliff where the wild sage grows. There is a second beach with about six people on it, then a third with two. Any further progress is blocked by a sign announcing that the next cliff is a griffon nesting site. We can\u2019t see any sign of them, however.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b6a57ebde44c30f2686e066fe48263e54815831\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b6a57ebde44c30f2686e066fe48263e54815831/0_70_5508_3305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie and Maddy canoe into a cove on Cres.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie and Maddy canoe into a cove on Cres.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maddy and I swim.

  "<p>Sheikha Naeema lifts her glass to take a sip of water, but the large grey telephone on her desk blinks again, red and insistent. It is only 9am and she has already spoken to 11 callers. The woman on the other end of the line is in distress.</p> <p>\u201cPeace be upon you, blessings be upon you,\u201d Sheikha Naeema says in a soothing tone. The woman tells her she has given birth twice and that both babies were stillborn. Now she is pregnant again. Her doctor has said the foetus is showing signs of severe complications and will probably die. The woman wants to know if Islam will permit her to have an abortion. After clarifying a few other details, Sheikha Naeema issues a fatwa. \u201cIf the foetus is severely ill and will not survive, you may have an abortion,\u201d she tells the woman. \u201cYou must take advice from your physician, he will guide you. Religion does not conflict with medicine.\u201d</p> <p>She explains that abortion is allowed under certain circumstances: within 120 days, or 17 weeks after conception if doctors believe the baby has life-threatening defects. The fatwa \u2013 a non-binding religious ruling \u2013 is justified on the basis of a hadith, a saying attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, which states that at 120 days a baby is given a soul, or spirit. When Sheikha Naeema finishes the call, she swivels in the office chair and makes a note. \u201cNormally it\u2019s quiet on Thursday mornings,\u201d she says.</p> <p>We are in the small, cramped office of <a href=\"http://www.awqaf.ae/Affair.aspx?Lang=EN&amp;SectionID=14&amp;RefID=868\">the fatwa hotline</a> on the eighth floor of the <a href=\"https://www.awqaf.gov.ae/?Lang=EN\">General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments</a> in Abu Dhabi, better known by its Arabic acronym, the Awqaf. Abu Dhabi\u2019s dial-a-fatwa hotline is run from a nondescript government building next to a supermarket along a busy stretch of road that leads to the pale turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf. Beyond the metal detector, polite receptionists direct visitors. A Bangladeshi employee in a pinstriped waistcoat pours coffee from a slender pot for visitors waiting in the lobby. A painting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/03/guardianobituaries.israel\">Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan</a>, the late president and founder of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/united-arab-emirates\">United Arab Emirates (UAE)</a>, hangs from a wall on the first-floor landing. He is kneeling in prayer and wearing oversized, aviator-style sunglasses. Awqaf hums with quiet bureaucracy and the whir of air conditioning as religious scholars in long white robes and keffiyehs wander in and out of glass-walled offices carrying papers and heavy books. A trace of rose incense mingles with the cold air.</p> <p>In the hotline\u2019s office, the air conditioning is cranked to sub-Arctic iciness. The room is small, the desks crammed together; soon, the scholars will move to a larger, purpose-built office a few kilometres away. For eight hours a day, five days a week, Sheikha Naeema and two female colleagues field queries from women, and sometimes men, from all sorts of backgrounds: rich and poor, young and old, devout and doubtful. They help them navigate elaborate moral and ethical rules and restrictions governing all areas of an observant Muslim\u2019s life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On the internet, not everything is correct... we teach people about the real Islam</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The iftaa, as the fatwa centre is called in Arabic, is the only one in the Middle East where a team of highly qualified women has been hired by the state to issue religious rulings. The women work across the hall from their male counterparts, 47 muftis who do the same job. The large white sign in the hall outside their office states the Awqaf\u2019s mission as \u201cpromoting social awareness and progress according to the tolerant teachings of Islam that recognise the current realities and understand the future challenges\u201d. The key word is \u201ctolerant\u201d.</p> <p>On this particular morning the queries range from, \u201cAre men and women allowed to work together in an office?\u201d (yes) to \u201cCan I fast during Ramadan if I have my period?\u201d (no). The sheikha\u2019s tone is matter of fact and professional. The next caller asks, \u201cIf I have noises coming from my vagina during prayer, does it nullify the prayer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is not flatulence, so no, your prayer is fine,\u201d Sheikha Naeema tells the caller delicately. \u201cThis problem is common to many women who have given birth.\u201d</p> <p>When she hangs up the phone, she tightens the black shayla scarf around her head, framing her direct gaze and wry expression. Her colleague, Sheikha Radia, hands her a cup of coffee.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no strange questions any more, we have heard everything,\u201d she says. The women smile and shrug.</p> <p>A highly respected legal scholar from Morocco, Sheikha Naeema, who is in her early 40s, has been working at the fatwa centre for eight years. On my first visit, her fingernails are dyed orange with henna and she wears the long black abaya gown commonly worn by women in the Gulf states.</p> <p>The women at the fatwa hotline are attempting to redress a gender imbalance in the religious sphere. Religious life in UAE, as in the rest of the Middle East, is dominated by men. Male imams preach sermons. Religious space is also a male domain: when the call to prayer sounds five times a day (sung by a man), it is men who hurry to the mosque. Women are encouraged to pray at home. And, inevitably, female scholars are rare.</p> <p>\u201cWe know it is unusual to hear a woman referred to as a muftiya, or sheikha, because this job is usually for men, but it is important women have someone they can turn to for help,\u201d Sheikha Radia says. \u201cWhen we communicate with another woman, we understand how she thinks.\u201d</p> <p>Sheikha Radia and Sheikha Naeema struggle to keep up with the volume of queries: up to 200 calls, text messages and emails every day, nearly always from women. The hotline has been such a success that six young Emirati women were sent to Morocco\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.um5.ac.ma/um5r/\">Mohammed V University</a> at Agdal on state-funded scholarships to become muftiyas. English-speaking muftiyas are also being recruited, but that is proving tricky. \u201cIf you know someone who may be qualified, please let us know,\u201d Sheikha Naeema says.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to teach people about the real Islam,\u201d says Mariam al Zaidi, 26, one of the graduates, adding that the state takes religious education for women seriously. \u201cWe all had full scholarships, we didn\u2019t pay for anything. We had a car to take us to classes if we needed it, and accommodations were built. We were also given spending money.\u201d</p> <p>She says the government is simply reviving an ancient tradition. \u201cAll the women in the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s life were teaching people, not just women but men, too, and explaining the faith.\u201d</p> <p>The hotline addresses the intimate preoccupations of Muslim women, unmediated by male professionals or clerics, and emboldened by the promise of anonymity. But the female scholars\u2019 work is also part of a long-term government strategy to bring moderate, female scholarship to Islamic discourse at a time when religious fanaticism and sectarianism is on the rise across the Middle East. Jihadist groups such as Islamic State and the Taliban view the removal of women from public life as a critical component of a state ruled by their interpretation of sharia law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ed1e2ad09c67e1cd653258b75003447cbd36afa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ed1e2ad09c67e1cd653258b75003447cbd36afa/5_137_5147_3088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mariam Al Zaidi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mariam al Zaidi, one of the first Emirati women to train as part of a UAE state-funded programme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parisa Azadi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/14/looking-at-salman-rushdies-satanic-verses\">The Satanic Verses</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/salmanrushdie\">Salman Rushdie</a> was burned across the Muslim world in 1989 and its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-translator.html\">Japanese translator murdered</a> in Tokyo, the term \u201cfatwa\u201d became associated in some parts of the west with summary death sentences. In fact, a fatwa is a legal opinion that helps an observant Muslim lead an ethical life; there is no obligation to follow it.</p> <p>Abu Dhabi\u2019s fatwa centre is not part of the country\u2019s legal system, which is based on principles of the moderate Maliki school of Sunni jurisprudence with elements of various European legal codes. There are sharia courts and civil courts that run in parallel and cover different parts of the law. In some cases a mufti or muftiya might be consulted, but only a judge can make a legally binding ruling. Islam grades all human behaviour into five categories: obligatory, prohibited, recommended, discouraged or neutral. The women scholars advise the faithful on where their actions fall on this spectrum. A fatwa is not legally enforceable, and if you don\u2019t like the ruling of one mufti, you can go somewhere else for a different judgment.</p> <p>A fatwa is not merely an opinion, however. It must be based on the verses of the Qur\u2019an or the hadith, or the opinions of previous generations of Muslim scholars across 1,400 years of history, or, in the rare cases when those sources do not provide an answer, well-argued logic, to come up with a completely new ruling. These complexities tend to be missing from many self-styled Islamic experts, whose opinions are just a quick Google search away. You can find fatwas giving permission to behead captives or, in the case of Isis, take women as sex slaves. This free-for-all is why the Emiratis have taken steps to direct people towards approved scholars.</p> <p>\u201cOn the internet, not everything is correct,\u201d Zaidi says. \u201cYou ask a simple question and get many opinions. I believe it is better to go to a specialist if you have a problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost questions from Muslims will have to do with their relationship with the divine and their ability to fulfil that for which they will be rewarded not in this world but in the world to come,\u201d says <a href=\"http://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/faculty/justin-stearns.html\">Justin Stearns</a>, an American associate professor and head of the Arab Crossroads Studies programme at New York University Abu Dhabi. I meet Stearns in a cafe in the sprawling pale stone campus surrounded by miles of sand on <a href=\"http://visitabudhabi.ae/en/explore/islands/saadiyat.island.aspx\">Saadiyat Island</a> on the north side of Abu Dhabi. He has a short, greying beard and peppers his speech with fluent Arabic as he types on a silver MacBook. \u201cIn the marketplace of religious opinion, if you are just an average Muslim out there, you\u2019d look to someone who can separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to religious authority,\u201d he says. \u201cHere you have the state doing that.\u201d</p> <p>The Awqaf is effectively the final authority on all matters related to Islam; every religious text is scrutinised for radicalism, every imam vetted. Many countries have an official mufti or fatwa centre but none has stated in clear terms that no one else in the country is allowed to issue these rulings. A committee of religious scholars decides the content of the Friday sermons to be preached in every mosque by the imams who are all on the state payroll and forbidden to deviate from the official topic which adheres to moderate values: respect for religious minorities including Christians and for women. One sermon I attend is about a daughter\u2019s right to choose her own husband, although sometimes the topics concern more mundane matters such as obeying traffic laws.</p> <p>Such a degree of control over matters of faith is highly unusual in the Muslim world. \u201cWhat we found over the last 30 years was that there were a number of non-local imams with longstanding political grievances against their own countries who were giving sermons,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.alhabibali.com/en/biography/\">Habib Ali al-Jifri</a>, chairman and founder of the <a href=\"http://www.tabahfoundation.org/en/\">Tabah Foundation</a>, a state-funded faith organisation in Abu Dhabi. \u201cWe had the same problem with fatwas,\u201d he says, when we meet in the foundation\u2019s library. \u201cThey were contradictory, informal and people could get rulings anywhere. To bring control and balance we began streamlining the process. And bringing in the women muftis was a part of that process.\u201d</p> <p>Jifri knows first-hand how modern communications can spread hate. He has 3.5 million <a href=\"https://twitter.com/habibalienglish\">Twitter followers</a>, and he found out on Twitter that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/02/syria-debate-the-linguistic-battle-over-what-to-call-islamic-state\">Isis (or Daesh</a>, as Arabs call the extremist group) had issued a fatwa sentencing him to death. \u201cThis is the reality we live in,\u201d he says with a shrug as a member of staff appears with a tray of pomegranate juice. \u201cPlease take one, it\u2019s organic. As I was saying, Daesh and its like try to create a barrier to prevent people from engaging with scholars. If people engaged with scholars with real knowledge, like us, then they would see the illegitimacy of the likes of Daesh.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://mmgsurvey.tabahfoundation.org/\">a survey</a> carried out by the Tabah Foundation and Zogby Research Services, a Washington, DC-based polling firm, released earlier this year, 5,374 Arab Muslims aged 15-34 in eight countries were asked to what extent groups such as Isis were a perversion of Islamic teaching. Of UAE respondents, 92% said they were a \u201ccomplete\u201d perversion. Only 45% of Kuwaitis believed the same.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The United Arab Emirates lies on the south-eastern side of the Persian Gulf, wedged between the region\u2019s two powerful rivals: Iran across the narrow stretch of water to the north and Saudi Arabia to the south. Half a century ago, UAE was poor. Society was homogenous, tribal and close-knit, necessary if people were to survive a climate in which arable land and drinking water are scarce and temperatures often reach 50C. Society and values were structured around the Islamic faith and patriarchal tribal customs. Women were mostly kept out of the public eye.</p> <p>The discovery of oil in the late 1950s changed the country radically. UAE sits on <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/countries-with-biggest-crude-oil-reserves-2015-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\">the seventh largest proven oil reserves in the world</a>, and the financial surpluses of oil wealth have been channelled to transform a society once reliant on trading and fishing into a state with an economy focused around finance, real estate and tourism. The purpose is to create a society that can function when the oil and gas run out. Modernity does not necessarily mean democracy, yet the hereditary rulers encourage Emirati women to participate in public life \u2013 in February, <a href=\"http://www.uaecabinet.ae/en/details/news/sheikh-khalifa-approves-the-new-12th-cabinet-of-the-united-arab-emirates\">five women were appointed to the cabinet</a>, which has an advisory role. Inevitably, perhaps, there are tensions between modern life and traditional Islamic values. Many Muslim women in Abu Dhabi, both Emirati and expatriate, privately express their anxieties. Are they betraying Islamic values by working with men outside the home, for example? Is it permissible to delay motherhood? Is it OK to eat a meal in a restaurant that serves alcohol? The Abu Dhabi muftiyas, by taking into account how women live now, try to bridge the old values and the new.</p> <p>Despite efforts to move the economy away from dependency on oil, the majority of the government\u2019s revenues come from the hydrocarbon sector. The Emirates needs foreign investment and foreign workers to build a post-oil economy. It can ill afford Islamist violence of the kind that has wrecked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/18/tunisia-beach-holidays-sousse-terrorist-attack\">Tunisia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/mediterranean-resorts-fall-in-tourism-numbers-due-to-isis-attacks\">Egypt\u2019s tourism</a>-dependent economies. The expatriate, transient population, mostly Muslims from South Asia and the Middle East, are rootless and far from home towns where the mosque and faith leaders are the bedrock of their communities. The Awqaf has 14 telephone lines and between them the muftis and muftiyas answer 1,000 queries every day, rising to 3,000 during Ramadan, from both men and women. Services are provided in English, Arabic and Urdu, reflecting the most common languages spoken in the country. The scholars issue fatwas in accordance to all four schools of Sunni Islam. The ease of access is to encourage residents to turn to a local mufti instead of a firebrand with a YouTube channel.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the ways in which the Emirati state assures its own authority is it protects Islam,\u201d Stearns says. \u201cIt advances religion, it guarantees you have a mosque in every city block and it provides easy access to religious expertise for its citizens. It sees this as a duty of the state and a service for citizens.\u201d</p> <p>The Emirates has largely escaped the upheavals of the Arab spring; the six royal families that make up the federation have maintained their grip on power. It is a relatively open society, particularly compared with other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia. Emirati women can drive, go to school, work outside the home. Covering their hair is not required by law, although the vast majority of Emirati women do so.</p> <p>There have been no terrorist attacks in UAE. The one exception was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/uae-woman-executed-over-killing-of-american-teacher-in-abu-dhabi\">the strange case of Ala\u2019a al-Hashemi</a>. On 1 December 2014, Hashemi, 30, an Emirati mother of six children, stabbed to death an American teacher in the bathroom cubicle of a luxury shopping centre in Abu Dhabi. The court was told she had been radicalised online by al-Qaida literature. She was convicted and in July 2015 was executed by a firing squad.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When we communicate with another woman, we understand how she thinks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The mutifyas may not have political or legal power but they exert a powerful, subtle influence on society by shaping values, not only in their work at the fatwa centre but also in mosques in the capital, where they lecture and hold all-female study circles.</p> <p>One evening I attend a lecture at the Shaikh Hamdan mosque on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi. The speaker, Edithal al-Shamsi, is a 57-year-old retired Emirati schoolteacher and also a hafiz \u2013 an honorific conferred on the few Muslims who have memorised the Qur\u2019an. The mosque\u2019s slender minarets are lit by green spotlights and glow against the inky black desert sky. Outside, young girls board a bus that will take them home after Qur\u2019an lessons. As in all mosques, the women\u2019s section is at the back. I walk up a narrow, green marble spiral staircase and the scent of sandalwood drifts from the prayer hall. I can hear Shamsi before I see her.</p> <p>\u201cOnly in some matters may a man look at a woman,\u201d she is saying, peering at the crowd through owlish glasses. \u201cIf they are colleagues at work, for example, or if he is in court, or if he will propose. Otherwise he must avert his eyes and be respectful. Do not leer. For women, I advise don\u2019t go out with so much makeup, short skirts and tight clothes.\u201d</p> <p>The point is subtle: women have to be modest but men, too, bear responsibility for their behaviour. The 30 women sitting in a semicircle around Shamsi on the lush carpet tut in agreement. A few are in their 20s but most are older. Some wear the burga, the green-gold face mask worn by Bedouin women.</p> <p>Afterwards the women kiss Shamsi affectionately and offer plates of samosas. She does not issue fatwas but her status of hafiz gives her licence to talk about subjects normally taboo in Arab society. She warns that men should not watch pornography because it \u201cmakes them lose brain cells\u201d and anal sex is a sin. We settle in a corner of the elegantly furnished room where verses of the Qur\u2019an are carved in gold-coloured relief along the walls. I ask if she isn\u2019t embarrassed to bring up sensitive subjects.</p> <p>\u201cThe women like it because these topics are important,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a place for women to come and discuss openly and safely.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes she chooses the topic; other times Awqaf scholars decide. At the end of the evening, her notes, giving a broad overview of it (omitting intimate details that might identify women), will be submitted to the Awqaf authorities, who are looking out not for issues of private moral choices but possible support for radical Islam. Since the Arab spring, everyone is under close scrutiny. In the lectures I attend with the women scholars, no one discusses politics. But that evening, when I finish talking to Shamsi, a tall, heavy-set Emirati woman approaches, looking agitated.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are women and children being killed in Syria? If I pray and kill, I will still go to hell. Praying will not help,\u201d she shouts, gesticulating wildly. \u201cAs a Muslim, I am not allowed to even steal a pen,\u201d she says, snatching my pen from my hand. The room falls into a hush. To break the tension, one of the women passes around Sytrofoam cups of sahlab, a milky hot drink.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c7e59fcbff5d652eb2bb30634852222ada9d9b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c7e59fcbff5d652eb2bb30634852222ada9d9b5/19_230_4566_2740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women at the fatwa hotline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muftiyas at the fatwa hotline answer up to 200 calls, texts and emails every day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Delores Johnson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hotline opened in 2007 and the following year a team of scholars travelled to Morocco to recruit female experts \u2013 Morocco also practises the Maliki school of Islam, and the Emirates at the time lacked qualified Emirati women. Women\u2019s access to education has been very recent \u2013 Shamsi is unusual among her generation in having a university degree. In 1980 only 2.7% of women went to college or university but today Emirati women outnumber men in post-secondary education, making up more than 70% of the student body at the public universities. Morocco, however, has had a longer track record of women in post-secondary education. Sheikha Radia and Sheikha Naeema were recent graduates when they were approached. \u201cWe were asked a lot of questions during the interviews,\u201d Sheikha Radia says. \u201cThey wanted to make sure we were knowledgable and moderate.\u201d</p> <p>Sheikha Radia earned a doctorate in Islamic sciences from Mohammed V University and specialises in jurisprudence. Her thesis was on Islam\u2019s response to Christianity\u2019s belief that Jesus is the Son of God. She has hundreds of hadiths at her fingertips and can readily explain their meaning and historical context. Sheikha Naeema has a doctorate from <a href=\"http://www.univh2m.ac.ma/\">Hassan II University in Casablanca</a> and is a hafiz. The daughter of a furniture-maker from Casablanca, she grew up in a religious household and it came as no surprise that faith was her professional calling.</p> <p>The muftiyas may be unusual in the modern Muslim world but that wasn\u2019t the case throughout Islamic history. During the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s lifetime, about 130 women issued religious rulings. The most prominent was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/sep/17/muhammad-aisha-truth\">Aisha</a>, his third wife. The names of approximately 10,000 women scholars, little known to history, were catalogued by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ShaykhMohammadAkramNadwi/home\">Mohammad Akram Nadwi</a>, a renowned Islamic scholar and researcher who lives in Oxford. \u201cWe grow up in Muslim societies where women are basically discouraged from anything and there are mosques in the UK that don\u2019t allow women inside,\u201d Nadwi says, speaking on the phone from his home. \u201cBut in the past they were learning, teaching in mosques, and it was normal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When a woman confides that her husband is having an affair, she is advised to urge him to have two wives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The muftiyas do not fit any neat categories of liberal or conservative interpretations of the Qur\u2019an. Sometimes the fatwas issued in Abu Dhabi sit uneasily with the laws of the country. An expatriate man recently contacted the hotline. He explained that his wife had a job but was not contributing to the household expenses. He was considering cancelling his wife\u2019s residency visa, which gave her the right to work in the Emirates, and sending her home. Under the law it was legal but he wanted to know if it was a sin. Yes, it would be a sin, came the ruling. \u201cThe husband is not entitled to her salary or even a portion of it without her full consent,\u201d the fatwa stated.</p> <p>Not that the views of the women scholars would meet a western, secular definition of feminism. Sheikha Naeema explains that when women confide that their husbands are having extramarital affairs, she advises them to urge the husband to marry his mistress and take on a second wife, rather than fall into the sin of adultery.</p> <p>One morning Sheikha Radia is on duty when an Arab woman rings the hotline. Her husband is in love with another woman. She is heartbroken; what should she do?</p> <p>\u201cYou must continue your life,\u201d Sheikha Radia urges her. \u201cDon\u2019t keep your husband at the centre of your life. Do you have children?\u201d She pauses. \u201cOK, focus on your children. Think of your husband as a visitor in the home. He can come and go, eat and sleep.\u201d</p> <p>When she hangs up, Sheikha Radia sighs. \u201cIt is unfortunate that a woman has fallen in love with a married man, this woman\u2019s husband.\u201d You can\u2019t advise her to divorce, I ask. No, she says, divorce is a sin to be avoided. But what if her husband were beating her? Islam forbids domestic violence, she says. \u201cIf a woman tells me this, I try to find out if they are abusive towards each other. Can there be a reconciliation? If not I tell her she must call the police and social services.\u201d</p> <p>She admits it is easier to give this advice than heed it because many abused women, especially those with children, are financially dependent on their husbands. \u201cThe best protection is for a woman to have financial independence,\u201d she concludes.</p> <p>***</p> <p>As the Emirates continues its pursuit of a western-style, Islamic modernity, the role of women is changing. More women, whether they are Emirati or Arab and Asian expatriate residents, are sharing the financial burden with their husbands and working outside the home. They come into contact with new ideas and cultures, and some are starting to interrogate the ideas they accepted while they were growing up. A few women are even questioning the necessity of wearing the hijab.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4906bc5f9cd7c4cd2abc7f20b7adb6933b1329cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4906bc5f9cd7c4cd2abc7f20b7adb6933b1329cf/135_284_4744_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheikha Radia talks to women at an all-female study circle in a mosque in Abu Dhabi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheikha Radia talks to women at an all-female study circle in a mosque in Abu Dhabi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parisa Azadi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sheikha Naeema is about to give a lecture at a newly refurbished mosque. The white stone building is located in a wealthy neighbourhood where villas are surrounded by high walls over which tumbles white frangipani, its luscious scent hanging in the air. Sheikha Naeema is sitting sipping the local cardamom-scented coffee as she makes notes. Most of her audience are in their 30s and 40s, a few much older. Many are Emirati, some Palestinian, Syrian and Moroccan.</p> <p>After giving an hour-long lecture explaining why it is a sin to spread rumours about other people, she is approached by a young Palestinian woman in an orange hijab.</p> <p>\u201cCan I ask you about the hijab? Is it mandatory?\u201d she asks hesitantly. Her question is startling. Few Muslim women in the region leave their hair uncovered, and fewer still question its necessity.</p> <p>\u201cIt is mandatory, it is in <a href=\"http://quran.com/24\">Surah an-Nur</a>,\u201d Sheikh Naeema tells her gently, referring her to a specific chapter and verse of the Qur\u2019an.</p> <p>But the young woman is not satisfied. She explains that she has worn a hijab since she was a teenager but is now reconsidering. She is 30 and unmarried, and worries that perhaps she is seen as old-fashioned. Her sister, who wears a hijab, advised her it would be a sin to remove it. Her mother also wears a hijab but is ambivalent, having grown up in the more secular 1970s when few Arab women covered their hair.</p> <p>What about the niqab, the young woman asks Sheikha Naeema, referring to the face-covering that leaves only the eyes exposed.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a cultural option for some women in the Gulf countries, but you don\u2019t need to wear it,\u201d the scholar answers firmly.</p> <p>The young Palestinian thanks her politely. Afterwards, she says Sheikha Naeema\u2019s reputation in the community settled the question. \u201cShe has the knowledge, so I will listen. But I would prefer it if I didn\u2019t wear it. I like to show my hair.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For an ingenious new spin on the celebrity interview, <strong>Unforgettable </strong><em>(Weekdays, 1.45pm, Radio 4)</em> brings together people closely acquainted with distinguished deceased people and the archive of interviews those people recorded during their lifetime. It begins with David Temple, who was married to the sister of Derek Jarman, comparing his recollections of the brother-in-law he knew with the version of himself that the film-maker/gardener projected in interviews.</p> <p>The interviewer is encouraged to put questions to which they always wanted answers, listen to the answer that the archive provides, and then react to the responses. The editing is smart enough from time to time to have them apparently conversing and laughing at each other\u2019s jokes. The resulting programme has some of the candour and hilarity that accompanies conversations that take place while clearing up after a wake. Further editions feature a nephew of Malcolm X, a former business partner of Douglas Adams and the film-maker Tony Garnett conversing with the copious archive of his late adversary Mary Whitehouse.</p> <p>In <strong>Hersey\u2019s Hiroshima</strong> <em>(Monday, 11pm, Radio 4)</em> Peter Curran recounts the story of a unique piece of journalism, John Hersey\u2019s 30,000-word account of what happened when the first atomic bomb was dropped on 6 August 1945, compiled from interviews with survivors. The first plan was to run it in four parts, until New Yorker editor William Shawn decided it would have more impact if published as a single story. It was a state secret within the magazine, with the copy being fed to the printers a sheet at a time and as other writers carried on meeting deadlines, not realising they were taking part in a fiction. The resulting piece reverberated across the United States and beyond. An abridged version of that script is read in <strong>Hiroshima</strong> <em>(Tuesday, 6.30pm, Radio 4 Extra)</em>.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do children lie?\u201d asks psychotherapist Philippa Perry in <strong>The Truth About Children Who Lie</strong> <em>(Tuesday, 4pm, Radio 4)</em>.

  "<p>Christopher Wood has a good claim to being the most interesting English artist of the 1920s, yet he remains rather obscure. When a very young man he wrote from Paris that he had \u201cdecided to try and be the greatest painter that has ever lived\u201d, and his unwavering ambition and drive are among the most striking aspects of his short life. Handsome, talented and charismatic, he attracted friends and devotees wherever he went; Diaghilev was drawn to him and Picasso saw his appeal. He was bisexual, and among his lovers were a Guinness heiress and one of Jean Cocteau\u2019s \u201cenfants terribles\u201d.</p> <p>So when he jumped in front of a train aged 29 in 1930, it was almost inevitable that he would become a kind of tragic cult hero. The cover of Sebastian Faulks\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/fatal-englishman.html\"><em>The Fatal Englishman</em></a> features a painting of the fallen Icarus, and \u201cKit\u201d Wood, subject of the first of the three studies in that entertaining book, was instantly romanticised as someone who lived too intensely, burned too brightly and flew too high, a beautiful and innocent \u201cvictim of a cruel world\u201d. The dark contours of a cultural stereotype \u2013 the doomed youth, the curtailment of great promise \u2013 have always risked eclipsing the art that he produced.</p> <p>His death was both the making of his legacy, in terms of sudden fame, and the undoing of it, in terms of long-standing artistic reputation. His suicide, and his glamorous life as an English artist within the Parisian <em>beau monde,</em> have offered a better story than the paintings.

Photograph: Michael and Ruth West</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael and Ruth West</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also hasn\u2019t helped his cause that English painting in the 1920s has long been considered a backwater \u2013 a quiet decade (even by the standards of British art in the first half of the 20th century), following as it did the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/05/vorticism-wyndham-lewis-exhibition-june-1915-100-years-ago\"> vorticist</a> spasm of the 1910s, and preceding the discovery of abstraction. Wood was always a figurative painter, which put him at a remove from the main modernist trajectory (though the influence of post-impressionism and modernism on him was profound). He was a vivid character, not on the scene for long, who belonged to an artistic subplot that went nowhere.</p> <p>But now his pictures, which have always been celebrated by a few, are being more closely considered. In <em>Christopher Wood</em>, Katy Norris doesn\u2019t aspire to the storytelling esprit of Faulks, nor has she set out to write a biography (Richard Ingleby wrote a good one, which draws on Wood\u2019s many letters, in 1995). Published alongside an 80\u2011work exhibition at <a href=\"http://www.pallant.org.uk/\">Pallant House Gallery</a> in Chichester, her book is instead a careful and very welcome discussion of the different elements of his paintings. As she points out, art-historical criticism has moved away from the idea of a linear progression of movements, and these days has more time for outliers such as Wood. She details not only his magpie tendency (he borrowed freely from C\u00e9zanne, Picasso, Van Gogh, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/nov/06/art\">Henri Rousseau</a> and the fauvists), but also the development of his highly individual naive style, an expression of what Faulks calls \u201cmodernism in an English idiom, the exhilaration of something bright and joyful achieved in a mysterious and oddly menacing way\u201d.</p> <p>Central to Wood\u2019s discovery of this style was the influence of the Cornish fisherman and untrained artist Alfred Wallis. One of the most familiar episodes in Wood\u2019s life is the walk he took with Ben Nicholson in the streets of St Ives in August 1928 when, through an open door, they spotted pictures, as Norris describes, of \u201cdramatic sea voyages painted on an assortment of odd-shaped supports made from salvaged pieces of driftwood and cardboard torn from grocery boxes\u201d.</p> <p>There was perhaps an element of condescension and slumming in Wood\u2019s initial taking up of Wallis \u2013 as Faulks says, the fisherman \u201cwas the kind of picturesque original who might appeal to someone who had been to too many of the Comte de Beaumont\u2019s fancy dress balls\u201d. Yet there was also genuine artistic excitement, and Wood, who visited Wallis every day in the final months of that year, was honest about his large debt to him. Besides, the directness of form and colour in Wallis\u2019s work was aligned to some degree with Wood\u2019s earlier enthusiasm for the primitivism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gauguin\">Gauguin</a> and others: it was a quality he had long sought in his urgent quest to find a trademark style.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31373af56dcb7af0877356108a6cf6a66689fa0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31373af56dcb7af0877356108a6cf6a66689fa0d/0_0_3600_2986/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Wood, La Plage, Hotel Ty-Mad, Tr\u00e9boul in France, 1930.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"829\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Wood, La Plage, Hotel Ty-Mad, Tr\u00e9boul in France, 1930.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Museums Sheffield</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although there are many canvases from 1920-27 that attest to Wood\u2019s prowess \u2013 not least his self-portrait wearing a harlequin pattern sweater, and the portrait of the composer Constant Lambert, as well as some landscapes and still lifes \u2013 most of his best work followed his inspiration by Wallis. Especially notable are the pictures painted in 1929 both in Dieppe and the traditional fishing village of Tr\u00e9boul in Brittany. Suddenly his power was unlocked, as the naive vision provided by the fisherman artist overlaid what he had learned from the modern masters. He finally had something truly original.</p> <p>Faulks describes a typical Wood picture: \u201cthe sea, darkly dressed fisherpeople, drama, strangeness, something primitive; the homely human figures set against a background of wildness and mystery, expressed in misleadingly simple terms\u201d. The strangeness is vital. Its unsettling quality is what makes the oil-on-board painting <em>Building the Boat</em>, <em>Tr\u00e9boul</em> so powerful, with the curved wooden ribs suggesting an animal skeleton, and in the foreground, in Norris\u2019s words, \u201cthe wraithlike figure of an elderly woman whose presence permeates the scene with a nostalgic and melancholic atmosphere\u201d. She is black-clad, in traditional Breton costume, and hugging a plank, as if were a baby.</p> <p>The slightly hallucinogenic quality of Wood\u2019s best late work owed much to his opium habit. He was first introduced to the drug within months of arriving in Paris by Tony Gandarillas, a rich Chilean diplomat and dedicated hedonist, who was Wood\u2019s companion. But the effects of the drug were stronger, more dangerous, when the painter was alone and his supply ran low, because then he began to smoke the dross from his pipes. He knew the risks, but during those final years of the decade, Wood was, according to Faulks, \u201creckless, impatient and addicted\u201d, and also \u201cin the midst of a creative storm\u201d. The artist wrote to the gallery owner Lucy Wertheim that opium was \u201cthe only resource of quietness which takes my mind \u2026 out of that awful turmoil of ideas and colours that go on in my busy head\u201d. His misuse of the drugwas his downfall \u2013 he began to get paranoid thoughts and believed he was being followed. But it also probably helped him attain his moments of greatness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d2c407551bf1554b5d60d3afbdaea070dd966ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d2c407551bf1554b5d60d3afbdaea070dd966ac/0_0_3414_4746/719.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Wood, Self-portrait, 1927.\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Wood, Self-Portrait, 1927.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kettle\u2019s Yard, University of Cambridge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another radiant, mystical painting from the Tr\u00e9boul months is <em>Sleeping Fisherman</em>, <em>Ploar\u00e9, Brittany</em>, which depicts a recumbent Adonis on the beach with a basket of mackerel. Norris finds in it a \u201crecurrence of homoerotic imagery derived from Cocteau and Diaghilev\u201d. Wood\u2019s bisexuality was long ago judged \u201cconvenient\u201d by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/30/news.obituaries\">Anthony Powell</a>, with reference to the relationships the aspiring painter struck up with the men who first introduced him to the Parisian art scene. The idea of convenience has stuck, but it seems unfair: his sexuality is surely better just described as not hidebound. Norris rightly says that the homoeroticism that re-emerges in some later paintings \u2013 made during a time when his affairs were with women, and he was deeply involved with the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9e Frosca Munster \u2013 should offer a reminder that \u201chis artistic vision remained emphatically open-ended and unresolved\u201d.</p> <p>Wood\u2019s sexuality has been cited as one of the reasons he was so psychologically troubled that he took his own life \u2013 others include the gradual onset of serious financial problems. Yet this kind of approach reintroduces the problem of reading both his life and art backwards from his early death. Many of Wood\u2019s friends suggested that his fate was somehow predestined. Winifred Nicholson, who was so devastated by the news of his suicide that she employed a private detective to try to prove another cause of death, soon found seeds of self-destruction everywhere, and wrote of the Tr\u00e9boul work that the \u201ccost of such painting is heavy\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that Wood pushed himself to a creative limit in 1929 and 1930, so that he became indifferent to his health. But there was nothing at all inevitable about his fate. Indeed the clearest fresh light on the paintings might be shed by imagining that he <em>hadn\u2019t</em> died young. As Norris writes, the final pair of Wood\u2019s significant paintings point in a new artistic direction, towards surrealism (<em>Zebra and Parachute</em>; <em>Tiger and the Arc de Triomphe</em>). Who knows what might have followed? Had he really come to an endpoint \u2013 as far as he could go? What always mattered to him, above all, was continuing to make art: his impossible dream of being \u201cthe greatest painter who has ever lived\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Christopher Wood: Sophisticated Primitive</em> is at Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, until 2 October.

  "<h2><strong>Bev Grant, 48, and Maria Amidu, 49: friends for 33 years</strong></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Bev </strong>I was 15, Maria was 16 and we were about to leave school when I met her in Wigan at a party. There were all these people in a garden singing happy-clappy songs, and I was on a bench in one corner and I looked across. Maria was sitting on the other side and we glanced at each other and that was it \u2013 we started laughing. We just hit it off.</p> <p>I lived in a pub, so that was handy, and we went to the same college. We saw each other all the time even though I left and she stayed on. She was the good girl; I was the rebel. Then she started going out with my brother, and I met Colin. He had a little red Chevette car, and we would all go on days out. When I married Colin in 1988, Maria was my bridesmaid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think we\u2019re a real mix \u2013 worlds apart but very similar as well. We\u2019ve always understood each other</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I think we\u2019re a real mix \u2013 worlds apart but very similar as well. We\u2019ve always understood each other. My sons are like family to Maria; she\u2019s known Colin almost as long as she\u2019s known me, and my mum calls her \u201cmy other daughter\u201d. I call her \u201cmy sister from another mister\u201d because I\u2019ve never had a sister and Maria is like one to me.</p> <p>We message each other every single day \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/03/from-political-coups-to-family-feuds-how-whatsapp-became-our-favourite-way-to-chat\">WhatsApp</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/skype\">Skype</a> when she\u2019s abroad and she\u2019ll give me a tour of where she is. At this ripe old age, I\u2019ve still never been abroad, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Ives,_Cornwall\">St Ives</a> in Cornwall is special to us and whenever we go somewhere there\u2019s always a funny little drama.</p> <p>It would be nice if she lived closer, if when we had fed-up days we could call in and put the kettle on and sit and have a moan or weep or rant instead of relying on WhatsApp. I do have other best friends but ours feels like an unbreakable bond. People talk about finding their soulmates and they always imagine a couple, but I think soulmates can be friends. She\u2019s the first person I turn to, before anyone else. We did an all-nighter on the phone once \u2013 she rang me at one in the morning and we were still talking at 7.30am.</p> <p><br><strong>Maria </strong>Between the ages of 16 and 19 we saw each other nearly every day. Her brother Paul was my first serious boyfriend. I had been in Wigan since I was 13 when I was fostered and moved there with my sister from Sussex. Our friendship was the only good thing that came out of me being up there.</p> <p>It was quite weird at first: I couldn\u2019t understand anything anybody said, so I spent the whole time saying pardon, and everybody thought I talked like the Queen. I had a big afro, I was one of the tallest kids and the only black person in the whole school.</p> <p>When things started breaking down with my foster family, I went to Bev\u2019s. Her mum and dad were brilliant. Then my social worker got involved and I got my own flat. To be honest, I don\u2019t know how I would have managed if I hadn\u2019t met Bev.</p> <p>We live more than 200 miles apart now, but I visit her when I can and the telephone has been crucial in our friendship. The key thing is we have the same sense of humour. Her kids are hilarious; it\u2019s like a humour gene runs in the family and that\u2019s been a massive connection for us. It doesn\u2019t matter how grim the situation is, we will make each other laugh. We might have different views, but we have the same love of language. For both of us, who you love and care about is the most important thing in life. Even though we\u2019ve got very different lives now, we\u2019ve got the same principles. It\u2019s rare to feel validated without having to explain yourself. It\u2019s difficult to explain, but it\u2019s an understanding and when we get together we just slot in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92a5ada98b0dee35d5d64494318d48f0c98269a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92a5ada98b0dee35d5d64494318d48f0c98269a1/0_1826_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammed (left) and Aslam have been friends since 1958.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohammed (left) and Aslam have been friends since 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Butler/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Mohammed Irshad, 81, and Aslam Lone, 78: friends for 58 years</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mohammed </strong>The first time we watched a test match together at Trent Bridge was in 1966, when the Pakistan team was on tour and the Pakistan Friends League arranged a dinner for the players. Pakistan came again this summer and we both followed the series, which was fantastic. We talk a lot about cricket wherever it is happening; it\u2019s always exciting, even when our team is losing.</p> <p>We met in 1958 at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirpur,_Azad_Kashmir\">Mirpur</a> college in Kashmir, where he was a student and I was director of physical education. My younger brother was in his class and we used to get together for meals and to entertain other cricket teams. I was an all-rounder while he was more on the intellectual side, writing and debating, but he was always with us and everybody liked him. He is a sincere person and very witty; he makes everybody laugh and is never boring.</p> <p>My father and grandfather were in the army, but I failed my army medical because of a spot on my lung. At that time the British were giving some Kashmiris the chance to settle in the UK because the Mirpur area where we lived was going to be flooded by a dam. So I applied, and came to England from Lahore in 1963. We formed the Pakistan Friends League and helped people who couldn\u2019t read and write fill in forms and so on. The Pakistan Cricket Club was the first Asian club in Nottingham.</p> <p>I married very early but it wasn\u2019t happy, and so I was separated when I came here. I became a bus driver and over time I made friends, but I always tried to see Aslam as much as possible. He was a family man, while I was alone. I had another marriage here. It didn\u2019t work out, but we are on friendly terms and have a son.</p> <p>My English friends are different from people I knew in Kashmir because we don\u2019t have the same family integration. Aslam knows my family, I know his family; my friends are his friends and his friends are mine. I live with my nephew and his family and when they go on holiday I call Aslam so we can get together. God gave me relatives, and I thank God I can choose my friends.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He and I stayed in touch wherever we were. We can talk on the telephone for hours</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Aslam </strong>I learned tolerance and respect from this man and I believe I am still learning from him. Even if he disagrees with you, he will not give you a hint of disrespect. I have many other friends but there are few who can disagree with you without hurting you.</p> <p>Sometimes you respect someone like an elder brother or a father, but he is the all-in-one. Even in the days when he was my teacher, we would chat and go on excursions, and in this country our friendship grew.</p> <p>I came to England before him, as a law student in 1961, but I got interested in literature and started writing for one of the Urdu weekly publications. I went back to Kashmir and got married, then came back; since 1970 I have been in the Midlands, where I started a magazine.</p> <p>Somehow he and I stayed in touch wherever we were. We can talk on the telephone for hours. We are interested in history, geography, music, sport, you name it, and he\u2019s a fantastic cook. One minute we are talking about the six a cricketer has just hit, the next about boxing or wrestling. Mohammed is in many ways an unfortunate person. He could have been one of the outstanding Pakistan cricketers had he been given the chance \u2013 and I\u2019m not just saying this because he is my friend. No one from Kashmir represents Pakistan in sport because there is no investment.</p> <p>It\u2019s sad that a lot of our friends have passed away, but those of us who are still alive and well keep in touch, and we remember the others all the time. I have three daughters and three sons and mainly celebrate Eid and Christmas with family, but for weddings and funerals we bring all our extended family and friends together. I think we would have remained friends no matter what, and I believe that even in the next life we will be friends.</p> <h2><strong>Cynthia Barlow, 72, and Anne Austen, 71: friends for 54 years</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"947da62a1a884e3dd47eaa0828356c77e5f246f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947da62a1a884e3dd47eaa0828356c77e5f246f9/0_2140_3805_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cynthia (left) and Anne, who first met in 1962.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cynthia (left) and Anne, who first met in 1962.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Butler for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many people don\u2019t know how to react when something terrible happens, but Anne understood just being there was important</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Cynthia </strong>We met in 1962 on our first day at Nottingham University \u2013 Anne was in the room opposite mine. Women were a tiny part of the university population then and I think that encouraged us to be supportive of each other. She was from a much more educated background than I was and I didn\u2019t feel as knowledgable. My family life was extremely difficult and I knew I would never live at home again. The last summer holiday we were students I spent at Anne\u2019s house in north London.</p> <p>There were concerts every weekend, and a wider circle of people that we are still in contact with, but Anne is my oldest friend. Every summer when my daughter was small we went to the seaside at Hastings and Anne was often there because that was where her parents lived. She worked abroad mostly, in Asia and Africa, but we would meet when she came back and yak away.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1331_testimonies/page10.shtml\">My daughter was killed in 2000</a> when she was 26. She was on her bicycle and a concrete mixer lorry turned left across her path. There was an inquest, which was rubbish, and the driver was acquitted. I went into a complete zombie state.</p> <p>People find it difficult when you\u2019ve been bereaved. They don\u2019t know what to say \u2013 they don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing and so sometimes they end up saying nothing at all. It wasn\u2019t like that with Anne, I think because we had been friends for so long. She was very practical, and that counts.</p> <p>About a year after my daughter died, Anne came to stay with me and she said, \u201cYou used to like art, so I\u2019ll take you to an exhibition.\u201d It was a Sunday afternoon and we ended up at the Royal Academy, where there was an exhibition of <a href=\"http://www.worldofdante.org/gallery_botticelli.html\">Botticelli\u2019s drawings for Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy</a>. I can remember walking up the stairs and seeing a notice with the first words from the poem \u2013 \u201cMidway along the journey of our life, I woke to find myself in a dark wood\u201d \u2013 and I connected with it. I thought, \u201cSo I\u2019m not the first person this has happened to,\u201d and as I went through the exhibition I instinctively knew that it was helping me to think.</p> <p>I realised that I had got so depressed because I felt I had let my daughter down. I began to see it wasn\u2019t me who had let her down \u2013 it was the system. I decided I was going to tackle everything and everybody who had done something in relation to her death that I didn\u2019t think was right. Now I\u2019m chair of victims\u2019 charity <a href=\"http://www.roadpeace.org/\">RoadPeace</a>.</p> <p>My daughter was my only child. My relationship with her father ended when she was small and she was the most precious person in my life. So many people don\u2019t know how to react when something terrible happens, but Anne understood that just being there was important.</p> <p><br><strong>Anne </strong>Cynthia was always very warm and grounded. Half the time in Nottingham our doors were open and we drank endless cups of coffee; that\u2019s probably my most vivid memory of being a student. We were away from home for the first time and there was a lot of sharing.</p> <p>My career was in international development but I knew I would come back to Britain eventually. If you work overseas you can get very lost and detached in the world of the expat, and I didn\u2019t want that; I wanted to stay connected. I could always rely on Cynthia to keep me up to date with what interested us: social policy, social justice and current affairs from a human perspective.</p> <p>A mutual friend told me Cynthia\u2019s daughter had been killed, but it was when the legal process culminated in a trial that I came and stayed with her for a few weeks. I didn\u2019t really know what to do, but I thought it would be a good idea to have someone around. I didn\u2019t think I would like to be on my own if it was me in that situation. I have two children (a son and a daughter) and I thought for your child to be killed was the worst situation a mother could possibly be in. We used to sit and watch Channel 4 News in Cynthia\u2019s flat; even to this day I think of us sitting together in front of the telly.</p> <p>Our daughters were good friends. They were close in age and we had holidays and outings together when they were little. I was very fond of Cynthia\u2019s daughter. I knew she was planning a life with her boyfriend when she was killed, and when my daughter got married I wanted Cynthia to be there.</p> <p>I predict we will do quite a few more Royal Academy exhibitions now I\u2019m retired. We\u2019re both single, and she\u2019s much better informed than I am, so I follow her lead, but we\u2019re both quite cerebral really. I shrieked when I heard she had got an OBE for her work on road safety \u2013 it was so wonderful. We had a lunch of our old university friends to honour her. I feel her long campaigning battle has been incredibly important.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Ssetumba, 30, and Marjorie Agwang, 27: friends for 18 years</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f5330fd555f8386772d57b77762345a62f4342b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f5330fd555f8386772d57b77762345a62f4342b/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Ssetumba, 30, and Marjorie Agwang, 27: friends for 18 years.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Ssetumba, 30, and Marjorie Agwang, 27: friends for 18 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Butler for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve got some good male friends, too, but she\u2019s top</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Jonathan </strong>I call her Marj or M, or sometimes Sis.

Every morning we had to go to school on the children\u2019s ward, then to playgroup in the afternoon. Sometimes with this illness your whole body is in pain, so it\u2019s hard.</p> <p>You can ask her advice about anything. When I had a problem with a relationship, she was the only person I could talk to. I said, \u201cMarj, I\u2019ve got a girl and I don\u2019t know how to tell her about my sickle cell and epilepsy.\u201d Marj said if she couldn\u2019t take me as I am, she wasn\u2019t meant for me. I really liked that girl, but if she couldn\u2019t accept me, how could she love me? So I told her what Marj said. That was it: she went her way and I went mine. But it was the right advice. One day she would have found out anyway.</p> <p>It\u2019s more common for boys to be friends with boys, and girls with girls. But with friends who have the same illness, you can talk to each other. I like to crack jokes and I think that\u2019s what Marjorie likes about me. She knows I try to keep the illness in the background and look on the positive side.</p> <p>We both joined the gym to keep ourselves healthy, so we meet up and work out. As I get older she is definitely someone I\u2019ll stay in touch with. If I\u2019m walking and she\u2019s in a wheelchair, I\u2019ll push.</p> <p>Sometimes people have taken advantage of me. Having an illness can make you too kind. I just want to thank Marj. I\u2019ve got some good male friends, too, but she\u2019s top of the friends.</p> <p><br><strong>Marjorie </strong>Jonathan has so much humour, even in the most difficult situations. I can be in hospital, annoyed that I\u2019m there, in pain, and he will turn it into something funny. Sometimes I just look at him and laugh. He takes each day as it comes, which is a good thing \u2013 you tend to enjoy life more when you\u2019re not stressing about tomorrow, the day after and next week. I think a lot about the future, especially when it comes to being a woman with sickle cell, but he\u2019s showed me how to embrace the day more and enjoy what\u2019s around me.</p> <p>When I first knew him I was like: does this guy take anything seriously? Can I have a conversation with him? But I found out that I can. If I\u2019m stuck with something, or have financial or family issues, I can talk to him and he\u2019ll be there, no question.</p> <p>I think every friend contributes to your life in a different way. I try to be around people who don\u2019t pull me down with drama, people who encourage and lift me up. Jonathan fits in that category and that\u2019s why I keep him close. There is no romance between us. If a man and a woman with sickle cell have children, they can inherit the illness, and that\u2019s not something I want for my children. I don\u2019t think Jonathan knew that before I told him, but it means I would never look at a man with sickle cell in that way. But I\u2019m encouraging him to settle down and have kids \u2013 I would love to be an auntie.</p> <p>I think hardships make you more authentic. Naturally, you tend to relate to people who have been where you\u2019ve been emotionally. Jon has been there through my down times, and vice versa. I think ours is a friendship that will keep going, that is rooted enough not to let anything sway it or blow it away.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2><strong>Stewart Pringle, 31, and Liam Welton, 30: friends for 30 years</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a7e1ba5e8d074629a4dbb6c0fd0950d5224e04b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a7e1ba5e8d074629a4dbb6c0fd0950d5224e04b/0_1124_3632_4324/840.jpg\" alt=\"Liam (left) and Stewart.\" width=\"840\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liam (left) and Stewart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Butler for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve known each other so long and spent so much time together at every stage of our lives that it\u2019s almost brotherly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Stewart </strong>We met soon after Liam was born \u2013 we\u2019re both from a very small village in the middle of the Northumbrian fells. Liam was in the year below me at school, where we were involved in a few drama productions together starting when we were about 10. Liam played <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugsy_Malone\">Bugsy Malone</a> and I was Dandy Dan, and at high school we were both in Sweeney Todd. Liam was more into fantasy and I was more into horror, and over about five years we made a film based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_in_the_Willows\">The Wind In The Willows</a>. I wrote it, Liam directed it. The idea was that some time after the liberation of Toad Hall, a killer strikes the river bank and starts knocking the characters off in gruesome ways. We put it on video and quite a few people bought it. We\u2019re still in touch with everyone who was in that film.</p> <p>We went to different universities but when a spare room came up in my house in Oxford, Liam came down to live there. We ended up in London and started a horror festival. We\u2019ve known each other so long and spent so much time together at every stage of our lives that it\u2019s almost brotherly. We\u2019ve got the same interests in film, theatre and music \u2013 we both like heavy metal and went to a lot of those gigs together when we were younger.</p> <p>We might have had little scraps but never a big falling-out. We\u2019ve talked about moving out of London together \u2013 me and my partner, Liam and some other friends. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a time when we won\u2019t see each other.</p> <p><br><strong>Liam </strong>One of the best times with Stew was when we were doing Grand Guignol at the <a href=\"http://www.etceteratheatre.com/\">Etcetera Theatre</a> in London. He was operating the lights and I was doing sound; it was a tiny, cramped and freezing little box we were in, like being in a sensory deprivation tank together. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have enjoyed that experience with anyone else. It\u2019s so easy spending time with Stew that it\u2019s almost like spending time on my own\u2026 if I squint, it\u2019s like it\u2019s just me there.</p> <p>Stew has been as present as my parents \u2013 he\u2019s just always been there. My dad was in a band and talks of having had close friends, but it does seem as if that stopped when he had a family. My parents have developed friends as a couple since my sister and I left home, but they were career- and family-focused for a long time so I didn\u2019t have a model of adult friendship. I think I am naturally a follower and Stew is a leader, but I don\u2019t think that has anything to do with age. I gain tremendous satisfaction from helping people realise their ideas. We\u2019ve never had much conflict but I\u2019m a bit flaky. I bring a lot at the very beginning of things and then it all gets a bit serious and I want out, and that has caused some friction. We didn\u2019t see each other for a bit because I decided I didn\u2019t want any part of making films any more.</p> <p>Sometimes people ask: \u201cHow come you don\u2019t ever argue with Stew?\u201d and I get the feeling we only had about 200 arguments in us. I\u2019ve known him 30 years and we\u2019ve both changed a little bit, but perhaps not as much as we like to pretend. The weird foibles that we\u2019ve got, I think we acknowledged in each other a long time ago.</p> <p>Even if we haven\u2019t seen each other for months, once we sit down together, we\u2019re right back to where we were.</p> <p>\u2022 Who is your lifelong friend?

  "<p>If there is one bit of entertainment gossip that never goes away, it is the question of who will play the next <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond\">James Bond</a>. Even when a new Bond is announced \u2013 and four films ago we were given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/08/daniel-craig-id-rather-slash-my-wrists-than-do-another-bond-movie\">Daniel Craig</a>, whose quizzical eyebrows have now haunted the face of the MI6 assassin for a decade \u2013 there is always the question of who\u2019ll take over when that one gets too old for all the shooting and shagging.

Rather suddenly, the smart money is now on Aidan Turner, who stars in the hit BBC1 period drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/poldark\">Poldark</a>. Bookmaker William Hill has made a statement about Turner\u2019s impressive chances, with <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1546703/aidan-turner-is-once-again-favourite-to-be-next-james-bond-ahead-of-james-norton-and-tom-hiddleston/\">the Sun backing up</a> its \u201cstaggering 6/4 odds he\u2019ll nab the role\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/06/bbc-poldark-series-three-aidan-turner\">BBC orders Poldark series three starring Aidan Turner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s such a hot topic that I am told, before interviewing Turner, he will not speak a word about it, which sort of suggests that it is true. Or that he\u2019s trying not to put a foot wrong and say anything that might ruin his chances. Fortunately, our photographer has not been given this warning, and happily asks Turner if he\u2019s going to be the next James Bond. A fixed grin takes over Turner\u2019s face, and he chuckles awkwardly. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask that,\u201d I point out cheerily, my dictaphone sitting between us. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to answer it,\u201d he replies. We are in the photographer\u2019s sunny flat in west London, where Turner\u2019s been happily tussling with a dog (he\u2019s called Hank, and belongs to the photographer\u2019s sister) and chatting to the assistants about how he was a ballroom dancer when he was a kid (he competed at a professional level in Ireland).</p> <p>But when I ask him about the dancing, he says he doesn\u2019t want to talk about that stuff, doesn\u2019t want people digging up his past. He seems to find it embarrassing that, long before he was a TV star in London, he was a dancer in Dublin. I\u2019m slightly surprised, but, given that he\u2019s still grinning, we proceed to other subjects. Turner\u2019s screen career began with a couple of uncredited lines in the first episode of <a href=\"http://www.sho.com/the-tudors\">The Tudors</a> in 2007, followed by various Irish arthouse films, and the bigger role of<a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/dante-gabriel-rossetti-461\"> Dante Gabriel Rossetti </a>in the BBC2 costume drama about the pre-Raphaelites, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lvyq2\">Desperate Romantics</a>. He then stopped being a human being for some time, casting off his earthly shackles to play a vampire in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1349938/\">Being Human</a>, a dwarf in Peter Jackson\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/\">The Hobbit film trilogy</a>, and a werewolf in the action film <a href=\"http://gb.imdb.com/title/tt1538403/\">Mortal Instruments: City of Bones</a>. His return to our DNA saw him make Poldark \u2013 a conflicted 18th-century Cornish posho, who has lost his family wealth in the tin-mining recession \u2013 into an unlikely national heart-throb.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"638d20b79d6d21977cea99469d894a5218710322\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638d20b79d6d21977cea99469d894a5218710322/0_248_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Aidan Turner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t think Poldark knows where he\u2019s at half the time.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bella Howard for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One particular scene \u2013 where he is topless in the fields, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/31/poldark-aidan-turner-topless-scything-voted-top-tv-moment-2015-bbc-radio-times\">hacking away with a scythe</a>, rugged hair falling about his muscular shoulders \u2013 sent the swoonometers racing.

At one point he appeared in just a towel, adding to the hype. So who are all these fans? \u201cPoldark is one of those shows,\u201d Turner says in his soft Irish accent, \u201cthat people my age might say, \u2018Oh, yeah, my mum loves the show,\u2019 or \u2018My auntie loves the show, but <em>I\u2019ve</em> never seen it. But then they seem to know quite a bit about it, all the same\u2026\u201d He laughs. \u201cAnd they\u2019re the person who has recognised me, and I\u2019m just some guy with a beard, walking down Carnaby Street or whatever. I used to get that with The Hobbit a lot, somebody would say, \u2018Oh, my little brother\u2019s really into The Hobbit. I mean <em>I</em> can\u2019t stand it, but would you sign all these photographs I have in my bag?\u2019 And I\u2019d go, \u2018Who do I make it out to? Julie? Oh, OK, your brother\u2019s called Julie, fair enough.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He sits on the sofa, always moving, a bit like a puppy waiting to get off its lead. Today, the flowing Poldark locks are scraped back into a man-bun and he looks like any young fashionable guy you\u2019d see in Soho, where he is living.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1fe1368283e34c26eac967c028ca69eac9b3ef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1fe1368283e34c26eac967c028ca69eac9b3ef7/18_0_1638_2048/800.jpg\" alt=\"With Dean O\u2019Gormon in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Dean O\u2019Gormon in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar/New Line Cinema</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cast are about to start filming the third series, while we are about to start watching the second. Adapted from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poldark\">Winston Graham\u2019s novels</a>, the action follows the ruggedly handsome Captain Ross Poldark returning to his native Cornwall after fighting in the American War of Independence, to take over his father\u2019s mine. His family\u2019s fortunes have plummeted because tin is now cheaper elsewhere: this is the start of globalisation. The people of Cornwall are starving, and Poldark is caught between them and his wealthy cousins. He is also caught between two surprising love affairs, again straddling the class divide. The man is compelling viewing because he doesn\u2019t give a damn about the things he is supposed to.</p> <p>I ask Turner if he intentionally makes his character so hard to read. \u201cWell, it struck me that Ross is a real man \u2013 not a heroic, legendary guy who comes into town and is the people\u2019s hero, like Robin Hood. There\u2019s a lot wrong with Ross, which is what I love about him \u2013 that he\u2019s a multitude of ups and downs and rights and wrongs. And I don\u2019t think he knows where he\u2019s at half the time.\u201d Poldark begins in love with Elizabeth, his childhood sweetheart, but she marries his cousin and (spoiler alert, if you haven\u2019t caught up with season one) he begins a relationship with his mysterious maid, Demelza.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Horse riding is a confidence game, like everything. It\u2019s just blagging.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEmotionally, he\u2019s way more comfortable being a soldier and being with the lads than he is with Demelza and his baby, Julia. Love is a complete mystery to him. He can\u2019t quite figure that out \u2013 does he still fancy Elizabeth, is he still in love with Elizabeth? Does he feel betrayed? Was it her fault? All these questions are still there in the second series. And they\u2019re real questions.\u201d</p> <p>It has recently been revealed that, in the novels, Ross rapes Elizabeth, but the television programme has turned that moment into consensual sex. Turner suggests that this might have been overblown. \u201cThere\u2019s very little in the book, just two lines. I think he just picks up Elizabeth and sort of frogmarches her up the stairs. We don\u2019t do it that way at all, really. I mean Ross kind of \u2013 well, you\u2019ll see. I think it\u2019s well-measured. I think if we had taken it literally from the book, it wouldn\u2019t have seemed like Ross.\u201d</p> <p>If this causes any kind of public outcry, there\u2019s a chance that Turner won\u2019t even know about it, as he claims not to read anything written about the programme. \u201cWhen a show that I\u2019m in goes out, I don\u2019t really watch it. I don\u2019t Google it or tune into any of the press.\u201d He doesn\u2019t search for mentions of his own name on Twitter? \u201cOh my God, no. Can you imagine? I\u2019d have a nervous breakdown. My friends and family even know not to send me stuff. The agents won\u2019t send me the ratings, either. None of that matters a great deal to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48ee48f271520bbd22130ebe68128736907afd7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48ee48f271520bbd22130ebe68128736907afd7b/0_0_6689_4460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You freak yourself out sometimes, thinking: what if I forget my lines?\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You freak yourself out sometimes, thinking: what if I forget my lines?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bella Howard for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He thinks about this. \u201cMind you, they\u2019ll send me funny stuff now and again.\u201d Like what? \u201cLike, \u2018Poldark\u2019s hair has its own Twitter account.

I mean, I was talking about the head hair, but the chest hair had something else going on over the summer, so God knows, these days.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s laughing a lot, but he does seem rather appalled. \u201cSocial media isn\u2019t really my bag. I don\u2019t do it.\u201d He doesn\u2019t even have a secret Facebook account? \u201cI don\u2019t! Not because I\u2019m an actor and I want to protect my profile or whatever that means. It\u2019s just not for me. I literally don\u2019t care about it. I email people, I text people, and even that I have trouble keeping up with. There is shit that I really need to get done that I don\u2019t get done, so imagine me on Facebook or Instagram \u2013 ah, it would just be a disaster. I was an hour and a half late to this interview today, for Christ\u2019s sake! What would I be like if I was on Facebook?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t know what it is about actors but some of us are inherently lazy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I get the strong impression that he doesn\u2019t want to discuss being a heart-throb, or the debate around objectifying men that opened up in the wake of Poldark\u2019s topless imagery. I bring it up and a half smile/half grimace appears across his face. He doesn\u2019t speak. I say, \u201cDo you just want to say that you\u2019re sick of it, then we can move on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of it,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s move on.\u201d</p> <p>Turner grew up in Dublin. His mother, Eileen, is an accountant and his father, Pearse, is an electrician. In his early teens, Turner sometimes accompanied his dad to work. \u201cHe used to call me the Little Apprentice. I used to pop around with him and do odd jobs. But that kind of manual labour\u2026 I don\u2019t have it in me. My dad loves what he does and he\u2019s still intrigued by it.

In fact,\u201d he says, glancing at the ceiling, \u201cthey\u2019re the same 60 watt kind I have in my house. But after that I worked in a cinema for two years, while I was at school. I was an usher for a while, then I worked selling popcorn. Never got allowed in the projection room \u2013 that would have been asking for trouble. But maybe that was where it started \u2013 I used to go and watch movies when I should have been working. I used to sneak around and check out all these films. I remember American Beauty was on, Fight Club was on\u2026\u201d Ah, that halcyon bit of the 1990s when Hollywood started getting good again. He nods, \u201cI\u2019ve seen both those films more than a dozen times each. I was a terrible usher. You\u2019re only supposed to go in for five minutes to check the screen is right and everyone\u2019s OK. I totally took advantage. But,\u201d he reflects, with a touch of irony, \u201cthat was my entrance into the movie world.\u201d</p> <p>Aged six Turner took up dancing, didn\u2019t like it until he got good and then his competitive streak kicked in; he actually represented Ireland in ballroom and Latin American dancing for 10 years. He didn\u2019t ever ride horses, but when auditioning for Poldark he lied and said he had, then quickly took lessons. \u201cHorse riding is a confidence game, like everything,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just blagging.\u201d</p> <p>He tells me about Poldark\u2019s steed. \u201cHe\u2019s an Irish horse! He was picked up at Smithfield market in Dublin, weirdly enough. Seamus is about as Irish as you can get, for a horse\u2019s name. He doesn\u2019t stand still. He\u2019s so smart, when he sees the clapperboard and hears it he wants to take off. So they can\u2019t say \u2018action\u2019 on set. I think he may have been Tom Cruise\u2019s horse on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325710/\">The Last Samurai</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Did he not tell him for definite? \u201cSeamus? No, he just mentioned something.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 17, Turner took his first drama class and realised he was more than happy to give up other academic pursuits. Had he hated education? \u201cIt was more that the acting thing just happened. In my last eight months of school, I realised that this was what I wanted to do. I was very lucky to know \u2013 I mean, so many friends of mine, of my age, are still hopping around doing different courses, career changes. I realised early on.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if acting was a normal activity among his friends. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t really normal for me. I didn\u2019t really care what people thought. If you tell people you want to be an actor, they say, \u2018Jesus. Best of luck.\u2019 I think everyone was quite surprised because I wasn\u2019t a theatre kid, I never went to see plays. I didn\u2019t do puppet shows in the living room for my grandparents, no, no. My brother did.

You can constantly fuck up. That\u2019s the luxury of going to drama school because, if you make those mistakes professionally, then it\u2019s not quite the same; people aren\u2019t so forgiving.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFMUN-CIPUg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZFMUN-CIPUg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Poldark.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He went straight from graduation to a job at the Abbey Theatre, Ireland\u2019s national theatre, and remained there, as a stage actor, for five years because play after play came up, and he was always in demand.

What if I forget my lines in the middle of that monologue?\u2019 But when you walk on stage, that\u2019s how you know if it\u2019s for you. There is clarity. Your body is good at kicking into gear and knowing why you are there, what part of your brain to use.\u201d</p> <p>After auditioning for The Hobbit, his friends assumed that he would at least read the book. \u201cAnd I thought, fuck that, I\u2019m not going to read it unless I\u2019m cast in it!\u201d He says the filming schedule for Poldark is intense, \u201cbut you wait for months and months to work, and then you get given the shooting schedule and you go straight through it, circling your days off.

On the one hand, he keeps joking about being a layabout, on the other, he\u2019s desperate to be taken seriously as an actor, and only that. When I try to ask about other areas of his life, he puts up wall after wall. He will talk about Brexit and the possibility of Irish reunification off the record, but has to \u201csteer clear of politics\u201d when the tape is running \u201cso I don\u2019t get shot when I get home\u201d.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t want to give me anecdotes from his life, because that is \u201ctrivial\u201d, and says he is worried that \u201cyou just slip into that celebrity bullshit and people don\u2019t give a fuck about what you\u2019re doing with the show.

Fifteen years seems like a really long time. \u201cI know. I don\u2019t know what kept us,\u201d he says, \u201cit was only an old email address that sort of reignited it.

  "<p>Shyness seems an obvious theme for a writer. Writers are often natural introverts and onlookers, and the printed word allows them to convey meaning to others independently of their bodily presence. For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/30/sigmund-freud-unconscious-theories\">Sigmund Freud</a>, writing was \u201cin its origin the voice of an absent person\u201d: it let us transcend the limitations of our mumbling, blushing selves. And yet, as I have found when trying to write about my own shyness, as a subject it poses problems. It is a low-level, lingering, nebulous feeling, hard to turn into a story or drama. It has none of the pathos or narrative momentum of major life events like love, loss, illness and grief. Shy characters are not born protagonists; they are too passive to propel stories along. And shyness is tricky to write about autobiographically without succumbing to the hectoring self-pity that is the death of good prose.</p> <p>Shyness, often seen merely as a wish to withdraw from others, can also amount to an undue interest in them, a desire for human closeness which defeats itself through fear and doubt. For me, it has less to do with simple timidity than a kind of social deafness, a tin ear for non-verbal cues, a sense that I have failed to grasp some invisible thread that holds communal life together. The shy author often overcompensates for this problem by becoming a field biologist of humanity, a close reader of the semiotics of the social world.</p> <p>The English fiction writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/24/a-brief-survey-of-the-short-story-elizabeth-taylor\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> certainly fits this profile. She would spend days on end just walking around Buckinghamshire market towns, sitting on her own in the Tudor tearooms, public gardens and pubs, listening in. And then she would pour into her novels and stories all her interest in social ineptitude and her hatred of fake sociability. Awkwardness and embarrassment are, Meg and Patrick in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3651494/The-other-Liz-Taylor.html\"><em>The Soul of Kindness</em></a> (1964) agree, \u201cunderrated forms of suffering\u201d. \u201cI never think embarrassment is a trivial emotion,\u201d says Beatrice in Taylor\u2019s story \u201cHester Lilly\u201d (1954). Taylor\u2019s characters live lives of stockbrokerish comfort and silent anguish, baking sponges for coffee mornings, hosting bridge evenings and enduring formula luncheons that always start with sherry and end with fool. One of her opening sentences beautifully condenses the way that people steel themselves to join in with these rituals: \u201cIn the morning, Charles went down the garden to practise calling for three cheers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e131c3607fa4320d8f218e29120539c3c2b6130a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e131c3607fa4320d8f218e29120539c3c2b6130a/0_772_4678_3828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Shyness is nice\u2019 \u2026 Morrissey, left, on stage with Johnny Marry and the Smiths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"818\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Shyness is nice\u2019 \u2026 Morrissey, left, on stage with Johnny Marr and the Smiths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The New Zealand writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/30/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Janet Frame</a> also nails perfectly these unseen dramas of shyness. Her narrators are full of hidden fire and verve, the opposite of the fearful self they present to others. As a child, Frame\u2019s innate introversion was aggravated by her embarrassment at her wild frizz of red hair and her rotten teeth, which led her to cover her mouth when talking. She began to invest everything in her writing, retreating into a parallel world she called the \u201cMirror City\u201d. This city came to seem more real to her than the real world she floated through like a silent, timorous ghost. She was loath to spend the one currency of hers that might have any worth in this real world \u2013 talking about her life in the Mirror City \u2013 for fear its magic would be disenchanted. She would not even divulge the titles of her books to people she met. What she called her \u201cprimitive shyness\u201d about her writing made her unwilling \u201cto reduce or drain into speech the power supply of the named\u201d.</p> <p>All writers have this sense of a split between their literary and actual selves; for Frame, the split was full-blown and blighted her life. \u201cIn conversation I am bedevilled,\u201d she wrote in 1955. \u201cIn written expression an angel will visit.\u201d Her muteness or incoherence in the flesh meant that many who met her took her for an idiot. She had channelled all the clever and lucid parts of her character into the self that sat alone at a writing desk, waiting for an angel to appear.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are all tongue-tied; some of us are just more aware of it than others</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Frame\u2019s fictional alter egos are tongue-tied women who think that the babble and prattle of the spoken word can never match the depth and nuance of writing. \u201cWhat is the use of speech?\u201d the unspeaking Erlene reflects in Frame\u2019s novel <em>Scented Gardens for the Blind </em>(1963). \u201cOn and on, saying nothing, the tattered bargain-price words, the great red-flagged sale of trivialities, the shutdown sellout of the mind?\u201d In another Frame novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/29/fiction.reviews\"><em>Towards Another Summer</em></a>, Grace Cleave, an excruciatingly shy writer, has rashly accepted Philip Thirkettle\u2019s invitation to spend the weekend with him and his young family. (The book was published posthumously because it is based on a real weekend that Frame spent at the home of the Guardian writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/27/geoffrey-moorhouse-obituary\">Geoffrey Moorhouse</a>.) For Grace, the weekend is hell. She rehearses platitudinous lines in her head \u2013 \u201cI do like cheese on toast\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve so enjoyed your cooking\u201d \u2013 and sometimes manages to say them. But mostly her words \u201cscuttle to the sheltering foliage of incoherence\u201d. She longs to sit in her London bedsit at her Olivetti typewriter, with the warm light of the Anglepoise shining over the keys, \u201csending out noisy signals to herself\u201d. Frame, like many shy writers, has a sobering sense that language always, in the end, sells us short. Words are a compromise, aimed at reaching fleetingly across the unbridgeable divide between us all. We are all tongue-tied; some of us are just more aware of it than others.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/agathachristie\">Agatha Christie</a>, like Frame, avoided social gatherings for fear of seeming, as she put it, \u201cimbecile with shyness\u201d. She, too, made amends for her inarticulacy in the flesh with fluency on the page. In her case this resulted in almost 100 books, millions of words to act as counter-ballast to her real-life reticence. But Christie\u2019s solution was quite different to Frame\u2019s. It was to create characters who were starkly her opposite \u2013 like the nosy and fearless Miss Marple, or the hyper-confident Hercule Poirot, an actor manqu\u00e9 who sees the apprehending of the villain as an occasion for bravura intellectual display. \u201cIf you are doubly burdened, first by acute shyness, and secondly by only seeing the right thing to do or say 24 hours later, what can you do?\u201d Christie wrote in the Daily Mail in 1938. \u201cOnly write about quick-witted men and resourceful girls whose reactions are like greased lightning.\u201d She confided to her diary that she thought Poirot \u201can egocentric creep\u201d.</p> <p>Writers find all kinds of indirect ways of writing about their shyness. Another of these oblique strategies is to conjure up an imaginary world in which shyness is a common feeling \u2013 one that, rather than just alienating people from each other, unites them in their fears and vulnerabilities. For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/30/garrison-keillor-retiring-lake-wobegon-america-beautiful-tour\">Garrison Keillor</a>, who grew up a gangly, awkward boy with \u201ca powerful wish to be invisible\u201d, the fictional prairie town of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon\">Lake Wobegon</a> serves this role. Here, in a shyness-cultivating part of the world somewhere north-west of Minneapolis, even close friends stand an arm\u2019s length apart, romantic passion is voiced as mild interest and the Norwegian bachelor farmers all eat shy-busting Powdermilk biscuits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44f53020740b828522fad5f73a14e55b3ba21a8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44f53020740b828522fad5f73a14e55b3ba21a8d/0_0_1797_1178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Upper-midwest diffidence \u2026 A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969), based on Charles Schulz\u2019s Peanuts comic strip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Upper-midwest diffidence \u2026 A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969), based on Charles Schulz\u2019s Peanuts comic strip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/09/obamas-peanuts-president-writes-foreword-to-charles-schulz-anthology\">Charles Schulz\u2019s Peanuts</a> comic strip, of which Keillor is a lifelong fan, taps into the same mood of upper-midwest diffidence. Charlie Brown is Schulz\u2019s own shyness in cartoon form. With his anonymous round head, Charlie suffers that familiar seesawing between feeling horribly invisible most of the time and horribly visible some of the time. Schulz\u2019s virtuosic twist is to give him a dog, Snoopy, who is a brilliant wordless communicator, and whose role is to make his master feel even more inadequate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tove Jansson\u2019s Moomins books are full of introverts, shrewish animals who hide under sinks, never saying a word</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When it appeared on a page of noisy comic strips all jostling for attention, Peanuts drew the eye with its clean lines and white spaces, the boldness with which it said so little. The mood music of Minnesotan weather \u2013 the softly falling snowflakes, the frozen ponds on which the characters skate silently and the stone-faced snowmen they build and befriend, only for them to melt away \u2013 adds to the general ambience of stillness and quiet. In Peanuts, problems remain unresolved and words unspoken. Its signature note is the bathetic non-ending, a final panel with Charlie Brown exhaling a <a href=\"https://thematbickley.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/charlie-brown-sigh.jpg\">*sigh*</a>, smiling wonkily with sweat beads shooting off his face or blushing in a way that fills his face with diagonal lines. Schulz knew that shyness has no narrative arc: the shy just have to carry on being shy. A daily comic strip was his way of dealing with this, communicating with the world remotely by creating his own world with a few bold pen strokes, and signing his name at the end.</p> <p>Schulz came to believe, with classically midwest self-deprecation, that his own inhibitions were just inverted narcissism. \u201cShyness,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis the overtly self-conscious thinking that you are the only person in the world; that how you look and what you do is of any importance.\u201d But the lesson of Peanuts is quite the reverse. Who, after all, is a better model of humanity: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_van_Pelt\">Lucy van Pelt</a>, who shouts at the world with bone-shuddering and misplaced conviction, or Charlie Brown, a gentle, fair-minded stoic?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/dec/25/moomins-books-fiction-perfect-family-tove-jansson\">Why the Moomins are fiction\u2019s perfect family</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/tove-jansson\">Tove Jansson</a>\u2019s Moomins books are also full of introverts, shrewish animals who hide under sinks or wander around the world in search of the horizon, never saying a word. Jansson\u2019s scraperboard illustrations scratch these characters out of a background of black India ink, as if they are emerging warily out of the gloom. With only the thinnest pen line \u2013 a tiny widening of the eye pupil, a downturned eyebrow or the sole of a foot treading charily through snow \u2013 she conveys their fear. But the Moomins themselves are more successful role models for the shy. They like to wander in the forest alone, enjoying its silence and stillness, or to burrow into warm, private spaces. But they sulk and skulk only fleetingly. Mostly they retreat so as to think deeply and make something \u2013 a painting, a poem or a boat carved out of bark \u2013 as a way of whittling meaning out of a frightening world. Jansson\u2019s lesson is not that shy people should come out of their shells; it is that they should embrace that shyness and put it to artful use.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"xx\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=Content-Type content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt;&lt;link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=http://assets.guim.co.uk/stylesheets/webfonts.d35b9e8c33865a46b3231a20c9f960b0.css&gt;&lt;base href=. target=_blank&gt;&lt;style type=text/css&gt;.break:before{content:'';display:block;width:30%;margin-top:23px;height:3px;background-color:#fdadba}p{margin:0}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p class=break&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u2766</p> <p>Freud saw writing as one of the \u201cprosthetic gods\u201d that humans have created, partly to shield themselves from the world. By rendering us temporarily invisible and disembodied, the written word allows us to communicate with other people at one remove. Shy writers can use the technologies of writing in the same way, as both a buffer against and a conduit to others. Janet Frame loved her typewriter as if it were an extra limb that connected her with the world, and felt as orphaned without it as today\u2019s teenagers when unglued from their phones. The most assertive she ever became was when fighting to keep her typewriter while confined in New Zealand\u2019s mental hospitals. Agatha Christie, meanwhile, was an early adopter of the portable tape recorder. Dictating her words to a secretary made her self-conscious, and she would stumble and lose her rhythm. A tape machine, whirring and wheezing away, was a friendly audience, and it let her click the pause button and gather up her thoughts. For Garrison Keillor, the radio microphone did the trick. By mastering radio\u2019s synthetic spontaneity, dropping well-timed \u201cy\u2019knows\u201d and \u201ckindas\u201d into his sentences, he managed to turn himself into someone else, someone who could speak freely without worrying about people yawning or looking at their watches. Almost all shy people, I have found, have the same fear as Keillor and me: boring others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc2e78bbb3033d4d0527d4bc244d411a65c1a0a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc2e78bbb3033d4d0527d4bc244d411a65c1a0a0/0_181_3072_2015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moomins creator Tove Jansson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Embrace shyness and put it to artful use \u2026 Moomins creator Tove Jansson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lehtikuva OY/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing, like all kinds of performance, is a chance for the shy to acquire a veneer of confidence and ease.

And yet many of his songs, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dZSLJwKlEI\">\u201cHalf a Person\u201d</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H888yfanNr8\">\u201cNever Had No One Ever\u201d</a>, are about loneliness, unrequited feeling, climbing into empty beds, feeling ugly and unwanted. His lyrics veer cagily between the first and second person, a teasing mix of the earnest and the evasive. The Smiths song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyaSQLlS5e8\">\u201cAsk\u201d</a> seems to be coaxing someone, perhaps Morrissey\u2019s younger self, out of his shyness, but it can\u2019t decide whether \u201cshyness is nice\u201d or not.</p> <p>Morrissey manages paradoxically to appear secure, to bare his soul without ever seeming needy or inadequate. His odd mix of shyness and confidence is a neat trick to pull off \u2013 and perhaps, today, a necessary one. For in our confessional culture, with its cult of therapeutic openness, shyness seems to be increasingly looked on with confusion and suspicion. A colleague of mine told me that he had given Daphne du Maurier\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/20/rebecca-daphne-du-maurier-classic-literature\"><em>Rebecca</em></a> to a friend, who had come back to him thoroughly affronted by the narrator\u2019s shyness, which he dismissed as \u201carrogance in low heels\u201d.

For her, it was a burdensome virtue \u2013 one you might prefer not to have, but which did at least save you from being \u201ccommon\u201d, an antithetical state to shyness with \u201ca degree of groundless pushing yourself forward\u201d. Bennett eventually decided that this was rubbish, that shy people could be \u201ca bit of a bore\u201d and that \u201csocial ease can and should be faked\u201d. But for Bennett\u2019s characters, shyness is not so easily shaken off. Andy in <em>Getting On</em> (1971) is a virginal youth untouched by the 60s counterculture, whose father mistakenly believes he is living in a \u201chaze of pot and cheap fellowship\u201d. Trevor Hopkins, the polytechnic lecturer in the TV play <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me%E2%80%94I'm_Afraid_of_Virginia_Woolf\"><em>Me \u2013 I\u2019m Afraid of Virginia Woolf</em></a> (1978), cannot pee in a public toilet and always takes a book on buses so he has somewhere to look. Life, impatient of their fears and hesitancies, is leaving these characters behind.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever thought what\u2019s happened to all the shy people?\u201d Andy asks in <em>Getting On</em>. \u201cWhatever happened to reserve, Dad, and self-consciousness? Was it your government that got rid of guilt?\u201d Unlike his father, Andy has already learned that shyness is as resilient as all the other things that the youth cult of the 60s was meant to have swept away, like snobbery, sexual hypocrisy and middle-aged complacency. Bennett\u2019s characters have entered an era in which shyness is no longer the equivocal virtue it had been to his mother, but a disability it is one\u2019s duty to defeat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"867c7e0d606d401498b564ccd60a212f899d908e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/867c7e0d606d401498b564ccd60a212f899d908e/0_0_8533_4617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Successful role models for the shy \u2026 Moomins on the Riviera.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"541\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Successful role models for the shy \u2026 Moomins on the Riviera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Bruce 2014 Handle Productions Oy, Pictak Cie/Moomin Characters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Personal growth is one of today\u2019s growth industries. Its guiding principle is that your personality is plastic and pliable, a skillset you can learn and develop. Our self-help culture trades on stories of people who have transformed themselves from depressed solitaries into social butterflies, the psychological equivalent of those slimmers of the year who pose in their old and now outsized pants. But what Bennett and all these other writers tell us is that shyness cannot simply be \u201cbusted\u201d or \u201cconquered\u201d. It is a stubborn disposition: we can learn to hide it, channel it, finesse it or work around it, but we can never quite defeat it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On reaching old age, Oliver Sacks declared himself 'sorry to be as agonisingly shy at 80 as I was at 20'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even the vicarious communication of print proves an anticlimax. The neurologist and writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/oliver-sacks\">Oliver Sacks</a> grappled with this problem for years, wanting to be noticed for his writing but unsure if this was allowed. When his first book was reviewed in the newspapers, his father, also a doctor, was appalled, for at the time one could be struck off the medical register for advertising. Sacks half-agreed with him, and for years misread the word \u201cpublish\u201d as \u201cpunish\u201d. On reaching old age, he declared himself \u201csorry to be as agonisingly shy at 80 as I was at 20\u201d. Diagnosed with ocular cancer, he would go off on his own to cry, but found that even when alone he was too shy to scream.</p> <p>If they cannot offer me the solace that my shyness might be overcome, have these shy writers taught me anything more useful? Perhaps this: by taking shyness as a subject, they have made it real. All my life I have thought of shyness as a debility, an inadequacy, an absence. But for these writers it is a definite, if painful, quality \u2013 something you are, not something that stops you being who you are. It is less a shrinking away from the world than a redirection of our energies. Rather than smother our sociable impulses, it just makes us social in convoluted ways. Shyness is simply part of being a human, this more or less communal species which happens to be lumbered with a strange gift for turning in and reflecting on itself. There will always be a tension between our gregarious instincts and our desire to creep away from the tribe and be alone with our thoughts. In all of us that tension is differently strung, but surely it was ever thus.</p> <p>It can feel especially hard to be shy in the age of the selfie, when social networks and the smartphone have emboldened people to bring their personal lives into the open in ways that would have seemed bizarre just a few years ago and still seem bizarre to me. Ours is the era of the open-plan office, the library as \u201csocial learning zone\u201d, the meeting as creative \u201csandpit\u201d, the tweet as self-praise: an age of nonstop networking, humblebragging and oversharing.</p> <p>But then I remember that these same technologies have created their own forms of shy art, ones that let us relate to each other in amounts we can control, like a saline drip. Texting, introduced by Nokia in the 90s as an afterthought, took off unexpectedly among shy Finnish teenagers, because it gave those more dexterous with their thumbs than their tongues the chance to be more intrepid than in real life. Texts, tweets and social media updates allow us to blend intimacy with artifice. We can hide behind avatars and emojis, and say the things that embarrass us face-to-face, or experiment with suaver versions of ourselves.</p> <p>Perhaps human ingenuity has conjured up the text message for the same reason it invented the alphabet a few thousand years ago. We want to say what we feel, to open our hearts to others. But we can\u2019t \u2013 not without something to help us do it from afar. So we are all shy authors now. We compose our words carefully with our thumbs, editing and deleting as we go. And then, with a little wince, we press send.</p> <p>\u2022 Joe Moran is professor of English and cultural history at Liverpool John Moores University. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/shrinking-violets.html\"><em>Shrinking Violets: A Field Guide to Shyness</em></a> is published by Profile.</p>",

Using the flaps of cloth that join their arms and legs, they skim expertly past cliff edges and between trees at more than 110mph. After less than a minute they release their parachutes and drift down, whooping, over Chamonix. A day after Zanon\u2019s footage of the flight was posted last September, it had been watched a million times. Since then, it has been watched at least 10 million more.</p> <p>On Wednesday 8 June this year, Zanon returned to Chamonix and climbed the Aiguille du Midi on the other side of the valley for a solo flight. On the Sunday his body was found on the glaciers 5,000ft below. Most likely no one will ever know exactly which small thing went wrong. Small things become big quickly at 110mph. He was 33.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVuI_S-CmaI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WVuI_S-CmaI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dario Zanon flying the Rock Star Line in September last year.

In May 2015, <a href=\"http://www.epictv.com/media/podcast/dean-potter-discusses-release-of-controversial-film-when-dogs-fly-%7C-epictv-climbing-daily-ep471/601657\">Dean Potter</a>, a famous US climber and wingsuit flyer, died with his friend Graham Hunt. They had jumped from Taft Point in Yosemite Park, California. In July last year, the record-holding Colombian wingsuit flyer <a href=\"http://www.outdoorjournal.in/news-2/base-jumping-accident-in-switzerland-claims-wingsuiter-jhonathan-florez/\">Jhonathan \u201cthe Birdman\u201d Florez</a> died during practice in Switzerland.

In 2006, the British Parachute Association recorded 39,100 first jumps. Last year there were 59,679. Numbers of \u201cfull members\u201d \u2013 regular skydivers \u2013 have been rising at a similar rate. The British Mountaineering Council had about 25,000 individual members in 2000. Last September there were \u201calmost 55,000\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2014/02/20/everest-numbers-latest-summit-stats\">The number of people climbing Everest</a> has rocketed since the 1990s. The proportion of women climbers is increasing too, up from about 16% in 2002 (<a href=\"https://www.thebmc.co.uk/participation-in-climbing-mountaineering\">BMC figures</a>) to 36% now (Sport England figures). Hang-gliding numbers have suffered since the 1990s, according to Michelle Lanman at the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (\u201cThe kit is so much heavier\u201d). But paragliding and paramotoring (paragliding with a giant fan) are doing very nicely. SurfingGB also reports that \u201cBritish surfing continues to grow rapidly\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C_jPcUkVrM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-C_jPcUkVrM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Uli Emanuele\u2019s video for GoPro. He died this week.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cYou just get into it and then progressively build up, build up\u201d says Jess Cox, 27, an instructor at her father\u2019s business, <a href=\"http://www.flysussex.com\">Fly Sussex Paragliding</a>, near Lewes. \u201cBetter flights involve going higher, further, doing debagging or acrobatic stuff.\u201d Sorry, debagging? She shows me a video on her phone. It was recorded by a friend shortly after they had both jumped off a 7,000ft mountain in Turkey. Cox is gliding high above a gleaming body of water when suddenly she falls from her harness, surely to her death, until a new paraglider unfurls out of her backpack and she swoops away. \u201cWoo-hoo!\u201d she squeals, watching. \u201cI love it! That was one of the best days of my life. It\u2019s just the most exciting thing I\u2019ve ever done. The high lasts for days. You\u2019re walking around on a cloud when you have a great flight. You really enjoy what you do. You really love it\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the drawback of discovering something you love this much is having to do without it sometimes. \u201cYou can\u2019t let the gap be too long or you get itchy feet,\u201d Cox says. \u201cSome people become completely obsessed, quit their jobs, live in a van and just travel round the world with fabric in the back, leaping off stuff. It does kind of consume you. It\u2019s completely addictive.\u201d When possible, Cox actually flies to work in the morning with her paramotor. She\u2019s never scared, she says, unless you count nerves before competitions. Nor should she be. Like most extreme sports these days, paragliding is much safer than it looks, as long as it\u2019s done properly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86156bf6c52dab1992d885c4f661e5841b817cbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86156bf6c52dab1992d885c4f661e5841b817cbc/26_98_1953_1172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jhonathan Florez, seen here competing in the Wingsuit World Championships in China in 2013, died during practice in Switzerland last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jhonathan Florez, seen here competing in the Wingsuit World Championships in China in 2013, died during practice in Switzerland last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Long Hongtao/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For others, there\u2019s no denying that danger is part of the attraction. On his website, Dickinson says that \u201cwhen unexpected events happen (birds, dead tree branches, etc) \u2026 I feel like I am operating in pure survival mode. I can feel my heart rate speed up, my senses heighten, and my focus narrow so that everything seems to almost slow down. During these moments I try to only focus on the present, the immediate here and now. I think this purity of thought and mind is one of the many reasons I continue to do what I do. Being able to escape the noise, clutter and business of daily life is a rare treat in this world.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the bright beginning of a hot day and Tim Cox gathers the amateur paragliders and explains what they are going to do. I count 16 men and four women. Mark, 28, and Andrew, 39, are both performers at Glyndebourne. \u201cWe had this day off and I thought, \u2018Let\u2019s go and do something stupid,\u2019\u201d Andrew says. He\u2019s done a skydive once before and it terrified him. \u201cI just remember thinking, \u2018Hold it together, hold it together, hold it together\u2019. I was desperate to be on the ground.\u201d He\u2019s hoping this will be a bit calmer. Mark, on the other hand, is a fight director and well up for it. He\u2019s done a bit of kite-surfing, diving and caving, but not yet anything up high. I think it\u2019s just for people who don\u2019t do very well at a barbecue,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many of our colleagues are happy to sit with a bottle of prosecco in the sun for four hours,\u201d he says. \u201cI get fucking bored. Let\u2019s go and jump off a hill!\u201d He\u2019s brought his GoPro, mostly to take clips with which to taunt his partner, who wishes she were here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/wingsuit_web/giv-310753mfFaNqxnBwf/\" data-alt=\"How wingsuits work\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/wingsuit_web/giv-310753mfFaNqxnBwf/\">How wingsuits work</a> <figcaption>Sometimes referred to as \u2018birdman suits\u2019 a wingsuit flight ends by deploying a parachute.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Martin, 25, works in advertising in London. He did a tandem paraglide with an instructor a few years ago, and the experience lingered, so he\u2019s back to have a go on his own. He admits to being \u201ca little bit nervous\u201d. Among all the joshing of the others, he seems quiet and attentive. Paul, 59, has been paragliding four times before, twisting his ankle on the last. He works in insurance and has always enjoyed running, swimming and climbing. He once had a pilot\u2019s licence. When he was diagnosed with cancer six years ago, he got more serious about his fitness and finally lost enough weight to try paragliding. He calls his cancer Nigel and takes pleasure in ignoring its demands. \u201cThis is one in the eye for Nigel,\u201d he says, as we climb the hill up to the launch site. He postponed some chemotherapy to be here.</p> <p>Paragliding looks easy, at least to start with. The equipment is not a parachute but an inflatable wing, which is laid flat on the hilltop, then fills with air, takes shape and lifts fliers off the ground. Once the basics of landing and equipment-checking are explained, the tandem fliers are strapped into a big black seat, hooked up to an instructor, dragged back by the glider pulling as it rises, then a few quick steps launch them forwards into the air. The first flier, Andrew, is up 10 minutes after we arrive. \u201cBloody hell,\u201d says Martin.</p> <p>The rest take off, and it\u2019s clear they\u2019re having a good time. Smoothly, gracefully, they glide back and forth over the hillside until it looks almost dull, this \u201cboating around\u201d, as the initiated called it. Drifting down from the tandems come snatches of conversation that you might well exchange over prosecco. When required, the instructors liven things up with big swings and spirals, which look very exciting. Their control is so good that they can come over and hover within touching distance while we talk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56b70b8e5509e24f342270969a9be582d47260b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56b70b8e5509e24f342270969a9be582d47260b0/276_222_3790_2273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Sutton, the man who parachuted into the London Olympics stadium dressed as James Bond, was killed wingsuit flying in the Swiss Alps in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Sutton, the man who parachuted into the London Olympics stadium dressed as James Bond, was killed wingsuit flying in the Swiss Alps in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CHAMUSSY/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Science teacher Becky, 35, sits next to me, watching her banker boyfriend, John, enjoy his 39th birthday present. \u201cIt\u2019s like wearing a nappy,\u201d he says when first strapped in. \u201cThat was awesome,\u201d he says on landing. Becky did a skydive once (\u201ccrazy at the beginning\u201d) and a bungee jump (\u201cmuch worse, because you have to step off\u201d). They didn\u2019t trigger in her the addiction that it did in Jess. She talks about the skydive like it was a first taste of marzipan \u2013 good, yes, not over-rated, no particular need to do it again. \u201cIt\u2019s trying new things, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she says. \u201cLife would be a bit boring if you don\u2019t try new things.\u201d</p> <p>Was life boring before extreme sports? It was certainly less safe than it is now. (Look up the violent crime and road accident statistics.) Some say Evel Knievel started the fad by showing kids that nearly dying could be cool. Some say nonsense, it was Sondre Norheim. Or Otto Lilienthal. Or Franz Reichelt. Or Leslie Irvin. Or George Freeth. If you have no idea who those people were, then we haven\u2019t reached the point yet where the pioneers of downhill skiing, gliding, parachuting, skydiving and surfing are household names, but it is clear that what they started is no fad. You probably know somebody who has done all the things these men were considered lunatics for trying. You may have tried a few yourself.</p> <p>The Dangerous Sports Club needs a special mention, in part for embodying the crazed inventiveness and nonconformist ethos of extreme sport. Formed by a group of well-to-do friends at Oxford University, the DSC liked to think up perilous capers to perform drunk and in black tie, such as a descent down the ski slopes of St Moritz on a Louis XIV dining set or a grand piano, or sailing through storms to the remote islet of Rockall, then holding a tea party. A younger member of the DSC later built the giant trebuchet, which fired people 100ft into a net, eventually killing a 19-year-old student called Dino Yankov. The great legacy of the DSC, however, is bungee jumping, which they performed for the first time on Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol on April Fool\u2019s Day 1979, after a night of drinking, without any preliminary tests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cbfa06b37674ad6ce8362f58eb16ea08693f24a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cbfa06b37674ad6ce8362f58eb16ea08693f24a/114_224_2818_1691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sutton with stuntman Gary Connery, in 2012 in Henley-on-Thames, preparing for a jump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sutton with stuntman Gary Connery, in 2012 in Henley-on-Thames, preparing for a jump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Connery Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Safety gets more thought these days, but the spirit of experimentation has never weakened in extreme sport. A decade ago, plain base jumping was the new frontier. (Instead of skydiving from a plane, you use a \u201cbuilding, antenna, span or Earth\u201d \u2013 \u201cspan\u201d not \u201cbridge\u201d because the founders decided that \u201cbabe jumping might not be taken as seriously,\u201d <a href=\"http://stephdavis.co/blog/talking-about-risk\">according to Phil Mayfield</a>, who was one of them.) Today base jumping is tame without a wingsuit, and wingsuits are tame unless you use them to get close to things, at times so close \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C_jPcUkVrM\">Emanuele flying through a 2.6m hole in the rock</a> \u2013 that it is obviously dangerous. But the danger made him famous.</p> <p>Perhaps next it will be jet-powered surfboards. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/jul/31/skydiver-becomes-first-to-land-without-a-parachute-video\">They exist</a>.) Or kids everywhere will imitate <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/high-times-meet-the-russian-kids-who-take-the-worlds-riskiest-photos-20140506\">the Russian roofers</a> who get themselves photographed hanging precariously from tall buildings, and often fall. Last month <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36935087\">Luke Aikins</a> became the first person to skydive without a parachute. After a fall of 25,000ft, he landed in a giant net. \u201cIt is awesome,\u201d he discovered.</p> <p>At times the inventiveness is almost comical. Base jumping blindfolded, or with your dog (that was Potter), or with a parachute attached to piercings in your back: you\u2019ll find all of these online. But then, thanks to rugged cameras, video hosting and social media, these brief but spectacular moments of extreme sport are as well-suited to 2016 as could be. No broadcasters pay billions for skydiving or skateboarding rights just yet, but GoPro, Red Bull and others sponsor some of the best athletes to travel the world making very marketable clips. If we want a reason why extreme sports have flourished so much this century, this neat fit between the makers and the money looks like a good guess.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcbff087e63000fa6d828fca9092f70b0804caf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcbff087e63000fa6d828fca9092f70b0804caf6/90_61_5074_3045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The number of first-time parachute jumps in Britain has increased by 50% the past 10 years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The number of first-time parachute jumps in Britain has increased by 50% the past 10 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Fisher/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And these may still be early days. According to a <a href=\"http://futureof.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-of-Sports-2015-Report.pdf\">report from the US entertainment company Delaware North</a>, 100 hours of GoPro video are uploaded on to YouTube every minute, and sales of action cameras are growing at 50% a year. \u201cBy 2020, extreme sports will challenge professional and collegiate team sports for the title of most-watched category of sports content,\u201d the report says. \u201cToday they\u2019re a blip on the screen compared to the big business of professional sports, but participation in action and adventure sports has surpassed conventional sports at the recreational level.\u201d</p> <p>And where their commercial limits lie, it is hard to say. BMX and snowboarding <a href=\"https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-approves-five-new-sports-for-olympic-games-tokyo-2020\">are Olympic events now</a>, and climbing, skateboarding and surfing will be in 2020. But I wonder whether sports such as wingsuit flying have already passed the limit of safety. Perhaps the same goes for freediving, in which people compete to swim as deep as possible while holding their breath, and where leading proponents, such as Natalia Molchanova and Nicholas Mevoli have recently died.</p> <p>Pushing is part of sport, of course, but what\u2019s being pushed here is safety. A good footballer or tennis player always wants to be tested against better opponents, but their opponents are human, so that can only go so far. In extreme sports, the opponent is danger. As one of the world\u2019s best known climbers and wingsuit flyers, <a href=\"http://www.skydivemag.com/article/reflections-on-wingsuit-base\">Steph Davis, wrote in January</a>, \u201cthe limit comes when you hit the terrain\u201d. Instead, she suggested, \u201cPerhaps progression means something very different. Perhaps it means refining the experience, becoming safer, more elegant and more aware.\u201d Davis has been married twice, to Dean Potter and Mario Richard. Both men died in wingsuit accidents (Potter after their divorce). Maybe the future of extreme sports is learning to be less extreme.</p>",

  "<p>Many people listen to music while they\u2019re carrying out a task, whether they\u2019re studying for an exam, driving a vehicle or even reading a book. Many of these people argue that background music helps them focus. </p> <p>Why, though? When you think about it, that doesn\u2019t make much sense. Why would having two things to concentrate on make you more focused, not less? Some people even go so far as to say that not having music on is more distracting. So what\u2019s going on there?</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear why the brain likes music so much in the first place, although it clearly does. Interestingly, there\u2019s a specific spectrum of musical properties that the brain prefers. <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094446\">Experiments by Maria Witek and colleagues</a> reveal that there needs to be a medium level of syncopation in music to elicit a pleasure response and associated body movement in individuals. What this means in plain English is: music needs to be funky, but not too funky, for people to like it enough to make them want to dance. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/20/is-speed-reading-a-waste-of-time\">Is speed reading a waste of time?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Your own experience will probably back this up. Simple, monotonous beats, like listening to a metronome, aren\u2019t really entertaining. They have low levels of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncopation\">syncopation</a> and certainly don\u2019t make you want to dance. In contrast, chaotic and unpredictable music, like free jazz, has high levels of syncopation, can be extremely off-putting and rarely, if ever, entices people to dance. </p> <p>The middle ground (<a href=\"https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/news/why-does-funk-music-make-us-want-to-dance\">funk music like James Brown is what the experimenters reference most</a>) hits the sweet spot between predictable and chaotic, for which the brain has a strong preference. Most modern pop falls somewhere within this range, no doubt. <br></p> <p></p> <h2>Paying attention</h2> <p>Why would music help us concentrate, though? One argument is to do with attention. </p> <p>For all its amazing abilities, the brain hasn\u2019t really evolved to take in abstract information or spend prolonged periods thinking about one thing. <a href=\"http://nro.sagepub.com/content/20/2/150.full\">We seem to have two attention systems</a>: a conscious one that enables us to direct our focus towards things we know we want to concentrate on and an unconscious one that shifts attention towards anything our senses pick up that might be significant. The unconscious one is simpler, more fundamental, and linked to emotional processing rather than higher reasoning. It also operates faster. So when you hear a noise when you\u2019re alone at home, you\u2019re paying attention to it long before you\u2019re able to work out what it might have been. You can\u2019t help it.</p> <p>The trouble is, while our conscious attention is focused on the task in hand, the unconscious attention system doesn\u2019t shut down; it\u2019s still very much online, scanning for anything important in your peripheral senses. And if what we\u2019re doing is unpleasant or dull \u2013 so you\u2019re already having to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12507690\">force your attention to stay fixed on it</a> \u2013 the unconscious attention system is even more potent. This means that a distraction doesn\u2019t need to be as stimulating to divert your attention on to something else. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some \u200bpeople argue that one of the best music genres for concentration is the video game soundtrack</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Have you ever worked in an open-plan office and been working on a very important task, only to be driven slowly mad by a co-worker constantly sniffing, or sipping their coffee, or clipping their nails? Something quite innocuous suddenly becomes much more infuriating when you\u2019re trying to work on something your brain doesn\u2019t necessarily enjoy.</p> <p>Music is a very useful tool in such situations. It provides non-invasive noise and pleasurable feelings, to effectively neutralise the unconscious attention system\u2019s ability to distract us. It\u2019s much like giving small children a new toy to play with while you\u2019re trying to get some work done without them disturbing you. </p> <h2>Type of music</h2> <p>However, it\u2019s not just a matter of providing any old background noise to keep distractions at bay. A lot of companies have tried using <a href=\"http://cambridgesound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Color-of-Noise.pdf\">pink noise</a> (pdf) \u2013 a less invasive version of white noise \u2013 broadcasting it around the workplace to reduce distractions and boost productivity. But views on the effectiveness of this approach are mixed at best. </p> <p>It seems clear that the type of noise, or music, is important. This may seem obvious: someone listening to classical music while they work wouldn\u2019t seem at all unusual, but if they were listening to thrash metal it would be thought very strange indeed. </p> <p>While the nature and style of the music can cause specific responses in the brain (funky music compels you to dance, sad music <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/i-second-that-emotion-the-emotive-power-of-music-in-advertising.html\">makes you melancholy</a>, motivational music <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychology-workout-music/\">makes you want to keep fit</a>), some studies suggest that it <a href=\"http://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor01141\">really is down to personal preference</a>. Music you like increases focus, while music you don\u2019t impedes it. Given the extreme variation in musical preferences from person to person, exposing your workforce or classroom to a single type of music would obviously end up with mixed results.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/18/how-physical-exercise-makes-your-brain-work-better\">How physical exercise makes your brain work better</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Music also has a big impact on mood \u2013 truly bleak music could sap your enthusiasm for your task. Something else to look out for is music with catchy lyrics. Musical pieces without wordsmight be better working companions, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect\">human speech and vocalisation is something our brains pay particular attention to</a>. <br></p> <h2>Video game soundtracks</h2> <p>Some people argue that one of the best music genres for concentration is the <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3030502/agendas/the-new-playlist-for-more-productive-work-video-game-soundtracks\">video game soundtrack</a>. This makes sense, when you consider the purpose of the video game music: to help create an immersive environment and to facilitate but not distract from a task that requires constant attention and focus. </p> <p>Limitations in the technology used for early games consoles meant the music also tended to be fairly simplistic in its melodies \u2013 think Tetris or Mario. In a somewhat Darwinian way, the music in video games has been refined over decades to be pleasant, entertaining, but not distracting. The composers have (probably unintentionally) been manipulating the attention systems in the brains of players for years now.</p> <p>There are signs that, as technology progresses, this type of theme music is being abandoned, with games producers opting for anything from big orchestral pieces to hip-hop. The challenge will be to maintain the delicate balance of stimulation without distraction. To achieve this, games composers will need to stay focused. Which is ironic. </p> <p><em>Dean Burnett\u2019s first book, The Idiot Brain, all about the weird and confusing properties of the brain, is available now in the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Idiot-Brain-Neuroscientist-Explains-Really/dp/1783350814/ref=sr_1_1_twi_pap_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461961162&amp;sr=1-1\">UK</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Idiot-Brain-What-Your-Really/dp/0393253783/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469736302&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dean+burnett\">US.</a></em></p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s the great deal no one seems to know about. The government is running a scheme whereby older people can buy extra state pension on what experts say are \u201cvery favourable\u201d terms \u2013 but the take-up so far has been shockingly low.</p> <p>The official prediction was that 265,000 people would take advantage of the chance to boost their retirement income by making an upfront payment. But figures published this week show that fewer than 4,000 signed up in the first six months. Here we explain how the scheme works, why you should do it, and things to watch out for.</p> <p><strong>So what\u2019s the deal?</strong> <br>This is called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/statepensiontopup\">state pension top-up</a>\u201d. Basically, you hand over some cash and in return get an extra slice of state pension. You can get between \u00a31 and \u00a325 more a week, and it\u2019s guaranteed extra income for life. It\u2019s protected against inflation, and the top-ups can usually be inherited by your spouse or civil partner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/09/women-pension-age-trap-40000-out-of-pocket\">Women caught in pension age trap \u2018are \u00a340,000 out of pocket\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You are eligible if you are entitled to a UK state pension and reached your state pension age before 6 April 2016. This includes men born before 6 April 1951 (ie, age 65-plus now) and women born before 6 April 1953 (ie, 63-plus).</p> <p>In technical terms, the government has created a new class of voluntary national insurance contributions, Class 3A, and those eligible are being invited to top up their \u201cadditional state pension\u201d (the extra amount you get with your basic state pension that is made up of the state second pension and its predecessor, Serps) via this new class of contributions.</p> <p><strong>How long is this scheme running for?</strong> <br>It went live last autumn and is available until 5 April 2017.</p> <p><strong>How much will it cost me?</strong> <br>As little as \u00a3127 and as much as \u00a323,350, depending on how much extra pension you want, up to \u00a325 a week. However, the cost falls as your age increases, so it may make sense to wait until your next birthday before making the payment.</p> <p>Because the deal is the same for males and females, it\u2019s likely to be particularly attractive to women, who typically live longer.</p> <p>As an example, an extra \u00a31 of pension a week (\u00a352 a year) for life will cost a 65-year-old \u00a3890, while an extra \u00a35 a week (\u00a3260 a year) will cost \u00a34,450. To get the maximum extra \u00a325 a week (\u00a31,300 a year) of state pension, someone aged 65 would need to hand over \u00a322,250. For a 75-year-old looking to buy an extra \u00a31, \u00a35 or \u00a325 of pension a week, the lump sum payments required would be a fair bit lower: \u00a3674, \u00a33,370 and \u00a316,850 respectively.</p> <p><strong>How do I find out how much I could get?</strong> <br>A calculator is available online which allows people to input their date of birth and how much they would like to receive, and find out what that would cost them. Go to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-topup\">gov.uk/state-pension-topup</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because the deal is the same for males and females, it\u2019s likely to be attractive to women because they live longer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Is this a good deal?</strong> <br>The longer you live, the better value it represents. In basic terms, someone aged 65 who pays \u00a3890 now to receive an extra \u00a352 a year would need to live for more than 17 years \u2013 beyond 82 \u2013 for the deal to work in their favour. On the face of it, that\u2019s not a bad deal. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average life expectancy for a man currently aged 65 is 86, and for a 65-year-old woman it\u2019s 89; some will reach 100-plus. To find out your life expectancy, go to <a href=\"http://visual.ons.gov.uk/how-long-will-my-pension-need-to-last/\">visual.ons.gov.uk/how-long-will-my-pension-need-to-last/</a></p> <p>One big advantage of this scheme is that it provides an index-linked return \u2013 what you get will increase in line with the consumer price index. Also, in most cases your spouse or civil partner can receive between 50% and 100% of the extra pension after your death.</p> <p><strong>What do the experts think?</strong> <br>Pensions and investment firm Old Mutual Wealth says the rates on offer are \u201cattractive\u201d. It adds that the inflation protection and the fact the top-ups can be inherited means the deal is \u201ccomparable with an index-linked, joint-life annuity available on the private market, but at better rates\u201d. Jon Greer, a pensions expert at the firm, suggests that many of those who bought an annuity during the past few months would have been better-off going down the top-up route.</p> <p><strong>So why the low take-up?</strong> <br>The scheme was unveiled in the December 2013 autumn statement and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/apr/05/state-pension-top-ups-should-you\">received quite a bit of publicity</a>. But data provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in response to a freedom of information request by Old Mutual Wealth shows that just 3,848 people took advantage of the scheme during its first six months. The average amount of extra pension bought was \u00a321 per week at a typical cost of \u00a316,500.</p> <p>Greer says relatively few people seem to be aware of this option, perhaps because of the \u201cconfusing\u201d Class 3A label, or because pensioner bonds and the \u201cpension freedom\u201d reforms grabbed all the headlines last year. The more prosaic answer is that many older people do not have a sizeable lump sum they can use to buy extra state pension. Some may feel that spending hundreds of pounds now to get, say, an extra \u00a31 of pension a week isn\u2019t worth the hassle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/14/uk-younger-generation-pensions-bill-report\">Younger generation in UK face overwhelming pensions bill, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A DWP spokesman says: \u201cWe have been clear that many people stand to benefit from topping up their state pension, and those who do will receive guaranteed payments for life, which in many cases can be inherited by spouses or civil partners. Anyone considering the top-up scheme should consider whether it\u2019s right for their individual circumstances.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Any downsides?</strong> <br>State pension top-up is taxable as income, so check how much you would receive after tax. For some, a product such as an Isa may be a better bet. It may also affect any income-related benefits you receive now or in future. If you have gaps in your national insurance record it may be more cost-effective to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/pay-voluntary-class-3-national-insurance\">make voluntary NI contributions</a> first. Another option is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/deferring-state-pension\">deferring your state pension</a>.</p> <p><strong>How do I make a payment?</strong> <br>You can apply online at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/statepensiontopup\">gov.uk/statepensiontopup</a>, or by phone (0345 600 4270). You will then receive a form explaining how to pay. Once you have coughed up, your higher pension amount will be payable from that date. There is a cooling-off period, so you can get a refund if you change your mind.</p>",

Yet Bakewell is for ever banned from serving as a juror in a court case.</p> <p>Neither can Michael Buerk be called by the Jury Central Summoning Bureau, nor David Starkey, nor Roger Scruton (although Melanie Phillips slips in). Some of the finest intellects in the country are called to debate on the Moral Maze, yet many would not be allowed to sit in a jury box.</p> <p>Why? Because they are all 70 years of age or older. Jury service in England and Wales is limited to those between 18 and 70. It\u2019s an astonishingly ageist rule, and all the more extraordinary in an era of huge improvements in longevity.</p> <p>Are the over-70s too dozy? Will the likes of Michael Buerk nod off during a trial? Are the issues in court cases too complex for minds such as Bakewell\u2019s? Our courts seem to think so.</p> <p>Oddly, there is a widespread belief that juries are disproportionately made up of the elderly who have time on their hands (and a propensity to hang and flog). But that was always nonsense; until the Criminal Justice Act 1988, the upper limit for jury service was only 65.</p> <p>Three years ago the Ministry of Justice proposed that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/aug/20/uk-jury-age-limit-75\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/aug/20/uk-jury-age-limit-75\">age limit be raised to 75,</a> but it has hardly been a serious priority. The latest is that new legislation will be brought forward within the next year, although there is no guarantee.</p> <p>Yet why even have an upper age limit? The new one will mean Buerk (70) is in, but Bakewell (83) remains firmly out. Judi Dench (81) will be deemed not fit for service, but Helen Mirren (71) will be.</p> <p>As Age UK said when the new age limit was proposed: \u201cJudging someone on the basis of their date of birth alone risks overlooking a person\u2019s unique skills and knowledge. While it\u2019s true that increasing longevity brings its challenges, there is also extraordinary human capital within our older population \u2013 older people are working, volunteering and contributing a huge amount to communities and the wider marketplace.\u201d</p> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Consultations/cocj-response-upper-age-limit-jury-service.pdf\" title=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Consultations/cocj-response-upper-age-limit-jury-service.pdf\">Council of HM Circuit Judges examined the issue</a> in 2010 they concluded that the upper age limit for jurors should remain at 70. They acknowledged that improvements in lifestyle and medicine have resulted in many older people enjoying a longer and more active life than their forebears. But they added that older jurors may be \u201cmore susceptible to illness and disability than those who are younger\u201d and that \u201cproceedings might be hampered by poor hearing, poor vision or physical disability\u201d.</p> <p>Yet over the border in Scotland there is no upper age limit; neither is there one in Australia or Ireland. What all those countries do is give older people a right of excusal. In England and Wales we have clamped down harshly on those who try to avoid jury service, yet ignore the huge depth of experience among the over-70s. A simple reform would be to remove the upper age limit on the over-70s, but to give those summoned an automatic right not to attend.</p> <p>After all if we don\u2019t allow the over-70s in, we won\u2019t be reflecting society. One of the ringleaders behind the Hatton Garden heist, Brian Reader, was in his mid-70s at the time and headed a Dad\u2019s Army group of robbers in their 60s and 70s. Given our ageist jury selection rules, it can hardly be said they were tried by a jury of their peers.</p> <p><em>p.collinson@theguardian.com </em></p>",
  "<p>The pound has plummeted to less than 1.15 against the euro and 1.3 against the dollar, the lowest for years. So finding the best foreign exchange provider is more essential than ever. But this article is not about holiday money. It\u2019s about people who need to send small sums regularly, and those making large one-off transfers, such as buying a holiday property. It reveals that some providers are great for large sums, but pricey for smaller transfers \u2013 and it tells you to avoid PayPal, which came out particularly poorly in our price survey.</p> <p>Consumers should first cut through any nonsense about \u201cno fees\u201d or \u201cno commission\u201d. Your key question should be: \u201cAfter all the charges, how many euros/yen/dollars etc will I get for X pounds?\u201d To do this, check how much you are offered against the mid-market \u201cinterbank rate\u201d, the rate used when banks trade between one other. You can check the live interbank rate on <a href=\"http://www.xe.com\">XE.com</a>.</p> <p>Secondly, you can be reasonably certian that the deal offered by your high street bank will be pretty lousy, unless you are a \u201cpremier\u201d type customer transferring very large sums.</p> <p>James Daley of Fairer Finance says: \u201cAlmost all major banks charge a fortune for transferring money overseas, and offer a poor exchange rate to boot. The good news is that a number of alternatives offer you much better value.\u201d</p> <p>Our third golden rule is that, if transferring a sizeable sum into a foreign account, first send a small sum and check it has been received, as much to ensure you have sent it to the right account as anything else. Only then should you send the full amount.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Almost all major banks charge a fortune for transferring money overseas, and offer a poor exchange rate to boot</p> <footer> <cite>James Daley, Fairer Finance</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Finally, remember there is relatively limited protection should things go wrong. The currency brokers can be \u201cauthorised\u201d by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or just \u201cregistered\u201d. Authorised firms should keep clients\u2019 money separate from the company\u2019s own funds. If a firm is just registered with the FCA there\u2019s a risk all the money is in the same pot and could be lost if the company went bust.</p> <p>\u201cEven if a firm is FCA authorised, it\u2019s important to understand that there is no protection from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme in this sector,\u201d says Daley. \u201cSo if a firm goes bust because of a fraud, there\u2019s still a chance that you won\u2019t get your money back. However, the risks if you\u2019re using a big brand are fairly small.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-33112661\">Crown Currency Exchange, based in Hayle, Cornwall, went bust, leaving 3,000 people owed \u00a320m</a>. It used new customers\u2019 cash to pay off existing clients, as well as fund the purchase of a luxury home. Three people involved in the scam have been jailed.</p> <h2><strong>What we found</strong></h2> <p>We obtained quotes for moving \u00a3200, \u00a32,000 and \u00a3150,000 into euros and dollars. We conducted the test on 29 July when the pound was fetching \u20ac1.19 and $1.32 respectively, but sadly it has since fallen further.</p> <p><strong>Best for small sums</strong><em> </em>When transferring \u00a3200 we found UKForex best for euros and TransferWise best for dollars. UKForex is FCA authorised rather than registered, and is a subsidiary of an Australian group, OFX. TransferWise is a peer-to-peer service (see below), headquartered in London and run by Estonians. Investors in the business include Richard Branson.</p> <p>Worst in this bracket were MoneyGram and NatWest, which goes to show why you shouldn\u2019t automatically use well-known names. For \u00a3200, NatWest would give us only $229.31, compared with $260.94 from TransferWise.</p> <p><strong>Best for mid-size sums</strong> When transferring \u00a32,000, the Currency Account (for euros) and TransferWise (dollars) were best. The Currency Account is a relatively new and small company, formed in 2014, and is authorised by the FCA. It describes itself as a \u201chybrid\u201d peer-to-peer plus direct market access company.</p> <p>Worst for mid-size sums were PayPal (euros) and NatWest (dollars).</p> <p><strong>Best for large sums</strong> We checked rates on moving \u00a3150,000, a sum where you would be seriously upset if anything went wrong. Again, the Currency Account came top for euros, though there was very little between it and the other brokers. HiFX came top in the bracket for dollars. HiFX was established in 1998 and is one of the largest brokers, having transferred around \u00a3100bn since then.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"998a36543413ab0ea54b8e0d25f8747a94f64ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/998a36543413ab0ea54b8e0d25f8747a94f64ba2/18_30_1476_692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Currency conversion table\" width=\"1000\" height=\"469\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Providers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Currency brokers </strong>There are loads of currency brokers or money transfer specialists. These include MoneyCorp, Currencies Direct, CaxtonFX, TorFX, HiFX, UKForex, FairFX, Azimo and Xendpay. They pretty much all advertise \u201cbank beating\u201d rates, but how do they compare against one another?</p> <p>A handful of currency comparison sites are available, but they won\u2019t necessarily find the best deal. If you\u2019re looking for the most bang for your buck you would be better off going to individual companies, getting a quote and asking how long the transfer will take. When you see a company offering a good deal, check out its reputation by using FXCompared, TrustPilot or a general Google search.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t send money overseas, so can cut out the crazy fees that banks charge consumers</p> <footer> <cite>Taavet Hinrikus, TransferWise</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Established firms are usually, but not always, the most reliable. Some smaller brokers and \u201cdisruptive\u201d web platforms temporarily stopped trading during the EU referendum aftermath.</p> <p><strong>Peer-to-peer services</strong> TransferWise is one of a new breed of peer-to-peer operators which cut out the banks and brokers by providing an online meeting place for people wanting to buy each other\u2019s currencies. You don\u2019t send your money directly, rather to the currency exchange firm which then passes it on.</p> <p>\u201cOur exchanges are based on free or extremely low-cost local bank account transfers. We don\u2019t send money overseas, so can cut out the crazy fees that banks charge consumers,\u201d says Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of TransferWise.</p> <p>Another peer-to-peer platform, CurrencyFair, works in a similar way, though the exchange rates are set by its users. In the event that there are no customers providing a decent rate for your exchange, CurrencyFair will step in and match with you. The site claims customers typically pay 0.35% of the amount exchanged plus a fixed \u20ac3 transfer fee.</p> <h2><strong>Other options</strong></h2> <p>If you need to pay in cash or transfer money quickly, Western Union and MoneyGram both have branches on the high street \u2013 but their services are not cheap and only suitable for small amounts. And while the companies themselves are legitimate, they are often used by scammers, so be wary of strangers asking for payment this way.</p> <p>PayPal might make it easy to send money overseas, but was the most expensive option in half the Guardian calculations. It whacks on a hefty conversion fee if you want to pay someone in another currency.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 22 August to correct the year in which the Currency Account was set up.

  "<p>I learned to surf in South Devon when I was 14 years old; I\u2019d catch the train from Exeter down to Exmouth or Dawlish. Since then I\u2019ve built my life around surfing. I now live in <a href=\"http://www.croydesurfclub.com\">Croyde</a>, a five-minute walk from the beach, and I can see the sea from my house. The first thing I do when I get up is check the conditions. I surf every day.</p> <p>The feeling when you step off the land into the sea, into an untamed and wild environment, is beautiful. The speed, the power and the G-force as you do huge sweeping and swooping turns off the top of the wave is about as close as you can get to flying. It\u2019s addictive. And the inside of a barrel, looking out at the world framed by water, is a special place to be.</p> <p>Every wave is different, and there are countless waves out there, all over the world, that I want to ride. I\u2019ve travelled a fair bit to expand my experiences, but the quality of the conditions and the waves in Britain is on a par with countries like Australia or Portugal. Some would argue it takes a special type of person to surf in Britain all year round, but it really isn\u2019t that bad. Wetsuit technology has moved on massively. And I\u2019m really lucky: I can be in the sea in winter, and within five minutes I\u2019m in a hot shower.</p> <p>Every surfer the world over has that broad-shouldered physique, and I\u2019ve been told I have it, too. I spent my formative years paddling on the board, so it means I developed a powerful upper body. Everything I do is geared up to prolong my surfing: I don\u2019t drink, I run every other day and I try to eat healthily.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/30/my-workout-coasteering-gary-chilton\">My workout: Gareth Chilton, 25, coasteerer \u2013 \u2018I get a buzz doing scary stuff\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both my sons surf. My eldest (now 15) started surfing at three years old. My youngest is following in his footsteps and surfs more or less every day. I\u2019m 55 and I will still run all the way down to the beach from my house, totally excited about what\u2019s in store. If you look after yourself, age is not an issue.</p> <h2>My weekend workout</h2> <p><strong>Hours surfed a day?</strong> Between one and three<br><strong>Favourite surf spot?</strong> Croyde at low tide<br><strong>Biggest wave?</strong> 15ft, in <a href=\"https://www.simonseeks.com/travel-guides/south-west-france-surfers__113271\">Gu\u00e9thary</a>, south of Biarritz<br><strong>Pre-surf snack?</strong> A banana on my way to the beach<br><strong>Sharks?</strong> Never seen a shark while I\u2019ve been surfing<br></p> <h2>Five ways to get started: surfing<br></h2> <p><strong>1</strong> You can start surfing at any age. It\u2019s thought to be a young person\u2019s sport, but that is not true. There\u2019s nothing stopping anyone of any age giving surfing a go.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Using the wrong equipment can be very frustrating. While a small board is manoeuvrable, as a learner you should always start on a longer board, because it is more stable.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> To catch a wave, position yourself behind the white water. Start paddling as the wave approaches and, just before it breaks, pop up to your feet.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Getting from a prone paddling position, lying on your belly, to standing on the board in one smooth motion takes good core strength. But it\u2019s easier in the sea than on dry land, as you can use the momentum of the water to your advantage.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Pretty much every beach in the country has a <a href=\"http://surfinggb.com/\">Surfing GB</a>-recognised surf school. It\u2019s worth signing up for lessons \u2013 you\u2019ll pick up the basics faster, and learning in a group does a lot for your confidence.</p> <h2>Essential kit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa925bc944aa6ad46c472796906562c509efb75b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa925bc944aa6ad46c472796906562c509efb75b/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Quiksilver AG47 zipperless wetsuit, \u00a3180, quiksilver.co.uk; Fourth Surfboards Mad Fresh board, \u00a3450, store.magicseaweed.com; Dryrobe advance long-sleeve changing robe, \u00a3130, dryrobe.com\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Quiksilver AG47 zipperless wetsuit, \u00a3180, <a href=\"http://www.quiksilver.co.uk/\">quiksilver.co.uk</a>; Fourth Surfboards Mad Fresh board, \u00a3450, <a href=\"https://store.magicseaweed.com/\">store.magicseaweed.com</a>; Dryrobe advance long-sleeve changing robe, \u00a3130, <a href=\"http://dryrobe.com/\">dryrobe.com</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 Do you have a passion for exercise?

  "<p>Two years ago a reader contacted Guardian Money after being summoned for a fourth time to serve on a jury. Now he has been called up again \u2013 and wonders if five trips to the jury box is something of a record.</p> <p>Robert Smith*, 64, says he has enjoyed his previous stints in court and sees it as his civic duty, which he is proud to undertake. But it has left him scratching his head as to why he is called so often.</p> <p>Plenty of people go through their lives never being summoned; others are called repeatedly. Is selection really, as the government says, entirely random, or is something else at work here?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/22/why-our-jury-system-can-be-guilty-of-inflexibility\">Why our jury system can be guilty of inflexibility | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2015 there were 361,300 juror summons issued in England and Wales, but the number who actually sat on a jury was just 179,200. With the two nations having a total population of 57.8 million, it means the chances of serving are relatively slim. The Ministry of Justice declined to give figures on the likelihood of being summoned, but <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-36140259\">a BBC Scotland analysis found that the probability of being asked to serve is just 40%</a> over a lifetime.</p> <p>That makes Smith\u2019s five summons very rare. The MoJ says that if you are called within two years of the last time you served you have an automatic right to be excused. Smith\u2019s latest summons is almost exactly two years after his last.</p> <p>Numerous theories abound on the internet as to why some people are called to serve and others not. Some believe they are blacklisted because they have an Irish heritage (dating back to IRA terrorism days), or that they were once a member of CND. Others believe a letter to the courts suggesting you are a \u201changer and flogger\u201d will get you off the hook. Some reckon they have been picked because they have been at the same address or same job for years on end and are a conservative, reliable type.</p> <p>The reality is rather more dull. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service\">Jury Central Summoning Bureau</a> (JCSB) randomly chooses names from the electoral register. It is under no requirement to call people who are a representative cross-section of society \u2013 which is why, in theory, it is possible to have juries which are entirely male or female. According to the MoJ, no attempt is made to balance gender, age or ethnicity. It is as random as the prize number generator for premium bonds. Some people hold premium bonds all their life and win nothing, others win again and again.</p> <p>Smith says those summoned should prize the experience. \u201cI found it really interesting. Some days it can be immensely frustrating, other days rather boring, and sometimes it\u2019s very harrowing. I see it as a citizenship thing \u2013 that is, a duty for those called \u2013 and should be a source of pride. Sometimes it can make you doubt your fellow citizens, but equally I\u2019ve been with 12 men and women good and true, and they have been an absolute pleasure to work with.\u201d</p> <p>Smith acknowledges that he has been 23 years at the same address, but he adds that his first summons was at an earlier address in another London borough. It means he has seen the inside of more crown courts than most career criminals.</p> <p>Ironically, before Smith became semi-retired he worked in HR, and would regularly write letters to the courts asking for an employee to be excused from jury service. \u201cI worked in a big bank, and some staff were under huge pressure. Often it wasn\u2019t them but their managers who would insist that they could not spare the two weeks out of the office.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the 1980s and 1990s such letters worked, but today the courts are less keen to excuse people. \u201cThey gradually got much tougher about it because everyone was doing it. You can understand why \u2013 I think the problem was that juries started to be largely made up of retired people and the unemployed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes it can make you doubt your fellow citizens, but equally I\u2019ve been with 12 men and women good and true</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Actually, the figures for excusals remain relatively high: of the 361,300 summons in 2015, 27% were excused \u2013 up one percentage point on the year earlier.</p> <p>Some people are automatically excluded from a summons. You\u2019re not wanted if you\u2019re over 70 or under 18. Neither can you serve if you have been in prison in the past 10 years. But other than that, you\u2019ll need a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228867/9780108508400.pdf\">\u201cgood reason\u201d</a> why you are unavailable for the next 12 months, otherwise you will simply be deferred and called again at a later date.</p> <p>Grounds for excusal include:</p> <p>\u2022 You can\u2019t speak or understand English</p> <p>\u2022 You have responsibilities as a carer</p> <p>\u2022 Your excusal would cause \u201cunusual hardship\u201d for your business</p> <p>\u2022 You are a member of the armed forces and your absence would be prejudicial to the efficiency of the service</p> <p>Most other excuses are treated as reasons to defer, not to avoid, jury service. It used to be the case that \u201cofficials\u201d such as police officers, MPs and judges could gain automatic excusal, but those days are gone \u2013 police officers who know a particular court well are simply sent to be jurors at other courts outside their working area, while MPs are allowed to avoid jury service in their constituency but will be expected to attend elsewhere. You can even find yourself on a jury sitting next to a judge. They are only excused if they are known to parties involved in the trial. Other than that, they have to turn up, too.</p> <p>Much more commonly, you can delay jury service but only once, and you have to say when you will be available over the next 12 months.</p> <p>The main grounds for deferral are:</p> <p>\u2022 You have a holiday booked</p> <p>\u2022 You are having an operation</p> <p>\u2022 You are a teacher and it is exam time</p> <p>\u2022 You are a taking a temporary job (eg a university student during summer) that you\u2019d lose if forced to attend court</p> <p>The most common complaints about jury service come from young mothers and the self-employed. Mumsnet forums are alive with complaints from mothers with pre-school children. \u201cThe accompanying bumf says they pay \u00a332.47 per day for any childcare costs incurred \u2026 round here that would just about pay for three hours\u2019 worth of babysitting,\u201d says one, while another says, \u201cI just completed eight days of jury service (in Scotland) and, despite having three pre-schoolers, I was not excused.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7d4dda7ffae8d46212dba062f1a3ce0ee978b74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7d4dda7ffae8d46212dba062f1a3ce0ee978b74/0_6_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Good Wife\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t expect an episode of The Good Wife, with jurors challenged by fancy lawyers.

The figure rises to \u00a364.95 for more than four hours a day, then goes up the longer the case lasts. The courts will also pay \u00a35.71 a day for food and drink.</p> <p>Many self-employed argue that \u00a364.95 is hardly enough to cover their losses and, what\u2019s more, the person has to provide evidence of loss of earnings before the sum is paid out. Last year, research by Churchill Home Insurance found that one in 20 employers refused to pay their staff if they undertook jury service, while a third stopped after five days. There is no legal obligation for firms to pay employees while on jury service.</p> <p>Boredom is perhaps a bigger issue for many who are called up. Much of the time a juror spends in crown court is in a room waiting to be called. The MoJ is trying to tackle this, saying its \u201cjuror utilisation rate\u201d has rise by 12% since 2006 to around 71%. But that still means a lot of people spending a lot of time twiddling their thumbs.</p> <p>Typically, jurors are required to be available for 10 days, but sometimes longer. The MoJ says: \u201cThe court will always call more people than may be needed to ensure they have enough people when the juries are being picked. Most jurors are called for approximately 10 working days. During this time you could sit on a number of juries covering a wide range of trials; however this cannot be guaranteed.\u201d</p> <p>If you are called for a trial, 15 of you will be led into the court room, with 12 eventually selected. But don\u2019t expect an episode of The Good Wife, with jurors challenged by fancy lawyers. In Britain, the court clerk will select 12 out of the 15 potential jurors at random to sit on the jury. Only then will you find out if you are on a fascinating trial or something rather more dull. And don\u2019t ever think about skipping service \u2013 a juror in Leeds who failed to turn up at court, saying \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered, it\u2019s really boring\u201d, was <a href=\"http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/bored-jurer-halted-sex-trial-1-4261878\">arrested for contempt of court</a>, while another was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/sep/26/4\">fined \u00a3100 for filing her nails</a> and reading a magazine while hearing a case.

And you\u2019ll have competition from companies around the world that often buy the goods for resale. On Wednesday, for example, with one day left in the three-day auction period, there were 14 bids-with $5,136 the highest shown-for a lot of 4,000 of those chairs valued at $76,000. (That top bid would mean $1.28 per chair.) </p> <p>Rio is the sixth Olympic Games for which RGS Events, a family-owned company in Melbourne, Australia, has provided and disposed of fixtures, furniture, and equipment, starting with Sydney in 2000. This year it\u2019s partnering with U.S. online liquidator B-Stock Solutions to get rid of some of the goods. </p> <p>The majority of buyers who\u2019ve bid on the site to \u201cBuy a Piece of the Rio 2016 Olympics\u201d have been from the U.S., but sales have also been made to buyers in Australia, Canada, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and the United Kingdom, said Howard Rosenberg, B-Stock\u2019s chief executive. </p> <p>Many products used for those 17 highly televised days eventually go to party-rental companies, furniture resellers, schools, janitorial companies, and event-planning outfits-plus \u201cscrappy entrepreneurial types\u201d who go out and make a market for the items, said Rosenberg. He said \u201chundreds of 40-foot containers of stuff\u201d have been sold. </p> <p>Paul Ramler, chief executive of RGS Events, said more than 90 percent of the 1.3 million or so items from Rio have been spoken for. Some of the products wind up at other major sporting events. Many from the 2012 London Olympics, for instance, spent 16 months stored in 400 40-foot containers at the port in Grangemouth, Scotland, before being used in the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, said Ramler. </p> <p>After Glasgow, some of those products took part in the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England. Then, RGS donated more than 2 million British pounds worth of well-traveled sofas, wardrobes, bean bags, and more to needy families in Glasgow. Some of the Rio furniture could be used for other sports events in South America, Ramler said; the company is in talks with the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics. </p> <p>Some products will go to a large Brazilian office furniture retailer, Shopping Matriz. Ideally, some of that inventory would have been used in another event RGS is working on, the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in Australia, but storage for two years cost too much to make that feasible, Ramler added.

The Londoner continued pushing after his opponent in the second, enjoying more success, but still leaving himself worryingly open to accurate counters. </p> <p>As the round progressed, he began to land much cleaner and heavier blows, and Dychko, blowing heavily, began to appear increasingly vulnerable. The judges agreed, making the last round effectively a decider, and Joyce pushed forward hurling big right uppercuts as the Kazakh attempted vainly to cling on. </p> <p>Joyce\u2019s fitness was really beginning to tell, bouncing in to deliver further punishment in sharp contrast to Dychko, whose work was increasingly laboured. A left hand swatted the Kazakh\u2019s chin as Joyce finished things off in dominant style to earn the verdict on all three cards. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b752efe4b0b7e64900138f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T18:42:11.226Z\">7.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s Owen Gibson\u2019s story on the Paralympics\u2019 downsizing:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/rio-paralympics-downsized-disappointing-ticket-sales\">Rio Paralympics to be downsized amid disappointing ticket sales</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b751fce4b047b85f601baa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T18:38:52.694Z\">7.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Joyce is through to the gold medal bout, the judges decide unanimously.

There is plenty of Dr Wu within its 104 pages, including at least 25 photos of the great man, and this undertaking: \u201cAt AIBA, we have taken great steps to ensure that this year\u2019s Olympic boxing competition is as fair, entertaining and inspiring as it possibly can be.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been entertaining, all right, but not probably as Dr Wu intended.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b7462be4b047b85f601b8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T17:47:32.468Z\">6.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There will be three minutes of stoppage time at the end of the women\u2019s football bronze medal match.

Grrrr! Speaking of whom, I am one of three journalists in the press box. </p> <p>Following yesterday\u2019s ranking round, the competitors are having quite an interesting eliminator: last yesterday takes on second last and it\u2019s winner stays on until they get to the yesterday\u2019s top swordswoman. It allows those who did badly yesterday to try to get a few more points. All the events \u2013 the swimming, the fencing, the showjumping (on horses the competitors don\u2019t know) \u2013 lead up the final discipline: running and shooting. Those higher ranked on the leaderboard after the horse-riding gets a head start before embarking on the final test and whoever crosses the finish line first wins.

  "<h2>Snapshot: The sister whom I grew to love \u2013 and lost</h2> <p>Summer in London, 1967. I love this photo. That\u2019s me in the middle, with my hands above my head surrounded by cousins and siblings. I love the contrast between the six of us and my very still, formal, older sister Cate. We six are all exhibiting characteristics of our future selves. My sister looks like she is not really a part of the photo, as she edges away from the wall.</p> <p>She was to die from a stroke 14 years later, at the age of 25. In this photograph it looks like she is already leaving. We didn\u2019t really get on until she left home, and then I became fiercely devoted to her. She had her first stroke at 21. It didn\u2019t stop her. She skied, travelled, graduated, loved, worked with mental health patients and made beautiful pottery, all without the full use of her right arm and leg. She didn\u2019t survive the second stroke.</p> <p>Her legacy is powerful. Live life to the absolute maximum and take risks. I do.</p> <p><em>Liz Wilson</em></p> <h2>Playlist: Sound effects, silly voices and laughter</h2> <p><strong>That Old Black Magic by Spike Jones</strong></p> <p>\u201c<em>That old black magic has me in its spell / That old black magic that you weave so well / Those icy fingers up and down my spine / The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine\u201d</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5KYW441M4g\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J5KYW441M4g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>When I was growing up in the 1950s, we had a large collection of 78rpm records. If you wanted to listen to a Beethoven symphony you needed at least 10 separate records and had to keep changing them on the turntable. Amazing to think that was how we listened to classical music in those days. But my favourites were the songs by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122018506\">Spike Jones and his City Slickers</a>. Jones was a band leader with an anarchic sense of humour; think Mad magazine. He has been credited with influencing the Goons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/30/frank-zappa-70th-birthday-roundhouse\">Frank Zappa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/nov/29/old-music-bozo-dog-intro-outro\">the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band</a>, among others.</p> <p>My dad, an exact contemporary of Jones, was a semi-professional drummer in the 1930s, knew a thing or two about music, and always impressed on me what good musicians the members of the band were, even though, at times, it sounded like they couldn\u2019t play the right notes! This, of course, was deliberate. They put their own spin on such classics as That Old Black Magic, The Blue Danube, William Tell Overture, Flight of the Bumble Bee, and I\u2019m in the Mood for Love. What made the songs so different was the liberal use of gunshots, whistles, cowbells, shouts, laughing, outlandish vocals and other sound effects. For example, at the end of the line that goes \u201conly your kiss can put out the fire\u201d you hear a fire engine bell, or at the end of \u201cevery time your lips meet mine\u201d there\u2019s a loud, smacking-lips sound. They made us laugh.</p> <p>Fast forward to 1974. I was 26 and living in Stuttgart (it\u2019s a long story). My mum and dad were both 64. I was about to move back to England, and they came in the car to take me and my stuff home. Included was a double LP of Spike Jones and his City Slickers that I had bought in Germany. \u201c<em>Ein seltsamer Sinn fur Ordnung herrsicht in all diesem Chaos</em>\u201d! (I still have it, as well as five CDs.) My parents were staying the night in my room. I shared a flat with two other English friends and it was to introduce them to Spike\u2019s music that I bought the record. Not sure they liked him as much as I did though.</p> <p>After we had eaten, I played it to my mum and dad. I don\u2019t think either of them had listened to him for years. First they smiled. Then they chuckled. Then they started laughing, and couldn\u2019t stop. They were both sitting on the edge of my bed in hysterics. When one song finished there was just enough time to take breath before it all started over again. The sound of a silly voice, a gunshot, a shriek. They were laughing so much they were in pain. Tears were rolling down their cheeks. I don\u2019t think I had ever seen my parents in such a state before. Not together. Not laughing at the same thing. Not being totally out of control.</p> <p>My father died in 1984. My mother in 1996. When I think about them that evening, in my room, with Spike Jones, it brings tears to my eyes.</p> <p><em>Walt Lenini</em></p> <h2>We love to eat: My grandmother\u2019s Egyptian shakshuka </h2> <p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br><em>2 tins of </em>Ful medames<em> (fava beans) to be found at Middle Eastern grocers</em><br><em>2 large onions</em><br><em>Oil (sunflower)</em><br><em>One large tin of chopped tomatoes</em><br><em>Two large cloves of garlic, thinly sliced</em><br><em>One tbspn of chopped parsley (flat)</em><br><em>One tspn of mixed spices</em><br><em>One tspn of ground cumin</em><br><em>Salt and pepper to taste</em><br><em>One large egg per person</em></p> <p>Peel and slice the onions.

It keeps them going all throughout the day and they need to eat nothing until dinner.</p> <p>Shakshuka is a more sophisticated version and it is prepared on special occasions. My grandmother took a special pride in preparing it for Easter Monday. She never used tinned <em>ful</em>, instead she cooked her own fava beans with plenty of water and a tablespoon of red lentils that gave her beans that very special reddish colour. Cooked very slowly all night long on a small alcohol burner until morning, it was ready. </p> <p>By serving the Shakshuka at that time, my grandmother was combining Egyptian conventional breakfast with the customary Easter eggs tradition. We ate it with the local <em>baladi</em> brown bread, dipping it in the sauce and breaking the egg yolk.</p> <p>I still continue the tradition and organise a brunch for friends and relatives. My personal version is very similar, with the exception that I dish out the sauce in individual oven-proof dishes, so that every guest has their own shakshuka. I serve it with warm brown pitta bread and a large bowl of rocket leaves and spring onions. As it stands, the dish does not need any extra flavours, yet I have a friend who adds a few drops of chilli sauce.</p> <p><em>Eva Dadrian</em></p> <h2>We\u2019d love to hear your stories<br></h2> <p>We will pay \u00a325 for every Letter to, Playlist, Snapshot or We Love to Eat we publish.

  "<p>Unemployment would rocket. Tumbleweed would billow through deserted high streets. Share prices would crash. The government would struggle to find buyers for UK bonds. Financial markets would be in meltdown. Britain would be plunged instantly into another deep recession.</p> <p>Remember all that? It was hard to avoid the doom and gloom, not just in the weeks leading up to the referendum, but in those immediately after it. Many of those who voted remain comforted themselves with the certain knowledge that those who had voted for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> would suffer a bad case of buyer\u2019s&#xa0;remorse.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t worked out that way.

Retailers are licking their lips in anticipation of an Olympics feelgood factor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-brexit-french-unemployment-business-live\">Pound jumps after UK retail sales defy Brexit fears \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The financial markets are serene. Share prices are close to a record high, and fears that companies would find it difficult and expensive to borrow have proved wide of the mark. Far from dumping UK government gilts, pension funds and insurance companies have been keen to hold on to them.</p> <p>City economists had predicted an immediate rise in the claimant count measure of unemployment in July. That hasn\u2019t happened either. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\" title=\"\">This week\u2019s figures</a> show that instead of a 9,000 rise, there was an 8,600 drop.</p> <p>Some caveats are in order. It is still early days. Hard data is scant. Survey evidence is still consistent with a slowdown in the economy in the second half of 2016. Brexit may be a slow burn, with the impact only becoming apparent in the months and years to come.</p> <p>But it is obvious that the sky has not fallen in as a result of the referendum, and those who said it would look a bit silly. By now, Britain was supposed to be reeling from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/osborne-predicts-30bn-hole-in-public-finance-if-uk-votes-to-leave-eu\" title=\"\">emergency budget</a> George Osborne said would be necessary to fill a \u00a330bn black hole in the public finances caused by a plunging economy. The emergency budget is history, as is Osborne.</p> <p>In a way, Project Fear did work. It put the wind up businesses, making them warier about investing in new kit. And at least some of the people who voted remain did so because they were worried about the economic consequences of leaving. That was hardly surprising, given the regular and lurid warnings \u2013 from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/05/brexit-forecasters-miss-everything-that-matters-to-real-voters\" title=\"\">Treasury, the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> \u2013 about the dire consequences that would inevitably flow from Brexit.</p> <p>The British state did an abrupt U-turn on 24 June. Having failed to secure a yes vote, the official position had to change fast. The imperative was to get all those people who had been frightened witless to chill out. Some surveys since the Brexit vote did indeed pick up an abrupt drop in consumer confidence. The government feared a recession of its own making.</p> <p>So instead of telling the public how hard life was going to be outside the EU, ministers and officials sought to reassure, to administer large doses of soothing balm, to insist that the UK could cope just fine on its own.</p> <p>The economy would certainly have had a tough time had the Treasury and the Bank of England done nothing in the wake of the referendum, but that was never going to happen. There was no passive acceptance of the result: it was an all-action approach. Before his defenestration by Theresa May, Osborne <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/01/george-osborne-scraps-2020-budget-surplus-plan\" title=\"\">ditched his plan to run a budget surplus</a> by the end of the parliament, while his successor Philip Hammond has said he might \u201creset\u201d fiscal policy in the autumn statement. There will now be a more measured \u2013 and sensible \u2013 approach to reducing the budget deficit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/philip-hammond-treasury-to-guarantee-post-brexit-funding-for-eu-backed-projects\">Treasury to guarantee post-Brexit funding for EU-backed projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been sweet-talking the City, making it clear that the banks could have access to unlimited quantities of cheap cash. Interest rates, which stood at 0.5% for more than seven years, have been cut to 0.25%, with a strong hint they will be cut again during the autumn.</p> <p>Project Everything\u2019s OK has worked well so far. Again, this is understandable. There were millions who thought Project Fear was well over the top, which it was, or didn\u2019t think life could become much tougher. The remain camp was ill-advised to rely so heavily on its warnings of economic Armageddon, when only two regions of the country \u2013 London and the south-east \u2013 had seen GDP per head rise above the level before the 2008-9 recession. After weighing up the pros and cons, plenty of voters didn\u2019t think they were risking all that much.</p> <p>As far as it is possible to tell, there was a collective sharp intake of breath in the aftermath of the vote, but then consumers carried on regardless. The latest monthly health-check of household sentiment found a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/public-confidence-in-uk-economy-recovers-after-brexit-vote-survey-finds\" title=\"\">sharp drop in optimism</a> in July followed by a rapid recovery in August. John Lewis and Next \u2013 two bellwethers of activity in the high street \u2013 say trading has not been affected by Brexit.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean everything is fine. Britain has deep structural economic problems that would have to be addressed inside or outside the EU. Investment has been weak, productivity has flatlined since the recession, earnings growth is running at half its 4-5% pre-financial crisis level and, except in times of war, the balance of payments deficit has never been higher.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Brexit has forced the government to take a long, hard look at the British economy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brexit could make some of these challenges more acute. Investment is likely to remain subdued, while the fall in value of the pound since the referendum will push up inflation by making&#xa0;imports more expensive. That will put the squeeze on consumer spending power.</p> <p>But in other respects, Brexit has been a help. It has forced the government to take a long, hard look at the British economy \u2013 something that would not have happened without the shock administered by the referendum. It\u2019s brought home the fact that most of Britain feels disconnected from the economic story peddled by successive&#xa0;governments.</p> <p>For decades, there\u2019s been a tendency for businesses to meet rising demand by employing cheap labour rather than by investing in modern equipment. Large chunks of the economy are characterised by low skills, low wages, and low productivity. As the Resolution Foundation noted this week, companies that rely on the ability to import low-cost employees from the EU are going to have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/brexit-damage-to-uk-economy-will-outweigh-wage-gains-study-finds\" title=\"\">rethink their business models</a>. This is not necessarily a bad thing.</p> <p>The government has responded to Brexit by soft-pedalling on austerity, by contemplating spending more on infrastructure and by committing itself to an industrial strategy. A degree of scepticism is warranted here. The referendum has made change possible: it doesn\u2019t guarantee it will happen. It remains to be seen how many new roads and railways get built, or whether the industrial strategy amounts to anything more than a new name for Whitehall\u2019s business department.</p> <p>When I voted for Brexit on 23 June, I did so for three reasons: because the European Union is a failed project; because Europe is moving in an increasingly free-market direction; and because I wanted to shake up the status quo. It would take an extremely deep and prolonged recession to make me regret my choice. That prospect seems even more remote than it did eight weeks ago.</p>",
  "<p>It was a beautiful day for a wedding. After much heartache, the decision had been made that Oliver and I would have a blessing ceremony for our nuptials in France. Altogether, 180 family members and friends had travelled over to celebrate with us. We had asked a family friend, Humphrey \u2013 a retired Anglican bishop \u2013 to officiate. He had created a special service for us. There was no mention of religion; instead, love, happiness and the&#xa0;future.</p> <p>Just before the ceremony was due to start, I was having a quiet moment. I was dressed, makeup done, ready to go. The sun shone through the windows and my best friend and I were having a laugh about something. An usher came in.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s ready,\u201d he said. I got up to go but the look on his face told me something was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s fine. But the groom\u2019s family aren\u2019t here.\u201d</p> <p>I sat back down and waited. An hour passed and there was still no sign of them. I thought about the angst we had all been through to get here. The tears, frustration and arguments. The fact that Oliver was Jewish and I wasn\u2019t had derailed our relationship more than once. But by now, his family had accepted me. Or so I thought.</p> <p>As the sun sank beneath the windows, I thought back to how&#xa0;Oliver and I had got to this&#xa0;point.</p> <p>We met in Sydney, Australia. I knew instantly he was the one. He mentioned he was Jewish. He told me about his mother\u2019s chicken soup and how it was healing. And he told me how every week, his family would gather together for Friday night dinners, but that was it. I didn\u2019t think about it again. And then real life hit. We went back home to London, where we were both on a mission to find jobs. To grow up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He looked at me and said: 'I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s too difficult'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first hint of trouble came a few months later. Oliver had told me that his brother was getting married.</p> <p>\u201cPlease come and be my date,\u201d he said. I was thrilled. We had taken the next step in our relationship. I thought about what to wear and I wondered what his parents would make of me.</p> <p>Then there was no more mention of it. Oliver seemed like he was hiding something from me. He was edgy, reluctant to talk. I put it down to starting a new job. Two weeks until the big day and I wondered whether I should at least book a ticket to Glasgow, where the marriage was taking place. I asked Oliver. He looked&#xa0;at me and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s too difficult.\u201d</p> <p>In hindsight, I should have known he was trying to tell me something on a deeper level and that I should have pushed. But in typical me fashion, I didn\u2019t ask again. I just assumed the worst and waited for the inevitable \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d conversation. But that didn\u2019t happen. The wedding came and went and we grew closer than ever. So close, in fact, that I was forced to ask Oliver outright why I hadn\u2019t yet met his family. After all, he\u2019d spent a lot of time with mine. He looked at me and said three words that would nearly break us both: \u201cYou\u2019re not Jewish.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t reply for a while. A few days, in fact. I was unable to rationalise it and wished that the channels of communication had opened earlier so that it wasn\u2019t such a shock and I could have put it all in context. As it was, although his family hadn\u2019t met me, I took it personally. I felt isolated, hurt, angry and indignant. And it got worse. Much worse.</p> <p>I was eventually to meet his family, not by their choice. Oliver\u2019s nephew was getting circumcised. A brit milah. I had been invited by his brother and sister-in-law, who accepted me with open arms off the bat. Every other member of his close family would also be attending.</p> <p>I arrived at where the circumcision was taking place. I was shocked to find the ladies were separated from the men. Everyone chatted around tea and cake, waiting for the scream that would let us all know that the cutting of the foreskin had taken place. For that hour or so, not a soul spoke to me in that room, asides from Oliver\u2019s sister-in-law, who welcomed me, despite having other things on her mind. With everyone else, I tried. Having foolishly thought I could win everyone over with grace and charm, I made an effort to introduce myself to all the women. It didn\u2019t work. More than one person turned their back on me that day with a look that said: \u201cDon\u2019t try and talk to us again.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver explained their fears to me: \u201cIf they accept you,\u201d he told me, \u201cit\u2019s giving the go-ahead for their children to marry out.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Oliver told me his parents were being pressurised not to accept me by other members of his family</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A year or so later, I met Oliver\u2019s parents for supper. The atmosphere was chilly. But when they realised I wasn\u2019t going anywhere, it led to a Friday night dinner invite. I went. It was a truly lovely evening. Olly\u2019s mother and father both warmed to me and I to them. They explained their traditions. Oliver\u2019s mother blessed the Friday night challah and the candles, moving her hands around the candles. She didn\u2019t seem to notice I thought she was trying to snuff them out, blowing at them frantically in a bid to help. They gave me warming, sweet-tasting chicken soup, roast chicken, freshly baked bread and a delicious pudding.</p> <p>Oliver told me his parents were being pressurised not to accept me by other members of his family, but very slowly, they welcomed me into their home. I thought that was courageous, given their previous stance, and that of&#xa0;their relatives.</p> <p>Soon after, I got a job as a writer in Jordan. It was 2005 and three hotels had just been bombed in Amman, killing nearly 60 people and injuring more than 100. Olly\u2019s parents forbade him to come and visit me, thinking it was too dangerous for him as a Jew, but he booked his ticket. \u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he told his parents. Nobody could stop&#xa0;him.</p> <p>When I came home from Jordan, the huge and painful divide between his family\u2019s feelings towards me continued. Olly\u2019s grandfather pulled me aside on one occasion: \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he hugged me. \u201cThis religious stuff. It\u2019s all a load of crap.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed but then when Oliver proposed, things didn\u2019t seem so funny. I was never the type of person who had dreamed of her wedding. But when it came to organising the big day, no one could agree on how to do it. My father wanted a traditional Christian wedding in a chapel. Olly\u2019s parents were against this idea. There was talk of me converting. I said an outright no. What was meant to be a special day turned into something fraught. There was screaming, hurtful accusations and tears. In the middle of it all were escalating rows between me and Oliver.</p> <p>Eventually, my father made a lovely suggestion \u2013 to have both a priest and a rabbi to conduct the service. He wrote to the chief rabbi to ask him how to deal with this. He got a reply soon after from the his office. It went along the lines of, \u201cYou should understand how very disappointed Oliver\u2019s parents would be.\u201d</p> <p>Although the reply didn\u2019t help us, I knew the rabbi\u2019s office had to uphold their religious ideals. But this was when things really kicked off. Oliver and I reluctantly decided to call off the wedding. It wasn\u2019t going to work. After some time apart, Oliver appeared at my&#xa0;front door.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the same side,\u201d he told me. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd33e782a9d6adad0dec3d4d45c0b6dc53f94f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd33e782a9d6adad0dec3d4d45c0b6dc53f94f1/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oli and Rebecca on their wedding day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver and Rebecca on their wedding day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We discussed everything, alone. He reassured me that none of it mattered, and with or without his family\u2019s blessing, we would grow old together.</p> <p>We finally agreed to remove the stress of the wedding ceremony out of our home town and all its associations, and marry in France.</p> <p>So there I was, a year later, in a beautiful wedding dress, wondering if the groom\u2019s family would turn up. I looked out of the window and saw Oliver. He was walking up and down the front courtyard, looking upset. I sat and wondered how I was going to tell everyone the celebrations were off.</p> <p>Then I saw a large car, driving through the gates. They had arrived. Oliver was stabbing at his watch and holding up his hands towards his parents. I could see someone gesture towards the bus. As far as I could gather, it hadn\u2019t arrived to collect them from their hotel.</p> <p>A couple of hours later than planned, Oliver and I were married. Now my in-laws are the best I could ask for: supportive and kind. They have risen above their fear and accepted me for who I am. Despite a residual awareness that I\u2019m not Jewish, the two constants have been love and loyalty. The rest of Oliver\u2019s family have also, I believe, accepted me and are wonderfully welcoming.</p> <p>My mother-in-law told me recently how much pressure she was under, given how her family was brought up \u2013 as traditional Jews. \u201cBut life has changed,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re in the 21st century now. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p> <p>Olly and I have two sons. If they ever&#xa0;marry, I shall tell them this: people talk about marrying in, marrying out. Don\u2019t listen to them, please. Just this \u2013 marry forward.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Rebecca Thornton is the author of </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/exclusives.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>The Exclusives</em></a><em>, published by Twenty7, \u00a37.99</em></p>",
  "<p>Several days into my Greek holiday, I am beginning to feel eerily relaxed. This is partly because our children aren\u2019t with us \u2013 I can\u2019t get used to the fact that when a restaurant lunch comes to \u20ac20 a head, I owe only \u20ac40 \u2013 but also because they aren\u2019t at home, either: two of them are on their own separate travels abroad, so the house is comparatively safe.</p> <p>This state of affairs leaves me with a lot of spare psychic space.

It\u2019s not just a holiday thing \u2013 I\u2019ve been hating Donald Trump for years \u2013 but in my present untroubled state, it has become an obsession.

Just before dawn, I get up and sit by the pool with my phone, but nothing is happening. I spend the morning waiting for Donald Trump to wake up and say stupid things. I look up sarcasm online, so I can be certain I know what it means. After lunch, exhausted, I fall asleep with a book on my face, not rising until the cocktail hour. \u201cI\u2019m so relaxed,\u201d I say. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s Wednesday already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Thursday,\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cIs it?\u201d I say. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p> <p>Later that evening, the middle one texts to say that he\u2019s run out of money in Amsterdam, fully four days before his scheduled return.

  "<p>Moments after Saiful Islam opens the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://rigb.org/christmas-lectures\">Royal Institution Christmas Lectures</a> in London this year the theatre will plunge into darkness. Deprived of mains power, and left holding a solitary candle, the scientist must find energy from elsewhere. Without it, the show cannot go on.</p> <p>Even as a stunt, the prospect of a catastrophic lighting failure in a televised lecture is unnerving. But as an expert in materials that store and convert energy from one form to another, Islam is better placed than most to handle the incident. How he will do it, and whether he will succeed, is not yet clear. \u201cWhat I haven\u2019t worked out is how much power the lecture theatre requires,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>For now, Islam has other matters on his mind. Britain\u2019s most prestigious public science lectures have a long and revered history. Since 1825, the greats of the pursuit, from Michael Faraday and Carl Sagan to Sir David Attenborough and Richard Dawkins have presented the demonstration-filled sessions. \u201cI feel very privileged, very honoured, and partly terrified to follow in their footsteps,\u201d Islam says in his first interview on the lectures. \u201cHopefully my nervous energy will carry me through.\u201d<br></p> <p>He was initially reluctant to take the job. The professor of materials chemistry at Bath University was so wrapped up in his research that he turned down the opportunity to host the lectures. He changed his mind after a little persuasion. One colleague warned that should he decline, he would regret the decision for the rest of his life.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The wakeup call worked. A \u201cdevout atheist\u201d, humanist, and Smiths fan, Islam says he is now \u201craring to go\u201d and deeply focused on the three-part series, \u201cSupercharged: Fuelling the Future\u201d, which will be broadcast on BBC4 over the Christmas period. During the 4series, he will explore the invisible energy that drives everything from our bodies, cars and mobile devices, to all the stars in the universe. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The RI Christmas lectures were first televised 80 years ago, an anniversary Islam will mark by revisiting historic experiments performed at the institution, including Faraday\u2019s seminal breakthrough on electricity generation in the building\u2019s basement. To recreate classic demos on the theme of energy, chosen to honour Faraday\u2019s life and work, Islam will be joined by the presenters of Christmas lectures past.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cPeople take energy for granted. It is all around us from the moment we are born and we assume it will be with us for all time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd one thing about energy is that it cannot be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another. So the candle is a nice example of chemical energy leading to light and heat energy.\u201d<br></p> <p>Islam describes himself as a chemist without a white lab coat. Instead of mixing brews of dubious content, he uses computer modelling to study materials for batteries and renewable energy sources at the level of the atom. When asked at parties about his line of work, it is a mouthful, which he distills to simply: \u201cI model.\u201d<br></p> <p>He was not one of those children who owned a chemistry kit, or who was led into science by an inspirational teacher. But his father, a first-generation immigrant, was keen for Saiful and his two younger sisters to do well. Though encouraged into medicine, Islam veered towards science simply because he was good at it. A chemistry degree led to a PhD and a stint at Eastman Kodak in New York, before he returned to a research post in Britain. \u201cI\u2019m glad I resisted my parents\u2019 push,\u201d he says. \u201cMedicine is a good route out of poverty, but I loved chemistry more.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Islam\u2019s first memory of the RI Christmas lectures was <a href=\"http://richannel.org/christmas-lectures/1977/1977-carl-sagan\">Carl Sagan</a>, who in 1977 spoke about the planets and life elsewhere to an audience resplendent in chunky knits and large collars. \u201cI got this sense that scientific knowledge was important, that gathering knowledge about the world around us was key,\u201d Islam says. \u201cHe was so passionate about the subject.\u201d<br></p> <p>In his own lecture series, Islam will explore how materials are central to solving the world\u2019s rising demand for energy. With fossil fuels unsustainable, what can solar and other renewables do? And what role will batteries play in the future? How can phones last for a week, and cars run for hundreds of miles, on a single charge?<br></p> <p>As a British Asian growing up in 1970s London, Islam witnessed discrimination. He sits on the Royal Society\u2019s diversity committee, which aims to gather data and then understand why women and ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that if you want good science and innovation, you must exploit the talents of all, regardless of gender, race and background,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m a role model, but I\u2019d be very happy if I did encourage younger generations from diverse backgrounds to stay in science.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Despite Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, which Islam says has cast doubt over science funding, collaborations and the future for thousands of European researchers in the UK, he remains an optimist. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic time to be a scientist,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are really great opportunities to make contributions to scientific advances, whether that is in energy, nanotechnology, disease or space exploration.<br></p> <p>\u201cScience can be tricky and hard, but there are rewards,\u201d he adds. \u201cI want children to understand that the pursuit of science is the proper way to unravel the mysteries of the world around us and that it is full of beauty and exciting discovery.\u201d</p>"
