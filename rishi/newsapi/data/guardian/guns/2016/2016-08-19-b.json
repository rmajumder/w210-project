  "<p>New South Wales has claimed success in reforms designed to stop real estate agents from underquoting as Victoria embarks on similar legal changes in an attempt to crack down on the practice.</p> <p> NSW Fair Trading says complaints about underquoting have been in steady decline since the commencement of the reforms at the beginning of 2016. </p> <p>The changes mean that agents can no longer give understated or vague property prices \u2013 for example, by using phrases like \u201coffers above\u201d \u2013 and if audited need to provide documentation to Fair Trading as to how they valued a property.</p> <p>A Fair Trading spokesman told Guardian Australia that a compliance program check conducted in March identified 13 agents to be non-compliant with the new laws. But, overall, complaints from prospective buyers about underquoting had dropped, he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2015, 236 complaints were received about underquoting,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2016 to date, 165 complaints have been received with a steady decline since February. The drop in complaints about underquoting since the new laws commenced, and the positive reaction to the underquoting law reforms from real estate agents, indicates that the new laws have been very successful.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/15/josh-altman-real-estate-sydney-property-overpriced\">'Sexy but overpriced': Kim Kardashian\u2019s real-estate agent snubs Sydney property market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u200bVictoria \u200bintroduced \u200bits legislation to \u200bcrack down on underquoting on Thursday\u200b. The laws will take effect from January.</p> <p>Under the new laws, agents must provide prospective buyers with three recent comparable sales, an indicative selling price and the median price for the suburb. Advertising price ranges of more than 10% will be banned and, like in NSW, terms like \u201coffers above\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d will be banned from pricing. Agents will also be audited.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the real estate agency Hocking Stuart admitted to underquoting in the competitive property market of Richmond, located 3km from Melbourne\u2019s CBD. Consumer Affairs Victoria told the federal court last week that the agency should <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/subscribe/news/1/index.html?sourceCode=HSWEB_WRE170_a_GGL&amp;mode=premium&amp;dest=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/realestate/news/melbourne-vic/hocking-stuart-richmond-should-face-significant-fine-for-underquoting-says-consumer-affairs-victoria/news-story/377f9766d4de4cecabfa3ba75f2a9b82&amp;memtype=registered\">face a severe fine</a>. The agency is part of one of 13 investigations underway by Consumer Affairs Victoria.</p> <p>But buyers\u2019 agent and the chief executive of EPS Property Search, Patrick Bright, is not persuaded that the reforms are effective. He believes more can be done to increase transparency in the industry and to protect buyers from underquoting.</p> <p>\u201cAll the government has done is fiddle around the edges with their reforms,\u201d Bright said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/13/labor-hits-back-at-negative-gearing-shrill-scare-campaign-by-real-estate-industry\">Labor hits back at negative gearing 'shrill scare campaign' by real estate industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say an agent puts $1m as the price guide and then a buyer makes an offer of $1.1m, which the vendor then rejects.

A <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/the-honourable-heidi-victoria-mla-vic-government-make-it-compulsory-to-advertise-auction-reserve-prices-to-stamp-out-under-quoting\">similar petition</a> has also been launched in Victoria.</p> <p>Bright believes the reserve should be made public at least seven days before auction.</p> <p>\u201cThat still gives prospective buyers enough time to organise and pay for building and pest reports but allows them to drop out if they realise the property is beyond their price range,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unfair to entice people to come to an auction and spend money, time and energy when the the truth is the reserve is set at a price where they were never even in the running.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales president, John Cunningham, said he believes the reforms have made a positive difference and go far enough to protect prospective buyers. </p> <p>He said prospective buyers sometimes wrongfully attributed being out of the running for a property to underquoting, when in fact it was just the market at play.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to point the figure and say it\u2019s underquoting,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cWe recently had a property where we gave a guide of $800-850,000 but the market indicated that people would be willing to pay $850-900,000, so we revised the quote. It ended up going for $920,000. It can be an inexact science.\u201d</p> <p>Sydney\u2019s property market was particularly difficult for vendors and agents to predict, he added, and said that, despite sales well over the reserve price being rare, those sales were the ones most often publicised giving buyers the impression of rampant underquoting.</p> <p>\u201cWe have volatile market conditions; in Sydney we have the lowest supply I\u2019ve seen in 40 years in the industry combined with the highest demand,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThe percentage of complaints is so minimal compared to the amount of properties sold. Ultimately people love the auction system, because it is one of the most transparent systems of buying there is.\u201d</p> <p>He disagreed that publishing the reserve price before the auction was reasonable. He believes that, too often, people think only of the problems faced by prospective buyers, rather than the rights of the vendor.</p> <p>\u201cNever in my career have I seen a vendor set reserve price any closer to an auction than two or three days before,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know where to set the reserve until you gather all the feedback.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria\u2019s minister for consumer affairs, Marlene Kairouz, said she was confident that Victoria\u2019s reforms would lead to more transparency and set the right balance between the rights of the buyer and the vendor.</p> <p>\u201cProspective buyers expect and are entitled to a level playing field,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about making sure they don\u2019t waste time and money on properties they can\u2019t afford. These laws send a strong message to agents: think twice before you underquote properties to our homebuyers.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The IOC president, Thomas Bach, was present on a ribald, boozy and tremendously fun night at the Deodoro Stadium to see Australia\u2019s Chloe Esposito overcome a 45-second deficit to win gold in the women\u2019s modern pentathlon. The British representatives, Kate French and Samantha Murray, finished sixth and ninth respectively, the first time Team GB have failed to make the podium since the competition was introduced at Sydney in 2000.</p> <p>Both women had entertained faint hopes of a podium finish after three of the event\u2019s four phases and five disciplines. \u201cI\u2019m really happy, I couldn\u2019t have asked for any more after my fencing yesterday,\u201d said French. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t great but I kept moving up today, I finished 19th yesterday so I moved up a lot.\u201d</p> <p>French finished joint top in the showjumping round while Murray came fourth in the swimming and won an impressive eight consecutive contests before going out in the bonus round of the fencing. The 26-year-old from Preston won silver at London 2012 and became a pub quiz staple in the process, her medal being the final one of 65 in total won at those Games by British athletes. French started the final discipline 59 seconds after the Polish leader, Oktawia Nowacka. Murray was a further nine seconds behind as the field tackled a three kilometre run, pausing occasionally to shoot at targets with a laser pistol. Nowacka eventually finished third, behind Esposito and Eloudie Clouvel from France.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/18/rio-2016-olympics-modern-pentathlon-all-you-need-to-know-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5va8e\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2664725\"            data-video-name=\"Rio 2016 Olympics modern pentathlon: all you need to know \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b573f1e4b062ce4d2246eb\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/18/160821ModernPentathlon2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/18/160821ModernPentathlon2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/18/160821ModernPentathlon2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/18/rio-2016-olympics-modern-pentathlon-all-you-need-to-know-video-explainer\">Rio 2016 Olympics modern pentathlon: all you need to know</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Do not be fooled by the name: this sport is over a century old and was invented with the intention of glorifying manliness and militarism. While its exact history has been disputed since its conception in 1894, it is no more modern than many of that particular year\u2019s other landmark wheezes: Blackpool Tower, the Manchester Ship Canal and the Merseyside derby.</p> <p>Designed to incorporate the skills required by cavalry soldiers of the time, the modern pentathlon included all the hardships a military man behind enemy lines might expect to endure on a particularly bad day: swimming, running, riding an unfamiliar horse and taking on enemies with a pistol or sword: two ways to kill a man, as the Irish broadcaster Ciaran Murphy recently observed, with three more to get away.</p> <p>It is when the unfamiliar horse gets involved that matters stray beyond each athlete\u2019s control. In the wake of the swimming and fencing events, 18 horses were led into the showjumping arena, previously the home of rugby sevens. A well groomed and haughty selection of accomplished bay, chestnut and grey showjumpers ranging in age between eight and 16, they are assigned by ballot to competitors who have never sat on them, with often hilarious consequences. At the Mexico 1968 Olympics, the West German pentathlete Hans J\u00fcrgen Todt had to be separated from the uncooperative Ranchero, after frustration got the better of him and he began swinging haymakers at his steed.<br></p> <p>There was no such violence here and French could not have done better on Arnold Massangana. \u201cI always enjoy the riding but it\u2019s quite hit and miss whether you get on with your horse or not,\u201d she said. \u201cLuckily, I rode really well and my horse was really good to me, so I had a really nice clear.\u201d</p> <p>Murray had to acquaint herself with Up Class Girl, whose biography suggested the eight-year-old mare might be a difficult customer. As the new partnership waited their turn to tackle the obstacles, the mount of Leydi Moya refused and unceremoniously catapulted her rider into a fence and the Cuban was subsequently carried from the arena in a neck brace and on a stretcher. Murray went round unharmed but picked up 21 faults.</p> <p>Previously, in the fencing bonus event, she had done a more than passable impression of Errol Flynn, swishing her \u00e9p\u00e9e with aplomb as she won eight consecutive duels to work her way up the leaderboard. Shrieking \u201cYes!\u201d repeatedly as she won one quick-fire round after another, she might also have been mistaken for Meg Ryan during the famous restaurant scene in When Harry Met Sally. Following the previous day\u2019s fencing ranking event, this new bonus round enabled those who had performed badly to make up ground.</p> <p>Fittingly, given the sport\u2019s origins, Rio 2016\u2019s modern pentathlon was staged on the grounds of the city\u2019s biggest army barracks, the occupants of which have been press-ganged into Olympic security duty. The sight of them at their temporary work suggests a more modern modern pentathlon might incorporate such disciplines as giving directions to lost journalists, posing for photos with foreign sports fans, looking slightly menacing while holding a machine gun and standing around being very bored.</p> <p>While parachute jumping and grenade throwing have long since been eliminated from the sport in favour of more ground-based, less lethal and spectator friendly activities, there have been some more recent innovations.</p> <p>Before 2009 shooting and running were separate events, until the two disciplines were merged to make the former more testing for athletes. It is in this event that the modern pentathlon is won or lost, with the disciplines that precede it dictating in what order the athletes take to the run-and-shoot course and with how much time to make up on the leader.</p> <p>Helping to make an occasionally complicated sport easier to follow, it could scarcely be more simple: everyone sets off at intervals but first past the finishing post wins gold.</p>",
  "<p>Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh may want to reconsider their future. The couple are supposed to be moving to the Netherlands shortly.

The defending Olympic champions had dominated but a goal in the final 10 minutes from Britain\u2019s Nicola White levelled the scores at 3-3 and took it to penalty shuffles.</p> <p>It was Hollie Webb, one of the youngest members of the team at 25, who scored the winning goal. \u201cI watched it go into the net and then I can\u2019t remember anything else since then,\u201d she said. \u201cWe practise them so many times and I just tried to imagine I was training at Bisham Abbey.

The ball clanged into the back of the goal like Calamity Jane shooting a tin can off the head of a drunk.</p> <p>It was a nerveless finish for a team who had said repeatedly throughout this tournament that nothing but gold would do. Eight of the players had been forced to settle for an Olympic bronze at London 2012 after a heartbreaking semi-final defeat. They included captain Kate Richardson-Walsh and her wife Helen, who came into this match with 657 caps between them.</p> <p>They are the first married couple to win gold for Britain since Cyril and Dorothy Wright, who took the 7m sailing class in Antwerp in 1920. To be fair, there were so few yachts competing in that Games only one team went home without a medal. The Richardson-Walshes and the rest of the GB team have bossed this Olympics, defeating all eight sides they faced.</p> <p>The main grandstand was full of Dutch fans. Some wore inflatable crowns while one man had a giant slice of Edam on his head. A tiny pocket of British fans sat right in the middle of the orange mass and made considerably more noise.</p> <p>Britain scored first nine minutes into the game after Bray took on three Dutch players to shoot from the edge of the D and the rebound was tucked away by White. The Netherlands equalised immediately after the first break, when Lidewij Welten stole the ball in midfield. She and Kitty van Male stepped on the accelerator, catching Britain on the break and allowing Van Male to run around Maddie Hinch entirely unhindered. She finished with a flick into the top right corner.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/19/gb-women-historic-hockey-gold-rio-olympics-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vg6k\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2669051\"            data-video-name=\"GB women win historic hockey gold in Rio - video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b7811de4b0b7e649001417\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/19/160819h1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/19/160819h1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/19/160819h1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/19/gb-women-historic-hockey-gold-rio-olympics-video\">GB women win historic hockey gold in Rio</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>For much of the match the Netherlands had set up camp in Britain\u2019s half so comfortably they may have considered lighting fires and sending a few players off for provisions. A penalty corner reached Maartje Pauman 10 minutes into the second quarter and the Dutch captain, who was looking for her third consecutive Olympic title, sent it skimming past Hinch\u2019s outstretched leg.</p> <p>There were army tanks parked forbiddingly on the road leading to the arena. Hinch did much the same job protecting Britain\u2019s goal. A series of brilliant saves kept her team in the game from as early as the 12th minute when Sam Quek fouled Laurien Leurink and conceded a penalty stroke. Paumen\u2019s shot came high and straight at Hinch\u2019s head but she deflected it wide. There were plenty more where that came from, including a brilliant double save against Naomi van As.</p> <p>A long ball that was deflected past a hapless Caia van Maasakker landed in prime scoring position for Crista Cullen who scored to keep Britain in the hunt.

There\u2019s an easy defence here, of course, if you care to seat No Balls (I\u2019ll use the abbreviated version, if I may) in the time-honoured tradition of ghastly political satire. </p> <p>Depending on how far back you want to go, using images where words would be seen as too crass or literal (or actionable) is a time-honoured tradition that stretches back to the Renaissance. <a href=\"http://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/study-of-five-grotesque-heads\">Da Vinci\u2019s array of grotesque little heads</a>, the hellish fantasy landscapes of Dutch masters Hieronymus Bosch or Pieter Bruegel the Elder, which they peopled with every manner of grotesquely distorted, hybrid creature, are proto-examples of conscious social critique through art, while Michelangelo\u2019s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel are <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/michelangelos-secret-message-in-the-sistine-chapel-a-juxtaposition-of-god-and-the-human-brain/\">embedded with cheeky in-jokes </a>aimed at the ruling papal class. In Spain, Diego Velazquez, revered as he was as the official court painter of King Philip IV, <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/diego-velazquez-philip-iv-of-spain\">was a sly subversive</a>, mocking his masters as they imagined him capturing their glory.</p> <p>No Balls, of course, engages in no such subtleties, so let\u2019s push aside the notion of it as art straight off. It\u2019s more in the company of the evolving gutter press of 18th-century England, unique in Europe for having no censorship laws, where the penny press made its fortune on the ribald caricatures of the powerful. (One famous image, from 1740, of an outsize Prime Minister Robert Walpole bent over, trousers down, his giant buttocks gleaming, seems an historical confrere to Indecline\u2019s action this week.) </p> <p>Indeed, No Balls has little affinity with great political art, past or present. One of the most powerful critiques of American policy I\u2019ve seen in recent years came from the American duo <a href=\"http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/allora-and-calzadilla\">Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla</a>, who represented the US at the 2011 Venice Biennale. The duo \u2013 known, though not well \u2013 looked to represent the ardor of their times: using gymnastic routines performed atop an actual 52-ton tank, it conflated militarism and athletics, perhaps America\u2019s best-known exports, within the bounds of sharp political satire (that its nonstop clanking echoed throughout the grounds of the gentle Giardini captured another American hallmark: loudness).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Dmptetj1s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-0Dmptetj1s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla\u2019s tank treadmill</figcaption> </figure>   <p>So where, in the great pantheon of such things, does No Balls sit? Not very high, and for a variety of reasons. Even to take the measure of great caricature, which relies on grotesque hyperbole to prove a point, it falls, if you\u2019ll pardon the pun, a little short.</p> <p>While it receives full marks for its nominal conceit \u2013 hubris, which Trump quite clearly has in no slight supply, has prompted many a leader to lionize themselves in sculptural form \u2013 the stunted member of Trump\u2019s anatomy to which the sculpture means to draw our attention is its undoing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f7ef8908fdac54ec3179d41e40ec0e9b6e1826e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f7ef8908fdac54ec3179d41e40ec0e9b6e1826e/0_0_750_1075/698.jpg\" alt=\"Idol-Worship or the way to preferment, a satire on Walpole.\" width=\"698\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Idol-Worship or the way to preferment, a satire on Walpole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: British Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Emasculation, one can fairly say, is the least notable of Trump\u2019s many shortcomings. No balls? For what presidential candidate in recent memory could that be further from the truth? This is the man who pondered openly how shooting someone on Fifth Avenue might help him poll better. Whatever Trump\u2019s anatomical shortfalls, this is clearly not one of them, and the piece weakens itself with a contradiction to pitch a sophomoric joke. (For what it\u2019s worth, a recent mural of Trump\u2019s nemesis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/02/hillary-clinton-mural-covered-with-niqab-after-public-decency-complaints\">Hillary Clinton, appeared on a wall in Australia in much the same fashion</a>; the candidate was portrayed as busty, bikini-clad and dripping $100 bills. The cash we can understand, but the body? Like Trump, the tasteless non-sequitur is undone not by its lack of taste, but its lack of point.)</p> <p>Speaking of anatomy \u2013 mercifully, in a general sense this time \u2013 there\u2019s an argument to be made that, for Trump, given his own lack of boundaries, none should apply. But No Balls crosses, perhaps unintentionally, into territory that serves to undermine whatever message it may mean to carry. The piece, with its slumpy, distended belly, withered buttocks and sagging pectorals, crosses callously into generalized ageism and body-shaming; unlike the attempted caricaturization of Trump\u2019s particular bits, this is no joke, but rather an expression of unmitigated contempt, and whatever else it does, it dissolves satirical intent in an instant. </p> <p>There are some that may say, in an age of Kardashians, Jenners and Cyruses, that no such rules apply, but I don\u2019t think so. Whomever one is talking about, shaming his or her physical self is worse than cruelty for its own sake (though it is that): it\u2019s irrelevant. </p> <p>The group has made clever interventions in the past \u2013 replacing the names of stars on Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame with the names of black men killed by police was a tightly bundled critique of the media and society\u2019s rabidly misplaced attentions \u2013 but here, intended satire gives way to blind hatred that obscures their intent. And there\u2019s nothing funny about that. </p>",
  "<p>These are still early days but already there is the unmistakable feeling Manchester United are on their way back and anxious to make up for lost time. They have suffered more in the last few years than they will probably wish to remember but Jos\u00e9 Mourinho could be seen saluting the crowd in triumph after this victory. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has two more goals for his personal collection while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/18/paul-pogba-manchester-united-jose-mourinho\">Paul Pogba, the world\u2019s most expensive</a> footballer, came out of his homecoming with a sunrise of a smile.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/19/paul-pogba-manchester-united-jose-mourinho\">Paul Pogba shows he can play big part in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s revitalisation project | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only disappointment, perhaps, was that Ibrahimovic could not mark his first appearance at his new ground by taking the matchball home as a souvenir of a hat-trick, and there was a moment after the game when he playfully chastised Pogba for shooting, rather than passing, during a late attack. That, however, was only a fleeting source of regret bearing in mind the buoyant mood inside the stadium and renewed sense of optimism.</p> <p>Pogba showed, in flashes, why United have invested so much in shaping the team around him. Ibrahimovic has scored three times in his first two Premier League games and it says something for Mourinho\u2019s rebuilding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/06/manchester-united-henrikh-mkhitaryan-signs\">Henrikh Mkhitaryan, another of the club\u2019s</a> summer recruits, was restricted to a late substitute\u2019s appearance, with Michael Carrick, Phil Jones and Memphis Depay among those not even on the bench. Mourinho seemed genuinely pained when he spoke of the players who spent the night \u201cin their nice Paul Smith suits rather than tracksuits\u201d.</p> <p>More than anything there was the sense of more to come. A new team are taking shape, featuring half a dozen six-footers, and Mourinho made the point there was still plenty of room for improvement. The partnership between Wayne Rooney and Ibrahimovic, for instance, can still be better even if they did combine for the Swede\u2019s opening goal. Anthony Martial has started the season slowly and Pogba, as Mourinho explained, was not at the point of optimum fitness even if there were times when the \u00a389m signing showed a mixture of speed, balance and control that had Old Trafford humming its approval.</p> <p>After an amusingly bad first touch Pogba looked as if he had been here years \u2013 which, in one sense, was absolutely the case \u2013 while Ibrahimovic supplied another clear reminder United have recruited a striker who is capable of outdoing some of the finest central defenders in England\u2019s top division.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/19/manchester-united-v-southampton-premier-league-live\">Manchester United 2-0 Southampton: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wes Morgan can testify for Ibrahimovic\u2019s upper body strength, competitive instincts and prodigious heading ability after the winning goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/07/leicester-city-manchester-united-community-shield-match-report\">in the Community Shield</a> and now it was Jos\u00e9 Fonte\u2019s turn to feel the force. Ibrahimovic\u2019s second goal was a penalty, early in the second half, but his first was another demonstration of his penalty-box menace. Rooney\u2019s cross came from the right and Ibrahimovic, at 6ft 5in, was higher, stronger and more decisive in his leap than Fonte, directing an expertly angled header into the corner of Fraser Forster\u2019s goal.</p> <p>United\u2019s improvement is clear already, given they were facing a Southampton side who had won 1-0 on their last two visits to Old Trafford and aiming to become the only team other than Manchester City to win here three times in a row in the Premier League era.</p> <p>Claude Puel had started with an adventurous lineup, with Nathan Redmond and Shane Long in attack, and Dusan Tadic operating at the front of a midfield diamond. Their preparations were disrupted by an early injury to Oriol Romeu but they held their own early on and threatened sporadically throughout.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/20/jose-mourinho-paul-pogba-manchester-united-southampton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vhda\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2669959\"            data-video-name=\"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: Paul Pogba was phenomenal against Southampton \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b7fef4e4b0b7e6490015e7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/20/160820manusoton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/20/160820manusoton.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/20/160820manusoton_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/20/jose-mourinho-paul-pogba-manchester-united-southampton-video\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: Paul Pogba was phenomenal against Southampton</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>At other times they looked lightweight in attack while, for the home side, it was clear to see this was a Mourinho team rather than one operating to Louis van Gaal\u2019s rigid tactics. United moved the ball with the kind of urgency that was not always apparent under their previous manager. Their full-backs were given more licence to go forward and it was from one of those attacks that Luke Shaw advanced into a position where Jordy Clasie, Romeu\u2019s replacement, flicked out his foot to clip him for the penalty. Ibrahimovic took the ball \u2013 no arguments about who was United\u2019s new penalty-taker \u2013 and rifled his shot to Forster\u2019s right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/19/golden-goal-david-beckham-manchester-united-wimbledon-1996-halfway-line\">Golden Goal: David Beckham for Manchester United against Wimbledon (1996)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shortly before, Tadic had turned a header past David de Gea only for the goal to be disallowed because one of the assistant referees had raised his flag. Puel did not complain too vociferously about either decision but Southampton had been entitled to be aggrieved about the penalty and, at 2-0, the home side could start to relax, playing with greater exuberance on the counterattack.</p> <p>Mourinho had said Pogba would not last the entire match but the midfielder did stay on until the end. Marouane Fellaini has been rejuvenated so far under Mourinho and, continuing the theme of newfound unity, Juan Mata was warmly embraced by his manager when Mkhitaryan replaced him for the last quarter of an hour.</p> <p>Ibrahimovic was offside when Antonio Valencia clipped a cross to him at the far post and Pogba drilled a late chance past the post. \u201cYou should have passed,\u201d Ibrahimovic pointed out to his team-mate, with mock anger.

Here\u2019s part of his report:</p> <p><strong>To gain clarity following yet another Trump campaign shakeup,</strong> I read Breitbart exclusively for two days, eschewing all other news sources. (The Guardian included. Apart from its soccer coverage.)</p> <p>It offered an insight into not just the popularity of Breitbart \u2013 the site boasted <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/08/07/blow-breitbart-news-sets-traffic-records-july-192-million-pageviews-31-million-uniques-89-million-visits/\">31 million unique visitors</a> in July \u2013 but also how it appeals to its readers. And it\u2019s not as straightforward as you might imagine.</p> <p>The first thing you notice when visiting Breitbart is its idiosyncratic presentation. Every headline is in capitals. It implies a sense of significance and dire urgency.</p> <p>It screams at you. \u201cTHIS IS IMPORTANT,\u201d is the effect. \u201cTHIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.\u201d \u201cTHIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS COUNTRY GOING TO HELL IN A HANDCART.\u201d</p> <p>The last of those points is an example of how well Breitbart knows its audience.</p> <p>This doomsday approach makes it seem like Breitbart readers want to feel that everything is rotten. They want to feel irate. They want to feel that disaster is impending \u2013 unless their guys can fix it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/766701818172743680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are actually some jobs that foreigners will do that Americans won&#39;t. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamgabbatt\">@adamgabbatt</a> demonstrates for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianUS\">@GuardianUS</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RMzSHy2LtN\">https://t.co/RMzSHy2LtN</a></p>&mdash; Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/766701818172743680\">August 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/johntabin/status/766700215445454848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs\">@Bencjacobs</a> is &quot;soccer&quot; Guardian house style now?

Even allowing for the commonly long careers in equestrian sport, it is a singular record. It might not have been after a broken neck in 2000 forced his retirement but his full recovery and return to competition two years later has been the stuff of showjumping folklore.</p> <p>Despite six world and 10 European championship medals, the Olympics always proved a tougher mark. He was leading on a horse named Arko until the final round in Athens 2004 before blowing it, and only in 2012 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/06/london-2012-olympics-showjumping\">did he finally make the podium</a> with gold as part of the GB jumping team.

Big Star, dancing eagerly on his toes before the off as if he knew his moment had arrived, tore into the course with visible enthusiasm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/charley-hull-olympic-golf-justin-rose\">Charley Hull on course for Olympic success with help from Justin Rose</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over bars, double and triple jumps and a water obstacle he soared, tossing his head with the arrogance of a champion in between. The result was near perfect, another double clear, and catapulted Skelton to the top of the standings as the sole rider with no penalties in either round.</p> <p>A wait followed to see who could match him. Steve Guerdat, the Swiss reigning Olympic champion, nailed it with immaculate precision on board Nino des Buissonnets, guaranteeing a jump\u2011off. They were soon joined by the Qatari Sheikh Ali Al\u2011Thani, a member of the Gulf state\u2019s royal family on board the equally regal-looking First Devision, and then Kent Farrington of the US, who seemed to grin through his double clear round aboard Voyeur. Peder Fredricson of Sweden joined the elite crew, as did Canada\u2019s Eric Lamaze, and now six would contest the medals.</p> <p>Skelton was first out. This time Big Star looked calmer. They stood still before the off, knowing exactly what was required but Skelton again jumped aggressively, throwing his horse through the obstacles with all the risk/reward mastery of his years. Another double clear.</p> <p>\u201cI was first to go in the jump-off, and I thought in my mind to go as fast as I could, but be safe,\u201d Skelton said. \u201cHe\u2019s a quick horse anyway, and I had to be clear, because it adds a bit of pressure on everyone else. I needed luck on my side, and it was today.\u201d</p> <p>Guerdat was up next and cracked, hitting the first fence. Then the Sheikh from Qatar, so upright as to be almost leaning backwards, lost his cool and knocked over two. Shakey. The American Farrington winged a couple and Skelton was guaranteed a medal. But which colour?</p> <p>Last to go were Pederson and Lamaze. The Swede looked good and went clear but with time now added as a factor, came in 0.53 behind Skelton. Silver at least. Lamaze was fast but not quite accurate, clipping a single fence and Skelton, approaching his seventh decade, had his first individual gold medal and Britain\u2019s 23rd in Rio. It was silver for Pederson and bronze for Lamaze.</p> <p>Skelton was besieged in the aftermath, flushed and euphoric, signing shirts like a superstar and grappled repeatedly in bear hugs from friends and admirers at the Deodoro Arena. But, like nearly all in his sport, he reserved the strongest affections for his Dutch-bred horse.</p> <p>\u201cToday [Big Star] was absolutely amazing. The last competition he won was the Aachen grand prix in 2013 \u2013 it has been two years to get him back. It has taken a lot of work, but I always knew if we could get him right then he could do this.</p> <p>\u201cHe is an absolutely amazing horse. He has all the right attributes and he is the best horse I am ever likely to have. I have nursed him and nursed him, and he has come good for me \u2013 this is for him.\u201d</p> <p>Big Star is 13.

For two weeks of the Olympics, everyone talks knowledgeably about sports they\u2019ve only just heard of. Entirely fact-free opinions are legitimised, and unlike, say, any mention of the Labour leadership, it does not end in tears.</p> <p>The Olympics has almost fallen to the monsters of marginal advantage, so professional that the life\u2019s been knocked right out of them. They don\u2019t keep me up at night. Not that I disapprove of winning. I\u2019m as easily lulled as the next person into basking in five minutes of reflected national glory.

It was a joy to hear the two of them saying the craic was great, they\u2019d enjoyed putting on the podium pants, but all the same they were almost sorry they weren\u2019t home in Skibbereen with their mates. Then they said they\u2019d had nothing to eat since bread and nutella two hours before the race and they were looking forward to a pizza. That\u2019s my kind of Olympic spirit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"871fca18d586d0fb85deef5824d778e1d87dbef3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/871fca18d586d0fb85deef5824d778e1d87dbef3/0_108_5560_3335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary, left, and Paul O\u2019Donovan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary, left, and Paul O\u2019Donovan brought the craic to Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Suzanne Moore</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cf1c72bf132b7aca65f245533bba7a08218385bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1c72bf132b7aca65f245533bba7a08218385bb/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Suzanne Moore\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In total I reckon I\u2019ve watched about 15 minutes of the Olympics, and that\u2019s been on YouTube.

If it\u2019s been on TV I have to turn the sound down \u2013 not just because of the banal sexism of the commentators, but for the inane prattle in general, the continual repetition of the bleedin\u2019 obvious.

The winners seem so thrilled and humble and lovely, and you would have to be completely devoid of feeling not to share in their happiness.</p> <p>It\u2019s sad, though, that they have to wear the dreadful outfits. Sometimes, too, what may be exciting to participate in just doesn\u2019t make good telly. Cycling, for instance? They just look like a load of weird insects trapped in a wooden box.

Posed so starkly, the price tag smacked of venality. So why am I still smiling? Because, more even than the London Games, these Olympics have cemented Britain\u2019s position as a first-rank sporting nation. Sporting excellence requires subsidy and patronage. How could it be otherwise? We can rail against this simple reality in ascetic fury, or join in the revelry.</p> <p>Since Orwell described international sport as \u201cmimic warfare\u201d and \u201cwar minus the shooting\u201d, it has been commonplace to dismiss the Olympics as a petri dish of nationalism. But Orwell\u2019s The Sporting Spirit was published in 1945 when the gap between patriotism and nationalism still seemed dangerously narrow. In 2016, we can surely draw a distinction between the two.</p> <p>Our extraordinary athletes exemplify the diversity of their home nation, and a spirit of grace in victory.

I remember this sick-making, skin-pricking fury, sitting next to an American journalist who was cheering after Victoria Pendleton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/victoria-pendleton-loses-anna-meares\">had to cede gold to that Australian bruiser</a> who squeezed her out of her lane.</p> <p>I have lost my patriotic fervour, and now mainly see the British cyclists as superb through some combination of talent born not made, incredibly hard work, a sublime intelligence at both the level of the muscle and the mind; and not because they are British and understand at some cellular, interconnected level why bulldogs are cute and the NHS is great and bikes matter.</p> <p>In the absence of obnoxious national pride, I now mainly enjoy the sports in which the difference between being the best in the world and being completely rubbish are naked to the untrained eye. There you are, watching judo. One minute they\u2019re just poking each other. The next, one has a hundred points and the other is crying. Rhythmic gymnastics is particularly piquant for this. Sometimes you can\u2019t tell for hours whether the tears are joy or loss. I love the things that don\u2019t look that hard - archery, the 50km walk \u2013 and things that look superhuman.</p>",

As a soldier on Olympic duty, his death was cause for interim president Michel Temer to declare national mourning and for flags outside the Games venues to fly at half-mast.<br></p> <p>As is often the case in Rio, it also prompted the police to launch an extensive and punitive hunt for the killers. At least five residents of Mar\u00e9 were killed in the operations, though the suspects have yet to be apprehended. Images of the area in the local media show that it<a href=\"http://odia.ig.com.br/rio-de-janeiro/policia-fecha-o-cerco-na-mare-para-capturar-autores-de-ataque-a-forca/57ac89490f3adfb937000e15.html#foto=1\"> came under a state of semi-siege</a>, with police helicopters flying overhead and homes raided by heavily armed military police.<br></p> <p>The day before the Guardian visited the community, two people had been shot in the latest police action, according to local residents, who said they were woken up on many days by the sound of helicopters buzzing close overhead. \u201cIt\u2019s horribly loud,\u201d said Bruno Rodrigues, who, like many local people, asked to be identified with a pseudonym for fear of repercussions. \u201cEveryone in the community is afraid when they hear that as it means an operation is about to start.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike many other favelas in Rio, Vila de Jo\u00e3o has never been \u201cpacified\u201d by police. On one street stands a gangster from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terceiro_Comando_Puro\">Terceiro Comando Puro</a>, or Pure Third Command faction, one of Mar\u00e9\u2019s biggest drug trafficking gangs, with a semiautomatic rifle slung around his neck and a handgun jammed into the top of his trousers. Further along, there are lookouts carrying walkie talkies.</p> <p>At the site of Andrade\u2019s shooting near the junction of the airport motorway, the walls on one side of the street are marked with words \u201cPaz\u201d (peace) and \u201cSeja bem vindo para Vila da Jo\u00e3o\u201d (Welcome to Vila da Jo\u00e3o). On the other is a small pitch where a group of youths are playing volleyball. It looks tranquil, but Rodrigues warns me we are being watched. \u201cDon\u2019t take pictures. Don\u2019t point,\u201d he advises me.</p> <p>The initials \u201cTCP\u201d sprayed on the walls are the only visible sign that this is gang-controlled territory. Most taxi drivers avoid the area; those who must come here do so with their car windows wound down and their hands visible so they can show they are not a threat.<br></p> <p>But it is all too easy for strangers like Andrade to wander in accidentally; the state trooper was far from the first to be killed by a wrong turn. </p> <p>In 2013, engineer Gil Barbosa, 53, was shot dead by gang members when he tried to use the junction to return home. Occasional shootouts across the motorwayhave left the walls on the roadside pitted with bullet holes. Traffic jams are sometimes targeted by armed robbers who work their way methodically along the line of immobilized vehicles.<br></p> <p>During the Olympics, with athletes, officials and visiting dignitaries travelling back and forth between the airport and the city centre, the authorities have flooded the route with troops. Every 15 minutes or so, military patrols drive past with trucks carrying soldiers in full battle gear and brandishing rifles.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe security is to protect them from us,\u201d says Rodrigues. \u201cThe Olympics is for those on the outside. Those who have money.\u201d</p> <p>His views appear to be widely shared in Mar\u00e9. \u201cThe police don\u2019t come here to protect us, but to segregate us,\u201d says Jeferson Luciano, a participant in a community theatre group, called Teatro do Oprimado na Mar\u00e9 \u2013 the theatre of the oppressed in Mar\u00e9.<br></p> <p>On social networks, community activists expressed condolences for Andrade\u2019s death, but said the violent police action that followed was disproportionate, disruptive and failed to discriminate between criminals and innocent residents.<br></p> <p>\u201cUntil now, the balance is five people dead, several injured and thousands of people prevented from working, studying, because they are scared, terrified and their homes are being invaded ... The name of this is genocide, extermination, slaughter. And nobody says anything,\u201d read one post on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Marevive/posts/1079358132099638\">Mar\u00e9 Vive Facebook page</a>, which informs residents about shootouts and other issues. </p> <p>Another Mar\u00e9 resident, who preferred to remain unnamed, said there were similar problems in other favelas, even those that were supposed to have been \u201cpacified\u201d by police units. For her, it is simply about control.</p> <p>\u201cThe legacy we have of mega-events in Mar\u00e9 is blood on the floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThese Games do not include <em>favelas</em>, peripheral communities and the poor. We are only supposed to work, to serve, not to have fun.\u201d<br></p> <p>Well before the Games began, human rights organisations warned of the potential dangers. Amnesty said <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/06/deadly-side-rio-olympics-2016/\">Rio\u2019s police had killed over 2,500 people since the Games were awarded in 2009</a>, including more than 100 this year, most of whom were young black men. It said crackdowns tended to increase during mega-events.<br></p> <p>The Olympics has not been all bad for communities like Mar\u00e9.

  "<p>In August 2007, Peter Connelly, a blond, blue-eyed toddler from north London, was found dead in his cot at home. Just over a year later, in November 2008, Peter\u2019s mother, Tracy Connelly, her boyfriend, Steven Barker, and his brother, Jason Owen, were convicted of \u201ccausing or allowing\u201d Peter\u2019s death, and the public, shocked by the horrific details of the abuse \u2013 he had more than 50 injuries to his small body \u2013 wanted to know how it had happened.</p> <p>The case was heartbreaking, though hardly clear-cut. The events leading up to the tragedy involved a range of public agencies: Peter was on Haringey council\u2019s child protection register and had been seen more than 60 times by social workers, police and health workers. But no one anticipated the extreme public response to the convictions (there had been 56 other child homicides in the year Peter died, none of which provoked a similar reaction), and the tragedy rapidly snowballed into a major political crisis involving David Cameron, then an unproven leader of the Tory opposition; Ed Balls, Labour\u2019s powerful secretary of state for children and families; and Rebekah Brooks, then editor of the Sun.</p> <p>Cameron, possibly looking to promote his \u201cBroken Britain\u201d agenda, declared Baby P to be a Labour policy failure \u2013 breaking a parliamentary convention that child deaths are not exploited for political gain. He was enthusiastically cheered on by Brooks, whose reporters relentlessly pursued Haringey\u2019s director of children\u2019s services, Sharon Shoesmith, and who set up a Sun petition calling for her to be fired. Balls, wrong-footed by Cameron and unsettled by the shrill media response to the death, set in train events that would lead within a month to Shoesmith\u2019s brutal sacking by Balls, live on TV.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/29/ed-balls-sharon-shoesmith-baby-p-sacking-payout\">Ed Balls: no regrets about sacking Sharon Shoesmith over Baby P affair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today Shoesmith is a mixture of steely resolve and vulnerability, of resilience and apprehension. She says she has come to terms with what happened to her, but especially in public, \u201cI remain anxious that someone is going to come at me.\u201d It is understandable, given the thoroughness with which she was vilified. Tabloid journalists camped outside her door. She was demonised daily in the press, harassed in the streets and \u2013 in a foreshadowing of today\u2019s social media storms \u2013 subjected to thousands of abusive texts and a hail of online abuse, including death threats. At times she considered taking her own life.</p> <p>Today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/19/stop-scapegoating-social-workers-to-better-protect-children-shoesmith-says\">Shoesmith publishes a book</a> that attempts to understand why and how she became public enemy No 1. It is remarkably calm and forensically well-researched (it is based on the PhD she undertook after she lost her job). There is little outward bitterness towards the politicians who opportunistically hung her out to dry (though it is a fascinating account of the frenzied realpolitik in Westminster and the media at the tail end of New Labour). The book is not about her, she says, nor about settling scores, but about politics and the media, about blame and the power of public emotion.</p> <p>For all its comprehensive and persuasive dissection of the Baby P effect, she has no expectations that the book will change the negative public and tabloid media view of her. \u201cI do not have a choice, really. It\u2019s what I have to live with.\u201d There have been some successful attempts over the years to unpick what might be called the Sun\u2019s version of events, including a powerful BBC documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/baby-p-untold-story-cover-up-bbc\">Baby P \u2013 the Untold Story</a>, which was broadcast two years ago and systematically deconstructed the idea that social workers alone were to blame for Peter\u2019s death. Even Brooks admitted during the Leveson inquiry that her paper\u2019s coverage of Shoesmith had been \u201ccruel, harsh and over the top\u201d. But the deep-rooted narrative that Shoesmith and the social workers were to blame is hard to shift; facts incongruent with that dominant narrative, she says, tend to be filtered out, and challenging it can be seen as \u201ctantamount to condoning Peter\u2019s death\u201d. In June she was interviewed by Piers Morgan on the TV show Good Morning Britain. \u201cStraight away it was an attack,\u201d she recalls, Morgan accusing her of calling herself a \u201cvictim\u201d, something she says she has never done.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"18785b519ad0b25f2c1efcc9969fbb3ad5a5b9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18785b519ad0b25f2c1efcc9969fbb3ad5a5b9c9/0_261_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Connelly, also known as Baby P\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Connelly, also known as Baby P</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: itv NEWS/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She has close friends and family who know her and who she really is, she says, and that protects her: \u201cEnough people who know me reflect that back to me.\u201d But she will never control her public identity: \u201cNobody wants to hear. You cannot reconstruct yourself. It continues. You are defined as this person and nobody wants to change it.\u201d</p> <p>Her book contains a brilliant chapter \u2013 based in part on private Whitehall emails that came to light during her own legal fight \u2013 that charts how the political establishment, hand-in-hand with the media, allowed a narrative of individual blame to deflect criticism from themselves and construct a simple explanation for a complex story. As she pored over the emails years after the event, it was a shock to realise how, within six days of the conviction of Peter\u2019s killers, it was decided behind the scenes that she and Haringey\u2019s social workers were to be held responsible. (The role of the police and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jun/14/baby-peter-whistleblower-great-ormond-street-apologises\">Great Ormond Street hospital</a> would be largely ignored.)</p> <p>Shoesmith writes of how the Ofsted inquiry report gave Balls, who was under pressure from Brooks, the ammunition to sack her. Her dismissal, Shoesmith realised, was the price of political closure. \u201cHow naive was I!\u201d she says. \u201cLooking back at the court material, there was a sense that [they felt that] if they hit me hard enough I would never stand up again.

That was the point of absolute shock, mental and physical horror that took years to overcome.\u201d</p> <p>A few days before her sacking, a well-meaning colleague rang her with some advice. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018There is no way back from this: move out, change your name, resign, go and buy a little house in Essex or somewhere and start all over again.\u2019\u201d She was horrified. She vowed that she couldn\u2019t resign, because this would have implied guilt. In the book she explains: \u201cHaving spent a lifetime working for children, I was unable to countenance being held responsible for the murder of a child. My resignation would most certainly have signified personal responsibility, and the many distortions of what had been reported in the media would remain unchallenged. I was being invited to take the blame, or be the scapegoat, for the killing of Peter Connelly, presented as my \u2018public accountability\u2019\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"978f30304f3bc881d5c2fb6d38a88fe494ffd693\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/978f30304f3bc881d5c2fb6d38a88fe494ffd693/0_56_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoesmith (second from left) outside the High Court in London after winning appeal against her sacking following the death of Baby P.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoesmith (second from left) outside the High Court in London in May 2011, after winning an appeal against her sacking following the death of Baby P.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of the criticism of her then and since has been about the notion that she did not apologise, or was not apologetic enough; and that she, as the accountable director, should have taken responsibility. She says she apologised many times for the failure of safeguarding staff to prevent the death, but she will never apologise in a way that suggests she was responsible for his death. The judge in her court case, she says, pointed out that \u201cpublic accountability does not mean that heads should roll\u201d. If every children\u2019s director resigned after a child homicide, there would be no one in post, she says. Accountability has to be realistic: \u201cYou cannot expect that social workers can prevent every death of every child. You have to remember that this is happening every week, not all of them known to social care.\u201d</p> <p>Refusing to slink away from Haringey was not just about pride, she realised, but about protecting her sanity. \u201cYour identity gets very knocked about. Identity is important, because you have a self-perception of who you are, what sort of person you are, and, of course, I saw myself as someone who cared deeply, and I wasn\u2019t the person I was being portrayed as. People say: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you just change your name?\u2019 But changing your name is tantamount to guilt as well in the end.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/baby-p-untold-story-cover-up-bbc\">Baby P: the Untold Story is the anatomy of an establishment cover-up | Patrick Butler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It probably came as a surprise to Balls and Haringey (which had formally sacked her without compensation) when Shoesmith got up off the floor and launched a judicial review for unfair dismissal in March 2009. Two years later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2013/oct/29/sharon-shoesmith-agrees-unfair-dismissal\">she won</a>. Lord Justice Kay declared that Shoesmith was \u201centitled to be treated lawfully and fairly, and not simply summarily scapegoated\u201d. Balls, the judge said, had denied Shoesmith \u201celementary fairness\u201d in his treatment of her. Haringey\u2019s sacking of her, he ruled, was \u201ctainted by unfairness\u201d. In theory, she had won her case. In practice, she soon understood, things were not quite so straightforward. \u201cThe big disappointment for me was that [although] I did win, people wanted to say, \u2018Yes, but it was only a technicality\u2019. I knew it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She was criticised in the media as grasping and disrespectful; for having the temerity to fight for compensation. She would never really \u201cwin\u201d, it seemed; never be forgiven for not resigning, or not meeting the ever-rising bar of contrition demanded by her detractors. Worse, by the time her court saga was over, in 2011, \u201cI was starting to lose my grip on reality.\u201d</p> <p>Many of her professional friends had by this time melted away. She would go for 10-mile walks from her London flat each day, and see \u201cfamiliar faces\u201d in crowds or on the opposing pavements. She would run over to greet them only to discover it was someone else entirely. \u201cWhen you lose it all at once, your brain is searching out familiarity,\u201d she says. She enrolled in a course of psychotherapy, but quit when one of her fellow students started selling stories about her to the Sun. Having worked six days a week as a senior director, she found herself unemployable.</p> <p>Her recovery began when she started a PhD at Birkbeck University to try to piece together what had happened. She immersed herself in psychological theory, and painstakingly pulled together a chronological account of events in Haringey from the thousands of pages of documents released during the court case. It was a painful experience. She often felt isolated. In her darkest moments she would open the file in which she kept supportive messages sent to her over the years and reread them. She also kept in touch with the four Haringey social workers who were sacked in the wake of Baby P\u2019s death. Together they have an informal self-help group that has carried them through whenever one of them might feel like \u201cjumping out of the bloody window\u201d. Shoesmith is closest to anger when she talks of how her former staff were treated by the media. At the height of the witch hunt, one was forced to leave her home. \u201cShe had lived there for 19 years. She had to get in a van in the middle of the night and scuttle off like some criminal, and she has lived in hiding ever since. That\u2019s how we treat social workers in modern Britain.\u201d</p> <p>But there is much to be be learned from the Baby P case, she believes, not least in the way we handle our expectations of child protection. Politicians too often play to public fantasies that safeguarding systems exist that will ensure child homicides will \u201cnever happen again\u201d. The brutality of the official response in Haringey did not go unnoticed among social workers: thousands more children were swiftly taken into care across England, many no doubt unecessarily, as nervous safeguarders decided a no-risk approach would keep them off the front page of the Sun. The \u201cBaby P effect\u201d means that roughly 20,000 more children a year are in care now compared to 2008, she points out: \u201cIt is highly likely that not all these children needed to come into care.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/jun/23/closing-the-college-of-social-work-is-yet-another-attack-on-the-profession\">Closing the College of Social Work is yet another attack on the profession</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It would be understandable if Shoesmith were consumed by bitterness, but she claims one of the first things she did as part of her recovery was \u201cwork out the anger\u201d. She is sad that she will never work again, but philosophical. The tabloid media, she believes, will never leave her alone, and will see the publication of the book as a provocation in itself. Yesterday, the Sun and the Mail pounced, accusing her of \u201cprofiting\u201d from Peter\u2019s death by publishing the book (she says she did not receive an advance, and any royalties will be spent on funding her work in raising awareness about child homicides). She does admit to taking some satisfaction in the spectacular falls from power of her political tormentors, although oddly she appears to understand the actions of Balls, her nemesis: \u201c[He] had the whole of Labour\u2019s social policy for a decade on his shoulders. I can see where [he was] coming from.\u201d</p> <p>She wrote to Balls in 2011, asking to meet, but didn\u2019t hear back. After he lost his seat at the last election, she recalls hearing his wife, Yvette Cooper, talking on the radio about the impact on Balls of losing his job, and she felt a strange sense of empathy. She\u2019d still love to meet him: \u201cI\u2018ve got a PhD, he\u2019s on Strictly [Come Dancing],\u201d she smiles. \u201cMaybe he would like to meet me and have a chat?

One of the biggest barriers to a repeat, however, is the very nature of the work Britain\u2019s part-time, self-employed army carries out. </p> <p>Workers at Deliveroo, the online food delivery firm, won a rare victory in seeing off an attempt to force them to sign up to new pay terms. Deliveroo\u2019s change of heart followed several days of protests by its drivers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/deliveroo-announces-it-will-not-force-new-contracts-on-workers\">Deliveroo announces it will not force new contracts on workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The protests, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/11/deliveroo-couriers-demonstrate-against-new-contract\">in which more than 100 moped riders and cyclists took to the streets</a> after being told they would have to move from an hourly rate to payment per delivery, marked a new assertiveness among workers in the UK\u2019s so-called gig economy. </p> <p>Dr Alex Wood, a sociologist at Oxford University who is studying the gig economy and collective action, said the success of the Deliveroo strike could motivate other workers. \u201cOne of the most important elements for any action is that they believe there is a chance of it being successful,\u201d he said. \u201cThat fact that the workers have got some concessions out of it will inspire other workers to think it is worthwhile.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, who has been campaigning for better treatment of low-paid workers, is less optimistic. She said it was hard for those employed in the gig economy - the term for temporary, self-employed work - to organise and agitate for better pay and conditions. </p> <p>\u201cThey are not in the same workplace and there is not the same unity of cause. There is always somebody who will do it if you don\u2019t want to. There is a big role for unions in this area, but they will have to change the way they are working and offer different services,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Mags Dewhurst, the chair of the couriers and logistics branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) helped the Deliveroo drivers draw up a list of demands. She said she had tried to recruit workers before the recent pay protests, but without much luck. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/16/deliveroo-couriers-strike-freedom-william-shu\">Deliveroo couriers are right to strike: the company\u2019s claims of freedom are a sham | Mags Dewhurst</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe difficulty we faced had been accessing them.

Workers no longer feel empowered to act | Gregor Gall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are challenges, however, for unions that consider the cost of engaging with self-employed workers in the gig economy to be too high, according to Wood. \u201cThere\u2019s a high turnover of people and there\u2019s low market bargaining power. If they go on strike it\u2019s not going to bring the economy to a halt, unlike coal miners or rail workers,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Social media and digital technology will probably play a key role in low-pay campaigns, he added. \u201cEven amongst the workers who are working around the world from home we find most of them join online social networks through Facebook, forums and blogs,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much formal training in the gig economy so the only way they can make it work for them is to get support from other workers. They need to learn from each other. They\u2019ll find ways to meet up and exchange information. These networks form the basis for people to share dissatisfactions.\u201d</p> <p>The use of social media has taken employers by surprise. Workers for Deliveroo and the parcel firm Hermes have used closed social media groups to exchange information about things they are unhappy about, and messages about the protests were spread on open Facebook group pages and on Twitter.</p> <p>Dewhurst said firms\u2019 reliance on digital technology for their business models also laid them open to the possibility of workers\u2019 action. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/30/job-pay-workers-gig-economy\">\u2018Love the job, hate the way we\u2019re treated\u2019: life on the frontline of UK\u2019s delivery army</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although this kind of tech has been designed to isolate individuals and atomise work, deskilling the industry and driving down wages, the very platform it uses to do that is hugely vulnerable to ad-hoc collective action by groups of individuals,\u201d she said. </p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s now very easy for Deliveroo to hire and fire people, but equally easy for drivers to decide not to work, and when they decide do to it altogether, can garner huge leverage against their would-be employer.

It is also a long way from how some other politicians have behaved after an unexpected defeat. </p> <p>The morning after his electoral annihilation by Tony Blair, for example, John Major went to the Oval cricket ground, where he has been a regular visitor since his Brixton boyhood, to watch Surrey play British Universities.</p> <p>The journalist and former professional cricketer Ed Smith, who was playing in that 1997 match, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/left-field\">recalls that despite his humiliation</a> Major \u201cvisited both dressing rooms, chatting courteously with all of us.

As Michael Portillo, the bumptious Conservative defence minister whose political career was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/sep/12/conservatives.uk\">gloriously terminated in the Blair landslide</a>, put it: \u201cMy name is now synonymous with eating a bucketload of shit in public.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/dazed-defeated-and-under-employed-how-politicians-cope-after-losing-an-election-37559\">A 2015 study by the Open University</a> revealed the extent of the emotional carnage unforeseen defeat can wreak. Interviews with 30 politicians, including MPs who lost their seats in the 2010 election, revealed \u201cshock, hurt, devastation, guilt, betrayal, a sense of failure \u2026 and shame\u201d lasting sometimes many months, the study\u2019s author, Jane Roberts, concluded.</p> <p>The upset and pain of losing (\u201cInside I was smashed to pieces \u2026 It took every ounce of emotional strength, but you\u2019ve got to hold it together,\u201d one former MP told the researcher) is equalled only by the difficulty of adjusting to a new reality.</p> <p>Defeated politicians \u201csuddenly lose a demanding, busy but valued role\u201d, Roberts said. \u201cSuddenly they are no longer relevant to any political debate.

  "<p>When Donald Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">hired</a> Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon to lead his presidential campaign, many immediately wondered: what can we expect from the new Bannon-led campaign? And what is Breitbart News? </p> <p>Bannon has been described variously as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-steve-bannon/\">\u201cthe most dangerous political operative in America\u201d</a> and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-campaign-chief-breitbart\">\u201cLeni Riefenstahl [a Nazi propagandist] of the Tea Party movement\u201d</a>.</p> <p>To gain clarity following yet another Trump campaign shakeup, I read Breitbart exclusively for two days, eschewing all other news sources. (The Guardian included. Apart from its soccer coverage.)</p> <p>It offered an insight into not just the popularity of Breitbart \u2013 the site boasted <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/08/07/blow-breitbart-news-sets-traffic-records-july-192-million-pageviews-31-million-uniques-89-million-visits/\">31 million unique visitors</a> in July \u2013 but also how it appeals to its readers. And it\u2019s not as straightforward as you might imagine.</p> <p>The first thing you notice when visiting Breitbart is its idiosyncratic presentation. Every headline is in capitals. It implies a sense of significance and dire urgency. </p> <p>It screams at you. \u201cTHIS IS IMPORTANT,\u201d is the effect. \u201cTHIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.\u201d \u201cTHIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS COUNTRY GOING TO HELL IN A HANDCART.\u201d</p> <p>The last of those points is an example of how well Breitbart knows its audience. </p> <p>This doomsday approach makes it seem like Breitbart readers want to feel that everything is rotten. They want to feel irate. They want to feel that disaster is impending \u2013 unless their guys can fix it.</p> <p>But compared to the caps-lock screaming, the actual articles are quite benign. They could have been published on a liberal news site. Look at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/08/17/mook-only-fitting-for-a-bully-like-trump-to-hire-a-bully-to-run-his-campaign/\">this one from Wednesday</a>, reporting on the response of Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, to Bannon being hired by the Trump campaign.</p> <p>\u201cMook: \u2018Only Fitting For a Bully Like Trump To Hire a Bully To Run His Campaign\u2019,\u201d it reads.</p> <p>Mook did say that. It\u2019s true. The article itself is opinion-free. It could appear on the Guardian. It merely quotes Mook directly. <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/17/clinton-campaign-denounces-breitbart-news-divisive-racist-anti-muslim-anti-semitic-donald-trump-hires-steve-bannon/\">A later article on the same subject</a> quoted Mook more extensively, then included a response from Breitbart at the bottom. That\u2019s essentially what any news site would have done.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say Breitbart is objective. It just pushes its rightwing message with a surprising subtlety. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-steve-bannon/\">An extensive profile of Bannon</a> by Bloomberg Politics reveals some of that thinking. \u201cFacts get shares, opinions get shrugs,\u201d Bannon says. And that\u2019s mostly how it works.</p> <p>On the front page, at least, Breitbart presents readers with articles it knows will make them angry. The Mook article is a prime example \u2013 it gives readers an outlet to rip into liberal politicians and liberal media. </p> <p>If Breitbart\u2019s success is from publishing articles that it knows will upset its readers, the key is to publish the stories that present the perfect combination of facts to fuel rightwing anger. For example, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/19/busy-schedule-dhs-secretary-defends-obamas-absence-louisiana/\">story about homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson</a>, who visited Louisiana following the recent floods, saying Obama could not also attend because he has a \u201cvery busy schedule\u201d. It is true \u2013 he did say that. But the article is illustrated with a picture of a smiling Obama on a golf course, and the text notes the president is \u201con vacation\u201d. </p> <p>For all the veneer of objectivity, readers are only presented with stories that further rightwing narratives. Reading it for two days, I learned a number of things I never knew. Many of them about Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>I discovered that \u201ca number of recent stories have focused on questions about Clinton\u2019s health\u201d.</p> <p>According to articles presented by Breitbart, Clinton is tired and ailing. In <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/18/trump-visits-louisiana-flood-victims-as-hillary-rests-and-obama-vacations/\">a piece about flooding</a> in Louisiana, I learned that Clinton needs \u201cextensive rest over the weekends\u201d. </p> <p>From <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/17/dr-drew-gravely-concerned-hillary-clintons-health-care/\">one headline</a>, I learned that Dr Drew \u2013 VH1\u2019s resident celebrity doctor \u2013 is \u201cgravely concerned about her health care\u201d. </p> <p>The message is clear: Clinton is the elderly grandmother who comes round for tea and biscuits and then has to be driven home when she falls asleep in front of Jeopardy. </p> <p>Apart from Clinton\u2019s troubling health, I learned that there was a \u201cnew gun control idea\u201d. The idea, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/08/18/researcher-use-gun-violence-restraining-orders-confiscate-guns-older-citizens/\">according to the Breitbart headline</a>, is to \u201ctake away guns from senior citizens\u201d.</p> <p> The story is actually presented straight. After an examination of the quotes, however, which came from an academic at Johns Hopkins University, the article didn\u2019t match the bluster of the headline.</p> <p>We don\u2019t exactly know what to expect yet from the Bannon-led Trump campaign.

While the research in the EHRC report certainly requires detailed examination, it is important to note that, alongside areas of concern, there are also figures indicating significant progress.</p> <p>Black and minority ethnic people are, according to the Law Society and the General Medical Council, more likely to have jobs in prestigious professions such as law and medicine as a proportion of the UK population, although there are concerns about reaching the highest levels in these professions. Children of families of Indian and Chinese origin are the highest school achievers. Children from black and minority ethnic groups are more likely to go to independent schools and, according to recent figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, are also more likely to go to university.</p> <p>Moreover, there is a need to move beyond the categories used in research in this area, which can serve more to obscure than to illuminate. As research from the Institute for Public Policy Research, for example, has shown, there are often wide disparities between the economic progress and wellbeing of groups within categories such as \u201cblack people\u201d and \u201cminority ethnic people\u201d that feature in your report. Significant differences across education, health and employment have been demonstrated, for example, between families with origins in India and Bangladesh, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia.

Burroughs was trying to become the fourth US wrestler with multiple Olympic golds.</p> <p>Geduev jumped to a 3-0 lead in a match stopped several times so officials could clean a cut on Burroughs\u2019s head. Burroughs scored a late takedown, but it was not enough to overcome the deficit.</p> <p>Burroughs, a three-time world champion and the winner from the London Games in 2012, can still claim a bronze medal through the repechage after Geduev qualified for the finals.</p> <p>It was that victory in London combined with his charismatic, social media-friendly persona that helped make Burroughs the face of wrestling as the sport fought to return to the Olympic program in 2013.</p> <p>Burroughs, a New Jersey native who starred for the University of Nebraska, won the world title again in 2013. He was forced to settle for bronze in 2014 after hurting his knee in the opening match.</p> <p>Burroughs returned to handily win the world championships in Las Vegas in 2015, and his dominant performance at the Olympic trials in April made it seem as though no one could touch him in Rio. He was so confident that he told the Associated Press in July that he planned to bring his gold medal from London to Rio so he could wear two of them to his post-Rio news conference. His Twitter handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alliseeisgold\">@alliseeisgold</a>.</p> <p>But from the moment Burroughs hit the mat on Friday, it just did not seem like his day.</p> <p>Burroughs came out attacking in his first match, scoring on an early takedown to seize control of his opening match against Guinea Bissau\u2019s Augusto Midana.</p> <p>Burroughs led 8-2 at the break and won 8-3 though it was unusual to see Burroughs give up multiple scores to such an unaccomplished opponent.</p> <p>Geduev and Burroughs nearly came to blows just seconds into their match, as Geduev shoved Burroughs hard in the shoulders after Burroughs objected to a head slap by nearly slapping the Russian.</p> <p>Geduev scored first and made point-scoring moves difficult for Burroughs. Geduev padded his lead with a pair of second-period pushouts, and Burroughs found himself on the mat trying to come to grips with a loss that dropped his international record to 130-3.</p> <p>Geduev will face Iran\u2019s Hassan Yazdanicharati for the gold at 74kg.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">resignation of Paul Manafort</a> as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman was inevitable after details of his highly paid ties to the pro-Russian former Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html\">became public</a> at the start of this week. On Friday, Mr Manafort\u2019s departure was confirmed. Even in a presidential campaign in which Mr Trump had appeared aggressively unconcerned about his reputation as the Kremlin\u2019s preferred candidate \u2013 and in which he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">called on Russia</a> to hack and publish Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2013 this was an embarrassment too far.</p> <p>Yet the resignation cannot simply be put down even to the red faces caused by charges of Moscow gold at the heart of the Republican campaign. Mr Trump has got where he is by scorning, not following, the usual rules. The difference now is that he is getting towards the business end of the presidential campaign, and it\u2019s going badly. Attacks that seemed to leave no dent in Mr Trump\u2019s armour a few weeks ago, have now begun to leave plenty. The polls have been tipping Mrs Clinton\u2019s way. If Mr Trump seriously wanted to salvage his campaign, he had to act.</p> <p>Yet it is far too early to say that the way he has so far shaken up his campaign \u2013 which partly preceded the departure of Mr Manafort anyway \u2013 marks a change of direction. There has been lots of media talk about a \u201cpivot\u201d towards a more presidential tone and a more consistent appeal to centre-ground voters. Yet little that Mr Trump has said or done since winning the Republican nomination in Cleveland in July points in that direction. On the contrary, his campaign appearances have continued to rely on the brutally populist campaign of the past. This is precisely why so many Republicans, including sitting senators, members of Congress and dozens of officials in former Republican administrations, have turned against him.</p> <p>Mr Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">apologised for some of his language and attacks</a> in a speech on Thursday night in North Carolina. But he was totally unspecific about what he was apologising for. Among many other things, he has taunted other Republicans, called Barack Obama the founder of Islamic State, hinted that gun-owners could shoot Mrs Clinton, boasted about his anatomy, insulted Latinos, immigrants, women and, most recently, abused the Muslim-American family of a dead US soldier. In the past, Mr Trump has confessed to using such language to create campaign momentum. If he genuinely proposes to alter course, it will take more than one very general speech in order to prove it.</p> <p>When Mr Trump started shaking up his campaign a few days ago, there was little sign that he was taking a new tack either. If anything, the signs were the opposite. His new chief executive is a man of the hard right, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-campaign-chief-breitbart\">Stephen Bannon</a>. He is being prepped for the TV debates with Mrs Clinton by Roger Ailes, who quit as chair of Fox News amid allegations of sexual harassment. If anything, it was Mr Manafort who was one of the strongest advocates of a pivot to the centre, not them. The changes may actually increase not reduce the chances that Mr Trump will continue to shoot from the hip. Mr Trump will do anything it takes to win, another <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/teddyschleifer/status/766652473121603584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">former Trump strategist said yesterday</a>.

He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In simple terms, HM is \u201cmonetary financing of fiscal spending\u201d, a central bank who prints money for its government to spend; a practice definitely not included in the Bundesbank\u2019s instruction manual. However, we should keep an open mind after all - Mario Draghi sees it as a \u201cvery interesting concept\u201d and Loretta Mester from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland considers it a possible \u201cnext step if \u2026 we wanted to be more accommodative\u201d.</p> <p>It is therefore important that we analyse, in simple terms, how HM could work. The first step would be to assess whether this type of monetary financing is allowed under current laws and regulations. In most jurisdictions, rules exist and limit the actions of a central bank.</p> <p>Examples include Article 123 of the Treaty of Lisbon (EU), Article 5 of the Fiscal Act (Japan) and the Treasury Fed Accord of 1951 (US). However, loopholes and safe harbour clauses are easy to identify as most central banks are allowed to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to fulfil their mandate. </p> <p>In practice, the central bank would deliver money to the treasury by receiving a meaningless asset (i.e. a zero coupon perpetual bond) in exchange, or \u2013 preferably - without any quid pro quo agreement. In either case, there would be no planned reimbursement for the sums extended. It is important that \u2013 at least for some time \u2013 this money creation is seen as permanent and irreversible, to avoid creating fears of challenging times ahead, and the associated desire to save, not spend or invest. </p> <p>The more orthodox central bankers have nothing to fear as they would be in the driving seat.

These are anaemic aggregate demand, persistence of excess supply and a growing social inequality. Any HM initiative must be dedicated to projects that aim to cure these.</p> <p>It should help the majority of households by increasing their welfare and enhancing their disposable income, fostering confidence and promoting consumer spending, in order to benefit the majority of the population rather than enrich asset-holders by inflating financial asset prices. There could also be spending on long-term themes like education, and on structural issues strangling the economy, such as the banking\u2019s sector non-performing assets. </p> <p>We need a fiscal plan that aims to generate real prosperity without incurring public indebtedness, or offsetting its benefits with fears of a gloomier future in which debts must be repaid. It should also attempt to create inflation expectations, and trigger higher interest rates. While higher borrowing costs would mean weaker businesses would not survive, the profitability of the banking sector would be enhanced and insurance companies would receive crucial support. Perhaps, this policy could also lower the liabilities of defined benefit pension funds. Ultimately, inflation is the only solution to today\u2019s global debt problem. Some inflation would reduce the real value of the accumulated debt.</p> <p>All this considered, the question is how much money should be created and spent? The calibration of an HM policy would be much easier than that of QE. While QE relies on an uncertain transmission mechanism, whether banks will lend more or hoard the additional cash, the multiplier effect of HM is easier to forecast. </p> <p>Only once the growth and inflation objectives are reached, would an exit policy be publicly discussed.

July is usually the second highest month for receipts during the financial year, reflecting the timing of corporation tax and self-assessment (SA) payments.<br></p> <p>2) The underlying reason for the slightly smaller surplus than last year was that the 2.2 per cent growth in central government accrued receipts (excluding APF transfers) was slower than the 4.2 per cent growth in central government spending (excluding grants to local authorities). <strong>The rise in central government spending mostly reflected growth in departmental spending</strong>. Growth in central government receipts was depressed by weak income tax receipts, although this partly reflects timing effects as the first self-assessment (SA) payment deadline fell on a weekend this year.<br></p> <p>3) <strong>Meeting our March <em>EFO</em> forecast for PSNB in 2016-17 would require it to fall by \u00a319.8 billion over the full financial year. A third of the way through the financial year, PSNB was only \u00a33.0 billion lower than last year.</strong> While prospects for the rest of the year are subject to greater uncertainty than usual due to the result of the EU referendum, it is still worth noting that receipts and spending data are volatile from month to month and prone to revision, especially at this relatively early stage of the year.<br></p> <p>4) <strong>However, despite these timing effects, there is still evidence that growth in PAYE, NICs and stamp duty land tax (SDLT) was slower in the first four months of the year than would be required to meet our March forecast for the year as a whole.</strong> July\u2019s data cover the first full month since the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU, but a very substantial proportion of the data in this month\u2019s release is either a forecast or still reflects economic activity prior to the referendum.

That would indicate that the economy was motoring along pretty well.</p> <p>A poor reading, though, might reignite concerns that growth is slowing - despite the moderate price pressures, low unemployment and strong consumer spending reported this week.</p> <p>And a quick truffle through this morning\u2019s research notes show that analysts are a little concerned.</p> <p>Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics expects to be underwhelmed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first post-referendum set of public borrowing figures look set to be disappointing.

  "<p>So, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/ryan-lochte-olympics-rio-us-media-dumbest-bell\">Ryan Lochte</a> the International Olympic Committee finally has its poster boy. Nothing says \u201cIOC, bitch!\u201d like landing in a host city, extracting personal glory from it, partying it up and then leaving the place more broken and out of pocket than you found it.

The politics of the tall tale Lochte and his swim team bros spun the media about being robbed in Brazil, to disguise their drunken criminal damage, is almost too obvious to state. An economically struggling city, whose people made it vocally clear the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/04/rio-olympics-brazil-politics-zika-virus\">Olympics were unwelcome</a>, has spent much of its hosting period being dug at for failing to provide the five-star international tourist experience and immaculate security that today\u2019s modern Olympic tourist demands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5118e337994a661673abe830b951bd4f729b9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5118e337994a661673abe830b951bd4f729b9c9/312_344_1738_1042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Lochte shows his taste for gold as part of the US men\u2019s 4x200m team in Rio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Lochte shows his taste for gold as part of the US men\u2019s 4x200m team in Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Getz/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this sensitive climate, Lochte &amp; Co claiming to have been robbed by gun-toting pretend police officers underscores the idea the host city is a semi-lawless backwater where no one is safe.

Sometimes you make decisions you later regret. They had fun, they made a mistake, life goes on.\u201d (Apparently unsatiated by the exposure of Lochte\u2019s lie, one high-profile US commentator is calling for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeithOlbermann/status/766302794773106688\">Andrada to resign</a>, which feels like a rather poor show.)</p> <p>I hardly presume to say that the antics of Lochte and his more junior swim team buddies is what white privilege looks like, being similarly blessed myself, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any possible other explanation. And for that reason, we just know Ryan is going to get away with it. To watch the outraged commentators attempting to lay a glove on him is to imagine them doggy-paddling in the wake of his best freestyle time.</p> <p>Before the Games began, Ryan Lochte\u2019s post-Olympics plans consisted of moving to Los Angeles to become a celebrity. \u201cI see me being a designer,\u201d he mused. \u201cI see me being a model, I see me being a TV star.\u201d</p> <p>However much some may wish it to be different, I see none of these things being very much affected by his actions in Rio. After all, the self-styled civilised first world is the place where almost innumerable professional idiots have whole lucrative TV shows devoted to the comings and goings of their lives. It\u2019s what sets us apart from the animals, as I understand it.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t the point about people like Lochte that they get away with it? No matter how satisfying this story may superficially feel to all those who have loathed Lochte\u2019s frat bro persona since for ever, and who feel that this is somehow a comeuppance or him being found out in some cathartic way \u2013 it isn\u2019t.

On Wednesday, after news of yet another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">campaign shakeup</a>, I wondered if his supporters had started to see the beginning of the end. So I headed to Trump Bar, a rare refuge of Trumpism in liberal Manhattan, to find out if they were drowning their sorrows.<br></p> <p>Though the midtown sky was robin\u2019s egg blue, inside the dark bar on the ground floor of Trump Tower, near Central Park, a pair of polo-shirted tourists on barstools were watching dark clouds gather on the television screen tuned to the weather station. \u201cA storm\u2019s coming,\u201d one said to the other, sipping a whisky soda. The other man grunted. Happy hour at the Trump Bar, I discovered, was neither happy nor an hour. The daily promotion stretched from 4-7pm; the clientele was anxious.</p> <p>Andy, a young man who wore his black baseball cap backwards, polo shirt white and cargo shorts baggy, was staring into his phone. Andy was from Minnesota. This was his first time in New York. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen much,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the 9/11 [memorial] and then I came here.\u201d Beside him sat a half-empty bottle of Brooklyn Sorachi Ace, two camouflage Make America Great Again hats he had purchased from the Trump store, and a pile of Trump-Pence bumper stickers. \u201cYeah, I support Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95e52fed0c8bbc8f7756619286ae14b60f2abef3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95e52fed0c8bbc8f7756619286ae14b60f2abef3/0_47_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honey Heil and Marie Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honey Heil and Marie Smith.

We\u2019re not here to talk. Tell him \u2018no comment\u2019.\u201d \u201cNo comment,\u201d said Andy. Trump supporters appeared to follow the same media strategy as their candidate: don\u2019t answer questions you don\u2019t like \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-calls-reporter-ewan-macaskill-a-nasty-nasty-guy-video\">shut them out</a> instead.</p> <p>During happy hour, wine is $6 a glass, draught beer is $5 and cocktails are $7. But none of the signature or classic cocktails (The Billionaire Martini, $20; the Boardroom, $17; and the \u201cYou\u2019re Fired\u201d, $15) are included.</p> <p>June Smith, 70, was content with her wine. Smith was visiting New York from State College, Pennsylvania \u2013 part of what she calls the \u201cRed T\u201d of the Keystone State. She was optimistic that Trump would defeat Clinton in the election, despite his week of bad press. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d she told me. \u201cUsually Pennsylvania is blue but this election it\u2019s purple!\u201d (I refrained from informing her most polls find Clinton with a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">4- to 11-point lead over </a>Trump there.) I asked what she liked about Trump. \u201cHe gets it,\u201d she explained. But her gruff son-in-law, who told me his name was \u201cForget About Me\u201d, quickly interrupted. \u201cNo more talking,\u201d he said. Smith smiled apologetically and reached for the sandwich. I grabbed my beer and wandered off.</p> <p>I soon came across a a quartet of ladies from Savannah, Georgia, who had settled into four chairs opposite Andy and his friend. One, Honey Heil, 74, was a vivacious and vociferous Trump supporter. Andy gave her a campaign bumper sticker, which she proudly attached to her shirt. \u201cLook, Donald! We\u2019re here!\u201d she crowed enthusiastically.<br></p> <p>Heil, a retired school nurse, was undeterred by Trump\u2019s so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4447985/inside-donald-trump-meltdown/\">meltdown</a>\u201d. She excitedly laid out a strategy to bring women \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/190403/seven-women-unfavorable-opinion-trump.aspx\">a demographic that has proven difficult</a> for him to win over. \u201cI can\u2019t believe girls are for Clinton! Put out the navy blue dress!\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll go ding-dong!\u201d Her friend, Marie Smith, was equally enthusiastic about the Trump-Pence ticket. \u201cWhat about Pence?\u201d she said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he just look like a VP?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As soon as Donald is president he\u2019ll be surrounded by the best and the brightest</p> <footer> <cite>Honey Heil</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Their companion, a woman who wore all denim and asked not to be named, was voting for Trump for national security. \u201cGod wants us to be safe,\u201d she told me. \u201cDonald is the one who knows how to keep us safe.\u201d </p> <p>Smith said she was voting for Trump for economic reasons. \u201cI see Clinton\u2019s side of things but it\u2019s in my interest to vote Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy should my husband, who owns a small business, have to pay for other people who don\u2019t even have jobs?\u201d But she thought some of Trump\u2019s more outrageous proposals were more smoke than fire.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever get a wall,\u201d she said. Heil, however, was more full-throated in her support. \u201cI want a wall that goes 6 feet down and 10 feet up! It\u2019ll get done!\u201d Asked how Trump could possibly execute such an ambitious project, she just shrugged: \u201cAs soon as Donald is president he\u2019ll be surrounded by the best and the brightest.\u201d</p> <p>Three hours into my visit, most of the bar had pretty much emptied and happy hour had ended \u2013 but the ladies from Savannah didn\u2019t seem to mind.

Even some major supermarket chains, like Sainsbury\u2019s, which would have welcomed a ban on 2-for-1 junk food deals, have complained that Britain now needs compulsory targets for the reduction of sugar across the food and drinks industry. Its chief executive, Mike Coupe, says: \u201cNothing less will work.\u201d</p> <p>So why, confronted by her first big choice, has May gone with the lobbyists for big business, rather than the public health lobby?

  "<h2>FRIDAY NIGHT AND THE LIGHTS ARE LOW</h2> <p>And so it is with huge fanfare that football on a Friday night begins, except we can\u2019t just refer to it as \u201cfootball on a Friday night\u201d, because \u201cfootball on a Friday night\u201d incorporates neither unnecessary capitals nor unnecessary acronym, and how else to assert requisite IMPORTANCE and HYPE? Thus did the nation\u2019s smartest branding brains simply look at America, see what they did, and copy it, concocting the incredibly catchy Friday Night Football, FNF for short. How do they even think of these things? <br></p> <p>Not everyone is happy about this new institution. For some, getting to the game is a problem and for others the game at that time of the week just isn\u2019t what\u2019s done because it\u2019s not what was ever done (apart from when it was). Moreover, it also frees up Saturday and Sunday for the being of normal, and who could possibly want that? On the other hand, those in favour see a perfect start to the weekend: a night game which removes the yoke of football from other weekend festivities, even if it does free up Saturday and Sunday for the being of normal, and who could possibly want that? </p> <p>And if things weren\u2019t already special enough, tonight will see the presentation of the season\u2019s first and most prestigious trophy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/19/paul-pogba-manchester-united-southampton-premier-league\">in honour of Manchester United\u2019s triumphant transfer window</a>; the glory, glory days of the Lord Ferg era are surely back at Old Trafford. Quite what the man himself makes of it all no one quite knows, but chances are that with Rafael and Ji-Sung Park unavailable, he will concede that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho had no choice but to resort to Paul Pogba. Either way, selling him for \u00a30 and buying him back for \u00a393m, as the most expensive player of all-time, represents a coup of quite staggering audacity. </p> <p>But for sure no one else at Old Trafford minds, thanks to Pogba\u2019s footballing genius at being marketable, a highlight-reel hero of the selfie generation. Adidas are excited, Nissin Noodles are excited and Mr Potato is carnally excited; why else would a football club exist? Rumours abound that Pogba is actually quite good at doing things which aren\u2019t having haircuts, earning money and scoring amazing goals, but it\u2019s impossible to circumvent stereotype and attention span to find out.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Rob Smyth for minute-by-minute coverage of Manchester United 1-0 Southampton at 8pm UK time. </a></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cWhat happened is I hit a pillar - that\u2019s the reality.

He espouses views that are both potentially dangerous and demonstrably false. For example, as we reported in this story, Roberts continues to argue that Nasa has manipulated temperature data in collaboration with every other relevant science agency including the UK Met Office and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. <br></p> <p>Normally, these views would simply not be reported. But as an elected parliamentarian, it is important that he is scrutinised and understood by the public. The ABC put him on the panel, but had Brian Cox on as well, who was well-equipped to refute some of what Roberts said. <br></p> <p>In the future, as Roberts continues to make demonstrably false claims, the Guardian and other media outlets will need to think carefully about how much attention to give him.

  "<p>I lived in Syria until 2012, when I was 25. There was a lot of bombing in Damascus \u2013 most of the time it was hard for us to get to work as we couldn\u2019t get out of our houses. The company I was working for in aviation services opened a branch in Cairo, so I moved. Being gay was a factor in wanting to leave. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/flatmates-of-gay-syrian-refugee-beheaded-in-turkey-fear-they-will-be-next\">forbidden to be gay</a> in Syria.</p> <p>I was in Cairo for just under four years. I liked it at the beginning, but from the second half of 2013 there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/09/egypt-police-raid-cairo-bath-house\">crackdown</a> on the LGBT community \u2013 Egyptians were imprisoned and foreigners were deported. At the moment there are over 250 people in jail there because they are homosexual.</p> <p>I left my company because of a professional disagreement, and started working at a call centre, while waiting for my new work permit to come through. It was then I discovered I\u2019m HIV positive \u2013 to get a work permit in Egypt you need to prove you\u2019re HIV negative \u2013 so I was fired. I lived on savings, then started depending on friends and any jobs I was able to get; a translator, a tourist guide, whatever I could find.</p> <p>The oppression in Egypt made it impossible to meet people; you just couldn\u2019t trust that someone wasn\u2019t an informer. Mostly my LGBT friends and I stayed home. If we were meeting friends and someone was late, we would call and check reports to see if anyone had been picked up. I couldn\u2019t see a future there.</p> <p>I contacted <a href=\"http://rainbowrailroad.ca/\">Rainbow Railroad</a>, an organisation that helps LGBT people escape persecution, and they accepted my case. A little over a year after I first applied I opened my emails and saw the word \u201cCongratulations\u201d. I didn\u2019t believe it. I started jumping while sitting; it must have looked hilarious. My friend said, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to Canada!\u201d</p> <p>I landed on 26 May, five days before <a href=\"http://www.pridetoronto.com/pride-month/\">Pride Month</a> started on 1 June. It felt significant, and overwhelming. I kept thinking: \u201cAm I allowed to do this?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/12/one-person-picket-fran-death-protests-greenham-common\">\u2018I made a one-person picket\u2019: Fran De\u2019Ath protests at Greenham Common</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I heard from Rainbow Railroad that Justin Trudeau would be at the march on 3 July. Early on, I realised there were only about 10 people between me and him. I thought, \u201cI need to reach him.\u201d I wanted to thank him for the opportunity to be here and be free. When I reached his side, I thought, \u201cNow what?\u201d Working up the courage to talk to him took an hour. I was thinking, \u201cShould I call him Mr Trudeau? Mr Prime Minister? Justin?\u201d In the end I said, \u201cUuuuh\u2026 I just want to thank you for everything. I\u2019m Syrian. I arrived here a month ago.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t thank me.

  "<p>In October 1999, Nate Parker, a Penn State student and promising young wrestler, called one of his coaches in a fit. A woman he\u2019d had sex with several months before had just described the encounter as rape, and Parker sensed that trouble was brewing. </p> <p>Parker would later recall that the coach advised him to stay calm. \u201cThese things come up from time to time,\u201d the coach reassured him, \u201cwith girls who feel guilty about what they did.\u201d</p> <p>It was the start of a conflict that would rage for nearly two years on Penn State\u2019s campus and has come roaring back into view now that Parker is embarking on a publicity tour for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/the-birth-of-a-nation-review-sundance-slavery-epic-as-brutal-as-braveheart\">a new film</a>, The Birth of a Nation. The film, which depicts the Nat Turner slave rebellion, has garnered feverish praise and fetched a record price after it premiered at the Sundance film festival. </p> <p>Parker directed and stars in the film. A second former student whom the woman accused of rape, Jean Celestin, has a writing credit. But the old accusations are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/16/birth-of-a-nation-film-nate-parker-rape-trial\">threatening to swamp the film\u2019s publicity tour</a> and are dredging up questions about the two men\u2019s accountability.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/17/the-birth-of-nation-posters-nate-parker-rape-trial\">The Birth of a Nation posters defaced after Nate Parker rape trial controversy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Long before the claims played out in the Hollywood press, the accusations led to a trial, in which Parker was acquitted. Celestin was convicted of sexual assault, only for the verdict to be thrown out. Along the way, Penn State was plunged into a toxic brew of victim-blaming and racial hostility. Parker and Celestin are black; their accuser was white.</p> <p>But as tensions cleaved members of campus, accounts from that time suggest that one major player seemed to keep out of the controversy: Penn State itself. </p> <p>Acting typically for a university of the time, recalled one anti-rape activist, the institution stayed apart from the conflict even as individual members of the administration aligned behind Parker and Celestin. The accuser received an especially cold shoulder, she would later claim, until critics of the university believed it was too late.</p> <p>By the time the trial concluded, in 2000, both Parker and his accuser had fled campus. Parker said things were too uneasy on campus. His accuser blamed daily harassment by Parker and Celestin\u2019s supporters. Celestin, who was briefly convicted of sexual assault and remained on campus, said he was hounded by racist death threats.</p> <p>In 2012, the woman at the center of the case <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/nate-parkers-accuser-committed-suicide-in-2012-her-brother-speaks-out-exclusive-1201838508/\">committed suicide</a>. Her life\u2019s terminus was a halfway house where she was treated for mental health issues related to an alleged sexual assault and addiction.</p> <h2>August 1999</h2> <p>It began over the summer. Parker and Celestin\u2019s accuser went to the two men\u2019s apartment the night of 20 August 1999. At trial, different witnesses <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/16/inside-the-nate-parker-rape-case.html\">testified</a> that she was noticeably drunk or extremely drunk when she walked in the door, although Parker and Celestin would later insist she had been sober. </p> <p>In the accuser\u2019s telling, she promptly fell asleep, and she woke up to Parker raping her. Later, she determined Celestin had had sex with her when she was unconscious. In Parker and Celestin\u2019s accounts, she invited the two of them into Parker\u2019s bedroom for sex. A third man who was in the apartment at the time testified at trial that the woman appeared motionless while Parker had sex with her. In his discomfort, he left the scene.</p> <p>The woman told police her account in October, and by the end of the month, the Centre County prosecutor had charged Parker and Celestin with rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, sexual assault and indecent assault. Both pleaded not guilty. Two key pieces of evidence would be a secretly recorded phone call with the woman in which Parker and Celestin acknowledged having sex with her and the statement of a doctor who examined the woman for abdominal pain and saw possible signs of trauma in her cervix. </p> <p>The university suspended the two men from the wrestling team. But the campus at large was starting to show its support. Members of the student black caucus accused law enforcement of racially motivated policing. The campus newspaper wrote sympathetically about the tough year the wrestling team faced without two of its stars. \u201cI just want to make sure they\u2019re OK,\u201d Kerry McCoy, the assistant wrestling coach, <a href=\"http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_9e64b15c-7098-588d-be3d-7b0bea5eac59.html\">told the newspaper</a>, the Daily Collegian, \u201cand that they know they have a lot of support behind them.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the run-up to the trial, Parker and Celestin \u2013 both of whom attended Penn State on wrestling scholarships \u2013 continued to attend class and, more distressingly for their accuser, endured no restrictions on their ability to move about campus. That included the entrance to her dorm.</p> <p>In a lawsuit she would file against Penn State in 2002, the woman said the university had the ability to shield her from Parker and Celestin but failed. Parker, she said, frequently \u201cstationed himself\u201d outside her building. She claimed he, Celestin and their friends harassed her, and she complained to school administrators repeatedly. In reaction to harassing phone calls, she sought to remove her phone number and address from the campus directory. Her information nonetheless appeared in the next printing.</p> <p>Penn State said the accusations in the lawsuit were \u201cunfounded\u201d.</p> <p>The lawsuit also claimed that Parker and Celestin hired a private investigator who showed an enlarged photo of her around campus, hoping to learn unflattering details.</p> <p>But as the criminal investigation churned along, the woman claimed, her mental health began to deteriorate. She twice tried to commit suicide within about a month of Parker and Celestin\u2019s arrest. By the end of the fall semester, she had dropped out of school entirely.</p> <h2>The criminal trial</h2> <p>Supporters of Celestin and Parker had other ideas of what might have happened. The assistant wrestling coach, McCoy, allegedly suggested to Parker that the accuser could have made up a story to avoid her parents\u2019 anger that she was pregnant with a black man\u2019s child. (The accuser briefly faked a pregnancy scare in a phone call with Parker.) </p> <p>As members of the campus black caucus watched the episode unfold, they claimed to see signs that the investigation and prosecution were racially motivated. <br></p> <p>Parker <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/16/inside-the-nate-parker-rape-case.html\">claimed</a> one of the police investigators said to him: \u201cYou wrestlers for the past 10 years have raped and battered this whole town. I\u2019m going to get you.\u201d The jury selected to hear the trial was entirely white save for one black woman. With a jury like that, a member of the campus black caucus <a href=\"http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_cd1bc083-0e37-59a1-87e3-721802eacd10.html\">asked the Daily Collegian</a>: \u201cDo you really think a black male of color, who is accused of raping a white female in Centre County, can get a fair trial?\u201d</p> <p>At trial, though, the defense focused on undermining the victim and her supporting witnesses with questions about her outfit on the night in question, her drinking behavior, and which prescription drugs she might have mixed with alcohol. </p> <p>Several witnesses testified that on the night in question, the accuser had been highly intoxicated. But the defense implied she had a history of partying hard and could hold her liquor. A previous, consensual encounter between the woman and Parker cast further doubt on her story. And the jury appeared to have questions about the very meaning of consent, the Daily Beast <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/16/inside-the-nate-parker-rape-case.html\">reported</a>.</p> <p>After a three-day trial and a brief deliberation, the jury acquitted Parker of all charges against him, and convicted Celestin of sexual assault.</p> <p>In the wake of Celestin\u2019s conviction, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2001-11-29/news/25322001_1_graduation-ceremonies-diploma-bill-mahon\">his accuser felt certain</a> Penn State would bar him from campus. (Parker had long since transferred.) Instead, the administration declared its intentions to wait until Celestin received his sentence. Around 40 letters flooded the court vouching for Celestin\u2019s good nature, including one from the Penn State administrator who oversaw the school\u2019s disciplinary office.</p> <p>Another came from Terrell Jones, the vice-provost for educational equity. \u201cI think he comes from a good family,\u201d Jones <a href=\"http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_477d9f73-471e-5f98-b2fd-87c362c44fd8.html\">said at the time</a>. \u201cFrom what I know about him as a person, it\u2019s very positive.\u201d (Jones died in 2014.)</p> <p>Positive sketches of Celestin achieved their purpose. Under the state\u2019s sentencing guidelines, Celestin could expect to serve three to six years in a state prison. But, citing the letters, Judge Tom Kistler sentenced him instead to serve six to 12 months in county prison. </p> <p>When a state superior court later forced Kistler to impose a harsher sentence,<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_b7c8e262-66f4-5e32-b00f-f184a9ed0da2.html\">Kistler expressed regret</a>. \u201cThe facts are, he was involved [in the assault] for a minute or two, and will spend two to four years in prison,\u201d Kistler said.</p> <p>After the sentencing, <a href=\"http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_fc211b4b-29cf-53aa-b04f-c6edcacd3ea7.html\">national pressure</a> rained down on Penn State to prevent Celestin from finishing his degree and attending graduation. Black organizations on campus and at the state level <a href=\"http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_cd1bc083-0e37-59a1-87e3-721802eacd10.html\">objected</a>. In the end, Penn State barred Celestin from campus for two years, at which time he could return.</p> <p>The accuser\u2019s lawsuit ended quietly with an out-of-court settlement. Penn State paid her $17,500. The school also agreed to re-examine its sexual misconduct policies in cooperation with a panel of experts. </p> <p>The panel\u2019s chief recommendation was for Penn State to do everything in its power to keep victims of sexual assault in school. Penn State responded by immediately deriding the recommendations as a \u201csilly press release\u201d. In addition to making sexual assault resources available on its website, the school said, it had helped the accuser relocate to different housing. \u201cIt was a very shoddy report,\u201d the Penn State spokesman <a href=\"http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_0c50583d-79d5-5be9-b2a4-69862a616c6b.html\">told the Daily Collegian</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the poorest kind of reports I\u2019ve seen from my many years working at Penn State.\u201d</p> <p>It was around the same time Celestin\u2019s conviction was thrown out, due to ineffective counsel, and he was granted a new trial. But prosecutors had difficulties finding the original witnesses, and eventually they gave up on retrying the case.</p> <h2>Culture shifts at Penn State</h2> <p>S Daniel Carter, an anti-rape activist with the not-for-profit group Security on Campus, said many of the actions Penn State took \u2013 or failed to take \u2013 in the aftermath of the alleged victim\u2019s accusations are now against federal rules.</p> <p>For example, the measures that Penn State could have taken to eliminate contact between Parker and Celestin and their accuser today are a matter of law. Colleges no longer have broad abilities to delay their own investigation into an assault until the conclusion of a criminal trial, as Penn State did. And in the rare cases where colleges do delay, the administration is supposed to take singular measures to make sure the accuser is comfortable remaining on campus.</p> <p>Gone, too, said Carter, who supported the accuser during her ordeal, is the notion that the crime for which Celestin was briefly convicted wasn\u2019t as serious as \u201creal rape\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThose are the two biggest culture shifts, and cases like this one are the reason why things changed,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThe facts of this case were very common at the time. This was precisely the type of case that inspired the community of activists and advocates across the country to insist on changes.\u201d</p> <p>Carter is not the only one to have noticed a shift. In a recent interview with <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/nate-parkers-accuser-committed-suicide-in-2012-her-brother-speaks-out-exclusive-1201838508/\">Variety</a>, the accuser\u2019s brother said he believed she would be treated differently if her accusations were made today. \u201cI feel certain if this were to happen in 2016, the outcome would be different than it was,\u201d he said. \u201cCourts are a lot stricter about this kind of thing. You don\u2019t touch someone who is so intoxicated \u2013 period.\u201d</p> <p>Many<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>of the loudest voices on campus during Parker and Celestin\u2019s trial are now silent. Several former students reached by the Guardian did not return requests to comment or declined to speak, citing the many years that have elapsed since they were on campus.</p> <p>McCoy, the assistant wrestling coach, did not respond to requests to be interviewed. \u201cEverybody\u2019s moved on,\u201d McCoy recently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/16/inside-the-nate-parker-rape-case.html\">told the Daily Beast</a>.</p> <p>The Women\u2019s Law Project also declined to answer questions, citing the accuser\u2019s wish for anonymity.</p> <p>Celestin\u2019s accuser led a brief and difficult life after the trial. She sank into depression, periodically dropped out of contact with her family, and developed psychosis. In 2012, she was discovered dead in a halfway house, having swallowed nearly 200 sleeping pills.</p> <p>Her death certificate, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/nate-parkers-accuser-committed-suicide-in-2012-her-brother-speaks-out-exclusive-1201838508/\">obtained</a> by Variety, attributed her suicide to \u201cmajor depressive disorder with psychotic features, PTSD due to physical and sexual abuse, polysubstance abuse\u201d.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Fox Searchlight Pictures, which is distributing The Birth of a Nation, said Parker was not available for comment. But he has spoken out about this episode. \u201cI have never run from this period in my life and I never ever will,\u201d he said in a recent Facebook post<em tabindex=\"-1\">.</em> He maintains that his encounter with his accuser was completely consensual, and he says he takes sexual violence very seriously.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact [is] we are making moves and taking action to protect women on campuses and off campuses, and educating men and persecuting them when things come up,\u201d Parker said recently to Deadline Hollywood. \u201cI want women to stand up, to speak out when they feel violated, in every degree, as I prepare to take my own daughter to college.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Mazin Sidahmed</em></p>",
  "<p>If we needed a reminder of the importance of taking climate change seriously, the floods in Louisiana are providing a big one on a daily basis. When it comes to the big environmental issues, our country\u2019s polarization is historically unusual, and it\u2019s already gone way too far. That\u2019s why the latest fight to break out in Washington over climate issues needs more attention.<br></p> <p>On 1 August, the White House Council on Environmental Quality issued a non-binding suggestion, formally known as \u201cguidance\u201d, to federal agencies to think about climate change when making decisions under a law called the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa). What should have produced a shrug (or, hopefully, a cheer) caused a panic on the right that\u2019s only getting louder. <br></p> <p>Under Nepa, federal agencies have to account for the environmental impacts of taking major actions such as approving a mine permit, constructing or removing a dam or allowing a road near a protected habitat. These decisions are made by trained scientists and public servants with years of expertise and involve an unparalleled level of public input. By and large, they are among the most rigorously footnoted and well-supported decisions the federal government makes, and Nepa is one of the best vehicles the public has to express concerns about federal impacts on homes and communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/louisiana-flood-damage-recovery\">Louisiana left stunned by damage from '1,000-year' flood: 'It just kept coming'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The recent guidance suggests that federal agencies account for climate change in the Nepa process. If an agency were to follow the guidance in assessing the impacts of a new coal mine, for example, both the climate impacts of the mining operation itself and the climate impacts of burning the coal from the mine would be factored into the final Nepa analysis. </p> <p>If this strikes you less as an outrage and more as common sense, you\u2019re not alone. But you won\u2019t find many Washington Republicans agreeing with you. The chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, Rob Bishop, a Republican congressman from Utah, said of the document: \u201cYou can kiss energy independence goodbye.\u201d Republican senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the leading climate denier in Washington, issued a statement refusing to accept the guidance\u2019s validity, claiming in part: \u201c[G]lobal climate change falls outside of the scope of Nepa so the guidance has no legal basis.\u201d They were not alone. </p> <p>This kind of all-hands-on-deck resistance to a non-binding suggestion that agencies acknowledge climate change is a sign of the times, but it\u2019s also a sign that Republican leaders have made compromise on climate issues impossible. In throwing away a once proud environmental legacy, the party of Donald Trump \u2013 the party that makes oil drilling the centerpiece of its environmental agenda and insists that climate scientists are just ganging up on Exxon to enrich themselves \u2013 is forfeiting its seat at the table when climate policy is inevitably made down the line. </p> <p>Setting the politics aside, Nepa is the perfect vehicle for considering climate impacts from both a policy and scientific standpoint. The guidance suggests that agencies look not just at what climate impacts a project will have, but what impacts climate change will have on the project. If we know that climate change is making a coastal area more susceptible to devastating floods or combining with pollutants to worsen asthma in urban areas, the guidance says a federal agency should take that into consideration when planning for the future. </p> <p>That\u2019s not just sensible \u2013 it\u2019s necessary. Taxpayers of every political stripe want government agencies to consider all the facts, not just a politically approved subset of information, when deciding how federal money will be spent and which programs are working in the public interest. Pretending that climate change isn\u2019t real was politically expedient in the past. Today it\u2019s dangerous for millions of Americans, and it dooms the Republican Party to irrelevance in climate discussions. </p> <p>Willful ignorance serves no one in the real world. That\u2019s the world the guidance to federal agencies is about: the world where our nation\u2019s fishermen are finding their livelihoods upended by climate change, where whole states like California are facing historical levels of drought, where major wildfires are now standard front-page news. That\u2019s the world the American people live in. It\u2019s the world our government\u2019s decisions should reflect.</p>",
  "<p>Weeks before he died following a late-night confrontation with police, Dalian Atkinson picked up the phone to his former Aston Villa teammate Tony Daley.

Is that the stereotype that was applied? And if so, why? What threat was he? What de-escalation techniques were used? Why did it escalate to discharging a Taser potentially four times? These are the answers that people want.</p> <p>\u201cWe want a clear, open, transparent and rigorous investigation that provides answers and we no longer want to hear about lessons learned.

  "<p>The former publishers of the News of the World have failed in their attempt to overturn the \u00a3200,000 defamation victory secured by the Scottish politician Tommy Sheridan a decade ago.<br></p> <p>Judges at the court of session in Edinburgh rejected the appeal by News Group Newspapers (NGN) to set aside a 2006 civil jury verdict, which the then leader of the Scottish Socialist party won against the newspaper after it printed allegations about his sex life.</p> <p>Sheridan was subsequently convicted of perjury in 2010 following a police investigation, and served just over a year of his three-year prison sentence. The former MSP has always denied the allegations and launched an unsuccessful attempt to appeal against his conviction. </p> <p>NGN had argued in the court of session that the civil verdict was unsafe because of Sheridan\u2019s subsequent perjury conviction, but a written summary of opinion issued on Friday by Lady Paton, Lord Drummond Young and Lord McGhie said the reasoning of the 2006 jury had not been not undermined. </p> <p>The judgment read: \u201cIt was noted that the verdict of a civil jury should be treated with considerable respect. Current social standards were very much a jury question.</p> <p>\u201cThe jurors had heard and seen all the witnesses and the written evidence, and were the judges of the facts, deciding questions of credibility and reliability. The jurors would apply the directions in law given by the trial judge. </p> <p>\u201cThose directions included an instruction that if the jury found that some (but not all) of the allegations made against Mr Sheridan were proved, they still had to assess whether the unproved and unsubstantiated allegations materially injured Mr Sheridan\u2019s reputation.<br></p> <p>\u201cThus it was open to the jury to disbelieve some of Mr Sheridan\u2019s evidence, to find certain evidence led on behalf of NGN established, yet still to conclude that Mr Sheridan had been defamed. Several lines or routes of reasoning had been open to the civil jury, at least one of which was not undermined by the perjury conviction or by the three new items relied upon by NGN.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn that context, the court felt that certain material (unproved), which seemed to demonstrate unacceptable and possibly illegal conduct on the part of NGN\u2019s staff, should not be ignored. In the result, the civil jury\u2019s verdict and assessment of damages remain unaltered.\u201d <br></p> <p>A spokeswoman for News UK, of which NGN is a part, said: \u201cWe are disappointed by today\u2019s outcome of our appeal given Mr Sheridan\u2019s criminal conviction for perjury in giving his evidence to the court in the original libel trial. We are now considering all our options.\u201d</p> <p>In June 2015, the former editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson was cleared of perjury in the high court in Edinburgh after being charged with lying under oath about his knowledge of phone hacking when he appeared as a witness during Sheridan\u2019s 2010 trial.</p>",

It includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">records of $12.7m in payments allegedly designated for Paul Manafort</a>, then Yanukovych\u2019s chief consultant and election strategist and who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">on Friday resigned as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager</a>.<br></p> <p>Leshchenko said the records documented a $225,000 payment earmarked for King in return for the Azarov interview, which was broadcast by Ukraine\u2019s pro-government national TV station. \u201cMoney from the Party of Regions\u2019 shadow assets was paid to Larry King. He received $225,000 from the party\u2019s shadow coffer,\u201d the MP said, adding that the party had not paid taxes on its undercover slush fund. </p> <p>King, who left CNN in 2010 and has gone on to work for Russia Today, was not immediately available for comment. Manafort has dismissed claims he received \u201cblack ledger\u201d cash payments as \u201cunfounded, silly and nonsensical\u201d.</p> <p>Sources close to Manafort said he was not involved in flying King to Kiev. Rather, it was Azarov\u2019s own press team that came up with the \u201cstupid idea\u201d and arranged the trip, they suggested.</p> <p>But the alleged Larry King payment appears part of a wider strategy by the then ruling Party of Regions to influence US opinion and to deflect criticism of Yanukovych\u2019s increasingly authoritarian behaviour.</p> <p>The Associated Press <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c01989a47ee5421593ba1b301ec07813/ap-sources-manafort-tied-undisclosed-foreign-lobbying\">reported on Thursday</a> that Manafort\u2019s firm had run a covert Washington lobbying operation. Its goal was to win positive press coverage in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and to undercut public sympathy for the jailed Tymoshenko. At the time the EU and Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/11/yulia-tymoshenko-jailed-ukraine-pariah\">were calling for her to be freed.</a></p> <p>Between 2012 and 2014 Manafort\u2019s colleague Rick Gates directed two Washington lobbying firms, Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group, to set up meetings between senators and Ukrainian government officials, the AP said. The firms were paid $2.2m via a Brussels-based \u201cthinktank\u201d, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine.</p> <p>The \u201cblack ledger\u201d was found in the Party of Regions office in 2014, shortly after Yanukovych and Azarov escaped to Russia following mass anti-government protests. Ukrainian prosecutors accuse Yanukovych of being behind the shooting of 100 demonstrators and stealing $100bn. An international arrest warrant is outstanding against Azarov. </p> <p>On Friday, Leshchenko, a member of President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s parliamentary faction, said interrogating Manafort may shed light on the alleged secret payments. </p> <p>\u201cManafort didn\u2019t work for free in Ukraine. He served the Party of Regions for over 10 years.

This is not a casual relationship between the client and the performer. Such long-term cooperation incorporates a general worldview and values. Now voters in America will have to ask themselves: are these values they want in their country?\u201d</p> <p>The ledgers also suggest that Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions was giving clandestine funding to the far-right ultra-nationalist Ukrainian party Svoboda, Leshchenko said on Friday.

According to the policy adviser Karl Rove, he and George W Bush had an annual reading competition, averaging about two books a week, with Bush\u2019s taste extending from political biographies (he read 14 of Lincoln alone while he was in the White House) to fiction (including Camus\u2019 <em>The Stranger</em>) to YA (<em>Ana\u2019s Story</em>, co-written by his daughter Jenna). The bigger reader, though, was Laura Bush, a former school librarian, whose life is itself fictionalised in Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/16/american-stories-curtis-sittenfeld\"><em>American Wife</em></a>.</p> <p>Both Clintons\u2019 reading lists show that they are fans of Maya Angelou, but while Bill counts Hillary\u2019s <em>Living History</em> among his favourite political books, Hillary names George W Bush\u2019s <em>Decision Points</em> as hers.

He mocks her power naps and uses \u201clow energy\u201d as an insult, despite being obsessed with sleeping in his own bed, and often looking exhausted. And he slams Nato members for not paying their bills \u2013 when that\u2019s precisely what he\u2019s famous for in business.</p> <p>This, of course, is \u201cprojection\u201d, one of those Freudian terms we\u2019re supposed to reject for lack of scientific evidence, but that keeps reasserting itself as an invaluable way of interpreting the world. When we\u2019re troubled by a shameful emotion or half-acknowledged thought, this theory goes, we identify and condemn the failing in others, to avoid confronting it in ourselves. (It\u2019s not just that we <em>pretend</em> to see it in others, which is how people sometimes interpret Trump\u2019s sputterings; it\u2019s that we really believe it.) A cheating husband accuses his wife of infidelity; a bigot sees prejudice everywhere she looks. It works with positive emotions, too: in the first flush of romance, Carl Jung argued, projection runs the show; we see in the other person some good part of ourselves we\u2019ve yet to understand. That\u2019s why so many relationships flounder after a few months, once you start to notice the discrepancies between the real person and the projection. \u201cProjection,\u201d Jung wrote, \u201cchanges the world into the replica of one\u2019s unknown face.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/05/you-dont-have-choice-oliver-burkeman\">Maybe you don\u2019t have as much choice as you think</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tricky part is that projection usually attaches itself to something real in the other person\u2019s personality, making it hard to see what\u2019s going on. For example, I get enraged by drivers in my neighbourhood honking their horns for no good reason. In a sense, I\u2019m right: they\u2019re breaking the law. But that can\u2019t be the whole explanation, since I get nowhere near so emotional about other annoyances \u2013 frankly, I don\u2019t get so emotional about most terrorist attacks. Could it be that I\u2019m specially bothered by the drivers\u2019 selfishness because I\u2019m worried I live too selfishly myself? On that logic, it\u2019s no surprise I\u2019m less viscerally angered by terrorist atrocities, since I don\u2019t secretly fear I might commit one.</p> <p>It\u2019s illuminating to examine your hostile feelings toward others, and theirs about you, through this lens. Plus, it lets you read Trump like a book \u2013 not one penned by a ghostwriter, but written, however inadvertently, from the heart.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Spain\u2019s football stadiums will be full this season \u2013 and that\u2019s an order. Well, they\u2019ll look full, anyway. The Spanish league will fine clubs whose grounds aren\u2019t at 75% capacity, double for those who don\u2019t reach 50%. The part of their grounds that are visible on TV screens, that is. </p> <p>There will be someone there whose job it is to count and sanctions will apply to the stand and the corners opposite the master camera \u2013 the televisual U, it\u2019s called. The bit that can be seen. As for the bit that can\u2019t be seen, well, that bit can\u2019t be seen. </p> <p>For those clubs who are worried that they might not be able to fill their stadiums, fear not: the league will help. By subsidising tickets? By laying on travel? By scheduling games at fan-friendly times? Don\u2019t be daft. This weekend Deportivo Alav\u00e9s return to the first division: they play at 10.30pm on a Sunday night, three and a half hours away. No, the league will help by providing tarpaulin to cover empty stands behind the cameras. So that\u2019s alright, then. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/21/barcelona-andre-gomes-valencia-transfer-reach-agreement\">Barcelona reach agreement with Valencia to sign Portugal\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Gomes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you can\u2019t fill it, fake it. Perhaps they shouldn\u2019t have to, but last season 43.7% of seats sat empty across the first and second divisions \u2013 the latter now comically known as the Liga 1, 2, 3. Of the first division teams, according to La Liga figures collated by Roberto Bay\u00f3n, only Real Madrid and Eibar occupied over 80% and only eight would be above the 75% threshold \u2013 if it applied to the whole stadium. </p> <p>Spain is a big country with a smaller population than the UK; two teams account for 60% of fans; there is less of a culture of away travel; some smaller clubs with fewer fans have overachieved and some bigger clubs with big fan bases have underachieved (the league won\u2019t admit it, but they were delighted that Sporting survived and Getafe didn\u2019t); some clubs have unrealistically large stadiums; and despite claims to the contrary kick of times, dates and prices don\u2019t help. </p> <p>There are many reasons for Spain\u2019s inabilty to fill stadiums but the football is not really one of them. And nor, it should be added, is the situation always as bad as it is sometimes assumed to be: among first division clubs only Getafe and Espanyol, two special cases, were below 40% last season, while a trip to the Pizju\u00e1n, Heli\u00f3polis, the Molin\u00f3n, M\u00e1laga or Bilbao can be a superb experience. If the structural problems are a realty, things are improving, and they have not left the football itself in tatters: it is the football that saves Spanish football. </p> <p>The last three Champions League winners and the last three Europa League winners are all Spanish. This is genuinely a three-team league now, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s rebellion providing a huge service. And although there was a recognition that Leicester couldn\u2019t happen here \u2013 in terms of resources at least, Atl\u00e9tico winning the title wasn\u2019t as far off as it looks \u2013 the top three did lose 15 games between them last season. </p> <p>Those things that \u2018only happen\u2019 elsewhere happen in Spain, too. There were 11 3-2s last season, countless last-minute goals, comebacks and turnarounds. Competition. Real Madrid\u2019s title challenge needed them to come from 2-0 down to defeat Rayo 3-2 in the rain. Rayo were relegated. Levante finished bottom last season. Already down, they were the team that ended Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s title on the penultimate week of the season. \u201cThat is what makes football great,\u201d Diego Simeone said. That and much else besides. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/17/sevilla-monchi-liverpool-europa-league-final\">The secret behind Sevilla\u2019s success? Meet Monchi, the transfer wizard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This season promises, too. The attendance measures underline the obsession with the Premier League; the desire to build a TV product that looks good, even if the reality is rather different behind the lens. They reveal the importance of television \u2013 last year, 81.69% of Getafe\u2019s income came from TV, while Atl\u00e9tico were the club that least depended on it, at 25.89% \u2013 and how far behind Spain is. La Liga can\u2019t compete with the Premier League\u2019s \u00a38.5bn international deal and economics are at least one of the reasons why Paul Pogba went to Old Trafford not the Bernab\u00e9u. </p> <p>Even here, interest in English football has never been higher. There\u2019s a slightly facile, but not entirely misplaced sense that English football does it better. The rights for the Spanish league changed hands this summer, yet again; having the Premier League is a significant, if insufficient consolation for Movistar Plus, the channel that lost them. <br></p> <p>Players continue to leave. But the contradiction here, as Sevilla\u2019s sporting director, Monchi, admits, is that the Premier League has provided an (inflated) market that has been vital for Spanish clubs - more than 30 Spaniards now play in England. And then there\u2019s the fact that an export market has to produce, and Spanish clubs continue to do just that. They seek more creative ways to bridge the financial gap, and keep bringing footballers through. Put bluntly, development and coaching is better. The threat to Spain is real, though. And then there\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, and Pep Guardiola. Spain has nothing to match them. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93d1afebaf85ed6eff7765537691ac8196f6141c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93d1afebaf85ed6eff7765537691ac8196f6141c/0_1_3866_2319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alvaro Morata has rejoined Real Madrid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alvaro Morata has rejoined Real Madrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Carretero/Real Madrid via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Actually, yes it does. Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Gareth Bale, for a start. And it is a start, not the end. Spanish clubs are doing a lot right. The \u2018it\u2019 that England does better is still largely seen here as packaging not play. If they can\u2019t compete economically, in footballing terms they still can. According to Sporting Intelligence, when it comes to two-legged European ties against non-Spanish clubs, Spain is winning 45-4. And there\u2019s something special about one of those being Athletic Bilbao; there is no one like them, anywhere in Europe. </p> <p>Structurally, things are improving. Financial control has reduced debts, the league actually kicks off on time this season, no strikes, no lockouts, and a collective TV deal, enshrined in law is the first step towards deals increasing and the gap in earnings between top and bottom clubs reducing. It has to in a league where the top two were taking over \u20ac160m and the team in third wasn\u2019t reaching \u20ac50m.</p> <p>Spain keeps on going, though. \u201cHay Liga\u201d, the headlines run when the title race <br>opens up. There is a league and plenty to be excited about as a new season begins. </p> <p>There have been signings - \u00c1lvaro Morata and Andr\u00e9 Gomes the most notable \u2013 but not many stars. Not yet, anyway. But Marco Asensio might yet be, or perhaps Arda Turan will be back. The early signs are good for both. Anyway, if this has been a summer bereft of cracks at Real and Barcelona that is at least in part because there is an essential reality here: how to do you improve on Messi, Neymar and Su\u00e1rez, Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo? Presidents love a presentation, something new, but familiarity can hardly breed contempt if the players you are familiar with are the best in the world.</p> <p>This year\u2019s Ball\u00f3n d\u2019Or winner will be a La Liga player, just as he has been for the last seven years. The Golden boot winner has been a La Liga player for the last eight. The World Cup\u2019s top scorer, James Rodr\u00edguez, is in Spain (for now: he could yet be on his way out of the Real) and so is the top scorer from Euro 2016, Antoine Griezmann. Player of the tournament, too. </p> <p>Keeping Griezmann would have been a success for Atl\u00e9tico, giving him a new deal that takes his buy-out clause to \u20ac100m is even more so. And he\u2019s so good that might prove not so much a deterrent so much as a price tag. More importantly, despite saying that he had \u201cto think\u201d after the Champions league final, Simeone now claims he was never going to go. He could have told the fans pleading with him to stay, but at least he levered more investment from the club. </p> <p>Adding K\u00e9vin Gameiro strengthens them, giving them a forward line that will be almost absurdly quick, and those two things \u2013 Simeone\u2019s silence, a striker\u2019s arrival \u2013 are not unrelated. Atl\u00e9tico have Gait\u00e1n now too; they\u2019ve spent \u20ac81m to compete. </p> <p>Gameiro left Sevilla; their top scorer, gone. Grzegorz Krychowiak left too. And Ever Banega. And their captain, Coke. Their manager went to Paris Saint-Germain. Their sporting director was about to go, too. Instead he was forced to stay and rebuild yet another team. Because he has done so before, there\u2019s a certain optimism: there may be no other club where their three most important players leave and supporters still think things are going to be OK. <br></p> <p>Few rebuilding jobs have been as complete as this though; this time Sevilla look totally different under C\u00e9sar Sampaoli, the man who wants to face Real and Barcelona as equals, pressing high, competing for the ball, chasing all over the pitch and losing to both over the last week; two Super Cups, two defeats. It may yet work, it may not; it\u2019s going to be fun finding out. It will be fun hearing him and his assistant Juanma Lillo explain it all, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s going to be fun, full stop. Fascinating too. Despite the flaws, it always is. Because of them, in fact, with its presidents, players and fans. With all that stuff. And with its football too, of course. The season hasn\u2019t even started and there\u2019s been a sacking. It\u2019s happening already. <br></p> <p>Days before their season started in Europe, Villarreal fired Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, the man who brought them up from the second division, qualified for Europe, reached a semi-final and took them back to the Champions league. Meanwhile, down the coast, Valencia started the summer signing Nani but look like finishing it selling the rest: there are days to go and some way to go before they comply with Financial Fair Play criteria. There may be trouble ahead. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/17/nani-manchester-united-best-worst-moment-life\">Nani: \u2018United contract could have been best moment of my life \u2013 but it turned into the worst\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Granada are under new ownership, and new management too, and a club where entertainment and goals are guaranteed: Paco Jemez\u2019s Rayo were relegated, but he\u2019s back, with his suits and his rants and his wide, wide open football.

Oh, and they have Kevin-Prince Boateng now. </p> <p>Sporting Gij\u00f3n have signed eight players, a year later, a little less revolutionary but a little more reliable. There\u2019s something about Espanyol, where the excitement comes as a pleasant surprise and where there\u2019s also new ownership and new management: Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores is in the house, and so are Leo Baptistao, Pablo Piatti, Roberto and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes.

  "<p>The Department of Justice announced Thursday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/us-government-private-prisons-use-justice-department\">it would begin \u201cphasing out\u201d the use of private prisons for federal prisoners</a> citing superior safety and rehabilitation outcomes at state-run facilities. Deputy attorney general Sally Yates wrote that private prisons \u201csimply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources\u201d, \u201cdo not save substantially on costs\u201d, and \u201cdo not maintain the same level of safety and security\u201d as the department\u2019s own sites.</p> <p> The move has been widely hailed by advocates as one that could signal positive change for about 22,000 federal inmates across 13 facilities, but many have also paused to note that the Justice Department decision only affects about a quarter of inmates and detainees held in US private facilities.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the Justice Department\u2019s announcement is a step in the right direction, much more action is needed to scrub private prisons from our criminal justice system,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, <a href=\"http://www.colorofchange.org/about\">executive director of Color of Change</a>, an online racial justice organization.</p> <p>The decision, for example, does not apply to people held in Department of Homeland Security detention centers for immigration violations, which tally at about 34,000 on any given day, and about 400,000 over the course of a year. About 60% of those detainees are held in private facilities. By comparison, private prisons currently hold about 15% of federal prisoners and 6% of those in state corrections. </p> <p>\u201cRefugees, children, parents and everyday people seeking a better life are routinely locked up, abused and even killed by corporate-run immigrant detention facilities and despite the evidence, the Department of Homeland Security refuses to shut them down,\u201d said Greisa Martinez, advocacy director for United We Dream Action, an immigrant rights activist organization. She added that today\u2019s decision is \u201cyet more evidence of why Hillary Clinton must commit to use executive authority to provide relief to immigrants in her first 100 days, should she become president\u201d.</p> <p>Similar to other direct efforts the Obama administration has taken on prison and criminal justice reform issues recently, there is a limited impact because of how few of the nation\u2019s incarcerated people are under federal control at any given time. Federal prisoners make up just 14% of nearly 1.5 million prison inmates nationwide, while the vast majority are instead held in state correctional facilities. An additional 740,000 inmates are also detained in local jails at any given time.</p> <p>A similar dynamic was at work earlier this summer when the Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/26/obama-bans-solitary-confinement-of-juveniles-in-federal-prisons\">banned the use of solitary confinement</a> in federal juvenile facilities. It was quickly noted that only 13 juvenile inmates had endured the practice the previous year. In that same action, the president also expanded treatment for the mentally ill and increased the amount of time adult inmates in solitary must be allowed to spend outside of their cells in federal facilities. Obama said at the time he hoped the changes would \u201cserve as a model for state and local corrections systems\u201d.</p> <p>In Texas, where more people are incarcerated than any other state, the state\u2019s ACLU called on local leaders to \u201cfollow the lead of the Justice Department and end their relationships with the for-profit prison industry\u201d in the wake of the announcement.</p> <p>Texas officials \u201ccould start by phasing out one or more private state jail contracts when they expire next year\u201d, said Rebecca L Robertson, legal and policy director for the ACLU of Texas. \u201cThe for-profit prison model creates perverse incentives to cut corners and lock up as many people as possible, all on the taxpayers\u2019 dime. The results have been predictable: over-criminalization, overcrowding, inhumane treatment, inadequate services and healthcare and routine abuse of detainees.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement follows a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/private-federal-prisons-more-dangerous-justice-department\">scathing report released last week that found privately operated federal prisons drastically more unsafe and punitive</a> than other prisons in the system. The report found that inmate-on-inmate assaults were 28% higher in private federal prisons as compared to state ones, and that cost-saving intended cutbacks to medical care in these facilities was likely at fault for the deaths of inmates experiencing medical emergencies.<br></p> <p>Jonathan Burns, the director of public affairs for Corrections Corporation of America, the largest private prison company in the country downplayed any concern with the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that today\u2019s announcement relates only to [federal] BOP [Bureau of Prisons] correctional facilities, which make up 7% of our business,\u201d Burns said. </p> <p>The company\u2019s stock dipped to it\u2019s lowest point since 2010 after the news was announced, plunging by nearly 50% in about an hour, before rebounding slightly. </p> <p>Burns said the company continued to \u201cvalue our partners, and we will continue to work with them\u201d.</p>",

So far those fears may be unfounded. According to the <a href=\"http://new.dhh.louisiana.gov/ \">Louisiana department of health</a>, four new cases of Zika were reported this week, but all were contracted during travel to affected areas.</p> <p>\u201cOur surveillance activities include working with hospitals and other healthcare providers who notify us if and when a possible Zika case is diagnosed,\u201d said Frank Welch, who heads the state\u2019s Zika response team. \u201cWe also work with mosquito control agencies throughout the state who conduct mosquito testing in areas of known human cases to determine if mosquitos in those areas are carrying the virus.\u201d</p> <p>The bigger threat comes from the West Nile virus, which struck the area a decade ago after Hurricane Katrina. Doctors are warning residents to watch out for symptoms: fever, headache, stiffness of the neck, shakiness. </p> <p>Meanwhile state officials gathered at the capitol on Thursday to sort out how to pay for the emergency response, which costs the state millions of dollars per day, and will likely run into the hundreds of millions. The state was strapped for cash and considering a short-term loan before the storm, and lawmakers met to discuss moving ahead with it as soon as possible. Some of the costs will be absorbed by help from the federal government, which has declared 20 of the state\u2019s 64 parishes to be major disaster sites. More than 60,000 people have registered for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).</p> <p>According to local officials, who have pressed for years to build a diversionary canal near Baton Rouge, much of the calamity and cost could have been avoided. The canal project was blueprinted but has been delayed since the 1980s. Its proponents say it would have prevented at least a quarter of the flooding if the US Army Corps of Engineers had acted sooner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/louisiana-flooding-natural-disaster-weather-climate-change\">Disasters like Louisiana floods will worsen as planet warms, scientists warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe see it over and over again in government,\u201d said US representative Garret Graves, who represents southern Louisiana. \u201cWe end up spending billions of dollars after, instead of millions before.\u201d</p> <p>The proposed canal would shunt floodwater from the Amite and Comite rivers to the much larger Mississippi river.

  "<p>I was 30 and a mature student in art college when I first realised I saw the alphabet in glorious technicolour. I was building a 3D calendar (three wooden cubes telling the day, date and month) when my tutor asked why I had painted the six blue. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what six is,\u201d I told her. </p> <p>I think of my grapheme-colour synesthesia as a curiosity, rather than a condition. I see every letter and number in its own unique hue and, when they are combined into words, every word makes a colour that is equally unique to my mind. Experts say it is a blending of the senses; to do with the way signals in the brain are processed.</p> <p>But it is impossible to recognise that you have it until you realise others don\u2019t; it was not until that odd moment in the art studio that I started to question whether a rainbow alphabet was the norm.</p> <p>After the conversation with my tutor, I started to talk to people about it, but they didn\u2019t understand and I soon stopped because they clearly thought it was nonsense. Synesthesia of one sense or another is estimated to affect up to 0.5% of the population and can present itself through taste or hearing music, too.</p> <p>I can tell someone the colour of their name instantly. Processing words is like mixing paints on a palette: C is white, D is beige, E is yellow and so on. They have never changed or reconfigured.</p> <p>It was my youngest daughter, Jenny, who was most intrigued by it. She found it magical as a child. As an adult, I remember buying her narcissus flowers because they were the same yellow as her name.</p> <p>My other daughter, Katie, is a metallic blue-black and my son Mike\u2019s shade is just a bit lighter \u2013 they both have a K, an I and an E. My husband, Bob, is brick red.</p> <p>When Jenny told me the names of my granddaughters, each time it was their colours I saw first: Lila is white; Ava, her little sister, is green.</p> <p>I also have a degree of spatial synesthesia, which means that days of the week, months, years, follow a pattern in my head; a sort-of curve. If you ask me what 10 years looks like, I will immediately zoom out from a week, like a camera lens.</p> <p>The associations are involuntary but, in many ways, they are rather like having particularly pleasant muzak on in the background \u2013 the colours are always there. As a furniture designer, it did not have a tremendous bearing on my trade. But in daily life, words sing out to me everywhere I go. Advertising hoardings, road signs and posters are all brighter and louder to me. If I zoomed in and allowed myself to see every single colour, it would be overwhelming.</p> <p>I read the papers every day and about four novels a month, so it certainly hasn\u2019t distracted from my enjoyment of the written word. If anything, it enhances it. The Guardian, incidentally, is a mixture of pinky-beige and green.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/10/experience-90-degree-bend-penis\">Experience: I had a 90-degree bend in my penis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Synesthesia is not a definite science. I remember reading someone else\u2019s story in a book, thinking their colours were different from mine. Each synesthete experiences their own personal colour spectrum.</p> <p>Even now, at 65, it sometimes surprises me. My friend and I are writing a book and we\u2019ve had to Google a lot of things: new words mean new colours.</p> <p>I can\u2019t imagine what it must feel like not to have it, except that it must be rather boring. In some ways I wish I\u2019d known earlier, but I was brought up in the 1950s when parents were inside the house and children played at the bottom of the garden, so no one sat down with me and asked why I\u2019d chosen the colours I had when I did a painting.</p> <p>I have heard that it is possible to train people to see the world in this way \u2013 and that it might help with dementia. But it hasn\u2019t affected my memory. In fact, Bob will ask me someone\u2019s name and I will say to him, \u201cI can\u2019t remember, but I know it\u2019s green.\u201d</p> <p>There is nothing dull or grey in my spectrum.

  "<p>The <em>Sex &amp; Death</em> anthology began \u2013 as projects of odd passion frequently do \u2013 from a pub chat. The pub in question is long forgotten \u2013 The Undertaker\u2019s Arms, or The Brewer\u2019s Droop, let\u2019s say. My co-editor, Peter Hobbs, and I were talking about why the short story form is so difficult to master, why, when it\u2019s done properly, it has such vitality and power, and what the best short stories are really about.</p> <p>I\u2019d recently read an interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/22/james-salter\" title=\"\">James Salter</a> in which he mentioned that sex and death, as primary themes, were reasons the New Yorker had rejected his, and his fellow writers\u2019, stories. But aren\u2019t they essential human topics, I asked Pete, aren\u2019t they critical to short fiction? They\u2019re also the trickiest to get right, Pete noted, and then rolled out a pithy Alice Munro quote. When asked why so much of her work was about these two subjects, she replied, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be? It\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p> <p>Life can indeed be reduced to these two standards, especially around closing time. And, once you\u2019ve invoked the Nobel-winning Munro, author of collections such as <em>Runaway</em> and <em>The&#xa0;Love of a Good Woman</em>, short story projects suddenly seem like serious business. After sobering, and cajoling a&#xa0;handful of writers we knew could handle such strong meat to \u201cagree in principle\u201d to contribute, off we went with our pitch to the publishers.</p> <p>There\u2019s much woofing about the poor state of the short story in the UK, its economic viability and readers\u2019 preferences for long form, but this wasn\u2019t too hard a sell. Sex and death are the most fascinating and vexing aspects of our lives, fiction\u2019s greatest challenge to get right. And the short story is a literary device peculiarly suited, or perhaps perfectly adapted, to host what often seems to matter most \u2013 our comings and goings, what Faulkner called the front and back doors of the world.</p> <p>But how can this be? It\u2019s a diminutive vessel compared with the magnitude of such existential contents, such forces. How can a small thing be capable of immense holding?</p> <p>Short stories are strange, almost impossible language systems. They are acts of compression, without seeming to compress. They concentrate, without clotting. They provide a focused view of an expanse, and, in the best examples, the weight of the exterior world, a universe even, can be seen or sensed outside the narrative frame.</p> <p>On one level, short stories are handy for creating disquiet and excruciation in the reader, so subjects that unsettle us and render us vulnerable \u2013 our mortality, our sexual intrigues \u2013 are well showcased. The form is very good at unzipping the mind\u2019s fly, so to speak. Brevity is the key: not having to keep up the suspense and the strategy for too long; getting under the skin and leaving an indelible, if sometimes enigmatic, impression on the reader. A window in, rather than the full picture, can often provide the most poignant, inviting and repelling vision. As readers, we do the work of intuiting and interpreting. In doing so, we are analysed.</p> <p>To delve a little deeper into the psychology, short stories seem especially suited to cognitive dissonance, and management of conflicting attitudes and behaviours. How characters act, and what they say, is often not how they should act or what they should say. Normality and abnormality, rightness and wrongness, often run in tandem. This is not easy for us to metabolise, but short stories aren\u2019t about consolation, explanation or solvency, they don\u2019t tell us all will be well; that\u2019s not their job. To use a classic cognitive dissonance metaphor, they invite us to&#xa0;smoke and also to know that we shouldn\u2019t smoke, because it\u2019s lethal.</p> <p>Stories such as <a href=\"http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/goodman.html\" title=\"\">\u201cA Good Man Is Hard To Find\u201d</a> by Flannery O\u2019Connor and \u201cThe Babysitter\u201d by Robert Coover are powered by the counterintuitive; both are toe-curling in their unfolding of an everyday uncanny. In the former, the threat of death remakes the meaning and intensity of life; in the latter, it\u2019s impossible to distinguish between what is sexual fantasy and what is real; both propositions are presented identically.</p> <p>Short stories like these seek sophisticated, adult responses from readers, an assessment of philosophical and social complexity, personality duality, and imperfection, rather than juvenile mental \u201csplitting\u201d (she\u2019s all good, he\u2019s all bad). They perform little narrative experiments on our morality, our sense of propriety and safety; they ask us to consider our realistic whole.</p> <p>This is not something we\u2019ve mastered. Humans, as advancing, medicalised, prophylactic-donning beings, have become experts at neutralising our temporal states and our urgeful natures, through medication, television and soft pornography. Our conscious animal natures mean we exist somewhere in between what we imagine and what we bodily are. The base unalterables and outcomes \u2013 of the march of cancer through the bones, of the rip in the condom \u2013 thrill, horrify and disrupt our civilised symmetry more than anything else, fundamentally irreconcilable as they are. Throughout its history, one particular literary form circles around these themes, and nails them.</p> <p>The best short stories are masterful, not just by virtue of their testing, exclusive format \u2013 fewer words and greater significance \u2013 but because they deliver vital existential prescriptions. They un-simplify. They let us know we aren\u2019t fully in control, even if we pay the mortgage on time, try not to look at the postman\u2019s apple-ish buttocks, and take our multivitamins. They don\u2019t problematise life\u2019s choreography to make reading sustainably interesting, as novels often do, but remind us that life is inherently problematic. Not because we\u2019re hypochondriacs or idiots, but because our bodies and our minds still vie; we\u2019ve not reconciled that particular war, and perhaps we never will.</p> <p>The greatest short stories are a tonic for our complacency, our narcissism and our denial, a succinct way to tell the truth about our selves, if truth can ever be told. They don\u2019t simply deal in epiphany, twists or contradiction, and judging the form on such basic apparatus misses the point. Short stories are bafflingly stable literary worlds through which to consider the instability and mutability of creating and ending, of sex and death, of it all.

  "<p>Ahead of the release of his debut album<a href=\"https://www.torylanezitoldyou.com/\"> I Told You</a>, which came out on Friday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/torylanez?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Tory Lanez</a> is contemplating the event that inspired him to make music in the first place. It wasn\u2019t seeing an artist on stage, or a particular record, but something more fundamental. \u201cMy mom died when I was 11 years old,\u201d explains the R&amp;B star, in the midst of promoting his album in Chicago. Lanez and his mother were close; she died from complications from anaemia. \u201cAt the time I was being very bad because I didn\u2019t know how to express myself. Music gave me an outlet to express myself and channel that anger.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, Lanez has gone from being a kid searching for answers to a struggling artist looking for a break. These days however, he\u2019s enjoying his stature as one of 2016\u2019s most talked-about artists. \u201cHonestly man, it hasn\u2019t hit me yet because I\u2019ve been working so much,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a lot of money, but I still feel broke. When I say I feel broke, I don\u2019t mean broke in a financial sense but I still feel like that kid from the gutter who\u2019s still trying to get it, even though I\u2019m at the place I want to be.\u201d </p> <p>Lanez was born in Toronto. His real name is Daystar Peterson \u2013 he adopted Tory as a nod to the Notorious BIG. Lanez had turbulent childhood. His father was a missionary who moved from city to city spreading the word: Lanez lived in Atlanta, New York and Miami before heading back to Toronto as a teenager to live with his grandmother. (She eventually kicked him out of the house and he wound up on his own for a time.) </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9rFeGAdX0A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P9rFeGAdX0A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He picked up musical influences from each location. \u201cI\u2019m a very cultural person and Canada is a very cultural place,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn Canada, you grow up listening to so much different music that when it\u2019s time to make your own, you subconsciously take what you\u2019ve heard growing up and it goes into your own sound. I think that\u2019s what makes music coming from Canadian artists stand out.\u201d He describes his own music as \u201cswavey\u201d, meaning that it fuses genres. His current single Luv mixes ragga with R&amp;B and cold, ethereal synthesisers; last year\u2019s smash Say It updated Brownstone\u2019s classic new jack swing record If You Love Me into a 21st century sex jam. </p> <p>Back in 2009, Lanez crafted his first mixtape. Called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvzj2wC7mkU\">TL 2 TO</a>, while raw and unpolished it already exhibited some of his energy and charisma. In order to promote it, Lanez uploaded a series of music videos to YouTube which soon caught the interest a famous countryman. \u201cJustin Bieber found me on YouTube and was really trying to sign me,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, what the fuck? Why me? How, of all people, did he find me?\u201d As Bieber was just 16 at the time the idea fell through, but fellow chart-topper <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrTz5xjmso4\">Sean Kingston</a>, who was touring with Bieber at the time, was able to swoop in and snapped him up instead. \u201cI was just putting my work in,\u201d says Lanez, who was just 17 at the time. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure how they came across me \u2013 maybe it was the Canadian connection.\u201d</p> <p>Lanez is now 24. He has been gearing up for the release of his debut studio album ever since Bieber took notice by releasing a series of mixtapes and collaborating with a range of hot songwriters and producers. One those names is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnHofSA0CKE\">Benny Blanco</a>, the pop producer who has concocted smashes for everyone from Maroon 5 to Katy Perry and is known for helping fledgling artists become household names. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest producers I could ever work with,\u201d says Lanez of the hitmaker who Lanez is now signed with through Mad Love, Blanco\u2019s imprint with Interscope Records. \u201cHe\u2019s a young legend and I wouldn\u2019t be here without him.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUq1rZ7mmns\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xUq1rZ7mmns?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Blanco helped Lanez craft his current hit Luv, a Jamaican-flavored R&amp;B jam that is helping Lanez bridge the gap from mixtape credibility to mainstream success. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go on the record and start singing in an American way or Canadian kind of way,\u201d Lanez says of the rising track, which coincidentally sounds reminiscent of a track that Sean Kingston would put out. \u201cI was raised around so many Jamaicans, so I wanted to go at Luv with an accent and give it a Caribbean vibe.\u201d The result is a new flavour of patois, a Canadian take on the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2013/aug/30/mind-your-language-jafaican\">Jafaican</a>\u201d accent London kids (for example) have adopted, showcased on British grime records by the likes of Skepta.</p> <p>Despite his budding success, there\u2019s been hiccups along the way. A feud with fellow Toronto star Drake has dogged him since 2010, with the two stars trading veiled disses on a variety of each other\u2019s tracks: on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg4G2lm5ePA\">Summer Sixteen</a>, Drake raps: \u201cAll you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little\u201d; on his remix of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPQI6IZyNo0\">MadeinTYO\u2019s Uber Everywhere</a>, Lanez responds: \u201cYou some actor nigga boy, I used to see you on the screen.\u201d Perhaps wary of getting stuck in Drake\u2019s shadow, Lanez declines to discuss the rapper today. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPQI6IZyNo0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yPQI6IZyNo0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A more serious controversy came in March, when a concert in Texas made headlines after multiple people were arrested and <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/03/28/tory-lanez-concert-riot/\">Lanez was accused of inciting a riot</a>. Lanez says that he\u2019s striving to improving his stage presence, which often finds him climbing around or crowdsurfing. \u201cEvery time I do something in life I try to outdo myself. It\u2019s all about taking things day by day and my crowd control has gotten better,\u201d he says. \u201dI can\u2019t really talk about [the Texas] situation. I didn\u2019t do anything. It was more of a situation where the person who ran the event did some things they weren\u2019t supposed to do and it just caused problems.\u201d </p> <p>Now, his focus is on I Told You, set to be one of the defining albums of the late summer. \u201cI\u2019m thankful to God that my life changed, but I\u2019m also still on my grind,\u201d he says of the constant slog of building a career as an artist. Will he ever go back to his real \u2013 and perhaps even more extraordinary \u2013 name? \u201cI believe later in life I\u2019m gonna change my name when I start making the right music,\u201d he explains. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m making the right music to have that name yet. When I get to a certain level, I\u2019ll start going by Daystar.\u201d </p>",

  "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Six years ago the country took a collective deep breath when it realised one of the fallouts of coalition government was that Nick Clegg was being left in charge of the country while David Cameron went on holiday. Up till then the whole point of the Lib Dem leader in the national psyche was that he shouldn\u2019t be left in charge of anything. Fast forward to this week and what we wouldn\u2019t give for Nick, as we now have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/boris-johnson-senior-uk-minister-theresa-may-holiday\">Boris Johnson in charge</a>. </p> <p>Theresa May clearly understood how terrifying those of us left behind in Blighty would find the prospect as she made sure no one found out the news until she was safely out the country herself, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/theresa-may-seeks-peace-and-quiet-on-alpine-walking-holiday\">on holiday in Switzerland</a>. If it\u2019s possible to worsen international relations and start a third world war in two weeks then you can rely on Boris to find a way.

Predictably, given the row about Trotskyist entryists to the Labour party, the 1988 EDM in which Corbyn called on the Soviet government to give complete rehabilitation to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1940/aug/22/russia.fromthearchive\">Leon Trotsky</a> was the one that made the headlines. </p> <p>But the one tabled in 2004, and signed by both him and John McDonnell, which declared \u201cThis house is appalled at the revelations in MI5 files regarding the inhumane proposals to use pigeons as flying bombs; recognises the important and life-saving role of carrier pigeons in two world wars and wonders at the lack of gratitude towards these gentle creatures; and believes that humans represent the most obscene, perverted, uncivilised and lethal species ever to inhabit the planet and looks forward to the day when the inevitable asteroid slams into the <br>Earth and wipes them out thus <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2003-04/1255\">giving nature the opportunity to start again</a>\u201d remains my favourite.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Trying to keep up with what Brexit means other than Brexit is becoming ever more confusing. Once we were going to be triggering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jun/29/what-is-article-50-brexit-video-explainer\">article 50</a> the day after the country voted to leave the EU but now it keeps getting kicked further and further into the long grass. Some time in 2019 is now being suggested as the earliest date possible \u2013 a date so close to the next general election it almost certainly won\u2019t happen until afterwards, at which point the next government will feel it has a mandate to push it back even further. </p> <p>Not even those who are meant to know what is going on seem to know what is going on. Last week Liam Fox issued a press release on the Department for International Trade\u2019s website that in effect admitted that were Britain to leave the European single market it would trade with the rest of the EU under World Trade Organisation rules. This week that particular press release has been taken down from the department\u2019s website. It seems that someone has finally got round to telling the Fantastic Mr Fox that telling everyone they will have to pay 10% more on imported cars and 12% more on clothes when he had previously assured the country the EU would be falling over backwards to conduct free trade deals with the UK was not being exactly on message.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>The Olympic medal haul keeps growing and growing.

Nor do I care if the country\u2019s success has been bought with lottery funding. Given the amount of money the government manages to waste on not being able to make up its mind on Hinkley Point C, HS2, London\u2019s third runway and Brexit, a few million quid to Britain\u2019s cyclists to cheer us all up once every four years seems like money very well spent. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"779fcc0402baaf82249e619b540ac978a0291974\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/779fcc0402baaf82249e619b540ac978a0291974/0_164_4408_2645/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Team GB Olympic cyclists Joanna Rowsell, Ed Clancy, Jason Kenny, Steven Burke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Team GB Olympic cyclists Joanna Rowsell, Ed Clancy, Jason Kenny and Steven Burke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MCPIX/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I do detect a certain complacency setting in.

Why settle for 20 or so golds when there are so many more we could be winning? Britain\u2019s record in the shooting and fencing has been fairly dismal. Surely it wouldn\u2019t take that much lottery money to train people to shoot straight or take someone out with a sword? An SAS sniper should be nailed on for a gold with a little more help.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>MI5 has a new secret weapon.

This would be much less likely to happen if there weren\u2019t gaps in UK law which allowed companies to take advantage of weaker regulation abroad, even to the point of committing human rights abuses. This has left a trail of disaster around the world and devastated local communities.</p> <p>The reluctance of UK authorities to take action stands out in these cases. <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/07/UK-giving-green-light-for-corporate-crime/\" title=\"\">Pressed by Amnesty International</a> to investigate Trafigura\u2019s role in the dumping of toxic waste in Abidjan, UK regulatory bodies have played a game of pass-the-parcel until making the astonishing admission that they lack the strong laws, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/23/uk-authorities-lack-resources-to-investigate-trafigura-over-toxic-waste\" title=\"\">resources</a> and expertise to take on a corporate giant.</p> <p>What is required now are corporate rules that are fit for the age of powerful multinationals which operate across borders. A good start would be to introduce a new version of <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org.uk/our-work/business-integrity/bribery-act/\" title=\"\">Section 7 of the UK Bribery Act</a> to be made applicable in human rights cases. This would create an offence of failing to prevent serious human rights abuses within a company\u2019s global operations.</p> <p>Such a law would make the company accountable for abuses unless it could show it had adequate procedures in place to prevent them \u2013 a strong incentive for companies to proactively ensure they respect human rights. This \u201cdue diligence\u201d principle has become standard practice for bribery.</p> <p>Even where the behaviour of Lonmin, Trafigura, Shell and others does not constitute a crime, nurturing a compliance culture for human rights would make it harder for abuses to drag on unchecked for years and would give victims a realistic chance of securing justice and redress. Almost every major economy in the world now criminalises companies for foreign bribery. But few have legislated for illegal acts that lead to serious human rights abuses overseas.</p> <p>If May is serious about tackling corporate crime, she will need to put in place stronger laws and enforcement. Otherwise corporate impunity will prevail and continue to stain the reputation of UK plc in many parts of the world.</p>",

  "<p>As dedicated followers of JavaScript fashion, we \u2013 the Guardian US interactive team \u2013 had been looking for an opportunity to experiment with Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs. \u2018Progressive Web App\u2019 is essentially a marketing term (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nolanlawson/status/740214825284837376\">like AJAX or \u2018responsive design\u2019</a>) that encompasses a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/\">variety of techniques</a> for creating experiences that rival native apps in terms of slickness, features and usability \u2013 most notably around offline support.</p> <p>The Olympics gave us that opportunity in the form of <a href=\"https://riorun.theguardian.com\">RioRun</a>, an interactive podcast that tracks your distance as you run outside (or on a treadmill) and translates it into progress along the marathon route through downtown Rio de Janeiro. As you run, you learn about the area you\u2019re running through \u2013 its history, culture, politics, recent news events \u2013 while ambient audio recorded on location plays in the background.</p> <p>Creating the experience as a PWA made sense for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Because it uses geolocation, it needs to be served over HTTPS. For that reason, we opted to create a dedicated subdomain rather than serving the app from an article page on theguardian.com (which hasn\u2019t yet fully transitioned to HTTPS)</li> <li>There\u2019s a lot of audio, some of which might start downloading after you\u2019ve started running. For people in rural areas with patchy connectivity, or those with limited data plans, offline support is very useful</li> <li>No-one (at least, no-one we know) is going to complete the experience in one go, so it\u2019s far more likely that people will get through the whole route if the app can easily be saved to the home screen</li> </ul> <p>It was not, however, without challenges.</p> <h2>Service workers, and how not to make them</h2> <p>The heart of a PWA is the service worker. Service workers are JavaScript files that sit between the browser and the network, responding to network requests (for example by serving cached responses) and handling background activity such as push notifications.</p> <p>Chrome, Firefox and Opera all have good support for most service worker APIs. Edge (formerly Internet Explorer) is working on it. Safari is the conspicuous exception \u2013 iPhone and iPad users will have to wait a while before being able to take advantage of these new features.</p> <p>Registering a service worker is straightforward:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-code\"> \t\t<pre  class=\"prettyprint\"\t\t><code class=\"language-javascript\">if ( 'serviceWorker' in navigator ) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register( '/service-worker.js' )\n    .then( function ( reg ) {\n      console.log( '\u2713 service worker ready' );\n    });\n}</code\n></pre> </figure>  <p>Inside the service worker we\u2019re listening for three events \u2013 <em>install</em> (which happens whenever someone visits the page for the first time, or when a visitor returns after the service worker was updated), <em>activate</em> (which happens when no previous service worker is still active on the page), and <em>fetch</em> (which happens whenever a network request is made).<br></p> <p>This lifecycle takes some getting used to, not least because it means that reloading the page no longer behaves the way most web developers are used to. Rather than replacing an obsolete service worker, as you might naively expect, reloading the page will keep the out-of-date service worker \u2018in control\u2019 \u2013 i.e. intercepting network requests \u2013 until you close the tab (and any others with the same page) completely. Meanwhile, if you need to clear the service worker\u2019s cache, you have to remember to do a hard refresh (Cmd-Shift-R on a Mac). Until you understand what\u2019s going on it\u2019s a thoroughly maddening experience.</p> <p>For a while, not understanding what was going on, we resorted to all sorts of mad hacks \u2013 randomising the service worker URL and so on \u2013 in an effort to see our changes reflected.</p> <p>(We collected some of our notes together and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/fd6c3c73e6e707e312d7c5d7d0f3b2f9\">shared them</a>, and discovered that we\u2019re not alone \u2013 many people have had the same frustrations, despite the wealth of tutorials and documentation available. The combined surface area of the new APIs is truly daunting, and it remains to be seen if an ecosystem of service worker libraries will ease the pain.)</p> <p>Once you get there though, it\u2019s quite magical when you load the page on a phone, switch it to airplane mode, reload, and continue using the app as though nothing was wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fb274008b20e395338a9bc84b54d7e32d9e1d72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fb274008b20e395338a9bc84b54d7e32d9e1d72/0_0_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RioRun screens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RioRun screens</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian US Interactive Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Cache rules everything around me</h2> <p>We\u2019re able to do that by caching all the files needed by the app (apart from the audio files) inside the <em>install</em> handler. The cache manifest is automatically generated during our build process, so we don\u2019t need to worry about forgetting to add new icons etc as we add them to the app.</p> <p>When we deploy a new version of the app, the cache is given a unique name, allowing us to free up the space taken by the old cache.</p> <p>Audio is handled differently, because we don\u2019t want to download all 92 .mp3 files (totalling around 125Mb) when the app starts. Instead, we cache those files progressively, storing them in a separate cache that survives the deployment of a new version of the app. A \u2018preload audio files\u2019 button allows runners to fetch the next several miles of audio \u2013 we judged that it would be better than downloading the whole lot, since the browser can delete the cache at any time in order to free up space. (Since launching, Google\u2019s Alex Russell <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/762000313075113984\">pointed us towards the Quota API</a> which allows you to request additional permanent storage, but for now we prefer the partial approach as it\u2019s less to ask of people who may not yet be fully committed to the app.)</p> <p>Once an audio file is no longer needed (because we\u2019ve passed the point on the route at which playback starts) we can safely discard it from the cache.</p> <p>Don\u2019t make the mistake we made \u2013 if you need to cache additional assets after the initial <em>install</em> event, you can access the service worker cache API as <em>window.caches</em>. There\u2019s no need to send a message to the service worker and have it send progress messages back. That\u2019s good, because client-worker messaging is hellaciously confusing.</p> <h2>No place like home</h2> <p>The URL bar is arguably the most powerful text-based interface ever devised, but getting to a web app on a mobile phone is still a cumbersome process. Typically you have to open the browser app (one tap), switch to tab view (another), press the \u2018create new tab\u2019 button (a third) then tap into the search box or URL bar (four!).

  "<p>British gin is synonymous with London. However, in recent years, more than two-thirds of the UK\u2019s total gin production has moved outside the capital \u2013 and outside England altogether. Scotland is now at the heart of the British gin industry, home to two of the world\u2019s largest brands (Gordon\u2019s and Tanqueray) but also to an array of craft gin distillers: currently more than 25. In the past two years, half a dozen new craft gins have reached the shelves, from names such as Crossbill and Heather Rose. There\u2019s even a fresh venture to celebrate from the Isle of Jura, where three women have established <a href=\"http://www.lussagin.com/index.html\">Lussa Gin</a>, using 15 botanicals from the hills and lochs, woods and coastline of the island.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dadec2b56dfc8c76d993d27975f6a02583732fe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dadec2b56dfc8c76d993d27975f6a02583732fe9/0_166_3837_2302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Looking down to Ardlussa Bay on Isle of Jura, Southern Inner Hebrides, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ardlussa Bay on the Isle of Jura, where Claire Fletcher, Alicia MacInnes and Georgina Kitching have established Lussa gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To reflect this rise in Scottish craft gin, the <a href=\"http://www.wsta.co.uk/\">Wine and Spirit Trade Association</a> (WSTA) has launched the <a href=\"http://www.wsta.co.uk/images/Spirits/GinTrail/Scotland_GinMap2016.pdf\">Scotland Gin Trail</a>.

For example, on the north coast, <a href=\"http://www.dunnetbaydistillers.co.uk/dunnet-bay-distillers/\">Dunnet Bay Distillery</a> creates the delicate, aromatic Rock Rose Gin, which has earned awards for husband-and-wife team Martin and Claire Murray.

The juniper-flavoured Dutch spirit genever first arrived in Edinburgh in the 1600s, and was gleefully embraced. When a tax on imported spirits cut off the supply, entrepreneurial locals began to craft their own cheap, readily available versions, and helped usher in an era of mass drunkenness and moral hand-wringing across the UK, known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_Craze\">the Gin Craze</a>. But then in the late 18th century, Scots discovered a taste for whisky, and gin lost out.</p> <p>Until now. The release of the South Ayrshire-made <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://uk.hendricksgin.com/\">Hendrick\u2019s Gin</a> in 1999 signalled the start of a new era for gin in Scotland, and the past few years have seen further development and new ventures.

  "<p><a href=\"http://impress.press/\">Impress</a>, the press regulator established as an alternative to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (<a href=\"https://www.ipso.co.uk/\">Ipso</a>), has drafted an alternative ethical code.</p> <p>The new \u201cstandards code\u201d has been <a href=\"http://impress-press.php5.hostingweb.co.uk/downloads/file/draft-impress-standards-code.pdf\">published on the Impress website</a> and is available for public consultation (until 29 September).*</p> <p>Following a detailed definition of public interest, and the way in which it should be invoked, it runs to 10 clauses, many of which are similar in tone, if not in wording, to the 16 clauses in <a href=\"https://www.ipso.co.uk/editors-code-of-practice/\">the editors\u2019 code of practice</a> (ECP) as administered by Ipso. </p> <p>One noticeable difference is the responsibility it places on \u201cpublishers\u201d - as distinct from journalists or \u201cthe press\u201d - to obey the rules. </p> <p>Example: it states that \u201cwhilst free to be partisan, <em>publishers</em> must not misrepresent or distort the facts\u201d while the ECP states: \u201c<em>The Press</em>, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\u201d [my italics]</p> <p>It is much shorter than the editors\u2019 code, but it draws heavily on the ECP, likewise beginning with a key clause stressing the need for accuracy. Several other similar clauses follow - on children, discrimination, harassment, privacy, suicide and sources - that feature also in the editors\u2019 code. </p> <p>Although there are no specific clauses about intrusions into grief and hospitals, these appear to be covered in shorter form in the clause on privacy. </p> <p>Similarly, a short clause headlined \u201cjustice\u201d deals with injunctions about payments to criminal and witnesses in trials, but in nothing like the detail employed in the ECP.</p> <p>There is no clause dealing with financial journalism. This might be the subject of a revision during the consultation period, although it could be argued that the \u201ctransparency\u201d clause, which is aimed at precluding conflicts of interest, covers it.</p> <p>One clause, \u201cattribution\u201d, states that \u201cpublishers must take all reasonable steps to identify and credit the originator of any third party content\u201d. There is no such clause in the ECP.</p> <p>Oddly, given the reason for the Leveson inquiry (phone hacking), Impress\u2019s draft code does not specifically prohibit the use of subterfuge, hidden cameras or clandestine listening devices, all of which are subject to strict regulation under the editors\u2019 code. However, as a reader has pointed out, they probably would be covered by the prohibition - except in the public interest - on the use of \u201ccovert means.\u201d</p> <p>In the preamble to its draft code, Impress states it is meant to be \u201ca practical working tool which enables journalists, editors and publishers to do their jobs\u201d while being \u201ceasily understood by the public, and enforceable through regulation.\u201d<br></p> <p>This phrase, \u201cenforceable through regulation\u201d, is likely to raise the eyebrows of publishers (and journalists) who opposed the recommendations of the Leveson report on the grounds that they amounted to a threat to press freedom through state regulation.</p> <p><strong>Initial comment: </strong>During the Leveson hearings, despite the ordure heaped on the Press Complaints Commission, the ethical code it administered was one of the least contentious issues.</p> <p>The editors\u2019 code of practice, originally created in 1990 by a group of editors (including me) was part of the PCC package. Down the years, it was amended to take account of events we did not foresee (the treatment of Princess Diana, an editor\u2019s purchase of shares, advances in surveillance technology).</p> <p>Essentially, the spine remained the same and, having served the trade so well, it was hardly a surprise that it was adopted, without change, by Ipso.</p> <p>That spine is also evident in the Impress alternative. So, apart from tinkering at the edges - and the very definite stress on publishers being accountable for the output of their various outlets - it does not strike me as either unique or even necessary. It is largely window-dressing, with several phrases plucked from the ECP.</p> <p>Yet it is not as comprehensive as the editors\u2019 code, which was amended and enlarged in order to deal with loopholes that the Impress code appears to leave open. <br></p> <p>Some clauses are weaker and flabby. Take the one on children. It says \u201cpublishers must only interview, photograph or otherwise record the words or actions of a child under the age of 16 years with the assent of the child or a responsible adult\u201d. <em>Assent of a child?</em></p> <p>I suspect the transparency clause was supposed to overcome the problem highlighted by Peter Oborne when <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/peter-oborne/why-i-have-resigned-from-telegraph\">he resigned from the Daily Telegraph</a> in February 2015 over the supposed link between editorial decision-making and trying to keep advertisers happy. If so, it\u2019s a terrible failure, being unenforceable and open to wide interpretation by publishers.</p> <p>The justice clause is also flawed. Note that final injunction: \u201cPublishers must not pay public officials for information, except as permitted by law.\u201d</p> <p>But \u201cthe law\u201d, as the cases heard so recently against The Sun\u2019s staff illustrated, is far from clear. Oddly, the clause does not even offer a public interest defence for payment. Yet public interest, which Impress makes clear is at the heart of its code, was the reason juries cleared the Sun journalists.</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid to say that this Impress code is wholly unimpressive.</p> <p>*To respond to the draft code, either fill out <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/IMPRESSdraftStandardsCode\">the online survey</a> or write, via email, <a>info@impress.press</a>, or by post to Impress, 83 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0HW (<a href=\"http://impress-press.php5.hostingweb.co.uk/downloads/file/impress-draft-standards-code-consultation.docx\">More details here</a>)</p> <p><strong>PS: </strong>The Guardian, the Observer, Financial Times, the Independent and London Evening Standard are not regulated by either Ipso or Impress.

  "<p>And so, after all the delays and rumours and teasers and the DIY-themed live streams, Frank Ocean\u2019s new album is finally here! What, I hear you ask, is Boys Don\u2019t Cry actually like? </p> <p>Erm, we don\u2019t really know. Because Frank Ocean being Frank Ocean, the album he has put out isn\u2019t Boys Don\u2019t Cry.

Apparently, it is one big teaser \u2013 the teaser to end all teasers, if you will \u2013 before the real thing, with a brand-new title, arrives this weekend. Although haven\u2019t we heard that before?</p> <p>So what, I hear you ask \u2013 perhaps with a slightly less patient tone than before \u2013 is Endless like? And what the bloody hell is a \u201cvisual album\u201d?<br></p> <p>To answer the second question, the 18 tracks here have been released as one long video in which Ocean appears to get back on the home improvements game. We see him building a spiral staircase in his warehouse, while rocking various outfits \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/05/going-alone-why-frank-ocean-style-matters\">an impressively baggy Jesus and Mary Chain sweater</a> to a protective suit \u2013 as the music drifts by. And it really does drift, with brief instrumentals such as Ambience 001: In a Certain Way and the Daft Punk-sampling Hublots acting as segues. They also double up as palette-cleansers throughout what is a rich, varied and \u2013 at times \u2013 challenging musical feast. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/04/decoding-frank-ocean-secret-messages-boomboxes-boys-dont-cry\">Decoding Frank Ocean: secret messages, boomboxes and Boys Don't Cry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because Endless isn\u2019t always an easy listen. There are computerised voices (arty curtain-raiser Device Control), hazy electronic shimmers (In Here Somewhere) and the odd snippet of conversation littered across Endless, the latter providing a pleasingly lo-fi counterbalance to what is overall a rather futuristic and lush aesthetic (the London Contemporary Orchestra provide a variety of sumptuous strings). Song structures are often free-form, especially through the second half of the record, where the point at which one song ends and another begins is difficult to keep track of. Strangest of all is the final track, Higgs, which seems to be a spoken-word advert for a Samsung Galaxy phone, read aloud by German artist <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/08/wolfgang-tillmans-eu-referendum-remain-campaign-posters\">Wolfgang Tillmans</a> over pulsing electronica.

There are clearly songs here, as proved by the swooning synth lines on Commes Des Gar\u00e7ons, or the reggae-tinged Slide On Me, staged over a skittering rhythm and acoustic guitar. It\u2019s just that these tracks have the tendency to dissolve into cut-up voices, or pitch shifts, or electronic bleeps. That\u2019s certainly the case on Alabama, but that shouldn\u2019t discount the fact it also features Sampha\u2019s gorgeously plaintive question: \u201cWhat can I do to love you more than I do now?\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e63e6367e928c7d83d0c8e8e4a260c8c6c24ee93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e63e6367e928c7d83d0c8e8e4a260c8c6c24ee93/0_0_1198_719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not your average pop star \u2026 A still from Frank Ocean\u2019s Boys Don\u2019t Cry stream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not your average pop star \u2026 a still from Frank Ocean\u2019s Boys Don\u2019t Cry stream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: boysdontcry.co</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, soulful melody is in no short supply throughout Endless, and Ocean\u2019s voice ensures it\u2019s delivered more passionately than any other mainstream pop star is managing right now. You realise how much you\u2019ve missed that devastating falsetto the second it hovers into view on a cover of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWa2W1RCyvI\">Isley Brothers\u2019 1976 hit At Your Best (You Are Love)</a>. As Ocean gets busy with a circular saw (those stairs won\u2019t build themselves, you know), the track embodies the merging of R&amp;B and sadboy electronica that\u2019s been developing ever since Ocean first emerged. (Hardcore Frankophiles will have heard a slightly different version in a 2015 tribute to Aaliyah.) The influence of James Blake, Sampha and Jonny Greenwood would have been heavily present here even if those artists hadn\u2019t appeared on Endless.</p> <p>Of course, your view of Endless may well depend on how you approach it. If you\u2019re expecting a conveyor belt line of hits, then you will be somewhat disappointed as much of this album floats by hazily and with no clear direction. Endless feels like an artistic statement before a pop album, even if it\u2019s ultimately an impressive merging of the two. You might wonder at times \u2013 perhaps as beats flicker by and Ocean starts sanding down a particularly rough piece of wood \u2013 what on earth is going on. But surely the whole point of Frank Ocean is that he likes to confound, and this really does feel like a brilliantly confounding, unique piece of work.</p> <p>And besides, the full pop Frank will undoubtedly be unveiled when whatever Boys Don\u2019t Cry is now called emerges. Probably. Possibly. Who knows with this most mysterious and intriguing of artists? All we can say for sure is that there are rumours that an image of Ocean\u2019s face is gradually being projected on to the John Lewis store in Peterborough, along with a countdown clock to a date in March 2018, when etc etc etc. </p>",

Beckham could not only could run all day and all night but wanted to do so: when he was an apprentice at United, living in digs after moving to Manchester on his own at the age of 15, he would train in the morning and afternoon and then turn up in the evening to join in with the schoolboys.</p> <p>Ferguson eased Beckham into the first team on the right-hand side of midfield, away from the muck and bullets. He made his debut as a substitute in the League Cup at Brighton in 1992, when he was 17, but did not appear in the league until 1995. A series of events that year opened doors for Beckham. Gillespie, a revelation in his early first-team appearances, was sold to Newcastle as part of the deal to sign Andy Cole; the only reason Ferguson let him go was because of the foreigner rule in the Champions League, not knowing it would be abolished later in the year. Then Andrei Kanchelskis moved to Everton in mysterious and sinister circumstances. Darren Anderton turned down the chance to replace him, and Nottingham Forest would not sell Steve Stone.</p> <p>That left Beckham competing with Lee Sharpe, an unnatural and reluctant right winger, and he was a regular by the end of the 1995-96 season as United overhauled Newcastle\u2019s huge lead on the way to winning the Double. He scored the winner against Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final and two goals in the 5-0 victory over Nottingham Forest that helped tip Keegan over the edge. There was also a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcJDNuLkcrY#t=0m28s\">thrilling stamp of class</a> in league goals against Chelsea and particularly the defending champions Blackburn, a chip on the turn that left Ferguson running around the dugout in his suit, eyes ablaze like a man who had seen a trailer for the next 10 years.</p> <p>Beckham was nowhere near the Euro 96 squad \u2013 only the Neville brothers made it from the whole United team, never mind just the Class of 92 \u2013 and spent his summer on holiday in Sardinia, eating pasta every day and bathing in the realisation that he was now a bona fide Manchester United player.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/05/cristiano-ronaldo-goal-manchester-united-arsenal-2009\">Golden Goal: Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United v Arsenal (2009) | Rob Smyth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While he was away, Karel Poborsky was wowing Ferguson with his performances on the wing for the Czech Republic at Euro 96. He gave Paolo Maldini a serious chasing in the win over Italy and beat Portugal in the quarter-final with that ingenious scoop. <strong> </strong>\u201cHis hair may well get on my nerves if I sign him,\u201d wrote Ferguson in his season diary, \u201cbut he can definitely play.\u201d</p> <p>This is not to say Ferguson did not have plans for Beckham; he was ahead of the rest of the country in his use of rotation, and bought five players that summer \u2013 the others were Ronny Johnsen, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Jordi Cruyff and Raimond van der Gouw \u2013 to strengthen his pool with a heavy schedule in mind. \u201cIt\u2019s about going for the Triple!\u201d he chirped in Sky\u2019s pre-season advert.</p> <p>Whatever Ferguson\u2019s plans were, Beckham soon altered them. In the Charity Shield against Newcastle, Ferguson named the same side that had started the FA Cup final which meant no place for Poborsky or Cruyff. United slaughtered Newcastle 4-0 and Beckham, both on the wing and in the centre after an injury to Butt, was electric. He made two and scored a fine lob. His joyous celebration might seem excessive given the status of the game, until you remember that Beckham was a football nut who had just scored at Wembley for the first time. In the early part of his career, Beckham celebrated all his goals in the same way, with a boyish smile that reflected his disbelief that he was scoring goals for Manchester United. Innocence is finite; Beckham\u2019s would die within the week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0faee94a76f47be728ccb96ab30cdc33bf7efc61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0faee94a76f47be728ccb96ab30cdc33bf7efc61/394_242_3826_2297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Beckham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Beckham celebrates his superb lob against Newcastle in the 1996 Charity Shield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The greatest goal of all time\u2019</h2> <p> Six days after the Charity Shield, United started the season against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park. Beckham was trying out some new footwear; having heard good things about Predator boots, he asked Adidas to send him some. The only ones they had in his size had been made for the Rangers midfielder Charlie Miller and <a href=\"http://cdn.soccerbible.com/images/archive/Retro-Rewind-Beckham-Pred-96-Img1.jpg\">had \u2018CHARLIE\u2019 embroidered on the red foldover tongue</a>. The United players took great pleasure in taking the piss out of Beckham before the match.</p> <p>Then they took the piss out of Wimbledon. The game was, as Roy Keane put it, \u201ca stroll in the sun\u201d. Keane, who had just started a six-year period in which he easily was the best player in England, produced a performance of complete authority, leaving Vinnie Jones panting in his slipstream in the build-up to Eric Cantona\u2019s opening goal and creating the second for Denis Irwin. With United 2-0 up and the match petering out, the debutant Cruyff spotted Sullivan off his line and tried to chip him from distance. Had it been on target, he would probably have scored. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/nov/29/beckham-scholes-giggs-manchester-united-class-of-92-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3kz44\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2005591\"            data-video-name=\"Class of '92: watch David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs talk about playing for Manchester United\"            data-video-provider=\"Universal/Arts Alliance\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/11/29/1385731106661/David-Beckham-in-a-still--012.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-423708267\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/11/29/1385731106661/David-Beckham-in-a-still--012.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/11/29/131129Classof92-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/11/29/131129Classof92/131129Classof92.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/11/29/131129Classof92_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/11/29/131129Classof92_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2013/11/29/131129Classof92.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/nov/29/beckham-scholes-giggs-manchester-united-class-of-92-video\">Class of \u201892: watch David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs talk about playing for Manchester United</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The match was in injury time when Efan Ekoku was tackled by Johnsen. The ball came to Brian McClair, who poked it a few yards forward to Beckham near the halfway line. He let the ball run past him, looked up to see Sullivan well off his line, and thought: \u2018Why not?\u2019</p> <p>Beckham had developed a unique ball-striking technique: standing foot planted at an angle very close to the ball, left arm thrown to the side, and the right foot coming through the ball like a lumberjack\u2019s axe. When he crossed the ball he would whip around it or drive it with the top of the foot, yet his goal at Wimbledon was more of a sidefooted drive. He passed it into the net \u2013 from 55 yards. His precision was such that it hit the back of the net on the full. \u201cHe practised that in training every single day,\u201d said Gary Neville, \u201cstriking the ball towards a goal from the halfway line.\u201d</p> <p> The story goes that, as Beckham shaped to shoot, Ferguson said \u201cTrust him!\u201d In Ferguson\u2019s diary of the season, he says it was Brian Kidd. Either way, the reaction that meant so much to Beckham was that of Cantona, who was both an idol and a team-mate to the Class of 92. When he said, \u201cGood goal, David\u201d, it was like receiving approval from on high.</p> <p>Nobody could recall a similar goal in English football. There were some that had a bit in common, most notably Nayim against Arsenal, but none where a player had deliberately lobbed a goalkeeper from inside his own half. Pel\u00e9 had just missed with a similar attempt against Czechoslovakia in the 1970 World Cup; for most, that was the only reference point. Later that season, when discussing Beckham\u2019s burgeoning fame, the England manager, Glenn Hoddle, said \u201ca lot of things may be relayed back to the Pel\u00e9 situation\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2e284b976d72be55dc22678d95bd67cd3104456\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2e284b976d72be55dc22678d95bd67cd3104456/0_308_3260_4068/801.jpg\" alt=\"David Beckham\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beckham raises his hands after scoring from the halfway line against Wimbledon in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In August 1996, the information superhighway was in its infancy, so few people knew that a young Rivaldo had changed his own life <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF77hXwZH98\">by scoring from the halfway line in 1993</a>, and that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmeN0GFQGg4\">Albacete\u2019s Uruguayan midfielder Jos\u00e9 Luis Zalazar had done it more than once</a>. Jordi Cruyff remembered Zalazar, and mentioned him in post-match interviews, but the history lesson fell on deaf ears: the story was that a good-looking English kid had done what Pel\u00e9 could not, and no bloody Albacete midfielder with a foot like a traction engine was going to get in the way of that. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no argument David Beckham\u2019s unbelievable strike will be the goal of the season,\u201d said the News of the World. \u201cThe only debate is whether it is the greatest goal ever.\u201d That may look silly now, but at the time it was a fairly common view. \u201cYou have seen the goal of the season already,\u201d announced Ferguson. \u201cI have never seen it done before. Pel\u00e9 is the only one who came close to doing the same. Nayim? That was a miskick. But Beckham? It was marvellous. A truly tremendous strike. When you have a shot like he has, it will always be worth a try.\u201d</p> <p>In the 20 years since, every Tom, Dick and Xabi has tried it and many have succeeded. It isn\u2019t a surprise anymore and nor should it be, given the ball-striking ability of modern players. But back then it was a huge thing, which meant a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Nash#Gary_Sobers.27_six_sixes\">Malcolm Nashish celebrity</a> for the keeper Sullivan. It got worse when, four days later, David Batty also made a Gilbert out of Sullivan by lobbing him from 40 yards. Sullivan kept watching Beckham\u2019s goal on VHS to see if he could have done anything differently. Eventually he got bored and taped over it with EastEnders. </p> <h2>Centre of attention</h2> <p>\u201cGood evening. It\u2019s only 47 days since Euro 96. I still think the Germans were lucky.\u201d That\u2019s how Des Lynam started the first Match of the Day of the 1996-97 season. They were optimistic times in English football; Euro 96 had completed the gentrification and glamourisation of the game that started at Italia 90, Cool Britannia was still going strong, and Fabrizio Ravanelli and Gianluca Vialli \u2013 signed from the European champions Juventus \u2013 led the list of exciting foreign additions.</p> <p>The context contributed to the impact of Beckham\u2019s goal. English football was full of brilliant young players and Beckham became the face of that generation. After the match, Ferguson blocked him from doing a Match of the Day interview. He had successfully sheltered Ryan Giggs from the limelight but Beckham was different, and from that moment Ferguson was fighting a losing battle in attempting to control the uncontrollable. When Beckham did his first press conference a fortnight later while on England duty, Ferguson was apparently furious. A few months later, after a team night out at the cinema, Ferguson was appalled to see that Beckham was all over the tabloids - because he had worn a pair of glasses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43e3c75ba350d5d9848380f5ce67dce568508ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43e3c75ba350d5d9848380f5ce67dce568508ed1/0_91_1819_1091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Beckham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Beckham during England training in February 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh / Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe is a footballer,\u201d Hoddle said at that first press conference. \u201cHe\u2019ll get paid the rest of his life, and get acclaimed, for what he does on the football pitch, not off it. Those things spin off because you are playing well on the pitch for the next 10 years, not the next 10 months.\u201d It\u2019s easy to sneer with hindsight, but the comments were entirely sensible \u2013 not even Mystic Meg could have envisaged the level of fame that Beckham would subsequently achieve.</p> <p>At that time, he was just a kid from the East End made good. He was earning \u00a32,000 a week at United and found out England about his call-up on Teletext while at his parents\u2019 house. In the next year he signed a new contract at United and lucrative deals with, among others, Adidas and Brylcreem. And he met Victoria Adams.</p> <p>The goal did not just raise Beckham\u2019s profile; it gave him a long-lasting injection of confidence and swagger; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eV6hhDyKEk#t=6m38\">his part in Poborsky\u2019s gorgeous goal against Leeds</a> at the start of September was indicative of a player who had taken a shortcut from promising to seriously good. He kept trying things, they kept coming off, and the whole thing perpetuated itself throughout one of the happiest seasons of his career.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bddac571f043773471538deb0abc21d10403dadf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bddac571f043773471538deb0abc21d10403dadf/0_66_2208_1324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Beckham, Alan Shearer and Peter Beardsley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Beckham, Alan Shearer and Peter Beardsley at the PFA Awards in April 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Stephens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the exception of the Treble year, this was easily his best campaign at United. He won the Young Player of the Year award and finished second to Alan Shearer in the senior award. It was also the only time he won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award at United. But he didn\u2019t, as everybody predicted, win Goal of the Season: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpXWKKOVQWs\">that went to Trevor Sinclair for his staggering overhead kick against Barnsley</a>.</p> <p>Beckham could have had his personal Goal of the Season competition. Few players have ever produced such a portfolio of belters in one campaign: aside from Wimbledon, personal favourites are the improvised chip at West Ham, the rasper against Liverpool and the swirling matchwinner at Spurs. There were also memorable free-kicks and a 98mph volley at Chelsea when he knew Victoria Adams was in the crowd. He met her for the first time after the game.</p> <p>United won the league with 75 points, the lowest total of the Premier League era. They were distracted by an intrepid run to the European Cup semi-finals, which they achieved despite losing three of their group games. Playing in Europe, said Beckham, was \u201ca bit like learning football all over again\u201d. With Keane and Butt injured for parts of the season, Beckham played many of his matches in central midfield \u2013 including big wins over Arsenal, home and away, Porto and Liverpool. Almost everybody saw that as his long-term position. His dynamic running and long-range shooting led to comparisons with Sir Bobby Charlton \u2013 from Charlton himself. The subtlety of his passing and his ability to impose himself on games led many to anoint him as the heir to Paul Gascoigne</p> <p>At that stage Paul Scholes struggled to get into the United team and was slowly being changed from a No10 to a No8 by Ferguson. Beckham was recognised more for his passing than his crossing \u2013 occasionally they blended into one, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1eWyJ5dzns#t=1m15s\">as with the glorious assist against Rapid Vienna in the European Cup</a>) \u2013 and it was only the following season, when Poborsky was sold and Scholes became a regular, that Beckham started to become an assist monster on the wing.</p> <p>There are plenty who think Beckham would never have made a central midfielder. It\u2019s a questionable appraisal. When he played there on a semi-regular basis for the only time in 1996-97, and was still young enough to maraud up and down the pitch rather than sit as a quarterback, he excelled. He was also Manchester United\u2019s best player in that position in the 1999 Champions League final. His defensive awareness and short-passing game needed a little development, but then it\u2019s reasonable to assume they would have developed had he stayed in that position. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcJDNuLkcrY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NcJDNuLkcrY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=135\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The suspicion is that, with his passing, driving runs and indefatigability, his shooting and his desire to dominate games, he would have been a brilliant central midfielder. He was an even better winger, however, and quickly became typecast. There\u2019s a lot of tedious revisionism about how good Beckham was, but there has never been a better crosser of the ball and for most of his Manchester United career he was magnificent. It\u2019s easy to forget that he was runner-up in the Ballon d\u2019Or in 1999 and twice in the Fifa World Player of the Year award.</p> <p>Though there was and is considerable mutual affection, his relationship with Ferguson became increasingly strained as his celebrity grew. \u201cDavid was the only player I managed who chose to be famous,\u201d said Ferguson, \u201cwho made it his mission to be known outside the game.\u201d</p> <p>In the second half of the 1999-2000 season he was omitted from a huge game at Leeds after reporting late for training because his son Brooklyn was ill, and then came the first of many front-page haircuts \u2013 a shaven head that he unveiled at Leicester. Beckham wore a beanie the night before, even during the team meal in a restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqp1bGuiHHs\">which prompted Ferguson to have his own Tony Soprano moment</a> and tell him to take it off . Beckham declined. The next day Ferguson told him that, if he didn\u2019t take it off for the warm-up, he wouldn\u2019t be playing. \u201cAt that stage,\u201d said Ferguson, \u201cI was starting to despair of him.\u201d<br></p> <p>Beckham eventually left in 2003,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/22/ferguson-david-beckham-sold-boot-kicking-book\"> a few months after the dressing-room incident that left him with a cut above the eye</a>. Ferguson was tired of the circus; more importantly, he was content that he had a superior replacement in Solskjaer, who had usurped Beckham during the 2002-03 season. His crossing was excellent, his goal threat greater and his Thomas M\u00fcller-like movement suited the way Ferguson wanted to develop his team. United\u2019s lost years of 2003-06 might have been a bit different had Solskjaer not suffered a dreadful injury at the start of the first post-Beckham season.</p> <p>Ferguson thinks Beckham\u2019s lifestyle denied him \u201cthe chance to become absolute top-dog player\u201d. That may be so, though even Beckham probably doesn\u2019t know the extent to which his lifestyle impacted upon his career. And what has happened since brings to mind <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4312792.stm\">the old story about George Best and the hotel waiter</a>: Mr Beckham, where did it all go wrong?</p> <p>In 2016, if you type \u2018Beckham\u2019 and \u2018Wimbledon\u2019 into Google, the first results you get are about his trip to the tennis along with other celebrities like Beyonce, Cliff Richard and Heidi Klum.

  "<p>When Sharina Smith arrived back home in Sherman Park, Milwaukee, on Wednesday after a decade living out of state, some things had changed irreversibly. Her 23-year-old cousin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database#sylville-smith-2016668\">Sylville Smith</a>, was dead. Killed by a city police officer last Saturday after he ran from a traffic stop and allegedly pointed a gun. The gas station close to the family\u2019s daily vigils was now a pile of rubble and ash, burned in the riots that followed Smith\u2019s death.</p> <p>But of the many things in the neighbourhood that had remained constant, Smith spoke about one in particular: the crippling poverty. </p> <p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t gotten any better. It hasn\u2019t changed. People are outraged because of it. They get no attention, no help,\u201d Smith, 32, said. \u201cThat\u2019s why people were out on the those streets. My cousin\u2019s death was one more thing.\u201d </p> <p>In this overwhelmingly African American neighbourhood, in one of America\u2019s most racially segregated cities, more than <a href=\"http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Sherman-Park-Milwaukee-WI.html\">43% of residents live in poverty</a>. The schools here are worse off. The employment prospects more bleak. Public transport is lacking. Rent <a href=\"https://www.biztimes.com/2016/07/13/milwaukee-has-largest-rent-increase-in-nation-study-shows/\">is going up</a>. This summer tensions between local young people and police simmered following a spate of minor clashes inside the 20-acre park, which sits in the centre of the neighbourhood. Smith\u2019s death proved to be the event that tipped some people over the edge. </p> <p>\u201cIt used to be different,\u201d said state assemblyman David Bowen, a 29-year-old African American who has lived in the neighbourhood his entire life. He strolled along the neatly kept grass and pointed to the prime housing stock, built during the industrial boom years of the 1920s, which faces inwards towards the park. Once owner occupied, these units are now mostly rented and many are in a state of disrepair. </p> <p>\u201cDecades ago it was the norm to make enough that you weren\u2019t thinking about whether to buy your food or pay your rent.\u201d </p> <p>Like many major cities in the US, including Detroit, Pittsburgh and Buffalo, Milwaukee saw an ascendancy through a manufacturing boom in the mid-20th century, followed by a sharp slump accompanied by urban decay. In the wake of globalization, domestic competition and industrial automation, these cities have experienced high crime rates, high unemployment and increased drug addiction. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6164d751cd2b66e62dc1c838eea146f97e3b6f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6164d751cd2b66e62dc1c838eea146f97e3b6f6e/0_118_3309_1986/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milwaukee building\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman with children walk past the boarded up BMO Harris bank following a shooting death by police in Milwaukee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Hauck/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Sherman Park neighbourhood was once celebrated as a standout success within Milwaukee during the 1970s for its racial integration and multicultural community-building. </p> <p>African Americans who had moved into the area among tens of thousands driven to Milwaukee to escape the south\u2019s racist violence mixed among the existing Irish-Catholic, German-Lutheran and Jewish communities. Problems persisted; life was by no means perfect. But things felt better than in other neighbourhoods nearby.</p> <p>Sherman Park\u2019s school district stood alone within the city by opposing racial segregation and busing while Milwaukee fought to preserve it in the face of a federal court order in 1976, according to Paul Geenen, a former long-time resident and local historian. Mixed-race soccer teams and block parties were effective threads tying the community together. But now the public schools in Milwaukee <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/16/us/milwaukee-sherman-park-community/\">are almost as segregated as they were five decades ago</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWe were respectable. It was mixed, white and black, we all got along together. I had black and white classmates at school,\u201d said 61-year-old Geoffrey Pugh, an African American who was born in the neighbourhood and spent decades here before moving away in the 1980s only to return four years ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lost generation now. Babies raising babies.\u201d</p> <p>Two key developments in more recent decades radically altered the neighbourhood\u2019s course, according to Geenen. </p> <p>One was the sharp decline in local manufacturing industries that had provided steady employment for a racially diverse blue-collar population, including for many black men. Between 1979 and 1984 Milwaukee lost 50,000 jobs \u2013 more than it did during the Great Depression. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a717438514431a9c3bef41a2bd2d5c8668346432\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a717438514431a9c3bef41a2bd2d5c8668346432/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A disused building is seen near the Sherman Park neighborhood in Milwaukee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A disused building is seen near the Sherman Park neighborhood in Milwaukee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron P Bernstein/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most prominent was Allis-Chalmers, a heavy machinery manufacturer with roots in Milwaukee reaching back into the mid-19th century.

The park itself was encircled in plastic red mesh fencing and has been closed from 6pm every evening, drawing the ire of many local residents. The order was made by the controversial Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke, a close ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Clarke, who is black, recently described the Black Lives Matter movement as a national security threat on the same level as terrorist organisations, including Isis. </p> <p>As dusk fell on Wednesday, the Democratic Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett arrived in a large SUV and attempted to offer members of the Smith family condolences. Only one agreed to shake the mayor\u2019s hand and Barrett left within minutes of arriving. </p> <p>The circumstances surrounding Sylville Smith\u2019s death remain unclear. Police maintain that the 23-year-old, who had an extensive criminal record, pointed a semi-automatic handgun at a black officer before he was shot dead. But family members say he was not armed at the time he was killed and that the officer, who has been named in unconfirmed reports, had known Smith since high school. They allege the pair may have previously been involved in a romantic dispute. Body camera footage of the incident has not been released. </p> <p>At least one man in America seemed certain he knew already what had occurred. Donald Trump visited Milwaukee on Tuesday and told Fox News: \u201cThe gun was pointed at his (a police officer\u2019s) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? That\u2019s what the narrative is.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not true. If it is true, people shouldn\u2019t be rioting.\u201d</p> <p>At a rally on Tuesday evening, 20 miles from Milwaukee in the white majority town of West Bend, Trump sought to capitalise on the unrest in a direct plea to black voters. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"568ec1b7ec1d2944837ed25dfb305a6b7c436e53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/568ec1b7ec1d2944837ed25dfb305a6b7c436e53/0_176_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milwaukee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police in riot gear assemble in an alley after disturbances following the police shooting of Sylville Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron P Bernstein/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe main victims of these riots are law-abiding African American citizens living in these neighbourhoods,\u201d Trump said, vowing to restore law and order to poor communities by increasing police presence. </p> <p>Sharina Smith was appalled. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want everyone to keep throwing Sylville\u2019s name into all these different acts of violence and things that\u2019s going on. We are just trying to grieve.\u201d </p> <p>Bowen, the state representative, couldn\u2019t help but see the irony: </p> <p>\u201cThe same individuals that champion the policies of cutting and cutting and cutting resources to these communities come back and say, \u2018now that you are in turmoil, and you\u2019re oppressed, we want to fix this problem. People can see through the hypocrisy. </p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t hold law enforcement agencies accountable to treat communities with respect and dignity, essentially what you\u2019re saying is that you should be allowed to be mistreated and we will continue to criminalise your community.\u201d </p> <p>Matthew Desmond, a Harvard sociologist and author of Evicted, an acclaimed study of poverty and the housing crisis in Milwaukee, said other recent fatal police shootings of African Americans in the city, such as Dontre Hamilton, an unarmed mentally ill man who was killed in 2014, have added to tensions. </p> <p>\u201cThese events are really critical and embed themselves in the collective memory of the people of northern Milwaukee,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6072ceb9bd18557ecf6cb575b7f9f59594472a9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6072ceb9bd18557ecf6cb575b7f9f59594472a9e/0_405_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milwaukee city damage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The remains of an auto parts store after police faced off with protesters following the death of Sylville Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cengiz Yar/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hamilton\u2019s mother, Maria, has spent the past days counselling the Smith family: \u201cIt kills me over and over again, each time another one of these shootings happen,\u201d she said. </p> <p>At the same time, Desmond specifically points to a chronic underfunding of federal housing assistance programs that has made it harder for people to escape the poverty they fall into. A majority of poor families who rent are spending half of their income or more on housing costs, he said, while one in four are spending 70%. </p> <p>According to Desmond, the resulting waves of eviction in the city and turnover of residents have eaten away at communities and left chaos where there may once have been cohesion. </p> <p>\u201cWe know that when neighbours work together they can really make a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve allowed a situation where neighbours will remain strangers because there\u2019s so much instability. It has serious consequences.\u201d</p> <p>An informal community alliance had been patrolling Sherman Park since mid-June, after local youths reported that police officers had been moving them out of the park, and making occasional arrests without cause. The disturbances gradually got worse and led to clashes with riot police in July and vandalism of local businesses. Last month a store attendant at the gas station that was targeted over the weekend riots fired shots at a group of youths he claimed had been harassing him. </p> <p>The founder of these informal patrols, 29-year-old Vauhn Mayes, argued that the juveniles involved simply had nowhere else to go in the evenings. The initiative, funded entirely by community donations, started evening cookouts and activity groups. Mayes said that for many of the youths who attended, it was their only chance to eat a proper meal. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re waking up to a problem that has been simmering for a long time,\u201d said Desmond. \u201cAnd it is now boiling over.\u201d </p> <p><br></p>",

While some drugs are considered relatively safe the evidence is not conclusive, and some have been linked to health problems in babies. </p> <p>But those who come off any medication are at risk of getting ill again: for example, seven out of every <a href=\"http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/mentalhealthinpregnancy.aspx\">10 women who stop antidepressants in early pregnancy become unwell again</a>.</p> <p>Harriet, 32, Stoke-on-Trent</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Giving birth was much more painful and difficult than I ever imagined it would be</p> <footer> <cite>Harriet</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have been told that I may need medication for life to treat my anxiety and depression. When I decided to have a baby, my main fear was that the drugs would be dangerous and I\u2019d have to come off them. I was scared of falling ill, which had happened when I came off medication before \u2013 when I was at my worst I had extreme panic attacks about 10 times a day.</p> <p>My dad, who is a doctor, assured me that citalopram <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/antidepressants/art-20046420\">is generally considered OK during pregnancy</a>. But babies born to depressed mothers can have worse growth and general health. </p> <p>I talked to my husband and I decided it was safer for me to stay on the drugs. However, I still found the pregnancy very stressful. I worried constantly about miscarrying. I was offered a reassurance scan but it made me more stressed because they noticed a slight abnormality in the baby\u2019s brain. It turned out to be nothing, but I completely broke down. I could not function for weeks and struggled with the rest of the pregnancy. </p> <p>Since the birth my mental health has improved. I love being a mum and my daughter makes me very happy. Giving birth was much more painful and difficult than I ever imagined it would be. Afterwards, you wake up to a life and a body that you don\u2019t recognise.

I stopped taking my medication (Escitalopram) when I was pregnant because I was worried about the health of my baby. Some doctors thought it was better I stay on the drug, while others disagreed, and because of this varying advice I stopped. However, coming off it caused me a lot of problems. I started self-harming, for example, and worried about everything. I ended up hiding in my house, which meant I couldn\u2019t go back to work. With borderline personality disorder I can go very quickly from being level-headed to mentally unstable. Being pregnant made it harder to cope with this. I didn\u2019t feel like my body was my own. I couldn\u2019t harm myself physically to rid my mind of distressing thoughts.</p> <p>I was referred to a mental health assessment team and put back on medication on a low dosage. I had one visit with the assessment team but found the nurse dismissive and unhelpful. They didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d had past mental health problems and were treating me as if I had just turned up with thoughts of harming myself. Once I explained to them that I presented before pregnancy I hoped they\u2019d adjust their attitude towards me, perhaps offer more contact, but they didn\u2019t.</p> <p>I coped throughout the pregnancy mainly thanks to my husband and my GP, who I could talk more openly with, but I wish there had been more support from the assessment team. </p> </blockquote> <p>Hannah from Yorkshire experienced anxiety before pregnancy, but chose to come off medication to treat this in order to have a child.

Friends from abroad are often shocked at how few scans we get in the UK and that the chance to hear the baby\u2019s heartbeat at midwife appointments isn\u2019t standardised across the country.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Postnatal</h2> <p>Postnatal depression is an illness that affects between <a href=\"http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/mentalhealthinpregnancy.aspx\">10 to 15 in every 100 women having a baby</a>. It can start within one or two months of giving birth. It\u2019s also something that hits men too: studies predict about <a href=\"https://www.nct.org.uk/parenting/postnatal-depression-dads\">one dad in 10 has postnatal depression</a>. Traditionally, the mother\u2019s mental health gets more attention, but recognition of the dad\u2019s mental health is increasing.</p> <p>Alice, Midlands</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I had my daughter a few years ago and read all the information I could get my hands on. After a difficult birth I eventually delivered my baby. I was exhausted (it took 48 hours in total) and shell-shocked. We stayed in hospital for a few days while trying to get my daughter to breastfeed. I was struggling so much with this that I refused to have any visitors as I didn\u2019t want anyone to think I couldn\u2019t cope. In the end I gave up so that we could all just go home. Luckily bottle feeding didn\u2019t affect bonding with my baby. </p> <p>However, my partner didn\u2019t cope well at all. From seeing me in so much pain and out of control, he tried to take on far too much so that I could recover. His mental health spiralled as a result to the point where he couldn\u2019t look at our baby. He couldn\u2019t handle her crying and one day I found him crouched in a corner rocking. I got him to see a counsellor and the doctor advised that he would recover better if he moved out for a while. He went to live with his parents and we would visit, but he couldn\u2019t cope with the guilt of leaving us. </p> <p>Eventually we got through it and he was able to move back home with us. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t make it as a couple; the strain was too much. Looking back I wish we\u2019d have had more support in trying to deal with his depression but even though this was a few years ago, there was very little awareness about male postnatal depression and a lot of shame attached to it. I wish I could have helped more.</p> </blockquote> <p>Emma, Manchester</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019d already had a baby and enjoyed being a mum, so when I fell pregnant again I never expected to experience postnatal depression.It was four months before I plucked up the courage to go and see the doctor. I kept telling myself to keep going, and that I could be a perfect mum like the ones you see plastered all over social media. Now I realise that it\u2019s not real. To me, during the dark days that perfect picture wasn\u2019t my life but boy did I try to achieve it. I was really struggling and I told no one. Admitting weakness was like putting my hand up and saying: \u201cLook at me, the bad mum over here.\u201d</p> <p>The day I told my sister and my mum I was at my wits\u2019 end. I cried the whole time. I paced the length of my house for half an hour before I finally made the call to my family. After that I went to the doctor. I thought he was going to laugh and tell me to just get on with it like every other mum, but he didn\u2019t. He told me that this would be the last time I would feel this way and that every day, from today, I would start to feel better. Most importantly he made me realise for the first time in four months that I wasn\u2019t a failing mother-of-two. I\u2019d managed to keep my head above water through one of the most challenging times of my life.</p> <p>We discussed options and I agreed that I would take tablets for depression and anxiety \u2013 it was time to give my body a little helping hand. He made me see some things are out of my control and postnatal depression can happen to anyone. <br></p> </blockquote> <h2>Psychosis </h2> <p>One of the most severe forms of illness seen in psychiatry are postpartum psychoses. In rare but tragic cases it can lead to women taking their own lives.It\u2019s thought that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109493/\">postpartum psychosis affects women in every 1-2 of 1,000 births</a>. It\u2019s more likely to affect women who have had it before (or have a relative who has) or have a serious mental health condition, such as <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Bipolar-disorder/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">bipolar disorder</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Schizophrenia/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">schizophrenia</a>. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f89c3c34aeba48f1685ed7e306a699ce5ff0a09a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f89c3c34aeba48f1685ed7e306a699ce5ff0a09a/0_0_2667_4000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Abramson 2013 Pregnant\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Abramson, who suffered from postpartum depression after the birth of her daughter</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisa (Friedrichs) Abramson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lisa Abramson, from San Francisco, experienced severe mental health difficulties after giving birth to her first child.

I also wrote lists compulsively and used hand gestures, which I don\u2019t normally do \u2026 then after that I became psychotic. I completely lost touch with reality and was convinced my phone was communicating with me in code. I thought it might be my father who had died three years previously. I thought I would just will with my mind ordering a pizza and it would be delivered to the door.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Post-traumatic stress disorder</h2> <p>Research is limited but estimates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after delivery tend to be around 1-2% in high-income countries. One study in Sweden <a href=\"http://www.birthtraumaassociation.org.uk/publications/post_natal_ptsd.pdf\">put the rate of postnatal PTSD at 2% in the first year after birth</a>. While some women experience it after a particularly traumatic birth (with medical difficulties), others have PTSD from the birth process itself. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the Birth Trauma Association said: \u201cThe help on offer for women is very patchy and generally poor. Individual health visitors and midwives may help but waiting lists are long \u2013 up to a year \u2013 and almost no one gets on a list for cognitive behaviour therapy or other treatment unless they have been symptomatic for at least 12 weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Bill, Staffordshire</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My wife and I experienced the stillbirth of our first child, Andrew. It was very sudden, my wife noticed a lack of movement and we went to hospital. We saw a classic scan, but this time with no heartbeat. I carry the image with me to this day. The following days and weeks were traumatic. We were told that the chances of a future successful pregnancy were higher if my wife delivered Andrew naturally, so labour was induced gently. We then went to a dedicated maternity suite (where we were handled with exceptional care and attention by all staff). The delivery was normal, except that Andrew was not alive.<br></p> <p>Following the stillbirth, I experienced post-traumatic stress disorder for which I have since received cognitive behavioural therapy. I had flash-backs of the traumatic delivery and the events immediately before and after, including my son\u2019s funeral. I also suffered from an intense anxiety as we went through four more pregnancies \u2013 two ended in miscarriage and two ended inthe births of two wonderful boys. We constantly wondered about miscarriage, stillbirth and the chances of a good outcome. The mental health problems affected my work \u2013 I was constantly on high alert. </p> <p>On the whole the NHS was marvellous. Their care when we lost Andrew was excellent in the circumstances. My wife got support during the pregnancies and for the way in which the stillbirth affected her. However, there was less attention on the father. I was not prepared mentally for the immense impact that this would have on me. </p> </blockquote>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On the whole the NHS was marvellous.

I didn\u2019t understand what was happening, so tried to carry on as normal. I became pregnant again 14 months later by accident and really suffered. I believed I would die, writing letters to all my family and counting down the days until I would leave this world. I had awful anxiety, flashbacks and was terrified all the time. I didn\u2019t trust healthcare professionals, hated going to the hospital for appointments and didn\u2019t know who I could approach for help. I became a shell, empty and full of fear. </p> <p>I wish that my traumatic birth had been acknowledged and that I had been asked how I was coping in my next pregnancy. I wish that there had been counselling, more information around having a difficult birth. I wish I\u2019d just been asked how I was, not physically but mentally. I wish there had been continuity of care so that I had someone I trusted care for me. It took me 15 years to get a correct diagnosis after the second birth and even then there was no specialist treatment support available. <br></p> </blockquote> <h2>Obsessive compulsive disorder</h2> <p>It\u2019s thought to affect <a href=\"http://www.ocduk.org/prenatal-postnatal-ocd\">2-4% of all new mothers</a>, but \u2013 until recently \u2013 has received relatively little research attention. Some women develop obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) for the first time either during pregnancy or <a href=\"http://www.ocduk.org/prenatal-postnatal-ocd\">shortly afterwards, while others find it makes a pre-exisitng condition worse</a>. This is partly down to the fact that pregnancy is a time of increased stress, with most women becoming concerned about protecting their baby. It is a time of major physical change, which can cause difficulties.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s not just down to hormones, however, and some fathers also experience postnatal OCD because of their feeling of responsibility to protect their new baby.</p> <p>May, Birmingham</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was diagnosed with OCD following the birth of my first child. I was experiencing intrusive thoughts about my son coming to harm (and that I might actually be the one to harm him). I have suffered from recurrent depressive episodes throughout my life.This and the severe anxiety I was experiencing led me to spend a lot of my maternity leave sitting at home, waiting for something terrible to happen. </p> <p>My midwife noticed during my pregnancy that I was feeling anxious and referred me to a mental health clinic at the local women\u2019s hospital. I continued to attend there after my pregnancy and, as things spiralled out of control, I was prescribed antidepressants and given a place in a group therapy session. I was admitted to hospital \u2013 in a dedicated mother and baby unit \u2013 for two months as things failed to improve. <br></p> <p>The care I received was wonderful \u2013 I cannot fault it at all. I had never imagined that I might be suffering from OCD, and once I had my diagnosis and began cognitive behavioural therapy, the depressive episodes in the past began to make sense. I was treated with utter respect and kindness both as an outpatient and an inpatient, and have since been able to return to work. I feel very lucky that I had access to this service, and that it was so close to home. I know that this isn\u2019t the case for most women. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><em>\u2022 </em><em>Some names have been changed.</em><br></p> <p><em>\u2022 In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

They have both been massive figures in this club and we need to replace them with big figures. That\u2019s something that didn\u2019t always happen at Newcastle [when I was the manager], unfortunately.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased the board have been brave with this move. I thank them that we got it this far, although it\u2019s not complete. Benteke has a great pedigree. He\u2019s someone I know very well because I wanted to take him to Newcastle. I thought he\u2019d be a fantastic fit for that club.</p> <p>\u201cHe got the move to Liverpool and it hasn\u2019t quite worked out. For us, we need to get him back to doing what he does best. His style of play, the way he feeds off crosses \u2026 we\u2019re the top crossing team in the Premier League bar one, I think, so he\u2019ll enjoy that with the wide players we have. But he\u2019s not our player yet.\u201d</p> <p>Although Benteke ended last season with a slight knee problem, the fact Liverpool\u2019s players are examined when they return to pre-season training suggests the medical will not throw up unexpected issues. Likewise personal terms are not thought to be a problem for a player who commanded wages of about \u00a3120,000 a week at Anfield.</p> <p>Benteke will not be considered for selection in Saturday\u2019s game at Tottenham Hotspur but is likely to make his debut in Tuesday\u2019s League Cup tie against Blackpool at Selhurst Park, where James McArthur, James Tomkins and Steve Mandanda are also expected to play.</p> <p>Palace are still seeking to add another striker to their ranks, with interest maintained in Chelsea\u2019s Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my. The France international, who played for Pardew at Newcastle, is available for \u00a39m or on a 12-month loan with a fee of \u00a33m. Pardew will also seek a replacement for Bolasie out wide and still aspires to secure Moussa Sissoko from Newcastle.</p> <p>The Palace manager confirmed he had tried to persuade Bolasie to remain at the club, only for the DR Congo international to push to complete a \u00a325m move to Everton. \u201cBolasie leaving wasn\u2019t something I had planned because, of course, he would have been very much involved in the first team here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it got down to the end I asked him if there was anything we can do to keep him at the club. His response was \u2018no\u2019. He had made his mind up and I think with somebody like him, where he plays with his heart and soul, he needed to go.</p> <p>\u201cAgain, I\u2019ve worked hard with Bolasie in terms of technical parts of his game and I think he\u2019s improved, so I think it\u2019s a shame for that work to now be enjoyed by Everton. But they got him and we now look for a team that can score more goals and control the game better. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to try to evolve to.</p> <p>\u201cI asked him if there was anything we could do, to sit down with him [and talk about a new contract], but it wasn\u2019t really for him. He wanted a new concept and a new project. You have to accept that with players. It\u2019s difficult for the fans: they buy the shirt, they love the players. I had it at Newcastle. But, like all great players, there comes a time when the circumstances are that they move on. But you have to replace them. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d</p> <p>The \u00a34m sale of Jedinak, the 32-year-old Australia captain, was justified as part of Pardew\u2019s attempts to change the style of Palace\u2019s play. \u201cHe was our captain and a warrior of the highest order, somebody that will be a great signing for Aston Villa,\u201d he added. \u201cHe was captain of this team but I felt it was time for a change. Probably that change was going to affect his playing time here and he needs to play. He\u2019s not a sub. He\u2019s not a squad player. He will go and lead Aston Villa, I hope lead them to promotion.</p> <p>\u201cAfter our last game against West Brom the fans were disappointed. I had one saying to me, \u2018More of the same, Alan\u2019 as I walked off the pitch. But it won\u2019t be more of the same. That\u2019s the reason we\u2019re making changes.</p> <p>\u201cThe back-end of last year, the second half of last season was not good enough for me or my staff. So I\u2019ve changed various things at the football club and I\u2019m making changes to try to take this club to a place where our home form is better, where results are more consistent, as well as our performances. This group of players are a great group to work with. I think they will get a lift, hopefully, by a new signing or two in the next few days.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Earth\u2019s biodiversity is under attack. We would need to travel back over 65 million years to find rates of species loss as high as we are witnessing today. </p> <p>Conservation often focuses on the big, enigmatic animals - tigers, polar bears, whales. There are many reasons to want to save these species from extinction. But what about the vast majority of life that we barely notice? The bugs and grubs that can appear or vanish from ecosystems without any apparent impact?</p> <p>Biodiversity increases resilience: more species means each individual species is better able to withstand impacts. Think of decreasing biodiversity as popping out rivets from an aircraft. A few missing rivets here or there will not cause too much harm. But continuing to remove them threatens a collapse in ecosystem functioning. Forests give way to desert. Coral reefs bleach and then die.</p> <p>New research that I have been involved in suggests that there biodiversity has a value that has been overlooked, but could be vitally important if we are to manage our impacts on ecosystems. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.1558/abstract\">Our study, published in the journal Ecology, </a>shows that crucial information about the overall health or resilience of an ecosystem may be lurking in data about supposedly inconsequential species. In fact, the presence or absence of some of the rarest species may be giving us important clues as to how near an ecosystem is to a potential collapse.</p> <p>Such rare species we call ecosystem canaries. Like canaries that coal miners used to check for poisonous gasses deep underground, ecosystem canaries are often the first species to disappear from a stressed ecosystem. Their vanishing can be linked to changes in the functioning of ecosystems, which can serve as a warning that a collapse is approaching.</p> <p>Our study used data collected from lakes in China that showed changes in the abundance of species from algae (diatom) and aquatic midges (chironomid) communities as they compete for resources under environmental pressures. From this data it was possible to identify three types of organism: slowly-replicating but strongly competitive \u2018keystone\u2019 species; weakly-competitive but fast-replicating \u2018weedy\u2019 species; and slowly-replicating and weakly-competitive \u2018canary\u2019 species.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c58772b0648d440cd64256c90d8154fdd501a41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c58772b0648d440cd64256c90d8154fdd501a41/0_0_3345_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the lakes mentioned in study Photo taken in July 2015 shows Erhai Lake in Dali, in southwest China\u2019s Yunnan Province.

The loss of keystones tips the ecosystem into a critical transition \u2013 the point at which a system shifts into an alternate state which in lakes is dominated by smothering algae and absence of many plant and animal species. Moving a lake back to a clear water, high biodiversity state can be extremely difficult.Better to avoid the collapse in the first place.</p> <p>Waiting to observe changes in the keystone species would not allow any intervention because the system would already be spiralling towards collapse. By searching for changes in the structure of populations that includes the ratio of keystone, weedy and canary species, we were able to detect a clear signal of an impending collapse many years, sometimes decades before the actual event. Time enough to put in place changes to farming and other practices.</p> <p>The ecological theory underpinning this approach should apply to many other aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Given the extent and rapidity of human impacts there should not be any shortage of ecosystems to apply our findings to.</p>",

Was it scary opening yourself up to that?</strong></p> <p>Amy Adams once said this thing that I remember all the time about how artists have to have a very thin skin. You have to be very emotionally ready, emotionally connected to everything but then, as a public figure, you have to have such a thick skin. People will say such harsh things (4). You need to be vulnerable for your work but you also need to be tough as nails just to keep up, and that combination is really hard to maintain.</p> <p><strong>Do you read reviews of your own films?</strong></p> <p>No. I avoid it. It\u2019s inhibiting to hear bad things about yourself. It makes you afraid, and you can\u2019t be afraid when you work.</p> <p><strong>So many actors hate watching themselves. How do you get past that?</strong></p> <p>I usually see a movie once when it comes out at the premiere and then never see it again. Usually I cringe through the premiere and hate everything I do.

  "<p>As London rightly celebrates another year of outstanding A-level results - the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/18/pupils-english-physics-a-levels-highest-grades-fall\">best in England</a>, except for the south-east - it\u2019s worth noting that some young talents in the capital, as no doubt elsewhere, may still not be fully recognised by the school examinations system. </p> <p>Next month will see the <a href=\"http://www.haringey.gov.uk/news/new-digital-skills-college-open-tottenham\">opening</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.adacollege.org.uk/\">Ada National College for Digital Skills</a>, to be based at Tottenham Hale within the area\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.haringey.gov.uk/news/agreement-reached-major-programme-transform-tottenham-hale\">redevelopment zone</a>. Ada\u2019s first sixth form intake will comprise up to 100 16-year-olds plus 50 apprentices aged 19 and above. Of these 150 students, 60% will live within a five-mile radius of the college and 40% within the borough of Haringey. There will be no fees and no qualifications required. Entry is by interview and aptitude with a logical problem-solving app.</p> <p>This is specialist further education, tailored not only to help fill the country\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/sep/25/training-deficit-uk-faces-digital-skills-gap\">digital skills gap</a> but also to advance what Ada chief executive and co-founder Mark Smith calls a social mission in a part of town containing many disadvantaged young people and rebuilding after the damage done by the 2011 riots. </p> <p>\u201cOur idea is to support low-income people into high tech jobs,\u201d he says, stressing that Ada students need not have done especially well at school in general to have the abilities the college will seek to nurture. There can be several reasons for that lack, including poor English language skills. Smith\u2019s reasoning is simple: \u201cThey might have struggled in some areas, but they could be great at maths and have a passion for digital knowledge. It\u2019s all about untapped potential\u201d.</p> <p>Smith is determined to encourage more girls and young women into the digital field. The college is named after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace\">Ada Lovelace</a>, the early 19<sup>th</sup> century mathematician (and daughter of Lord Byron), who wrote what some regard as the first computer programme. He says that up to 18% of the college\u2019s first intake will be female \u2013 a significant minority, given that the technology industry average for women has been put at just 13%.</p> <p>Ada has come about thanks to Smith pulling together a range of supporters to back his social enterprise. The project really got off the ground just before Christmas 2013 when the online gaming company <a href=\"http://www.gamesyscorporate.com/\">Gamesys</a> gave him \u00a3100,000, topped up with contributions of \u00a312,000 from each of its two founders. </p> <p>It helps that Smith has an education background: he assisted Andrew Adonis with writing his book <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/education-education-education\">Education, Education, Education</a> and both he and Ada co-founder Tom Fogden have been through the <a href=\"https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/about\">Teach First</a> programme, which aims to get talented teachers into classrooms in low income areas.

  "<p>Australian authorities may extend the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 beyond the current area, despite previously asserting the operation would be put on hiatus.</p> <p>The new head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, Greg Hood, said this week that officials were planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for MH370 in case the current area turns up nothing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/flight-mh370-modelling-shows-debris-may-be-further-north-say-scientists\">Flight MH370: modelling shows debris may be further north, say scientists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Experts are reportedly attempting to define a new search area, despite the absence of any funding commitment to enact it.</p> <p>This runs counter to the announcement made by Malaysia, Australia and China in July, that the effort <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/22/missing-flight-mh370-hunt-for-debris-will-not-be-extended\">would be indefinitely suspended</a> if the current search of a 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq miles) area of the southern Indian ocean, due to end in the coming months, did not reveal the whereabouts of the plane.</p> <p>Cost was said not to be a factor in the decision to put the effort on hiatus, but the current endeavour in a stretch of ocean south-west of Australia has cost AU$160m (US$122m).</p> <p>Associated Press reported on Friday that Hood \u2013 who took over from Martin Dolan as chief commissioner of the ATSB at the end of June \u2013 has said that a new search would require a new funding commitment.</p> <p>\u201cIf it is not in the area which we defined, it\u2019s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>The ATSB was conducting further analysis of the flaperon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/reunion-debris-flaperon-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-confirmed\">that was found on R\u00e9union Island</a> off the coast of Madagascar in July last year, 15 months after the plane went missing, in the hope of narrowing a new possible search area.</p> <p>The flaperon was the first piece of wreckage to be recovered from the lost Boeing 777, which disappeared with 239 people on board in March 2014.</p> <p>Hood said that six replicas of the flaperon would be sent to Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation\u2019s oceanography department in Tasmania, where scientists will try to determine what affects their drift.</p> <p>Examining the effects of currents and wind on their movement would enable more accurate drift modelling.</p> <p>If funding could be found, the next phase would see the ATSB set the replica flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around 8 March next year: the third anniversary of the disaster.</p> <p>Peter Foley, the ATSB\u2019s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, told AP that he hoped the enhanced drift modelling would narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550km (340 miles).</p> <p>\u201cEven the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to x-marks-the-spot.\u201d</p> <p>Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area were wrong to conclude that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours.</p> <p>The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200m (40,000 feet) after both engines lost power.<br></p> <p>But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was always in control of the plane argue that he could have glided it beyond the current search area.</p> <p>Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimise debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster.</p> <p>Foley told AP that analysis of a flap that washed up on Tanazia in June suggested it had not been deployed when it hit the water, but rather retracted inside the wing. A pilot attempting a soft landing would have extended the wing flaps.</p> <p>The ATSB is awaiting the verdict of a Boeing accident investigation team on their findings.</p> <p>Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 metres (12,000ft) and 6,100 metres (20,000ft) a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 metres (2,000ft) a minute would be typical of a controlled descent.</p> <p>\u201cThe rate of descent combined with the position of the flap if it\u2019s found that it is not deployed will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,\u201d Foley said.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we\u2019ve been looking.\u201d</p> <p>Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area. Less than 10,000 sq km (4,000 sq miles) of seabed remain to be scanned, though it may take until December to complete due to bad weather and 20m (65ft) swells.</p> <p>More than 20 sonar contacts off the Australian port of Fremantle, where the search ships are based, require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still hopeful and optimistic,\u201d Hood told AP.</p> <p>Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard MH370.</p> <p>\u201cWe will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The skeletons of two women who died more than 1,000 years and miles apart, but who shared conditions which would have filled their short lives with pain, go on display in <a href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/\">an exhibition opening in Glasgow</a>  this week.</p> <p>One was a tiny teenager who died in the early 19th century, and was given a pauper\u2019s funeral in a densely packed south London cemetery reserved for what the exhibition curator, Jelena Bekvalac, called \u201cthe abject poor\u201d \u2013 including many workers in the Southwark brothels.</p> <p>She was well under five feet tall, and by the end of her short life would have been in agony, her pitted skull revealing the scars of the open sores of tertiary syphilis, the then incurable disease with which she was probably born. Her bent leg bones may be another symptom of the disease, or caused by rickets, another condition usually related to poverty and poor diet.</p> <p> The other woman was Pictish, possibly with royal connections, given a high-status burial around the year 700 AD. She was laid under an imposing cairn on the beautiful Scottish island of South Uist in the Outer Hebrides \u2013 yet like the London girl, she suffered from shockingly worn and decayed teeth, and bone conditions related to dietary deficiencies.</p> <p>\u201cIt is impossible to look at these bones without feeling an emotional connection to these people who died so long ago,\u201d Bekvalac said.</p> <p>The decayed teeth of both women reveal how they lived and what they ate: the Pictish woman, who lived beside a sea teeming with life, ate almost no fish or seafood. The marks in the teeth of the London girl showed that in her short life she went through several periods of near starvation, until she died before her 20th birthday, and was buried in the <a href=\"http://www.crossbones.org.uk/#/history/4527977516\">Cross Bones cemetery</a> in Borough, south London. In the 16th century John Stow\u2019s Survey of London recorded it as a burial ground for \u201csingle women\u201d, a euphemism for prostitutes, and it was grossly overcrowded by the time it was closed in the mid 19th century as a danger to public health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c0674422dcb64821a6633e7cc49f7f0f87d5ff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c0674422dcb64821a6633e7cc49f7f0f87d5ff2/0_0_3500_2315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jelena Bekvalac, curator of human osteology at the Museum of London and Emily Sargent, curator at Wellcome Collection, check the skeleton of a female aged between 17-25 years old from Crossbones in Southwark who suffered the ravages of syphilis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jelena Bekvalac, curator of human osteology at the Museum of London and Emily Sargent, curator at Wellcome Collection, check the skeleton of a female aged between 17-25 years old from Crossbones in Southwark who suffered the ravages of syphilis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Callum Bennetts/MAVERICK PHOTO AGENCY</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The exhibition, which includes striking contemporary views of the sites by Thomas Adank, has been jointly created by the Museum of London, where Bekvalac is curator of human osteology in one of the <a href=\"http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/Centre-for-Human-Bioarchaeology/AboutUs/Default.htm\">largest collections of human remains</a>  taken from one location anywhere in the world, the Wellcome Collection, and the Hunterian medical museum in Glasgow, which has contributed remains from its own collection and from other Scottish museum collections.</p> <p>Emily Sargent, curator at Wellcome Collection, said: \u201cSpanning thousands of years and from opposite ends of the country and social scales, the bones of these individuals offer us a rare and special glimpse into history.

Recent research has revealed that the bones are not around 2,000 years old, like a nearby Iron Age settlement, but Neolithic, more than 5,000 years old. They revealed the earliest known case of rickets in the UK, leaving the woman with misshapen leg and chest bones.</p> <p>There are also the remains of an adolescent male from the Horse Cross cemetery in Perth, with a gaping skull fracture suggesting he may be a murder victim.</p> <p>\u2022 The exhibition is open, with free entry, at the <a href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/\">Hunterian Museum</a> until 8 January, and will then travel on to Bristol and Leeds next year.</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s newest gambling addiction charity has been accused of serious conflict of interest over funding from the betting industry and the involvement of gambling executives on its board.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.younggamblers.org.uk/\">Young Gamblers Education Trust</a>, which also operates under the trading name YGAM, was set up two years ago by reformed gambling addict Lee Willows as a private company and acquired charitable status earlier this year.</p> <p>Since its incorporation in August 2014, it has expanded and taken on a range of industry figures as trustees and ambassadors including its chair of trustees, Dan Waugh, a partner at Regulus Partners, a gambling consultancy, and Dan Rough, the founder of an online scratchcard firm.</p> <p>Campaigners have criticised the charity and raised concerns over the involvement of people from within the gambling industry.</p> <p> Simon Perfitt, who set up campaign group Rethink Gambling, said: \u201cThe presence of gambling executives and industry lobbyists within the charity is very concerning and in my view represents a serious conflict of interest.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/01/british-gamblers-record-losses-fixed-odds-betting\">British gamblers lost a record \u00a312.6bn last year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cGambling charities especially, should be independent and free from industry influence.\u201d <br></p> <p>YGAM defended itself from the claims saying it was a \u201cpredominantly volunteer-run\u201d organisation that worked closely with people affected by addiction.</p> <p>Willows said: \u201cYGAM has a diverse board of trustees from a range of sectors whom all bring different insights. We believe such a mix is important as it allows for more informed decision-making. As YGAM evolves, like any other charity, we keep our board composition under review.\u201d</p> <p>The charity, which distributes educational material for schoolchildren in an effort to prevent them from becoming addicted, receives significant donations directly from gambling firms such as Gala Group, Bet365, Paddy Power, Caesars Entertainment and the Senet Group. Details of the funding are found on its website but the backgrounds of its industry-linked trustees and ambassadors are not.</p> <p>YGAM is the latest gambling-addiction charity to have clear links to the industry, either through funding or trustees and staff. The model is prevalent throughout the gambling charity sector with many gambling charities funded by industry and heavily populated by current and former industry executives. The Charity Commission received a complaint about YGAM but found that it had not breached charity law.</p> <p>Perfitt said: \u201cOther gambling charities and support organisations struggle to obtain funding, so I would have to question why the gambling industry is pouring money into this particular charity. Could it be that they see it as a way of discharging their responsibility to contribute to gambling addiction prevention, safe in the knowledge that it will have a minimal effect on gambling harm and on their profits?\u201d</p> <p>Jim Orford, emeritus professor of clinical and community psychology at the University of Birmingham and founder of campaign group Gambling Watch UK, said the industry-engagement model used by YGAM fits with the \u201cbasic philosophy of the gambling establishment\u201d but warned that it could be difficult for charities taking industry cash to speak out on policy issues. <br></p> <p>Orford said it was likely that a charity receiving industry donations would \u201cavoid trying to antagonise the industry because they\u2019d be biting the hand that feeds them\u201d and that could give rise to a conflict of interest.</p> <p>The charity said it was intending to appoint ambassadors Anne and Keith Evans, whose gambling-addicted son killed himself, as trustees. It said that without industry support it would not be able to carry out work, which last year saw it train teachers and youth workers from more than 60 schools, colleges and charities and non-profits.</p> <p>Willows said: \u201cAs with many charities, the work of YGAM relies on income from a broad range of sources which include corporate donations, grants from charitable trusts and foundations, general fund raising, and self-financing. Our board have agreed a diverse income mix which is critical if we are to sustain the work of YGAM in to the longer term.\u201d</p> <p>YGAM was set up by Willows after he was given a suspended prison sentence for stealing \u00a320,000 from his employer, a young offenders charity called Trailblazers, to fund his own gambling habit.</p> <p>The charity provides training to teachers, youth workers, mental health staff and prison workers to deliver its own \u201cgambling-related harm-prevention programme\u201d. It also partners with universities to train year two and three psychology students to become YGAM peer mentors. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/31/big-gamble-dangerous-british-betting-shops\">The big gamble: the dangerous world of British betting shops | Tom Lamont</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along with Waugh and Rough, YGAM\u2019s trustees and ambassadors include Steve Donoughue, a prominent management consultant who specialises in the gambling industry and has worked as political adviser to the William Hill Group; and Andrew Poole, who started his career with counselling service GamCare and is now a compliance manager for Lotto24, and formerly SkyBet. </p> <p>Another trustee, Anna Small, does not have a background in the gambling industry.

  "<p>Business has changed. Thanks to the internet, it\u2019s faster and easier than ever to start something of your own. You no longer need to spend a fortune on staff, advertising and premises. You can get something going in 30 days on the side without quitting your job and market it online. Just follow these five steps to make it happen.<br></p> <h2>1. Find your killer idea</h2> <p>Want to know if a business idea you\u2019ve had is going to work? Then check you can answer \u201cyes\u201d to these three questions. Does this idea excite you? Do you bring something to this idea other than the idea itself (ie skills, knowledge or talents)? Is there demand for this kind of business? If you can\u2019t find any competition, it might be a sign that there isn\u2019t any demand.</p> <h2>2. Do the minimum version </h2> <p>You don\u2019t need a five-year plan. Do what startups do and create a minimum viable product \u2013 the smallest version of your business idea that you can put out into the world and prove people like it.</p> <p>What can you do in 30 days? Get your first client, even if it\u2019s for free. Create your first product. Run your first comedy night or whatever it might be. Did people like it? If so, do it again and make it bigger and better. If people didn\u2019t respond well, find out what was missing and rather than abandoning the whole thing see if there\u2019s a change you could make to fix it. </p> <p>Think 30 days is not enough? Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGsalg2f9js&amp;ab_channel=YCombinator\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote the first version of Facebook in 30 days</a> and my clients have started successful businesses, from dating profile photography to a historical blog to an international business network, in the same amount of time. They did it by starting small and then growing it.</p> <h2>3. Superniche</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to move into a crowded market with more experienced competitors. The solution is to \u201csuperniche\u201d \u2013 focus on a particular kind of person or organisation or create a product or service that\u2019s superb at one particular thing. Be willing to turn people away and you\u2019ll make yourself irresistible to the right kind of person.</p> <h2>4. Get your first customer</h2> <p>Skip the fancy logo and elaborate website. Put your focus on getting your first customer or client. If you can get one, you stand a good chance of being able to get 10 and if you can get 10 you stand a good chance of making the business work.</p> <p>If you need a website, create a one-page website on a system like Strikingly in an hour or two. Now is not the time to worry about how to get a million visitors to your website. Win your first client or customer from within your own network \u2013 reach out to your social and business circles and explain the value you or your product provides and get your first sales.</p> <h2>5. Do a back-of-an-envelope business plan</h2> <p>Forget writing a complex business plan. If you follow these guidelines to start without large expenditure you don\u2019t need one but it is worth doing a rough calculation. What\u2019s your target annual income? Given the price you\u2019re intending to charge and any costs you have, how many clients or sales would you need to hit that target?

The region\u2019s residents were about to receive a new visitor, a man who came with the promise of reviving their ailing economy and introducing them to a whole new way of life \u2013 Henry Ford.<br></p> <p>Local papers began raving about their future neighbour. Speculation ran wild: some columnists opined that Ford would be building a new railroad to the coast, or a new factory for his cars. Above all, they just wanted to know when he would be arriving.</p> <p>Officially, Ford\u2019s interest in Brazil was a business venture: the monopoly on Sri Lankan rubber maintained by Britain was driving up costs for his new Model A cars, so he wanted to find a cheap source of latex that would allow the Ford Motor Company to produce its own tyres, to cut costs. </p> <p>But Ford\u2019s vision ran much deeper. His goal was not simply to ship latex back to the company\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2016/04/12/ford-unveils-redevelopment-plan-dearborn-offices/82904392/\">Dearborn</a> HQ \u2013 it was to build his vision of the ideal city.

In his day, Ford\u2019s name was every bit as evocative of the glimmering promise of technological revolution as Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 perhaps even more so.</p> <p>Within a decade of its founding in Dearborn, Michigan in 1903, the Ford Motor Company had revolutionised car production by introducing the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dt13as.html\" draggable=\"true\">assembly line</a> \u2013 isolating tasks within the complex process of car assembly, allowing new models of his flagship vehicle, the Model T, to be cranked out faster than ever before, making the company a global success.</p> <p>Yet Ford\u2019s greatest innovation was arguably not mechanical, but social. He took pride in the fair treatment of his staff, and in 1914, to great fanfare, he proclaimed that all Ford workers would receive a daily salary of $5 (the equivalent of $120 (\u00a390) today).</p> <p>Ford believed fair treatment would make his workers more responsible citizens and, in the process, solidify a client base for manufacturers. The Rev Samuel Marquis, one the heads of Ford\u2019s employee relations office, once proclaimed that Ford\u2019s cars were \u201cthe by-products of his real business, which is the making of men\u201d.</p> <p>But some of Ford\u2019s social ideas were highly sinister \u2013 most <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/interview/henryford-antisemitism/\" draggable=\"true\">notoriously his anti-semitism</a>, which featured prominently in a newspaper he himself printed, the Dearborn Independent.</p> <p>He became increasingly convinced that his role in advancing society had to go beyond the factory floor, and encompass entire cities. While he succeeded in bringing some of his smaller urban planning concepts to life, his much larger project, a <a href=\"http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2013/01/post_89.html\" draggable=\"true\">massive manufacturing city to be built in northern Alabama</a> \u2013 75 miles long, with power supplied by damming the Tennessee river \u2013 never got off the ground.</p> <p>Eventually, Ford settled on a location for his ideal city that was a good deal further south than Alabama: the Amazon.</p> <h2>\u2018A work of civilisation\u2019</h2> <p>By the 1920s, the Amazon basin lay in shambles. At the end of the previous century, the region had benefited from a monopoly on global rubber production, skyrocketing demands, and easy transportation via the navigable waters of the Amazon river.</p> <p>Cities along the river had swelled with new residents seeking their fortunes, and had lined their streets with opulent new buildings. Belem, at the mouth of the river, became the busiest port in Brazil; upriver, Manaus became world famous for its decadent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/14/manaus-amazon-theatre-brazil-history-cities-50-buildings\">Amazon Theatre</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bdc4650fc33f60ee2f209d8ecbe7c7511658d780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdc4650fc33f60ee2f209d8ecbe7c7511658d780/51_182_844_415/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sawmill and Power House at Fordlandia\" width=\"500\" height=\"246\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sawmill and power house at Fordlandia were abandoned in 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The collections of Henry Ford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the cultivation of rubber trees could not be standardised; placing them too close together exposed them to blight and parasites. And though these trees only grew natively in Brazil, it wasn\u2019t long before enterprising botanists decided they would try planting them in other tropical regions, where they had no natural parasites. </p> <p>The British began growing rubber in Sri Lanka, after a rubber tree\u2019s seeds were famously <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/10903662/The-man-who-brought-rubber-to-the-Far-East.html\">smuggled out of Brazil</a>. And by the beginning of the century, this produce was vastly outperforming Brazil\u2019s rubber crop. The Amazon basin, heavily dependent on proceeds from rubber sales, was devastated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are not going to South America to make money, but to help develop that wonderful and fertile land</p> <footer> <cite>Henry Ford</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fresh off the failure of his Alabama development, Ford grew fascinated with the economically ravaged Amazon as a potential site for a reboot of his utopian aspirations. He had reportedly first become interested by the area after hearing ex-president Theodore Roosevelt, a personal friend, tell of his journey down the river. Increasing rubber prices gave a practical aspect to his dream.</p> <p>In his utopian mind, Ford\u2019s plan for growing rubber in the Amazon was (as one state department official later described it) a \u201cwork of civilisation\u201d. He believed the values that had made his company a success would build character anywhere else on the planet. In 1928, he went as far as to <a href=\"https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-resources/popular-topics/brazilian-rubber-plantations/\">announce</a>: \u201cWe are not going to South America to make money, but to help develop that wonderful and fertile land.\u201d</p> <p>But the move also represented a certain disenchantment with his home country, and a desire to start from scratch in the blank slate of the Amazon jungle. \u201cThe force of industrial capitalism [Ford] helped to unleash,\u201d writes Greg Grandin in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/30/fordlandia-forgotten-jungle-city-grandin\">definitive history of Fordlandia</a>, \u201cwas undermining the world he hoped to restore.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"830756fc143cd0642f1255cd127c956c656e832a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/830756fc143cd0642f1255cd127c956c656e832a/42_71_1115_669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fordlandia Dance Hall, Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To attract workers to Fordlandia, Ford offered a range of services \u2013 including an 18-hole golf course and dance hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The collections of Henry Ford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 1927, the economic justification for Ford\u2019s proposed incursion into Brazil had become less convincing. Britain\u2019s stranglehold on global rubber began to diminish, and his advisers suggested he would be better off purchasing rubber from local suppliers in Brazil. But Ford soon sent two of his most trusted men to reach an agreement with Brazilian authorities.</p> <p>The deal with the Brazilian state of Para was not exactly beneficial for Ford. He received rights to commercially operate a 5,625 sq mile tract of land on the Tapaj\u00f3s river, a tributary of the Amazon, for a total of $125,000. It was later revealed that Ford\u2019s men had given him something of a raw deal; by law, he could have obtained that land for next to nothing. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Ford now had all he needed to bring his ideals to life in the middle of the jungle. As Grandin notes: \u201cFord had the right to run Fordlandia as a separate state.\u201d</p> <h2>Ford\u2019s uphill battle</h2> <p>The site of Fordlandia had been chosen on top of a rise, to protect it from flooding. But this meant it was far enough inland that the cargo vessel chosen to haul construction materials could not pass through the rocky waters of the Tapaj\u00f3s until the rainy season. A crew assembled at the future site of the city in late 1928, angered by a rotting food supply, and revolted against its leadership.</p> <p>Materials didn\u2019t arrive at Fordlandia until early 1929. Construction finally began under the command of the Norwegian-born Einar Oxholm, who oversaw the laying out of Fordlandia\u2019s basic street grid. </p> <p>The city was built with a separate neighbourhood, the Vila Americana<em>,</em> for the American staff who worked there. Grandin points out that this development was separated from the areas intended for Brazilian workers. \u201cIt was offset a bit, similar to the relationship of suburbia to a city,\u201d he says. The Vila Americana had the best view of the city, and was the only section with running water; while the Brazilian workers made do with water supplied by wells.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa654a1b5c70363a01e191e8a151cb3b01956d69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa654a1b5c70363a01e191e8a151cb3b01956d69/0_0_5362_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of a derelict rubber factory, Fordlandia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"365\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interior of a derelict rubber factory in the middle of the city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The city would come to feature modern hospitals, schools, generators and a sawmill. By the end of 1930, its landmark structure was complete: a water tower, utilitarian beacon of modernity for Ford\u2019s \u201ccivilising\u201d project.</p> <p>But it still faced an uphill battle. Clearing the jungle was excruciating work, and despite Ford\u2019s famously high wages, labour of the kind needed for the project was in short supply. Amazon wood, which Ford had initially hoped to sell at a profit until rubber could be produced in the territory, proved useless.</p> <p>The local press, initially friendly, turned on Ford and his project. Meanwhile, Ford\u2019s desire that the city remain alcohol-free proved all but impossible to enforce. Oxholm didn\u2019t last long as manager \u2013 the city would go through several managers in its first two years.</p> <p>Just when things appeared to be settling down in Fordlandia, violence broke out again on <a href=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/the-ruins-of-fordlandia/\">20 December 1930</a>. At the workers\u2019 cafe, in which skilled workers were separated from manual labourers, an argument between supervisor Kaj Ostenfeld and Manuel Caetano, a brick mason working at the city, quickly escalated. Workers rallied behind Caetano, vandalising the city, destroying generators, manufacturing equipment, and even their own homes. </p> <p>Fordlandia\u2019s managerial staff managed to escape by ship; they were eventually able to subdue the violence, but only by appealing to Pan Am air magnate <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989780,00.html\">Juan Trippe</a> to assist them by flying in Brazilian military personnel on one of his planes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73f052cbb62da3add8ae5bc670b7cc32f23d4b0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73f052cbb62da3add8ae5bc670b7cc32f23d4b0f/0_28_3104_1864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Museum of Fordlandia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The drawing room in the museum that\u2019s housed in one of the former managers\u2019 homes in Vila Americana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After this low point, Fordlandia faced a turning point. Ford finally found a successful manager in <a href=\"https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/358392\">Archibald Johnston</a>, who turned the city around after the riot: paving the roads, finishing much of the city\u2019s much needed housing, and beginning work on access roads to connect Fordlandia with the massive territory Ford had acquired inland from the river.</p> <p>It was perhaps under Johnston that Fordlandia came closest to Ford\u2019s original ideal. He succeeded in bringing many of the amenities typical of American towns into the heart of the Amazon basin. The centrepiece was an entertainment facility that screened Hollywood films and also held dances. Health and education facilities were also improved. Johnson saw to it that many of Ford\u2019s behavioural edicts were put into place, including a strict diet (though the alcohol provision still remained hard to enforce), and an emphasis on gardening. </p> <p>But one problem remained: Fordlandia was not producing any rubber. Jungle foliage continued to be cleared, but efforts to plant rubber trees yielded discouraging results. The few trees that took root were quickly beset by blight.</p> <p>To combat this, Ford brought in expert botanist James R Weir, who infuriated Johnston by insisting on a number of extravagant planting methods, and then, in 1936, demanding the construction of a second plant within Ford\u2019s territory, called Belterra. Weir unceremoniously departed from Fordlandia a year later, without informing any staff of his intention to never return.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"18f6852dea6e024831a40ca8c77cf35e9934738e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18f6852dea6e024831a40ca8c77cf35e9934738e/56_195_840_504/500.jpg\" alt=\"Employee housing at Fordlandia\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">By 1940, the plant employed 400 people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The collections of Henry Ford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite having outlived their economic rationale, Fordlandia and Belterra<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>nonetheless persisted for nearly a decade. As Ford\u2019s car manufacturing operation became increasingly involved in the second world war effort, his holding in Brazil filled with American military personnel.</p> <p>By the time the war ended, Henry Ford was in poor health. Management of the company fell to his grandson Henry Ford II, who promptly cut into the company\u2019s ballooning costs by selling underperforming assets. Fordlandia was first on the chopping block.</p> <p>Ford II sold it back to Brazil for a fraction of what his grandfather had originally paid. The moment news of the sale reached Fordlandia, its American residents headed home, leaving its Brazilian residents wondering what had hit them.</p> <h2>A quiet death</h2> <p>In contrast to the excitement generated around its creation, Fordlandia\u2019s death was a quiet one. Equipment from the sawmill and generator was left to the elements and vandals over the years, rusting in the thick Amazon air. The iconic water tower still stands, though it no longer holds any water, and the Ford logo proudly painted on it has long since faded.</p> <p>In the past decade, however, Fordlandia has enjoyed something of a renaissance. Part of that is cultural: its history has been revisited in news articles, documentaries and even in music \u2013 Icelandic minimalist composer Johann Johannsson <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/jr54/\" draggable=\"true\">released an album in 2008 inspired by the city</a>. After the population languished at under 100 for several decades, it has rebounded to about 3,000 people in recent years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/17/lost-cities-8-mystery-ahokia-illinois-mississippians-native-americans-vanish\">Lost cities #8: mystery of Cahokia \u2013 why did North America's largest city vanish?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cToday, most residents don\u2019t care very much about Fordlandia\u2019s history,\u201d says Christiane von Schwind, producer of a <a href=\"http://www.gebrueder-beetz.de/en/productions/modern-ruins-fordlandia\">short documentary about the city</a>. \u201cIf the population is rising, I\u2019m sure it has to do with economic reasons rather than the history or \u2018spirit\u2019 of Fordlandia.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there are those who still remember their time in Fordlandia. In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2SpGRuwqA4\">2008 film about the city</a>, former resident Charles Townsend returns to the town with members of his family. Seeing one of the schools, he runs ahead of the camera, eager to chat with some of the children.</p> <p>\u201cWho here was born in Fordlandia?\u201d he asks the children in an easygoing Portuguese; they respond with cheers. \u201cI was born in Fordlandia too!\u201d he replies.</p> <p>Those children don\u2019t have the good fortune of attending a modern school, the way Fordlandia\u2019s first residents did.

  "<p>When I think of a marksman, I think of Clint Eastwood as the Man With No Name, but that, it seems, is all wrong. Tony Long, once a renowned firearms officer for the Metropolitan police, was the star of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/secrets-of-a-police-marksman?promo=coming_soon\">Secrets of a Police Marksman </a>(Channel 4). No hat, no poncho, no chewed cigar. It turns out that real protectors/killers have the bland look of a night manager from Tesco. Certainly Long appears to have found the guise of everyman a useful one in his 25 years as part of an elite group at Scotland Yard, for whom he shot five people, killing three.</p> <p>This record was open to interpretation. Long, mindful that some officers never fire an operational shot, considered himself unfortunate. On one occasion, he said: \u201cI was halfway through shooting and thought:\u2018Why is it me again?\u2019\u201d Admirers, however, dubbed him The Equalizer, borrowing (one might guess) from the 1980s TV series starring Edward Woodward as a gun-toting do-gooder.</p> <p>Long never came across as boastful, but the documentary made clear he was a crack-shot apart. It called him \u201cBritain\u2019s deadliest firearms officer\u201d.</p> <p>Opening his casebook, Long described his shooting in 1985 of a west-London man, Errol Walker, who had murdered a young woman and was threatening to kill her four-year-old daughter. Long is a man for detail. \u201cI fired a single shot at his head and as I did that his eyes seemed to flip open and roll up into his head.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c9421b67970e7ae67a41641645ee1c8552ad997\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c9421b67970e7ae67a41641645ee1c8552ad997/0_0_2641_1585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Long at a gun range in Prague\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Long at a gun range in Prague.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Production Company/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also described, with grainy footage, testimony and partial reconstruction, was Long\u2019s shooting in 1987 of two men engaged in an armed robbery in south-east London. He fatally shot two of them, hitting both twice. Long recalled his immediate reaction: \u201cI\u2019m thinking \u2018You have done it now, you have shot three people\u2019.\u201d Yet the nub of the programme, part of the Secret History series, was his most notorious case, the 2005 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/azelle-rodney\">cause cel\u00e9br\u00e8 shooting of drugs and firearms suspect Azelle Rodney</a> in north London. Though the Crown Prosecution Service declined at the time to prosecute, outraging Rodney\u2019s family, an official inquiry doubted Long\u2019s account. He was prosecuted at the Old Bailey seven years after his retirement.</p> <p>Long was acquitted, but left \u201ctarnished\u201d. Amid enduring concern over Rodney\u2019s death, and wider accusations of shoot-to kill-policing, this was a platform for a clearly aggrieved Long to restate his case.</p> <p>It raised important questions. How much armed policing do we need to meet the terrorist threat? Who will carry those guns on our behalf? Might they, because of unconscious bias, be more likely to shoot people of minority backgrounds? Do we accept that mistakes will be made in good faith?</p> <p>Are we comfortable with Long\u2019s summary of the necessary thought process? \u201cIf they pose an immediate threat to you, they cease to be a human being. They are a target. They have to be shot and you shoot them.\u201d</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher would have admired his directness, and she loomed large in last night\u2019s third instalment of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07n7grm\">The 80s with Dominic Sandbrook</a> (BBC2). It was another lively romp through a decade which gave us Big Bang, big hair, wide lapels, Del Trotter, mobile phones, acid house and the Iron Lady. She was all business, Sandbrook said, unleashing privatisations on British Telecom and British Gas to bring to an ailing nation the smack of firm management. She unleashed the poll tax, thus initiating the separation between the governing and governed that bedevils us today.</p> <p>This was social history for those of us of a certain age. We saw the first mobile phone, the first raves, the first Comic Relief, the first British branch of Ikea. But what we saw most was the incongruous, unexplained sight of the amiable Sandbrook in a cavernous deep blue parka coat. Was he chilly throughout? Or was it costume, identifying him as the time-travelling narrator? Worth noting that he didn\u2019t visit the scene of Thatcher\u2019s triumph, the Falklands.</p> <p>Still, he did reach the satisfying conclusion that Thatcher did not shape the nation as much as she wanted. She hoped privatisations would mould a nation of entrepreneurs; instead people cashed in their shares for profit. She wanted Victorian values; she got riots and ravers high on ecstasy. She was cussed but we were worse.</p>",

The final was potentially trickier but the tall Spaniard, ranked second in the world and a well-known counter-attacking threat, was picked off expertly in a spectacular final round.</p> <p>To be a double Olympic champion at such a young age may take time to sink in. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t seem real that I won it in London so to win it again is just crazy,\u201d admitted Jones. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how much pressure I\u2019d feel coming into these Games; I started crying before my semi-final because I felt so nervous but I pulled it off when it mattered.

The second round was a different story, however, leaving the contest delicately poised at 7-6 entering the final two minutes. The GB fans need not have worried, a flurry of chorus-line high kicks deciding the outcome in style.

Her gold medal in London caught her 19-year-old self slightly by surprise; for a while she found the attention difficult and subsequent motivation elusive. Now she is a much more experienced competitor and it shows; her only loss in the last 18 months came by a single point at the world championships last year after the electronic scoring system crashed during her quarter-final.</p> <p>What has not altered since London is her competitiveness under pressure and her coach Paul Green reckons she has dealt brilliantly with being the pre-Games favourite: \u201cShe is better tactically than she was four years ago. She understands the game better, she is a lot faster and stronger than her opponents and she always rises on the big days.\u201d</p> <p>Nerve and cobra-like watchfulness are also key prerequisites. In taekwondo the trick is to score via kicks to the trunk of the body or the head, allied to the occasional body punch, and be suitably evasive when required. Matches consist of three rounds of two minutes each and Jones loves to take the initiative early. There was certainly no hint of nerves in the early part of the day as she outclassed Morocco\u2019s Naima Bakkal 12-4 in her opening match before beating Belgium\u2019s ninth-seeded Raheleh Asemani 7-2 to reach the last four.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"062a616b0cfca830ce39d023c9263e25438ed43b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/062a616b0cfca830ce39d023c9263e25438ed43b/0_76_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Britain\u2019s Jade Jones celebrates victory over Eva Calvo Gomez with her coach Paul Green.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Britain\u2019s Jade Jones celebrates victory over Eva Calvo Gomez with her coach Paul Green.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These days, to facilitate better scoring, electronic sensors are embedded into the athlete\u2019s protective head and body armour in addition to special sensing socks. There could certainly be no disputing the two productive kicks, worth three points apiece, that earned a 7-1 lead over Asemani after the first round of her quarter-final alone. </p> <p>The world champion Mayu Hamada was less fortunate, bowing out unexpectedly in the quarter-finals, but Jones never wavered. Taekwondo fights are as much about speed, thought and execution as brute strength and self-control and fighting spirit are also a crucial part of the mix. Attempting to kick someone in the face requires a certain mindset and Rio\u2019s muggers would be well advised to give the sharp-footed Jones a wide berth. The bronzes went to Kimla Alizadeh Zenoorin, the first Iranian woman ever to secure an Olympic medal, and Egypt\u2019s Hedaya Wahba.</p> <p>Another fascinating day of martial art intrigue, meanwhile, awaits in the upcoming men\u2019s 80kg competition where Britain\u2019s Lutalo Muhammad finds himself in the same draw as his old foe Aaron Cook, who is now representing Moldova.</p>",

  "<p>After a whirlwind day in which Brazilian police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/ryan-lochte-us-swimmers-robbery-rio-gas-station\">presented strong evidence</a> contradicting American swimmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/ryan-lochte-rio-robbery-timeline\">Ryan Lochte\u2019s allegations</a> that he had been robbed at gunpoint, the US Olympic Committee apologized for the behavior of four of its athletes, including Lochte. </p> <p>The US Olympic Committee announced late on Thursday that Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger had provided statements to Brazilian police and their passports were returned. The pair had been pulled off a flight home the previous night as local authorities tried to unravel what actually happened early on Sunday morning when Lochte reported that he, Bentz, Conger and James Feigen were robbed at a gas station by men claiming to be police officers.</p> <p>A USOC statement released on Thursday appeared to agree with Rio police\u2019s assertions that Lochte\u2019s version of events are false.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/ryan-lochte-rio-robbery-timeline\">Ryan Lochte's Rio timeline: how the story of a late-night robbery got out of hand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs we understand it, the four athletes (Bentz, Conger, Feigen and Ryan Lochte) left France House early in the morning of August 14 in a taxi headed to the Olympic Village,\u201d the USOC statement said. \u201cThey stopped at a gas station to use the restroom, where one of the athletes committed an act of vandalism. An argument ensued between the athletes and two armed gas station security staff, who displayed their weapons, ordered the athletes from their vehicle and demanded the athletes provide a monetary payment. Once the security officials received money from the athletes, the athletes were allowed to leave.\u201d</p> <p>Police and the station\u2019s owner said the Americans damaged an advertising sign, and that two women were with the men but stayed in a taxi that was parked behind their cab.</p> <p>The USOC statement went on to apologize for the events of the last week. \u201cThe behavior of these athletes is not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA or the conduct of the vast majority of its members. We will further review the matter, and any potential consequences for the athletes, when we return to the United States.</p> <p>\u201cOn behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, we apologize to our hosts in Rio and the people of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil\">Brazil</a> for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellence.\u201d</p> <p>Police said earlier on Thursday that Bentz and Conger blamed Lochte for the original story saying he was drunk and agitated. Police added that neither Bentz or Conger had given a misleading statement after the Sunday incident, saying only Lochte and Feigen had done so. The USOC said Feigen has spoken to police and provided them with \u201ca revised statement.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/ryan-lochte-rio-olympics-robbery-gunpoint-ileana-reality-tv\">For clarity on the Ryan Lochte incident, just look to his reality TV show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>USA Swimming\u2019s executive director Chuck Weigus also released a statement on Thursday, attacking \u201clapses in judgment\u201d on the part of the swimmers. </p> <p>\u201cThe last five days have been difficult for our USA Swimming and United States Olympic families, While we are thankful our athletes are safe we do not condone the lapses in judgement and conduct that led us to this point,\u201d said Weigus in a statement. \u201cIt is not representative of what is expected as Olympians, as Americans, as swimmers and as individuals. This drawing attention away from Team USA\u201ds incredible accomplishments in the water and by other athletes across the Olympic Games is upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Lochte left the country three days ago and remains the only one of the four to say they were robbed. The USOC said Feigen hopes that by providing his statement to police he will be allowed to return home. Earlier on Thursday <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/brazilian-police-recommend-us-swimmers-ryan-lochte-james/story?id=41496292\">ABC reported </a>that police would seek to indict Lochte and Feigen over false reporting of a crime. The charges would not carry the threat of jail time under Brazilian law.</p> <p>Lochte is a six-time gold medal winner, with 12 overall medals over four Olympics making him one of the most-decorated swimmers in American history. He is also known for his colorful life away from the pool, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/ryan-lochte-rio-olympics-robbery-gunpoint-ileana-reality-tv\">had a reality show on the E!

When he\u2019s gone there will be no replacement, just a competing roster of normal scale humans beings. The Bolt persona above all will be missed; commercial catnip, but also an intriguing thing in itself. There is undoubtedly a real Bolt in there somewhere, some private part of himself that has remained discrete throughout the Bolt Supremacy, just as there is some clever misdirection in the party boy persona, the Swedish women\u2019s handball team schtick, the much-trumpeted chicken nuggets. The casual airs are an act of intimidation, a racing tactic. The playfulness with De Grasse in the semi-finals was a part of this, an invitation to blink first.</p> <p>Another odd thing: other sprinters like Bolt. No one resents him, or shows irritation at his theatrics. It isn\u2019t hard to see why. For a start Bolt makes them money. Tyson Gay has said his own revenues increased steadily as soon as Bolt started beating him, so profound was Bolt\u2019s effect on the entire sport. The wealth has been shared, if not the medals.</p> <p>Here he ran his last as an Olympic sprint finalist, although another world championships will follow. Some have even suggested that retirement will quickly pall, that his value is simply too great, his racing will too strong to depart even on a high. That remains to be seen. But in Rio this felt like the greatest of solo goodbyes for the greatest, and most fondly compelling of athletes.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f98fed244e592de791bffb30d3be5714490eacd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f98fed244e592de791bffb30d3be5714490eacd/36_393_4551_3063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bolt takes a bow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bolt takes a bow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:29:41.703Z\">at 4.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b67be0e4b062ce4d224c1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:25:00.960Z\">4.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Brazil wins the first set in the men\u2019s beach volleyball final.</strong></p> <p>Alison and Bruno take it 21-19 from the Italian pair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31ffb3a382a422d429bc38701e21467ca64f7bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31ffb3a382a422d429bc38701e21467ca64f7bac/0_0_3496_2447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil\u2019s Alison Cerutti celebrates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil\u2019s Alison Cerutti celebrates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:26:39.934Z\">at 4.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b67b51e4b0178756b5e0cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:24:05.196Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>China has WON the women\u2019s indoor volleyball semi-final, three sets to one against Netherlands. </strong>It was 25-23 in the fourth set.</p> <p>They\u2019ll play Serbia \u2013 who earlier knocked out the USA \u2013 in the final.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b67ae6e4b0c23bfed8adca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:21:48.277Z\">4.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Seriously, this is too close.

The official, who has direct knowledge of the investigation, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak about an ongoing probe.</p> <p>He said that around 6 am on Sunday, Lochte, along with fellow swimmers Jack Conger, Gunnar Bentz and Jimmy Feigen, stopped at a gas station in Barra da Tijuca, a suburb of Rio where many Olympic venues are located. One of the swimmers tried to open the door of an outside bathroom. It was locked. A few of the swimmers then pushed on the door and broke it. A security guard appeared and confronted them, the official said. The official says the guard was armed with a pistol, but he never took it out or pointed it at the swimmers. </p> <p>According to the official, the gas station manager then arrived. Using a customer to translate, the manager asked the swimmers to pay for the broken door. After a discussion, they did pay him an unknown amount of money and then left. The official says that swimmers Conger and Bentz, who were pulled off a plane going back to the United States late Wednesday, told police that the robbery story had been fabricated.</p> <p>A spokesman for Rio 2016 meanwhile, defended the swimmers whose accounts of an armed robbery, saying they were just kids who were having fun and made a mistake. </p> <p> \u201cThese kids tried to have fun, they tried to represent their country to the best of their abilities,\u201d Rio 2016 spokesman Mario Andrada told reporters said, without elaborating. \u201cThey competed under gigantic pressure.

I recall as a 13-year-old, (mildly enthusiastic about sports, but rubbish at anything other than rugby) the whole class doing the rounds of all the athletics events. My go at the long jump, and I\u2019m hurtling down my carefully-marked run-up when the teacher called out, in my final strides, \u201cYou look like a Sherman Tank, Williams!\u201d Completely put me off, but he wouldn\u2019t let me have another go, so my first and only recorded PB at the long jump was 8ft 6in\u2026.</p> <p> About a year later, playing volleyball in the gym (must have been raining), I managed, in the follow-through of an energetic smash attempt, to slap myself firmly in the danglers. Luckily no serious damage, just a fair bit of greenness about the gills and a lengthy time-out, during which the teacher (a different one) displayed his sympathy by remarking that at my age I ought to be completely familiar with my own tolerance for hard handling in that area\u2026.</p> <p> And later again, at rugby training, the teacher was demonstrating to the first-team pack some subtleties of track one and track two ball from the scrum, so installed himself as their hooker, and picked me to hook against him. This was a demo, so we non-first-teamers were really just there in place of the scrum machine that the school couldn\u2019t afford. Anyway, by chance, the first time the ball came in, I flicked my 1970s-budding-rock-bass-player long hair out of my eyes and caught the teacher full in the face (cheek-to-cheek, of course, in the scrum). I won the strike. Second time around, I did it on purpose and beat him again. Third time, the teacher got fed up \u2013 just before packing down, he did the old sniff and hawk and rolled a big green grolly out of the corner of his mouth into his beard, which he then rubbed up and down against my cheek as the scrum set. When I recoiled in disgust, he asked, \u2018Do we understand each other, Williams?\u2019. \u2018Perfectly, sir\u2026..\u2019 and the demonstration proceeded smoothly. The moral? Don\u2019t ever try to be clever with an old club player, even when he\u2019s a teacher\u2026.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b5be9fe4b0178756b5dd5d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T13:57:22.696Z\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Three game points to GB in the badminton... but the first is quickly saved with a dipping service return backed up with a smash. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b5be51e4b062ce4d2248ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/barneyronay\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T13:56:36.875Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cFurther to Sean\u2019s update on the Triathlon, I can confirm from my beachside seat that it is inhumanly hot on Copacabana.

Admittedly there has been a few bright sparks such as Dipa Karmarkar finishing fourth in the vault final being India\u2019s first ever gymnast to reach the final. Sadly even her story illustrates why India do so poorly at the Olympics as she was persistently underfunded as she relied on using the discarded gymnastic equipment from the 2010 Commonwealth Games to train with.

At 10am, it\u2019s the turn of the women high jumpers to try to qualify for the final of their event.</p> <p>Later in the morning, we\u2019ll have men\u2019s decathlon discus, two heats of round one of the men\u2019s and the women\u2019s 4x100m hurdles and the men\u2019s decathlon pole vault.<br>WIthout question, the most important event of the day is the men\u2019s 400m hurdles, which is scheduled for noon local time (4pm BST). Incredibly, Ireland have a representative in that who goes by the name of Thomas Barr, who qualified third fastest. He broke his Irish record to become the first Irishman in 84 years to qualify for an Olympic sprint event final and we wish him all the very best. <br>It\u2019s a nice sunny day here in Rio and I\u2019m impressed with what I\u2019m seeing here on my first visit to the track. Unfortunately, most of the seats are empty, but it\u2019s early doors and there are a lot of people milling around outside. Hopefully it will fill up in a bit. Spare a thought, too, for the ridiculously enthusiastic male and female warm-up act who have the unenviable job of trying to get the few hundred people who are already here fired up with enthusiasm. It can\u2019t be easy, first thing in the morning.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T12:30:53.200Z\">at 1.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b5a8fee4b0178756b5dcfa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T12:26:25.587Z\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Iurii Cheban, only reinstated into the competition last night, defends his title in the C1 200!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Valentin Demyanenko of Azerbaijan wins silver, and Isaquias Queiroz dos Santos of brazil, who already has a silver to his name, wins bronze. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a95afeafd1c82bc8d201d26adb5d4b0c2a2c594\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a95afeafd1c82bc8d201d26adb5d4b0c2a2c594/0_0_2455_1569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yuriy Cheban of Ukraine clings to his boat after jumping in the water when he won the men\u2019s canoe single.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yuriy Cheban of Ukraine clings to his boat after jumping in the water when he won the men\u2019s canoe single.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcos Brindicci/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T12:49:31.450Z\">at 1.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b5a8a6e4b062ce4d22483c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T12:24:25.000Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Russia\u2019s Andrey Kraitor, one of the favourites to win, has overcome an astounding amount of adversity to be here.

It was also uniquely well suited to the fat kids who were otherwise absolutely abject at swimming, given their ballast and sheer momentum would allow them to float further than their smaller, more svelte peers. [N.B. I wasn\u2019t one of those fat kids, and so never had the pleasure of competing in it, having thrashed myself in the more traditional events previously].<br></p> <p>I reckon they should make it an Olympic sport.\u201d<br></p> <p>The sadism they used to get away with in school was quite something. In mine, the teacher would open the fire doors in the winter, so the breeze came in off the Camden town coast. She also refused to let anyone get out of the pool using the steps or even the corner, so you\u2019d have everyone shivering on the side while two or three kids struggled.

  "<p>Greater transparency can equal greater democracy. Following the result of the EU referendum, many people want more of a say in politics, whether actively or passively. How can we widen the democratic voice and involve a larger part of the electorate, many of whom are young and will be the future of politics? </p> <p>The answer could lie in open data, and the increasing voter participation. Opening data means more people can understand their political system, both on a local and national level.</p> <p>On Barack Obama\u2019s first day he pledged (and has subsequently followed through on his promise) to make information about government operations readily available to US citizens. The UN too holds vast amount of data from its member states on healthcare, education, and development indices while the UN runs portals which hold vast amounts of data. To encourage people to engage with this information, it\u2019s crucial that governments and thinktanks find ways to energise the data.</p> <p>Apps are becoming more widely used to stimulate debate in politics. In the UK, Ed Dowding has created an app called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://represent.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Represent Me</a>. The online voting platform is intended to get younger people involved in political decision-making. \u201cIt\u2019s just asking people questions about the things they care about, and then making sure it goes where it can do most good. That way we engage on the frustrations people feel and can then go on to lead that to actions like supporting a group or working with others who agree with you \u2013 making being a citizen go way beyond the act of voting,\u201d explains Dowding.</p> <p>The app is designed to involve younger people more in the political debate \u2013 rather than poring through long surveys and trawling multiple websites, the app makes it easy to discuss and share feelings.</p> <p>Dowding believes using open data to widen the political discussion is an antidote to the staid political system we currently have. He argues that open data and modern technology can aid democracy. \u201cCan we create new ways to engage more people, build more consensus, and deliver more positive action with less bureaucracy? We\u2019re not suggesting a revolution \u2013 we\u2019re working in parallel with government to help the existing structures work more effectively.\u201d For example, if the public use the app to share their views on fracking, or new housing, local authorities can use the app to save on consultation fees and more efficiently allocate resource. If businesses use the app, then by knowing what is important to local people (who can be organised by postcode or ward), they can better serve civic values.</p> <p>In the UK, open data is used mainly for fact-checking and other inputs into the political debate. However, Tim Davies, co-founder of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.opendataservices.coop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Data Services co-operative</a>, believes open data can play a role in opening up participatory and democratic discourse in new spaces. For example, in the 2016 Open Government Partnership national action plan the UK committed to open up more data on public contracting using the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.open-contracting.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">open contracting data standard</a>. He explains: \u201cThe terms of contracts control billions of pounds of public sector investment \u2013 and as more and more services are contracted out, oversight is taking place through contract management, rather than through the internal structures of local government and public services. That means to maintain democratic control, we need to open up the contracting process more \u2013 having access to information on what is planned, decision-making over tenders, and performance information as contracts are delivered.\u201d</p> <p>Apps that make use of open data are being used to support democracy around the world. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ushahidi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ushahidi</a>, an app that allows users to upload real-time data, helped Kenyans to protect their elections in 2013, and has since been harnessed elsewhere. The user can report any incidence of election tampering through Ushahidi and these are shown on the app.</p> <p>However, Stephen Abbott, portfolio manager at <a href=\"http://index.okfn.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Knowledge International</a> explains how, in Africa, the biggest struggle is securing the data in the first place. One of the sustainable development goals is to create better access to data across Africa. </p> <p>Abbott says open data is already helping improve the election process in some countries. \u201cIn Burkina Faso for example, they publicly opened up their election data to try to avoid past violence that centred around elections by allowing civil society groups to check on the way the elections are being run.\u201d</p> <p>When an uprising <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/world/africa/burkina-faso-protests-blaise-compaore.html?_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">forced Blaise Compaore</a> from his 27-year presidency, the interim government decided to use open data to improve democracy in the country. Together with the World Bank and the Open Data Institute, live results were published and accessible for the first time during the <a href=\"http://www.burkina2015.bf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">last elections</a>. A team of civil servants used open data to make the election more transparent, and the winner, Christian Kabore, was deemed to be elected as a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201512021304.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">result of a democratic</a> process.</p> <p>More open information can help involve the electorate. Simpler applications of open data, say, for example, easy-to-read graphs or maps (for example, of this <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/road-safety/8989366/Graphic-Londons-cycle-accident-black-spots-mapped.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">useful map</a> of London\u2019s bike accident blackspots), can help to widen people\u2019s understanding of key issues.</p> <p>Dowding suggests: \u201cInvolve people in the decisions at the start, deliberately seek consensus, and treat people like responsible adults and we build the trust and unity of purpose which means we can do huge things, quickly. And we need to. We can bury our heads in the sand, but that just makes it even easier for reality to kick us in the arse.\u201d</p> <p>Open data can help to encourage that responsibility by easing access to information, especially on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/aug/18/open-data-save-lives-emergency-services-disaster-relief\">local level</a>. Local governments understand how valuable <a href=\"http://www.democraticaudit.com/?p=15565\" rel=\"nofollow\">releasing local data</a> can be \u2013 whether we\u2019re learning how well our hospitals are doing, or how crime rates are reducing, all of these elements contribute to greater understanding of how our society works. In turn, we\u2019re then able to make more informed decisions in elections. Open data is improving our knowledge, and with it, our democracy.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>Labor has accused the treasurer, Scott Morrison, of preparing to back down on a key election promise after reports he may water down changes designed to make superannuation less generous as a tax minimisation strategy.</p> <p>On Friday, <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/govt-considers-more-super-concessions-to-appease-mps-20160817-gqv6yi\">the Australian Financial Review reported Morrison was considering </a>increasing the $500,000 cap on non-concessional super contributions proposed in the May budget to $750,000 or changing the commencement date of the cap.</p> <p>When asked to rule out the changes, a spokeswoman for the treasurer said the government was consulting on the \u201cimplementation\u201d of the super reforms taken to the election.</p> <p>\u201cThe government will consider technical changes to assist in the implementation of these necessary reforms,\u201d she said.</p> <p>On Thursday, Morrison addressed exemptions to the cap in an interview with Sky News. He said he had flagged an exemption for settlement of property sales before the election, and other exemptions for life events including divorce settlements were still \u201cbeing worked through\u201d.</p> <p>Morrison said there was \u201cspeculation\u201d that lottery wins and inheritances would also be exempt, but said they were \u201cnot things being contemplated by the government nor have they been\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier in August, Morrison indicated that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/scott-morrison-reveals-changes-to-coalitions-superannuation-reforms\">insurance payouts as a result of accidents would also be exempt from the cap</a>.</p> <p>The impact on the budget of the life events exemptions, raising the cap or changing its commencement date were still unclear.</p> <p>The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, seized on the report, saying it was \u201chumiliating\u201d for the treasurer to make the changes in an effort to calm the Liberal backbench.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to read about Scott Morrison\u2019s climbdown and back-flip on the back page of the Financial Review, leaked out by the government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201c[Morrison] should be on the front foot and tell people, the superannuants of Australia, those who have invested in good faith under existing rules, just what his policy is.\u201d</p> <p>Bowen said it appeared superannuation legislation would not be ready for some time \u201cbecause the government is at war with itself\u201d over the issue.</p> <p>Since the election, the superannuation policy has come under fire from conservatives within the Coalition, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/20/george-christensen-threatens-to-vote-against-coalitions-superannuation-changes\">threats from MP George Christensen to cross the floor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/14/eric-abetz-warns-malcolm-turnbull-against-superannuation-changes\">warnings from senator Eric Abetz that the policy cost it support from its base</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/12/labor-wants-inquiry-on-retrospective-super-changes-before-giving-support\">Labor wants the proposed superannuation changes to be reviewed</a>, particularly to determine whether they are retrospective because the lifetime cap on non-concessional contributions is back-dated to 2007.</p> <p>Asked about the possible u-turn on 3AW radio in Melbourne on Friday, Malcolm Turnbull said \u201cthe treasurer is consulting with colleagues\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur policy is the one we took to the election, the one that was set out in the budget, but he is ... carefully consulting with our colleagues, and of course other interested parties and stakeholders,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In July, Ian Yates, chief executive of the Council on the Ageing, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/18/superannuation-changes-coalition-urged-not-to-water-them-down\">the Coalition has an obligation to voters who had returned it to government</a> to deliver the changes which would make the super system more fair.</p> <p>On Friday, senator John Williams told Guardian Australia he had received \u201cvery negative feedback from constituents\u201d that the backdated life-time cap had \u201cchanged the goalposts half way through the game\u201d. </p> <p>Williams said when the Senate inquiry into financial advice restarts he would investigate complaints he had received about life insurance products offered through superannuation.<br></p> <p>He cited the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/08/asic-examines-claims-comminsure-avoiding-payouts-to-sick-and-dying\">revelations of CommInsure\u2019s failure to payout on claims</a>, and the example of a man who had committed suicide and did not receive a life insurance payout, despite paying premiums, because his super balance was below a required threshold.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Mastermind </strong><br>7.30pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>The question setters for tonight\u2019s episode have the opportunity to uncork pub quiz classic: the middle name of Harry S Truman. The contestant specialising in the life of the 33rd president of the United States will probably have seen that one coming, however. Other specialist subjects tested are the World Cup, the works of REM, and the Scandinavian political drama Borgen, which John Humphrys should handicap by asking the questions in Danish. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Amazing Spaces Shed of the Year </strong><br>8pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>What a pure delight this show has been \u2013 everyone involved should be applauded for shining a frankly much-needed beacon of undiluted loveliness on to 2016. However, before tonight\u2019s grand finale, there are two categories left to play for: budget sheds, and cabins and summerhouses, including a shed on wheels, a painstaking recreation of a 1940s Canadian lodge, and a beach hut built for just \u00a320 by a hilariously excitable Will Hardie fan. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>Highlands: Scotland\u2019s Wild Heart </strong><br>9pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>Very much a standard modern BBC nature series, in that it\u2019s visually stunning but suffers from a slightly overwrought script. As autumn arrives and preparations begin for the privations of winter, there\u2019s plenty at which to marvel. Reindeers rut. Squirrels hide nuts (and decoy nuts to fool other squirrels). And, most memorably, grey seals make sweet love before collapsing into blissful post-coital embraces among the crashing Orkney waves. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Summer of Love <br>9pm, PBS America<br></h2> <p>PBS paints a more nuanced picture of the Summer Of Love than history books provide, transporting us to 1967 San Francisco through archive footage and interviews with former hippies. Expect subversion, rock\u2019n\u2019roll and lots of LSD. The flaws of the hippie movement aren\u2019t overlooked \u2013 we learn how popularity quashed its true spirit, and about the drug culture behind all those cosmic experiences. <em>Micha Frazer-Carroll</em></p> <h2><strong>Friday Night Dinner </strong></h2> <h2><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a2fc6fd143706003cfaf2f1d6f5da9dd11bf724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a2fc6fd143706003cfaf2f1d6f5da9dd11bf724/0_159_2833_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cast chemistry \u2026 Friday Night Dinner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cast chemistry \u2026 Friday Night Dinner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Johnson/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the exception of the Siddiquis from Gogglebox, the Goodmans are arguably the funniest family on British telly right now.

Also guesting on the series closer are Russell Kane, Al Porter and Carol Vorderman. There\u2019s cheeky banter \u2013 personified by Kelly Brook as one team captain \u2013 but the show is made somewhat edgier by her rival, the naturally hilarious Vicky Pattison. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Monty Python: Live at Aspen <br>11.40pm, Gold<br></h2> <p>Filmed in 1998, this sees the surviving Pythons already well advanced on the reminiscence trail that has lasted a good deal longer than their heyday as a group.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s endangered water voles will reach new heights when they are returned to Yorkshire\u2019s Malham tarn for the first time in 50 years.</p> <p>Around 100 water voles will be reintroduced on Friday to the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/malham-tarn-estate\">National Trust estate</a> in the Yorkshire dales, home to England\u2019s highest freshwater lake, in what the trust says is the highest-altitude reintroduction of the species it has carried out in Britain.</p> <p>Immortalised as Ratty in Kenneth Grahame\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/09/100-best-novels-the-wind-in-the-willows-kenneth-grahame\">The Wind in the Willows</a>, the water vole is <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/water-vole\">Britain\u2019s fastest-declining mammal</a>. The animal was once found in nearly every waterway in England, Scotland and Wales, but is now thought to have been lost in up to 90% of these sites, clinging on in isolated pockets, coastal marshes and backwaters.</p> <p>The intensification of agriculture, pollution and development, plus poor riverside management, has brought about the loss and degradation of the riverbank habitat in which the voles live. But the sharpest declines in the past 30 years have been caused by the spread of the <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/american-mink\">American mink</a>. These animals have established themselves on the waterways after escaping from fur farms, and they prey voraciously on the water vole. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb63e7a5b9e687b73e5272e31aaee1c3be2be2e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb63e7a5b9e687b73e5272e31aaee1c3be2be2e5/0_0_4320_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Water voles being transported to Malham tarn ahead of their release.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The water voles being transported to Malham tarn ahead of their release.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Rayner/North News &amp; Pictures Ltd for National Trust</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reintroduction schemes, alongside programmes to control mink and manage habitats, are providing a lifeline for the species.

A glacial lake set among ancient limestone pastures and upland hill farms, it is home to rare plants and animals including stonewort, sheltering pea mussels and the three-spined stickleback. The tarn also provides food for diving birds such as great crested grebes.<br></p> <p>At 377 metres above sea level, it is England\u2019s highest freshwater lake, and this is the highest-altitude release undertaken by the National Trust. Previous upland releases have taken place at Duchray in the Scottish Highlands (up to 300m) and Brecon Beacons in Wales (154m).</p> <p>It is hoped the animals will recolonise the tarn and its surrounding streams, and play an important part in the ecosystem, grazing and burrowing into areas of the riverbank and allowing rare plants to grow, including mosses and liverworts that need patches of open habitat. The water voles will also act as a food source for predators such as barn owls and otters.<br></p> <p>Roisin Black, a National Trust ranger at Malham tarn, said: \u201cIn the rest of Europe, water voles are common. In Britain, the creatures are incredibly rare. We know water voles have thrived at Malham tarn in the past and, thanks to work by the National Trust, the habitat here is perfect for water voles again.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/11/englands-water-voles-in-desperate-decline\">England's water voles in desperate decline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The animals will spend two days in large cages on the fringes of their new home.

  "<p>The original appearance of a ship from the Battle of Jutland has been recreated, superimposed on the wreck that still lies on the seabed off the Yorkshire coast where the ship finally sank after being hit by German torpedoes for a third time.</p> <p>The warship HMS Falmouth is the only substantial wreck of a Royal Navy ship from the battle still lying in English waters. The ship has been recreated digitally by Historic England as a 3D image strikingly superimposed above its present state, based on recent survey work of the wreck, which lies in shallow water in Bridlington Bay.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people think of the first world war, they think of the Somme and the trenches,\u201d said Wayne Cocroft, a historian at Historic England. \u201cThey forget that you could stand on many British beaches, look out to sea, and see the war happening before your eyes. We hope that by recreating this almost forgotten ship, we will remind people of this very important but now largely invisible aspect of the war.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Falmouth was among 250 ships, with more than 100,000 crew from the British and German navies, that fought in the only major sea battle of the war, off the Danish coast on 31 May 1916. More than 6,000 British and 2,500 German sailors died in the battle, which was fought in such foggy conditions that although the consensus was that the British won, the outcome was unclear even to the combatants and is debated among naval historians to this day.</p> <p>Falmouth fought as part of Admiral Beattie\u2019s battle cruiser fleet, and torpedoed the German cruiser Lutzow, sustaining only minor damage to its superstructure.</p> <p>On 19 August it was sailing south with the fleet when it was hit by two torpedoes fired by a German submarine. Twelve of the crew were killed, but most were rescued, and the damaged ship continued with a skeleton crew. The following day it was torpedoed again.</p> <p>\u201cThat was really it for the ship, though most of the crew were saved as it listed over and sank quite slowly,\u201d said Cocroft. \u201cDivers were sent down immediately and retrieved some of the guns, and there was more salvage work \u2013 really scrap metal strippers \u2013 in the 1930s, but most of the wreck remains intact where it sank.\u201d</p> <p>The seabed survey of the wreck was carried out with the Coastguard Agency, and the 3D model made using a three-metre model of the ship that is now part of the Imperial War Museum collection and on display at the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thedockyard.co.uk/\">Chatham Historic Dockyard museum</a>.</p> <p>The only intact veteran of the battle, <a href=\"http://www.nmrn.org.uk/exhibitions-projects/hms-caroline\">HMS Caroline</a>, has been restored in Belfast docks, where it was opened as an outstation of the Museum of the Royal Navy to mark the battle\u2019s anniversary.</p> <p>A leaflet on the history of HMS Falmouth can be <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.historicengland.org.uk/\">downloaded from the Historic England website</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A more humble ship from the war, a trawler refitted as a minesweeper, whose wreck was rediscovered two years ago off the Dorset coast, has been given official protection by the government to guard it from illegal salvage divers.</p> <p>The steam trawler Arfon was built at Goole in east Yorkshire in 1908, and worked out of Portland harbour during the war, sweeping mines laid by German U-boats out of the shipping lanes. In April 1917 the inevitable happened: it struck a mine and sank fast, with the loss of 10 of the crew of 13.</p> <p>It was rediscovered off St Alban\u2019s Head with its minesweeping gear, deck gun, port holes and engine room still intact.</p> <p>Joe Flatman, head of listing at Historic England, said: \u201cThe Arfon shipwreck is a rare survivor of a type of vessel once very common around the coastline of Britain but which has now entirely disappeared, surviving only in documents and as wrecks like this one.\u201d</p> <p>The crews of these vessels faced great dangers, he said. \u201cTrawlers, minesweepers and other coastal patrol vessels played a crucial role in keeping the sea lanes around the British Isles open during both world wars, a part of the war effort that is often overlooked.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s manufacturers were only just recovering from the last downturn when the Brexit vote dealt a fresh blow to confidence, and the early signs are that the mere prospect of leaving the EU has hit demand for goods rolling off British production lines.</p> <p>Brave timing then for anyone to open a new factory, but that is just what a small British bike manufacturer has done.

Korir has passed the last few months training on the high plateau \u2013 about 7,000ft up \u2013 around Eldoret with teammate <a href=\"https://www.iaaf.org/news/report/london-marathon-kipchoge\">Kipchoge</a>, who is the favourite to win Sunday\u2019s race in Rio. </p> <p>Korir has been a vocal critic of doping in distance running. International athletics officials have said that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/17/iaaf-kenya-investigation-doping-allegations?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Gmail\">use of performance enhancing drugs is widespread </a>among Kenyan sportspeople.

That will be a bonus. We are there to clear the name of Kenyan athletes. Spectators need to be able to watch a Kenyan run and be sure he is clean,\u201d Korir said.</p> <p>Observers have suggested many reasons for the problems with doping in Kenya: corruption, the incentive of six-figure earnings in a poor country and poor regulation. But Korir said the problem is larger.</p> <p>\u201cFighting doping does not mean just passing a law. It is more than testing. We need to go back and see where we went wrong,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One problem was the focus of race directors and sponsors on ever-faster times, Kiror said. This tempts those with less talent into shortcuts to fame and fortune. He suggests spectators too need to think differently.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not the times the athletes have run that are important. [Spectators] have to understand what a win means to him, to his family, to his country,\u201d Kiror said. </p> <p>\u201cTo those watching, [a runner] should not be a machine but a person whose success could change \u2026 the lives of hundreds or thousands of people \u2026 There are lots of theories about why Kenyan runners are so good. The answer is simple: they are running to change lives.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s a perplexing question: why has so little changed since 2008? If your recall is a little hazy, 2008 was the year the world woke up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">a banking crisis of epic proportions</a>, a crisis borne of blind faith in market wisdom and an utter lack of public oversight. But in a bizarre twist, the parties who benefited from the bust were the conservatives (the people who glibly told voters it was all the government\u2019s fault) and the xenophobes (who blamed it all on terrorists and immigrants, who steal our jobs yet are too lazy to work).</p> <p>So why isn\u2019t the left coming up with some real alternatives? There are volumes to be written about this conundrum, but I\u2019d like to venture one simple explanation: the eternal return of underdog socialism.</p> <p>It\u2019s an international phenomenon, observable among legions of leftwing thinkers and movements, from trade unions to political parties, from columnists to professors. The world view of the underdog socialist is encapsulated in the notion that the establishment has mastered the game of reason, judgment and statistics, leaving the left with emotion. Its heart is in the right place. The underdog socialist always has his or her back against the wall. Warily they watch the neoliberals, the multinationals and the Eurocrats advance, but can\u2019t bring themselves to do much more than whimper: \u201cCome on guys, do we have to?\u201d</p> <p>An MP from the Flemish Green party recently asked me: \u201cYes, but isn\u2019t the government deficit too high?\u201d She stared in disbelief when I answered that the deficit was actually too low. Jeremy Corbyn still hasn\u2019t offered any convincing vision that resonates beyond his most devoted fans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seems as if leftists like losing \u2013 as if all the doom and atrocities mainly serve to prove them right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the Socialist party in France and Germany\u2019s Social Democratic party are moving farther towards the middle of the road. In my own country, the Netherlands, the vacuous governing social democrat party seems to believe it will be able to inch its way up the polls if only economy shows some limited growth. \u201cThe left has failed to come up with ideas that are economically sound and politically popular beyond ameliorative policies such as income transfers,\u201d the economist <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/anti-globalization-backlash-from-right-by-dani-rodrik-2016-07\">Dani Rodrik recently wrote</a>.</p> <p>The underdog socialist has a surfeit of compassion and finds prevailing policies deeply unfair \u2013 seeing the achievements of the 20th century crumbling to dust, and rushing in to salvage what he can. But when push comes to shove, the underdog socialist caves in to the arguments of the opposition, always accepting the premise upon which the debate takes place. \u201cNational debt is out of control, but we can make more programmes income-dependent ... Fighting poverty is terribly expensive, but it\u2019s part of being a civilised nation ... Taxes are high \u2013 but each according to his ability.\u201d</p> <p>Reining in and restraining, that\u2019s the sole remaining mission of the underdog socialists. Anti-austerity, anti-privatisation, anti-establishment: one is left to wonder, what are underdog socialists actually for? Time and again, they side with society\u2019s unfortunates: poor people, dropouts, asylum seekers, disabled people and the discriminated. They decry Islamophobia, homophobia and racism. Meanwhile, they obsess over the proliferation of \u201crifts\u201d dividing the world into blue-collar and white-collar, poverty and wealth, ordinary people and the 1%, and vainly seek to \u201creconnect\u201d with a constituency that has long since packed its bags.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dca8e822b3abfb69d67bc361a670a1255cbf94ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dca8e822b3abfb69d67bc361a670a1255cbf94ab/0_17_1390_1900/732.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Nathalie Lees\" width=\"732\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But the underdog socialists\u2019 biggest problem isn\u2019t that they are wrong. They are not. Their biggest problem is that they\u2019re dull. Dull as a doorknob. They\u2019ve got no story to tell; nor even the language to convey it in. Having arrived at the conclusion that politics is a mere matter of identity, they have chosen an arena in which they will lose every time.</p> <p>And too often, it seems as if leftists actually like losing. As if all the failure, doom and atrocities mainly serve to prove they were right all along. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of activism,\u201d Rebecca Solnit remarks in her book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jul/02/highereducation.globalisation\">Hope in the Dark</a>, \u201cthat\u2019s more about bolstering identity than achieving results.\u201d</p> <p>One thing Donald Trump understands very well is that most people prefer to be on the winning side (\u201cWe\u2019re going to win so much. You\u2019re going to get tired of winning.\u201d) They resent the pity and paternalism of the good Samaritan. The always-impending apocalypse \u2013 whether the next financial crash or unavoidable climate disaster \u2013 is not a great motivator.</p> <p>What the underdog socialist has forgotten is that the story of the left ought to be a narrative of hope and progress. By that I don\u2019t mean a narrative that only excites a few hipsters who get their kicks philosophising about \u201cpostcapitalism\u201d after reading some deadly dull tome. The greatest sin of the academic left is that it has become fundamentally aristocratic, writing in bizarre jargon that makes cliches seem abstruse. If you can\u2019t explain your ideal to a fairly intelligent 12-year-old, it\u2019s probably your own fault. What we need is a narrative that speaks to millions of ordinary people. It all starts with reclaiming the language of progress.</p> <p>Reforms? Hell, yes. Let\u2019s give the financial sector a real overhaul: hike those buffers, carve up those banks, and give those tax paradises a run for their money. And after that, let\u2019s reinvent the welfare state and <a href=\"https://decorrespondent.nl/10/waarom-we-iedereen-gratis-geld-moeten-geven/384450-0b1c02bd\">eradicate poverty</a> for good \u2013 now that\u2019s an investment <a href=\"https://medium.com/utopia-for-realists/why-do-the-poor-make-such-poor-decisions-f05d84c44f1a#.a20lg7kfw\">that will pay for itself</a>.</p> <p>Meritocracy? Bring it on. Let\u2019s finally pay people according to their real contributions.

Some claim to be fully booked for months. Here, surrogacy packages start at $33,000 (\u00a325,400), compared with $90,000-$150,000 in the US.</p> <p>On agency websites, \u201ctravelling surrogates\u201d like Kew are advertised. But, like her, these women may lack clear information about the job they have signed up for. </p> <p>\u201cWe have to be aware that surrogacy is a foreign concept in Cambodia. No laws are in place to regulate the process, leaving both parents and surrogates unprotected,\u201d warns Everingham.</p> <p>For Preeti Bista, owner of the Nepalese surrogacy agency My Fertility Angel, the unclear rules and low costs are precisely what make Cambodia an attractive place to set up what she says will be an ethical surrogacy business. \u201cSince surrogacy has been put on hold in Nepal, I have both desperate surrogates and parents calling me non-stop, asking me if I can help them.

In addition to the main fee of 250,000 baht, each month there was a payment of 15,000 baht, which the agency encouraged her to spend on healthy groceries. </p> <p> Besides the required hospital visits, Por doesn\u2019t recall any other instructions from her agency. She did not receive any counselling on the potential emotional toll of surrogacy, or any explanation on the legal (guardianship) papers she had to sign.</p> <p>\u201cOccasionally, my contact person would give me a call to check how I was feeling, but that was all.\u201d In the meantime, she was working in the fields and taking care of her own two boys. \u201cI will do it a second time, even if I have to travel to another country for it,\u201d she says, adding that she does it for the money, but also because the baby\u2019s Australian parents told her she had given them a precious gift.</p> <p> But how long Cambodia can be Asia\u2019s new surrogate haven remains to be seen. \u201cOnly one scandal has to surface and the whole thing will fall apart,\u201d says Bista.

Because most forced labour and human trafficking networks operate on a cross-jurisdictional basis, tackling this global challenge also requires action by businesses operating internationally.</p> <p> The act seeks to address this, not by threatening legal penalties on companies but rather by generating pressure from civil society, consumers and investors to initiate a substantial change in corporate behaviour.</p> <p> All organisations with a turnover of more than \u00a336m doing business in the UK are required to publish an annual statement setting out the steps they have taken to prevent slavery in their businesses and supply chains in the UK and overseas. But the government has left businesses free to decide for themselves what, if any, such steps to take and subject only to the judgement of the court of public opinion if they fail to take action. </p> <p> The success of this light touch approach will depend on companies that fail to take meaningful steps being named and shamed, and seen to suffer tangible reputational damage that causes customers and investors to turn away. Only the genuine threat of a severe hit to their bottom lines is likely to force less responsible businesses to take the necessary action. </p> <p> Whether the act makes a big difference will also depend on companies looking beyond their businesses and supply chains in the UK to their operations and suppliers overseas. </p> <p>Leading companies have developed broad frameworks to conduct deep due diligence focusing not only on their direct suppliers but examining all parts of their supply chain, right down to who picks the cotton, who sews the shirt and who mines the ore. Just as companies are already required to take all reasonable steps to know whether there is money laundering in their supply chain, they should do the same for slavery. </p> <p> The government must keep the actions of companies under close review and be ready to dictate more specifically what they must do and to impose tougher legal penalties if companies fail to act.</p> <p> The media and NGOs have a crucial role to play in highlighting serious shortcomings. A valuable starting point is the Transparency in the Supply Chain data bank to which businesses are encouraged voluntarily to submit their reports. This enables companies confidentially to admit when they find that their suppliers are using enslaved workers, facilitates comparisons of what companies are doing and will help to identify and reward best practice. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/14/modern-slavery-act-explained-business-responsibility-supply-chain\">The UK's new slavery laws explained: what do they mean for business?</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But the early signs are not promising: to date only about 100 of the 12,000 companies required to produce a statement under the act have submitted it to the data bank.

There is no one-size-fits-all easy fix. Organisations, including those headquartered outside the UK, need first to establish whether the law applies to them or to their subsidiaries, and to ensure that their statements are approved and published in accordance with the specific requirements of the act. They need to consider questions such as where to focus their resources, what changes may be needed to their policies and contracts with suppliers, what training should be provided to their staff, suppliers and agents, and how they can measure progress. </p> <p> More fundamentally, organisations need to consider how best to respond in the event that they find slavery in one of their suppliers (and, if they don\u2019t, whether they are looking hard enough). What would be the consequences of breaking the contract, not only for the organisation itself but for the workers of the supplier? If the contract was continued, how could the slavery be eliminated and what is their legal exposure for as long as the slavery continues?</p> <p>Previously, these may have been questions to which many companies could turn a blind eye.

The use of Nauru as a dumping ground for refugees originated in 2001, following the so-called Tampa affair, in which the then Australian government, under then-prime minister John Howard, despatched commandos to board a Norwegian vessel that had rescued asylum seekers from a foundering boat in the Indian Ocean. </p> <p>The aim of the mission was not to aid the captain of the MV Tampa (who, with his crew, later received the UNHCR\u2019s highest honour, the Nansen Medal), let alone those he had rescued, but to prevent the asylum seekers from disembarking on Australian soil. The reason was that the Howard government felt increasingly threatened by a far-right political grouping, the One Nation party led by Pauline Hanson, and saw a policy of hostility to refugees \u2013 a kind of \u201csoft Hansonism\u201d \u2013 as a way of recovering rightwing support.</p> <p>At this point, Nauru entered the picture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/a-short-history-of-nauru-australias-dumping-ground-for-refugees\">A failed Pacific microstate</a> with an avaricious and unscrupulous leadership \u2013 Nauru in the late 1990s reportedly laundered more than <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/10/magazine/the-billion-dollar-shack.html?pagewanted=all\">US$70bn for the Russian mafia</a> \u2013 it was the perfect partner for an Australian refugee dumping exercise. </p> <p>To nurture an arrangement for this to happen, Australia agreed to provide over A$1m to pay the unpaid debts owed by Nauruans to Australian hospitals, as blatant a bribe as one could imagine. And since then, Nauru has done very well as Australia\u2019s new friend. In the May 2015 Australian budget, Nauru, with an Australian detention centre, was slated to receive aid funding amounting to $2,120.00 per person per year in aid. By contrast, Afghanistan was slated to receive A$2.63 per person per year in aid.</p> <p>What made Nauru such a ideal partner? Two factors essentially came into play. The first was Nauru\u2019s nominal status as a \u201csovereign state\u201d. While Nauru in practice is best described as a \u201cmendicant\u201d or even \u201cprostitute\u201d state, its formal status has allowed Australia to put forward the legal fiction that the treatment of refugees on Nauru is a matter for Nauru, not Australia. This, of course, is pure fiction: the reality is that Australia pays the bills, and contractors to the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection act as \u201cservice\u201d providers. </p> <p>The other factor favouring Nauru is that accountability mechanisms can be avoided. Those on Nauru are beyond any protective jurisdiction of independent Australian courts, or the investigative capacity of the Australian Human Rights Commission. Even the media are constrained: potentially-critical journalists do not receive visas, and just to be on the safe side, Nauru imposes a non-refundable $8,000 visa fee for media applicants.</p> <p>It goes almost without saying that in Nauru itself, there are no independent sources of protection for refugees. Police investigations of complaints, even of serious crimes, are virtually non-existent, and the rule of law collapsed when the Melbourne-based <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/20/nauru-deports-its-only-magistrate-and-bars-chief-justice-from-entering-country\">chief justice was refused a visa to return, and the chief magistrate was deported</a> from the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may be that even as devastating a collection of materials as the Nauru files will do little to shift current Australian policy. The present prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, once seen as a moderate, was returned to office in the 2 July 2016 election with only 76 seats out of 150 in the House of Representatives. He is very much beholden to the right wing of his own Liberal party, including his Peter Dutton, his ultra-conservative minister for immigration and border protection. </p> <p>He may also feel dependent on Hanson, who through a quirk of the electoral system secured election to the Senate, along with three of her followers. In addition, he is hostage to his repeated claims that the harsh regime on Nauru is necessary to stop refugees from risking their lives by boarding boats \u2013 although deterrence without attention to root causes of movement does not save lives but simply shifts deaths to other parts of the world. (And <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=43xdUUx4ISsC&amp;pg=PT55&amp;lpg=PT55&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cthe+more+boats+that+come+the+better%E2%80%9D+wikileaks+malcolm+turnbull&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-z3LXKk7Vm&amp;sig=UjII3OSzk2pjOknaS3NxdQQ6ZVg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5sYSDsMzOAhUBrJQKHaxuC9kQ6AEIMDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cthe%20more%20boats%20that%20come%20the%20better%E2%80%9D%20wikileaks%20malcolm%20turnbull&amp;f=false\">we know from Wikileaks</a> that when he was opposition leader in 2009, one of his key strategists told the US Embassy that the issue of boats was \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cthe more boats that come the better\u201d because of the political embarrassment it caused the Labor government).</p> <p>Yet he may also care for his historical reputation.

The future of the case is now unclear, especially since a decision on the suit\u2019s class action certification is still pending before the ninth circuit court of appeals.</p> <p>Should Uber win that appeal \u2013 which <a href=\"http://www.law360.com/articles/806053/9th-circ-leans-toward-restoring-uber-arbitration-pacts\">some analysts suggest</a> is likely \u2013 the scope of the suit would be substantially reduced, from 240,000 drivers to 8,000 drivers, and Uber could end up on the hook for much less than $84m.</p> <p>Those drivers not included in that reduced class would have to pursue claims against Uber individually, through arbitration.</p> <p>\u201cWe are prepared to start bringing these claims individually, and more than 1,000 drivers in California have already signed up with us to bring individual claims in arbitration if that becomes necessary,\u201d Liss-Riordan said.<br></p> <p>Uber reached the settlement agreement with Liss-Riordan in April 2016, following three years of litigation over the question of whether Uber drivers are employees or independent contractors. </p> <p>By classifying drivers as independent contractors, Uber avoids substantial costs, such as minimum wage, overtime, healthcare benefits, and expense reimbursements. Independent contractors are also ineligible to form unions. </p> <p>Under the terms of the proposed settlement, Uber drivers would have remained independent contractors, but the company agreed to some non-monetary changes to its policies, including allowing drivers to accept tips.</p> <p>Chen questioned the worth of the non-monetary agreements, however, writing: \u201cMuch of this non-monetary relief is not as valuable as the parties suggest ... Uber may be permitting tipping, but it is also telling riders <em>not</em> to tip, further decreasing the amount of tips riders are likely to give\u201d. </p> <p>The proposed settlement was harshly criticized by many labor advocates and drivers, especially after it was revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/09/uber-drivers-class-action-lawsuit-potential-payout\">Uber could have been forced to pay $852m</a> in damages if it had lost the case in court. </p> <p>Notably, the original plaintiff in the case, Douglas O\u2019Connor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/16/uber-plaintiff-speaks-out-settlement-lawsuit\">filed an objection</a> to the settlement, stating: \u201cUber drivers are being sold out and shortchanged by billions of dollars while sacrificing the determination of their classification as employees.\u201d</p> <p>In his ruling, Chen noted that \u201cthe vast majority of class members are slated to receive less than $100 each from the settlement.\u201d <br></p> <p>But the judge\u2019s chief objection to the settlement was the disposition of a claim brought under California\u2019s Private Attorney General Act (PAGA). </p> <p>The 2004 state law allows for individual employees to bring claims against employers over violations of state labor law \u2013 an action that would usually be performed by state enforcement agents. </p> <p>\u201cWhere plaintiffs bring a PAGA representative claim, they take on a special responsibility to their fellow aggrieved workers who are effectively bound by any judgement,\u201d Chen wrote. </p> <p>In the proposed settlement, Uber and Liss-Riordan agreed to accept $1m for the PAGA claim, but a representative of California\u2019s labor &amp; workforce development agency estimated that the potential penalty for Uber under the law would exceed $1bn.</p> <p>\u201cPlaintiffs propose settling PAGA for only 0.1% of the potential verdict value, a reduction that the [Labor &amp; Workforce Development Agency] has found has no rational basis,\u201d Chen wrote. <br></p> <p>In the longterm, it is possible that the question of drivers\u2019 employment classification will become moot.

In other words, a restriction on the sort of revelations broadcast by Four Corners. </p> <h2><strong>George Brandis</strong> </h2> <p>The attorney general, George Brandis, was one of the leading proponents of the repeal of 18C and drafted amending legislation so that we would have more room to express our inner bigot. He has since toed the government line and says an amendment is \u201cnot on the table\u201d. Yet while he was pushing this odd free speech barrow people may have found it \u201cpassing strange\u201d, to use one of the attorney general\u2019s favourite expressions, to know he had wanted a book critical of his hero, Sir Robert Menzies, <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Row-over-tyrant-Menzies-library-book/2006/10/24/1161455704923.html%3CBR%3E\">removed from a school library</a> and he wrote a <a href=\"http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/556710/24027522/1386475644660/Brandis_free_speech_injunctions.pdf?token=h222ORYJI7XqCo2ybZXzugzlFZ8%3D\">paper calling for defamation remedies</a> to include injunctions against media publications. </p> <h2><strong>One Nation</strong> </h2> <p>Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation party also sees 18C standing in the way of free speech for ordinary Australians. However, Pauline Hanson successfully applied to the Queensland courts to <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/04/1062548963055.html\">ban the broadcast of a satirical song called \u201cBackdoor Man\u201d</a>, revealing that in her mind freedom of expression is a selective commodity. </p> <p>A book published in her name, Pauline Hanson \u2013 The Truth, made a number of ludicrous claims, including that Aboriginal women ate their babies. When a racial vilification case was brought against the book, it was defended under the RDA exemption for publishers acting reasonably and in good faith.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/18c-wont-stop-mature-debate-on-race-but-small-mindedness-and-arrogance-might\">18C won\u2019t stop mature debate on race. But small mindedness and arrogance might | Dean Sherr</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Bob Day</strong></h2> <p>Senator Bob Day is in the front line of attacks on 18C yet Family First, his political party, is wedded to some pretty repressive views about freedom of expression. When the Labor government\u2019s internet filtering project was under discussion in 2008, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/family-first-demands-wider-internet-filters/2008/10/27/1224955948624.html\">Family First wanted X-rated and refused classification material banned</a> for everyone \u2013 including adults. </p> <h2><strong>James Paterson</strong></h2> <p>James Paterson, a Liberal senator from Victoria, is<strong> </strong>also selective about what information should be in the public domain. When a big-wig at the Institute for Public Affairs, he refused to discuss with this reporter the institute\u2019s staffing arrangements. He even said that \u201cno comment\u201d was \u201coff the record\u201d. Free speech is all very well as long as you\u2019re not free speaking about the IPA\u2019s internal affairs. </p> <p>Ultimately, reform and strengthening of the section 18D exemptions might have been a more constructive way to approach the issue, rather than sloppy, lazy and unhinged assaults on the race hate provision itself. </p> <p>Serious improvements to free speech are well overdue. While the fraudulent war on 18C has been under way there has been no focus on the real inhibitors to freedom of speech: defamation law, disclosure penalties under the Border Force Act, the ever-increasing flow of suppression and take-down orders issued by the courts, penalties for protesting, the lamentable state of FOI and whistleblower protections, even criminal sedition laws. </p> <p>All of those restrictions are nothing compared to the freedom to be able to scream \u201cape\u201d at an Aboriginal football player.</p>",
  "<p>A meeting of state and territory energy ministers will tackle secret long-term gas contracts in an effort to make the sector more competitive, the federal environment and energy minister has said.</p> <p>Speaking to ABC\u2019s AM on Friday, Josh Frydenberg took aim at the opaque contracts\u2019 role in raising the price of domestic gas.
