  "<p>The simplicity and low cost of tools to edit the genetic code means \u201cgarage scientists\u201d - or amateurs with some skill - can now perform their own experiments, posing a potential risk from the release of GM bugs, a <a href=\"http://%20www.nuffieldbioethics.org/genome-editing\">new report</a> suggests.</p> <p>In a report published on Friday, the <a href=\"http://nuffieldbioethics.org/\">Nuffield Council on Bioethics</a> said that the rise in precision \u201cgene editing\u201d tools had revolutionised biomedical research over the past ten years and could potentially have a dramatic impact on human society.</p> <p>But it found that the materials needed to perform basic experiments were available to enthusiasts outside academia and established labs. This year, one firm began to sell a kit for \u00a3100 to DIY biology interest groups that allowed them to render the common soil microbe, E coli, resistant to the antibiotic streptomycin. </p> <p>The report goes on to say that genetic technology has become so powerful that nations need to decide whether or not doctors should ever be allowed to modify the human species.</p> <p>While the creation of GM humans is not on the horizon yet, the risks and benefits of modifying a person\u2019s genome - and having those changes pass on to future generations - are so complex that they demand urgent ethical scrutiny, the review found.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis could transform our range of expectations and ambitions about how humans control our world,\u201d said Andrew Greenfield, a geneticist and chair of the Nuffield Council\u2019s working group. \u201cAlthough most uses so far have been in research, the potential applications seem to be almost unlimited.\u201d<br></p> <p>Genome editing has become a common tool in laboratories around the world. The most common technique, called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/10/crispr-genome-editing-dna-upgrade-technology-genetic-disease\">Crispr-cas9</a>, works like a pair of molecular scissors. It is essentially a pair of enzymes that can be designed to find and remove a specific strand of DNA inside a cell, and then replace it with a new piece of genetic material. The procedure can be used to rewrite single letters of genetic code and even whole genes.<br></p> <p>The report found that gene editing could potentially block the inheritance of cystic fibrosis and more than 4000 other known conditions caused by single faulty genes. But the technique may also drive profound changes in farming, the report found, where the possibilities range from swine fever-resistant pigs, chickens that only give birth to females, and hornless cows that could be housed in smaller spaces. Because Crispr-cas9 does not leave any traces, meat and other products from GM animals could find its way to market without being labelled. Meanwhile, the simplicity and low cost of Crispr-cas9 means amateurs in the home can now perform their own experiments.</p> <p>Altering the genetic makeup of a human embryo and transplanting it into a woman is banned in Britain, but there are ethical arguments in favour of the procedure, such as preventing children from inheriting genes that cause fatal diseases. But if the procedure were allowed, some fear it could open the door to what the report calls \u201cconsumer\u201d or \u201cliberal eugenics\u201d where children are modified to suit their parents\u2019 preferences.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve identified human reproductive applications as an area that demands urgent ethical scrutiny and we must consider carefully how to respond to this possibility now well before it becomes a practical choice,\u201d said Karen Yeung, a law professor at King\u2019s College London, and co-author of the report.<br></p> <p>Scientists have already begun to edit the genes of human embryos, but only for basic research. Earlier this year, researchers in China tried to add HIV resistance to human IVF embryos which had been donated to science when tests found them to be unviable. The experiments did not achieve their goal, but highlighted how difficult the procedure was likely to be in humans.<br></p> <p>In 2015 another Chinese team became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/apr/23/scientists-genetically-modify-human-embryos-in-controversial-world-first\">first in the world to edit human embryos</a>, when they tried, and failed, to modify a gene that causes beta-thalassaemia, a potentially fatal blood disorder. Again, the work was performed on abnormal IVF embryos donated to research.<br></p> <p>From a purely medical standpoint, there are good reasons to correct faulty genes at the embryo stage, because the defective DNA is then erased from every cell in the body. The risk comes when the modification has unintended consequences. This could harm not only the child, but their future children, because the altered gene would be in their sperm or eggs.<br></p> <p>In light of the report, the Nuffield Council has set up two new reviews to look specifically at the ethics of gene editing in human reproduction and livestock. One major question will be where to draw the line on what is acceptable if gene editing is approved in humans, in principle. It may be morally acceptable to correct a faulty gene that will definitely pass on a fatal disease to a child. But what about a gene that has a chance of raising by 10% a person\u2019s risk of heart disease or Alzheimer\u2019s? The report notes that in the future, it may be possible to enhance people with genes from other organisms, for example to improve night vision and sense of smell.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is only right that we acknowledge where this new science may lead and explore the possible paths ahead to ensure the one on which we set out today is the right one,\u201d said Yeung.</p>",

As expected, Rooney is on the (defender-free) bench. Mourinho\u2019s spin yesterday was that it would be a risk to the player\u2019s confidence to deploy him at the moment, especially as he had a back niggle earlier in the week. But this match would surely have been an excellent chance for Rooney to bang in a goal or two and restore that confidence. The probability, then, is that Mourinho would prefer Ibrahimovic to avail of that chance because the Swede will be more important to United this season than Rooney will. And Ibrahimovic could do with a good performance because he\u2019s been sub-standard in recent outings, raising tentative questions as to his ability to sustain the bright form he showed at the very start of his United career. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ed4458e4b035c40686bb65\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T18:15:15.912Z\">7.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Teams:</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>United</strong>: Romero; Fosu-Mensah, Bailly, Smalling, Rojo; Fellaini, Pogba; Lingard, Mata, Rashford; Ibrahimovic</p> <p><em><strong>Subs</strong>: Johnstone, Carrick, Schneiderlin, Martial, Young, Memphis, Rooney</em></p> <p><strong>Zorya</strong>: Shevchenko; Sivakov, Chaykovsky, Kamenyuka, Petriak, Kulach, Forster, Karavaev, Ljubenovic, Grechyshkin, Sobol</p> <p><strong>Subs</strong>: Chuvayev, Sukhotsky, Gordiyenko, Lipartia, Paulinho, Opanassenko, Chercher</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong>: O Greinfeld (Israel)</p> <p><strong>Referee observer</strong>: L Medina Cantalejo (Spain), thousands of fans at Old Trafford, millions of TV viewers and tens of mbm readers. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T20:05:42.162Z\">at 9.05pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ecf408e4b035a82dd5a12d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T11:00:56.476Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome to a meeting of unequals. Manchester United are embarrassed to be in the Europa League again, whereas Zorya Luhansk are thrilled to be in it for the first time ever. A win for the Ukrainian club would make this one of the most memorable nights in both clubs\u2019 histories for very different reasons. But that seems a highly unlikely outcome, unless Jose Mourinho secretly wants his team to be eliminated so he can be rid of a pesky competition and concentrate on getting back into the Champions League via the Premier League. On the face of things, however, Mourinho is deadset on victory, both to make up some of the ground lost against Feyenoord in the first group game and to avert another outbreak of the negativity with which he says some of his tender young players struggle to cope. United are expected to field a strong lineup and we\u2019ll go through it as soon as it\u2019s revealed. In the meantime, here\u2019s Jonathan Wilson on Zorya Luhansk\u2019s success in exile:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the fact that United sent their scout to watch our game against Vorskla,\u201d the Zorya Luhansk coach, Yuriy Vernydub, said this week, which makes a change from those managers who try desperately to hide themselves away from future opponents. \u201cBefore, they used to say that no one knew about Zorya, whereas now scouts are watching our boys. It means that the players deserve that.\u201d</p> <p>Zorya have particular reason to want to be known: their very existence in European competition feels like a triumph. In June 2014, the Ukrainian club were forced to flee Luhansk because of the conflict with pro-Russia separatists who founded the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic. Zorya\u2019s home ground, the Avangard Stadium, suffered heavy shelling.</p> <p>They moved to Zaporizhzhya, 400km to the south-west, where they play home games at the Slavutych Arena. Its address, just over the road from the Museum of the History of Warfare on Bulvar Lobanovskoho, gives an indication of Zaporizhzhya\u2019s main place in Ukrainian football history: it was there in May 2002, leading his Dynamo Kyiv side against Metalurh, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/15/guardianobituaries.brianglanville\">Valeriy Lobanovskyi</a>collapsed in the dug-out, dying a few days later in hospital.</p> <p>Vernydub\u2019s spirit of openness also makes a significant change from how things used to be in Zaporizhzhya. In Soviet times it was closed down because of its role in the energy industry, the site of both Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant and a huge hydroelectric dam (Zaporizhzhya means \u201cbeyond the rapids\u201d).</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/29/zorya-luhansk-manchester-united-europa-league\">Read the full article here.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T16:45:42.908Z\">at 5.45pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>Although they\u2019ll take it as one if they think it\u2019ll help, it\u2019s no slight on the Melbourne Storm that Sunday\u2019s grand final buildup appears to be all about their opponents, the Cronulla Sharks.</p> <p>It\u2019d be enough if that were simply because the Sharks have never won a premiership since joining the top flight in 1967 \u2013 a wait so long that should Cronulla win on Sunday long-time supporters may feel disorientation amongst the elation, as so much of what came to define their team will no longer be true.</p> <p>But 50 years of successfully avoiding success is one thing; another is recent history. Just two years ago Cronulla were a basket case and, worse, an embarrassment. Many league fans might have been prepared to look the other way had the NRL taken the Sharks for a long drive \u2013 to Perth or purgatory, whatever came first. That year the sponsor-less Sharks finished last and the position flattered them. However, their measly five wins and a points differential of -279 were merely sniffles when measured against a body wracked on a cellular level.</p> <p>The Sharks were a club in crisis, one reeling from the tail-whip of the 2013 Asada scandal. The club faced a $1m fine, staff were sacked, coach Shane Flanagan was suspended for a year, interim coach Peter Sharp, beaten and bowed, later resigned, captain Paul Gallen, among others, accepted backdated bans, and star forward Andrew Fifita publicly flirted with rugby union and Canterbury (before changing his mind). </p> <p>To top it all off, five-eighth Todd Carney wrote himself a new entry in the Bumper Book of Boofheads by urinating into his own mouth while on camera. Not even this major role in contributing to the national vocabulary (it\u2019s called \u201cbubbling\u201d, kids) was enough to save his skin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71c9c912b70d69bf7ef0c412429abb3bed6dbde0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71c9c912b70d69bf7ef0c412429abb3bed6dbde0/0_163_3914_2350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cronulla star Michael Ennis with fans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thumbs up: Cronulla star Michael Ennis laps up the grand final week buzz with Sharks fans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt King/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years on and the Sharks are in the grand final. <em>The Sharks are in the</em> <em>grand final</em>. It barely computes. But, 2014 aside, the Sharks have been building for this since 2012 when, with Flanagan overseeing an overhauled squad, they finished seventh. After finishing fifth in 2013, the Sharks threatened again in 2015, performing promisingly on the back of their experienced forwards and integrating the youthful skills of Valentine Holmes and Jack Bird. It was looking good until the Cowboys thumped them 39-0 in the semi-finals. Yet again the Sharks\u2019 \u201cUp, Up Cronulla\u201d team song appeared to have written for ironic purposes.</p> <p>But the Sharks have progressed this year with a well-balanced squad; equal parts flair and grit, youth and experience (the Sharks\u2019 grand final squad, in terms of their combined first grade games, will comprise the most experienced team in NRL grand final history \u2013 which should help keep nerves under control). The arrival of new halves Chad Townsend and, in particular, James Maloney, coincided with, or triggered, an Indian summer for the likes of Michael Ennis, Luke Lewis, Wade Graham, Gallen and Ben Barba, the latter of whom is back to something resembling his best.</p> <p>With hit-up king Fifita popping offloads like a pi\u00f1ata leaks lollies, points have flowed (24.3 per game in 2016 compared to 19.5 last year), and the back three of Barba, Holmes and Sosaia Feki have scored 50 tries between them. At the same time the Sharks\u2019 defence has tightened up (16.8 conceded compared to 19.8). Mid-year they put together a 15-match winning streak so impressive that one was forced to ignore the weight of history and declare them a real chance. That is, until they then won just one in six leading into the finals, allowing both Melbourne and Canberra to overtake them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/29/cronullas-potential-drought-breakers-the-nrl-grand-final-fairytale-that-isnt\">Cronulla's potential drought-breakers: the NRL grand final fairytale that isn't | Sam Perry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Would we really have been surprised if they\u2019d then bowed out in straight sets? No, but in a sign that this Cronulla side has the ability to do what no other Cronulla side has done \u2013 sides that have included Tommy Bishop, Greg Pierce, Steve Rogers, Gavin Miller, Andrew Ettingshausen, and David Peachey \u2013 the Sharks showed togetherness and resolve to pick themselves up and see off the Raiders and, most clinically and impressively, the Cowboys. In doing so they have reached their first decider since the Super League grand final of 1997 and, before that, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ElAM7fzjR4\">1978 NSWRL grand final</a>. </p> <p>In theory this makes the Sharks this year\u2019s fairytale story, bearing in mind that media bylaws demand there be one for promotional purposes. But to be honest, given Cronulla\u2019s various scandals and the on/off-field behavioural history of the likes of Gallen, Fifita, and Ennis \u2013 men as hard to love as sand in your gusset \u2013 the Sharks\u2019 fairytale is more like something from the oeuvre of the Brothers Grimm than Disney. Cronulla are not really a team towards whom neutral fans would be inclined to feel any particular warmth, but a win on Sunday might well induce widespread sentimentalism and an acceptance that after all this time, all this pain, the Sharks have earned such joy.</p> <p>If the Sharks aren\u2019t universally loved then neither are the Melbourne Storm who, in NSW at least, will forever be tarred with the Original Sin of being based in Victoria and of being born out of Super League in the way <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7CEbd7ffNw\">Damien (of The Omen)</a> was born of a jackal. Oh, and there\u2019s the don\u2019t-mention-the-war matter of the salary cap rorting that saw the Storm stripped of both their 2007 and 2009 premiership titles. Still, you\u2019d have to be wilfully stubborn to overlook the Storm\u2019s continued ability to stay at or near the top year in, year out.</p> <p>In fact, ahead of what will be the club\u2019s 500<sup>th</sup> game on Sunday, and their sixth grand final in 11 seasons, they have the greatest winning percentage of any first grade team in rugby league history (63.5%). Yes, there\u2019s an asterisk against Melbourne\u2019s name for many of those years, but even after shedding players to belatedly abide by the salary cap in 2010, the Storm haven\u2019t faded away as many thought they might have. Or should have.</p> <p>Helmed by Craig Bellamy \u2013 a man who can wring blood from a stone; a man whose game-day passion keeps Windex in business \u2013 they are as well-drilled as the North Korean military during Kim Jong-un\u2019s birthday parade. New players come in and fall into stride. This year, even a season-ending injury to someone as brilliant and influential as Billy Slater wasn\u2019t enough to derail them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37e58d9d1ef67f04f671bb6c27d83e34606098c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37e58d9d1ef67f04f671bb6c27d83e34606098c1/0_125_3550_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Storm coach Craig Bellamy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Storm coach Craig Bellamy is looking to pilot another Melbourne triumph in Sunday\u2019s NRL grand final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The steadying influence of their talismans Cameron Smith and Cooper Cronk cannot be overestimated. Nor can their footballing brains. How reassuring and nerve-settling for some of the Storm\u2019s younger players to look across the dressing room and see them lacing up their boots. With this pair playing the role of coaches on the field (and, in Smith\u2019s case, the referee too), the Storm have been a model of consistency, as their minor premiership attests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/28/win-or-lose-on-sunday-storms-craig-bellamy-is-the-greatest-nrl-coach-ever\">Win or lose on Sunday, Storm's Craig Bellamy is the greatest NRL coach ever | Nick Tedeschi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fullback Cameron Munster, in Fijian wingers Suliasi Vunivalu and Marika Koroibete, they have line-breaks and finishing prowess. With leading forwards Jesse Bromwich and Tohu Harris they have muscle and offloads.

It allows them, as with last week\u2019s preliminary finals against Canberra, to score just 14 points and win. The ability of that defence to hold firm on Sunday will go a long way to determining the result of the grand final.</p> <p>Cronulla, less reliant on structure, appear to have the edge in attack. Could they also have an edge in desire, one underlined by their club\u2019s empty trophy cabinet? Captain Paul Gallen, for one, wondered if he\u2019d retire without ever playing in a season decider, let alone winning one, and he knows well enough that it would be foolish to expect another chance to come his way.

It is also worth noting that Saudi Arabia\u2019s output usually ebbs after the domestic peak in demand in the summer, so a production cut may have little impact on the country\u2019s exports.<br></li> <li><strong>A final risk for OPEC is that higher prices, if sustained, risk incentivising production outside OPEC, notably in the US</strong>.

This time is different.</p> <p>\u201cSaudi Arabia is betting that a small cut will pay for itself through higher oil prices and hence higher revenues,\u201d said Jamie Webster, a fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York.</p> <p>It\u2019s not as if the pump-at-will policy hasn\u2019t had its moments. Saudi Arabia has achieved some of its objectives. Low prices tossed water on the U.S. oil boom, and energy companies have cut as much as $1 trillion in new projects, creating a possible supply hole in the next decade. The kingdom has also scared investors who are now more likely to think twice before plunging money into risky oil ventures. And from the U.S. to China, sales of gas-guzzling cars have soared, bolstering demand.</p> <p>For all the justifications, the last two years haven\u2019t panned out as Riyadh thought they would. At home, the kingdom has burned through more than $150 billion of foreign-exchange reserves, government contractors have gone unpaid, and this week the king announced unprecedented pay cuts for civil servants.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-28/in-u-turn-saudis-pick-cash-over-flirting-with-free-oil-markets\">In U-Turn, Saudis Choose Higher Prices Over Free Oil Markets</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ecd018e4b07eb0f44b8519\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:26:30.987Z\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another interesting chart, from Morgan Stanley, showing how Opec can struggle to stick to its production targets (the blue line):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/781408909701545984\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MS: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Opec?src=hash\">#Opec</a> Intervention Not As Good As It Sounds as there is a history of cheating. <a href=\"https://t.co/sLcudBR2Qf\">pic.twitter.com/sLcudBR2Qf</a></p>&mdash; Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/781408909701545984\">September 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:26:44.961Z\">at 9.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57eccd1ce4b07eb0f44b8509\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:18:06.871Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Goldman Sachs aren\u2019t terribly impressed with the Opec deal either, and aren\u2019t changing their oil price forecasts.</strong></p> <p><strong>Goldman </strong>analysts still expect US crude oil (or West Texas Intermediate (WTI) ) to hover around $43 a barrel for the end of this year and $53 a barrel in 2017.</p> <p>They told clients that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf this proposed cut is strictly enforced and supports prices, we would expect it to prove self-defeating medium term with a large drilling response around the world.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>But there\u2019s also no guarantee that Opec members will stick to the script, as:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cCompliance to quotas is historically poor, especially when oil demand is not weak.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/28/goldman-sachs-opec-production-cut-deal-doesnt-change-oil-price-forecasts-through-2017.html\">CNBC has more details</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CarolinCNBC/status/781372311400251392\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Goldman Sachs: OPEC oil deal doesn&#39;t change our price outlook <a href=\"https://t.co/SfAtbsyHQP\">https://t.co/SfAtbsyHQP</a></p>&mdash; Carolin Roth (@CarolinCNBC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarolinCNBC/status/781372311400251392\">September 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eccb2ae4b0c6325341f21a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:10:03.994Z\">9.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"08dd807a5e1ae6bc108e36982d84e35dfb70b65f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08dd807a5e1ae6bc108e36982d84e35dfb70b65f/0_0_3900_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The national flag of Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Just in...

But is this now a generation in crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Young women are more than three times as likely as their male peers to have PTSD; just 3.6% of men in the age group age had it, the report by NHS Digital said. In addition, women that age are more likely than any other group to have experienced a common mental disorder (CMD) in the past week, according to the in-depth study of 7,500 people of all ages. Researchers found that more than one in four (26%) of women aged 16 to 24 had anxiety, depression, panic disorder, phobia or obsessive compulsive disorder. Overall, 19% of women of all ages had one of those, compared with 12% of men.</p> <p>Sally McManus, the lead researcher in the survey, said: \u201cWe know that there are things like violence and abuse that are strongly associated with mental illness.\u201d But, she added: \u201cThis is also the age of social media ubiquity. This is the context that [young women] are coming into and it warrants further research.\u201d</p> <p>Addressing the smaller numbers of 16- to 24-year-old men with one of those conditions, the report said: \u201cThe gender gap in mental illness had become most pronounced in young people, and there is evidence that this gap has widened in recent years.\u201d While caution was needed due to some of the sample sizes being relatively small, the findings about young women were consistent with those uncovered recently by other researchers and also the <a href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/\">Children\u2019s Society</a>, it added.</p> <p>Reports of self-harm among 16- to 24-year-olds doubled in men to 7.9% and trebled in women to 19.7% between 2007 and 2014. The report acknowledged that the rises could be due to changes in reporting behaviour and people feeling more able to disclose that they had self-harmed. But \u201cit is possible that increased reporting of self-harm reflects a real increase in the behaviour\u201d, it said.</p> <p>Rates of serious mental illness have remained largely unchanged among men over the years that they have been rising among women. The proportion of the overall population with a common mental disorder has risen steadily since the survey was first conducted, in 1993. That has gone from 6.9% of 16- to 64-year-olds in 1993 to 7.9% in 2000, then to 8.5% in 2007 and now to 9.3%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T11:10:25/embed.html\" data-alt=\"PTSD graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T11:10:25/embed.html\">PTSD graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The report says: \u201cIncreases in CMD were driven by rises in women; the prevalence of CMD symptoms in men had remained broadly stable since 2000.\u201d While 10% of women exhibited symptoms of more serious mental illness, only 6% of men did.</p> <p>Kate Lovett, dean of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said more research was needed to fully understand the rise in PTSD, but said rape or other sexual abuse were possible triggers. She said the rise in chronic mental illness among 16- to 24-year-old young women was clearly worrying, with social media a likely key contributor.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first age group that we have had coming to age in the social media age,\u201d Lovett said. \u201cThere are some studies that have found those who spend time on the internet or using social media are more likely to [experience] depression, but correlation doesn\u2019t imply causality.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cThese figures highlight worrying trends, particularly regarding the growing number of young women accessing mental health treatment. Society is changing \u2013 even in the last seven years, social media, for example, has increased in popularity and the number of platforms people might be present on has multiplied.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result, young people are facing unprecedented pressures, not just over the emergence of cyberbullying and revenge porn, but constant exposure to unattainable aspirations of what they should look like, and be like.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T10:56:54/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Mental health graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T10:56:54/embed.html\">Mental health graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Doctors and mental health campaigners said the findings were alarming and called for urgent improvements in NHS psychological and psychiatric services, including for young adults.</p> <p>Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity <a href=\"http://www.youngminds.org.uk/\">Young Minds</a>, said the gender gap that emerged from the report might be explained by the sexes reacting differently to troubling events. \u201cThe gender difference can be associated with the different ways young men and young women respond to distress,\u201d she said. \u201cYoung men tend to externalise pressure \u2013 for instance by being angry or violent \u2013 while young women are more likely to internalise their feelings, and take them out on themselves, for example by cutting or through eating disorders.\u201d</p> <p>The research, which was undertaken for NHS Digital by the National Centre for Social Research in collaboration with Leicester University, also found that:</p> <ul> <li>17% of people have a common mental disorder.<br></li> <li>37% of people who have anxiety or depression get treatment for their condition, up from 24% in 2007.<br></li> <li>One in three people now undergo some form of treatment for their illness, either counselling or medication, compared with one in four in 2007.<br></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T10:55:49/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T10:55:49/embed.html\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Paul Farmer, chief executive of the charity <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/\">Mind</a> and chair of the NHS\u2019s recent taskforce on mental health, said while the growing numbers in treatment was welcome, untreated mental illness was still a huge problem. \u201cIt\u2019s still clear that nowhere near enough people are getting the support they need \u2013 in fact, more people than not are getting no treatment at all,\u201d he said.</p> <ul> <li>Prof Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \u201cWith just one in three people with a mental illness receiving treatment, the need for mental health services is far outstripped by the demand.\u201d<br></li> </ul> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Health said the government was increasing investment in mental health services with an extra \u00a31bn every year until 2020.

I couldn\u2019t get myself in touch with reality. </p> <p>\u201cThe treatment was mainly medication and spending time in hospital recovering. I don\u2019t feel I got the treatment I needed \u2013 I needed someone to speak to, a therapist or counsellor. My feelings weren\u2019t really addressed, I wasn\u2019t listened to. It was: \u2018We\u2019ve given you medication and hope you\u2019re OK.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI ended up having to help myself. I am quite lucky I found the strength to help myself as not everyone would have that. I was discharged way too early, I had to learn to look after myself and manage my mental health alone. It made me more ill initially until I said: \u2018I\u2019m alone, I have to do it [myself].\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve recovered \u2013 it\u2019s about keeping in touch with reality so I don\u2019t slip into the dark places. I have night terrors; I can wake up and not feel like I\u2019m in reality, I can have dreams of what happened to me that seem real. There\u2019s always a worry that I\u2019ll be ill again and the worry is that I won\u2019t get the help I need again.</p> <p>\u201cPTSD is an illness that isn\u2019t recognised enough and finding that support can be quite difficult. Everyone in mental health knows about it but I don\u2019t think they fully understand it when I say what\u2019s happening to me. I wasn\u2019t surprised [about the results of the survey], I think it\u2019s a very common illness but other people might be surprised.</p> <p>\u201cProfessionals need to dig deeper and see what traumatic events have happened in your past. The biggest problem I hear from other people is there is not enough support.\u201d </p> <ul> <li>As told to Haroon Siddique<br></li> </ul> <h2><strong>\u2018Social media makes it harder to tune out things that are traumatic\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Kerry Mae-Doogan, 21, is from Wigan</em><br></p> <p>\u201cI was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2010 when I was 14. I was the victim of a sexual assault and thought I could handle it, but then I reached a crisis point and was referred to children\u2019s mental health services where I got cognitive behavioural therapy. I didn\u2019t find it helpful and ended up discharging myself. Since then, I\u2019ve had no other formal treatment, and dealt with it on my own.</p> <p>\u201cFor me the symptoms of PTSD include anxiety and panic attacks, so I wouldn\u2019t go out after dark because it would make me too anxious and I don\u2019t like being alone in my house. I used to have flashback nightmares quite regularly and developed insomnia as a result.<br></p> <p>\u201cOver the past few years, my condition has improved through recognising the triggers \u2013 and being careful not to put myself in vulnerable situations helps. I also have really supportive friends and practise meditation and mindfulness regularly. Now if I have a panic attack I know how to calm myself down. So I have learned how to manage my condition and if I need to do something in the evening then I will arrange for a friend to come with me.<br></p> <p>\u201cCertain things still make me feel more anxious, however, like watching sexual assault on TV; that can be upsetting and I don\u2019t really like going out to places I am unfamiliar with.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/23/university-mental-health-services-face-strain-as-demand-rises-50\">University mental health services face strain as demand rises 50%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe last time I had a PTSD attack was more than a year ago. That was triggered by being stressed about university: I had just moved into halls. I was overwhelmed by this and had an anxiety attack as a result. In the end I decided that \u2013 at that time \u2013 university wasn\u2019t for me and I needed to build up to it. I am now in an apprenticeship.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re having a flashback or panic attack it feels like you\u2019re drowning in the weight of what\u2019s happening and you can see what is in front of you but at the same time your mind is in the past. It\u2019s hard to interact with the present when your mind is constantly trying to take you back to what has happened.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of PTSD being an issue for women and the report doesn\u2019t surprise me. Lots of people go through awful experiences and PTSD is also being more recognised than it used to be; there\u2019s a rising awareness about it. This means now a lot of young women are more willing to go to a doctor and seek help if they have issues.<br></p> <p>\u201cSocial media makes it harder to tune out of things that are traumatic and would trigger flashbacks or anxiety attacks \u2013 especially in TV and in films.

  "<p>Anyone expecting the revolution will surely have walked into Liverpool\u2019s gleaming Convention Centre and wondered where it was. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\" title=\"\">Labour party conference</a> might now be Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s domain, but it was all surprisingly familiar: a great wall of men in dark suits, fringe meetings with titles like \u201cWhat\u2019s ahead for consumers in a digital future?\u201d \u2013 and, by way of a cruel pantomime, the disoriented sons and daughters of the Blair-Brown years, still wondering how to respond to what has happened \u2013 and, on the evidence I glimpsed, not getting much further than mouthing such tired tropes as the need for \u201can over-arching narrative\u201d.</p> <p>In glaring contrast, the most fulfilling and enjoyable event in Liverpool was <a href=\"http://theworldtransformed.org/\" title=\"\">The World Transformed</a>, the five-day \u201cfestival of politics, art and culture\u201d put on across town by Momentum. Here, most of the sessions \u2013 spread around a church-turned-arts centre, which felt as homemade and human as the official conference was cold and alienating \u2013 were designed to allow as much participation as possible, and thereby spark the maximal level&#xa0;of&#xa0;debate. You could tell something exciting was afoot by the hubbub that extended from the tiny reception area out into the street, and beyond.</p> <p>I spent a day there, contributing to an invigoratingly non-doctrinaire conversation about the politics of Englishness \u2013 and then watching a two-hour session that spoke volumes about one of left politics\u2019 emerging fault lines. This debate was titled \u201cBuilding a progressive majority\u201d. On one side sat two people close to the Corbyn project: the veteran Labour leftie and Momentum founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/08/momentum-corbyns-shock-troops-labour\" title=\"\">Jon Lansman</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rheawolfson\" title=\"\">Rhea Wolfson</a>, a Scottish Momentum activist recently elected to Labour\u2019s national executive. On the other were the chair of the left pressure group Compass, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/neallawson\" title=\"\">Neal Lawson</a>, and the Green party\u2019s co-leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carolinelucas\" title=\"\">Caroline Lucas</a>. Around 200 people participated: as the conversation went on, it became both more impassioned, and increasingly&#xa0;fascinating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f13bd647ea3983bf279fcd9b7c7fd11c2bf930ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f13bd647ea3983bf279fcd9b7c7fd11c2bf930ef/1396_1112_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If you want a sense of a remodelled Labour party, think of Jonathan Reynolds happily in alliance with Clive Lewis [pictured].\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you want a sense of a remodelled Labour party, think of Jonathan Reynolds happily in alliance with Clive Lewis [pictured].\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lansman is a fantastically capable organiser, with an instinctive understanding of many of the tensions and complications of Corbyn and his allies\u2019 position, and an honest sense of Momentum as \u201ca work in progress\u201d. But he is also someone apparently too reluctant to move away from the verities of the last century. The Green party, he suggested, might be a laudably progressive setup, but it might be best off simply merging into Labour, like the Co-operative party did back in 1927. Proportional representation, he reckoned, was much less of an issue now the Labour party was on the road to internal democracy \u2013 and, in any case, remained a dangerous idea, which supposedly gifted small parties with too much influence and would adversely affect the left\u2019s chances of acquiring power.</p> <p>Wolfson parried points about Scotland with formulaic jibes against the SNP (\u201cNationalists!\u201d shout far too many Labour people, as if that will settle the matter), full of the idea that sooner or later the straying Scottish millions would come back to their natural political home. It made for an odd spectacle: people from the supposed radical left, with instincts that were often disappointingly conservative.</p> <p>A lot of the audience had a rather different take. Some said their affinity with Labour was complemented by occasions when they had voted for other parties. They liked Caroline Lucas, a lot. They also liked the idea of, as one speaker put it, \u201cnegotiating the future\u201d via a revolutionised voting system, rather than imposing it with the support of a small minority of the electorate.</p> <p>These were not the hardliners and ideological desperadoes that some people might imagine: their politics felt open, self-critical and realistic about the huge tasks it faces. They may not yet have a clear idea of how a new left politics might decisively cohere \u2013 but no one (not even gobby newspaper columnists) does, as yet. The point is to at least begin with a sense of how it might start to mesh, and the breadth of people who will have to be involved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/corbyn-urges-labour-mps-to-end-trench-warfare-and-back-socialist-vision-for-uk\">Corbyn urges Labour MPs to end 'trench warfare' and back socialist vision for UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are deep and overlooked differences between these people and some of the Labour voices currently shouting the loudest.

On the left, some people seem nostalgic for the 1970s; on the right, eyes mist over at the mention of the 1990s.

Over the next few months, pay attention to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/labour-party-must-hold-together\" title=\"\">Jonathan Reynolds</a>, the Greater Manchester MP \u2013 tipped for a return to Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet \u2013 and representative of Labour\u2019s supposed \u201ccentre\u201d, who enthusiastically makes the case not just for changing the voting system and calling time on Labour\u2019s monopolisation of left politics, but a <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/welfare/2016/02/how-i-learnt-stop-worrying-and-love-basic-income\" title=\"\">universal basic income</a> (interests he shares, incidentally, with the shadow chancellor, John&#xa0;McDonnell).</p> <p>To get a sense of a remodelled Labour party that might eventually emerge from all this turbulence, think of Reynolds happily in alliance with, say, <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2016/07/clive-lewis-and-jonathan-reynolds-it-is-time-for-labour-to-embrace-pr/\" title=\"\">Clive Lewis</a>, the Corbyn loyalist whose travails on Trident pointed to a politics grounded not just in a quest for a radically different Labour politics, but also a smart sense of priorities.

Politicians have to talk about single electoral cycles; journalists and commentators too often seem unable to conceive of things in any other terms. But anyone with any grasp of Labour\u2019s predicament well knows that reinventing its politics will be a much more onerous business, spread over a longer time frame. The hoary old Gramsci quote about pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will just about fits the essential story. This remains a deep crisis, too often worsened by the politics of the past, on both left and right. But there are also tantalising glimpses of the future, and plenty of reasons to keep faith.</p>",

As the licence bounced to other companies, third and fourth versions were brought out, most recently in 2006 with a version that used digital audio cartridges instead of cassettes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BK6M5XUgOqQ/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Sneak peek from @ttpmofficial at Dallas Toy Fair! \ud83d\udc3b#TeddyRuxpin is coming back!</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Wicked Cool Toys (@wickedcooltoys) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-09-28T18:18:50+00:00\">Sep 28, 2016 at 11:18am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>\u201cTeddy Ruxpin\u2019s play-pattern and infusion of technology was way ahead of his time back in the 80s, and with continued massive parental awareness it\u2019s the right time to bring back this coveted brand,\u201d said Michael Rinzler, founding partner of Wicked Cool Toys, in a statement back in February. </p> <p>The latest version of the toy comes with a 4GB hard drive that can store 40 stories and can be paired with an iPad app so children can read along to the stories as the toy \u201cspeaks\u201d.

  "<p>Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures were partially responsible for reversing a massive growth in the use of a controversial provision of the Patriot Act for acquiring email and other so-called \u201cbusiness records\u201d, the US justice department\u2019s internal watchdog has found.<br></p> <p>The Patriot Act provision, known as Section 215, permits intelligence and law enforcement agencies to acquire from a service provider records of someone\u2019s communications \u2013 such as phone calls or email records \u2013 that are relevant to a terrorism or espionage investigation.</p> <p>In June 2013, the Guardian, based on Snowden\u2019s leaks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">revealed</a> that the Bush and Obama administrations had secretly been using Section 215 to acquire Americans\u2019 phone data in bulk. The revelation led Congress to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/02/congress-surveillance-reform-edward-snowden\">significantly curtail</a> domestic bulk phone records collection in 2015. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2016/o1604.pdf\">new report</a> from the justice department inspector general reveals that around 2009, the FBI began encountering resistance from email providers and others to a highly controversial nonjudicial subpoena for records, known as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/17/fbi-national-security-letters-nick-merrill-surveillance\">National Security Letter</a>. In the wake of this, the FBI began acquiring the information it sought through warrant requests to the Fisa court, a secret surveillance panel, using Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which the inspector general notes is a slower process.</p> <p>\u201cTransactional records for email,\u201d says the heavily redacted report, were \u201cthe most common type of records requested\u201d outside of bulk data collection, which the inspector general set aside. </p> <p>The shift resulted in an \u201cexponentially\u201d increasing FBI appetite for email and other records under the Patriot Act provision. In 2009, the Fisa court approved 21 such requests. By 2012, it had approved 212. A single order can encompass many people\u2019s records.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/washington-post-wrong-edward-snowden-pardon\">The Washington Post is wrong: Edward Snowden should be pardoned | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Between 2012 and 2014, the Fisa court issued 564 such orders, which the inspector general called \u201ca dramatic increase\u201d. Between 2007 and 2009, the court issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/21/fbi-patriot-act-doj-report\">only 51 orders for domestic email and internet metadata</a>, according to the previous inspector general\u2019s report on Section 215 issued last year.</p> <p>The Fisa court, the inspector general has now found, \u201cdid not deny any business records applications\u201d made between 2012 and 2014. </p> <p>But Snowden\u2019s revelations, beginning in mid-2013, helped shift the FBI away from using Section 215 to acquire email and other metadata. The Fisa court approved warrants to collect non-bulk business records 179 times in 2013, a number falling to 142 times in 2015 \u2013 though this was still a vast increase on the 21 approved in 2009. </p> <p>A senior national security official with the justice department told the inspector general that a \u201cstigma\u201d had been created around the Patriot Act provision, even outside of the bulk collection that privacy advocates rallied to stop.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible that folks \u2026 have decided it\u2019s not worth pursuing [business records orders], you know, obviously things haven\u2019t been great since Snowden either,\u201d the report quoted the unnamed official as saying. </p> <p>The justice department disputed Snowden\u2019s impact on the shift as \u201cspeculative\u201d and indicated that the data collection did not stop, so much as shifted legal justifications.</p> <p>Just as the 2009-era resistance to National Security Letters spurred the bureau to rely on Section 215 and the Fisa court for email and other records acquisition, the justice department\u2019s national security division told the inspector general that the FBI now uses a different authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, for its email collection.</p> <p>Section 702, passed in 2008, permits the US government to collect large amounts of Americans\u2019 international communications, provided that no \u201cUS person\u201d within the country is an explicit target of the surveillance dragnet. The Fisa court reviews procedures for the collection but not the actual collection itself. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2016/sep/19/how-to-contact-the-guardian-securely\">How to contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barack Obama voted in favor of the measure, which became a wellspring for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">the NSA\u2019s Prism program</a> and its \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/3\">upstream</a>\u201d siphoning of data transiting across the internet\u2019s fiberoptic backbone, while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/110-2008/s168\">voted against it</a>. Civil libertarian groups contend that Section 702 is unconstitutionally broad. The authority is set to expire in 2017 unless it is renewed by Congress. </p> <p>The justice department did not release many specific numbers documenting the scope of the surveillance under Section 215. Charts explaining changes to the FBI\u2019s data collection patterns were blacked out of the public version of the inspector general\u2019s report. </p> <p>In 2013, after Snowden\u2019s revelations began, numerous FBI, National Security Agency and other US officials claimed Section 215 was vital for the prevention of domestic terrorism, a claim they subsequently walked back for lack of evidence.

He then talks to \u201ca good number\u201d of BHA folk. \u201cI sense, if I may say so, an acceptance among the majority that the disciplinary system can be improved.\u201d</p> <p>In the disciplinary panel\u2019s terms of reference he finds an instruction that it must be led by the BHA board. \u201cIt appears to permit the board unfettered right or power to guide the panel on policy ... or even in relation to a specific case.\u201d He finds no evidence that this has ever happened and recommends the words be excised forthwith.</p> <p>He points out the \u201ctension\u201d in Stier\u2019s role, responsible for the stewarding team but also for the disciplinary panel that often reviews stewards\u2019 decisions. Then he asks about the appointment system for the panel, which is where his eyebrows creep to their highest point.</p> <p>\u201cThis gap in my knowledge was shared by many of my consultees, some of whom I might have expected to know,\u201d he remarks, frostily. He finds no set procedure for the appointment of the two lawyers who have served as panel chairmen for 11 years, nor any document explaining when and why racecourse stewards were given a judicial role on the panel. In the Quinlan-designed future there will be more lawyers but no stewards.</p> <p>Those who remain on the panel will have security of tenure, Quinlan having removed the BHA\u2019s right to fire them at three months\u2019 notice, except in cases of misconduct. \u201cI am not suggesting that the BHA would, for example, remove a member simply because it disagreed with a decision,\u201d he says. But the mischief might be done if a panellist merely feared that could happen.</p> <p>In the most gentlemanly way, Quinlan urges future panels to criticise the BHA where appropriate, a thing from which panels have so far shrunk. \u201cA disciplinary tribunal would not wish to be perceived as partial,\u201d he writes. \u201cMaking proper comment, including criticising a party or person or procedure ... helps to prevent any incorrect perception.\u201d</p> <p>What is missing is any general insistence on openness as a guiding principle. Quinlan does not call for publication of the minutes of disciplinary panel meetings nor for outside observers to be admitted. He does not ask that media access to BHA hearings be extended beyond \u2018running and riding\u2019 cases.</p> <p>Still there is hope for a much better system if his review is implemented in full. The question now is whether the BHA can continue to make good decisions after Quinlan has left the building.</p>",
  "<p>Just as doctors have a duty of care and respect to their patients, so the rest of us have an obligation to doctors. It is a basic tenet of civilised societies that medics should be allowed to care for the sick and wounded in wartime as well as in peace. The concept of medical neutrality was enshrined in the first Geneva convention more than a century and a half ago, and over those years it has offered countless doctors, nurses and their patients a degree of protection in the cruellest times. Attacking medical facilities, transport and personnel intentionally is outlawed.</p> <p>No one should need to be reminded of that; yet it appears that we must be \u2013 repeatedly. In May, the security council <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53844#.V-0iMtfd5Rk\" title=\"\">adopted a resolution</a> to strengthen protection for healthcare workers, the sick and wounded, and hospitals and clinics in war zones. The measure was prompted by increasing assaults on such facilities; according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, 959 people were killed in 600 such attacks in 2014 and 2015 alone. It has proved fruitless. The strikes are now so frequent they are in danger of being normalised. On Wednesday the United Nations secretary general was forced, for the second time in four months, to spell out international law\u2019s protection of medical services and its demand that the wounded and sick, whether civilians or fighters, be spared: \u201cDeliberate attacks on hospitals are war crimes. Denying people access to essential healthcare violates international humanitarian law.\u201d</p> <p>Ban Ki-moon spoke hours after the two largest hospitals left in rebel-held areas of Aleppo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/aleppo-two-hospitals-bombed-out-of-service-syria-airstrikes\" title=\"\">were bombed out of service.</a> <a href=\"http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/\" title=\"\">Physicians for Human Rights</a> says there were 382 attacks on 259 health facilities in the country between March 2011 and June this year, killing 757 medical personnel. There can be no doubt that many of those have been targeted. The bald numbers fail to capture the true impact: murdering a dozen doctors may cause the deaths of hundreds or even thousands of civilians, who are either too frightened to access healthcare or are simply left without services at all. Those who attack facilities intentionally know that they are destroying the morale of the communities they serve. Such assaults are intended to exacerbate suffering and drive people from contested territory.</p> <p>Syria is far from an isolated case. In South Sudan, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya and many more places, healthcare workers are suffering. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has been forced to withdraw from the north of Yemen following the fourth attack against its facilities by the Saudi-led coalition in less than a year, killing 32 and injuring 51. The US and UK are not only failing to rein in Saudi Arabia, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/the-guardian-view-on-yemen-stop-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia\" title=\"\">continue to sell it arms</a>.</p> <p>And though Monday will mark the first anniversary of the US bombing which killed 42 at an MSF hospital at Kunduz in Afghanistan \u2013 including patients who burned in their beds and medics attacked as they fled the building \u2013 the organisation <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/04/pentagon-hospital-attack-report-falls-short\" title=\"\">still awaits an independent investigation</a>. In that case, as in Yemen\u2019s, the facility was targeted despite the fact that MSF had repeatedly given its location; and the strike continued despite MSF alerting US forces that they were hitting a medical facility. As the organisation\u2019s president observed earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53844#.V-0iMtfd5Rk\" title=\"\">four of the five permanent members</a> of the security council have, to varying degrees, been associated with coalitions responsible for attacks on health structures.</p> <p>It is important to acknowledge profound differences between cases. In Syria, attacks are routine and clearly intentional; there is little doubt that the Assad regime and its allies are calculatedly hitting the healthcare system. Reckless as well as deliberate actions can be war crimes. But it is significant that MSF continues to share the coordinates of its facilities in Afghanistan and Yemen, to protect them. In Syria, it keeps them secret.</p> <p>In all instances, however, medics not only deserve to work safely; they have a right to do so. States must adopt clear policies for their militaries and train personnel accordingly. Attacks upon health workers and their workplaces should be investigated and documented thoroughly. Where countries fail to hold fighters to account for human rights violations, they should be pursued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/the-guardian-view-on-syria-the-ceasefire-and-the-aid-convoy-attack-a-new-low\" title=\"\">internationally</a>. A dedicated UN high representative, as suggested by MSF, would help to keep the issue on the agenda. We must refuse to accept strikes on facilities and staff as aberrations or \u2013 worse \u2013 as a new rule of war, if doctors and the patients they so courageously serve are to be protected.</p>",

The mainstream parties took fright and abandoned PR and the FN won no seats at the following election. This trickery merely aided the party and its support increased in 1993 and 1997. Marine Le Pen reached 17.9% in the 2012 presidential election, and two years later the FN gained control of 14 local councils.</p> <p>The lesson is that relying on electoral sleight of hand rather than argument and debate helps populist parties.

Technology will have rendered submarines obsolete by the time Trident could be built. The US and China are already well advanced in developing underwater drones and sensor technology.

  "<p>If you ask Wall Street, Twitter is in trouble. The user-base is growing, but <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-11/twitter-falls-after-analysts-downgrade-stock-on-slow-growth-view\">not quickly enough</a>. Ad revenue is growing too, but <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-05-24/twitter-s-advertising-sales-growth-is-even-worse-than-it-appears\">not as quickly as it once did</a>. The only answer to this leveling-out, it seems, is the platform\u2019s acquisition by a bigger corporate bird, which can regurgitate an influx of capital and absorb our tweets into its own data-craving metabolism. Disney, Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are all circling above Twitter\u2019s wobbly stock price, salivating.<br></p> <p>For lots of us users, it\u2019s a different story. Twitter is pretty great. We reporters rely on its instant access to the chatter of the world more than we like to admit. The running commentary of friends and celebrities has turned horrible presidential debates and State of the Unions into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000\">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>. And the platform nurtures communities fighting for justice; historian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntheaButler\">Anthea Butler</a> has argued, for instance, that Black Twitter has come to inherit the mantle of the Black Church. It also delivers us frequent access to Donald Trump\u2019s id, if we want.</p> <p>The trouble is, Wall Street\u2019s economy has become Twitter\u2019s economy, even if Wall Street\u2019s view of the platform\u2019s usefulness isn\u2019t necessarily our view. But what if we changed Twitter\u2019s economy? What if users were to band together and buy Twitter for themselves?</p> <p>This is the kind of thinking at work in the <a href=\"http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/ours-to-hack-and-to-own/\">growing movement</a> for <a href=\"http://internetofownership.net/about/what-is-platform-cooperativism/\">platform cooperativism</a> \u2013 a series of experiments in shared ownership and governance for online platforms. But it\u2019s an old idea, too. When I mentioned a Twitter buyout to co-op and crowdfunding veteran <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daspitzberg\">Danny Spitzberg</a>, he reminded me of the Green Bay Packers. Have you ever wondered why the small-ish city of Green Bay has held on to its really good football team? It\u2019s because, rather than being traded around by billionaires, the team started selling shares to its fans, starting in 1923. That has resulted in sold-out games, affordable ticket prices, tasteful stadium advertising, and an <a href=\"http://www.leagueoffans.org/2012/04/06/green-bay-packers-ownership-structure-remains-the-ideal/\">all-around successful, sustainable business model for generations</a>.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure many of us have ideas about how we could make Twitter meet our needs better. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bfwriter/status/779491611256377344\">One suggestion</a> that came my way: \u201cactually moderating threats and hatespeech.\u201d But what would it take to put Twitter in the hands of those who rely on it most?</p> <p>Armin Steuernagel, founder and managing partner at the innovative new investment firm <a href=\"http://purpose.ag/\">Purpose Fund</a>, suggested to me that it could go down this way: assemble a company and invite investment for shares that grant dividend rights, but not voting; gather about 20% of the funds needed for the buyout, then borrow the rest, and buy. As for the voting rights, they\u2019d be distributed according to a \u201cladder of engagement,\u201d including investors and general users, but allocating more control to those who contribute the most value to the platform, such as employees and the most active users. Finally, there could be a few \u201cgolden shares\u201d with veto rights, perhaps controlled by a foundation representing all users.</p> <p>It\u2019s a long-shot, Steuernagel admits, but he points out that this kind of thing recently worked with Prokon, a sizable wind-power company that escaped bankruptcy and buyout by <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/investors-rescue-wind-developer-prokon/a-18558732\">converting to a cooperative</a>.</p> <p>Robin Chase, founder of Zipcar and author of <a href=\"http://www.peersincorporated.com/\">Peers Inc</a>, wonders whether Twitter\u2019s current leaders could play a role. \u201cCould existing employees (or founders) who believe in such a purchase,\u201d she wrote in an email, \u201cbe willing to roll-over some of their stock into the new ownership structure?\u201d We might also need to ask <a href=\"http://qz.com/519388/this-saudi-prince-now-owns-more-of-twitter-than-jack-dorsey-does/\">this Saudi prince</a>.</p> <p>Another suggestion <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/investors-rescue-wind-developer-prokon/a-18558732\">comes from Tom McDonough</a>, a blogger with a history in capital markets, who proposes that less than 1% of users \u2013 no small number, at three million \u2013 could each buy $2,300 worth of shares and vote as a bloc for a transition to cooperative ownership. They\u2019d then be paid back through the transition process, partly through a membership fee that could average to $10 each year. Rather than giving the company a blank check to sell your data, would you pay a co-ownership fee?</p> <p>There are other possibilities as well. Using the Jobs Act, which now allows <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/crowdfunding-and-jobs-act-what-investors-should-know\">equity crowdfunding</a>, a buyout could be funded with small investments from millions of people. Even the US government could step in, recognizing Twitter as a public utility and helping to orchestrate the conversion \u2013 just as it has in financing rural electric co-ops since the 1930s, which have become vehicles for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/USDARDSmartGridBOC2015.pdf\">broadband expansion</a> today.</p> <p>Twitter\u2019s impending transition need not be, for most of us, merely a time to wait and see. It can be a chance for us to discuss, scheme, and organize. What would be an appropriate <a href=\"http://www.bkconnection.com/books/title/owning-our-future\">ownership design</a> for the Twitter we know and love, and how do we get it there? How can we make sure that the future of the company serves those who depend on it most, who most want see it succeed culturally, technologically, and financially?

  "<p>This month, Sex returns to the city: an infamous play written by and starring the budding starlet Mae West in the 1920s. After a 10-month run on Broadway in 1927, the play was deemed by a grand jury to be such \u201cobscene, indecent, immoral, and impure drama\u201d that it might corrupt \u201cthe morals of youth\u201d. <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/scandals/mae-west-2012-4/\">West was sentenced to 10 days in jail for obscenity</a>, and travelled there in style \u2013 garlanded in roses, wearing silk underwear and riding in a limousine. </p> <p>The notoriety helped the actor, who said she had \u201c<a href=\"http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/maewest105997.html\">climbed the ladder of success wrong by wrong</a>\u201d. Several years after the Sex scandal, Paramount Pictures offered West \u2013 then aged 38 \u2013 a studio contract. She went on to become one of the best-known and best paid stars of the era: legend has it that, by 1935, she was the second-highest paid person in the US behind the publisher William Randolph Hearst. Even more impressive than West\u2019s salary, or her age when she commandeered Hollywood, was the control she held over her career. The breezy, bawdy characters she played were partly of her own design, thanks to a deal she negotiated with Paramount allowing her to write her own lines.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJS670okmZc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FJS670okmZc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Now, the play that propelled her into the spotlight is coming back to New York where it will be performed as a staged reading (29 September to 2 October). It is being produced by the feminist theatre group, <a href=\"http://www.thedirtyblondes.org/\">the Dirty Blondes</a>, to kick off their residency with the <a href=\"http://www.horsetrade.info/frigid-festival\">Frigid festival at Horse Trade theatre group</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMae West used her sexuality to obtain power. She turned it on its head by being this brave and intelligent artist,\u201d says Ashley Jacobson, the artistic director and co-founder of the Dirty Blondes. \u201cShe was more than a Hollywood bombshell: she was an artist who created the work that she wanted for herself.\u201d </p> <p>Sex\u2019s lead character, Margy LaMont, is a sharp-witted sex worker who struggles to find a better life. \u201cShe\u2019s an intelligent woman, but you can feel the shackles placed on her as a woman in the 1920s,\u201d says Elizabeth Sarkady, the co-founder and executive director of the Dirty Blondes (as well as the manager of business development at <a href=\"http://www.bam.org/?gclid=CjwKEAjw97K_BRCwmNTK26iM-hMSJABrkNtblE7DhGI8-IAY8HLa4UT-EXbh6fcUsqUZ-xTopQuejRoCn_vw_wcB\">BAM</a>). \u201cMargy can\u2019t escape what she is and what she does without a man.\u201d </p> <p>Margy wants to find a new life by marrying a well-to-do man, and the play deals with her choice between two suitors. \u201cOne is a young man who doesn\u2019t know anything about her but wants to marry her in a well-intentioned act of ownership,\u201d Jacobson says. \u201cThen there\u2019s a long-term client who knows and loves her for exactly who she is.\u201d One man represents a complete escape from her life while the other symbolizes Margy accepting who she is. \u201cThe play is about how she can claim power within the confines of being a woman and a sex worker in the 1920s,\u201d Jacobson says. \u201cIn the play, every woman is reduced down, as though all they offer is sex \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Sex.\u201d</p> <p>A key feature of the readings will be the special events taking place after each performance. Jacobson and Sarkady have invited guests to take part in talkbacks, such as the artist <a href=\"http://juniperfleming.com/\">Juniper Fleming</a> \u2013 who has previously directed, produced and performed in an all-sex worker revival of Sex. \u201cWe wanted to walk about the history of the play and the issues around it, so the talkbacks are a huge part of what we want to do,\u201d Jacobson says. Other guests include the historian <a href=\"https://www.dramatistsguild.com/memberdirectory/getmembership.aspx?cid=12981\">Linda Ann Loschiavo</a>, an expert in West; the feminist poet <a href=\"http://www.mayaosborne.com/readings\">Maya Osborne</a>; and the burlesque dancer <a href=\"http://dangerdame.com/diary/\">Veronica Varlow</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to honor West\u2019s legacy by putting this play in context,\u201d Jacobson says. </p> <p>The play is a somewhat unusual choice for the Dirty Blondes, which typically focuses on work with and by living artists. Since being founded in Brooklyn in 2012, it has produced 15 pieces of new theater and worked with more than 340 artists. \u201cWe want to support work that is daring, socially aware and adventurous, and we really want to push social advocacy in theatre,\u201d Jacobson says. \u201cWe hope the plays we put out there propel a larger mission. Some have a feminist point of view, while others are more general \u2013 but all of them have a bit of bite.\u201d</p> <p>One such example is <a href=\"http://www.thedirtyblondes.org/the-american-play.html\">The American Play</a>, a work written by Jacobson about two young men obsessed with the serial killing protagonist of American Psycho, Patrick Bateman. The Dirty Blondes\u2019 production was lauded by critics as \u201craw, contemporary and edgy\u201d, \u201c... honest and frightening\u201d and \u201cincredibly refreshing\u201d, and won an award for overall excellence in playwriting at <a href=\"http://fringenyc.org/\">FringeNYC </a>last year.</p> <p>West\u2019s chutzpah resonates with Jacobson and Sarkady. \u201cHer attitude was: \u2018If my friends aren\u2019t getting work, and I\u2019m not getting work then I\u2019m going to create my own work,\u2019 and it really helped her career,\u201d Jacobson says. \u201cThat really speaks to us, especially as two female founders. We want to say that we have as much right to be here as anyone else. We shouldn\u2019t be in women-only festivals. Mae West was such a big star and she really controlled her career image. If she can do it, then we all can do it, too.\u201d</p>",

Unfortunately, however, sharks - primarily their fins - are also found in UK restaurants, adding to the threat facing many shark species, including those already considered endangered. </p> <p> </p> <p>Shark fin cartilage is usually shredded and used primarily to provide texture and thickening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/mar/10/shark-fin-soup-a-dangerous-delicacy-for-humans-and-sharks-alike\">shark fin soup</a>, a traditional Chinese soup or broth considered to be a luxury item embodying notions of hospitality, status and good fortune. In the EU, regulations were strengthened in 2013, with the requirement that sharks must be landed with fins naturally attached - a method widely acknowledged as the most reliable means for implementing a finning ban. This was a vast improvement on the original 2003 legislation, which outlined a fin landing weight of 5% ratio of the total shark\u2019s weight. However, it presented a loophole that actually allowed more fins to be landed per whole animal, as the primary fin set actually weighs around 2% of the total body weight.</p> <p>Earlier this year, shark conservation organisation <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bite-back.com/\">Bite-Back</a> exposed another loophole, this time in UK customs regulations. Bite-Back discovered that passengers are allowed to import up to 20kg of dried shark fin in their luggage for personal consumption. To put that into context, 20kg of dried shark fin results in the death of about 12 adult blue sharks (some of the most heavily fished species for the shark fin trade); 1kg of dried shark fin fetches around \u00a3180 on wholesale markets. </p> <p>Bite-Back\u2019s campaign director Graham Buckingham has previously stated that his organisation\u2019s research indicates that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3048340/Shark-fin-soup-menu-dozens-Chinese-restaurants-use-loophole-allows-passengers-bring-personal-consumption.html\">as many as one in five UK Chinese restaurants</a> could be offering shark fin soup. It is often simply called \u201cfish fin soup\u201d, or sometimes not listed at all, despite being available on request. Soup may sound harmless, but this delicacy is having a major impact on shark populations. In fact, in the time it has taken you to read to this point, over 280 sharks will have been killed for their fins (and that\u2019s a conservative estimate).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0740d9f5b38bca893c1f3f98389c10f34572630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0740d9f5b38bca893c1f3f98389c10f34572630/0_799_3456_4385/788.jpg\" alt=\"Fin Fighters co-founders Phil Root and Lou Ruddell (centre) with SharkFest event manager Jasmine Tribe.\" width=\"788\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fin Fighters co-founders Phil Root and Lou Ruddell (centre) with SharkFest event manager Jasmine Tribe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not just the shark fin trade that threatens the survival of shark species: by-catch and habitat destruction also have significant effects on population numbers. Their vulnerability to overexploitation and loss of habitat is due to the fact that the majority of shark species have a slow growth rate, take a long time to reach maturity and have low fecundity in comparison to most teleosts. The status of sharks in European seas is particularly critical with around half of all species being threatened with extinction or at risk of becoming endangered (Fordham, 2006). </p> <p>And so the conservation initiatives of shark and marine organisations are vital when it comes to raising awareness and increasing understanding to the wider public; and what better way to do this than at a dedicated shark festival? Saturday 24 September saw the UK\u2019s first ever Shark Festival, held at The-M-Shed in Bristol, focusing on encouraging positivity, cooperation and active participation in shark conservation.</p> <p>The festival was organised by Jasmine Tribe, a volunteer for conservation organisation <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.finfighters.org/#home1\">Fin Fighters</a>. Co-founded by Lou Ruddell and Phil Root in 2014, the organisation\u2019s mission is to protect sharks worldwide, and to end the sale and distribution of shark fin in the UK by the year 2023.</p> <p>A range of marine organisations and exhibitors attended,including Surfers Against Sewage, Marine Conservation Society, The Shark Trust, The Manta Trust, The Gills Club, Basking Shark Scotland and many more besides, all keen to engage the public. Presentations were delivered by representatives of some of the exhibitors throughout the day, with the event culminating in the exclusive UK screening of David Diley\u2019s film <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ofsharkandman.com/\">Of Shark and Man</a>.</p> <p>The public interest in the event was fantastic: some people had come from all over the UK as well as Europe; other people were just passing by but ended up spending their entire day there. It was really encouraging, as preaching to the converted is one thing, but events that further understanding, change public perceptions and engage a previously indifferent audience are what really matter.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Although people are often fascinated by sharks, engaging them in conservation is a different prospect altogether. A study by Friedrich et al 2014, entitled <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260296222_Public_perceptions_of_sharks_Gathering_support_for_shark_conservation\">Public perceptions of sharks: gathering support for shark conservation</a>, points out that public engagement and support for conservation is limited. The notion of sharks as fearsome predators, cultural representation in movies such as Jaws, plus sensationalist media coverage of shark attacks all contribute to frame sharks negatively in the public imagination. However, the emerging concept of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X11001813\">marine citizenship</a> recognises each member of the public as a potential agent of change to address marine environmental issues through their behavioural choices (Fletcher and Potts 2007, Hamzaki and Tanno 2010). </p> <p>A well-informed public that understands an issue and potential solutions is in a stronger position to exert pressure on policy makers to address environmental concerns. Studies on public perceptions of marine wildlife have found that individuals with high levels of knowledge of and positive attitudes towards animals such as sharks are more likely to support their conservation and avoid behaviour potentially harmful to them (Thompson and Mintzes 2002, O\u2019Bryhim 2009).</p> <p>Across the board, species and habitat conservation is more important than ever before. Here\u2019s hoping that events like SharkFest really get people thinking and working towards a better future for sharks. </p> <h2><strong>References</strong></h2> <p>Fordham, S (2006), Shark Alert.

  "<p>Pepe the Frog originated as an innocuous cartoon character in 2005. This week, he was <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/extremism/adl-adds-pepe-the-frog-online-hate-symbols-database.html#.V-wKyvkrLcs\">added</a> to the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s database of hate symbols. At first glance, it may seem more than a little strange that the <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/pepe-the-frog.html#.V-wK4_krLcs\">image of a cartoon frog</a> could end up alongside such infamous symbols as the <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/blood-drop-cross.html\">Blood Drop Cross</a> of the Ku Klux Klan. But the evolution of Pepe the Frog actually illustrates a key aspect of hate symbols: many such images do not actually begin as hate symbols. </p> <p>We maintain this database as part of our work to track hate groups and help law enforcement, educators and other members of the public to identify those symbols that serve as potential calling cards of extremists and antisemites. What we have learned is that, often, symbols slowly evolve in that direction or are appropriated by extremists from their original context and assigned a new, more hateful meaning.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/swastika.html#.V-wK__krLcs\">swastika</a>, reviled in western cultures as a hateful symbol of the Nazi regime, was originally so innocuous that it was a common graphic design element in American advertising. Even today, the swastika is a popular symbol of good fortune across much of Asia. Context matters.</p> <p>Pepe the Frog came to life in an online comic called Boy\u2019s Club, created by artist Matt Furie. However, the frog soon escaped Furie\u2019s control as fans created their own Pepe images and shared them online, turning the character into a popular internet meme.</p> <p>One of the attractions of Pepe as a meme was that people could place the cartoon frog in virtually any circumstance, depicting him as Shakespeare or a superhero or modern celebrities. </p> <p>This universality, however, was what also soon gave Pepe the Frog a dark side. Pepe appearances were not always innocuous, as people drew him in various sexual, tasteless or otherwise offensive poses and contexts. Some called such images \u201cdark Pepes\u201d.</p> <p>Many of these images appeared first in online discussion forums such as Reddit, 4chan and 8chan. Parts of those forums have well-deserved reputations for antisemitism and bigotry, so it was almost inevitable that racist and antisemitic Pepe images would join other offensive depictions. </p> <p>But many pop culture images, from Bart Simpson to <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/minutes/128099/yes-theres-connection-little-pony-donald-trump-white-identity-politics\">My Little Pony</a>, have been appropriated by white supremacists from time to time, without those pop culture images ever developing reputations as hate symbols. In another universe, Pepe the Frog might have had a similar history. </p> <p>Two developments gave it a very different path. The first was the rise of the so-called \u2018alt right\u2019, a loose network of white supremacists, mostly online, who seek to infuse American conservatism with racism and antisemitism. Pepe the Frog became an unofficial mascot for many on the alt right.</p> <p>The second development was the contentious and controversial 2016 presidential election, which the alt right has vigorously exploited in order to draw attention to itself. Pepe images became a part of this exploitation.</p> <p>Many of these Pepe depictions were not bigoted in nature, but merely supportive of candidate Trump. But offensive Pepe images also grew in number \u2013 and were sometimes even sent to journalists or others who had written or said negative things about Trump. Such usages went part and parcel with the alt right\u2019s use of triple parentheses <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/anti-semitism-usa/adl-to-add-echo-symbol-used-by-anti-semites-on-twitter-to-online-hate-symbol-database.html#.V-wLVvkrLcs\">\u2018echo\u2019 punctuation</a> to single out Jewish journalists.</p> <p>By now, racist and antisemitic Pepe the Frog images have entrenched themselves in the iconography of the alt right. They are used as in-jokes and references among alt right activists or displayed to others in attempts to harass or shock. </p> <p>It is at this point in a symbol\u2019s evolution towards contexts of prejudice and hate that we often consider it for inclusion in our <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/#.V-wLfvkrLcs\">Hate on Display</a> database. In the case of the Pepe image, we decided that inclusion was warranted.</p> <p>This does not mean that all uses of Pepe images should thus be considered racist or antisemitic. Though white supremacists have appropriated the symbol, its usage in other contexts has not stopped. Consequently, we must always be careful never to assume that someone is racist or antisemitic simply because they used a Pepe image that itself is devoid of racism or bigotry. We must always interpret symbols only in the contexts in which they occur.</p> <p>Some Pepe lovers on the Internet have even called for Pepe to be \u201csaved\u201d \u2013 myself included \u2013 to be taken back from the haters. Though not very common, this sort of re-appropriation actually has happened from time to time. The most prominent example is the <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/iron-cross.html#.V-wLnvkrLcs\">Iron Cross</a> symbol, once rarely used outside of white supremacist or outlaw biker circles, but now a very popular symbol used in clothing and accessories. </p> <p>Perhaps something similar can happen with Pepe. For the near future, unfortunately, the cartoon is likely to continue to be exploited by racists and antisemites.</p>",
  "<h2>ON THE WAYNE</h2> <p>Big Vase strugglers Manchester United will attempt to put themselves back on the European map tonight by beating Zorya Luhansk. That sounds like an oxymoron and the Fiver would welcome a cheap laugh in return. But, as it happens, Zorya are are likely to be stronger opponents than you might, what with them representing Luhansk, a city that is a victim of Russian militants\u2019 attempts to redraw the aforementioned European map. That\u2019s got to increase the Ukrainian team\u2019s determination to make as good an impression at Old Trafford as they did when drawing 1-1 with Fenerbahce in their first group match, which was held in a temporary home. What is more, Zorya\u2019s players have reportedly not been paid for six months. All in all, then, their players have a wealth of motivation to excel on their visit to a country where people can allegedly earn anything from \u00a355,000 to \u00a3400,000 just to gallivant around the world chatting about football.</p> <p>It is important to retain a sense of perspective about these things, of course. Zorya\u2019s plight is thrown into sharp relief by the travails of United players such as Wayne Rooney, who has recently had to put up with people noticing his abysmal performances. He also had a bit of a sore back earlier in the week. Under the circumstances, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho thinks it may be cruel to ask the 30-year-old to play this evening. </p> <p>\u201cI am here to protect him, not to put him into difficult situations,\u201d sobbed Mourinho. \u201cWith the situation now created around him he really cannot afford to have a performance that is not really good. I have to analyse if the best thing for him is to start the game. If he is not totally ready for it and I will discuss it with the player and the medical staff, he might start on the bench.\u201d Surely we can all agree that that is the best place for him.</p> <p>The Special One, then, intends to deploy a powerful lineup, as he knows that it is not only Rooney who risks incurring more flak in the event of another inept performance like the ones that preceded last weekend\u2019s blip against Leicester City. \u201cI would say we have to win all of the next four matches, which is difficult,\u201d declared the Portuguese polemicist. \u201cFrom now on the approach will be different, I will be putting more of my key players on the pitch. It is very important that we win.\u201d And win they probably will. Otherwise the Special One can look forward to another wave of Einsteins\u2019 theories. </p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Jacob Steinberg for Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva 1-1 Southampton at 6pm BST and then check in with Paul Doyle from 7.45pm BST for white hot MBM coverage of Manchester United 2-0 Zorya Luhansk.</a></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d94a1e57df309f02b9401a8aae59b55463088806\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d94a1e57df309f02b9401a8aae59b55463088806/0_131_7003_4201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Huw Evans/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy answer would be a big fat no\u201d \u2013 Chris Coleman succinctly sums up the allure of the England job.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY (PART DEUX)</h2> <p>\u201cSo sorry for this story big sam!

That made it far more profitable than the estates of other dead superstars with lasting musical legacies: the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjdm45jmj/2-elvis-presley/#62d408744937\">Elvis Presley estate</a> made $55m in 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjdm45jmj/4-bob-marley/#3a7457ad67b6\">Bob Marley estate</a> recorded revenues of $21m. The reason for the Jackson estate\u2019s spectacular success was one amazing deal: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/sony-michael-jackson-atv-music-publishing-750m\">sale of its remaining 50% stake</a> in Sony/ATV music publishing to Sony Corporation for $750m \u2013 so expensive because ATV had been the publisher for the vast majority of the Beatles\u2019 catalogue. And the profit was enormous: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/14/topstories3.arts\">Jackson had paid $47.5m for ATV in 1984</a>.</p> <p>As the great superstars of rock and pop pass on, estate management has become a huge business. And the claimants to that business are manifold. David Bowie, a man ahead of the curve in looking after his financial interests, might well have prepared thoroughly, but you only need to look at the ongoing court battles over who should benefit from the estate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince\">Prince</a> \u2013 exacerbated by the fact that he left no will and had no known children \u2013 to see how a badly managed estate can cause chaos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a5e46faa2656fb7dd321a75b17ab6012b1a520e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a5e46faa2656fb7dd321a75b17ab6012b1a520e/0_0_1752_2432/720.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Jackson.\" width=\"720\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Jackson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Branca is, along with John McClain, co-executor of the Jackson estate. He was the singer\u2019s lawyer, on and off, for 26 years from 1980, during which time Jackson was the biggest pop star on the planet. Branca was reappointed eight days before Jackson died, having negotiated his return during rehearsals for what would have been Jackson\u2019s comeback shows. And Branca has steered the estate\u2019s business interests over the past seven years to make it the most commercially successful celebrity estate in the world. He and McClain, rather than Jackson\u2019s children, parents or siblings, make all the commercial decisions around the assets \u2013 which include Jackson\u2019s recordings, his songwriting, his share of Sony/ATV, his image rights and his name rights.</p> <p>Refusal is key. Immediately after Jackson\u2019s death, the estate had to address the debts he had run up in his lifetime, so there was a flurry of activity: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-jackson-s-this-is-it\">This Is It</a> documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/15/michael-jackson-the-immortal-world-tour-review\">Cirque du Soleil\u2019s Immortal tour</a> and two documentaries directed by Spike Lee \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/bad-25-spike-lee-review\">Bad 25</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/michael-jackson-journey-from-motown-to-off-the-wall-review-sspike-lee-documentary\">Michael Jackson\u2019s Journey From Motown to Off the Wall</a> \u2013 all got the green light, and proved highly profitable. But, says Branca, \u201cWe say no to almost everything that is pitched to us. I just have a basic philosophy, as I am a huge Michael Jackson fan, where I only do things that I would want to watch or listen to. If we don\u2019t believe it is going to be of the highest artistic quality, we don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>Here, the estate acts as if for an artist who was still alive, but they need to be realistic about their role. \u201cLet me be clear \u2013 John [McClain] and I are not Michael Jackson,\u201d says Branca. \u201cThere is only one Michael Jackson, so we would never pretend that we could substitute our judgment for his.\u201d</p> <p>The key to making an artist posthumously successful lies in the preparations they made when they were alive. \u201cIt all starts with the will,\u201d says Gregor Pryor, a partner at legal firm <a href=\"https://www.reedsmith.com/\">Reed Smith</a>. \u201cSome artists make very good wills and do a really good job of planning for their death. And others don\u2019t.\u201d A music business insider, speaking anonymously, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/freddie-mercury\">Freddie Mercury</a>\u2019s will has become the standard by which other artist legacies are judged. Aware he was dying, Mercury appointed Queen\u2019s manager Jim Beach as executor of his will and his estate. \u201cOther estates, once they have got through the chaos, will want to work towards the steady state that Queen had from the day Freddie died,\u201d the insider says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2e888db92b25c21e7b131ebbcc52e940df2fd30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e888db92b25c21e7b131ebbcc52e940df2fd30/0_0_3000_3258/921.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Horowitz in 1988.\" width=\"921\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Horowitz in 1988.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Estate management is not only an issue for rock stars \u2013 classical musicians, too, need special attention, because the fundamentals are the same. Jeff Liebenson, of the New York music law firm <a href=\"http://www.liebensonlaw.com/\">Liebenson Law</a>, represents the estate of the classical pianist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/31/vladimir-horowitz-original-jacket-collection\">Vladimir Horowitz</a> and explains what happened when his widow, Wanda Toscanini Horowitz, also passed away. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual that when the estate goes to family members, these are often people who are not that familiar with the music business,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are understandably very emotional and have various issues among and between each other. That can make it very difficult for them to move forward together. In the Horowitz situation, there was no family to inherit it. There were designated beneficiaries, charities and academic institutes in the will.\u201d</p> <p>Allan Steckler has worked on the Horowitz estate for 12 years, as well as the Arturo Toscanini estate for 25 years, and previously worked in classical labels and Apple Records in the US. He has overseen the Horowitz estate in a way that would be familiar to those running the Johnny Cash estate, for example: finding previously unreleased recordings of artistic worth, and overseeing their release into a hungry market, the biggest project being the 42-disc collection of Horowitz\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall between 1951 and 1978. \u201cThe challenge with dealing with a deceased artist is keeping them in the public view,\u201d says Steckler. \u201cOnce an artist passes, unless somebody does something to keep the name in front of the public, they will totally fade away.\u201d</p> <p>It is common to view record companies as ghoulishly exploiting the deaths of stars, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOkb58YbtQo\">as depicted in the Smiths\u2019 Paint a Vulgar Picture</a>, where Morrissey castigates greedy labels: \u201cReissue! Repackage! Repackage! Re-evaluate the need.\u201d And it is true that sometimes, with artists who have not left behind a wealth of high-quality unreleased material, but scraps and odds and ends \u2013 and whose estate is bequeathed to people in need of money \u2013 the material that emerges sullies their legacy. But it rarely plays out the way Morrissey suggests, and sometimes the labels can even be helpful.</p> <p>Steve Davis, who was director of catalogue at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/emi\">EMI</a> from 2000 to 2009, gives the example of what they did for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/30/kirsty-maccoll-birthday-album-reissue\">Kirsty MacColl</a>\u2019s family. The singer was killed in December 2000, when she was run over by a speedboat while diving with her sons in Mexico. Eventually, a man admitted to driving the speedboat \u2013 an employee of the multimillionaire who owned it and who was on board at the time \u2013 and was convicted of culpable homicide, but her family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/11/kirsty-maccoll-campaign-anniversary-death\">spent nine years running the Justice for Kirsty campaign</a>, seeking a judicial review of the events surrounding her death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d549612fe20c3170bd40b815fc24c6f7d3cc1630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d549612fe20c3170bd40b815fc24c6f7d3cc1630/0_0_2858_3944/725.jpg\" alt=\"Kirsty MacColl.\" width=\"725\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirsty MacColl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe did a compilation of her work,\u201d Davis says. \u201cHer family were interested in the revenue stream to put towards their campaign.

Cally Callomon is a former creative director at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/mar/23/island-records-fifty-simon-reynolds\">Island Records</a> who has been running the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/05/nick-drake-requiem-for-a-solitary-man\">Nick Drake</a> estate since the late 1990s. Both Drake\u2019s parents are dead, leaving only his sister, Gabrielle, involved. She approached Callomon to manage the estate because she was unable to dedicate the time that it needed.</p> <p>Callomon\u2019s approach was to manage the Drake estate as if he were a living artist. The licensing of Drake\u2019s song <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/apr/25/popandrock4\">Pink Moon</a> for a Volkswagen ad in 1999, and a Radio 2 documentary narrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradpitt\">Brad Pitt</a> in 2004, helped to make the singer considerably more successful posthumously than in his lifetime. \u201cGabrielle got it immediately. This idea of not celebrating or commemorating the death of an artist, but really starting from a complete rebirth of an artist.\u201d</p> <p>Like the Jackson estate, they understand that saying no is more important than saying yes. \u201cGabrielle is a very rare creature and she understands the power of saying no,\u201d Callomon says. \u201cIt\u2019s about waiting for that thing that, when you say yes to it, it makes sense.\u201d They regularly turn down biopic ideas. \u201cTo make a film, however lucrative that would be, I think it would kill something and that would be unforgivable in my book.\u201d Instead, Gabrielle will occasionally approve use of her brother\u2019s music in films or the theatre for free if she likes the script or director, as she is keen to encourage new talent.</p> <p>They have also restricted how much unreleased material has been put out beyond Drake\u2019s original three studio albums \u2013 limiting them to one compilation (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/22/way-to-blue-review\">Way to Blue</a>), two compilations with unreleased tracks (Made to Love Magic and A Treasury) and his pre-Island home recordings (Family Tree). They have also repeatedly turned down offers to put all his material in a box set as they are concerned this will devalue his music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b23b0ee3c75951da57fdbb56c2fc07298839b95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b23b0ee3c75951da57fdbb56c2fc07298839b95/0_0_1862_2872/648.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Drake.\" width=\"648\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Drake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR handout free</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Callomon holds up the example of another beloved, guitar-playing singer who died young as the way not to manage a slender body of acclaimed work. \u201cI have [been] openly critical of the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jeff-buckley\">Jeff Buckley</a>\u2019s legacy has been handled,\u201d says Callomon. \u201cThe guy only made one album but there have been multiple variations of that one album, demos and live material released by Sony. I think Jeff Buckley\u2019s music deserves better than that.\u201d</p> <p>Music fans will now be waiting to see what happens with the cases of Bowie and Prince. Bowie\u2019s back catalogue was already subject to a carefully planned reissue programme before his death, beginning with the Five Years box last September, and followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/22/david-bowie-who-can-i-be-now-1974-1976-album-box-set-review\">the Who Can I Be Now? set last week</a>. At the rate of one box a year, his catalogue could be repromoted over several years. As for Prince, while those close to him try to resolve the disputes over who gets what, the burning question for fans will be what happens to arguably pop\u2019s greatest treasure trove of unreleased material, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/19/i-would-hide-4-u-whats-in-princes-secret-vault\">his legendary vault</a>.</p> <p>It seems as if Colonel Tom Parker\u2019s words, on the death of Elvis, his sole client, in 1977, ring true for all dead superstars: \u201cElvis didn\u2019t die \u2013 the body did,\u201d he said. \u201cThis changes nothing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u2018I was driving on Sunset Boulevard, and I saw this broken-down altar on a corner,\u201d Banks recalls. \u201cIt was crusting and brown and there was trash all around it. And it still looked really sacred for some reason.\u201d The ecclesiastical scrap sighting made such an impact on the singer that she decided to christen her second album in tribute. \u201cMy music is the most sacred, holy thing that I have in my life,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s like my truth; it\u2019s my altar.\u201d</p> <p>The Altar comes three years after Banks\u2019s sultry neo-R&amp;B first got pulses racing. Then, it was stoked by a generous helping of enigma: no photos, no backstory, no social media \u2013 only an elusive mononym to muse on. Yet the mystery is long since solved \u2013 Jillian Banks is a 28-year-old Los Angeleno who was inspired to start writing music as a teenager by Fiona Apple and Lauryn Hill. And while her debut, Goddess, was impressive, it was also slightly formulaic. There have been some questionable live performances, too. All in all, it\u2019s fair to say the past couple of years haven\u2019t quite lived up to the initial hype.</p> <p>There is one person, however, who has most definitely not lost the faith. \u201cI started making music because I needed a place to listen to me. It was like my best friend,\u201d Banks says. \u201cIt still is. It\u2019s still my best friend, my most nurturing, loyal friend.\u201d She might sound a bit <em>much</em>, but this therapy-session intensity is the most powerful tool in Banks\u2019s arsenal \u2013 and it\u2019s what makes The Altar such a compelling listen.</p> <p>Her descriptions of creating particular songs err on the side of melodrama: \u201cWhen I was writing it, I was like I don\u2019t want to fucking say this stuff,\u201d she says of closing track To the Hilt. \u201cI got sick when I wrote it, like, my body wasn\u2019t even ready to confront it, and I got physically sick.\u201d But when you actually listen to Banks starkly trilling that she \u201chated you for leaving me\u201d over a doomy piano riff, it all adds up to something affecting. Forget the inscrutability, or the trendy sound, or even the performance chops \u2013 Banks\u2019s appeal now lies squarely in her emotional expos\u00e9.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fccf71df170f425d57c6a573b6f5390546b1c99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fccf71df170f425d57c6a573b6f5390546b1c99/0_99_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banks performing in Canada last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banks performing in Canada last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a surprise, then, to hear that at the core of The Altar was a cold rationality. \u201cI had a lot of new subjects to tackle,\u201d she says. A major one ended up being her newfound authority in the business. \u201cI have a lot of people who work for me now: as a woman, you have to learn how to be a boss. Sometimes people don\u2019t respect you right away; they don\u2019t listen to what you\u2019re saying because maybe you don\u2019t even understand that you\u2019re the boss. I would have things happen to me where I was like: if I was a guy, would this happen? I don\u2019t think it would. I had to learn how to be unapologetic and unemotional about something that was emotional, which is my music.\u201d</p> <p>First to go was her meekness in rehearsals. \u201cI like a closed soundcheck; there shouldn\u2019t be people watching. Then, on my first few tours the front-of-house guy or the lighting guy would bring people or they would be taking pictures. I would call my manager who was at home and be like, \u2018There\u2019s somebody at soundcheck \u2026\u2019\u201d she says in a timid voice. \u201cWhereas now you have to be like: \u2018There\u2019s no one allowed at soundcheck. I don\u2019t know why anyone\u2019s in here.\u2019 And then everyone calls you a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>Navigating the space between vulnerability and defiance is a big theme on The Altar. On Gemini Feed, Banks sarcastically addresses the boyfriend who has been controlling her (\u201cTo think you would get me to the altar, like I\u2019d follow you around like a dog that needs water\u201d). On Fuck With Myself she removes all power from any prospective manipulators: nobody messes with her mind like she does. The latter had a video in which Banks toys with a bald mannequin of herself, while dancers wearing masks of her face twitch in the background. \u201cI\u2019m becoming more confident with expressing myself visually and dreaming bigger,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Sonically, The Altar very much picks up where Goddess left off. Banks takes cues from 90s R&amp;B, but comes at it from a sideways, almost DIY perspective \u2013 as if she\u2019s reinventing the sound in her own 21st-century, slightly neurotic image. On Gemini Feed, for example, the phrasing is enjambed because of the low register. It\u2019s something TLC used to do a lot, but Banks combines it with the haunting, slightly awkward production of a James Blake track. Yet despite being pretty verbose otherwise, Banks refuses to be drawn on the sound of her songs. \u201cI make my own type of music \u2013 I\u2019m my own genre,\u201d she says serenely. Her sound doesn\u2019t just come out of nowhere, though, does it? \u201cI just write melodies that I need to. And create atmospheres that I need to create,\u201d is all she\u2019ll say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f987ff043b5ec5afe6b02d0c0f78eedd0460683b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f987ff043b5ec5afe6b02d0c0f78eedd0460683b/0_1545_3370_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banks, photographed in east London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banks, photographed in east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She excels, in particular, at creating subtle, sophisticated gloom that comprises two contrasting moods: disquiet and serenity. \u201cI\u2019ve been depressed before, and when I talk about those stages I\u2019ll say: I was feeling so dark,\u201d she says of the former. \u201cBut then you could also say dark in a really beautiful, calm way. Like it was a dark room. They\u2019re so different. One is dark in this gravity-feels-too heavy way, and one is dark in this really peaceful, quiet calm way, and one is negative, and one is really positive.\u201d</p> <p>This shadowy aura, thinks Banks, might be one of the reasons people tend to assume she\u2019s British. \u201cPeople still think I\u2019m from here \u2013 they always say \u2018UK-based singer\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are always like: \u2018You don\u2019t sound as if you\u2019re from California,\u2019 which is so funny because music doesn\u2019t reflect the weather.\u201d Yet it\u2019s not only contemplative grey drizzle that links her to the UK. Banks\u2019s very first label, Good Years, was London-based, and it brought her over to work with British producers including Jamie Woon and Lil Silva. It culminated in an EP she named London, recorded while staying in an Airbnb in east London. \u201cI just thought it was the coolest place in the whole world,\u201d she says. \u201cI started my career off in the UK, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>Neatly, Banks is returning to this hallowed ground for The Altar\u2019s launch next week. She hints that she\u2019s planning some live appearances, too \u2013 they will be among her first performances of the new material, and she\u2019s excited to get to grips with it. \u201cThat\u2019s what is so fun about starting to do this, because you\u2019re like, \u2018Nice to meet you,\u2019 then you make out, then you have sex. That\u2019s what I do with my music, it\u2019s like a process of getting to know it live,\u201d she explains.

Pointing to huge investments made by German carmakers in central Europe, he said: \u201cFor us, the single market, eastern Europe and freedom of movement \u2013 they are all one deal, that is inseparable.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of the Japanese carmaker Nissan, said on Thursday that his company would demand a UK deal offering compensation for any eventual trade costs resulting from Brexit before it committed to more investment in its Sunderland plant. </p> <p>\u201cIf I need to make an investment in the next few months and I can\u2019t wait until the end of Brexit, then I have to make a deal with the UK government,\u201d Ghosn said at the Paris car show. \u201cIf there are tax barriers being established on cars, you have to have a commitment for carmakers who export to Europe that there is some kind of compensation.\u201d </p> <p>In a speech seen as confirming his preference for a hard Brexit, Britain\u2019s trade secretary, Liam Fox, on Thursday hailed Britain\u2019s chance to become a full independent member of the World Trade Organisation after Brexit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/liam-fox-looks-to-wto-in-hint-at-hard-brexit-stance\">and said</a> leaving the EU was a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the UK to trade with the rest of the world, particularly developing markets.</p> <p>A survey of the EU-27 by the Bloomberg news agency also revealed unanimous opposition to the UK remaining a member of the single market if it refused to accept freedom of movement.</p> <p>Positions in Brussels and the other EU capitals were hardening, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-28/-hard-brexit-looms-as-28-red-lines-turn-deeper-shade-of-scarlet\">the survey found</a>, with even traditional allies such as Ireland now insisting Britain should not be allowed to \u201ccherry pick\u201d in upcoming exit negotiations.<br></p> <p>Several countries are demanding Britain end up with \u201cinferior\u201d terms to those it currently has, while others want it to keep paying into the EU budget in exchange for whatever benefits it does get. Some countries, particularly in central Europe, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/eastern-bloc-countries-will-uphold-citizens-rights-to-live-in-uk\">threatened to veto</a> any Brexit deal that does not guarantee the rights of their citizens to live and work in the UK.<br></p> <p>Kerber said an agreement curbing EU immigration while retaining privileged access to the single market was impossible, and the arrangement the British government appeared to be seeking was \u201cnot what the continental Europeans are willing\u201d or even able to give.</p> <p>\u201cIf British decision-makers look very hard at what it is and what it will be that they get, there is no other option than the hard exit,\u201d he said, adding that that might be better than \u201ca fudge in the middle that does not work politically and would leave uncertainty lingering on\u201d.</p> <p>Separately, the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said before a meeting with Johnson in London that the EU referendum had been won by demagoguery, lies, half-truths and exaggerations. He said he was sure Europe could survive, and could only hope for the same for Britain.</p> <p>\u201cThe United Kingdom and the European Union have just been victims, in June, of one of those fits of demagoguery,\u201d Ayrault said. \u201cBrexit will jeopardise neither the European Union, I am sure, nor the United Kingdom, I hope.\u201d</p> <p>He said Brexit was \u201crooted in lies, exaggerations and caricatures, we must remember. I say this with all the more tranquility because the promoters of Brexit after the referendum admitted, on leaving the ship, that their promises were not sustainable. The supreme irony is that they left the burden of the negotiation to a prime minister who campaigned to stay in the union.\u201d</p>",

Acquired by Netflix before its premiere at this year\u2019s Sundance, Anvari\u2019s debut feature is already being talked of as a horror classic. But it is a film that transcends the genre. Yes, it is fluent in standard-issue horror tropes, but it is most notable for the painstaking way Anvari has evoked 1988 Tehran. The film, researched with photos from family albums, shot in Amman, Jordan, with UK money, and spoken in Farsi, is a wholly authentic social-realist drama that morphs, ominously, into a gothic ghost story. It is a film indebted, simultaneously, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/asghar-farhadi\">Asghar Farhadi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/romanpolanski\">Roman Polanski</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/abbas-kiarostami\">Abbas Kiarostami</a> and Jack Clayton.</p> <p>The opening title credits are accompanied by archive footage of bombs dropping and people scattering on the streets of Tehran, before moving to dramatised evocations of Anvari\u2019s earliest memories.</p> <p>\u201cThe war was largely invisible to us, because Tehran wasn\u2019t the frontline,\u201d Anvari says. \u201cWe were children, and we didn\u2019t really know what was happening. But I remember sirens wailing and running with my neighbours into the basement of the apartment block. I remember the arguments and rumours that would circulate down there, hearing these distant blasts of Iraqi missiles.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0e6e7e76281ef128c5cea764c2210296b40b191\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0e6e7e76281ef128c5cea764c2210296b40b191/93_6_1720_1033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avin Manshadi as Dorsa in Under the Shadow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avin Manshadi as Dorsa in Under the Shadow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His heroine is Shideh, played by Narges Rashidi, a doctor who has been banned for political activism. When her husband is called to the frontline, Shideh is left in the apartment with their daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi). She angrily works out to an illegal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jane-fonda\">Jane Fonda</a> aerobics tape, her resentment building towards her husband and the revolutionary guard that patrol the streets. Then a missile tears through the upper floor of the apartment block, leaving deep, dark cracks in the ceiling of their living room.</p> <p>Like Chekhov\u2019s gun, the unexploded bomb starts to weigh on the home in multivalent ways. Dorsa becomes sleepless and fevered, sees apparitions in the apartment that seem, to her child\u2019s eyes, potent and real. A superstitious, deeply conservative neighbour warns Shideh of the presence of djinn, the wind-born spirits that haunt places already beset by fear. As the other tenants start to flee the building, Dorsa and Shideh are left to confront a malevolent spirit that may or may not be imagined.</p> <p>Rashidi was also born in Tehran, leaving for Turkey, and then Germany, at the age of seven. Like Anvari, she also has traumatic early memories of the city of her birth.</p> <p>\u201cI was no younger than Avin,\u201d Rashidi says. \u201cI remember falling asleep in the middle of the night in my mum\u2019s lap, and waking up to the sound of bombs falling. We\u2019d be taken down to the cellar to hide, and my mum would always play loud music and start dancing. She would make us stand up and dance with her, so she had her tricks to keep us from being afraid.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I think of the adults in my life at that time, I remember how exhausted they all looked, even as they tried to give us a happy childhood.\u201d</p> <p>Now an actor in Los Angeles, Rashidi found herself re-examining the impact of her own past in order to portray Shideh. \u201cI knew what was going on,\u201d she says of the war. \u201cI was old enough to pick things up. But I never looked into those memories after leaving Tehran. I wanted to try and forget such things \u2013 war and revolution \u2013 so I could get on with my life. I tried to forget, to put it all away. But it was there. I never lost it, I just never dug into it. I had to do that with this movie. I had to go back to that time, and it was difficult.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82746c633b104ae4491961ff7b5b62690e461352\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82746c633b104ae4491961ff7b5b62690e461352/382_20_1664_999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terror above \u2026 Avin Manshadi and Narges Rashidi in Under the Shadow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terror above \u2026 Avin Manshadi and Narges Rashidi in Under the Shadow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all its scare tactics and creeping atmospherics, Under the Shadow is deeply humanist, and seems in awe of the women who were forced to live, and raise children, under the threat of carpet bombs and the intolerance of the post-revolution regime.</p> <p>In one stunning scene, Shideh flees the apartment in terror when the spirit finally reveals itself, only to be arrested by a patrol of uniformed thugs. Her crime, punishable by lashes, is for venturing into the daylight without her chador \u2013 a flowing veil the visiting spirit also seems to wear.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a misconception about Iranian women,\u201d says Anvari. \u201cPeople think of them as oppressed, ready to be victimised. But Iranian women always fight back. There are so many restrictions in Iranian society, but they never sit back and just accept them. Shideh was inspired by my mother, and the other women I knew when I was growing up. Her strength is a tribute to them.\u201d</p> <p>It is rare to find a horror story rooted in the fears our mothers pass on to us, that captures how trauma can, from one generation to the next, visit us in the middle of the night. And how, with strength and resilience, we can spirit it all away.</p> <p><em>Under the Shadow is released in the UK on 30 September. See review, page 23.</em></p>",

How movies see real-life heroes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This anecdote, while reinforcing Wahlberg\u2019s image of the kid from the streets done good, also acts as a reminder of just how long he has been in the public eye, being shuttled around the world first by record companies, then film-makers while pining for the basketball courts back home. It hs been 25 years since he crunched his abs as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO9909uexu8\">Marky Mark with the unforgettably named Funky Bunch</a>. Since then, he has made the tricky crossover from teenage heartthrob to respected actor and producer, and at first glance, Wahlberg now looks like a typical Hollywood A-lister. His gently feathered hair, which brushes his shoulders, looks like it was cut by a stylist who charges three figures, and his deep tan and muscles suggest a man whose time is his own. But Wahlberg has always been a more surprising prospect than appearances suggest. For a start, the reason he seems so bored is because, he says, right off the bat, \u201cI never really like talking about myself,\u201d which is not something you hear often from a celebrity.

Wahlberg plays Mike Williams, the heroic lead character based on a real person, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/kurt-russell\">Kurt Russell</a> as the gruff ol\u2019 boss and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-malkovich\">John Malkovich</a>, who hams it up enjoyably as the BP rep, evil to an almost southern gothic extent. It is a strikingly harrowing disaster film and Wahlberg is in classic Wahlberg mode: the blue-collar hero, standing his ground against, on the one side, Malkovich\u2019s scenery chewing and, on the other, the pyrotechnic special effects.</p> <p>Wahlberg\u2019s career is remarkable in two respects: first, the sheer range of films he has made. There are the intense dramas (The Basketball Diaries, Boogie Nights, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-fighter\">The Fighter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/03/broken-city-review\">Broken City</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/thriller.mattdamon\">The Departed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/14/thriller\">We Own the Night</a>), the comedies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/nov/04/londonfilmfestival2004.londonfilmfestival\">I Heart Huckabees</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/16/the-other-guys-review\">The Other Guys</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ted\">Ted</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/22/date-night-review\">Date Night</a>), the action movies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/transformers-age-of-extinction-review-michael-bay\">Transformers: Age of Extinction</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/30/lone-survivor-review\"> Lone Survivor</a>, Deepwater Horizon).</p> <p>Wahlberg sinks himself so deeply into a role that you can easily forget who you are actually watching, which is not something you can say of most big-name actors (on some level I\u2019d forgotten that the same guy who played Dirk Diggler was also the one who larked around with a talking teddy bear). This relates to the second point about Wahlberg: it is rarely noted how excellent he is at being the calm centre of a movie, often surrounded by flashier performers, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/christianbale\">Christian Bale</a> smoking crack in The Fighter to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jacknicholson\">Jack Nicholson</a> being Jack Nicholson in The Departed to that talking bear in Ted \u2013 and neither competing with them nor being overshadowed.</p> <p>\u201cI just do my thing,\u201d he says, most comfortable with self-deprecation when talking about his acting. But then he loosens up as he switches to producer mode (he produced, among others, The Fighter and Deepwater Horizon): \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the big picture, not my individual experience as an actor. I\u2019ve seen actors who are like: \u2018Oh God, this is my moment,\u2019 and I don\u2019t think it services the movie. You have to put the movie first.\u201d</p> <p>Largely, I suspect, for this reason, Wahlberg has a tendency to be overlooked by critics and accolades, which shine instead upon his co-stars. He was nominated for a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i7tUNXSj7M\">supporting actor Oscar for The Departed</a>, but he was almost completely ignored for The Fighter, even though he\u2019d spent four years training as a boxer for the role; the awards instead went to his co-stars, Bale and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-leo\">Melissa Leo</a>. Does that not bug him?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I come from the real world and you\u2019re only as good as the people around you,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s always been my philosophy. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of my background in sports, but I want the whole team to be good.\u201d</p> <p>It is partly this lack of look-at-me starriness that has helped him retain a relative kind of normality in the eyes of the public, and there is a loose, \u201chey-I\u2019m-just-a-guy\u201d attitude to him in person. Whereas fellow Massachusetts boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mattdamon\">Matt Damon</a> is covered in Hollywood glitter, Wahlberg \u2013 despite being a celebrity for far longer \u2013 still has a coating of grit.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I live in a big house, I drive a fancy car,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I still feel like I\u2019m gonna end up where I came from and as long as I can go there with my head held high and I\u2019m welcomed back with open arms, then I\u2019m OK.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9QoTyPDLuo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y9QoTyPDLuo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click here to watch a trailer for Wahlburgers.</figcaption> </figure>   <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything good happened when I started focusing on my faith.

If you want to see how close this family is then allow me to direct you to their rather extroardinary reality TV show called - what else? - Wahlburgers, which you almost certainly have never watched. Ostensibly made to promote the family\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.wahlburgersrestaurant.com/\">restaurant franchise</a>, Wahlburgers, now in its sixth series, is a rather pleasing antidote to Keeping Up with the Kardashians because, with the exception of the shots of Wahlberg\u2019s LA house \u2013 which is, indeed, big and fancy \u2013 there is little here that\u2019s aspirational. Whereas the Kardashians go shopping on Rodeo Drive, the Wahlberg matriarch, Alma, hunts for bargain shoes at a store called <a href=\"http://www.frugalfannies.com/\">Frugal Fannies</a>. It is more than a little odd to see Wahlberg, an A-lister, on this shonky reality show, but, he says simply: \u201cIt was an opportunity for the family to spend time together.\u201d</p> <p>He talks about his childhood fondly, with his dad, a truck driver, taking him to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/steve-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen</a> movies on weekends. The full picture, however, was more complicated, to put it mildly. Wahlberg was suffering from drug addiction by the age of 13 and, while still a teenager, racially abused a group of black schoolchildren and beat a Vietnamese man with a stick. He also assaulted another Vietnamese man, punching him in the face. He pleaded guilty to assault and battery and served 45 days in prison. He sums up that period of his life as one in which \u201ca lot of things happened and I made a lot of mistakes. But you try to live in the moment and look to the future.\u201d</p> <p>The good thing that came out of it, he says, is that he connected with his Catholicism. \u201cEverybody goes to jail and gets on their hands and knees and says: \u2018Please God, if you get me out I promise I\u2019ll never do it again.\u2019 And of course, by the time you\u2019re out, you fall back into the same habits. But something just kept me wanting to go a little bit more into it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Catholicism is still a major part of his life. He has a daily prayer routine \u201cwhich I absolutely cannot miss\u201d and any movie shooting schedules must accommodate his weekly trip to mass. \u201cEverything good that has happened to me in my life, whether it\u2019s meeting my wife or the births of my children, happened when I started focusing on my faith,\u201d he says. He grins: \u201cI sound like I\u2019m in the recruiting office, don\u2019t I? Here, I\u2019ve got some brochures for you.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019d have to work hard to recruit a New York Jew, I say.</p> <p>\u201cJesus was a Jew,\u201d he replies with mock solemnity, enjoying switching from talking about himself to teasing banter. \u201cI got a lotta New York Jews with me on this trip. Where\u2019s Mr Weinstein? Bring him in! He\u2019s my bubelah!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83f481b6ac3d5d4303500e5054f6d5d5018c9d2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83f481b6ac3d5d4303500e5054f6d5d5018c9d2d/0_0_845_1255/673.jpg\" alt=\"Wahlberg Kate Moss Calvin Klein\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indecent exposure: the 21-year-old Wahlberg poses with a \u201817 or 18\u2019-year-old Kate Moss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Calvin Klein</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if finding religion is a common path trod by ex-cons, the other route Wahlberg took after leaving prison was a little more unusual: he became a hugely successful model. Back in 1992 he posed, in full muscular glory, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlyUuCEEQUc\">Kate Moss for Calvin Klein</a> in one of the most celebrated campaigns of all time. Moss has since said she deeply regretted the shoot. \u201cI had a nervous breakdown when I was 17 or 18, when I had to go and work with Marky Mark,\u201d she <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2012/10/kate-moss-years-of-crying-johnny-depp\">told Vanity Fair in 2012</a>. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like me at all. I felt really bad about straddling this buff guy. I didn\u2019t like it. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed for two weeks. I thought I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>Wahlberg was only 21 with no experience of the fashion world at the time. Did he feel similarly exploited?</p> <p>\u201cWell, for me it was different,\u201d he says. \u201cThe frustration that I felt was that when we talked about doing that, I was doing my music and they were like: \u2018OK, it will be about what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 but then it became just about [the image].</p> <p>\u201cBut you know, I still signed up for it, it was what it was and I think there were pros and cons. And Kate\u2019s had a good career,\u201d he concludes, which seems a tad dismissive of an 18-year-old\u2019s nervous breakdown, but, as Wahlberg says, he is not really one for introspection or reflection.</p> <p>There is a distinct smack of the guy\u2019s guy about Wahlberg, the one who still raves about his mother\u2019s bolognese and keeps his friends from home close. So close that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/17/mark-wahlberg-hustling-entire-life\">two of them are on this trip to London with him</a>. Does he always travel with his buddies? \u201cYeah! They may get fired for a short amount of time but they always come back. We\u2019re not the most professional group,\u201d Wahlberg says proudly. This part of his life was, of course, memorialised in the TV show and film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/21/entourage-film-review-hatefully-unfunny-jeremy-piven-hollywood-satire\">Entourage</a>, which he co-produced (\u201cYou take a swing and hope to hit a home run and sometimes you miss,\u201d is how he sums up the widely panned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/21/entourage-film-review-hatefully-unfunny-jeremy-piven-hollywood-satire\">film</a> version.) But is it difficult when your life is so different from those of your friends that you can fire them?</p> <p>\u201cDifficult?\u201d he repeats, baffled.</p> <p>Yes, isn\u2019t it awkward?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019d have to ask them,\u201d he shoots back, a little grumpily.</p> <p>He pauses for a few seconds: \u201cNo. Look, I think, my real friends are certainly happy for the success I\u2019ve had. But I try to spread and share as much as possible.\u201d</p> <p>On cue, one of his buddies comes back into the room with a salad and a drink for Wahlberg. Any remnants of Wahlberg\u2019s boredom and glumness are gone. Instead, he becomes downright larky.</p> <p>\u201cI have a major issue with adolescent behaviour with my friends,\u201d says the Hollywood mogul, punching his patiently smiling friend in the shoulder, and I realise I am basically in Entourage. And suddenly, Wahlberg surprises me by being so unsurprising.</p> <p><em>Deepwater Horizon is released in the UK on 30 September</em></p>",
  "<p>In the last 25 years, the Jerry Springer Show has delivered more on-air fights, ranting white supremacists, adulterous strippers and transphobia than anything else on television. That might not be such a great achievement but it\u2019s a undeniable phenomenon, a game-changer that turned daytime television into an entirely different, somewhat terrifying place. It inspired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/apr/30/theatre.artsfeatures2\">an opera</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK_25NimbqU\">a feature film</a> and turned its host into a multimillionaire.</p> <p>Believe them or not, here are some of the show\u2019s most outrageous moments over the course of its first quarte- century. May Jerry survive long enough to make it through his second.</p> <p><strong>A Man Marries a Horse</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd1757f5a97fd9f8b33aa7ccacff5517d58f71dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd1757f5a97fd9f8b33aa7ccacff5517d58f71dc/0_0_615_462/500.jpg\" alt=\"horse\" width=\"500\" height=\"376\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Remember when certain conservatives said that allowing gay couples to marry would lead to a man wanting to marry his farm animals? It was already starting to happen before marriage equality was even a twinkle in Neil Patrick Harris\u2019s eye. On one of his more controversial episodes, Jerry talks to a man who lives in wedded bliss with his four-legged friend and thinks that he should be allowed to do anything that makes him happy. That\u2019s hard to disagree with \u2013 except in this instance. <br></p> <p><strong>The Kung Fu Hillbilly</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFaR_QxQ-qk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IFaR_QxQ-qk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>While Jerry is pretty interesting, it\u2019s always the colorful characters that he has on his show that get people to tune in. None is more colorful than David, a self-identified hillbilly who has learned kung fu from watching action movies on his VCR. When it comes time to defend himself from his roommate Lil Wayne (no relation to the rapper, we believe) his karate chops don\u2019t prove as effective as he would imagine.</p> <p><strong>Sex Worker Loses Her Teeth</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ7_Cf0gLKo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tZ7_Cf0gLKo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Sometimes it\u2019s the small moments that really make this show live in the memory. Check out this tiny bit where a woman purporting to be a sex worker gets in a fistfight and manages to loose her dentures in the process. That\u2019s why we love Jerry. He\u2019s always keeping it classy. <strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Mother Daughter Domination</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1Nw-kJcOcw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m1Nw-kJcOcw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The only thing Jerry likes more than the audience shouting his name is telling them about lurid fetishes. Here is a mother daughter dominatrix team, which doesn\u2019t seem that kinky until they bring their slave out on stage and ride him around like a miniature pony. And wait until his wife shows up to browbeat him in front of the crowd. <strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Breaking the Sex Record</strong><br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU6ERZ0Z1bU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MU6ERZ0Z1bU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It seemed crazy when Jerry hosted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3Zi_WQoQqQ\">Annabel Chong</a>, who had sex with 251 men in 10 hours, but then it was even crazier when he had on Jasmin St Clair, who had sex with 300 guys to break the record of her own.

Just this year Judah came out and did a very flamboyant dance for his best friend, rapped about his feelings for him, and proposed marriage. When the crowd is expecting his strait-laced friend to freak out, he instead accepts and starts making out with Judah on stage.

  "<p>The representation of US presidents on film has had a patchy history, recently. Oliver Stone put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/04/oliver.stone.george.bush\">George W Bush on screen in W</a>, and Tricky Dicky is almost a rite-of-passage for male American character actors, like Richard III for Shakespearian Brits: there have been scowly-jowly turns from Frank Langella, Kevin Spacey and John Cusack. Throughout the 1990s, though, we saw a different phenomenon \u2013 the quasi-Clinton fictional president, a mature yet credibly foxy C-in-C inspired by Bill, like Michael Douglas in The American President, Bill Pullman in Independence Day, Harrison Ford in Air Force One and more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/obama-legacy-biopic-film-southside-with-you\">'History will be kind to him': Obama biopic bodes well for president's legacy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Until now, there\u2019s been nothing inspired by Barack Obama.

But now writer-director Richard Tanne has addressed this with a gently likable, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-linklater\">Linklaterish</a> movie that ideologically conflates romantic excitement with progressive idealism, bringing in some unexpected subtleties.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRssm7V5-VE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eRssm7V5-VE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s all about Barack and Michelle\u2019s first date in the summer of 1989, when the future president met his (do I mean \u201cher\u201d?) future spouse in Chicago. This date took in an art gallery, sandwiches in the park, a political meeting and a trip to the movies \u2013 culminating in the legendary first kiss on a bench outside the Baskin-Robbins ice cream store, now commemorated by a plaque.</p> <p>Parker Sawyers is an eerily close likeness for the lanky, conceited, cigarette-smoking young Barack, a Harvard law student doing a summer associate programme at the prestigious a Chicago firm where he is mentored by beautiful, smart Michelle, played with charm and self-possession by Tika Sumpter.</p> <p>Tanne has taken the accepted version of events and imagined the dialogue, ingeniously crafting a traditional romance within a walking-pace, real-time narrative, complete with meet-cute, breakup and makeup. Michelle is unimpressed by Barack\u2019s swagger, disconcerted by the hole in the floor of his old car \u2013 and not exactly enamoured by the cigarettes he is smoking, though doesn\u2019t mention it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"827e6bd66b192dd5fedb5c9660da647afb8dfb64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/827e6bd66b192dd5fedb5c9660da647afb8dfb64/350_0_426_533/400.jpg\" alt=\"The road to the White House starts here \u2026 Southside With You\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The road to the White House starts here \u2026 Southside With You</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They talk about Michelle\u2019s hard-working idealistic parents, about Barack\u2019s troubled background and his drunk dad. Tanne imagines a later scene in a bar where she challenges him directly on not facing up to his emotions. They talk about their ambitions and Barack irritates her with a misjudged, patronising homily about how she\u2019s obviously not fulfilled at work. One subject they do not discuss is whether a woman should give up her career to be a wife and mom.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Michelle and Barack wouldn\u2019t be the first couple who revealed most about themselves on the first date</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If these people were fictional characters, they would almost certainly have an encounter with white racists, from which they would emerge shaken but determined, and brought closer together by the trauma. Not here. But on this point, Southside With You becomes interestingly, almost meta-textually sophisticated. Barack and Michelle do indeed encounter racism \u2013 on the movie screen. He takes her to see Spike Lee\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/do-the-right-thing\">Do the Right Thing</a> (again, this really happened, encouraged by a rave review from celebrated Chicago critic Roger Ebert), where they watch the brutality of bigoted cops. Then out in the lobby, while Barack is in the men\u2019s room, Michelle is quietly mortified to run into her (white) bosses, who she fears will think the less of her professional credentials, in apparently going on some simpering date with a co-worker.</p> <p>When Barack returns, a tense four-way conversation begins, and Barack smoothly finesses this boss\u2019s objection to the violence that concludes the film, suggesting that it was a safety valve and that the aggressor would have anticipated the existence of an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d to minimise damage. That cleverly imagined scene puts on show Obama\u2019s political acumen, diplomacy and instinct for negotiating with the white world. And it demonstrates all the nuances of race, class, gender politics and professional prestige far more interestingly and effectively than the usual \u201cracism\u201d moment.</p> <p>Did it all happen just like that? Well, of course not. It is all a bit too good to be true and there are times when Southside With You has a TV movie feel. Tanne\u2019s dramatic licence means bringing in years of conversation and hindsight and compressing them into a few hours \u2013 but interestingly, perhaps it is closer to the truth than first appears. Michelle and Barack wouldn\u2019t be the first couple who revealed most about themselves on the first date, before coupledom and marriage made them invisible to each other.</p>",
  "<p>The UK will be hauled before the European court of justice for failing to provide safe habitats for harbour porpoises, the European commission said on Thursday. </p> <p>Harbour porpoises resemble bottlenose dolphins, with small rounded heads, flat foreheads and a black-lipped mouth that curves upwards, as if smiling.</p> <p>The mammals are endemic to the North Atlantic, but their numbers have been falling in the Baltic, Mediterranean and the east of the English Channel.</p> <p>Mortalities from fishing net accidents in areas such as the Celtic Sea, west of Cornwall, have <a href=\"http://seawatchfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Harbour_Porpoise.pdf\">cast doubt on the species\u2019 sustainability</a>, and the commission has awarded them an \u201cunfavourable\u201d conservation status.</p> <p>Under EU law, the UK should have drawn up a list of conservation areas for the porpoises, but has so far formally proposed just one small site in the Skerries and Causeway conservation area, in Northern Ireland.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-37466649\">A second \u201cspecial area of conservation\u201d was created</a> in the Inner Hebrides and Minches last weekend <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-35362640\">after warnings</a> from conservationists that Scotland was lagging in conservation efforts.</p> <p>Lyndsey Dodds, WWF\u2019s head of marine policy, said: \u201cThe UK has so far failed to designate enough protected areas for these charismatic, intelligent and highly social marine mammals, despite the requirement to do so under the EU habitats directive. </p> <p>\u201cWe welcome the recent proposal to designate the Hebrides and Minches protected area but more needs to be done to ensure there is a coherent network of sites and to ensure they are properly managed.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>The commission noted the move in the Hebrides and Minches, but said: \u201cThe [UK\u2019s] continued failure to propose and designate sufficient sites leaves the areas where the species occurs in greatest densities without the protection required.\u201d</p> <p> Potential damage to porpoises from offshore windfarm construction, oil and gas exploration and fishing, has not been adequately assessed, the commission judged. </p> <p>At loud levels, underwater noise can injure or even kill porpoises, but it is more likely to lead them to abandon an area. </p> <p> A WWF report on Friday will say that an eight decibel reduction in noise from offshore windfarms \u2013 by means such as \u201cbubble curtains\u201d \u2013 could cut the chance of porpoise population declines by 96% .</p> <p> Earlier this year, the government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/blue-belt-extended-to-protect-8000-square-miles-of-uk-waters\">designated 23 new areas</a> as marine conservation zones, in an extension of a claimed \u201cblue belt\u201d across one-fifth of the UK\u2019s waters. </p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to protecting our marine environment, which includes appropriate protection for harbour porpoise.That is why we already have two Special Areas of Conservation for this important species, and earlier this year consulted on another five possible sites.\u201d</p> <p> The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) argues that it is difficult to identify suitable habitats for the porpoises, but this is disputed by conservationists. </p> <p>Melissa Moore, the policy chief at the Marine Conservation Society said: \u201cThere are large areas where you have harbour porpoises feeding and breeding in which protected sites need to be established. The UK has consulted and should be in the process of designating them.\u201d</p> <p> </p>",

His performance of Liszt\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n04GkRTC_Lo\">Sonata in B minor</a> may not be as grandly impassioned or mercurial of mood as some, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/03/musical-athletes-cheltenham-melyvn-tan\">Tan</a>\u2019s performance, full of long, graded crescendos and with a convincing large-scale shape, is finely judged and ultimately very persuasive. This follows two works by Liszt\u2019s teacher Czerny, better known as a composer of acres of gruelling studies: Variations on a Theme by Rode, and a funeral march for his own teacher, Beethoven. <a href=\"http://www.onyxclassics.com/cddetail.php?CatalogueNumber=ONYX4156\">Beginning it all</a> are the six <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75i53JScg14\">Op 126 Bagatelles</a>, Beethoven\u2019s last works for solo piano, and a gentle, slightly reticent performance of the Sonata Op 109, the unconventional proportions and rhapsodic style of which make it a good counterweight for the Liszt.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrOEQtdtD6o\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KrOEQtdtD6o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch trailer video for Melvyn Tan: Master and Pupil</figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>More than four in five primary school pupils in England passed the government\u2019s check on reading and pronunciation for the first time, although figures showed wide gaps in attainment between pupils based on economic disadvantage and month of birth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/25/phonics-method-helps-close-attainment-gap-study-finds\">Phonics method helps close attainment gap, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Results from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/phonics-screening-check-and-key-stage-1-assessments-england-2016\">2016 phonics check</a>, carried out on five- and six year-olds in year one of primary school, showed 81% met the expected standard, a jump of four percentage points compared with 2015 and a 23 percentage point improvement on the 58% pass rate in 2012, when the test was introduced.</p> <p>The phonics check requires pupils to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phonics-screening-check-2016-materials\">correctly pronounce a list of 40 words and sounds</a>. It was introduced to reinforce the Department for Education\u2019s (DfE) adoption of synthetic phonics as the mandatory technique for teaching the first stages of literacy, known as decoding.</p> <p>Nick Gibb, the schools minister, hailed the result as \u201cfundamental\u201d to improving reading in England. \u201cThanks to the hard work of teachers, our continued focus on raising standards and our increased emphasis on phonics\u200e, there are now an additional 147,000 six-year-olds on track to becoming fluent readers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile this is a huge achievement, we know there is more to do. We will work with schools and local authorities to ensure even more young people have the knowledge and skills they need to get on in life.\u201d</p> <p>The figures were published alongside the first results of teacher assessments carried out at the end of key stage one \u2013 year two in primary school \u2013 showing three in four pupils meeting the tougher standards introduced this year in reading and maths, but just 65% achieving the same in writing.</p> <p>The DfE\u2019s statisticians said that because the reformed teacher assessments involved a new, higher standard, they were not comparable to key stage one results from previous year.</p> <p>The phonics check and the key stage one assessments showed considerable variations in attainment, with boys in most cases lagging behind girls, and children from disadvantaged backgrounds \u2013 especially those recorded as white British \u2013 well behind their better-off peers.</p> <p>\u201cThe data shows attainment gaps remain a challenge. More girls than boys continue to meet the phonics standard but this gap is decreasing, the gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and all other pupils has narrowed again, which is welcome,\u201d said Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers.</p> <p>But Hobby noted that the attainment gap between special needs pupils and others had not changed.<br></p> <p>The figures also showed schools in inner London outperforming most of the rest of the country, especially in writing at the end of key stage one.</p> <p>The data showed 73% of pupils in inner London schools reached the expected standard in writing, compared with 65% in state schools in England as a whole. The same London areas also got the best pass rates in reading and maths.</p> <p>Outside London, the north-east region \u2013 including Northumberland, Middlesbrough and Redcar \u2013 was the best performer, with the highest proportion of children meeting expectations in reading, writing and maths.</p> <p>The new system of teacher assessments \u2013 which replaced national levels \u2013 revealed sharp ethnic and gender divides. Just 58% of white boys reached the expected level in writing, while 72% of white girls did so.<br></p> <p>Data from phonics checks also showed stark differences in results based on month of birth. Among year one pupils, those born in September, at the start of the school year, had a 87% pass rate, compared with those born in August, who had a 72% pass rate.</p> <p>The gap was more pronounced when gender and birth month were combined. Nine out of 10 girls born in September passed the phonics check, while about seven in 10 boys born in August managed to do the same.</p>",

  "<p>Racing\u2019s disciplinary system is to be separated from the sport\u2019s ruling body as part of changes recommended by the Quinlan review, published on Thursday. Christopher Quinlan QC, hired to give an independent overview of the system which has attracted so much criticism this year, concludes in a 151-page document that the current set-up is broadly fair but makes 24 recommendations for change, all of which have been immediately accepted by the British Horseracing Authority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/27/british-horseracing-authority-bha-publish-quinlan-review-disciplinary-process\">BHA commits to publishing Quinlan review of disciplinary panel process</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Quinlan declines to say anything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/28/jim-best-high-court-ruling-rehearing-bha\">about the vexed Jim Best case</a>, which created the need for his review to be accelerated. A finding against Best was quashed in May because of an appearance of bias and insufficiency in the published reasons, with the result that the case will be reheard in November. As the case remains live, Quinlan says it would be inappropriate for him to investigate it.</p> <p>His main area of concern is racing\u2019s disciplinary panel, which, he says, \u201chas not evolved sufficiently with modern and best practice. That is not through malice or ill will or bad faith on the part of anyone\u201d.</p> <p>A BHA director, currently Jamie Stier, has been responsible for running the panel and appointing its members but that is to change. Under the new system, the panel is to be run by a \u201cjudicial panel chairman\u201d who is to be a senior legal practitioner, independent of the BHA, with in-depth knowledge of the sport.</p> <p>He is to preside over an expanded pool of people who can be called upon to make up disciplinary panels, to be doubled in size to 22, including more lawyers but excluding those who also work as raceday stewards. Those stewards have accounted for at least two-thirds of all panels under the existing system but Quinlan rules that \u201cto remove them would enhance confidence in the process \u2026 by addressing the concern that active stewards adjudicating upon the decisions of stewards with whom they have officiated is unfair\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, Quinlan urges broadening membership of the panel, perhaps to include former trainers or jockeys, or veterinary surgeons. He adds that it would be desirable for an experienced lawyer to chair every inquiry, rather than just the more complex cases, as happens now.</p> <p>Quinlan appears stunned at the informality of the system for appointments to the disciplinary panel. \u201cIt might be said to be organic,\u201d he notes, the closest he ever comes to being scathing. \u201cInsofar as there is a procedure, it is not set down in the rules or elsewhere. Plainly it is not transparent.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/06/rehearing-bha-case-against-trainer-jim-best-delayed-further\">Rehearing of BHA case against trainer Jim Best delayed further</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He recommends that the appointments procedure be formalised and opened up to competition against published criteria. He sets down time limits for publication of verdicts and clarifies the situations in which the BHA must disclose documentation to the defence. There is to be a fast-track system for minor offences and pro bono advice for those who cannot afford their own defence.</p> <p>Quinlan also tackles the disciplinary panel meetings which have been the subject of some suspicion, as they amount to regular meetings between those who act as judges and prosecutors in BHA cases, with others excluded and no minutes published. While he stops short of insisting on opening those up to external scrutiny, he offers stern counsel about what can be discussed.</p> <p>\u201cIt should not be a vehicle by which the regulator or the defence comments upon the correctness or otherwise of the decisions,\u201d Quinlan says. \u201cNor should it be one in which the regulator or the defence are able to make submissions on, for example, the meaning of the rules or of policies.\u201d</p> <p>BHA officials have welcomed Quinlan\u2019s review and expressed the hope that a judicial panel chairman might be appointed by the end of the year, in time to appoint the rest of the newly expanded panel by the end of March. Simultaneously, the authority announced a reshuffle of responsibility among its senior personnel so that the duties of Adam Brickell, the recently departed integrity director, are absorbed by his former colleagues.</p> <p>Nick Rust, the BHA chief executive, said: \u201cThe changes we are making mean that everyone connected with our sport will be able to have the utmost confidence in the impartiality and fairness of the BHA\u2019s disciplinary panels. As well as providing his own expert, independent view, Christopher Quinlan\u2019s report has given us the opportunity to address the concerns of our sport\u2019s participants and stakeholders and to improve their confidence in what we do and how we do it.\u201d</p> <p>The review was also welcomed by Paul Struthers, chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, who has been advocating changes to the existing system for years. \u201cWhilst we have never accused the disciplinary panel of, nor believed its members were, biased, we believed that the perception or feeling of such bias existed for various reasons,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important that these recommendations, along with those outstanding from the previous integrity review, are implemented in full and it is to the credit of the BHA board that they have all been accepted and will be implemented within a six- to eight-month time frame, which in our view is reasonable, given their scope. This needs to be done in a way that is collegiate and has the involvement and buy-in of relevant stakeholders.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also important that this is complemented by a continued culture shift as already advocated and demonstrated by Nick Rust. Both elements are equally crucial to a fairer system that remains robust and to regaining the full confidence of participants and the public alike in the BHA\u2019s disciplinary and integrity processes.\u201d</p> <p>Rupert Arnold, chief executive of the National Trainers Federation, was also encouraged by the review. \u201cWe believe trainers will welcome Christopher Quinlan QC\u2019s recommendations,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cHis finding that, viewed in totality, the BHA provides a fair disciplinary system is important as it clarifies any doubts that some may have had. That in itself engenders confidence.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, more significantly, the BHA\u2019s confirmation that it will adopt all the report\u2019s recommendations for further strengthening of the disciplinary structure, making it structurally independent of the BHA means trainers will be confident that when they face a disciplinary panel, it meets the highest standards of modern sports regulation.</p> <p>\u201cAnother positive aspect of the report is the recommendation to broaden membership of the panels to include suitably qualified people with racing knowledge. This will create a deeper sense that disciplinary decisions are made with appropriate understanding of the evidence.</p> <p>\u201cCombining the licensing and disciplinary panels makes sense, though we have some concerns that applicants for a licence do not currently have more timely access to an independent assessment of their case. This could be dealt with using similar protocols to those that have been recommended for disciplinary cases in the BHA\u2019s Integrity Review carried out earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cFinally, in relation to the changes to the BHA Executive team, we are particularly pleased at the news that a new role of director of equine health and welfare is to be created. Equine welfare is a primary objective in our sport; this position gives it the standing it deserves in the governance of racing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The secret of why dogs are man\u2019s best friend could be lurking in their genes, according to new research.</p> <p>Scientists say they have found a handful of genes that appear to be linked to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/02/dogs-are-twice-as-friendly-to-humankind-as-previously-thought-suggests-study\">tendency for dogs to seek human help and contact</a>. </p> <p>\u201c[Our aim] is to try to understand the genetic underpinnings of domestication: what is it that has helped to turn the wolf, which is really not interested in humans to start off with, into this extremely sociable creature which is the dog?\u201d said Per Jensen, co-author of the research from Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden. \u201cWe think we have at least found some of the genetic background of this process.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/srep33439\">Scientific Reports</a>, the scientists describe how they sought to probe the genetics behind canine behaviour by enlisting the help of 437 beagles bred and raised in laboratory conditions.</p> <p>Each dog was placed in a room with a researcher they did not know and presented with the same task. <br></p> <p>Three transparent, sliding plastic lids, each covering a treat, were presented to each dog. However, one of the lids was fixed and could not be moved, no matter how much the dog pawed it or pushed it with its nose. </p> <p>\u201cWe know that wolves don\u2019t seek help, they will attempt to solve the problem on their own, and some dogs actually do that - they just keep going and trying to open this lid,\u201d said Jensen. \u201cBut the most common reaction is at some point to turn to the human.\u201d</p> <p>Each dog was given three minutes to retrieve the treats, with their behaviour recorded on video and scored for the frequency and duration of various behaviours , such as jumping up at the researcher or making eye contact. </p> <p>The 95 dogs with the top scores and the 95 with the bottom scores for social interactions were then selected, and DNA samples taken. Their genomes were then analysed and compared in what is known as a genome wide association study, with variations across the genome checked for an association with scores for specific behaviours, such as the duration for which dog was in physical contact with the researcher. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The results revealed variations within two genomic regions that appear to be linked with a canine yen for human contact, within which five genes were identified as being the most likely to be associated with the behaviour. </p> <p>But, Jensen admits, it is unlikely to be the full picture. \u201cThere are probably plenty of genes interacting with these five,\u201d he said, adding that it is also unknown exactly how the five genes might be influencing doggy sociability. The team are now looking to see if the same results can be found in other breeds of dog, including Labrador retrievers. </p> <p>The authors also reveal that four of the five genes have previously been associated with an increased risk of a range social disorders in humans, including autism.</p> <p>\u201cOf course we do not know any mechanisms or anything like that, so we can\u2019t say anything about whether or not these mechanisms will be similar in dogs,\u201d said Jensen. </p> <p>While the new study offers some clues to doggy sociability the authors caution that there are other factors at play.</p> <p>\u201cWe also know that the genetic contribution to this variation is only about 30%, so 70% of the variation has to do with things like experience,\u201d said Jensen. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Eleanor Raffan, a researcher in canine genetics from the University of Cambridge, said that the research provides some hints about which genes might influence doggy sociability towards humans, but that the study focused on only certain types of behaviour and, given the complexity of the trait, tens or hundreds of genes might all be playing a small role.</p> <p>\u201cEven if one or more of the five genes identified do exert an effect, it\u2019s likely only a small part of the story,\u201d she said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Because their store caters to both patients and potheads, they\u2019ve also had to navigate the rules on the potency and amount of marijuana they\u2019re allowed to sell, depending on whether it\u2019s medical, edible or recreational.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/charlo-greene-alaska-cannabis-club-reporter-marijuana\">Reporter who quit on air to fight for pot legalization could face decades in prison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d said Brooke Smith. \u201cOur personal finances are all screwed up; our credit cards are maxed ... We love what we do, but it definitely hasn\u2019t been a cakewalk.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Smiths joined the Oregon Cannabis Business Council to seek guidance on the process, but they say they\u2019re the only African American members. Brooke participates in a number of cannabis organizations and has never run into another African American who owns a marijuana-related business. She only knows of one other dispensary in Portland that is black-owned. The reason for the scarcity, she said, has to do with education and missed opportunity. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe reality today is that we\u2019re not well educated on how to handle our personal finances,\u201d said Smith, who used to work as an insurance agent before moving into marijuana. \u201cOur parents didn\u2019t pass this down to their kids, so we\u2019ve had to figure it out without a lot of support and backing.\u201d<br></p> <p>The legal marijuana trade is booming in Oregon. The government has collected more than <a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/news/local/marijuana/oregon-collects-25-million-in-2016-pot-tax-revenue/305145418\">$25m in sales taxes so far in 2016, according to the state\u2019s Department of Revenue</a>. With a 25% tax on the stuff, that translates to more than $100m-worth of weed sold so far. But a range of cultural, educational and legal barriers may have kept minorities from cashing in.<br></p> <p>Support for minorities who want to enter the budding trade could come in the form of a new 3% sales tax on recreational weed in Portland, a ballot measure that will be voted on in November. Oregon will tax marijuana at 17% starting in January, and the additional 3% tax aims, in part, to help people of color in launching their own innovative small businesses.</p> <p>The Portland lawmakers behind the bill project that the additional tax could bring in at least $3m per year, part of which would go toward assisting neighborhood minority-owned businesses of any type, in the form of incubator programs, management and job training and financial support. The accrued tax revenue would also be funneled into drug and alcohol education and treatment programs, public safety investments and supporting women-owned businesses. Finally, a portion would go toward a grant program for people who want to expunge past marijuana-related charges from their criminal records but who can\u2019t afford the hefty legal fees involved.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a myriad of things in that legislation that can help our communities of color,\u201d said Jesce Horton, the Portland-based owner of both a cannabis cultivation facility and a line of gourmet edibles who co-founded the nonprofit Minority Cannabis Business Association (MCBA) last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s really about us making sure we come together and apply for those funds, and put ourselves in a position to take advantage.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa88b1c4455bfdb7df7f31b372baec6091d7040\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa88b1c4455bfdb7df7f31b372baec6091d7040/0_49_2182_1309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minority Cannabis Business Association vice chair Jeannette Ward, left, with a man named Jacob, right, who got his record expunged of marijuana charges in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minority Cannabis Business Association vice chair Jeannette Ward, left, with a man named Jacob, right, who got his record expunged of marijuana charges in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MCBA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Horton\u2019s group wants to help Portland\u2019s people of color benefit from the tax funding by encouraging them to enter the weed business. But he recognizes that it could be an uphill climb for some. As a 1,000-member nationwide organization, only 10% of MCBA members actually work in the cannabis industry, according to Horton. Most are trying to find a way in. And in Portland, Horton only knows a few African Americans who are proprietors of pot.<br></p> <p>In the absence of hard data on minorities in the legal weed market \u2013 one of the few available estimates <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/03/18/471008253/as-the-legal-pot-industry-booms-african-americans-are-left-behind\">pegs minority involvement in dispensaries at 1%</a> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/03/18/471008253/as-the-legal-pot-industry-booms-african-americans-are-left-behind\">nationwide</a> \u2013 the MCBA is currently working on a study with the University of California, Berkeley on the demographics of the cannabis industry.<br></p> <p>But Horton, who helped Portland commissioner Amanda Fritz draft the language of the proposed 3% tax, believes the lack of people of color in legalized marijuana has to do with heavy regulation, barriers to accessing capital and gaps in the right information.<br></p> <p>Furthermore, among minorities in Portland, working in legalized cannabis comes with its fair share of taboo. \u201cPeople are a little bit scared of jumping into the industry first and knowing that, looking at statistics, they may be the first to get arrested or they may be putting themselves or their families in jeopardy,\u201d Horton said.<br></p> <p>Black people are <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/new-aclu-report-finds-overwhelming-racial-bias-marijuana-arrests\">3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people</a>, despite comparable usage rates, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). And the decriminalization of marijuana may not do much to change the imbalance. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2829054-2016-SB13-283-Rpt-Colorado-Early-Findings-in.html\">Colorado Department of Public Safety revealed</a> that, shortly before marijuana was legalized there in 2014, the number of white teenagers arrested on marijuana charges in the state decreased by 8% between 2012 and 2014, the most recent years for which data is available. Yet for black teens, the arrests increased by 58%, and for Hispanics by 29% during the same period.<br></p> <p>The ACLU of Oregon said that while it doesn\u2019t yet have statewide numbers on marijuana arrests or citations since legalization in July 2015, it\u2019s interested in learning whether Oregon will follow Colorado with a persistent racial disparity in marijuana violations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbbaeb3253e825ec503ebd13d715568f3c41b2ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbbaeb3253e825ec503ebd13d715568f3c41b2ac/0_0_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tree PDX, the Smiths\u2019 Portland dispensary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tree PDX, the Smiths\u2019 Portland dispensary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brooke Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy guess is we will see something similar here, as there\u2019s evidence that racial disparities exist across the criminal justice system, and marijuana legalization won\u2019t correct that larger issue,\u201d said Sarah Armstrong, communications and outreach director of the ACLU of Oregon.<br></p> <p>While marijuana is now legal in designated quantities in these states, many past offenders still have cannabis convictions tainting their records, ultimately road-blocking them from moving on with their lives.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere are an awful lot of people with marijuana offenses that are struggling because they have that on the books,\u201d said Oregon state Representative Lew Frederick, who in 2015 proposed legislation that would allow a person to submit a request to have his or her record cleared of a marijuana possession. \u201cThey then get can\u2019t jobs, they can\u2019t get houses or education, they can\u2019t apply for business loans,\u201d he said.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/colombia-cannabis-growers-legalisation\">Colombia's clandestine cannabis growers keen to come out of the shadows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s something that Fritz hopes Portland\u2019s proposed marijuana tax can abate through a grant program for those who need assistance paying the $1,000 or more in legal fees it can cost to expunge the past cannabis charges from their records.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy understanding is that when the ballot measure passes, it will be the first in the nation to designate some of the money to correct past inequitable actions in the criminal justice system,\u201d said Fritz.<br></p> <p>Donald Morse, director of the Oregon Cannabis Business Council, said he\u2019s all too familiar with the drill of expungement. He\u2019s still dealing with his own record after a raid of his dispensary back in 2012, when authorities accused him of selling pot for recreational use, a practice that was then illegal.

  "<p>No wonder scholars love 18th-century British gardens.

Plants were the least of it. Proprietors seem to have indulged a kind of semiotic frenzy, so historians can discover in their garden whimsies the pleasures and fantasies of rich Georgians.</p> <p>Kate Felus has written an enjoyable anecdotal account of what Georgians did in their gardens: walking, sailing (if you had a decent lake), fishing, reading, enjoying amorous assignations, playing with telescopes and camera obscuras, practising archery, singing, dressing up or, if your grounds were spacious enough, just circling around in your carriage. Really, this is a book about the history of pleasure. Its arrangement is not, therefore, conventionally chronological.

The rural ritual of haymaking became particularly attractive, so much so that some genteel ladies began to participate in it. In an attempt to allure the young and still unmarried George III, Lady Sarah Lennox, dressed in suitable rustic garb, used to toss the hay in a field next to the road where he took his daily ride. Eighteenth-century paintings show the nouveau riche angling <em>en famille</em> in their carefully stocked lakes and ponds, or simply posing, rod in hand, in group paintings known as conversation pieces. Really wealthy landowners built pavilions over the water, from which they and their guests could fish.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Eighteenth-century paintings show the nouveau riche angling en famille in their carefully stocked lakes and ponds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gardens were for showing off. Some aristocrats staged <em>naumachia</em> \u2013 mock naval battles \u2013 on their rural lakes, a fashionable fad in an age of British naval victories. Others set up gun batteries and forts around theirs, re-enacting the triumphs of British arms over the French in the seven years war. Some royals led fashion. George II\u2019s wife, Queen Caroline, hired Kent to design buildings for her garden at Richmond. First there was the Hermitage, a kind of artificial cave for contemplation (though with a fireplace), then there was Merlin\u2019s Cave, a gothic confection with steep thatched roofs where the queen kept her books and sometimes slept.</p> <p>Much of the evidence that Felus uses was designed to celebrate garden pleasures <em>en plein air</em>. The book is cleverly illustrated with some of the paintings and drawings that depict Georgian ladies and gentlemen relishing the landscaped English outdoors. Of course, most of these pictures were paid for by the garden owners and were supposed to celebrate the pleasures they sponsored. In some catty extracts from Walpole\u2019s letters we hear that some of the alfresco entertainments laid on by his aristocratic friends at Stowe were endured rather than enjoyed by guests past the first flush of youth, wrapped in cloaks and greatcoats against the evening chill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4d4165889036dd6a4dccd5a08fa3e5ce229b47b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4d4165889036dd6a4dccd5a08fa3e5ce229b47b/0_0_2622_2025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Secret Life of the Georgian Garden: Beautiful Objects and Agreeable Retreats by Kate Felus.

The naturalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2013/nov/05/natural-history-selborne-gilbert-white-anne-secord-book-review\">Gilbert White</a> at Selborne in Hampshire installed \u201cstatues\u201d in the fields adjoining his limited grounds that were made of painted board. He had a Heath Robinson Hermitage made of woven branches on the top of a nearby hill. There he drank tea or sang with friends, and occasionally had his brother dress up as a hermit, with his guests garbed as shepherds and shepherdesses. The poet William Shenstone made his Shropshire gardens famous with modest expenditure, partly via his poetry. He became skilled in the building of \u201croot houses\u201d, garden buildings made out of materials that grew in the garden (latterday versions are hawked at the Chelsea Flower Show to this day). The idea that a garden was the best place to read and write took hold. In the late 18th century, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/01/my-hero-william-cowper-harris\">William Cowper</a> had a tiny summerhouse in the garden of his Buckinghamshire home where he wrote his poetry.</p> <p>The age of Cowper seems a long way from that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/28/alexander-pope-urn-scuplture-twickenham-memorial\">Alexander Pope</a>, penning his verse about the landscaped idylls of his aristocratic friends as recompense for staying in their houses. Felus has paid a price for her generous historical sweep, where \u201cGeorgian\u201d ranges from the accession of George I in 1714 to the death of William IV in 1837: we sometimes lose a sense of what changed during more than a century.

Leach/Wold may not have played on that particular single but he recorded an album \u2013 Dance Up a Storm \u2013 with them in 1976. The other players in Crystal Grass had a strong pedigree \u2013 Slim Pezin and Don Ray were part of the house band for Tele Music, France\u2019s foremost music library, where French disco king Cerrone also cut his teeth. For disco and breaks fans, Steve Leach\u2019s story has serious kudos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"586a7e2f0ac0948c5f555c17ae8e392af6f0f051\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/586a7e2f0ac0948c5f555c17ae8e392af6f0f051/0_40_1763_2203/800.jpg\" alt=\"Seasick Steve at the Brit Awards 2010.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The man, the myth \u2026 Seasick Steve at the Brit Awards 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s more. At the end of the 70s, he was singing backing vocals for <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/steve-leach-mn0001219744/credits\">Celebration</a>, a Beach Boys splinter group put together by fellow Californian transcendental meditation advocate Mike Love. By 1982 he was a member of the splendidly named Clean Athletic and Talented (or CAT for short), writing and singing on their Woman and Sports album and their awkwardly titled single I Love to Touch Young Girls. CAT\u2019s records appeared on the very cool Dutch disco label Rams Horn. By the late 1980s, he was a producer in Washington State, working with Modest Mouse among others, before he moved to Norway and reinvented himself after a bumpy boat ride. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So, with nothing to be ashamed about creatively, why would anyone be in denial of this career? Partly it might be because, during Steve\u2019s disco years, he looked quite a lot more like Keith Lemon than a member of the Band. More likely, he twigged that people want romance from music. They want to believe someone\u2019s artistic impulses are unfiltered. Seasick Steve got his break <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNoPNC3ebYQ\">singing Dog House Boogie</a> on Jools Holland\u2019s Hootenanny in 2006, bashing his foot on what he called a \u201cMississippi drum machine\u201d, which looked like an old car battery. He sang of \u201cbumming around, living hand to mouth, sometimes goin\u2019 cold and hungry \u2026 tryin\u2019 to get your spare change.\u201d \u201c<em>Yes!</em>\u2019 screamed Jools at the end of the song, with unusual, unguarded enthusiasm, \u201cwith a three string guitar! The genius from Mississippi!\u201d Such a feel-good story. Seasick Steve, he gave hope to the homeless. <br></p> <p>Hindsight\u2019s a fine thing, but it\u2019s hard to imagine how anyone fell for it in the first place. Maybe because he called himself Steve? Seasick Slim would have been a step too far, but Steve \u2013 not exactly a classic bluesman name \u2013 made it more believable. Evidence that Steve\u2019s background wasn\u2019t quite all it seemed has been hidden in plain sight all along. As<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/14/folk\"> Sean O\u2019Hagan noted in an Observer piece</a>, \u201cThe trajectory of his life since [1973] is hazy and, one suspects, he plays down the semi-settled years, sensing correctly that his mainly young audience prefer the myth to the reality\u201d. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMVGzq4-viA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yMVGzq4-viA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Steve admitted to O\u2019Hagan he had stopped wandering in 1973, and had worked in the music business on and off since then, but he was only telling part of the truth: during his supposed wilderness years, Wright says, there had been brushes with Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, among many others, and that he had lived in San Francisco continuously from 1965 to 1972. This was not a man on the margins, but the hobo myth played better to a gullible public. It was clear in interviews that Steve understood why people liked his gutbucket, ultra lo-fi music: \u201cPeople are tired of everything being so fancy. There\u2019s always been fancy music around and complicated shit\u201d he sniffed in an uncomplicated way, and talked of how he dreamed about getting sponsorship from John Deere, or a whisky manufacturer.<br></p> <p>So Seasick Steve is a fictional character. Does it matter, if the music is good?<br></p> <p>In 2008, he told O\u2019Hagan that he didn\u2019t expect his fame to last but he\u2019d like to \u201cmake some real money\u201d while it does. Steve can market himself however he likes, but you have to admit that\u2019s a less charming sentiment coming from a middle-aged man who has been a professional musician his whole life, rather than a self-educated, elderly hard-luck-hobo who says that when he has been settled he has largely worked blue-collar jobs.<br></p> <p>Pop is all about self-invention, but there\u2019s something uncomfortable about Steve\u2019s version of it. Tom Waits\u2019s act is clearly a performance, an exaggeration; he isn\u2019t claiming to be a real alcoholic any more than Gary Numan tried to kid us he was a robot. Seasick Steve\u2019s story is different. When asked what was most important to his songwriting, he said: \u201cThat it\u2019s about something that happened to me, you\u2019re digging up from your own mud. All my memories is like a train waiting to come into the station. It just has to be something real.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s the nub of it. Steve Leach was a session musician; no digging around in his own mud was necessary. He was capable of playing blues, because he could play anything \u2013 that was his job. His unveiling reveals the sense of shame attached to session players, musicians who basically clock in, play, get paid and go home. There shouldn\u2019t be, of course \u2013 great records from Good Vibrations to Unfinished Sympathy couldn\u2019t have existed without session musicians \u2013 but it\u2019s the least romantic job in music, the office job of pop. It suggests the exact opposite of the romantic ideal Steve sought to invoke; a breadhead who can turn their hand to any type of music on a whim.</p> <p>If nothing else, the Seasick Steve saga has taught us one thing \u2013 if you\u2019re going to lie about your age, add 10 years. People will never stop telling you how great you look. <br></p> <ul> <li>Seasick Steve: Ramblin\u2019 Man by Matthew Wright is published by Music Press Books.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>When Americans head to the polling stations and cast their votes on 8 November, they will be asked to decide which candidates for an array of posts \u2013 congressman, senator, judge, city counselor, mayor \u2013 we believe will serve us and represent our best interests. This year\u2019s presidential race presents an interesting question, however. Are we ready to vote for someone who is a professional businessman?</p> <p> On first hearing, that may sound appealing. We\u2019d be getting someone efficient, right? Someone used to doing deals \u2013 someone who insists that the organization they oversee functions smoothly and efficiently, not chaotically and wastefully.</p> <p> But as Monday night\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-analysis\">first presidential debate</a> between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump reminded us, in electing the latter, we\u2019d be getting a businessman, but one who appears to possess a very distinct set of ideas about what being a businessman means and whose interests take priority. Perhaps what motivates Trump the businessman may not make him a wonderful president after all.</p> <p> The first hint came relatively early on in Monday\u2019s debate, when Clinton reminded the audience that Trump had been hoping for the housing market to collapse and that he had said in 2006 that he wished it would break down so that he could go and buy some properties and make some money.</p> <p> \u201cThat\u2019s called business, by the way,\u201d Trump interjected, defending himself.</p> <p> \u201cNine million people lost their jobs,\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cFive million people lost their homes. And $13tn in family wealth was wiped out.\u201d </p> <p> What she left unsaid, and didn\u2019t need to say, was that that was the price of Trump\u2019s \u201cbusiness\u201d opportunity. Nor did Trump feel the need to defend himself from the implicit suggestion that he was indifferent to the connection between pain for the ordinary American citizen \u2013 pain that has amounted to a kind of national trauma that has contributed to his support \u2013 anywhere else in the evening. He left many viewers with a clear sense that \u201cbusiness is business\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trump-trade-blows-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54q33\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754975\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea1adfe4b0a785ec48bdc4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926wrap_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926wrap.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160926wrap_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trump-trade-blows-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p> Indeed, late in the evening, he came right out and said as much. \u201cMy obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p> <p> Trump\u2019s order of priorities is clear. He and his family come first, then his employees, and then his companies. His country? Any not-for-profit causes that are close to his heart? In that statement, he showed the same tone-deafness that was on display when he equated his sacrifice of time and money building his company and amassing wealth to that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son, Capt <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Humayun Khan</a>, was killed in Iraq.

There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once,\u201d Clinton challenged Trump. </p> <p> For his part, Trump can\u2019t even agree with Clinton on the number of bankruptcies (he appears <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/27/fact-checking-the-first-clinton-trump-presidential-debate/\">to consider three separate bankruptcies as a single event</a>, according to debate fact-checkers), and shrugged the whole discussion off as a tempest in a teapot anyway. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-plaza-bankruptcy\">Trump and Atlantic City: the lessons behind the demise of his casino empire</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The bankruptcy laws exist for a purpose, he noted. If you don\u2019t like the laws \u2013 well, change them. \u201cWe used certain laws that are there,\u201d he said. \u201cI take advantage of the laws of the nation because I\u2019m running a company.\u201d And, you know, his obligation isn\u2019t to keep paying his business creditors until he has no more money left at all in his bank account and he\u2019s on the street, if there is a law that enables him to put that business into bankruptcy. Which, of course, there is. And that he has used on six occasions between 1990 and 2009. </p> <p> Trump also bragged about being ahead of schedule and under budget. Part of the reason that the country\u2019s own budget is in dire shape, he suggested, is that \u201cwe have people who have no idea as to what to do and how to buy\u201d. He dismissed out of hand Clinton\u2019s suggestions that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-bills-specialrepor-idUSKCN0T214Q20151113\">he tramples on small vendors</a>. \u201cThey did get paid a lot,\u201d he insisted, but also hinted they took advantage of the laws of the nation, too, in some unspecified way. An architect who designed a clubhouse at one of Trump\u2019s golf courses that Clinton said was immediately put into use? \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhich our country should do, too,\u201d he added, referring to the refusal to pay the amount owed for the work. </p> <p> Do we want a president who picks and chooses which bills to pay?</p> <p> Of course, for many of those watching the debate, the moment that the businessman-like approach by Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-lean-toward-clinton-among-one-group-of-undecided-north-carolina-voters/2016/09/27/ff271b2e-8469-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html?tid=hybrid_collaborative_3_na\">caused their jaws to drop</a> was during the discussion of his personal taxes. </p> <p> Trump has said repeatedly that he plans to break with a 40-year tradition of presidential candidates and won\u2019t release his tax returns while he\u2019s being audited.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/-trump-tax-returns-video-clinton-presidential-debate\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54py9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754738\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton corners Trump over refusal to release tax returns \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e9f924e4b0a785ec48bd68\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926taxes2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926taxes2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11903794&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/-trump-tax-returns-video-clinton-presidential-debate\">Clinton corners Trump over refusal to release tax returns</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p> Translation: unless he changes his mind, we won\u2019t be seeing those documents, with all the information they would provide about his actual income and its sources, his cash donations to charity (as opposed to simply donations of rounds of golf at his courses) and, of course, what percentage of his income actually is paid in taxes.</p> <p> Leaving those questions unanswered left Clinton free to speculate on Monday evening. Maybe, she wondered, Trump isn\u2019t as rich as he\u2019d like us to believe; maybe he isn\u2019t as charitable as he\u2019d like us to think he is. In both cases, there has been plenty of media coverage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/trump-foundation-charity-settle-legal-disputes-reporting\">most recently about the Trump Foundation</a>. Or perhaps, Clinton suggested, he is trying to cover up the fact that he has paid almost nothing in federal income tax. </p> <p> \u201cIf he\u2019s paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for health,\u201d she added.</p> <p> \u201cThat makes me smart,\u201d said Trump, responding as businessman, and a goaded businessman. He went on to claim that \u201cI have a tremendous income.\u201d</p> <p> Later, Trump argued that a businessman like himself was needed to take the lead to solve the country\u2019s infrastructure problems, and he lamented the fact that the United States doesn\u2019t have the money it needs to tackle the challenge because past administrations have squandered the resources. Clinton responded immediately. Maybe, she suggested, the money wasn\u2019t there \u201cbecause you haven\u2019t paid any federal tax for a lot of years\u201d.</p> <p> While that was met with applause from the Hofstra University audience, Trump\u2019s answer was greeted only with an isolated gasp or two. Had he done so, he suggested, \u201cIt would [have been] squandered too, believe me.\u201d</p> <p> Trump didn\u2019t make a compelling case for electing a businessman as president come November \u2013 or at least not for electing this particular businessman, someone who seems to put a priority on serving himself rather than serving others, and enriching himself rather than sharing his riches. </p> <p> As CEO of the Trump Organization, The Donald could fire his employees and had no bosses. As CEO of the United States of America, he can\u2019t fire us; we\u2019re simultaneously his shareholders and his bosses. We\u2019d be hiring him, not vice versa. And it\u2019s about how he can serve us, not how well he can look out for his own interests. </p> <p> Does anything from Monday night\u2019s debate show that he has grasped that yet?</p>",

  "<p>A sweeping expansion of law enforcement\u2019s obligations to people who report their rape, which victims\u2019 advocates have hailed as groundbreaking,<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>cleared a final hurdle in Congress late Wednesday evening and landed on the desk of Barack Obama, who is expected to sign.</p> <p>The bill, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/23/sexual-assault-survivors-rape-kits-us-senate-bill-white-house\">a 24-year-old survivor of sexual assault</a> and introduced in February, extends numerous rights to people whose rape kits are being stored and processed by federal law enforcement agencies. It includes a right to have a rape kit stored, without charge, until the statute of limitations expires, and a right to be notified in writing 60 days before a rape kit is destroyed.</p> <p>Rape victims also can request to have their kit preserved under the legislation. The bill prohibits law enforcement from charging victims for a forensic exam, and victims have the right to know any important details forensic testing reveals \u2013 such as whether they ingested a date rape drug.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn federal law, there has never been a basic set of rights for survivors of sexual assault,\u201d said Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is the bill\u2019s primary sponsor. \u201cI introduced the Sexual Assault Survivors\u2019 Rights Act in the United States Senate [to] codify basic rights for survivors of sexual assault, and provide a model for similar reforms at the state level across our country.\u201d</p> <p>The bill is a rare bipartisan achievement in a Congress that has struggled to attain many others. A bitter partisan battle delayed the approval of $1.3bn to fight the Zika virus for several months, with members of Congress divided by a proposal to direct some of the money toward contraception through a sister organization of Planned Parenthood. And earlier in the month, Senate leaders signaled a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/senate-dysfunction-blocks-bipartisan-criminal-justice-overhaul.html?_r=0\">popular bill</a> to slash prison spending and reduce sentences for nonviolent offenders was likely dead. </p> <p>In stark contrast, the Sexual Assault Survivors\u2019 Rights Act passed the Senate and House with uncharacteristic speed and without a single vote of dissent.<strong> </strong>Shaheen introduced the bill in February. In May, the Senate moved unanimously to attach the bill as a rider to a sex-offender registry reauthorization act. (Wednesday night\u2019s Senate vote resolved minor differences between the two bills.) The House voted unanimously on a nearly identical proposal on 6 September, with Republican speaker Paul Ryan making a personal appeal to his party. </p> <p>But the bill would not exist without Amanda Nguyen, a 24-year-old state department liaison to the White House and aspiring astronaut. </p> <p>\u201cThis is the most comprehensive rape survivors\u2019 bill ever in US history,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cThe fact that we got this done in seven months \u2026 It\u2019s amazing. All of our hard work really shows.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/23/sexual-assault-survivors-rape-kits-us-senate-bill-white-house\">Meet the 24-year-old who could change how the US handles sexual assaults</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nguyen has been agitating for the legislation ever since her own rape several years ago exposed her to a broken system. After submitting evidence to Massachusetts through a rape kit, Nguyen was told she had 15 years to decide whether to cooperate with criminal charges \u2013 but only six months before the state was allowed to destroy her kit. As a consequence, Nguyen spends several weeks each year scrambling to locate her rape kit so she can file an extension.</p> <p>Her ordeal \u2013 once, a police officer told her the kit was likely in police custody, only for a lab technician to confirm the kit was actually at a lab \u2013 caused her to wonder about the law in other states. Nguyen compiled a list of more than 20 rights that different states guarantee to someone who reports a sexual assault.</p> <p>Eventually, the list became the basis for the bill Obama is expected sign this week.</p> <p>Shaheen met Nguyen in July 2015. By that time, Nguyen had organized a loose network of volunteers \u2013 friends, acquaintances and advocates \u2013 who gathered online to workshop legal solutions and eventually drummed up support for a bill. The group, called Rise, has since persuaded lawmakers in Massachusetts, Oregon, California and Maryland to introduce similar legislation. </p> <p>In Massachusetts, the bill has drawn a broad coalition of support, including that of the former executive director of the state\u2019s innocence project. Virginia passed a similar law this year.</p> <p>Nguyen said she was nervous going into the House vote, the last substantive obstacle facing the bill. She stood in the US Capitol for the vote, her eyes fixed on the green ticker that logs members\u2019 votes. \u201cTo see the number just go up and up and up, and finally hit the two-thirds majority to pass, we were elated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then the number just kept going up. Nobody said no.\u201d<br></p> <p>Shaheen and Nguyen hope the bill will serve as a model for lawmakers at the state level, where the vast majority of rape kits are collected, tested, and stored. The bill that has just passed Congress, which Obama is expected to sign, only applies to sexual assault cases tried in federal courts, or crimes committed on tribal lands and federal lands, such as in national parks.</p> <p>Right now, the rights extended to victims vary wildly from state to state.</p> <p>Even states that offer extensive rights to people reporting rape, such as California, are missing key protections, such as the right to a copy of their police report. Other states lack almost any protections at all. When Nguyen compiled her state-by-state list, she found the only guarantee Kansas extended was a promise not to subject reported rape victims to a polygraph test. Utah\u2019s only promise was that the state would cover the cost of testing a rape kit.</p> <p>Not a single state requires law enforcement to retain rape kits until the statute of limitations expires.</p> <p>\u201cThe real fight is in the states,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re gearing up for. We\u2019re working with a slew of state lawmakers who have already reached out and are eager to introduce this bill. And every state can do better.\u201d</p>",

Though some NYPD officials appeared to<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2287875-mta-blm-in-conjunction-w-nypd.html\"> be linked</a> to the monitoring, those documents did not confirm whether the NYPD itself was leading its own surveillance operation targeting activists.</p> <p>The attorneys litigating for the records say the NYPD\u2019s newly revealed operations are potential constitutional violations, especially since released MTA and Metro-North police observations of these protests frequently stated that the gatherings were<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/18/undercover-police-spied-on-ny-black-lives-matter/\"> \u201cpeaceful\u201d and \u201corderly\u201d.</a></p> <p>\u201cThe fear and disarming effect caused by undercovers being assigned to what were and continue to be extraordinarily peaceful protests is disturbing,\u201d said MJ Williams, one of the attorneys involved in the records request. \u201cTo the extent that it would influence individuals not to participate and get individuals to censor what they say because of a fear of undercovers \u2013 that\u2019s a basis for a first amendment violation.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cAs someone who was present at the protests, it\u2019s disturbing to know the NYPD may have a file on me, ready to be used or to prevent me from getting a job simply because I\u2019ve been active in some political capacity. That\u2019s potentially a fourth amendment violation for unlawful seizure, but on the other hand, we\u2019ve seen law enforcement agencies have all sorts of justifications for data collection for public safety that the courts have allowed.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the Freedom of Information Law request, John Donohue, the second highest ranking uniformed officer in the NYPD\u2019s intelligence bureau, argued in an affidavit that the NYPD could not release the records because public understanding of the undercover operations could help \u201cwould-be criminals\u201d learn \u201cthe circumstances in which the NYPD does not, or cannot, deploy undercover officers\u201d. The release of the \u201cmultimedia\u201d records of the protests, Donohue said, also could reveal \u201cthe kinds of optical technology NYPD uses, both in its undercover and general surveillance operations\u201d and \u201cany areas NYPD does not have under surveillance, thereby exposing gaps in coverage\u201d.</p> <p>The MTA and Metro-North disclosures from last summer revealed that transit police tracked activists\u2019 locations and shared images of some activists, like Jose La Salle, an organizer with the New York police watchdog group Copwatch Patrol Unit, and Alex Seel, a movement photographer.</p> <p>If similar multimedia images are being held by the NYPD, they<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nypd-black-lives-matter-surveillance_us_55d609a1e4b055a6dab3407a\"> could be</a> a violation of the NYPD\u2019s protest monitoring rules, known as the Handschu<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nypd-black-lives-matter-surveillance_us_55d609a1e4b055a6dab3407a\"> guidelines</a>, which are supposed to prevent the department from<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/enemies-within-by-matt-apuzzo-and-adam-goldman-2013-9\"> deploying undercovers</a> or<a href=\"http://www.nyclu.org/news/face-of-lawsuit-nypd-ends-routine-videotaping-of-protestors\"> collecting images of protesters</a> solely to keep tabs on their political activity.</p> <p>Martin Stolar, an attorney<a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/a-never-ending-lawsuit-turns-40/\"> who helped bring</a> about the Handschu guidelines in 1971, said it isn\u2019t clear if the NYPD violated the guidelines since we do not know if the monitoring is part of an authorized ongoing investigation. In an email to the Guardian, Stolar explained, the NYPD is \u201cunlikely to tell you, or anyone, whether an investigation is ongoing or not and authorized or not\u201d.<br></p> <p>The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>In recent years the NYPD has been criticized for alleged spying on political and ethnic groups without substantial evidence of criminal activity. New York City\u2019s independent police monitor released a report in<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/63e2d09bfbfb47b9a045357609ac9bc2/inspector-general-nypd-skirted-rules-surveillance\"> August</a>, concluding that between 2010 and 2015 the department routinely violated legal requirements in its monitoring of Muslim communities, failing to explain<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-broke-rules-probing-muslim-groups-inspector-general-article-1.2762445\"> its use</a> of undercovers and informants and<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/63e2d09bfbfb47b9a045357609ac9bc2/inspector-general-nypd-skirted-rules-surveillance\"> extending</a> investigations without evidence of criminal activity.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Black Lives Matter activists in New York have pointed to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeeganNYC/status/771814261169459200\">apparent sightings</a> of undercover NYPD officers at protests and claim that the surveillance is ongoing.</p> <p>\u201cThis is still happening, we still have undercovers at our protests weekly,\u201d said Armie Jeffreys, an organizer with NYC Shut It Down and Millions March. \u201cBut we\u2019re still out here. They can try if they want to, but it\u2019s not gonna stop us.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<h2>Heather, 48 \u2013 Austin, TX: \u2018Clinton will say anything to get power, Trump will just say anything\u2019</h2> <p>The reason I am undecided is because no candidate deserves my vote. </p> <p>I\u2019m a single mother of two, full-time employed, yet living paycheck to paycheck. I\u2019m insulted that women think I\u2019m obligated to vote for Clinton because she\u2019s a woman, just as I bristled at Sarah Palin as a viable choice. </p> <p>I am frustrated by the lack of candid discussion about the real issues my family and I face. Instead we waste time on gender-neutral bathrooms and whether Trump is a rude man. I lived in New York for years. He\u2019s obnoxious like a lot of New Yorkers. She\u2019s smug and patronizing, implying that I, a female voter, should just trust that she knows what is best for me. </p> <p>Neither deserves my trust (Clinton because she\u2019ll say anything to get power, Trump because he\u2019ll just say anything) and I\u2019m thinking of abstaining. It\u2019s so depressing. There should be more quality options. </p> <p>Skipping election day is an awful example to my children (both teens), but I can\u2019t stomach either candidate. As they say in sports, it\u2019ll likely be a game-day decision. </p> <h2>Drew, 33 \u2013 Brevard County, FL: \u2018Is it my fault the Democrats chose Clinton over Bernie?\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m not undecided between Trump and Clinton. My indecisiveness lies between Clinton and Jill Stein. </p> <p>I consider myself very progressive. I agree with 97% of Stein\u2019s policies (that number is verified by multiple tries of an online quiz \u2013 haha). According to the same quiz I agree over 90% with Clinton, but I can\u2019t bring myself to vote for her. I simply don\u2019t believe her. </p> <p>I believe her instincts are slanted towards conservatism. I believe she\u2019ll say anything to get elected. Deep down, I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s liberal enough and in the end, she won\u2019t come through on what she promised. </p> <p>My indecision stems from living in Florida and knowing my vote is important. </p> <p>I hate Trump and his band of racist drones. He personifies everything that\u2019s wrong with America. If I vote for Stein that could ultimately mean victory for Trump. But then, is it my fault the Democrats chose Clinton over Bernie?</p> <p>Is my vote a wasted one if I vote for Stein \u2013 or are progressive votes for Hillary the truly wasted ones?</p> <h2>Brexton, 19 \u2013 San Diego, CA: \u2018Since Bernie was defeated I have been trying really hard to like Hillary\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m undecided because I want to vote for a viable candidate but right now, I can\u2019t do that in good conscience. </p> <p>Climate change is far and away the number one issue and Jill Stein is obviously the best candidate to address that. In terms of policy proposals and electability however, Clinton has the lead. </p> <p>Since Bernie was defeated I have been trying really hard to like Hillary. Every time I come to terms with voting for her despite her long and discouraging past, she does one more thing that\u2019s exactly opposite of what liberals and progressives want, like her choice for vice-president or her continual ignoring of the #1 issue, climate change.</p> <p>Everyone always says a vote for Stein is a vote for Trump and that if he gets elected it would be third-party voters\u2019 faults. I ask why is it not Hillary\u2019s fault for not taking the few steps necessary to earn our vote. Bernie did it, now Stein\u2019s doing it. It\u2019s not hard.</p> <p>Hillary needs to make climate change and the environment a focal point of her campaign. She needs to prove that she isn\u2019t still in the hands of big money. She has only been proving the opposite again and again. I want to vote for Hillary. I just need a reason to do so.</p> <h2>Kate, 51 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA: \u2018I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything that can convince me to vote for any of the above\u2019</h2> <p>There is no one for whom I can vote with a clear conscience. <br></p> <p>To me, Hillary Clinton represents the establishment, and her election will, at best, bring four more years of government of Goldman, by Goldman, and for Goldman. Clinton is a vote for more of the same, a vote for the post-2008 status quo. Clinton is a vote for more wasted years. </p> <p>Trump, of course, isn\u2019t even remotely qualified to be president. Trump would be, I believe, a disaster, and we\u2019d finish up even worse off than we are today. Not to mention the racism, sexism and viciousness he\u2019s actively encouraged in his supporters, traits that would be amplified with his ascension to the White House. Trump is a vote for chaos. I won\u2019t vote for Trump.</p> <p>So, who\u2019s left? Jill Stein? No, too frivolous.</p> <p>Gary Johnson? No. </p> <p>I don\u2019t have a candidate in this race, but I feel like I have to vote because 2016 demands it. And it\u2019s so late in the cycle, now, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything that can convince me to vote for any of the above. Most likely I\u2019ll vote for Bernie, writing his name next to \u201cOther\u201d with a bold, black sharpie. </p> <h2>Chris, 50 \u2013 New York, NY: \u2018Clinton needs to swing more to the left and really speak to the supporters of Bernie Sanders\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve always leaned \u201cprogressive\u201d even when it wasn\u2019t in vogue. I identify loosely as a democratic socialist. So when Elizabeth Warren failed to run and Bernie Sanders picked up the mantle I was ecstatic. My enthusiasm grew the better Bernie did. I\u2019m very proud of him fighting for the $15 minimum wage, fighting for universal healthcare, making public universities free for students, putting a stop to fossil fuels, and taking climate change seriously. Perhaps most important of all, taking to task the one percenters and making them pay their fair share of taxes. Even though Bernie Sanders had difficulty connecting with the African American voter, his overall message resonated with me. It seemed quite clear that helping the economic working class would by default be helping African Americans and all minorities in this country.</p> <p>Unfortunately Bernie came up short. However, he did much better than <em>anyone</em> expected him to. One point of contention with Hillary Clinton is that she seems to take progressives and millennials for granted. Yes, she\u2019s absorbed some of Sanders\u2019 rhetoric and for that I\u2019m grateful, but there seems no conscious effort to capture the progressive zeitgeist that has captured the energy and passion of at least half the party. Also as an African American I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take her husband\u2019s policies to task. \u201cSuper-predator\u201d comments aside, they\u2019ve been incredibly damaging to African American families, from welfare to prison reform. I don\u2019t care about emails. </p> <p>Trump is a racist fascist so I can\u2019t vote for him. But Hillary comes across as untrustworthy, elitist where the rules don\u2019t apply and a insincere panderer.</p> <p>Clinton needs to swing more to the left and really speak to the supporters of Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>Clinton needs to come up with clear solutions to stop rampant police assassinations of black lives in this country. </p> <p>Maybe then she\u2019ll get my vote. Because I\u2019m liable to Just. Stay. Home.</p> <h2>Buck, 62 \u2013 Houston, TX: \u2018I want a government that does what a government should do, and nothing else\u2019</h2> <p>We live so far below our potential because most American voters are ignorant and apathetic about their government. And they vote for a person instead of an idea. I want a government that does what a government should do for its citizens, and does that fully and well, but nothing else.</p> <p>To me that is somewhere between Libertarian and the Green party. Libertarian in general but with futuristic education, healthcare, and welfare systems covering all citizens while proactively protecting our environment. We could afford that, and a fantastic national infrastructure too, if we got out of the war business, brought all our troops home, and stopped subsidizing everyone else\u2019s foreign wars that cost us trillions.</p> <p>Most of these conflicts revolve around whose imaginary friend is the best (religion), so there\u2019s nothing really being resolved by them anyway. The money we have wasted, and continue to waste on them could be put to much better use here, and we could really lead by example, but neither the Dems or GOP are \u2013 they\u2019re still just talking.</p> <h2>Bo, 22 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA: \u2018People say a vote for Jill is a vote for the GOP. I don\u2019t know what to do\u2019</h2> <p>I am afraid of voting for someone I genuinely support \u2013 Jill Stein. She is woefully underrepresented in the media, and there is endless fear-mongering to dissuade anyone from expressing interest in third-party candidates. Our votes get dubbed \u201cwasted\u201d or \u201cspoiler\u201d votes. </p> <p>I am at a loss. People say a vote for Jill is a vote for the GOP. I don\u2019t know what to do. No other candidate addresses the enslavement of millennials (via student debt) and the debilitating social conditions of everyday life (racism, corporate domination, low-income wage slavery, police brutality, a world of total-work, inadequate healthcare, etc) as comprehensively as Stein. Her emergency Green New Deal is just about the only thing that gives me hope for any kind of future.</p> <h2>Julian, 40 \u2013 China, TX: \u2018I am torn between Gary Johnson and Jill Stein\u2019</h2> <p>Here\u2019s the dilemma \u2013 I don\u2019t live in a swing state and due to the electoral college, my presidential vote is basically meaningless when it comes to casting for a Democrat or Republican. It might be hard to understand, especially to outsiders, but I am torn between Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. It\u2019s not because I prefer Johnson, but because the vote would have greater visibility than Stein.</p> <p>Being the two major party candidates are so incredibly disliked, I felt that for the first time, alternate parties could finally break through to the mainstream and end the two-party system that has been so disastrous for the nation; both major parties put the interests of the power elites and Wall Street above the rest of the country.</p> <p>I was very enthusiastic about Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign. Despite his history of calling third-party candidates spoilers for the presidential races, I really hoped he would join the Green ticket if he lost the Democratic nomination as Stein offered, or at least endorse her. I think his campaign did massive damage to a huge number of his younger followers in regards to future voter participation by endorsing Clinton. He had the perfect opportunity to break up the Democratic party if he\u2019d only fought on after he lost the nomination.</p> <p>If Bernie advocated for the Green party, far more aligned with his policies and mine than the Democrats, then I would vote for the Green party candidate this year.</p> <h2>Olivia, 27 \u2013 San Antonio, TX: \u2018Hillary, show me that you are not a \u2018My way or the highway\u2019 candidate</h2> <p>I\u2019m a millennial allied to no specific party. Both candidates seem determined to alienate \u2013 even demonize \u2013 moderate and independent voters like myself.</p> <p>Future Madame or Mr President, here are my terms:</p> <p>Donald, prove to me that you are not eager to incite a war with our neighbors, or relive the mistakes of Hoover\u2019s isolationist policies which led up to World War II.</p> <p>Hillary, show me that you are not a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d candidate, as some of your virulent advocates make you appear. Demonstrate that those who do not share all your views on a specific topic such as gun control will nevertheless be respected as equals.</p> <p>Donald, prove that you and your physically violent advocates will not spawn violent, racially charged chaos across the country and world.</p> <p>Donald and Hillary, both of you repeatedly demonstrated a shocking disdain for the integrity and even sacred role of the freedom of the press. Prove to me that you will entrust journalists with truth, and not \u201cspin\u201d. The day independent journalists are encouraged, even empowered, to question your authority is the day I may trust you. </p> <h2><br></h2>",

That would be an utter disgrace,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cThe Scottish political scene is very different, as it is also in parts of England and Wales, and as a Scot I have always felt very strongly there should be a dedicated voice.\u201d</p> <p>The Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, will now join the committee as a full member and the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, chose a representative, Alun Davies. Dugdale and Jones are prominent critics of the Labour leader and as well as securing better regional representation, the seats are a huge boost to the anti-Corbyn faction in the party. </p> <p>The committee is now finely balanced between the two wings of the party, having previously been tipped towards the leadership with six leftwing candidates being elected to the executive this summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7cb9ab9c83240b7f8667e2236e09772b6212d89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7cb9ab9c83240b7f8667e2236e09772b6212d89/452_0_864_1080/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn.

We are best when we are reflective of the broad church of our party and frankly, before these two seats, I don\u2019t think that we were. This change means power is no longer in the hands of one group.\u201d</p> <p>The NEC has power over how leaders are elected, including the number of MPs needed by each candidate to get on the ballot and who is allowed to vote, as well as the process of choosing or deselecting MPs and holding responsibility for party staff.</p> <p>Baxter said she had become increasingly concerned over the past months about attacks on staff, with many Corbyn-supporting Labour members blaming general secretary Iain McNicol and staff in the party\u2019s compliance unit, for denying some members a vote in the election either because of abuse claims, or because of an NEC decision to deny a vote to 130,000 members who had joined in the last six month. </p> <p>Baxter said she was extremely concerned about the effect of the last 12 months on party staff. \u201cThey are not in a position to speak out and have a voice for themselves on this. The reports that certain members of staff would be targeted after the leadership result were so unhelpful and divisive, and left people very worried.\u201d</p> <p>NEC meetings have rarely in the past made headline news, and Baxter said the past year had been \u201cvery difficult and increasingly fractious\u201d. \u201cI think it reflects the atmosphere that has pervaded the party of late, a lot of hate and abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of that has to stop.\u201d</p> <p>The online abuse increased when Baxter tweeted over the summer about being on the party\u2019s decision panel when concerns were flagged about new members. Many new members had complained of being \u201cpurged\u201d for their pro-Corbyn views, though the party said only 0.5% of applications had been denied a vote, for a range of reasons from not being on the electoral roll, to being members of other parties or for online hate. </p> <p>No NEC member has a casting vote, however, and decisions are made by two different panels of three committee members, with a spread of political views.</p> <p>Baxter also hinted the new political makeup of the NEC would mean no radical changes would be able to take place regarded the deselection of MPs. </p> <p>There had been speculation that parliamentarians whose seats have boundary changes could be made to face open selections, with a raft of new, leftwing candidates standing against them as the political make-up of the party shifts.</p> <p>\u201cI can understand why they would be worried about it. I\u2019m not sure it would be helpful for the first act under Jeremy\u2019s renewed leadership for there to be seen to be some sort of retribution toward members of parliament,\u201d Baxter said. </p> <p>\u201cMPs do need to reach out to the new members in their constituencies, absolutely. But the leadership could say \u2018there\u2019s no threat, normal procedures will apply.\u2019 Anything other than that would be perceived as a hostile manoeuvre.\u201d</p> <p>Baxter called being on the NEC \u201cthe most purposeful thing I have ever done\u201d and said she was devastated to no longer be on the committee, despite the turmoil of the past year. \u201cEvery time I went to a meeting I felt the weight of it. I absolutely hope others feel the same,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>After the most bitter meeting of the NEC when the decision was taken to keep Corbyn on the leadership ballot, and to introduce a cut-off date for new members and a \u00a325 fee for registered supporters, Baxter spoke out in the media saying she and others had felt bullied by the leadership. She later lost her bid for re-election to the executive, along with fellow member Ellie Reeves, both replaced by Momentum activists Rhea Wolfson and Claudia Webbe.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my party, I am not going anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to be a voice for grassroots members and some agree with Jeremy and some don\u2019t. Their voice deserves to be heard and not silenced. </p> <p>\u201cI will put the effort in but I am not willing to be uncritical of any leader. I\u2019m not going to start now. We have a responsibility to fight for our party.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Britain is one of the worst countries in Europe at integrating asylum seekers into the labour market, unnecessarily increasing their dependency on the welfare system, a report has found.</p> <p>Under British law, asylum seekers must wait for 12 months before applying for a work permit \u2013 the longest waiting time in Europe, according to <a href=\"http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/43505/Study_fromRefugeesToWorkers_2016_Vol_2.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">research from the Migration Policy Centre (MPC)</a> in Italy, and Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German thinktank.</p> <p>Even after the 12-month threshold, they are often unable to access the labour market because they cannot be self-employed or set up a business. They can also only apply for jobs within a small band of professions for which many lack the qualifications to apply.</p> <p>Even when asylum seekers are granted refugee status, researchers found that they are effectively discouraged from seeking work. The limited 28-day window which they have to find private accommodation is too short for them to find work and then earn the wages they would need to pay for a deposit on a rental contract.<br></p> <p>\u201cDue to the brevity of this period, there is a strong incentive to secure housing and out-of-work benefits rather than employment,\u201d the report says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T09:59:19/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T09:59:19/embed.html\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>This dynamic means that they are less able to contribute to the British economy, Joscha Schwarzw\u00e4lder, one of the report\u2019s authors, said in an interview. \u201cOne reason for letting asylum seekers work is that they will not have to rely on social benefits and there will be less costs for the budget,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cAnother argument is that early access to the labour market is key also for the longer-term labour market integration. In other words, if asylum seekers remain inactive for a prolonged period of time because they are prevented from accessing the jobs market, they will have more difficulties in finding employment once their asylum claim has been settled. Hence, a preventive approach might also create more costs in the longer term.\u201d</p> <p>Moe, a Syrian graduate currently seeking asylum in the UK, agreed that the restrictions made him less likely to be able to contribute to the British economy in the long term. \u201cI was told: \u2018Do not work. Do not even do voluntary work,\u2019\u201d he said. </p> <p>Moe, who asked for his surname not to be published, continued: \u201cThe problem for me is that I\u2019m a freelancer. If I continue to turn down client requests while I wait for my application, I won\u2019t have any clients by the time my application is processed. It\u2019s been almost six months since I applied, and I haven\u2019t even been assigned a case worker, which is the first step in the process after the initial screening.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Hale, the CEO of Refugee Action, a charity that helps to integrate refugees in Britain, said <a href=\"http://www.refugee-action.org.uk/assets/0001/3854/letrefugeeslearnfullreport.pdf\">a lack of English lessons was also hindering the process</a> (pdf). \u201cEnglish lessons are the first crucial step in enabling refugees to integrate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely frustrating for many refugees in Britain that there is a severe shortage of English classes. The annual cost of English classes is around \u00a31,600. This is repaid in just six months when refugees gain employment at the national average wage.\u201d</p> <p>The MPC report also suggested that the Swedish and German policy of allowing asylum seekers to work early on in their application process was key to easing them into the formal economy. It also encouraged more training schemes for refugees, which it said led to better employment rates, and found that places that offered more secure housing tended to see higher refugee employment. It also found merit in Scandinavian schemes that provide economic incentives to employers who give jobs to refugees.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s energy agenda \u2013 which includes pledges of \u201ccomplete energy independence\u201d, making coal great again and ditching the Paris climate deal \u2013 is drawing bipartisan fire from industry analysts, former members of Congress, and even one coal mogul.<br></p> <p>All of them, to varying degrees, fault the billionaire\u2019s basic premises and call his promises farfetched and at times contradictory. <br></p> <p>They say the Republican presidential candidate uses faulty math to tout his vision of America\u2019s energy independence, fails to understand energy economics in his pledge to revive the coal industry, and is peddling a big myth by claiming that global warming is a hoax.</p> <p>Some energy analysts also observe that Trump\u2019s energy prescriptions, including big regulatory cutbacks that have long been industry wishes, are politically expedient and unrealistic. In making his promise to \u201csave the coal industry\u201d, for instance, Trump has backed slashing environmental rules, taking that message to West Virginia earlier this year, when he pledged that the state\u2019s miners, as well as those in Ohio and Pennsylvania, \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2c55cd2496a14bdd98bcf84ccdb34810/ap-fact-check-bringing-coal-jobs-back-appalachia\">are going to start to work again, believe me</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow at Brookings for energy security and climate issues, told the Guardian that \u201ccoal jobs aren\u2019t coming back and for Mr Trump to say they\u2019re coming back is erroneous and fanciful\u201d. Noting that cheap natural gas has been the primary driver behind years of decline for the coal industry, Ebinger added that Trump seems to be \u201cpandering to coal miners\u201d.</p> <p>Other analysts concur. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s promise to revive the US coal sector can only be realized by reining in hydraulic fracking,\u201d said Jerry Taylor, the president of libertarian thinktank the Niskanen Center. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because low-cost natural gas (courtesy of fracking) has done far more to shut down coal-fired power plants and, correspondingly, reduce demand for US coal than has EPA regulations. Given that he promises exactly the opposite \u2013 moving heaven and earth to increase US natural gas production \u2013 Trump\u2019s promises are empty.\u201d</p> <p>Even Trump backer and coal mogul Bob Murray, who runs Murray Energy, which has given $100,000 to a pro-Trump Super Pac, says that the coal industry won\u2019t ever be great again. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be a thriving industry ever again,\u201d Murray told an energy publication this year. \u201cThe coal mines cannot come back to where they were or anywhere near it.\u201d </p> <p>Likewise, Trump used dubious data when he spoke at an energy event in May in North Dakota arranged by fracking billionaire Harold Hamm, a key Trump policy adviser who has been mentioned as a possible energy secretary and recently hosted a big campaign fundraiser.</p> <p>Echoing some of Hamm\u2019s priorities, Trump pledged to lift moratoriums on energy production in federal areas, to revoke policies that limit new drilling technologies and to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris agreement.</p> <p>Trump also promised \u201ccomplete energy independence\u201d, a bullish commitment since about a quarter of US energy needs are met by imports, and one that relied on flawed projections of proven oil reserves. Trump stated that the US had 1.5 times the oil of all Opec countries combined. But at the end of 2014, the US had proven reserves of just under 40bn barrels, while Saudi Arabia alone had proven reserves of 268bn barrels.</p> <p>Similarly, Trump claimed that constructing the Keystone XL pipeline \u2013 which, unlike Hillary Clinton, he backs \u2013 would create and support 42,000 jobs. But industry projections suggest that building the pipeline would yield about 6,000 jobs directly, and another 7,000 jobs indirectly.</p> <p>Ex-Conoco Phillips lobbyist Don Duncan compared Trump\u2019s energy proposals to those of an \u201cold snake oil salesman\u201d, saying: \u201cTrump\u2019s energy cures are based on a lot of numbers that clash with energy industry data and scientific studies.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s penchant for ignoring facts and hard evidence is also underscored by his attacks on global warming and the Paris accords.</p> <p>Trump famously <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385\">tweeted</a> in 2012 that the \u201cconcept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing less competitive\u201d. Taylor called this \u201crisible\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cNot one scintilla of evidence exists to back the charge up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another example of his willingness to say anything at all \u2013 no matter how ridiculous or dishonest \u2013 to justify the know-nothingism of his base.\u201d</p> <p>Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">denied</a> during Monday\u2019s presidential debate having said such a thing, but in a speech last December he referred to global warming as a \u201choax\u201d three times in one sentence. </p> <p>Former US congressman Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who runs a group promoting free enterprise climate change ideas, said Trump\u2019s global warming views were dangerous. \u201cPeople who presume to be leaders by offering false hope and inflaming passions are disqualifying themselves for leadership.\u201d</p>",

The fact that the region is under the watch of one of the largest peacekeeping forces in the world, and that earlier this month Sudan\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/omar-al-bashir\">Omar al-Bashir</a>, proclaimed that peace had returned to the troubled region, make Amnesty\u2019s findings all the more galling.</p> <p>After all, we are talking about the same types of war crimes that first catapulted Darfur into the world\u2019s consciousness in 2004. But this is 13 years later; and the attacks we\u2019ve documented happened between January and September 2016. The most recent was on 9 September 2016; just a few weeks ago and the day after Bashir\u2019s lofty proclamation.</p> <p>And if the use of chemical weapons is confirmed, this would represent a new level of barbarity in the conflict, and a new depth to the range of suffering endured by the Darfuri people. One woman described how her baby was still sick some six months after exposure to what she described as \u201cpoisoned air\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe baby is not recovering \u2026 he is swollen \u2026 he has blisters and wounds,\u201d she said. \u201cThe [medical staff] say he will get better if he drinks [breast] milk \u2026 but it is not working.\u201d</p> <p>Chemical weapons have been banned for decades at the international level in recognition of the fact that the suffering they cause can never be justified. Credible evidence that Sudan\u2019s government might now repeatedly be using them simply cannot be ignored.</p> <p>More than a decade ago, the international criminal court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/15/south-africa-to-fight-omar-al-bashirs-arrest-warrant-sudan\">(ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Bashir</a> on three counts of genocide, five counts of crimes against humanity and two counts of war crimes. And yet, the president has since won two elections and travelled regularly, including to Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. As signatories to the <a href=\"https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/intro/585\">Rome statute which created the ICC</a>, each of these countries had a duty to arrest Bashir on his arrival. None of them did.</p> <p>Absolutely no effective measures have ever been put in place to protect civilians in Darfur despite being under the watch of a joint <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unamid/\">African Union and United Nations peacekeeping mission</a> (Unamid). Peace talks and agreements have brought no security or respite for the Darfuri people.</p> <p>The response of the international community in the last 10 years has been utterly deplorable and in the face of such an ineffective reaction, it is little wonder that Al-Bashir\u2019s hubris has grown.</p> <p>In the light of this shocking new evidence, and on the eve of the UN security council meeting in New York, we are calling on it to do more to protect the children, men and women of Darfur.</p> <p>It can do this by applying political pressure on the government of Sudan to ensure that the Unamid peacekeeping force, as well as humanitarian agencies, can access parts of Darfur such as Jebel Marra, where some of the worst abuses appear to be happening. There need to be more peacekeeping bases, and they must be able to conduct proactive patrols deep into these remote areas.</p> <p>There also needs to be an urgent investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Jebel Marra and, if there is sufficient evidence, prosecutions of all those suspected of criminal responsibility must follow.</p> <p>Bashir must learn that there are consequences when crimes under international law are committed. There has been 13 years of catastrophic violence and recurring human rights violations; it\u2019s time the world set its focus, once more, on Darfur and act.</p>",

Both persevered with the rugged determination of experienced runners for whom winning is an added bonus rather than a primary motivation.</p> <p>At 200km mark I found myself in the wholly unfamiliar position of being in the lead, much to the excitement of various friends, family and colleagues who were tracking on the race website. </p> <p>Competing over a distance like this is unlike a normal race. While speed is important it is more a matter of attrition and strategy. Much as racing drivers make pit stops we would periodically pull over into a rest station where an army of volunteers was on hand to help (the ratio of volunteers to runners was 9:1). In my case this would mean downing a Coca-Cola, scoffing some noodles and a Mars bar and having my growing number of blisters drained and dressed by the expert <a href=\"http://exile-medics.com/\">Exile Medics</a>. </p> <p>As we approached the final part of the race (just 100km to go) I was being chased down by the famous Chinese runner Bai Bin who had come second in last year\u2019s race and was back to win it. The terrain at this point was mountainous and extremely tough. Scrambling up hills and out of canyons is hard enough in the day, but doing it in pitch darkness with little sleep and a delirious mind adds a whole new challenge. Twice I slipped and saw a water bottle fall from my pack and disappear down a slope.</p> <p>Sadly by this point my right ankle had swelled to the point where fitting a sock over it was a real struggle; it was simply a case of strapping it up and plodding on. With 40km to go Bai Bin sauntered past looking very fresh. It was reassuring to see that even in my best physical condition I would have struggled to keep up. His stamina and endurance towards the end of the race were truly impressive and deserving of the victory.</p> <p>The last 34km were particularly tough as I braced myself for the pain for each step (of which there were roughly half a million over the course of the race). Eventually, at 4am on Sunday morning, after 94 hours - including about five of sleep - I hobbled across the finish line, a spectacular set-up in a park in Guazou complete with fireworks, drummers and a very patient media crew.</p> <p>I had just about enough energy to receive the second half of my \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_(tally)\">tiger talley</a>\u2019, drink a beer and give a blood test for a research project (I did have to lie down at this point but that was more because of the needle) before being transported to the nearby hotel and to a very welcome shower and bed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/sep/27/the-gobi-desert-ultramarathon-the-hardest-race-in-the-world\">The Ultra Trail of the Gobi \u2013 the hardest race in the world?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>22 hours, 131km</strong><br><br>Today I learned that one thing you can\u2019t afford to have on a race like this is a sense of perspective.

  "<p><span tabindex=\"-1\">There\u2019s a war going on behind closed doors for control of your smartphone. It\u2019s between the phone makers and the operators, but it\u2019s not over privacy or data or cost \u2013 it\u2019s over you.</span></p> <p>The battles are raging over who owns the consumer and your phone: is it the buyer or the manufacturer? And is the smartphone a device you purchase, or a service you pay for monthly?</p> <p>The boom years for the industry, when a smartphone was a user\u2019s first, are long gone in developed nations with most smartphones now sold to people who already have one. In the US and UK market penetration has hit roughly 85%. This means the growth a phone maker needs each year can only come at the expense of a competitor. And that has changed how the manufacturers see the market.</p> <p>Marina Koytcheva, director of forecasting at CCS Insight says: \u201cAfter years of analysts and commentators talking about mobile phone market peaking within the visible horizon, it has now reached that point.\u201d</p> <p>The research firm expects total mobile phone sales to decline by 1.3% this year over last, with smartphones accounting for almost three-quarters of the market and up only 4.1% globally. </p> <p>At the same time smartphone innovation has largely stagnated and users are holding on to their devices longer.</p> <p>Francisco Jeronimo, IDC\u2019s research director for European mobile devices, says: \u201cNo one gets as excited about the latest phone any more as they used to get in the past three to four years. It\u2019s more of the same. They all look the same, they have similar screen sizes, cameras, etc etc.\u201d</p> <p>Fewer purchases mean the big smartphone players are now under pressure to extract more revenue from their existing user base, which is easier for Apple and its App Store than others reliant on Google\u2019s Play Store, and to try to convince users that life is greener on their side of the smartphone divide.</p> <p>In the UK, Samsung and Apple have been fighting over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/17/samsung-apple-smartphone-ios-android\">the so-called floating voter</a> - the 20% of smartphones buyers that switch platforms. That 20% churn is a missed opportunity for each manufacturer, prompting them to look at ways to lock customers in.</p> <p>At the same time, the mobile phone operators are in a similar competition. Switching between the major phone networks has always been an issue, whether it\u2019s over price, customer service or the latest handset.</p> <p>To combat churn, O2 launched its Refresh plans in 2013, which essentially decoupled the fees users paid for network operator services \u2013 the minutes, text messages and data \u2013 from the fees users pay for the smartphone. In 2015 it launched a modified version for yearly upgrades.</p> <p>The marketing and consumer director for O2, Nina Bibby, says: \u201cO2 Refresh provides transparency and flexibility for the customer - once they\u2019ve paid off their smartphone their bill automatically drops. Because it offers real benefits we\u2019re seeing lower churn.\u201d</p> <p>Apple followed suit, launching its iPhone upgrade programme in the US last year and the UK this year. Samsung too, launched an upgrade programme this year in the UK. In both schemes, customers pay a monthly fee and get a new phone every year or two.</p> <p>Jeronimo says: \u201cIf phone makers manage to convince people that the phone is a service, paying an instalment every month and getting a new phone 12 months later, it will change the current trend and convince people to upgrade more often. And it will keep them using the same brand.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturers attempting to push their own upgrade programmes - the phone as a service - are seeing pushback from operators, which do not want to relinquish control of the end user. </p> <p>Jeronimo says: \u201cPeople will realise that it\u2019s better to pay \u00a340-50 to Apple and get a new phone every 12 months than, say, pay \u00a340 to the mobile operator and be locked for 24 months to them. But mobile operators are still the dominant channel in most countries in Europe, so it will take time.\u201d</p> <p>For O2, the best known instigators of the new instalment trend, its unique selling point is the flexibility to switch handset makers.</p> <p>Bibby says: \u201cImitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Flexibility like this is just the next stage of innovation so we\u2019re not surprised to see others adopting it. Manufacturers are trying to ensure that more of their own handsets are sold in the market. They\u2019re trying to clearly compete with each other.\u201d</p> <p>For now, the battle for control of the phone in your hand is happening behind closed doors. Soon we\u2019ll begin to see the phone-as-a-service idea pushed by one of the big manufacturers, but only once the operators are no longer crucial to sales.</p> <p>Jeronimo says: \u201cPeople are getting more used to the idea of a phone as a service, but no one has been promoting the phone as a service yet, it\u2019s all been about upgrading thus far. Once a phone manufacturer comes and says we\u2019ll sell you a service not a device from now on, I think we\u2019ll see a big uptake.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/iphone-7-review-poor-battery-life\">iPhone 7 review: how good can a phone be if the battery doesn\u2019t last even a day?</a></strong><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review-android-smartphone-phablet-marshmallow\"><strong>Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review: this is the smartphone to beat</strong></a></li> </ul>",

As adults themselves, many describe how they struggle and fail to trust anyone, particularly authority figures who wield power in institutions.</p> <p>Perhaps the primary requirement of a national public inquiry into the sexual abuse of tens of thousands of children over decades within England and Wales was to seek their trust and gain their confidence. </p> <p>Yet in the last few months the shambolic goings on at the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) \u2013 the sudden departure of another chair, the manoeuvrings in secret over its remit, the future of the project to gather the testimonies of victims and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/29/suspension-of-child-abuse-inquiry-lawyer-ben-emmerson-is-devastating-blow\">suspension and subsequent resignation of its lead counsel, Ben Emmerson</a> \u2013 may have dealt a fatal blow to those aims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/05/uk-child-abuse-inquiry-lost-three-chairs-timeline\">How child abuse inquiry lurched from 'catastrophe to catastrophe' \u2013 timeline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Secrecy and a lack of transparency have encroached upon the inquiry, sitting in its Millbank offices looking out over the seat of power.

When heads fall \u2013 three chairs, members of the senior counsel team and now Emmerson \u2013 the bureaucrats from the Home Office and government remain in place. No wonder some victims laugh at the idea it is independent.</p> <p>But as Ian McFadyen, a survivor of abuse, said on Thursday: \u201cIt is not rocket science.\u201d</p> <p>Running a major public inquiry is possible and has been done before, difficult, lengthy and expensive though it is: Bloody Sunday, the Bristol children\u2019s heart hospital inquiry, the Scott inquiry into arms to Iraq and, an example which should shame those involved in IICSA, the royal commission into child abuse in Australia. The latter continues to expose the cover-ups within institutions like the church and to give voice to victims whose testimony is at the heart of the process in a focused, organised and devastating way.</p> <p>The departure of Emmerson \u2013 who said in a statement that no allegations had been put to him \u2013 is a huge blow. He sat at the head of a team of lawyers, oversaw the different strands of the inquiry and for many victims represented the bullish independence from the Home Office that the inquiry needed. He holds the knowledge and in the face of the flux of the last year he has represented continuity. Replacing him will be difficult but it must be done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/child-sex-abuse-inquiry-uk-scale-catastrophe\">The scale of historical sexual abuse in the UK is a catastrophe. We need catharsis | Beatrix Campbell </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The mammoth scale of the inquiry and its focus on the past is often used as an excuse for its failures so far. But surely in order to protect children today and in the future we have to stare down the cover-ups of the past and listen to those who as children were exposed, sometimes deliberately, to paedophiles. Without that honesty, how can we begin to change things for the better?</p> <p>If it is felt the remit of the inquiry is growing out of control to the extent that its scale threatens to jeopardise its aims to find the truth that will help protect children today, then it is surely not beyond the wit of the highly paid lawyers, civil servants and panel members to look flexibly at the problem, come to a solution and agree it with the home secretary. </p> <p>But is that really necessary? As it stands the independent inquiry is running 13 separate investigations into abuse within several institutions including the church, the Medomsley detention centre and children\u2019s homes. These are already gathering documentary evidence and have held preliminary hearings; each has its own lead inquiry member and they operate as separate inquiries within the overarching monolith of IICSA. </p> <p>In one case, Lambeth, much of the work has been done already thanks to the incredible efforts of Raymond Stevenson, who was abused in the Shirley Oaks children\u2019s home run by Lambeth in the 70s, and has traced hundreds of others who were in the south London homes between 1950 and 2003. He is building a database of where children were abused, where their stories corroborate each other and whom they have named as abusers. </p> <p>Whether Stevenson agrees to take part in the inquiry hangs in the balance as he contests the appointment of a chair, Alexis Jay, who was herself a senior social worker \u2013 the profession that put many of the Lambeth children into harm\u2019s way.

In the US, the epidemic of police shootings of black people has raised similar concerns. </p> <p>The Cambridge study, conducted during 2014-15 across seven trial sites that covered a population of more than 2 million people, set out to investigate the difference made by the cameras, which are usually attached to the top half of police uniforms. </p> <p>Throughout the year-long experiment, researchers were said to have randomly assigned about half of the officers starting their shifts with cameras. All officers in the forces taking part worked with cameras at some point, the researchers said. </p> <p>During the 12 months before the study, a total of 1,539 complaints were lodged against police in the areas examined, amounting to 1.2 complaints per officer. By the end, the number of complaints had fallen to 133 for the year across all sites \u2013 0.08 per officer.</p> <p>The researchers were surprised to find that there was no statistically significant difference between the number of complaints received by officers wearing cameras and those without, a result they said may be a result of \u201ccontagious accountability\u201d.</p> <p>Co-author Dr Alex Sutherland, of Rand Europe, said: \u201cIt may be that, by repeated exposure to the surveillance of the cameras, officers changed their reactive behaviour on the streets \u2013 changes that proved more effective and so stuck.</p> <p>\u201cWith a complaints reduction of nearly 100% across the board, we find it difficult to consider alternatives, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>The findings come with an important caveat, which is that the behaviour changes appeared to rely on cameras recording throughout encounters with the public, and officers explicitly warning that they were on, the researchers said. </p> <p>Early findings from the study, published earlier this year, suggested that violence actually increased if a camera was switched on in the middle of an interaction, a move that could be interpreted by both sides as an escalation. </p> <p>Ariel said that verbal reminders that encounters were being filmed encouraged participants \u201cto think about their actions more consciously.

  "<p>Shortly after the bathetic sight of Sam Allardyce slinking out of Wembley without having ever sat in its dugout as England manager, the Football Association\u2019s recently appointed chairman emerged blinking into the flashbulbs for a traditional rite of passage.

Which is part of the problem. Such is the pace of turnover among senior FA executives that they remain doomed to repeat history as farce but, when they spoke, their reasons for letting Allardyce go were well argued. Glenn on Wednesday said that it was the FA\u2019s job as regulator and governing body to uphold the game\u2019s integrity and as such it was impossible for the 61-year-old to continue as England manager.</p> <p>There is already a range of views \u2013 from those who feel the FA was weak in caving in to those who feel it had no other option \u2013 but it is hard to argue that it did not act in a swift and reasonable fashion.</p> <p>The role that Glenn, the former United Biscuits chief executive who entered Wembley in a whirl of restructuring activity, imagined for the FA \u2013 a noble upholder of the game\u2019s standards \u2013 and led to its decision to cut Allardyce loose is no longer the case, if it ever was. The huge global expansion of the game, lubricated by billions spent by fans and the ambitions of thrusting individuals, companies and entire countries, has ushered in a world that has spun far beyond the FA\u2019s control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/fa-chief-sorry-sam-allardyce-england-job-lifetime\">FA chief felt sorry Sam Allardyce lost England job of a lifetime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The way the Quest investigation in the middle of the last decade \u2013 when Allardyce, who denied wrongdoing, was implicated \u2013 was passed around various stakeholders before being kicked into the long grass by Fifa is instructive.</p> <p>Even the agents themselves agree, even though it would be foolish to necessarily take them at face value and self preservation may be one motivation. \u201cThe global move to deregulation has not worked and it has allowed the system to be more open to manipulation and abuse,\u201d said the Association of Football Agents on Wednesday.</p> <p>In his recent book, First Artist\u2019s Phil Smith wrote of a \u201clawless world of secret agents\u201d. \u201cThere is more money disappearing out of the game through agents operating with impunity, but the authorities do not want the fight,\u201d he claimed.</p> <p>The real dangers to the integrity of the game come less from the sort of old-fashioned extras referred to in the latest round of newspaper reports than the vast unregulated web of offshore companies, third-party ownership models (supposedly banned, still rampant) that buy and sell portions of players like chattels, the power that has distilled into the hands of a handful of so-called super agents and their associates and so on and on. The game has stayed the same but the methods and sums involved have changed. Brown paper envelopes in service stations are out, complex cross-border transactions and offshore models are in.</p> <p>We have the illusion of some transparency \u2013 the amount spent by clubs on agents\u2019 fees is now published quarterly, for example. Fifa\u2019s Transfer Matching System logs the details of overseas transactions and publishes the huge sums involved once a year. But large amounts of money continue to move around the world in largely unregulated fashion and too much remains unknown about where it ends up. Certainly, football\u2019s governing bodies do not have the tools or the will to police it properly.</p> <p>In some ways it is a microcosm of the way the globalised, tax averse, opaque world of big business and corporate finance has gone in general. Only occasionally, as with the Panama Papers or the FBI\u2019s Fifa probe, is there a glimpse of one portion of it before the waters close over again. If the FA wants to reassert its long-relinquished position as football\u2019s moral compass, it would do well to unapologetically reclaim its role as the game\u2019s regulator.</p> <p>Some of this goes back to the dry governance issues that have remained unresolved for decades \u2013 making the FA Council more representative, the FA executive more effective, properly separating out its disciplinary function.</p> <p>If Glenn and Clarke want to show that the FA upholds the standards that apparently led them to conclude that Allardyce had to go, then making a definitive move to at least try to attempt some oversight of the vast sums of money now swilling around the top end of the game might be a good place to start.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the fact that United sent their scout to watch our game against Vorskla,\u201d the Zorya Luhansk coach, Yuriy Vernydub, said this week, which makes a change from those managers who try desperately to hide themselves away from future opponents. \u201cBefore, they used to say that no one knew about Zorya, whereas now scouts are watching our boys. It means that the players deserve that.\u201d</p> <p>Zorya have particular reason to want to be known: their very existence in European competition feels like a triumph. In June 2014, the Ukrainian club were forced to flee Luhansk because of the conflict with pro-Russia separatists who founded the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic. Zorya\u2019s home ground, the Avangard Stadium, suffered heavy shelling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/juan-mata-wayne-rooney-manchester-united\">Juan Mata\u2019s mastery may push Wayne Rooney to Manchester United margins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They moved to Zaporizhzhya, 400km to the south-west, where they play home games at the Slavutych Arena. Its address, just over the road from the Museum of the History of Warfare on Bulvar Lobanovskoho, gives an indication of Zaporizhzhya\u2019s main place in Ukrainian football history: it was there in May 2002, leading his Dynamo Kyiv side against Metalurh, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/15/guardianobituaries.brianglanville\" title=\"\">Valeriy Lobanovskyi</a> collapsed in the dug-out, dying a few days later in hospital.</p> <p>Vernydub\u2019s spirit of openness also makes a significant change from how things used to be in Zaporizhzhya. In Soviet times it was a closed town because of its role in the energy industry, the site of both Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant and a huge hydroelectric dam (Zaporizhzhya means \u201cbeyond the rapids\u201d).</p> <p>Zorya have thrived in adversity. Their players have reportedly not been paid in six months \u2013 not an uncommon story in modern Ukraine \u2013 but despite that and despite playing away from home they finished fourth in the league last season, their highest placing since surprisingly lifting the Soviet title in 1972. They have continued their form this season, Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win over Vorskla leaving them second in the table.</p> <p>\u201cI hope we will put on a decent performance in Manchester, although it will be very difficult,\u201d said Vernydub. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to compare our clubs in terms of anything, be it squads or finances. But that will make our match-up even more interesting. Am I nervous? Not yet.</p> <p>\u201cNervousness comes on the day of the match and during the opening five to 10 minutes of the game. We respect our opponents a lot and understand that we will face a very strong club. But we are ready for that. United have weaknesses too. We must take to the pitch and fight.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0025e00533d56dfaa36231dc67467a9056fa119d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0025e00533d56dfaa36231dc67467a9056fa119d/0_151_1577_946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vernydub\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The coach Yuriy Vernydub, the driving force behind Zorya\u2019s success.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nobody doubts that Vernydub is the real star of Zorya. The 50-year-old had a journeyman career in the 80s and 90s as a defender or midfielder, playing 112 games for Metalurh Zaporizhzhya and 76 for Torpedo, the other club in the city, before a late-career flourish at Zenit St Petersburg, with whom he won the Russian Cup in 1999.</p> <p>He returned to Zaporizhzhya and worked as a coach at Metalurh before becoming the assistant manager of Zorya in 2009. When Anatoly Chantsev was sacked in 2011, Vernydub was placed in temporary control, taking the job permanently after a 0-0 draw with Dynamo.</p> <p>His reputation has grown to the extent that when Mircea Lucescu left Shakhtar Donetsk last summer, he was considered a serious candidate before Paulo Fonseca got the job. Relations between the two displaced clubs remain strong, though, and at Old Trafford Zorya may feature as many as six players on loan from Shakhtar.</p> <p>Verydub tends to prefer a 4\u20112\u20111\u20113 shape, with a gameplan based on diligence, teamwork and high tempo. They perhaps lack a little guile and can struggle against teams who set out to frustrate them, and are at their best when they can sit deep and attack the space behind an opponent.</p> <p>They have pace in wide areas, with the rapid full-backs, Yevhen Opanasenko and Nikita Kamenyuka, always looking to get forward and join a counterattack. Recent results against Ukraine\u2019s big clubs suggest how dangerous they can be: in the past two years Zorya have beaten Shakhtar 1-0 away and 3-2 at home, as well as achieving a 2-2 draw and a 1-0 win at Dynamo.</p> <p>Even after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/europa-league-roundup-dundalk-alkmaar\" title=\"\">1-1 home draw against Fenerbahce</a> in their opening Europa League group game, no one is thinking quite in those terms about the trip to Manchester. Most players, in fact, seem vaguely bewildered the match is happening at all. \u201cUnited are not just serious opponents, but very serious ones,\u201d said the midfielder Dmytro Hrechyshkin, one of those on loan from Shakhtar.</p> <p>\u201cAs for them underestimating us, I doubt it will be the case. In light of our recent results, I think United will take us seriously. Every player dreams of playing against such clubs as United. Apart from on a computer game, it was difficult to envisage a game between United and Zorya a few years ago. To be honest, I haven\u2019t even dreamt of playing at Old Trafford, but I hope that I will.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Entering The Platform \u2013 a community space in Loughborough Junction in south London filled with plants, homemade beauty products and crafts, and home to a host of workshops and cultural events \u2013 it is hard to imagine its former incarnation as a public toilet. But it is usually the first thing locals remark on when they stop by, says Kenyasue Smart, who has been managing the space since May.</p> <p>Smart came to The Platform through Meanwhile Space, a social enterprise that finds temporary uses for disused spaces. The Platform is leased from Lambeth council for free and enables people to test retail ideas. \u201cIt\u2019s what you make of it,\u201d says Smart, whose background is in research and management. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to develop that aspect of community involvement so the people here can have a voice in what is going to happen in the future,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile Space works as an interim landlord, helping people who might be excluded from renting commercial property get their business idea off the ground. \u201cWhat I hope we offer people is the chance to fail,\u201d says Eddie Bridgeman, director and co-founder of the organisation. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out then they haven\u2019t committed themselves to a long lease and something that\u2019s going to financially cripple them for the next five to 10 years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62b16ccee80fd236158be00a3c1a3758922b4201\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62b16ccee80fd236158be00a3c1a3758922b4201/0_0_719_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"The railway arches in Loughborough Junction\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Platform in Loughborough Junction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Meanwhile Space</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bridgeman and director Emily Berwin co-founded Meanwhile Space in 2009.

When the fuding ended three years ago, it became a community interest company, making money by charging tenants rent at cheap rates.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In recent years, commercial property rents have rocketed, making it hard to find affordable space in London. Rent increased 70% between 2010 and 2015 to an average of \u00a355 per square foot, according to <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/uk/en/newsroom/news-releases/16-04-11---london-commercial-property-rents-rise-by-70-in-five-years-ey-research-reveals\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent research by EY</a>. </p> <p>Bridgeman says at first they were concerned that Meanwhile Space would just be a recession business. \u201cBut if anything when property is booming landlords are more willing to sit on stuff so the vacant opportunities come along a bit more regularly,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Once a location is scouted \u2013 usually after a bit of door knocking and calls to the Land Registry \u2013 Meanwhile Space negotiates a flexible lease and does minimal renovations before renting it out for the lowest cost possible. An archway in Loughborough Junction, for example, is about \u00a3350 a month.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The organisation tends to find clusters of properties in deprived town centres. It has occupied over 40 across the country and has about 25 spaces in use at the moment, including premises in Wembley, Walthamstow and Hastings, for a range of businesses such as food, florists, party supplies and kids clothing. From its inception to 2015, it claims to have supported 511 people and created 170 jobs. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a proposal and need the space then we will try and find you the space,\u201d says Bridgeman.</p> <p>The tenants \u2013 about 80% of whom are underemployed or unemployed according to Meanwhile Space \u2013 are found through word of mouth, ties to local recruitment agencies and community events, such as the recent drumming workshop hosted at The Platform.

  "<blockquote> <p><em>My son wants to start posting YouTube videos. Can you recommend a decent camera? It will be used for taking videos of himself talking.</em> <strong>Paula</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>You can use any of a vast range of devices to make YouTube videos. A laptop with a built-in webcam is probably the easiest option, but the obvious alternative is a smartphone. Most digital cameras can now shoot video as well.</p> <p>The fact that so many people have the equipment must be partly responsible for the huge number of videos uploaded to YouTube \u2013 300 hours-worth per minute. </p> <p>Watch a few and you\u2019ll notice that the quality ranges from execrable to professional. However, poor videos can\u2019t always be blamed on poor equipment. In fact, professional video makers can produce good videos with indifferent kit, while beginners can produce mediocre results even with the best equipment.</p> <h2><strong>Doing it right</strong></h2> <p>Good YouTubers pay attention to things like image stability, lighting, picture composition and sound quality. They start by mounting the smartphone or camera on a tripod, because a stable image looks better than one created with an unsteady handheld camera.</p> <p>They also make sure that their subject \u2013 especially if it\u2019s just one person speaking to camera \u2013 is well lit. Digital cameras produce good results when there\u2019s plenty of light: your sunny holiday snaps probably look great. They struggle in low light conditions, often producing images that look grainy due to digital \u201cnoise\u201d. They also struggle with high-contrast lighting, though experts can use manual controls to exploit that.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a beginner, the best free option is a well-lit, white-walled room, but try to declutter the background. Putting a desk lamp above and behind the camera is better than nothing. If the result looks harsh, put some greaseproof paper or tissue paper in front to soften the light. (Keep paper well away from incandescent bulbs: they get hot.)</p> <p>Neewer makes a range of dimmable, battery-powered LED light arrays that you can fit into a camera hot-shoe or mount on a tripod. They\u2019re cheap \u2013 they start at around <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Neewer-Bestlight-Adapter-Olympus-Camcorders/dp/B00HF35QW2\">\u00a320</a> to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dimmable-Digital-Camcorder-Panasonic-Samsung/dp/B004TJ6JH6/\">\u00a330</a> \u2013 and work well, but there are several alternatives. (Batteries are usually not included: buy rechargeables.)</p> <p>Serious YouTubers often work hard to capture good quality sound, and high-end microphones like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0002PSCQM/\">Rode NT1-A</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/PR-40-Professional-Studio-Vocal-Microphone/dp/B002OSQ9TC/\">Heil PR40</a> are often conspicuous. However, even a cheap lapel mic like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lavalier-Microphone-Smartphone-Canon-Camera/dp/B00MPDYGBE/\">Boya BY-M1</a> (\u00a314.99) will produce better results than a built-in mic, partly because it\u2019s much closer to your mouth. Alternatives include gaming headsets and some earbuds, if you don\u2019t mind wearing them.</p> <p>You can also use a camera, make a separate digital recording, and combine the sound and visuals later. Most video editing programs, including Windows Movie Maker, can do this.</p> <h2><strong>Use what you have</strong></h2> <p>Rather than buying a new camera, get your son to experiment with devices that you already own. Any laptop with a built-in HD webcam \u2013 one that shoots 720p video \u2013 should be good enough to start with. If it doesn\u2019t produce good results even in decent lighting (some of them don\u2019t), you can buy an external USB webcam. If it\u2019s the sound that\u2019s the problem, try an external microphone such as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ZH4STB6/\">BM-800</a> (\u00a317.99) or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006DIA77E/\">Blue Microphones\u2019 Snowball iCE</a> (\u00a348.98).</p> <p>When buying a webcam, look for Full HD resolution \u2013 one that shoots 1080p video. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-C920-Pro-1080p-Webcam/dp/B006A2Q81M/\">Logitech C920 HD Pro</a> is popular with YouTubers, and reasonably priced at \u00a357.98. There are cheaper alternatives, such as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/PAPALOOK-Microphone-Recording-Broadcasting-Compatible/dp/B01GYFOXK2/\">Papalook PA452</a> (\u00a319.99). The<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-C525-HD-Webcam-Black/dp/B01BGBJ8SQ/\"> Logitech C525</a> (\u00a330.79 or \u00a344.99) would also work well, though it only does 720p video.</p> <p>Most smartphones can do the job, too, especially if you can add an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=smartphone+microphone\">external microphone</a>. The smartphone should be mounted on a small tripod, such as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01JBTPYZG/\">Everesta Flexible Octopus</a> (\u00a311.99), for stability. Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=smartphone+tripod\">lots of alternatives</a>. Either way, it must be horizontal. On YouTube, vertical videos are an abomination.</p> <h2><strong>Moving up</strong></h2> <p>Digital cameras generally produce better-looking results, and from a photographic point of view, they are more versatile than smartphones.</p> <p>They have three drawbacks. First, they\u2019re relatively \u2013 and sometimes absolutely \u2013 expensive. Second, not many have microphone sockets, so you may have to record sound separately. Third, you can\u2019t see yourself talking, unless you get one with a hinged screen that flips up or swivels around to face the front.</p> <p>I asked Gordon Laing, of <a href=\"http://www.cameralabs.com/\">CameraLabs</a> fame, for advice. I\u2019d just watched a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrtUPWs__Dk\">YouTube review</a> that he did with Doug Kaye, a professional photographer who uses a top-level system. Gordon said that, for his end, he\u2019d used the webcam in his laptop, with the mic built into his earphones. It\u2019s good, but the video shows the difference in quality between the two approaches.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I can\u2019t find any cheap digital cameras with microphone sockets and articulating screens. The old <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nikon-Coolpix-P7800-Compact-Digital/dp/B00F062MI2/\">Nikon Coolpix P7800</a> looks ideal if you can find one second hand. I picked up an original <a href=\"http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_m/\">Canon EOS M</a> mirrorless when Argos was clearing them out for \u00a3200, but it doesn\u2019t have an articulating screen.</p> <p>The GoPro Hero 2 also had a microphone socket, and you can add an <a href=\"https://havecamerawilltravel.com/photographer/gopro-external-microphones\">external mic</a> to some of the Hero 4 cameras. This should appeal to YouTubers who make action videos, but it\u2019s not the best thing for talking heads.</p> <p>Asked for a good compact, Gordon suggested the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-20-3/dp/B00NLBGCZW/\">Canon PowerShot G7 X</a>, which you can find discounted to \u00a3379 now the Mark II version is out. At that price, you might as well get a DSLR that shoots professional-standard 1080p YouTube video. There\u2019s a huge selection with mic inputs.</p> <p>Gordon adds: \u201cFor me the holy trinity for high quality one-man vlogging are a screen that can flip to face you, an input for an external microphone and a decent-sized sensor that can smoothly track and refocus on a face. Most modern cameras have two out of three, but surprisingly few complete the hat trick. Canon\u2019s triple-digit EOS DSLRs manage it, but there\u2019s no need to go for the latest 750D or 760D: the earlier 700D and even 650D have everything you need.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>TL;DR</strong></h2> <p>Start with a laptop or a smartphone. If it\u2019s a laptop, try the built-in webcam, and upgrade to an external webcam such as the Logitech C920 HD Pro when you need it. If it\u2019s a smartphone, mount it on a tripod and look for a good <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=smartphone+microphone\">external microphone</a>. In both cases, think about buying an external light such as one of the Neewer models.</p> <p>In theory, you could buy a digital camera, but affordable ones don\u2019t have microphone sockets. However, you might be able to find a cheap second hand Nikon Coolpix P7800 or Canon EOS M for use with an external microphone.</p> <p>A DSLR can provide professional results, but it may be several years before it\u2019s worth buying this sort of kit. Happily, successful YouTubers can earn enough to pay for it themselves.</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

  "<p>Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe is to step down as commissioner of the Metropolitan police after a tumultuous period leading Britain\u2019s biggest police force.<br></p> <p>He completed his full five-year term as commissioner of the Met just over a fortnight ago, but had his contract extended by a year, which would have seen him in the job until September 2017.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/met-police-chief-contenders-favourites-long-shots\">Contenders for the next Met police chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sources in the Met and the mayor of London\u2019s office insisted Hogan-Howe was not forced out but had chosen when to leave. There had been some tension between the new Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the commissioner, who was appointed in 2011 by Khan\u2019s Conservative predecessor, Boris Johnson, and the thenhome secretary, Theresa May.</p> <p>Khan said on Thursday he had nothing to do with Hogan-Howe\u2019s decision. When asked if he had any involvement, he told reporters: \u201cThat isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s to do with Bernard\u2019s decision to retire. </p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to go, we worked incredibly well together. But I am grateful he gave me and the home secretary sufficient notice.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan-Howe said he had an excellent relationship with Khan. Asked if he was worried that the mayor was not going to reappoint him, he said: \u201cNo, not at all, it could have happened at any time over the next two years. <br></p> <p>\u201cFor me, definitely, I had decided it would be in the next year and, as things were falling out in terms of our plans, it just seemed to be a good chance to make this change now and then make sure that we allowed a decent time to select my successor for what is a vital role, an important one.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan-Howe had been understood to be willing to serve longer if needed, but he is the first commissioner in more than a decade to complete his full term. His two immediate predecessors were forced from office.</p> <p>His departure came weeks ahead of a report into the Met\u2019s handling of historical sex abuse cases, which is expected to be critical. The Met is also facing \u00a3400m of budget cuts by 2020, on top of large cuts it has already undergone.</p> <p>One police source said the commissioner\u2019s \u201clong-term aim was to go at a time of his own choosing\u201d, and that was exactly what he had done.<br></p> <p>Hogan-Howe will stay in his post until February 2017, while the mayor and the home secretary choose a successor. Downing Street is expected to have a strong say. The lack of an obvious successor led to speculation Hogan-Howe might have stayed on and been granted a further extension.</p> <p>Senior figures in the mayor\u2019s team thought Hogan-Howe was doing a good job. A week ago, the deputy mayor for policing and crime, Sophie Linden, said she had full confidence in him.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe became commissioner on 12 September 2011, after the force had been hit by the worst riots in modern English history. Crime fell by 18% during most of his time in office, though some categories are now rising. <br></p> <p>His predecessor, Sir Paul Stephenson, was forced from the job as a result of the phone-hacking scandal, and before him, Sir Ian Blair quit after he was told he had lost Johnson\u2019s confidence. </p> <p>Hogan-Howe\u2019s biggest achievement may well have been to show that the job of Met commissioner is not impossible, even though it is beset by political hurdles.</p> <p>To meet the big reduction in government funding, the Met will soon move out of its current headquarters to a new building. It has cut \u00a3600m from its budget and Hogan-Howe, after much deliberation, spoke out against the Conservative government that appointed him.</p> <p>Tensions surfaced recently with Khan, who was elected in May, over the issue of spit hoods, pieces of fabric and mesh placed over detainees\u2019 heads to stop them spitting at or biting officers.</p> <p>Khan put pressure on the Met to reverse a decision to introduce the hoods earlier this month. The Met was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/met-police-to-start-using-spit-hoods-on-suspects-within-weeks\">planning to deploy them in custody areas</a>, but after the Guardian revealed the decision, the mayor\u2019s team was unhappy because it had not been consulted.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe said last week he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/22/met-police-lack-of-sensitivity-spit-hoods-bernard-hogan-howe\">accepted there had been a lack of sensitivity</a> over the decision and regretted that Khan had not been told. The mayor is supposed to oversee the Met, shaping its strategic priorities while not interfering in its operations.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe said: \u201cThis was our decision prior to the mayor and deputy mayor arriving. </p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t raise it with the new mayor or deputy mayor. I\u2019ve already acknowledged that probably, with retrospect, we didn\u2019t anticipate the response because we didn\u2019t think it was such a big issue. But clearly for people it has been.\u201d</p> <p>The official statements announcing his resignation carried no sign of any tension.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe, 58, said: \u201cI came into this job determined to fight crime and make the MPS the best, most professional police service. I wish my successor well as they take on this amazing responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a great privilege to be the Met\u2019s commissioner. I have loved my time in the role and I have loved being a police officer.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan-Howe was hated by some sections of the media for the pursuit of journalists over phone-hacking and bribery claims. He also faced calls to quit over Operation Midland, an inquiry into claims VIPs had abused children decades ago. The operation is alleged to have spiralled out of control and collapsed without unearthing evidence of guilt.</p> <p>Under his tenure the Met successfully policed the 2012 London Olympics, but the officer who actually oversaw that soon left the organisation because Hogan-Howe had a particular vision of whom he wanted in his top team. The Met is also regarded as having done a good job in the face of the heightened terrorist, although the government has considered passing the responsibility to the relatively new National Crime Agency, an idea the Met has so far successfully resisted.</p> <p>Khan praised Hogan-Howe\u2019s record, saying: \u201cBernard oversaw the excellent policing of the 2012 Olympic Games and has taken big steps towards making our police service more representative of London.</p> <p> \u201cI will work closely with the home secretary to ensure we find the best possible candidate to appoint as the new commissioner, so that we can continue to keep Londoners safe.\u201d</p> <p>The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said: \u201cI want to thank Sir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bernard-hogan-howe\">Bernard Hogan-Howe</a> for the leadership he has shown as commissioner, and his work to keep the communities of London safe and the United Kingdom secure against the backdrop of a heightened terror threat. <br></p> <p>\u201cSir Bernard has had a long and distinguished career as a determined crimefighter and an inspirational senior officer. He has shown remarkable and consistent dedication to public service. Among his many achievements in London was the delivery of a safe and successful 2012 Olympics. I am grateful to Sir Bernard for his dedication and support, and look forward to working closely with him until his retirement next year.\u201d</p> <p>Met staff morale hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/07/majority-met-police-officers-not-confident-in-leadership\">record lows</a> in 2014 but the force maintained officer numbers at 32,000 as it restructured and tried to adapt to the changing nature of crime, particularly cyber offences.</p> <p>The last commissioner of the Met to complete their term was Sir John Stevens in 2005.</p> <p>Among those who may apply for the commissioner\u2019s job are Sara Thornton, the current head of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council and former head of the Thames Valley force, bordering London. She was once described as David Cameron\u2019s favourite police chief. Also in the running is Mark Rowley, an assistant commissioner of the Met who oversees counter-terrorism.</p>",

  "<p>I took this photograph about a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/27/new-orleans-hurricane-katrina-10-years-lessons\">Hurricane Katrina</a> in 2005. I don\u2019t normally cover natural disasters, but when I heard that New Orleans was flooded, I started to think this might not be just a natural disaster \u2013 it could be a man-made disaster. I\u2019m from Holland, where a large part of the country is below sea level, so I understood that something else was going on. The photo editor at Time sent me to New Orleans for three days. I was there for three weeks, and returned several times over the years.</p> <p>In New York, I stocked up on camera film and gasoline, which I needed for the drive down and for a generator. When I arrived, New Orleans was still flooded. It was a very sad situation \u2013 many people drowned and others lost everything. When the water slowly started to recede, I wore waders to get around. It was incredible to see a city completely abandoned. </p> <p>This image was taken in the living room of a house in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2014/jan/27/new-orleans-lower-ninth-ward-in-pictures\">Lower Ninth Ward</a>. It was among the most affected areas, because of its low elevation and also because it was a very low-income neighbourhood \u2013 its flood defences were poor. You can see how high the water had risen: it filled the room up to the ceiling. I don\u2019t know what happened to the people who lived there \u2013 when I returned the following year, the house had been knocked down. </p> <p>People thought they were safe because the media was reporting that New Orleans was safe, and then the water came so quickly that houses were abandoned as if everyone was fleeing a war. Pots were still on the stove. Going into those houses felt like you were intruding on somebody\u2019s privacy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/aug/28/hurricane-katrina-scenes-overlaid-in-pictures\">Hurricane Katrina: scenes of destruction 10 years on \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m better at shooting in black and white than in colour. Black and white is about the essentials \u2013 and colour would have distracted from the story I wanted to tell.

There is pride in this image, because of the chandelier, but it is awkward too \u2013 what with all the plants caught in it and the marks on the wall and ceiling. </p> <p>It was great that I was allowed to shoot on film, but a hassle to get the rolls out. I had to find someone who could take them to Baton Rouge to get them shipped to New York, because the airport in New Orleans was closed. I discussed the images over the phone with the magazine because, of course, I couldn\u2019t see them. We had mobile phones and internet, but they were often not working.

  "<p>A teenager has shot and killed his father in rural South Carolina before going to a small elementary school, where he shot a teacher and two children, all three of whom are now hospitalized.

The grandparents could not understand what was going on so they went to the home just 100 yards away. When they got there, they found Osborne had been shot and their grandson was gone.</p> <p>About one minute later, authorities received a 911 call from Townville elementary school.</p> <p>Sheriff John Skipper said the shooter drove a vehicle into the school parking lot and immediately started firing a handgun as he got out and moved toward the school.

  "<p>Turf wars by ministers seeking to control the Brexit negotiations are wasting valuable time and may cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds in additional civil servants, a report by the respected <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/\">Institute for Government</a> claims.<br></p> <p>In the first detailed examination of how Whitehall is being restructured to cope with the Brexit talks, the report says the cost is approaching \u00a365m, largely due to the need to hire 500 extra civil servants.</p> <p>It adds that the triple departmental structure of splitting responsibility \u201crisks creating fragmentation and incoherence.

It says Whitehall\u2019s engagement with outside interests so far has been haphazard and prone to duplication.</p> <p>It adds: \u201cAt the very least, Theresa May needs to clarify the process and timescales though which she intends her government to reach its initial negotiating position\u201d and warns that \u201cin the absence of a clear plan, Kremlinology and off the cuff remarks are filling the void\u201d.</p> <p>The current position of the outside world trying to divine the government\u2019s position from the musing of individual ministers is creating unhelpful uncertainty, frustrating those looking for an early exit, perplexing those with whom we have to negotiate and unsettling those looking to do business with the UK, says the report.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/sep/29/brexit-leave-eu-bigger-government-state-size\">One way or another, Brexit will bump up the size of the state</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The growing assumption in European capitals is that May is determined to deliver on a pledge to bring UK borders back under control; as a result, UK access to the EU single market will be limited.

  "<h2>How did you get started in business?</h2> <p>I had an early interest in entrepreneurship. As a kid, I pretended to be a travel agent and sent fake tickets to my parents; I charged my mum\u2019s friends for terrible manicures; I started a tuck shop in my school and eventually made a profit. It just was in my blood, always.<br></p> <p>It was important to me to earn my own money; I couldn\u2019t wait to get out there. I started my career in advertising very young \u2013 I celebrated my 18th birthday in the office, working full-time. By my early 20s I decided I wasn\u2019t creatively fulfilled and decided to start my own company called Your Local Fair. I staged [craft] events [around London] where I pulled together the best of small businesses from the local area and put them all under one roof. That\u2019s where the idea for Not on the High Street came from, I did exactly the same thing but put it under the internet\u2019s roof.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/jan/15/dyslexic-entrepreneurs-competitive-edge-business-leaders\">Dyslexic entrepreneurs \u2013 why they have a competitive edge</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Do you think having dyslexia has influenced your career?</h2> <p>I think so. I got two As and an E in my A-levels. The As were in creative design and technology and art and the E was in business studies, ironically. It [the dyslexia] wasn\u2019t picked up until later on. But it explains a lot about why I had to work particularly hard to get to the same place as my peers. When you\u2019re faced with challenges down to the basics of reading and writing, it teaches you to find another way around things. Working your creative muscle that way is great for an entrepreneur. </p> <h2>How did your interest in small businesses begin?</h2> <p>It came from my appreciation of creativity and my love of business. I stumbled across the talent of small companies at Your Local Fair and I kept on being bowled over by what they were creating. Your Local Fair progressed and was successful, and I saw that I could have a real effect on small businesses. Then being able to build an [e-commerce] platform that shone a light on this hidden army of people was a great feeling.<br></p> <h2>Did your career in advertising help?</h2> <p>Absolutely. You have to work your butt off in advertising. When I started I was the lowest of the low, and I was put through my paces. Then I became the youngest account manager in London. I was working every hour God sent for four years.<br></p> <p>In advertising you\u2019re dealing with both the client and the customer, which is a real learning curve. That experience was helpful for Not on the High Street where we have two customers, the shopper and the small business. Working in advertising also gave me the ability to read people and situations. I was already a people person, but it really helped to fine-tune those skills.<br></p> <h2>What\u2019s been your proudest moment?</h2> <p>It\u2019s been a 10-year epic journey, so there have been a lot. But I tend to rush through and not really ever take a second to appreciate things. My MBE for services to small businesses and enterprise [Tucker was named in the Queen\u2019s birthday honours in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-queens-birthday-honours-2013\" rel=\"nofollow\">2013</a>] was the only moment that I stopped.<br></p> <p>My partner Frank was there; he had given up his job so that I could continue running Not on the High Street [this helped Tucker to run the company while her son was a baby]. My sister, Carrie, was there, she was employee number three after me and my business partner, Sophie. And my son was there who was just three months old when I started the business. It was definitely the second proudest moment of my life (after giving birth to my son), it really does stick with me.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/14/not-on-the-high-street-founders-interview-holly-tucker-sophie-cornish\">The e-commerce sisters doing it for themselves</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What advice would you give to someone who wants to start a business?</h2> <p>Try and control who you are building the business for. Taking on investment, whatever type of investment that might be, ultimately creates tougher targets for your business that are normally hung on growth. And if you are growing fast, sometimes you are blinkered to what\u2019s going on in your business. Growth is not always the answer and there are always going to be consequences to growth.<br></p> <h2>What have been the toughest moments of your career?</h2> <p>When we were seeking investment in 2006, it was such a different landscape. I think people now are much more savvy. When we did it, women were an absolute minority for raising money.<br></p> <p>The VCs [venture capitalists] we saw didn\u2019t even understand the concept of an online marketplace. The only people out there at the time were Amazon and eBay; [e-commerce business] Etsy started at the same time as us. We went around with our proverbial black suitcase full of personalised T-shirts and beautifully stitched cushions from small businesses, but the audience that we were addressing weren\u2019t our customers. The number of times I heard from investors that their wives did the shopping, so why would they be interested, was astounding.</p> <p>It was with a huge amount of luck that we stumbled across an investor who really understood the female shopper.<br></p> <h2>What\u2019s your role in the business?</h2> <p>I now sit on the board and I\u2019m a non-executive director. I\u2019m in the office a lot and I work with Simon [Belsham, Not on the High Street\u2019s CEO] a lot. There\u2019s no dragging me away from this business as it\u2019s the ultimate thing I\u2019m proud of. </p> <h2>What are your plans for the future?</h2> <p>I\u2019ll continue to be Not on the High Street\u2019s biggest cheerleader \u2013 I am actually, officially, their number one shopper. I\u2019ll continue working on the board and with the brand. My next priority is Holly and Co, which launches in January. It is going to continue my support for small businesses, but I\u2019m not able to say what it is yet. That will be another decade of work that I want to put into the small business community.</p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s a large branch of televisual entertainment that relies on people doing strange and disconcerting things, either as some kind of challenge or ritual humiliation, or as the price you pay for being allowed to call yourself a celebrity when you aren\u2019t really. Then there are those folks who do odd things off their own bat, because they\u2019re odd. You don\u2019t have to give them reasons or offer them money. You just have to find them.</p> <p><strong>World of Weird</strong> (Channel 4) is a&#xa0;series that does just that, and it\u2019s a very sturdy formula. The only possible difficulty its producers might have faced is a global shortage of weirdness, but once they tracked down the man who paints pictures with his penis, I\u2019m sure they felt they were away.</p> <p>Tim Patch \u2013 AKA Pricasso \u2013 lives in Queensland in a house he built himself. He wears an outsize pink top hat and matching bow tie when he works, and not much else. He produces, he reckons, about 1,000 canvases a year, mostly on commission, although success in his particular discipline comes at a&#xa0;price. \u201cI go through a lot of skin,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It has been said that half an hour spent in the company of someone who is good at his job is never wasted. As a&#xa0;corollary to that, I would suggest that 15 minutes spent watching a guy paint with his dick will make you feel a lot better about how you waste your own time, with the possible exception of the preceding 15 minutes.</p> <p>To say that Pricasso paints with his penis isn\u2019t completely accurate; he also paints with his balls and arse. He has a method for doing the canvas edges he calls \u201cthe credit card swipe\u201d that, I&#xa0;must confess, I\u2019m still a little haunted&#xa0;by.</p> <p>Pricasso\u2019s paintings are mostly portraits, either of famous people or paying sitters. The best thing I can say about them is that they\u2019re not bad, considering. Presenter Joel Dommett had a go at producing a still life using only his member, which proved, if nothing else, that it\u2019s harder than it looks. I&#xa0;thank&#xa0;you.</p> <p>World of Weird also turned our jaded attentions to Texan vampire Michael Vachmiel, who is part of a&#xa0;subculture dedicated to combining gothic fashions with total nonsense. The programme claimed there might be as many as 5,000 vampires in the US, although I would suggest the true figure is much closer to zero.</p> <p>Vachmiel calls himself a \u201csanguinarian\u201d, which means he drinks blood. His source \u2013 a \u201cblack swan\u201d in pretend-vampire parlance \u2013 is a 29-year-old woman who goes by the name of Blut Katzchen. It\u2019s a consensual relationship, although it was unclear what she got out of it, and even less clear after she explained. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a spiritual thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an exchange of energy. It\u2019s growing your own energy ... and one of the ways to regrow energy is by giving it out.\u201d I think if that explanation made any more sense it would violate the first law of thermodynamics.</p> <p>One of the pitfalls of televising weird people is that you could end up with people who are just being weird to get on television. Obviously, publicity is a big part of the dick-painting business (as seen on TV!), but I had the feeling that everyone involved in World of Weird would persist with their niche enthusiasms whether or not they attracted wider notice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a1ccc39350ffe55543c89566d81c1129002981d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a1ccc39350ffe55543c89566d81c1129002981d/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackie and Chico the capybara.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackie and Chico the capybara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pro Co/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That might not be true of Jackie from Texarkana, who keeps a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/capybara-captured-toronto-canada-bonnie-clyde\" title=\"\">capybara</a> as a pet. Even as she extolled the joys of having an 8st rat about the house, Jackie seemed to be starting down the long journey toward accepting her mistake. Chico the capybara is ungovernable, prone to escape attempts and occasionally aggressive. \u201cChico doesn\u2019t&#xa0;necessarily like Jeff,\u201d said Jackie, as Chico cornered Jackie\u2019s husband in the kitchen. It was obvious that Jeff didn\u2019t like Chico either. In a&#xa0;few years, Chico will weigh more than Jeff, and Jackie will probably have a&#xa0;choice to make.</p> <p>World of Weird made for an entertaining, if not exactly edifying hour. It has a tolerant, live-and-let live attitude toward its subjects, and it was occasionally very funny.

Border Force staffing has risen since this division of the Home Office was created in 2012.

The UK has 5,000 customs staff and Border Force has 8,000: a very lean operation by international standards.

Administering work permits is going to be complicated under whatever system emerges, and will bring a lot more intervention in firms\u2019 recruitment schemes. Some say policy logic leads back to where former home secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/apr/26/immigrationpolicy.humanrights\">David Blunkett</a> found himself 12 years ago, introducing identity cards \u2013 at a cost then of up to \u00a33.1bn.</p> <p> Theresa May\u2019s line when she was at the Home Office was that visa charges ought to cover the cost of immigration and border control. But today\u2019s gap \u2013 income from visas at \u00a31.3bn and spending at \u00a31.8bn \u2013 can now only grow. </p> <p> Also, migration control is likely to bring more work for the police. That might be impossible with today\u2019s staffing levels: police numbers have been cut by 14% since 2010.</p> <p> Some Leavers were libertarians, claiming that emancipation from the EU would see government further reduced.

  "<p>Until about nine months ago, leaving the European Union was not something that sensible British politicians talked about. They hadn\u2019t, really, since the country entered the bloc in 1973, the year that Theresa May sat her O-levels. In the intervening 43 years, as the EEC became the EU; and Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair came and went; and the Channel Tunnel was dug; and the borders spread to the east; and the euro was launched, and then foundered; our relationship with Brussels seemed, more or less, to embody a settled ambivalence towards the European continent that most British people instinctively recognised as their own. Close, but separate. In, but not integrated. Related, but not the same. We did not learn French.</p> <p>And then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\">17 million people voted to leave</a>. Everyone has their own explanation for why. Not all of them make sense. I found out the other day that my wife\u2019s uncle voted for Brexit because his son is training to be a doctor, and doesn\u2019t like Jeremy Hunt, who campaigned for remain. Victory, as they say, has many fathers. Since 23 June, a great many things have been blamed \u2013 or thanked, depending on your view \u2013 for convincing the population that staying within the European Union was hurting us. Their names are more than familiar now. Nigel Farage. Globalisation. The rightwing press. The left behind. Professional politicians. Absent politicians. The financial crisis. Boris. Migrants. Project Fear. Sunderland. In their own way, and over time, these things helped create the feeling that we were trapped in something so defective, so inimical to our interests, that our best hope was to climb through a high window, and out.</p> <p>But you don\u2019t get to Brexit without someone dreaming up the window \u2013 the remedy of leaving \u2013 in the first place. And during those long years inside the European project, that was the work of the right wing of the Conservative party. To be specific, a small, somewhat esoteric part of that wing: a flash of feathers, almost,<strong> </strong>a sect of true Eurosceptic believers who dreamed and schemed for this moment for the last 25 years. Most worked for little else, with no reward, and with no sign that they would ever prevail. \u201cLike the monks on Iona,\u201d as one of their former parliamentary researchers told me, \u201cilluminating their manuscripts and waiting for the Dark Ages to come to an end.\u201d</p> <p>And no one in that group worked with more devotion than Daniel Hannan, a Conservative member of the European parliament for south-east England. Hannan, who is 45, is by no ordinary measure a front-rank British politician. He has never been an MP, or a minister, or a mayor. Instead, since the age of 19, he has fought for what he calls British independence \u2013 fomenting, protesting, strategising, undermining, writing books, writing speeches and then delivering them without notes. For the last 17 years, Hannan, a spry, fastidious figure, who likes to read Shakespeare once a week, has done this mainly from the other side of the English Channel. He knows what it is to toil for a lost cause. \u201cHere I am, Ishmael,\u201d he told me recently, in his office at the European parliament in Strasbourg, invoking the Old Testament as he gestured around him. \u201cEvery man\u2019s hand is against me.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan may have contributed more to the ideas, arguments and tactics of Euroscepticism than any other individual. It was Hannan, in 2012, who asked Matthew Elliott, the founder of the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, to set up the embryonic campaign group that later became Vote Leave. Elliott, who is 38, describes Hannan as the pamphleteer who made Brexit seem like a reasonable proposition for millions of people. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anybody who has done more on this,\u201d he told me. Others laboured too, of course, and Elliott cited veteran Tory MPs Bill Cash and John Redwood, who spent decades attacking the constitutional and economic aspects of the EU \u2013 \u201cbut Dan is the only person who has successfully created a whole worldview,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also then done better than anyone else to be the propagandist for it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hannan\u2019s signature case against EU membership is an upbeat argument of direct democracy and free-market capitalism. He sidesteps questions about the inevitable trade-offs of leaving by insisting there will be none. Elliott was an intern when he first heard Hannan speak in Westminster almost 20 years ago. Douglas Carswell, the Ukip MP, was convinced by Hannan that Britain should pull out, in the autumn of 1993. \u201cWhen I heard Boris Johnson and all those others making those brilliant points they made,\u201d Carswell told me recently, \u201cI thought, \u2018Compare it to making a film: these guys on the silver screen are brilliant. But the script is written by Hannan, and this is largely a Hannan production.\u2019\u201d Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary, who helped persuade David Cameron to allow his cabinet to campaign freely during the vote, was \u201cradicalised\u201d, in her phrase, by Hannan during her time as an MEP. \u201cOn the morning of 24 June, I texted Dan congratulating him on changing the course of European history.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, Hannan is not a household name. He didn\u2019t break out during the campaign. Fellow Brexiteers told me there were prosaic reasons for this. \u201cThe broadcasters had their own hierarchy for their own reasons,\u201d said Michael Gove. \u201cThey took the view that some people were box-office and some people weren\u2019t.\u201d Besides, to allies and enemies alike, Hannan\u2019s role has never been on centre stage. Trying to characterise his contribution to Brexit, many people I spoke to likened him to dogmatic intellectuals from the past who came first and prepared the way. Admirers mentioned Patrick Henry and Tom Paine, whose writings catalysed the American Revolution. Opponents compared Hannan to Trotsky. \u201cYou have got to have hard arses,\u201d the Marquess of Salisbury, a long-term Eurosceptic and Hannan supporter, told me, \u201cwho are morally courageous, who consistently make the arguments, who don\u2019t mind being unfashionable.\u201d<strong> </strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In his own way, he is an idiot savant.

The final weeks of the Vote Leave campaign, with its focus on immigration and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\">posters about Turkey joining the EU,</a> were like nothing out of a sonorous Hannan speech. (His own 217-page book, Why Vote Leave, contains a single sentence on immigration, and Hannan supports Turkish membership of the bloc, in principle.) In the eyes of Ukip, the narrow, Hannanite case for Brexit \u2013 mostly about deregulation and sovereignty \u2013 was a sideshow next to the real event: a chorus of economic and cultural discontent. \u201cIn his own way, he is an idiot savant,\u201d said Gawain Towler, Nigel Farage\u2019s spokesman. \u201cSo locked up in his world that he can\u2019t see what is on the end of his well-formed aquiline nose.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan himself is almost impossible to pin down on these questions. He is agile and skilful when he talks \u2013 like a star witness with absolutely nothing to hide \u2013 and during several conversations this summer, he showed no anxiety at all about the manner of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU, or the scale of the diplomatic and economic challenges facing the country. Whenever he could, Hannan would muse on the fair-mindedness and natural intelligence of the British people, and spar with the ideas of his many opponents. \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/danieljhannan/status/775996023873429504\">If you\u2019re told that \u2018Brexit was all about immigration,\u2019 you can be almost certain that you\u2019re talking to a Remain voter,</a>\u201d ran a sample, recent tweet.</p> <p>For the rest of us, the patience and ruthlessness of the long-term leavers \u2013 a tiny band, fiddling at the political margins for a quarter of a century \u2013 will always be a breathtaking thing. \u201cIt\u2019s revenge of the nerd,\u201d one current cabinet minister, who voted remain, told me. \u201cI was in awe of it.\u201d But he observed that in all the years of plotting, there had been scant planning for the part that comes next, and no guarantee the agitation will now stop. \u201cNone of these people are builders, they are destroyers,\u201d the minister said. \u201cThey are frightening people. They are like arsonists.\u201d If Hannan has ever felt a moment of fear, or doubt, about his life\u2019s work, you suspect that he will never admit it, even to himself. His term as an MEP runs out in 2019, and he plans to leave politics after that \u2013 the work of a singular, premeditated career complete. \u201cMission accomplie,\u201d Hannan quipped to me, on two separate occasions. \u201cAs we like to say in Brussels.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40e3623ac582e6143c798af55787e54198e6e3c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40e3623ac582e6143c798af55787e54198e6e3c5/0_94_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Hannan reads the Daily Telegraph at the European parliament in Strasbourg, in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Hannan reads the Daily Telegraph at the European parliament in Strasbourg, in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerard Cerles/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Once Britain became part of the European<strong> </strong>Economic Community, the idea of leaving it went away. A few old-stagers from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/from-the-archive-blog/2015/jun/05/referendum-eec-europe-1975\">1975 referendum on membership</a> fought on \u2013 isolated high Tories and leftwingers, like soldiers left behind in the woods \u2013 but the cause was dead. The European project meant cheaper prices in the shops, and its force was unarguable. That began to change in the twilight of the cold war. In 1988, from the great medieval Belfry of Bruges, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1988/sep/21/emu.theeuro\">Margaret Thatcher decried a European superstate</a> on the horizon, with a character and goals that were different from her own. \u201cWe have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level,\u201d she said. The \u201cBruges speech\u201d established a new form of Euroscepticism. It saw a parallel between the disintegrating, clapped-out USSR and the folly of a new federal entity, designed in Brussels. It loved America, and Nato. It wanted a world of liberal nation states. Thatcher was in office to see the Berlin Wall come down. But then, like a confusing, bad dream for her most loyal supporters, she fell, and the Maastricht treaty materialised, with its portents of the euro, political integration and everything that she had warned against.</p> <p>Hannan was part of a particular generation of young Conservatives deeply marked by these events. He was in his first term at Oxford, studying history at Oriel, when Thatcher resigned on 23 November 1990. Twenty-three days later, John Major approved an early draft of Maastricht. The sense of a mighty mistake being made has never left Hannan. By the end of term, he had founded a university society, the Oxford Campaign for an Independent Britain, at the Queen\u2019s Lane cafe on Oxford High Street.</p> <p>\u201cI remember swearing what the old adventure stories would call a terrible oath to do something,\u201d he told me. Hannan had spent the summer travelling through the fragmenting societies of communist eastern Europe. He had seen crowds demanding the return of national borders, languages and flags. His CIB co-founders were another history student, called James Ross, who is now a composer, and Mark Reckless, the former Conservative and then Ukip MP. Hannan and Reckless had been to Marlborough College, in Wiltshire, together. They bumped into each other that summer in Budapest.</p> <p>The CIB came to dominate conservative student politics at Oxford at a time of acute ideological anxiety. Nicky Griffiths, later Morgan, the former education secretary, was a member. \u201cThere were all these countries and societies and economies up for grabs,\u201d she said. Most students were all over the place, figuring out what they believed in, but not Hannan. \u201cHe was clearly the leader,\u201d said Mark Littlewood, the current director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market thinktank. Littlewood was pro-Maastricht and frequently found himself up against the dapper star of the CIB in debates at the Oxford Union. \u201cNightmare,\u201d he told me. Handkerchief in his top pocket, Hannan wiped the floor with all comers, despite having a slightly odd, otherworldly quality. \u201cI mean this in the fondest possible way,\u201d said Littlewood, \u201cyou could almost think, this is someone from a slightly previous age.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d6a129928c4c38ecdfc4af8363d09d8e5c665c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6a129928c4c38ecdfc4af8363d09d8e5c665c5d/0_353_2731_3413/800.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher deliver her \u2018Bruges speech\u2019 in 19xx.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher delivers her \u2018Bruges speech\u2019 in 1988 in which she warned against a European superstate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Naden/PA Archive/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was, in a way. The only child of ageing parents, Hannan was born in Lima, Peru in 1971. He was raised on a poultry farm outside Chaclacayo, not far from the capital. The Hannans, who had come from Lancashire to Latin America after the first world war, were part of a once-prosperous British expat community in the country. But the nation of Hannan\u2019s childhood was destabilised by coups and anticolonial feeling. One of his early memories is of his father, Hugh, frail with illness, facing down a mob who had come to seize the estate.</p> <p>Hannan boarded in the Cotswolds from the age of eight.<strong> </strong>Britain in 1979 was a revelation. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand these adults saying England is finished, going to the dogs,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one in Peru spoke like that.\u201d Ever since, friends and foes have remarked on the power of Hannan\u2019s learnt patriotism. Roger Scruton, the conservative writer and philosopher,<strong> </strong>first met Hannan when he gave a seminar to sixth-formers at Marlborough. \u201cThe expat mentality is belonging to the old country,\u201d Scruton told me, \u201cand the inability to accept that it is changed beyond repair.\u201d</p> <p>At Oxford, Hannan\u2019s screeds on Maastricht quoted Aristotle, Shakespeare and William Pitt the Younger. But he also had an eye for a stunt. Conservative ministers visiting the CIB were ambushed and photographed with anti-EU T-shirts, while Hannan\u2019s speeches \u2013 as his writings are now \u2013 were littered with arch, aphoristic observations. Lord Salisbury was able to run the British empire with 52 civil servants. King\u2019s College, Cambridge, has produced more Nobel prize winners than France. The world\u2019s oldest parliaments all hail from small islands. Goldman Sachs wants you to vote remain. \u201cA Hannan soundbite does stick with you,\u201d said Littlewood. \u201cHe does make you think.\u201d</p> <p>The Eurosceptic heroes of the time were the 22 Conservative MPs who rebelled against the Maastricht bill in May 1992, almost bringing down the government. The following spring, as he was about to graduate, Hannan wrote to them and offered himself as their researcher. Around a dozen agreed to form the European Research Group (ERG), with Hannan as its secretary.</p> <p>In Westminster, the ERG was part of a lattice of energetic, new anti-EU organisations, such as Patrick Robertson\u2019s Bruges Group, and Bill Cash\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.europeanfoundation.org/\">European Foundation</a>. Hannan joined the young activists who staffed the offices and wrote the pamphlets. He and Reckless, who was then working as an economist at SG Warburg investment bank, shared a flat above the John Snow pub in Soho. They hung a huge Union Jack over the fire escape, threw parties and believed they were on to something much bigger and more alive than keeping a fading government in power. \u201cDon\u2019t ever make the mistake of thinking Dan was a young fogey,\u201d said Douglas Carswell, who met Hannan while he was on work experience in the Commons that year. \u201cThis was a radicalised streak of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>The job of the ERG was to keep the European debate alive, and to make contact with like-minded campaigners across the continent. But Hannan and his group also consciously sought to bend the Conservative party to their thinking. \u201cFor us the EU was the litmus test for the generation above us,\u201d Reckless told me. After the defeat to Labour in 1997, they attached themselves to Michael Howard as the most Eurosceptic candidate to lead the Conservatives. Gove, who was writing for the Times, remembers meeting Hannan, who was supplying lines and jokes for Howard to use in the House of Commons, that summer. \u201cHe was very, very clear-minded and clear-sighted,\u201d Gove told me. \u201cSome people find certainty attractive. Other people find it unsettling.\u201d Hannan was 24 years old.</p> <p>For all its fervour, though, Euroscepticism in the late 1990s could not have been more unfashionable. New Labour was ascendant, and openly intent on deeper integration with the EU. In the summer of 1998, Tony Blair praised the incoming single currency and the prospect of Britain adopting the euro became the next line of battle in the European debate. The ERG published a paper, The Euro: bad for business, written by Reckless, and Hannan organised two conferences on the subject before helping to establish Business for Sterling, a single-issue pressure group to fight what was, at the time, a widely expected referendum.</p> <p>Largely forgotten now, Business for Sterling set the template, and included some of the key personnel, for the 2016 leave campaign. (Vote Leave\u2019s initial vehicle, Business for Britain, was named in homage.) Although the group was chaired by Tory rebels and right-leaning grandees \u2013 led by Rodney Leach, a merchant banker, who later became a lord; Rupert Hambro, of Hambros Bank, and the Marquess of Salisbury \u2013 it was outwardly cross-party and apolitical. \u201cBusiness for Sterling were the first campaign to sort of bring those concerns out of the political margins and into the real mainstream,\u201d Theresa Villiers told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d/72_0_3474_4342/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings, the man who came up with the slogan \u2018take back control\u2019, in 2001.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings, the man who came up with the slogan \u2018take back control\u2019, in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nick Herbert, who had run the Countryside Alliance, was in charge. (This year, Herbert, who is now an MP, led the Conservative campaign for remain.) He hired a brilliant young campaign director, a former investment analyst, whose last job had been in Russia, called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/accuracy-is-for-snake-oil-pussies-vote-leaves-campaign-director-defies-mps\">Dominic Cummings</a>. Hannan was by now flitting back and forth between the ERG and his job writing leaders for the Daily Telegraph. He thought about how to frame the European question for a national audience. \u201cThis was when I started realising how much the mechanics of a campaign matter,\u201d he told me. \u201cSimply by talking about keeping the pound rather than opposing the euro, we added 15 points.\u201d</p> <p>Business for Sterling recruited Bob Geldof, Vic Reeves and thousands of students to its cause. It helped keep opinion polls set against joining the Euro and deterred the new Labour government, and its pro-European allies in the City, at their moment of peak of popular influence. Hannan and Cummings and the rest of the new crowd \u2013 all in their 20s \u2013 came away with their first victory scars against the establishment. \u201cWe did feel that bonding that comes from a ridiculed minority,\u201d said Hannan.</p> <p>Eighteen years later, many of Business for Sterling\u2019s funders and supporters gathered to the flag again. Villiers was one of many long-term Eurosceptic campaigners who realised that, although they were underdogs, they had fought a version of this battle before. \u201cIt is funny,\u201d she told me. \u201cAlmost at every point I assumed remain would win. But it certainly did occur to me the disadvantage they had was they had been thinking about this referendum for possibly a year. Whereas people like Dan, it has been their life\u2019s work. The whole of their adult working life had been building to this moment.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Business for Sterling succeeded because it found language and symbols \u2013 the Queen\u2019s head on a fiver \u2013 that touched the nerves of millions of people.<strong> </strong>Pulling out of the EU was a different ball game. There was no word for Brexit in the 1990s. Even Eurosceptic MPs didn\u2019t mention it as an option. The language of choice for Tory rebels was of \u201creform\u201d; \u201cfundamental reform\u201d if they were feeling brave. \u201cWhatever weasel words,\u201d Reckless told me. \u201cDan and I were always clear that our objective was leaving the EU, and that was what we were working towards.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan was one of the first elected British politicians to suggest the idea publicly. In the spring of 1998, believing a referendum on the euro was imminent, he began to look for a seat in the European parliament. Tory MEPs were among the most ardent pro-Europeans in the party, and it seemed like a logical, if audacious, place to take the fight. Hannan\u2019s age \u2013 he was now 26 \u2013 and his polished,<strong> </strong>bracing stump speech marked him out from the other candidates. \u201cI was saying we should take powers back and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to come out if we can\u2019t,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Conservative party activists loved it, but Hannan\u2019s bold language alarmed party headquarters. <strong>\u201c</strong>I was told that he was a fanatic,\u201d said Edward McMillan-Scott, the leader of the Tory bloc of MEPs at the time. McMillan-Scott tried to sabotage Hannan\u2019s campaign, and the young candidate was questioned furiously at an open primary at the London Arena in May. But the ploy backfired. Hannan delighted the crowd again, and the following summer, he was elected to the European parliament as a Conservative candidate for the south-east.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Spanish, we don\u2019t have these imperial dreams. We are realistic. There is something in his life that affected him</p> <footer> <cite>Antonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once inside the heart of the EU, Hannan set about discrediting it. A former researcher in his office told me that duties were divided between responding to constituents and \u201cthe more naughty stuff\u201d of seeking out waste and hypocrisy in Brussels for Hannan\u2019s column in the Sunday Telegraph. Hannan fell out with most of his Conservative party colleagues when he wrote about the expenses they were able to claim,<strong> </strong>but he did not relent. \u201cI was building a campaign to delegitimise the institution,\u201d he said. In the plenary chamber, Hannan used his allotted speaking time to rail against the statist, Bonapartist European project. Fellow MEPs, particularly from abroad, listened to Hannan\u2019s ornate rhetoric in bewilderment and dismay. \u201cThe Spanish, we don\u2019t have these imperial dreams to go back to. We are realistic,\u201d Antonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White, an MEP from Spain\u2019s conservative Partido Popular, told me. \u201cThere is something in his life that probably affected him.\u201d</p> <p>From day one in Brussels, Hannan also sought to bring the Tories out of their moderate grouping, the European People\u2019s party, or EPP, and to ally them with more critical, anti-EU voices in the European parliament. Since 1979, the party had sat alongside fellow centre-right parties from countries such as Germany and Spain. But hardline Eurosceptics believed that this meant that Tory MEPs absorbed the meeker, pro-European tendencies of their continental colleagues. At first Hannan simply sat alone. But after six years of hectoring and arguing, and as new, Eurosceptic Conservative candidates were elected, he moved the entire bloc to his position. In 2005, Hannan extracted a promise from David Cameron \u2013 then a leadership contender \u2013 that the Tories would leave the EPP. In 2009, they did. (McMillan-Scott was driven out of the party.)</p> <p>Concentrating on arcane goals such as breaking up the EPP was a telltale move of the hardcore Eurosceptics. Another inch gained. Another bolt loosened. \u201cOur goal in politics should not be to get the right people in,\u201d Hannan told me once, paraphrasing Milton Friedman, the American free-market economist. \u201cIt should be to set the incentives so that even the wrong people will do the right things.\u201d But behaving like this, and working to another order of events, separated Hannan and the other Maastricht diehards \u2013 even from fellow Tories who might otherwise agree with them. \u201cThe view at the centre was these were the people who had kept the Conservative party out of power for years,\u201d said Gove. \u201cWhatever they are most passionately in favour of must perforce be at best eccentric, at worst electoral disaster.\u201d</p> <p>One new MP in 2005 remembered being lobbied to support the move out of the EPP and asking an older colleague for advice. \u201cHe said, \u2018You just cannot. It looks good. But you cannot give an inch to these guys because they will never, ever accept it. They will take and take and take until they have won.\u2019\u201d Several Conservative MPs I spoke to for this article compared Hannan and his set to \u201centryists\u201d and \u201cTrots\u201d for their ideological purity, their quest to reassert what they regard as Britain\u2019s lost place in the world. \u201cThey are grammar-school imperialists,\u201d one MP told me. \u201cA hundred years ago Hannan and his ilk would have been able to vent their rather bizarre beliefs bullying people in a nether-province of India.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan says such insults have never bothered him. \u201cIt passes by as the idle wind that I respect not,\u201d he said. He simply regards himself as a different kind of a politician. \u201cI think public life for me has a slightly didactic role, OK,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be trying to shift the centre ground of public opinion.\u201d Since becoming an MEP, Hannan has written six books, from polemics, such as The New Road to Serfdom, a critique of America\u2019s \u201cEuropean\u201d drift under President Obama; to historical homilies such as How We Invented Freedom &amp; Why It Matters, a 400-page exploration of the genius of English liberty, tracing its origins back to Anglo-Saxon witans and the Magna Carta.</p> <p>Operating apart, however, means that Hannan can sound alarmingly unlike most other British politicians. How We Invented Freedom includes a long extract from a speech made by Enoch Powell on St George\u2019s Day, 1961. Another devout Eurosceptic, Powell eulogised the English language that day as \u201ctuned already to songs that haunt the hearer like the sadness of spring\u201d. The one-time health minister is now remembered for his \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech of 1968, but Hannan frequently cites Powell as the model of the opinion-forming politician he would like to be, describing him, when we spoke, as the \u201csupreme exemplar of that in his generation\u201d.</p> <p>For years, within the Tory party, Hannan was also notorious for helping to write <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/04/conservatives.speeches\">William Hague\u2019s so-called \u201cforeign land\u201d speech </a>in 2001. The speech\u2019s attacks on Europe and tough line on asylum seekers were perceived as racist, and it is still regarded as a nadir in the party\u2019s recent political messaging. But when we talked about the speech this summer, Hannan said: \u201cThere is sort of a hobbit-like element to a lot of British people. They don\u2019t want to be told something until they have worked it out for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Still, there were times when the road seemed so long, and so hard, that Hannan despaired. In 2005, the EU seemed to defy referendums in both France and the Netherlands, where voters rejected a new constitution for the bloc, by repackaging the proposed reforms and forcing them through under a new name: the Lisbon treaty. Hannan wondered whether the whole project was in fact unstoppable. \u201cThey\u2019ll do it all by stealth,\u201d he thought, \u201cand they will get to where they want to go.\u201d<strong> </strong>Cameron\u2019s new-look party was determined \u201cto stop banging on about Europe\u201d and Hannan came close to joining Ukip. In 2007 and 2008, he met Farage several times to discuss his defection, but in the end, the Tories broke with the EPP, and he stayed with the Tories.</p> <p>In November 2009, though, the Conservatives abandoned their own manifesto promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Hannan called Cameron\u2019s office to resign from his duties in Brussels \u2013 he was the party\u2019s legal affairs spokesman in Europe. A senior aide picked up the phone. \u201cI said \u2026 I just think you\u2019ve made the most terrible mistake,\u201d Hannan recalled. But he promised to step down without publicity. The adviser thanked him, and asked Hannan what he planned to do next. \u201cI\u2019m going to devote myself full time to securing and then winning a referendum on leaving the EU,\u201d Hannan replied. The aide laughed down the line. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a5f2d8db8bf0e04c7ca8ce5f2ac657283e5888d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a5f2d8db8bf0e04c7ca8ce5f2ac657283e5888d/0_0_3228_1936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan in 2009.

He was in his office in Brussels. The Macauley poem, Horatius at the Bridge, entered his mind: \u201cWho will stand on either hand / And keep the bridge with me?\u201d He thought of Carswell and Reckless, his closest friends in politics, whom he spoke to almost every day. (Reckless became a Conservative MP a few months later.) Then Hannan ran through his old, Eurosceptic allies. He ended up in touch with the Democracy Movement, a descendant of James Goldsmith\u2019s Referendum party, which had entered candidates in the 1997 election. At the time, the Democracy Movement had its own plan to bring about an in-out referendum in the UK, which was called the People\u2019s Pledge.</p> <p>Like other successful Eurosceptic campaigns, the People\u2019s Pledge was scrupulously cross-party \u2013 it had mainly Labour staffers \u2013 and didn\u2019t make the mistake of asking for too much. The premise was simple: it identified Labour and Conservative MPs under pressure from Ukip in their constituencies, and asked them to publicly support a referendum on the EU. The People\u2019s Pledge launched in March 2011. By October, there was a petition signed by 100,000 people, a debate in parliament and 81 MPs signed up, more and less against their will. Hannan spoke at rallies and impressed donors.</p> <p>Europe was the last thing that the Conservative-led coalition government wanted to address. There was so much else to attend to. The economy. Public service reform. The big society. \u201cOh God, so annoying,\u201d is how a former Cameron adviser described the pressure from the Eurosceptics. \u201cConstantly demanding to see the prime minister.\u201d Gove, then education secretary, felt particularly torn whenever the subject came up. The tactics of the People\u2019s Pledge, and Hannan\u2019s role in it, made many of his colleagues uneasy. On the substance of the argument, however, Gove sided with the young speechwriter he had met in the 1990s. \u201cMore and more of what Dan said, I would find myself agreeing with,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I tried not to think about it whenever possible.\u201d</p> <p>With the eurozone in crisis, and signs of support for a referendum from Labour, the pressure grew. In March 2012, Boris Johnson signed the People\u2019s Pledge. Six months later, a rebellion masterminded by Reckless defeated the government over its contribution to the EU budget. Cameron was cornered, and announced the planned referendum at Bloomberg\u2019s London headquarters the following January. Like George Osborne, Gove argued against it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think offering the referendum was a good idea,\u201d he told me. \u201cI thought, This is being offered as a stopgap, not as a carefully considered recalibration of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. It is more about dealing with an immediate political dilemma.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/brexit-how-a-fringe-idea-took-hold-tory-party\">Brexit: how a fringe idea took hold of the Tory party | Matthew d\u2019Ancona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By then, the skeleton of the leave campaign was already in place. In August 2012, Elliott and Hannan had been invited to spend the weekend at the country house of Lord Leach \u2013 the former chair of Business for Sterling, who died 11 days before the referendum \u2013 on the Norfolk coast. Over the years, Leach had become more or less neutral on the EU question, and he had arranged a house party to discuss possible options for a referendum. Of the group, Hannan and Elliott were the most doubtful of Cameron\u2019s ability to reform the EU.</p> <p>\u201cDan was basically, \u2018He is not going to do it. Don\u2019t believe him,\u201d Elliott recalled. In the garden, Hannan urged Elliott to start thinking about what a Brexit campaign might look like. A year earlier, Elliott had run the winning \u201cno\u201d side of the referendum on the alternative vote with a message that had impressed Hannan with its bloodymindedness. Rather than engaging with the principles at stake, Elliott had focused on the cost of changing the voting system \u2013 an impressive-sounding \u00a3250m \u2013 and sent dustbin trucks apparently heaped with money through the streets of Westminster.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was the most rubbish argument ever,\u201d Hannan said.<strong> </strong>But it worked. Behind in the polls at the start, \u201cNo to A/V\u201d won with 67% of the vote. Elliott had also proved adept at bringing rightwing donors and thinkers to what was a dry, democratic exercise. Leach had chaired the campaign. While Crispin Odey, a hedge fund manager who later contributed more than \u00a3650,000 to pro-leave groups, chipped in \u00a320,000. (In the run up to the vote, Odey bought gold and bet against house-building companies. On 24 June, as the pound collapsed, he made around \u00a3220m. \u201cCrispin,\u201d as a friend told me, \u201chas the common touch of a Medici.\u201d)</p> <p>The new campaign took its playbook from Business for Sterling. Elliott used the initial vehicle, Business for Britain, to set about winning friends and funding from the City. At the same time, he pondered the looming, awkward alliance with Ukip and more protectionist, anti-immigrant strains of anti-EU thinking. \u201cWe needed each other,\u201d he told me. Based on the 2014 European election results, Elliott reckoned that the Ukip vote would be worth around 30% in the referendum. The job of Vote Leave would be to win the centre ground with a reassuring, forward-looking tone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a28eb54e4ebe706d764066461832ed76d88f3f30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a28eb54e4ebe706d764066461832ed76d88f3f30/0_133_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless \u2013 Hannan\u2019s closest friends in politics \u2013 celebrate Reckless\u2019s byelection win for Ukip in 2014.

Dan in a sense provided us with that message.\u201d Elliott hired Cummings, as campaign director, who coined the all-important slogan, \u201cTake Back Control\u201d, while the deliberately crude figure of \u00a3350m per week, to describe Britain\u2019s EU budget contribution, echoed Elliott\u2019s successful A/V strategy.</p> <p>Hannan worked the political side. In the autumn of 2014, his allies Carswell and Reckless left the Tory backbenches for Ukip \u2013 one month apart \u2013 in synchronised defections designed to keep up the pressure on Cameron for a referendum, and, in theory anyway, dilute Nigel Farage\u2019s dominance of the party.<strong> </strong>A year later, as the vote approached, and Cameron began his doomed renegotiation, Hannan reached out to Gove, Johnson, Villiers and others. \u201cI spoke to Boris and made my pitch,\u201d Hannan said. \u201cThe only thing I will say is that he was obviously agonising about the issues.\u201d (Johnson did not respond to a request to comment for this article.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At least three of Gove\u2019s memorable soundbites \u2013 including people being \u2018fed up with experts\u2019 \u2013 were thought up by Hannan</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the time the actual campaign was under way, Hannan\u2019s work was more or less done. \u201cTwenty years of inch-by-inch, person-by-person, converting those in the Conservative party to his vision,\u201d said Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs. Hannan went to Vote Leave\u2019s weekly strategy meeting, chaired by Gove, but his biggest impact on the national debate was probably subliminal. \u201cDan would often express views that I had myself,\u201d said Gove, \u201cwhich he would present in a crisper, more elegant and more coherent way.\u201d At least three of Gove\u2019s more memorable soundbites \u2013 about people being fed up with experts, joking about British MEPs losing their jobs, and comparing pro-remain economists to Nazi scientists \u2013 were Hannan lines.<strong> </strong>Villiers borrowed freely from her friend\u2019s speeches. From needling and courting one or two \u201couters\u201d in the late 1990s, Hannan watched 137 Conservative MPs announce their support for Brexit.</p> <p>He took part in 104 events and debates during the campaign, giving his final speech at Runnymede, where Magna Carta was agreed in 1215. He spent the night of the vote in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters, next door to Lambeth Palace, with Cummings and the rest of the team. (Elliott was in Birmingham.) There was no party planned. \u201cDominic is very puritan about these things,\u201d said Hannan. When victory was certain, Hannan stood on a desk in the office and delivered the St Crispin\u2019s Day speech from Henry V \u2013 \u201cWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers\u201d \u2013 substituting the names of people who had worked on the campaign. He didn\u2019t go to bed until midnight the following day.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On the Monday after the vote, at around six o\u2019clock in the evening, Matthew Parris, the conservative columnist, found himself standing a few feet away from Hannan on College Green, outside the Houses of Parliament. Hannan was having an argument, on air, with Christiane Amanpour of CNN. When the fall of Cameron consumed other senior figures from Vote Leave, Hannan became uneasy about the way that Brexit was being reported, particularly abroad. \u201cThe story taking shape was that Britain had just voted, as it were, for Donald Trump,\u201d he told me. Hannan took on as many interviews as he could, to put across a more positive interpretation of events, but he often found himself under hostile questioning. With Amanpour, he lost his temper. \u201cYou guys have been shouting \u2018racist\u2019 for so long,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cthat you weren\u2019t listening to what we were actually saying.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivOOM0PbNps\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ivOOM0PbNps?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Christiane Amanpour interviews Daniel Hannan</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even by the standards of those numbing, chaotic days, Parris was taken aback by the ferocity of the encounter. \u201cHe was very uncomfortable and very angry,\u201d Parris told me. He has known Hannan since the mid-1990s, and later accused him in the Spectator of being willing to exploit xenophobia in order to pursue his own, more abstract goals. <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/for-the-first-time-in-my-life-i-feel-ashamed-to-be-british/\">\u201cHe has ridden a tiger, and knows the tiger he rides,\u201d Parris wrote.</a> \u201cI find him a bit scary,\u201d he said, when we spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t think he sees himself in politics to give effect to what the public thinks, but to what the public ought to think, which is quite different.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan, naturally, cannot bear this kind of talk. When we first met, in Strasbourg, in early July, I asked him whether he really believed that the nation had voted for his free-market, internationalist version of Brexit. \u201cCan you see how patronising that is?\u201d he replied. \u201cI mean, remainers are saying basically, \u2018These thicko, working-class bigots weren\u2019t listening to you. And let me now tell you \u2013 having ignored them \u2013 let me tell you what they really think.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Hannan spoke of polls that showed that sovereignty was the primary concern of leave voters, rather than immigration, and of the economic shock that had not come. He admitted that because of the closeness of the vote, we were unlikely to become the \u201coffshore, low-tax, global free-trading entrep\u00f4t\u201d that he longs us to be. Hannan\u2019s chosen Brexit would be rather soft, by current standards: something along Swiss lines, with opt-ins for various sectors to the regulations of the single market.<strong> </strong>He believes that compromise on free movement is possible, and that the Swiss government was making progress on the subject until talks were shut down before the British referendum. There is precedent, he pointed out, in his Hannanite way: EU immigration to Liechtenstein is capped at 71 people per year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/how-remain-failed-inside-story-doomed-campaign\">How remain failed: the inside story of a doomed campaign | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It all sounded so reasonable when he talked which, of course, is Hannan\u2019s gift. \u201cEven if you fundamentally disagree with him, you find yourself nodding along,\u201d said Nicky Morgan. Like other senior politicians who campaigned for remain, she disagrees with Hannan\u2019s analysis of what drove the result, and is anxious about the future. \u201cI think we are in the calm before the storm,\u201d she said. Morgan has been called a traitor twice in her constituency of Loughborough, and has heard calls for the removal of a Polish community that has been there since the second world war. She didn\u2019t hear much about free trade and parliamentary supremacy in May and June. \u201cTalking to people who voted leave \u2026 \u2018back\u2019 was a very important word. One of the most depressing things was this, \u2018I want to take our country back.\u2019 Back to what?\u201d</p> <p>Nigel Farage has his own reasons for disagreeing with Hannan. The two have not spoken since 2014. (Farage says the two fell out over his approach to immigration; Hannan says that Farage underwent \u201ca personality change\u201d.) We met recently, in Westminster. The celebratory moustache was gone. He was just back from the US, where he had addressed a Trump rally in Mississippi, and was smoking on the patio. He had been thinking about the similarities between the core Brexit vote, and Trump\u2019s supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not the have-nothings \u2026 They have got something, but they are concerned about the change in society,\u201d he said. \u201cThe basic feeling is that something has gone wrong; that we are not in control; that our political class aren\u2019t the same as us, are detached from us.\u201d</p> <p>Like Hannan, Farage started out making a case for why Britain should leave the European Union \u2013 around trade and sovereignty and democracy \u2013 in the early 1990s. But he realised that the argument only went so far. \u201cIt\u2019s just not what most people are bothered about,\u201d he said. The mystery, for Farage, is that Hannan and his group have never figured this out. \u201cIt\u2019s cultural,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seemed to approach the referendum as if it was an Oxford Union debate. I don\u2019t think they have met any real people in their entire lives.\u201d Farage said he didn\u2019t hear much about Hannan\u2019s free-market, open ideals on the doorstep either. \u201cIt is another disconnect isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Is it possible for someone to crave something for so long, and then be deluded about why it happened? To strive and strive, only for the country to fall into a different, meaner, poorer future? I once asked Hannan why he had dedicated his life to getting us out of the European Union. \u201cIt was the independence issue,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt was the idea of self-government.\u201d I told him that \u2013 as a citizen of the same country \u2013 I still didn\u2019t really get it. I couldn\u2019t see the freer land that he was seeking, even now that we had cut ourselves adrift. \u201cIt\u2019s a big philosophical difference,\u201d said Hannan. \u201cBetween the mentality of the powerful bloc run by competent, educated people and the mentality of \u2018trust the people\u2019.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to be rude. \u201cWe are all conditioned by outlook, experience, genes, whatever. Two people will very often look at the same thing and have very different takes on it.\u201d</p> <p>We were on a train back to London, in late August. Hannan had just spoken at a Conservative club lunch in Worthing, on the south coast, where he was the guest of honour. The lunch had been held in a small hotel. More than a hundred had turned out, a swirl of floral prints and club ties. I sat on Hannan\u2019s table, where he remarked, thought-provokingly, on the scale of British immigration to Spain. \u201cIt is the great migration of our time,\u201d said Hannan, pointing out that there were more British people in Spain than people of Pakistani origin in the UK. \u201cHow many of them are on benefits?\u201d, one woman, in curls, asked promptly. Hannan ate his roast beef, smiled, and did not reply.</p> <p>After lunch, he rose to speak. The Olympics had just finished, and someone gave Hannan a homemade medal for his work on Brexit. The MEP thanked the room for putting him out of a job. The microphone wasn\u2019t working, but he did not need it. With his voice high and precisely cadenced, Hannan spoke of his hopes for the years to come. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that hard.\u201d And he exhorted the audience to remember great British achievements: the medals table, and two wars against German tyranny, the abolition of slavery. \u201cThe idea that we can\u2019t now make a success of living under our own laws, trading with our friends and allies on every continent, while governing ourselves, is not worthy of a country like this one.\u201d Hannan paused. \u201cCheer up my friends.\u201d The lunchers laughed. Sunshine poured in. The cataclysm could not be felt. \u201cListen to the drone of the bees in lavender, and ask yourself where in the world would you rather be?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2016.

But his supporters argue that his victory among members and registered supporters has earned him the right to carry his package into an election. <br></p> <p>The speech was in stark contrast to that delivered by the deputy leader, Tom Watson, on Tuesday in which he urged delegates to stop \u201ctrashing the record\u201d of Blair and Gordon Brown \u2013 and argued that capitalism is not the enemy. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/29/steve-bell-labour-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson-john-lennon-yoko-ono-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/555nc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2759898\"            data-video-name=\"Imagine: Steve Bell draws Corbyn and Watson as John and Yoko \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ecb846e4b0c6325341f1d9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/29/160929CorbynBellSpeech2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/29/160929CorbynBellSpeech2_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/29/160929CorbynBellSpeech2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/29/steve-bell-labour-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson-john-lennon-yoko-ono-video\">Imagine: Steve Bell draws Corbyn and Watson as John and Yoko \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In his speech, Corbyn seemed to counter Watson\u2019s point. He said: \u201cThe global banking crash is an object lesson of out-of-control greed and speculation that crashed economies across the globe and required the biggest ever government intervention and public bailout in history.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn used his speech to pay tribute to Labour MP Jo Cox, who was killed outside her constituency office, and address the spate of abuse and hate that he called \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d.<br></p> <p>The Labour leader then provided his strongest response yet on the issue of antisemitism, describing it as \u201cevil\u201d and as having led to the worst crimes of the 20th century. \u201cThis party always has and always will fight against prejudice and hatred of Jewish people with every breath in its body,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, the comments came as Momentum\u2019s vice chair, Jackie Walker, came under pressure to resign after she incorrectly criticised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/holocaust\">Holocaust</a> Memorial Day at a party antisemitism training session for commemorating only Jewish victims.</p> <p>Walker took issue with the definition of antisemitism used at the training event, which was organised for members at the party conference by the Jewish <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> Movement (JLM).</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of Holocaust day, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if Holocaust day was open to all people who experienced Holocaust?\u201d she told organisers, heard in a recording of the event.<br></p> <p>Holocaust Memorial Day is intended to commemorate all victims of the Nazi Holocaust, and other genocides, including atrocities in Bosnia and Rwanda.</p> <p>After shouts from participants, Walker said that was not how she viewed the event. \u201cIn practice, it\u2019s not actually circulated and advertised as such,\u201d she said. \u201cI was looking for information and I still haven\u2019t heard a definition of antisemitism that I can work with.\u201d</p> <p>She later said in a statement: \u201cI would never play down the significance of the Shoah. Working with many Jewish comrades, I continue to seek to bring greater awareness of other genocides, which are too often forgotten or minimised. If offence has been caused, it is the last thing I would want to do and I apologise.\u201d </p> <p>Walker, who is an old friend of Corbyn\u2019s, was previously suspended from the Labour party after posting during a Facebook discussion that Jews were \u201cchief financiers of the sugar and slave trade\u201d and arguing \u201cthe Jewish Holocaust does not allow Zionists to do what they want\u201d. She was readmitted to the party after an investigation.</p> <p>Corbyn used the speech to stamp down his authority by offering no apology for his pro-immigration stance.</p> <p>Faced with criticism from Labour colleagues who believe he is offering the wrong response to the Brexit vote, he said: \u201cIt isn\u2019t migrants that drive down wages ... It isn\u2019t migrants who put a strain on our NHS ... It isn\u2019t migrants that have caused a housing crisis.\u201d</p> <p>MP Stephen Kinnock MP said the speech was strong on the economy and innovation but added: \u201cThe challenge now is to do more to reassure the British people that Labour is strong on defence and security, and we must also develop policies on immigration that better reflect people\u2019s very real and legitimate concerns about free movement.\u201d <br></p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s speech drew an end to the conference, which began with him securing 61.8% of the vote in his battle with Owen Smith. </p>",

But while the Australian Consumer Law protects consumers against unsolicited calls in some circumstances, there is an exemption for charities where there is an \u201cexisting relationship\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/09/coalition-set-to-abandon-plans-to-scrap-charities-regulator\">Coalition set to abandon plans to scrap charities regulator</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This has created a lucrative incentive for some for call companies to aggressively target consumers.</p> <p>\u201cCalls asking for money are intrusive and put vulnerable members of society at risk when they are hounded week-in and week-out,\u201d said a Choice spokesman, Tom Godfrey. </p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately consumers can\u2019t use the Do Not Call register to opt out of all nuisance calls, with for-profit companies\u2019 call centres exploiting the charity exception to hound people.<br></p> <p>\u201cOf course charities need to be able to raise funds to survive, but when the nature of the fundraising verges on harassment, it bad for the charities and the community they are set up to serve.\u201d</p> <p>The National Seniors chief executive officer, Dagmar Parsons, also expressed concern, and said older Australians were upset about the level of harassment they received.</p> <p>\u201cWe are hearing from our members that the calls are making them anxious and they are reluctant to answer the phone,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Choice report found that although the consumer law protections were effective, the exemptions meant they were \u201cnot strong enough to deal with consumer frustration caused by unwanted calls\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe rate of unsolicited calls, largely due to exceptions to the Do Not Call register for charities and organisations that consumers have an \u2018existing relationship\u2019 with, means that consumers are hounded with calls that they don\u2019t want to receive, and are being asked for money they did not proactively choose to give,\u201d it found.</p> <p>\u201cCommercial companies acting on behalf of charities have at times demonstrated a ruthlessness and disregard for consumers, sometimes for the very consumers they are collecting funds to assist.\u201d</p> <p>A number of case studies in the report outlined a high level of frustration. </p> <p>\u201cSince we have retired we have been inundated with these calls almost on a daily basis, despite registering with the government site to stop these type of calls \u2026 We are seriously thinking of disconnecting our landline,\u201d one participant said.</p> <p>Another said: \u201cI have had to give up answering my landline, and in so doing have missed some important personal calls.\u201d</p> <p>The report acknowledged that charities provided important functions across the country, the \u201cintrinsic social value of the not-for-profit sector should not be used to dissuade policy makers from making changes that are, on the whole, beneficial for society and which are designed to protect the most vulnerable\u201d.</p> <p>Less than 6% of reported income from charities in 2014 was from donations, a smaller amount of which would be from phone donation calls, the report said.</p> <p>The Choice report canvassed removing the exception for charities for the Do Not Call register. </p> <p>It also suggested an alternative that would allow the Do Not Call register to have specific categories for opting out of calls.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, consumers should be able to opt out of all requests for money including fundraising and telemarketing,\u201d it said.</p>",

The suits also allege that the city was told about Gonsalves\u2019s behavior and did nothing.

That suit was settled. Both suits allege that the city was told about Gonsalves\u2019s behavior but failed to act to stop him. </p> <p>The August complaint was filed supplementally against Gonsalves and also against the city of El Cajon for failure to prevent Gonsalves\u2019s harassment and for retaliation Greer experienced after the first suit. The second suit also alleges that Gonsalves did all of this despite knowing that Greer was \u201ca sexual assault survivor who suffered from PTSD\u201d.</p> <p>According to court documents, Olango came to the US from Uganda with his family as refugees in 1991, when he was 12. The family then settled in California.<br></p> <p>Agnes Hassan, a refugee from Sudan, told reporters that she and Olango had been in a refugee camp together. \u201cWe suffered so much with the war in Africa, we come here to suffer again,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Both the El Cajon police department and the El Cajon police officers\u2019 association, the police union, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>",
  "<p>Who would distrust <a href=\"http://judithlight.com/\">Judith Light</a>? With her trim frame and patrician looks, she seems a living synonym for confidence and poise. Her elegant authority is used to fine and sly effect in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/18/neil-labute-im-a-relatively-nice-person-interview\">Neil LaBute</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.mcctheater.org/shows/16-17_season/all-the-ways-to-say-i-love-you/index.html\">All the Ways to Say I Love You</a>, elevating a mildly sensational monodrama into a reasonably compelling character study. <br></p> <p> Light\u2019s Mrs Johnson, an English teacher and occasional guidance counselor, is discovered in her drab office. The piles of books and folders that overwhelm most surfaces are the first indication that Mrs Johnson might not be as self-possessed as she seems. There are pauses in her careful speech and a certain recursiveness in her rhetoric, as though she\u2019s circling around thoughts she\u2019d rather not articulate. Though she recommends herself as a truthful woman \u2013 the word \u201ctruth\u201d occurs a dozen times in her speech, \u201cfact\u201d and \u201chonestly\u201d also turn up often \u2013 it becomes clear that she lies to her husband, to her lover, to herself. </p> <p> All the Ways to Say I Love You would be a stronger and more provocative piece if Mrs Johnson were lying to us, too, or if LaBute had ever decided who we were and why she was speaking to us. Unlike the more powerful monologues in <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/908708.Bash\">Bash</a>, his earlier collection of solos and one duet, the play never specifies to whom she is making this confession and when and how, which renders the drama more tenuous.</p> <p> The confession concerns a sexual relationship she had with a student some years previously. Though a liaison between a teacher and a student is clearly an abuse of power, the student was over the age of consent and an enthusiastic participant. (No reverse-gender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/10/blackbird-review-michelle-williams-and-jeff-daniels-stun-in-abuse-drama\">Blackbird </a>here.) Curiously, this seems a rare pulled punch for LaBute, a writer of maximal squirm-induction. Audiences watching his early plays could be forgiven for thinking their seats had been sprinkled with itching powder.</p> <p> Still, LaBute hasn\u2019t mellowed too much. While Mrs Johnson\u2019s overarching preoccupation is with the ways in which this encounter has continued to reverberate throughout her life, she spends a lot of time dilating on the sex itself, finally declaring, in a crescendo suggesting orgasm, \u201cI loved it. Every second of every day when that boy was fucking me!\u201d, which is probably meant to shock the few people in the audience who haven\u2019t seen <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/transparent\">Transparent</a>. </p> <p>Despite LaBute\u2019s gifts for ordinary speech, the iterations and tangents and dead-ends, much of this would seem factitious or possibly even silly, were it not for Light\u2019s finely calibrated performance and Leigh Silverman\u2019s assured direction. Silverman charts emotional terrain like an expert geographer. Here she has rather more to work with than in LaBute\u2019s last play, the staggeringly uneventful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/20/the-way-we-get-by-neil-labute\">The Way We Get By</a>, and she helps Light to particularize the pace and heat of each new disclosure. Light lets her personal constancy contrast with the messiness of Mrs Johnson\u2019s personal life, showing how a woman who believes herself in control can be revealed as powerless. If any doubt remains, she\u2019s the boss.</p>",
