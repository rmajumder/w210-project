  "<p>Film-maker Nate Parker, on an awards campaign for his debut film The Birth of a Nation, addressed a rape allegation made while he was a student in 1999.</p> <p>During his sophomore year at Penn State University, Parker and his roommate, Jean Celestin, who shares co-story credit with Parker on The Birth of a Nation, were accused of raping a female student while she was unconscious. Parker was ultimately acquitted of the charges in 2001, and Celestin\u2019s <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2001-12-07/news/25306179_1_sexual-assault-state-sentencing-guidelines-expulsion\">conviction</a> was <a href=\"http://www.wtae.com/Women-s-Rights-Group-Filed-Rape-Lawsuit-Against-Penn-State-In-02/7705896\">overturned</a>.</p> <p>Although there was no retrial, the case led to a lawsuit filed by the Women\u2019s Law Project against the university over its treatment of sexual assault. That suit was settled for a cash sum and a vow to review procedures for sexual assault cases at the school. Court documents show that the woman eventually dropped out and attempted suicide.</p> <p>Parker addressed the trial and its aftermath on Friday in an interview with <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/08/nate-parker-sex-case-the-birth-of-a-nation-oscar-race-fox-searchlight-1201799115/\">Deadline</a>, as he continued on a campaign for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/the-birth-of-a-nation-review-sundance-slavery-epic-as-brutal-as-braveheart\">The Birth of a Nation</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI was sure it would come up,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt is there, on my Wikipedia page \u2026 I stand here, a 36-year-old man, 17 years removed from one of the most painful \u2026 moments in my life. And I can imagine it was painful, for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was cleared of everything, of all charges,\u201d the film-maker added. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of living, and raised a lot of children.

When you have a certain level of success, when things start to work, things go under the microscope and become bigger and bigger things.\u201d</p> <p>In an email to Deadline, Celestin added that he\u2019s \u201csince moved on\u201d from the case and is \u201cfocusing on [his] family and writing career\u201d.</p> <p>Parker\u2019s film, which centers on the story of <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/nat-turner\">Nat Turner</a>, a former slave who led a revolt in 1831 to free African Americans in Virginia, won the Grand Jury Prize at this year\u2019s Sundance film festival, and was bought in a $17.5m worldwide rights deal to Fox Searchlight. </p>",
  "<p>For many people, $4.40 a week is a small sum \u2013 trivial even. A cup of coffee on the way to work, the parking change in the car console.</p> <p>But for those Australians set to lose between $4.40 and $7.05 a week in one of the 45th parliament\u2019s first legislative acts, many of them living below the poverty line, those small sums will make the dire choices of subsistence budgeting even more desperate.</p> <p>The cuts will come from the abolition of the clean energy supplement, which varies according to the benefit: $4.40 a week for single unemployed, $7.05 a week for a single person on the aged or disability pension.</p> <p>It\u2019s a lethally clever way for the government to save $1.3bn over four years from 2.2 million of the most disadvantaged Australians, with less political blowback than other blunter attempts at welfare savings.</p> <p>It\u2019s lethal precisely because it seems like an insignificant amount, and because the cuts apply only to new welfare recipients, so no one actually loses anything they are now getting. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/25/cutting-welfare-means-hitting-those-who-are-already-among-the-poorest-greg-jericho\">Welfare dependency in Australia is historically low. More cuts will only hurt the needy | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And, so the argument goes, the supplement was supposed to compensate for the carbon tax, and that got repealed, so the clean energy supplement has become an unnecessary and unjustifiable windfall. Something they don\u2019t really need or deserve.</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why it\u2019s caused barely a ripple. </p> <p>Except none of those arguments are true, and none can justify this cut to benefits, which both major political parties, and even the Business Council of Australia, have conceded for many years are way too low.</p> <p>For those people affected, the amounts are not at all insignificant. For Rob, a disability support pensioner living in country Victoria and looking for work, losing $7 a week would mean cutting back further on heating, or possibly food.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment I only heat the lounge room and I set it to 18 degrees because I can\u2019t afford the bills if I turn it up higher,\u201d he says. \u201cI budget about $5 a day for my main meals, so I might have to cut that back, or I might rethink whether I visited a friend because I might not be able to afford the petrol money.\u201d</p> <p>Single parents are already struggling to pay for books or school trips.</p> <p>And the impact will spread quickly. An unemployed person who takes a job and then loses it and reapplies for Newstart will no longer be eligible for the benefit. The government\u2019s savings are based on estimates that within four years it will not be paying the supplement to 2.2 million people who would otherwise get it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/28/campaign-catchup-welfare-cuts-turn-into-magic-pudding\">Campaign catchup: welfare cuts turn into magic pudding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And, for welfare recipients, it really isn\u2019t a windfall at all. In fact because of the way the supplement was introduced, if it\u2019s cut they will be worse off than they would have been if the carbon tax had never happened. This is because the carbon tax adjustment also took into account a regular inflation adjustment that would have happened anyway. So, <a href=\"http://ravebydave.blogspot.com.au/2016/05/malice-or-misunderstanding.html\">as explained in this blogpost</a>, axing the clean energy supplement doesn\u2019t take away a windfall; it actually leaves a single person on Newstart $1.80 worse off than they would have been if there had never been a carbon tax. The whole rationale for the \u201csaving\u201d is false.</p> <p>And as well as ushering in a two-tier welfare system, with higher payments for existing recipients, and lower ones for those getting benefits after the supplement is cut, there also seems to be a double standard for what counts as a windfall. </p> <p>The carbon tax adjustment payment for welfare recipients is incorrectly labelled as a windfall that must be removed, but everyone else\u2019s compensation came in the form of a tax cut, a real windfall, which they got to keep. So the unemployed person loses $4.40 a week and ends up behind, but the person earning $60,000 keeps a tax cut worth about $10 a week and stays ahead. </p> <p>The reality of what is being proposed here is even more shocking when you consider the recent history of Newstart in Australia.</p> <p>Axing the clean energy supplement will in effect be abolishing the first real increase in unemployment benefits in 20 years. The last increase was in 1994, when it rose by $2.95 a week. Research by the Australia Institute shows that the cuts will put a family living on unemployment benefits on a historic 32% below the Henderson poverty line, exacerbating the steady erosion in the value of their payments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ffd95073a49d7f1d1dc90e207c14fba8ba73098\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ffd95073a49d7f1d1dc90e207c14fba8ba73098/0_1_723_434/500.png\" alt=\"Poverty line graph\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The graph shows the difference between the Henderson poverty line and the amount of government assistance going to an unemployed family of four \u2013 two adults and two children.

The graph also assumes the government implements its policy of removing the carbon tax compensation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Australian Council of Social Service says the cuts are unconscionable and contradict repeated agreements from governments, business and unions that unemployment benefits should rise.</p> <p>A poll by the Australia Institute in Tasmania shows 60% of voters do not support the cut.</p> <p>But in the dying days of the election campaign, despite committing to review the adequacy of unemployment payments, Labor included the savings from cutting the clean energy supplement in its own budget calculations, giving the Turnbull government a powerful case to argue that the ALP should now back the legislation.</p> <p>So the 45th parliament will begin with legislation to reduce tax for people earning more than $80,000, and $48b in tax cuts for companies, and also $1.3m in \u201csavings\u201d from mean incremental cuts to the meagre payments to the most disadvantaged Australians, many of whom are already living in poverty. Is that really how it wants to start? And should those of us for whom $4.40 is loose change allow that to happen?</p>",
  "<p>\u2018Are you ready? ARE YOU READY? ARE! ... YOU! ... READY!\u201d</p> <p>The voice of the Olympic stadium announcer dissolved a little as the PA system echoed across the vast mosaic of empty blue seats on a drizzly, gloomy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/katarina-johnson-thompson-jessica-ennis-hill-heptathon-rio-2016\">opening day of Rio 2016 athletics</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/12/rio-olympics-2016-day-six-cycling-athletics-rowing-doping\">Rio Olympics 2016: women's football, tennis, athletics and basketball \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is an excellent question. So far Rio has been more or less ready, an ailing sprawl of a city just about brought into line for this first South American Olympics. But the sight of so many empty seats inside its showpiece arena on the opening morning of the athletics programme will come as a fairly major black eye for a Games that has just about held itself upright through a messy and engaging opening week.</p> <p>Rio has never really been a morning kind of place. Ask the average Carioca to leap out of bed on a rainy morning to catch some early discus heats and you might expect a little scepticism. Still, there was something surreal about the scenes inside the Olympic arena, venue for the real glamour events of the next 10 days, which kicked off almost empty, half-filled slowly and was said to be 65% sold for the evening session.</p> <p>There were loud cheers by mid-morning for some wonderful performances. Ethiopia\u2019s Almaz Ayana destroyed the 10,000m world record en route to a thrilling first athletics gold of the Games, strolling a \u00adflag-draped victory lap with the back-markers still \u00adtrailing in across the finish line. \u00adJessica Ennis-Hill produced an imperious start in the heptathlon, with fellow Brit Katrina Johnson-Thompson \u00adbounding at her heels and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/katarina-johnson-thompson-jessica-ennis-hill-heptathon-rio-2016\">snatching the lead with a sublime personal best in the high jump</a>.</p> <p>But it was still an oddly low-pressure day inside this supposed jewel of the Games. Rio will now be unfavourably compared with London 2012 and Beijing 2008, when at both Games the opening day of the athletics brought a full house, the air thick with a genuine sense of event glamour. Not so here, where the crumbly walkways were largely deserted, the food concessions un-mobbed, the flock of yellow-shirted \u00advolunteers starkly visible at times against the backdrop of the emptying stands after lunch.</p> <p>The Olympic Stadium is a steeply banked open affair with a cluster of desiccated tower blocks looming around the edge of its lovely flying roof. In the streets around the venue before the start, an early-morning drum troupe battered out some jarring samba rhythms through the rain. Local people prepared to serve barbecue and fried croquettes from converted front-room food hatches. The occasional VIP limousine swept through the main entrance, with its huge, slightly tatty bronze statues of the grand old football ghosts N\u00edlton Santos and Garrincha alongside MasterCard\u2019s Pel\u00e9, so unexpectedly absent in person from the opening ceremony just up the road.</p> <p>Otherwise it was quiet. Indeed, at times Rio\u2019s Olympic venues have provided a kind of bizarro urban world, oases of calm space in an otherwise teeming city. Overnight the news had emerged of a series of gang shootings in one of the Rio favelas. The thought occurred that any local mafiosi on the run from the cops could do worse than take refuge in some of the deserted open spaces of these Olympic Games: lie low at the golf, fade into the background at the equestrian centre.</p> <p>Later the wonderful David Rudisha of Kenya grooved through his 800m heat, one of those moments where even at this level the sight of an ultra-elite human being trotting about among mere mortals is particularly striking. There was even a mild \u201cEric the Eel\u201d moment as the last-placed runner in the women\u2019s 10,000m was still going, to huge (these things are relative) cheers, six minutes after the gold medal had been won.</p> <p>Things are expected to pick up. Usain Bolt has taken to social media to urge the public in through the doors. The Rio 2016 committee insists it has already shifted 82% of all tickets, with many athletics days already sold out. Official figures suggested 56% of the morning tickets had been sold, although there will be some laughter in the dark at the suggestion the local public is taking \u201clonger to fall in love with track and field\u201d. It has been seven years now.</p> <p>Still, it is worth remembering where these Games are taking place. Tickets are expensive relative to income. Look out the back of the stadium and rows of crumbling blocks roll away towards the hills, not quite favelas but homes of the everyday impoverished in a city where 1.4 million live without proper sanitation or security.</p> <p>In fact, whenever a lack of public interest is cited it should come with a caveat that this was a Games demanded above all by politicians, not the citizens of Rio. It was President Lula who believed the Olympics were Brazil\u2019s, or rather his own, grand destiny. Lula was of course absent here too, currently otherwise engaged fighting corruption charges. Just another empty seat on just another day of noises off at these grippingly almost-there Games.</p>",
  "<p>On Friday afternoon, American shooter Kim Rhode held her bronze. It was her sixth medal won across six Olympics on four continents, and she could feel the tears stinging her eyes. In front of her fluttered the US flag, confirmation she is now the first woman to win medals in six straight summer Olympics - her first was a gold back in 1996. Behind her fluttered an Olympic flag at half-mast to honor a Brazilian soldier killed in another spate of Rio gun violence. And those two worlds are forever complicating one of the US\u2019s most-accomplished athletes.</p> <p>She is a star shooter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/rio2016-top-american-olympic-shooter-kim-rhode-attacks-gun-control-laws\">a devoted gun advocate</a>.

He\u2019s very much for the Second Amendment.\u201d</p> <p>Soon there came more questions ...</p> <p><em>Do you support Trump solely because of guns?</em></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a list of things yes, it\u2019s not just one thing but you have to take a candidate in all. But definitely Second Amendment is a big one for me, being that\u2019s how I make my livelihood and something that is so passionate and important for me and my family for generations. Heck, I had family that was one of the 25 hand-picked men that was picked to go in and <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/indians-defeat-custer-at-little-big-horn\">save Custer and Custer\u2019s battlefield</a>.\u201d</p> <p><em>But as a female athlete who just made Olympic history wouldn\u2019t you want a woman president?</em></p> <p>\u201cYou know I mean definitely having a [female] president would be incredible just not Hillary,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Then Rhode laughed. Somehow the afternoon had gotten so far from the medal that she still wore around her neck. She speaks about guns with such calm and conviction, inviting questions with a hearty welcoming smile, she almost lures outsiders into a friendly debate. She does not complain that her Olympic press conferences have turned into discussions on gun control; she seems to like to use them as a way of <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/11/kim-rhode-olympic-shooter-takes-aim-us-gun-laws/\">advocating against laws she finds intrusive</a>.</p> <p>She also startled a French reporter when she told him that she has her three-year-old son in a youth programs with the National Rifle Association. \u201cI\u2019m covering all the bases,\u201d she said in terms of introducing him to guns.</p> <p>Getting to that press conference was not a certainty, however. Her medal was not assured. Unlike some Olympic sports, shooting can be an unpredictable event where factors like sun, wind and temperature can affect competitors. Her field was filled with talented shooters, and there was little room for imperfection. The shooting centre is located in a barren, hilly region on Rio\u2019s west side. On Friday a steady breeze taunted the shooters who also struggled to spot the discs against the distant hills. As the sun moved in and out of clouds, some of the shooters changed the filters in their glasses hoping to better see the targets.</p> <p>Rhode told herself to \u201ckeep aiming for the front\u201d of the discs, and she hit enough to find herself in a tie for third with Wei Meng of China. Personal Jesus and Smooth Criminal played softly on the loudspeakers as the two women battled. Rhode said she did not hear the songs: she was too locked in on her task. Throughout the afternoon she said she constantly thought about the sixth Olympic medal that she desperately wanted. Her history is such a part of her identity that her personal email even has a \u201c5x\u201d in it \u2013 a reference to her five straight medals before Friday.</p> <p>For a while Rhode and Wei were locked in a tight battle, neither woman giving in. She said she tried to listen to the crowd in the stands behind her cheering every hit and going \u201cooooohhhhhhh,\u201d when she missed. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they are helping you to pull the trigger every time out there,\u201d she said. Finally she pulled away by one hit. When it was over and history had been made she smiled. She waved to the crowd, found her son and tears formed in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cStanding up there on that podium it\u2019s addicting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has me coming back again and again. Every emotion hits you at once. You want to run, scream, cry and you just don\u2019t know which one to do first and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a gold, silver, bronze it\u2019s the journey. My journey was a long one this time and I got a little emotional. I\u2019m still emotional and it\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Then soldiers from both the US and Italy brought the flags and they were raised and the medal became official. And the woman who made history for America walked toward an interview tent where she would wade once more into the gun debate, and endorse for president a man who has made her homeland a very divided place.</p>",

That brings an advantage for the faster team in the pairing, because they can benefit from what British Cycling (BC) refer to as \u201ccirculating air mass\u201d. In other words, slipstream. The faster team can get into their rivals\u2019 slipstream, even if they are still some way from lapping them. The boffins at BC reckon the advantage can be worth 20-30watts. That\u2019s what they call a marginal gain.</li> <li>Someone might have shut the velodrome doors. It certainly feels hotter in here tonight.

The US opened the tournament with a historic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/07/womens-basketball-usa-senegal-rio-olympics-live\">121-56 win over Senegal</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/08/rio-2016-womens-basketball-usa-v-spain-live\">103-63 defeat of Spain</a> and a 110-85 win over Serbia on Wednesday.</p> <p>Canada, meanwhile, beat China 90-68, Serbia 71-67 and Senegal 68-58. Obviously, the point spread isn\u2019t quite as impressive, but they\u2019re still obviously a talent team and certainly the biggest challenge the US women\u2019s team have faced so far. Their lineup features Nirra Fields from the Phoenix Mercury, Natalie Achonwa of the Indiana Fever and Kia Nurse from the Connecticut Huskies, who are technically a NCAA team but might as well be a pro team. It would not be surprising at all if Canada were to put the US women\u2019s team under the same amount of pressure that Australia put on the men\u2019s team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/rio-olympics-usa-basketball-score-australia-carmelo-anthony\">on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s just me hoping that I don\u2019t get stuck liveblogging all the blowouts. (Yes, this probably isn\u2019t very patriotic of me.) If you want to join in during today\u2019s liveblog, you can just send your questions, commentary and predictions to us and we\u2019ll use them over the course of the next few hours.

In the meantime, here\u2019s Geno Auriemma on our \u201cTrumpian era\u201d:</em></p> <p>Auriemma said: \u201cWe live in that Trumpian era where it\u2019s OK to be sexist and degrade people that are good, just because they\u2019re the opposite sex.</p> <p>\u201cWe are what we are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to apologize for being that good. We\u2019re never going to apologize for setting a standard that other people aspire to achieve. We got a guy in the pool with a USA swim cap on who nobody can beat. And if he wasn\u2019t in swimming, there would be a lot of other guys with gold medals.</p> <p>He said of his team: \u201cThese are Olympians. They\u2019re supposed to play at a high level. They\u2019re professionals, they\u2019re supposed to put on a show, they\u2019re supposed to entertain. So, what are we supposed to do? Just go out there and win by a little? We\u2019re not bad for women\u2019s basketball, just like I say at UConn, we\u2019re not bad for women\u2019s basketball. What\u2019s bad for women\u2019s basketball is when nobody\u2019s great, because then you could say, \u201cYou know what?

  "<p>A New Hampshire family\u2019s missing rubber duck has suddenly reappeared, along with a suitcase full of souvenirs and an international mystery.</p> <p>Stolen in 2011, the Troiano family\u2019s duck returned home last week, <a href=\"http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20160811/NEWS/160819773/11669/NEWS\">Seacoastonline</a> reported. In the years since it disappeared, the family has received countless postcards and photos from \u201cGale Ducky\u201d as it traveled around the globe. The yellow duck had visited 20 countries on its journey, from Austria to South Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"rubber duck mystery\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgaleducky%2Fposts%2F228244733920594%3A0&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"588\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/galeducky/\">Facebook</a> account for the duck was created, presumably by its anonymous travel buddy, and has just over 800 likes from people following its journey. The Troiano family said they liked to follow along as well. \u201cEvery so often I revisit this page and it makes me smile and laugh!\u201d Alicia Troiano, the duck\u2019s original owner, commented on the page last year.</p> <p>Troiano received the duck about 10 years ago from a neighbor that she babysat for. She would put the duck in a pond that formed in their front yard when it rained before it was stolen.</p> <p>Months after the theft, the family received a postcard from Gale Ducky originating in Kuwait City. It informed the family of the Facebook page and of the duck\u2019s recent trips to Honduras and Amsterdam. The duck covered much of the globe and the US, going to Las Vegas, San Diego and on a number of cruises.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"gale ducky\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgaleducky%2Fphotos%2Fa.194664603945274.49019.131248626953539%2F202471613164573%2F%3Ftype%3D3&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"464\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"gale ducky\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgaleducky%2Fphotos%2Fa.333470926731307.75037.131248626953539%2F333470946731305%2F%3Ftype%3D3&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"464\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In photos from each stop, the duck posed for photos with locals and tourists.

Jennifer Troiano, Alicia\u2019s mother, recognized the background as her sidewalk.</p> <p>\u201cI just was like, \u2018What is she doing home?\u2019\u201d Jennifer Troiano told Seacoastonline. \u201cWhere has she been? Who had her?\u201d</p> <p>In its suitcase, Gale Ducky had maps from its travels, a friendship bracelet, sunglasses and a Mickey Mouse ears cap among other items.</p> <p>\u201cI will miss seeing the funny pictures that pop up on Facebook and waiting to find out his next destination,\u201d Alicia Troiano said, now that her duck has returned home.</p> <p>It is still unknown who took the duck for the global adventure. The family had some theories on who took it \u2013 perhaps a pilot. Jennifer Troiano was happy to let the identity remain a mystery for now, but her daughter was still curious.</p> <p>\u201cI have so many questions,\u201d Alicia Troiano said. \u201cI want to know why they were inspired to pick him up out of his pond and bring around the world, especially since he is not a very small or portable duck.\u201d</p> <p>The Troiano family and the duck, which has its own email address, did not return requests for comment.</p>",

Warcraft: The Beginning didn\u2019t bother to make a lick of sense. Alice Through the Looking Glass squandered the wonder that characterized Tim Burton\u2019s Alice in Wonderland, burdening itself with a lame time-travelling plot.

DC\u2019s second big film of the year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/09/suicide-squad-killing-joke-dc-comics-women-misogyny\">Suicide Squad</a>, was a hodgepodge of a blockbuster, assembling a bunch of underdeveloped villains to fight a villain even hokier than Oscar Isaac\u2019s titular purple god in X-Men: Apocalypse. Nine Lives, Barry Sonnenfeld\u2019s kiddie flick about a cat voiced by Kevin Spacey, shouldn\u2019t have been granted life at all. A third Garfield film would have been more welcome than this drivel.</p> <p>But all is not lost for summer 2016.

Despite the plot\u2019s core similarities to Toy Story (it imagines the secret lives of food, instead of toys), Sausage Party is distinctly non-Pixar, by gorging on racial and cultural stereotypes (<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/edward-norton\">Edward Norton</a> does a killer Woody Allen impression to play a Jewish bagel who butts heads with an Arabic flatbread; Salma Hayek voices a lesbian taco), meanwhile engaging in a radical thread that questions the existence of God \u2013 and the destructive harm organized religion can breed.

The latest in Disney\u2019s fruitful bid to remake all of its animated classics comes from indie darling David Lowery, a young film-maker who showed great promise at the Sundance film festival in 2013 with his artful and subtly devastating romance Ain\u2019t Them Bodies Saints. Pete\u2019s Dragon, his first studio gamble, retains the homespun quality that made his last picture so endearing, despite its boasting a blockbuster-sized budget and visual effects galore. It bests The Jungle Book, until now the best-received of the Disney live-action revamps, by bearing the stamp of its formally rigorous maker so strongly.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/aug/11/robert-redford-petes-dragon-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qdh4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2647462\"            data-video-name=\"Robert Redford: 'Technology deprives us of coming up with our own stories' \u2013 video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ac4a1de4b024cdec3d6831\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/11/160810PetesDragon_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/11/160810PetesDragon.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/11/160810PetesDragon_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/aug/11/robert-redford-petes-dragon-video-interview\">Robert Redford: \u2018Technology deprives us of coming up with our own stories\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>According to Rogen, every studio except Sony passed on Sausage Party because <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/08/seth-rogen-on-the-insane-sausage-party-orgy-and-almost-performing-at-kanye-and-kim-s-wedding.html\">nobody had seen anything like it before</a> \u2013 a reveal that should surprise no one. In today\u2019s marketplace, which seems to value \u201ccinematic universe\u201d-building over gutsy innovation, the fact that Sausage Party was even made is a miracle unto itself. Its low budget, reported to be around $30m (this year\u2019s biggest animated hit, Finding Dory, cost a whopping $200m), no doubt played a part in its creation.<br></p> <p>Lowery, meanwhile, claims that Disney was adamant that he retain his directorial voice on Pete\u2019s Dragon. \u201cThey never referred to it as a Disney movie,\u201d he told <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2016/08/petes-dragon-remake-director-david-lowery-interview-studio-micro-budget-1201714850/\">Indiewire</a>. \u201cThey referred to it as a David Lowery movie. It was weird to hear those words uttered on the Disney lot.\u201d</p> <p>The project\u2019s creative success is no doubt attributed to the creative control granted to Lowery. Conversely, respected directors Ava DuVernay and Edgar Wright weren\u2019t afforded that freedom by Marvel, and abandoned ship as a result, citing \u201ccreative differences\u201d. Meanwhile, it\u2019s become routine for studios to interfere with potential moneymakers. Warner Bros is said to have ordered reshoots on Suicide Squad to \u201cadd more action\u201d \u2013 and look how that turned out. Given the way blockbusters seem to be completed nowadays, Disney\u2019s handling of Pete\u2019s Dragon can be viewed as downright rebellious.</p> <p>Combined, both Sausage Party and Pete\u2019s Dragon show that studios are still evidently capable of delivering strong commercial product that\u2019s both creative and confidently mounted. Should the films win over audiences, their popularity can hopefully inspire Hollywood execs to think outside the box more, and take needed risks to keep the medium alive and thriving. They owe it to us after this summer.</p>",
  "<p>Even as victims underwent treatment and the debris was being swept up, Thai authorities were quick to state that they were in control after multiple explosions killed at least four and injured dozens on Thursday night and Friday morning. The attacks did not amount to terrorism but merely \u201clocal sabotage \u2026 restricted to limited areas and provinces\u201d, police said.</p> <p>Control is, after all, the junta\u2019s raison d\u2019etre. The military says its 2014 coup was necessary to end unrest and \u201creturn happiness\u201d to Thailand after a cycle of mass protests and violence. Last week, the public approved a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/thailand-votes-in-favour-of-military-backed-constitution\" title=\"\">new constitution</a>, which in theory paves the way for elections and tackles corruption but, notably, entrenches military power and institutionalises impunity for abuses. Officials have hinted that political opponents could be to blame for the bombings \u2013 and some analysts think so too, citing the timing: just after the constitution vote and on the eve of the queen\u2019s birthday. Others <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37059508\" title=\"\">are less sure</a>, suggesting that links to a long-running southern insurgency cannot be ruled out and that the military is bound to play down a terrorist threat which could damage tourism \u2013 two resorts were hit \u2013 and to paint its critics in the worst possible colours. So far, details of the bombing do not offer a natural fit with either explanation and other theories (perhaps a conflict within the elite) cannot be excluded.</p> <p>What is clear is the contrast between the violence and the stability the ruling National Council for Peace and Order says it has brought. It describes its rule as transitional, but Prayuth Chan-ocha, the regime\u2019s head, says Thailand is already \u201c99.9% democratic\u201d, and no one is holding their breath for the general election date, now mooted for late 2017. The NCPO has overseen a further disturbing deterioration in human rights, and the constitution was passed with a clear majority but on a low turnout, after campaigning against it was banned. Its approval may reflect public weariness with military rule and a desire to move on, however imperfectly, rather than satisfaction with the regime.</p> <p>Behind all these manoeuvrings lie elite concerns that tensions bubbling under the surface could soon break through. The junta declares its priority to be defending the monarchy, which has established itself in the popular imagination as the stabilising moral force holding the nation together. But the world\u2019s longest-serving monarch, King Bhumibol, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/21/ailing-thai-king-treated-for-excess-fluid-in-spine-and-brain/\" title=\"\">is now gravely ill</a>, and few believe his son can play the same role and muster that support. It would be better if the potential consequences could be addressed honestly, but Thailand\u2019s stringent l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/man-jailed-for-30-years-in-thailand-for-insulting-the-monarchy-on-facebook\" title=\"\">used increasingly aggressively</a> to penalise political dissent. In the background looms Thaksin Shinawatra, the exiled populist tycoon who twice stormed to electoral victory, only to be deposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/26/thailand1\" title=\"\">in a 2006 coup</a>. He enriched himself and his friends, undermined or closed independent institutions, and his tenure saw a string of human rights violations, including 2,700 extrajudicial executions in an anti-drugs campaign and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4742976.stm\" title=\"\">a harsh crackdown on the south</a>, which caused decades-old grievances to explode into violence that is now endemic. But he was wildly popular and several proxies followed him, the last of them being his sister Yingluck, ejected in the last coup.</p> <p>Thailand has seen 19 of those since the absolute monarchy ended in 1932. But in recent years, the forces underlying political conflicts have shifted. Thaksin is a symptom, not a cause; he won by allying business interests to the rural poor, promising benefits such as cheap healthcare. The latter are no longer prepared to be ruled by and for urban elites; the old social contract has broken. They want a bigger slice of the pie and they want to get it by picking their own leader.</p> <p>Many in Thailand are nervous about what the future holds, and they have good cause. The military has exploited anxiety to defend its own interests. But control can only suppress, not dissolve, the underlying tensions; and it will not do even that for ever. Sooner or later the country must face up to these challenges.</p>",

  "<p>The pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK have said the scheme can be restructured without entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), boosting the prospects of a rescue deal for the company.<br></p> <p>The British Steel Pension Scheme has liabilities of \u00a315bn and a deficit of as much as \u00a3700m by some measures, making it a serious obstacle for a rescue deal for Tata Steel UK and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales.</p> <p>Tata Steel is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/hopes-rise-for-tata-steel-rescue-deal\"> increasingly confident about securing the future of its UK business</a>, which employs 11,000 people, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator. The company plans to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/tata-stops-port-talbot-plant-sale-as-talks-begin-with-german-steel-group\"> merge its European operations, including the UK business, with those of ThyssenKrupp</a>, the German conglomerate. However, the deal is conditional on the British Steel Pension Scheme being restructured and the government providing financial support.</p> <p>Allan Johnston, chair of the pension trustees, said the scheme could avoid falling into the PPF if the benefits for workers were modified.</p> <p>Although it is well-funded compared with other schemes, with the deficit narrowing to \u00a3300m on some measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are keen to keep its liabilities under control.</p> <p>Johnston said the trustees accepted it \u201cwould not be realistic\u201d for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel UK to take on responsibility for funding the current and future deficit. Modifying the benefits of the scheme was a more attractive option than it entering the PPF, he added, where workers would have to accept reduced terms.</p> <p>Tata Steel sources have warned it could still sell Port Talbot. The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steelworks since talks began about the future of its UK business in March, and this has been used as a bargaining chip in talks with the British government.</p> <p>Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business \u201cmore sustainable\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking at the sidelines of Tata Steel\u2019s annual meeting in India, Chatterjee said talks to restructure the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted the scheme is well-funded.</p> <p>\u201cWe are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders like the government of Wales and so on,\u201d Chatterjee said, according to the Times of India.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a recognition that pension has a certain impact in a commodity business like steel, so we have to find a structural solution, which does not impact the business going forward.\u201d</p> <p>The pension trustees\u2019 willingness to cooperate in talks to restructure the scheme will be welcomed by Tata Steel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=pension_protection_fund\" data-alt=\"Tata pensions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=pension_protection_fund\">Tata pensions</a> </figure>  <p>The potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law.</p> <p>Johnston added: \u201cThe trustee and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the Pensions Regulator with compelling evidence of the scheme\u2019s ability to pay modified benefits indefinitely and on a low-risk basis outside the Pension Protection Fund.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/hopes-rise-for-tata-steel-rescue-deal\">Hopes rise for Tata Steel rescue deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOur investment strategy has meant that the scheme\u2019s funding position has not been affected by recent falls in gilt yields in the same way as many other UK pension schemes, and we remain confident of the scheme\u2019s ability to provide modified benefits as proposed on a self-sufficient basis.\u201d</p>",

But that relies&#xa0;on the politician implicitly accepting the usual rules of the game, which Trump does not. As Britons know&#xa0;well from bitter and recent experience \u2013 after the pro-Brexit camp cut through with the utterly bogus claim&#xa0;that Britain sent \u00a3350m a week to the EU \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\" title=\"\">willingness to lie</a> can be a powerful asset. Trump enjoys a kind of freedom that his more conventional opponents lack. They have at least one hand tied behind their back, feeling an obligation to stick as closely as possible to the truth. Trump is&#xa0;unbound.</p> <p>Which brings us to a sensitive point. Tony Schwartz, who as Trump\u2019s ghostwriter had intimate and daily access to Trump over 18 months in the&#xa0;1980s, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\" title=\"\">witnessed the constant lies</a>, the tiny attention span and inability to&#xa0;concentrate, the intense egotism \u2013 and concluded that Trump was \u201cpathologically impulsive and self-centred\u201d. In short, a&#xa0;\u201csociopath\u201d.</p> <p>The dean of Harvard Medical School has said Trump does not just have narcissistic personality disorder, \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jflier/status/759466280504193026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" title=\"\">he defines it</a>\u201d. Indeed this view has become&#xa0;so widespread that the American Psychiatric Association felt compelled to remind its members this week&#xa0;of the Goldwater rule \u2013 named after an earlier Republican presidential nominee routinely branded as unhinged&#xa0;\u2013 which urges practitioners <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/07/the-american-psychiatric-association-reminds-its-doctors-no-psychoanalyzing-donald-trump/?postshare=7811470690296455&amp;tid=ss_tw\" title=\"\">not to offer a&#xa0;diagnosis of an individual they have not treated</a>.</p> <p>The point is, someone who fits what we might politely call Trump\u2019s psychological profile \u2013 someone as disinhibited, as willing to disregard social norms \u2013 is perilously difficult to confront. But there might just be a way.</p> <p>For why was it that not just the liberal&#xa0;usual suspects, but almost all his&#xa0;fellow Republicans denounced Trump for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\" title=\"\">attacking Khizr and Ghazala Khan</a>, the Gold Star parents of Capt Humayun Khan, the Muslim-American killed while fighting for his country in 2004? The answer is the same one that explains the bipartisan outrage that greeted Trump\u2019s suggestion that Judge Gonzalo Curiel could not be objective in deciding a case involving Trump because of his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican\" title=\"\">Mexican heritage</a>\u201d \u2013 even though Curiel was born in Indiana.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a time when a single deception could ruin a politician. But Trump doesn't play by the usual rules</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What Trump had done was violate a core American ideal: the notion \u2013 not always honoured, admittedly \u2013 that no matter where your family came from, if you were born in the US or had come there and subscribed to its founding principles, then you were as American as a direct descendant of those who landed on Plymouth Rock. This was what set the US apart, the belief that national identity did not reside in blood or soil, but in loyalty to the nation\u2019s constitution and its bill of rights.</p> <p>Or consider Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US; it was again attacked by Republicans as well as Democrats because it contradicts America\u2019s founding purpose, to be a haven from religious persecution, a purpose encapsulated in the constitution\u2019s first amendment guaranteeing the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of religion. Or reflect on Trump\u2019s little joke this week, suggesting the way to deal with Clinton might be a bullet \u2013 at odds with America\u2019s professed determination to resolve its differences through a constitution, the law and elections.</p> <p>The common thread is that all these moves by Trump are not just reactionary or bigoted or dangerous. They contradict the ideals that all Americans are meant to regard as sacred. Perhaps this is the way to attack Trump: as truly un-American. He says he wants to make America great again. The truth is, he would stop America being America.</p>",

It is chalk downland and on it I rear 30 or 40 beef shorthorn cattle, an old and noble native breed that has been recently recognised for its ability to thrive and fatten on grassland. I use no artificial fertiliser derived from fossil fuels and depend entirely on the manure that the cattle produce when they lie on straw in the barn during the winter. This way I can replenish the land and its fertility. I also have a vegetable garden and this too&#xa0;depends on the manure to boost the&#xa0;quality of the soil, to make it friable and moisture retentive.</p> <p>So when Mr Monbiot declares that he will have no truck with animal products, I am at a loss as to how he or any vegan imagines that vegetables, or indeed grain, can be grown without animal manure \u2013 unless it is with artificial fertilisers. With a lot of care and attention, it is possible to produce enough compost to nurture a veg garden \u2013 but a whole field of wheat, oat or barley? When Lady Balfour founded the Soil Association, the health of the soil was at the basis of her philosophy. I firmly believe that organic farming can strike the balance between consumption of animal products and caring for the environment. I was horrified by the story of the river pollution in Devon and hope that the dairy farm in question was not organic because we really do have some very strict rules and are inspected to enforce these. In any case, the CAP rules also regulate emissions from farms and if these are broken one would expect the farmer to be fined and subsidies to be severely reduced.</p> <p>What I would really like is a reply from someone who grows 20 acres of wheat on thin soil without the use of animal manure. Maybe this rara avis exists. But meantime I look down on the hundreds of tons of rich FYM ( farmyard manure lying waiting to be spread in the autumn and feel that this recycling is the best way of maintaining the soil whose health in turn ensures that of man and beast whether wild or domestic.<br><strong>Penny Reid</strong><br><em>Wantage, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I wish that anti-meat-eaters would stop making veganism look such a no-brainer. George Monbiot states that \u201creplacing meat with soya reduces the clearance of natural vegetation, per kilogram of protein, by 96%\u201d. It actually reduces it in Britain by 100% because, unlike most meat we eat in the UK, soya can\u2019t be grown here at all, so it is 100% imported. No wonder we\u2019d apparently use so little agricultural land to support a nation of vegans. But what about food security?<br><strong>David Mills</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot does not mention the other big existential threat facing our species. The huge amount of antibiotics fed to animals means that the consumers of meat are becoming immune to them. This is a nightmare scenario and diseases that were brought under control over the last 100 years are reappearing. People are already dying as antibiotics are no longer working. Because George consumes milk, fish and meat albeit occasionally he cannot be counted a vegetarian or a vegan. Perhaps he needs to look at the compassionate factor of not eating animals.<br><br><strong>Nitin Mehta</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 On a recent train journey from Reading to Devon \u2013 having attended a conference spelling out the many benefits of a plant-based diet for people with multiple sclerosis \u2013 I couldn\u2019t help but notice the vast majority of our countryside is dedicated to the production of meat and dairy products which George Monbiot quite rightly describes as the reason we need to import so much food, create so much pollution and indeed, ill health.</p> <p>I have MS, and have benefited from a plant-based, no-sugar diet. The NHS would be able to cope with capacity to spare if less dairy, meat and sugar were consumed. The UK would be self-sufficient in food and it might even become possible to meet our climate change obligations with sustainable production.</p> <p>I wonder what a train trip of our country would look like with a nation of vegans. More woodland, more wetlands, more wildlife, more jobs, more diversity, and smaller hospitals. This would be a big improvement on the \u201cgreen desert\u201d passing the railway window at the moment.<br><strong>Dr Colin Bannon</strong><br><em>Crapstone, Devon </em></p> <p>\u2022 Two cases involving what appears to be uninformed parenting are no grounds to throw parents of vegan children behind bars (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/10/parents-children-vegan-diet-prosecuted-italian-law\" title=\"\">Parents who feed children vegan diet face prosecution under proposed Italian law</a>, theguardian.com, 10 August). Vegan foods \u2013 which are cholesterol-free, low in saturated fat, and rich in complex carbohydrates, protein, fibre, vitamins, and minerals \u2013 are optimal for children.</p> <p>The late Dr Benjamin Spock, a leading authority on childcare, spoke out against feeding animal-derived foods to children, advising that they can cause diabetes and, in the long term, set kids up for obesity, cancer, high blood pressure and heart disease. He also held that consuming plant-based foods forms the foundation of dietary habits that support a lifetime of good health.</p> <p>This is one of the many reasons why countless conscientious parents have raised or are raising healthy babies on well-planned, nutritionally complete vegan diets \u2013 and our children are thriving.

  "<p>For the 1.5 million civilians still surviving in Aleppo, the tragedy that has befallen their ancient and once-beautiful city must have made it a hell on earth. After five years of civil war, of barrel bombs dropped from helicopters, indiscriminate shelling and street-by-street fighting, it now seems beyond doubt that the Assad regime is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/suspected-chlorine-attack-kills-at-least-three-in-aleppo-says-relief-group\">using chemical weapons</a> against the civilian population of what was once Syria\u2019s second city. On Thursday, the day when the first of a series of three-hour ceasefires was supposed to come into effect to allow some humanitarian aid to get through, doctors reported seeing victims suffering from what they diagnosed as chlorine inhalation.</p> <p>The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/12/world/middleeast/syria-chlorine-gas-attack.html?_r=0\">reported</a> that four people had been killed in the attack, on the district of Zubdiya. A few days earlier, gas bombs apparently filled with chlorine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/chlorine-attack-syria-dozens-ill-saraqeb-idlib\">left four dead and dozens fighting for breath</a> in Saraqeb in Idlib, in the area where a Russian helicopter had recently been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/syrian-rebels-launch-operation-to-break-aleppo-siege\">shot down</a>, killing all five crewmen on board.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/we-need-facts-about-the-use-of-chemical-weapons-in-syria\">We need facts about the use of chemical weapons in Syria | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has been evidence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/syria-chemical-weapons-attacks-almost-1500-killed-report-united-nations\">the use of chlorine</a> in chemical weapons, most commonly by the Assad regime but also by Islamic State forces, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc12001.doc.htm\">for at least two years</a>. It is a common, naturally occurring element that is too valuable in everyday life as a water purifier and as a disinfectant (ironically, particularly in hospitals) to be banned. It is not, for example, included in the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed up to after the Ghouta chemical attack, in which sarin gas may have killed as many as 1,000 residents of an outer suburb of Damascus in August 2013. It was after that that the Assad regime destroyed its stockpile of outlawed chemical and biological weapons.</p> <p>Last year, in response to the growing number of reports, the UN security council set up <a href=\"https://unoda-web.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/JIM-Fact-Sheet-July2016.pdf\">the joint investigative mission</a> to gather evidence and witness accounts of the chlorine attacks. Although the use of chlorine is hard to verify, any evidence of it being used to cause indiscriminate harm to civilians could be the basis of a prosecution for war crimes.</p> <p>Chemical weapons \u2013 even chlorine, which lacks the immediate and often catastrophic impact of high explosive \u2013 serve two purposes that conventional weapons do not. For their victims, their silence and the uncertainty of their extent and nature amplify the terror of the attack. And the virtual silence of the international community in the face of a blatant breach of UN-backed, globally recognised conventional law merely underlines the powerlessness of the rest of the world and the sense of impunity with which the regime is operating.</p> <p>It is nearly 100 years since the use of chemical weapons was outlawed by the international community. Then it was the League of Nations\u2019 <a href=\"https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/280?OpenDocument\">Geneva protocol</a>, a practical response to the horror of the use of chlorine and mustard gas by all sides in the first world war which had left millions of ex-combatants either blind or with lungs so damaged that they were semi-invalids. The protocol never quite lapsed, but during the cold war it was widely ignored. Only in the 1990s was a new treaty drawn up, which unlike the original one outlawed the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons as well as their use. Now backed by more than 160 countries, it is monitored by the Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Yet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/syria-suspected-chlorine-gas-attack-in-aleppo-kills-woman-and-two-children\">as one doctor in Aleppo observed bitterly</a>, using chemical agents without accountability is the new normal in Syria.</p> <p>Ever since the crossing of President Obama\u2019s red line by the sarin attack in Damascus three years ago, the Assad regime has appeared increasingly confident that it can attack with chemical weapons without fear of reprisal. The UN\u2019s monitors are due to report by November. But the taboo has already been broken, and many hundreds of people are likely to suffer the consequences of this new failure by the international community.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 August 2016. An earlier version incorrectly described chlorine as a compound,</p>",

But there\u2019s been a broader shift, too, from the OBO as a means for people in offices furtively to keep in touch with the score, to people who use it as an extended sitting room or bar, to chat about the cricket while they watch it.

Will your effort be rewarded appropriately? Or will you get a good degree? Those who receive a 2:2, and jauntily tell their friends they \u201cgot a Desmond\u201d because they are at an age where they still find rhyming slang funny, are generally using banter to disguise mild disappointment. It\u2019s a Desmond, sure, but if only they\u2019d occasionally responded to that irksome 11am alarm, it might have got a Trevor Nunn or even a Geoff Hurst.</p> <p>In Test cricket, where colons are replaced by dashes, a 2-2 is nothing to be disappointed about. It\u2019s a rare and admirable thing. There have been only ten 2-2 series draws in Test history, and that result is so much worthier than a 1-1 draw: the players have been through so much more \u2013 look at Moeen Ali\u2019s arc for an example \u2013 and the ebb and flow has been greater. They are Test series in name and nature, and at the end of the series, two weary teams get together to chew the fat over a beer Gatorade.</p> <p>The 2-2s of the modern era were all memorable, heartwarming series: the 1972 Ashes, England v West Indies in 1991 (<a href=\"http://www.alloutcricket.com/features/golden-summer-1991\">READ ALL ABOUT IT HERE</a>) and 1995, Brian Lara v Australia in 1998-99, and England v South Africa in 2003. Most ended with the kind of goodwill that is unique to the hard-fought 2-2 draw.</p> <p>Pakistan want a Desmond here, they want it real bad, and they are in with a fair chance after an excellent morning at the Oval. They reached 97 for two, a deficit of 231, with the nightwatchman Yasir Shah the only man to go. There were also three dropped catches from England. </p> <p>A 2-2 would probably be the right result in what has been a lovely series. For Pakistan, there is additional motivation: a Desmond would probably ensure they are Geoff Hurst in the Test rankings by next weekend. (<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/1044027.html\">You can view the permutations here</a>.) Pakistan have never been top since the rankings were introduced in 2003.

In fact they are twice as likely as men to receive a custodial sentence for a first offence, and the main offence for which women are imprisoned is theft and shoplifting.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, , said: \u201cPhilip Davies is a man with form on these issues. Tragically, in 2016 he sounds increasingly anachronistic and at odds with many in his own party, including the prime minister herself.

Perhaps we\u2019ll even be generous enough to save a slice for him.\u201d<br></p> <p>In one section of his speech, which was delivered in July and appeared on Buchanan\u2019s YouTube page two weeks ago, he suggested women were treated more favourably in the family courts, which often deal with child custody.</p> <p>He said: \u201cMany women use their children as a stick to beat the father with, either because they\u2019re bitter about the failed relationship, for financial reasons, or because they\u2019ve moved on and it\u2019s easier for them if their new partner takes on the role of father to their children.\u201d</p> <p>Davies told the conference: \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an issue between men and women. The problem is being stirred up by those who can be described as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/19/philip-daviestory-mp-politically-correct-males-pander-to-militant-feminists\">militant feminists and the politically correct males who pander to this nonsense</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me that this has led to an \u2018equality but only when it suits\u2019 agenda that applies to women. The drive for women to have so-called equality on all the things that suit the politically correct agenda but not other things that don\u2019t is of increasing concern to me.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, we hear plenty about increasing the numbers of women on company boards and female representation in parliament; however, there\u2019s a deafening silence when it comes to increasing the number of men who have custody of their children or who have careers as midwives.

  "<p>Poundland boss Kevin O\u2019Byrne is being offered \u00a32.7m of shares in Steinhoff if he stays on under the ownership of the South African retail group.</p> <p>The budget retailer\u2019s shareholders will vote on 7 September on whether to accept a \u00a3610.4m offer from Steinhoff, which owns furniture chains Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the South African retail group increased its offer for Poundland by 5p a share to 227p, including a dividend, after an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/steinhoff-may-need-to-increase-offer-for-poundland\">activist investor, Elliott Capital Advisors, amassed a shareholding</a> with the potential to upset the takeover.</p> <p>It is not clear if Elliott, which is estimated to have made about a \u00a33m profit from its late intervention in the deal, will definitely accept the new offer. But Poundland\u2019s chairman, Darren Shapland, said the deal offered shareholders the chance to cash in their shares at \u201can improved price and on an enhanced premium to Poundland\u2019s undisturbed share price\u201d.</p> <p>The final details of Steinhoff\u2019s offer were sent to shareholders on Friday and the document reveals that O\u2019Byrne will be handed Steinhoff shares equivalent to four and a half times his \u00a3600,000 annual basic salary in lieu of the Poundland shares he had been promised when he became chief executive this year. However, he will receive the payment only if he stays with the company for about three years from November, when he was originally due to be granted the Poundland shares, and meets certain undefined performance criteria.</p> <p>If he chooses to leave before November, O\u2019Byrne will be granted a cash payment equivalent to 55% of the share award reduced pro-rata by the amount of time he has spent in the job \u2013 in other words, a much lower amount. </p> <p>The share bonus scheme indicates that Steinhoff is keen to retain O\u2019Byrne, who is understood to have had a meeting with a key shareholder in the South African firm, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/christo-wiese-south-african-billionaire-prepares-for-move-to-uk\">Christo Wiese</a>, at the Ritz last month.</p> <p>Whether he decides to stay on or not, O\u2019Byrne will collect \u00a3772,000 from the sale of his 600,000 shares in the company. He bought most of those shares at 179p each in March, making a profit of at least \u00a3154,000 in just a few months.</p> <p>But O\u2019Byrne\u2019s windfall pales in comparison to former boss Jim McCarthy, who will cash in more than \u00a322.7m from the sale of his shares in Poundland. </p> <p>Last month, it emerged that rebel investor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/steinhoff-may-need-to-increase-offer-for-poundland\">Elliott Capital Advisors had taken control of a 13.2% stake</a> in Poundland. Since then the US hedge fund, which has a history of pushing for better terms in takeovers, has bought more shares and now speaks for 17.5%.</p> <p></p>",

There was a modest upward revision (2 tenths of a percentage point) to June\u2019s figure, but it is still a miss. Car sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good.</p> <p>In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the \u201ccontrol group\u201d which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn\u2019t exactly roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter.</p> <p>We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% year on year from 1.3%.</p> <p>So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures looking benign it doesn\u2019t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking rates imminently.

Brexit may not have put developers off building yet but this slow down needs to be reversed if enough new homes are to be built over the next few years. Work has dropped quarter-on-quarter and so too has the number of new homes approved in the capital \u2013 with a 22% drop in Q2 2016 from the previous year.</p> <p>But, as ever with construction and house building, it\u2019s all about the pipeline. Next year will see huge construction projects like HS2 and Crossrail take centre stage \u2013 having a huge knock on benefit for housing and infrastructure opportunities. This will open up new areas of London and once the bricks start being laid momentum will keep growing. London desperately needs more homes to be built. Planning inefficiency is one of the main delays leading many developers to re-think projects. One of the new government\u2019s top priorities should be a new willingness to challenge the rigid planning system and bring new homes to London.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad96bee4b0f231200da2b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:29:35.340Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Employers obviously want free movement to continue, according to the NIESR study.

In this respect anecdotal indicators are not encouraging with, for example, the construction PMI edging down to a new seven year low of 45.9 in July.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.lindafairstein.com/\">Linda Fairstein</a> was the chief of the sex crimes unit, later called the special victims unit, at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office from 1976 until 2002. Since 1996, she has published 18 crime novels about a female prosecutor named Alexandra Cooper, who just happens to be the chief of the special victims unit at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. Smartly plotted, the novels draw on Fairstein\u2019s considerable experience and expertise. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/linda-fairstein/killer-look/\">Killer Look</a>, the most recent entry in the saga of Alexandra Cooper, sees a heroine slowly regaining her strength after a dramatic kidnapping experience. Three weeks after her release, Cooper is not yet back at her desk, but can\u2019t help herself from tagging along with the handsome detective Mike Chapman as he investigates the high-profile death of a big-name American fashion designer. Fairstein spoke from Montana about her new fun, fashion-loving crime novel.</p> <p><strong>Alexandra Cooper is loosely \u2013 perhaps even not-so-loosely \u2013 based on your actual experiences as the chief of the sex crimes unit in the Manhattan DA\u2019s office. What is it like continue your career as a prosecutor through fiction?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m still a lawyer. I keep all my credentials current and actually work on cases and write pieces about the law. I\u2019m still very involved in advocacy and lawyering for victims of violence, and, in particular, I stay very close to the Manhattan DA\u2019s office, where I worked for 30 years, and where Alex Cooper works in the novels. I stay connected because I love it. And, of course, it serves me well, I think \u2013 I can stay up to date on forensics, for example, and that can inform how Alex might handle a case. When I started the series, Alex Cooper was 35, and I was maybe a decade older. She\u2019s only 38 now, 18 books later. Of course, I\u2019m much past that point. It requires a lot more of me to think and act like a 38-year-old woman. I\u2019m saying that with a big smile on my face. It\u2019s part of the fun.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel like Alex, as a 38-year-old female prosecutor in 2016, has a lot of privileges that you didn\u2019t?</strong></p> <p>Yes. One of the things I really thought I was going to show in in these books was a woman in a non-traditional role. Most crime novels written by women before the 80s, let\u2019s say, featured amateur sleuths \u2013 like in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/agathachristie\">Agatha Christie</a>\u2019s novels. Women never used to be police chiefs or forensic scientists or homicide prosecutors. So, I thought how great to be able to show an actual female prosecutor in a very high profile position. It was totally uncommon in the 70s, and people were just getting used to it in the 90s. Now, it\u2019s old hat. </p> <p>But when I joined the DA\u2019s office in 1972, there were only seven women, out of about 200 prosecutors. Back then, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/frank-hogan-keeping-decent-proper-article-1.849350\">Frank Hogan</a>, the district attorney of New York, did not allow women to work homicide cases. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in the law library,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think women should be trying murder cases, talking about blood and guts in front of juries.\u201d</p> <p>But things changed. Mr Hogan died in 1974. Diversity of all kinds became a much healthier thing in the Manhattan DA\u2019s office. But that was just in New York. Imagine the rest of the country, then. For the most part, we just didn\u2019t exist \u2013 we, meaning women prosecutors. Ours, in Manhattan, was the first sex crimes unit in the country. So it was a very different world, and, yes, I very much wanted to show a strong woman in a non-traditional role. Now, you see it on TV. You see it in movies. You see it in a lot of crime novels. And of course, you see it in real life, which is the happiest change.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel like that\u2019s changed the way that you\u2019ve written these books? The fact that when we do watch crime procedurals on television, for example, there is, very often, some sense of gender parity on the team?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve not gone back and read my first three novels, from the 90s, but I\u2019m quite sure that they reflect a different tone. It was more unusual for someone like Alex Cooper to show up at a homicide crime scene, or to walk into the morgue. Now, it\u2019s far less shocking. </p> <p>For instance, if you were to call up the New York chief medical examiner\u2019s office today, I think more than 70% of the forensic biologists are women. There were no, or very few, women medical examiners in \u201972, when I started. That was an all-male profession, and that\u2019s changed, too. </p> <p><strong>Why did you pick the fashion world for this book, for Alex\u2019s not quite-on-the-clock, getting-back-on-her-feet case?</strong></p> <p>In writing these novels, I\u2019ve always picked a world to go into to set as the backdrop, exploring some aspect of New York City. So, I\u2019ve been all over the place. I\u2019ve done the <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/\">public library</a>. I\u2019ve done <a href=\"https://govisland.com/\">Governors Island</a>. I\u2019ve done bones in the <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/\">Museum of Natural History</a>. It makes it more interesting for the reader. You\u2019re not reading these books to be educated, but they\u2019re not car chases and shootouts and people committing crimes for no reason.</p> <p>So, I had my eye on the Garment District, the physical area, and the business of it. New York is the US fashion capital, on par with Paris, London, Milan. I did not want to do a book about a beautiful model who\u2019s vulnerable to sexual assault on the designer\u2019s couch kind of thing. You see a lot of mysteries like that. </p> <p>What fascinated me was the business side of it. I just had no idea about the numbers. I really did not stop to think of the global impact, of how big these New York businesses are, around the whole world. I never thought of Muslim women and haute couture, and if you just Google those two words, you could read all day. So, there was so much to drive the business end of it.

  "<p>A species of island fox unique to California has been removed from endangered species protection after a rapid recovery that the federal government says is the fastest of any mammal that has been placed on the in-danger list.</p> <p>The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has delisted three subspecies of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/island-fox.htm\">island fox</a> \u2013 endemic to the San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz islands \u2013 just 12 years after they were granted endangered species protections due to a catastrophic 90% population loss.</p> <p>The island fox is one of the smallest canids in the world, around the size of a domesticated cat. They are thought to have evolved on the channel islands, located off southern California, over the past 6,000 years and initially thrived due to a lack of predators, feasting on mice, crickets and the occasional crab.</p> <p>However, the island fox suffered badly during the late 1990s after use of the pesticide DDT wiped out bald eagles on the islands. Golden eagles, which prey on the foxes, quickly replaced the fish-loving bald eagles, leading to numerous fox deaths. </p> <p>This change, combined with a viral disease that swept through the fox population, led to a crash in numbers. At one point, Santa Rosa island had just 15 foxes, with another 55 on Santa Cruz.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AUPL9Sz5-Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7AUPL9Sz5-Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Following federal listing in 2004, island foxes were bred in captivity and a new vaccination was given to the remaining population to protect them from disease. Golden eagles were relocated, feral pigs were dispatched and bald eagles were reintroduced. As a result, fox numbers have rebounded \u2013 there are now about 700 of them on San Miguel island, 1,200 on Santa Rosa island and 2,100 on Santa Cruz.</p> <p>\u201cThe decline of the island fox, one of America\u2019s rarest mammals, was rapid and severe,\u201d said Jon Jarvis, director of the National Park Service. \u201cCaptive rearing, an unprecedented emergency action, was critical to saving the species. Efforts to restore balance to the island ecosystem ensured their survival.\u201d</p> <p>Federal officials said the effort, which involved conservation groups including the Nature Conservancy and Institute for Wildlife Studies, is the most rapid delisting of a mammal in the 43-year history of the Endangered Species Act. The Santa Catalina Island fox will remain on the list, although is now considered threatened rather than endangered.</p> <p>The delisting of the island fox means that under the Obama administration, 19 species have recovered enough to be removed from federal protection. Other rebounding species <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/louisiana-black-bear-removed-from-endangered-species-list\">include the Louisiana black bear</a>, which gained fame after President Theodore Roosevelt refused to shoot one, and the Steller sea lion.</p> <p>Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, said these recoveries showed that the Endangered Species Act is an \u201ceffective tool to protect imperiled wildlife\u201d. But some critics of the legislation argue that it is too narrow and only intervenes once a species is close to being completely wiped out.</p>",

When asked how he would hope to extract tactical analysis from Alan Shearer while largely in the buff, Lineker\u2019s velvet voice turned steely. \u201cDoing the entirety of the show in my pants would become a bit farcical,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This moment has been in the offing since December, when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garylineker/status/676520648097865728?lang=en-gb\">Lineker tweeted</a> that he would present the venerable highlights show in \u201cjust my undies\u201d if his beloved Leicester City won the league.

That said, I think there\u2019s something of the unknown about the Premier League now.</p> <p>\u201cLook at the other European leagues and there are one or two likely challengers for the title. In our league this season, there are quite comfortably five or six. Plus we\u2019ve had an influx of the world\u2019s big-name managers and are starting to attract big players too. It\u2019s astonishingly difficult to predict a winner.\u201d</p> <p>When asked to complete the phrase \u201cthe Premier League is the _____ league in the world,\u201d Lineker replied: \u201cRichest.\u201d</p> <p>The former Everton and Spurs forward\u2019s potential trouser-free appearance comes in the week that his fellow BBC presenter Helen Skelton was chastised for her choice of clothing during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/12/bbc-olympic-coverage-review-smart-background-films-skirt-scandals-and-007\">Olympics coverage</a>. Via traditional and social media, critics claimed that her skirt was too short, despite the fact that it was longer than the shorts worn by her colleague Mark Foster. While Lineker professed to being ignorant of the specific furore, he said controversy was becoming all too easy to generate.</p> <p>\u201cThere is Twitter outrage at everything,\u201d he said. \u201cBe it a pair of trousers or a short skirt, somebody, somewhere will not like it. It\u2019s best completely ignored. It will just be some silly keyboard warrior taking umbrage, often just to troll. I\u2019ve got about 5 million followers on Twitter and if I tweet anything there will be faux outrage. What you learn is that you can\u2019t please everyone all the time. But, for the press, this outrage is sometimes quite useful.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, back to the matter in hand. Lineker has always been renowned as a remorselessly dedicated athlete and posted Instagram photos of himself in the gym ahead of this weekend\u2019s date with under-fate. Was not even a small part of him looking forward to baring his bod for the nation? \u201cYou are joking aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo, it\u2019s terrifying!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Lineker\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BI-HD8UACWL/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prep #MOTD #pants #gym #thatprotein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Gary Lineker (@garylineker) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-08-11T13:42:01+00:00&quot;&gt;Aug 11, 2016 at 6:42am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Lineker</figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Gary Lineker will be presenting Match of the Day on BBC1 on Saturday at 10.30pm </em></p>",
  "<p>A six-year-old boy in Philadelphia is in critical condition after being struck in the crossfire of a gun battle that left at least four people injured.</p> <p>The boy, Mahaj Brown, was hit with at least 10 bullets, but is expected to recover despite wounds to his left leg and chest. Police said more than 50 shell casings have been recovered from what they describe as a \u201crunning gun battle\u201d. Multiple buildings and vehicles were also damaged in the incident. It is believed that at least one of the gunmen was wielding an AK-47 assault rifle during the shooting in the city\u2019s Germantown neighborhood.</p> <p>\u201cHe was going home to go to bed, from his grandmother\u2019s house to his mother\u2019s house. And to get caught with assault rifles?\u201d Mahaj\u2019s grandmother Delores Melendez <a href=\"http://6abc.com/news/boy-6-critical-after-gun-battle-erupts-in-germantown/1466896/?utm_content=buffer9bb34&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer#gallery-1\">told ABC 6 in Philadelphia.</a> Mahaj was in a car with a 32-year-old man that family identified as the boy\u2019s godfather when the shots began. The 32-year-old was also struck, treated and released from the hospital.</p> <p>Melendez said the boy remained conscious through the entire ordeal and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was shot. I can\u2019t believe I was shot.\u201d</p> <p>The shooting marks the second time a young child has been seriously injured by stray gunfire in the city just this week. On Tuesday six-year-old Anila Garrick was <a href=\"http://6abc.com/news/surveillance-video-captures-shooting-that-injured-girl/1463538/\">hit by a bullet as she played in front of her home.</a> Garrick remained at the same children\u2019s hospital where Brown was being treated on Friday morning, and doctors said she is recovering rapidly. Although surveillance footage was released by police in the Tuesday shooting, no suspects have been identified in either incident. </p> <p>The predominantly black neighborhood of Germantown has struggled, not unlike other neighborhoods in the city, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/02/philadelphia-police-related-deaths-plunge-reform\">maintain productive relationships between police and residents</a>. This often leads to few criminal leads in cases like this where residents may be hesitant to tip police off to the possible identity of the shooters.</p> <p>\u201cSpeak up and say something,\u201d Melendez said. \u201cPeople\u2019s children are dying for no reason. My grandbaby is up there suffering for what? He did nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike many large US cities like New York and Washington, which saw large upswings in violent crime during the late 1980s and early 1990s, followed by precipitous drops during the late 90s, Philadelphia\u2019s homicide rate has been relatively stable over the past 30 years. The city has seen an average of more than 320 homicides a year over the last decade. </p>",
  "<p>I went to quite a progressive school and, as such, spent time as a kid learning about other cultures and beliefs. Whenever we finished a new unit we\u2019d get an extracurricular treat. After learning about north Africa, someone served me my first bowl of couscous. If we were really lucky, we\u2019d get to watch a movie. But it was always the same: first, the thrill of dimming lights and a hush over the room; then, the inevitable realisation that while this was better than classwork, the \u201cenrichment\u201d film was still a little lame.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t thought about any of this in decades, but it came whooshing back during Kubo and the Two Strings. Somewhere in an alternate universe, a mini version of myself, after learning about Japanese culture and Shinto beliefs, ends up seeing this animated feature as a reward and is only mildly happy about it.</p> <p>The story is as by-the-numbers as they come. Kubo, a young boy with a gift for origami and playing the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWJrMA3zJ5o\">shamisen</a>, is a \u201cchosen one\u201d. He is the grandson of the jealous Moon King, but his mother left the immortal realm when she fell in love with a samurai. Her evil sisters are out to get Kubo, hoping to steal his second eye (he\u2019s already lost his first one), and when things get rough one night, Kubo\u2019s mother uses the last of her magic to send her young son on a quest. Joined by a talking, nannyish monkey (voiced by Charlize Theron), he must find three totems \u2013 a sword, a helmet and a breastplate \u2013 that will help him, er, help him do something. I can\u2019t remember, because this movie really is incredibly boring.</p> <p>Along the way, Kubo and the monkey meet Beetle (Matthew McConaughey), an insect warrior reminiscent of Kristoff from Frozen, in that he\u2019s a lovable dope. The three overcome some odds and eventually win the day, in a remarkably slow and uneventful manner. This affords them plenty of opportunity to talk about death, which is what every kid looks for in a summer cartoon film. Some of the scenes that show Shinto (or Shinto-inspired) rituals concerning deceased elders and the acceptance of mortality are, admittedly, interesting, but I\u2019m not inclined to give a pass to a family film that indoctrinates an irrational belief system just because it\u2019s novel. It\u2019s one thing to say \u201cthis is what some people believe\u201d, but another to say, as this film does, \u201cthis is the way\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vex0gPFnBvM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vex0gPFnBvM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Kubo and the Two Strings trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Shockingly, Kubo and the Two Strings doesn\u2019t even have much going for it on a visual level. Laika studio\u2019s first feature, the marvellous 2009 picture <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/07/coraline-film-review\">Coraline</a>, was remarkable in its tactile, handmade approach. But in the intervening years \u2013 following the quite good <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/13/paranorman-review\">ParaNorman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/the-boxtrolls-review-animated-childrens-film\">The Boxtrolls</a> \u2013 a problem has arisen. Laika\u2019s animation technique has become, counter-intuitively, too good. If you came to this with no previous knowledge of the studio\u2019s mission statement, you\u2019d likely think this was a typical 3D computer-animated project, and not the result of a time-consuming, homespun process involving small puppets and stop-motion photography. I had to check YouTube for some behind-the-scenes marketing materials to confirm the studio hadn\u2019t made the leap to CG images. Perhaps we\u2019re nearing a singularity, where the digital renderings of mega-processors have knocked the wonder out of us, and \u201creal\u201d animation now only looks impressive when it is demonstrably less than perfect, as in something like Coraline or Ji\u0159\u00ed Barta\u2019s marvellous 2009 film Toys in the Attic.</p> <p>I don\u2019t enjoy being a stick-in-the-mud about Kubo and the Two Strings, but I am being realistic. Little kids will be bored, as there are only a few scenes with any action, and of those, only one, featuring an enormous skeleton with swords sticking out of its skull, has any oomph. The creature design isn\u2019t that spectacular either, save for a quick look at a Forgotten Realms-ish <a href=\"http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Beholder\">beholder</a>. Older kids, except for a few teacher\u2019s pets, will soon realise that this is hardly a fun action-adventure cartoon at all, but a plate of vegetables. That isn\u2019t to say the animation market should live on Minions alone, but for its intended audience, it\u2019s unlikely these two strings will resonate. </p> <ul> <li>Kubo and the Two Strings is released in the US on 19 August and in the UK on 9 September</li> </ul>",

Last week in Virginia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/william-chapman-shooting-officer-stephen-rankin-guilty\">a rare manslaughter conviction was handed down in the case of a police officer, Stephen Rankin,</a> who killed William Chapman, an unarmed black 18-year-old accused of shoplifting in Portsmouth in April last year.

  "<p>My father, Maurice Bound, who has died aged 103, decided on a career in teaching because he was inspired by a great teacher from his own schooldays.</p> <p>Maurice was evidently a good teacher himself, because in 1958 he was asked to become head of a new secondary modern school in Baughurst, Hampshire. The Hurst had many pupils from families who worked at the newly opened Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston. It was the time of the cold war, and Maurice became involved in the Civil Defence Corps \u2013 a civilian volunteer force established to assist in the event of a national emergency \u2013 in the nearby village of Tadley.</p> <p>Born in Southampton, Maurice was the son of Julia (nee Masters) and Percy Bound. His father worked for the grocery wholesalers Misselbrook &amp; Weston and later set up his own grocery business. Maurice studied chemistry at Southampton University and in 1937 took up a teaching post at Ermysted\u2019s grammar school in Skipton, North Yorkshire. At Skipton Amateur Operatic Society he met Joan Williamson. They married in 1939, just before the outbreak of the second world war. They went on to have a daughter and three sons, and to foster two boys, Gordon and Trevor, for a number of years.</p> <p>Although Maurice was in a reserved occupation during the war, he and Joan operated an air raid information centre in Skipton \u2013 mainly because they had a telephone in their house. During the early part of the war, Maurice worked for Rolls-Royce as a quality control manager, overseeing production of some of the new Merlin engines. By 1943 he was in the RAF Volunteer Reserve (administrative and special ops) and was posted to Egypt. On the way there, his ship was torpedoed. Maurice survived and became a member of a bomb disposal group in the northern desert.</p> <p>Demobbed in 1946, he returned to teaching, first in Skipton, later in Skegness, and then in Braunton, Devon.</p> <p>After 14 years at the Hurst, Maurice retired in 1972. He then spent three years as vice-principal of a secondary school in Maiduguri, northern Nigeria. For 50 years, he was a lay preacher for United Reformed and Methodist churches, and stepped down from that only last year. His faith gave him great strength throughout his life.</p> <p>On their return from Nigeria in 1975, Maurice and Joan settled a few miles from Baughurst in the village of Silchester, where Maurice became treasurer of the local Roman museum. Later they returned to Tadley, and spent time with their extended family. After Joan\u2019s death in 2003, Maurice continued his work with the church and museum, and remained fiercely independent. He celebrated his 100th birthday in style with a party at the local golf club, which he organised himself.</p> <p>Maurice is survived by his daughter, Angela, his three sons, Michael, Jonathan and me, six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>There have been many proposed solutions to the problem of police brutality \u2013 everything from independent prosecutors and increased federal oversight to the complete disbanding of police departments. The release this week of the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/baltimore-police-department-justice-department-investigation-findings\">report</a> about the Baltimore police department will only amplify these demands in the public dialogue about police reform.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/freddie-gray-decision-black-lives-matter\">The Freddie Gray decision signals black people are to blame for their own deaths | Brittany Packnett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What these solutions \u2013 which mostly focus on monitoring and policies related to individual officers \u2013 fail to do is establish functional systems of accountability which address the systemic nature of the problem of police brutality. For lasting change, Baltimore and other police departments must establish meaningful accountability of police to the communities they serve.<br></p> <p>This is because focusing on individual \u201cbad cops\u201d doesn\u2019t work. Law and custom have resulted in only the most egregious and extreme incidences of police brutality being held accountable \u2013 and even then, there aren\u2019t necessarily consequences, as we saw most recently in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/freddie-gray-decision-black-lives-matter\">the acquittal</a> of the cops in the Freddie Gray case. Thus, those believing the damning justice department report signals the advent of more criminal prosecution of cops will likely be disappointed.</p> <p>What does work? Deterrence. The goal must be to prevent future incidents of brutality, not only to mitigate past grievances. This means we must go beyond the DoJ report to dig deeper into the reality of how police accountability happens at a state and local levels.</p> <p>In the vast majority of incidents in which police officers are accused of wrongdoing, punishment is handed down not by criminal courts or the federal government, but the police department\u2019s internal disciplinary review board. When it comes to accusations of excessive force in police brutality, review boards in Baltimore have been exceedingly lenient in their punishments of most officers. </p> <p>The reason for this is obvious: those making the decisions are themselves police officers. In states that have enacted the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/04/24/the-police-officers-bill-of-rights/?utm_term=.e65858d6363b\">Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights</a> (LEOBR) legislation, internal review boards require that at least one member of the board be the same rank at the accused officer; this is not only police policing police, but friends policing friends. This LEOBR legislation makes it illegal for anyone but sworn police officers to lead primary investigations of alleged brutality or to serve on the internal review board. </p> <p>To illustrate how absurd this is in practice, if a police officer is accused of sexual harassment, it would be against the law to have an expert on sexual harassment weigh in on whether the police officer should be suspended or not, leaving this critical decision to fellow officers, who in many jurisdictions have no training or expertise on how to understand or address it, and who may have a personal relationship with the accused. After reviewing the practice of the Philadelphia police department, the DoJ <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ric-zai-inc.com/Publications/cops-w0753-pub.pdf\">ruled</a> that at least one member of the internal review board should be a non-sworn police officer. Yet in 15 states, including Maryland, that\u2019s legally impossible. </p> <p>While the DoJ report mentions these state laws, it does so only in passing. And in the past, DoJ officials have told us that these state laws are \u201cbeyond the purview\u201d of their investigation. This is concerning for grassroots folk in the Baltimore community who hope the report can be used to bolster their reform efforts. Many close observers, from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.joincampaignzero.org/contracts/\">left-leaning Campaign Zero</a><strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cato.org/blog/police-misconduct-law-enforcement-officers-bill-rights\">libertarian-leaning Cato Institute</a>, have seen the LEOBR legislation as a critical impediment to a fair process for making police officers accountable to the community when it comes to accusations of excessive force. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the Department of Justice report is weakest on this particular point, which is the most important aspect to meaningful police reform. The DoJ report provides meaningful information and outlines specific policies that are problematic, but it obscures the most critical principle: that giving communities power over the institutions that govern their lives is fundamental to systemic police reform.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

The show largely steers clear of engaging too much in current affairs, but can\u2019t resist a little dig at Trump when one Republican senator states that they are four years away from being able to run. When his colleague points out that Trump is running <em>this year</em>, the senator just shrugs it off. Even in this surreal world of politically fanatical aliens, Trump is considered too crazy for the Republicans.</p> <p>But, with the exception of Trump, BrainDead is a show that <em>embraces</em> crazy, both with the aliens and the politics (there\u2019s a \u201ctax prom\u201d that\u2019s so weird it has to be a real thing). Once the brilliantly obsessive Gustav joins Laurel in her investigation of the aliens, things get taping-red-solo-cups-to-your-ears crazy.</p> <p>The show steers away from painting one side as the bad guys, instead lambasting the whole US political system for their inability to put their ego (or fanaticism) aside and agree on anything. In one excellent montage, a Republican and a Democrat are both shown hitting online forums hard, going straight for the caps lock and spewing their crazy all over the internet. Two of the sanest characters in the show \u2013 Laurel and her love interest Gareth (which presumably is a much sexier name in America than it is in the UK) \u2013 are from opposing parties.</p> <p>The political gags aren\u2019t as cutting (or sweary) as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/veep\">Veep</a>\u2019s, nor is the supernatural menace as tense as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\">Game of Thrones</a>. The whole thing is as light as candyfloss, from the hilarious opening musical recaps (why doesn\u2019t every show do musical recaps?) to the end credits music which sounds like it\u2019s come straight from a 1990s Barry Sonnenfeld movie. One of the big bads is played by Tony \u201cMonk\u201d Shalhoub, which gives you an idea of how seriously you\u2019re supposed to take the whole thing. When a head explodes you don\u2019t look away in disgust, you laugh. There are some real shocks (in the words of the musical recap: \u201cMy God, you monsters, not the cat\u201d), but you\u2019ll be grinning while you gasp. The gore is camp, the tone is intelligently silly and the characters are thin but well defined \u2013 and Winstead finally has a role that allows her to shine.</p> <p>BrainDead is the perfect antidote to 2016, which has been a far too serious year. So let\u2019s poke fun at it.</p>",

She came to us in November 2015, with a pitch for a story about children from a very poor village in eastern Congo who were being systematically abducted and raped \u2013 and the authorities seemed incapable of stopping it. Clearly it was a story that needed to be told, plus she had funding to go to the DRC, which obviously helped.</p> <p>We spoke and emailed frequently over the following months as she visited the DRC to do the main part of her reporting, talking to the little girls and their families, to doctors, and to investigators about the corruption they were up against.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/kavumu-village-39-young-girls-raped-justice-drc\">The village where dozens of girls have been raped is still waiting for justice | Lauren Wolfe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Traumatic as the story was to report, it became even more stressful for Lauren once she was back in the US, as she tried to establish what she could make public without endangering her sources. There was also a long delay before the suspects were arrested, which was a real problem for us, since if there were no arrests, we couldn\u2019t publish. Worse, if there were no arrests, it would mean that the suspects were under protection \u2013 so the attacks would continue.</p> <p>In May Lauren decided to move things on by writing an opinion piece for the Guardian, pointing out the scandalous lack of action. The following morning, at 3am New York time, she received an email, saying the suspects were under arrest.</p> <p>The challenge in editing a piece like this is to pull together a mass of reporting and try to hammer a confusing set of events into a coherent, chronological narrative that reads like a detective story but brings out the humanity of the victims, and gives the reader a powerful sense of what it is like to be on the ground, trying to stop these horrendous crimes against a wall of indifference.</p> <p>The piece we finally produced was a harrowing read, but the heartfelt response on Twitter immediately reinforced our view that it was a story that had to be told.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ada0fae4b0f231200da2ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-belam\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T14:45:02.113Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weird internet throwback of the week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You\u2019ll see lots of people complaining on social media about restrictions around covering the Olympics this year. Unless you\u2019ve paid a squillion dollars for the rights to broadcast it, the IOC are extremely unhappy with people using clips on social media - including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-ban-gifs-vines-social-media\">the humble gif and the use of Vine</a>.

It's time for a blockbuster face-lift</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I feel a certain misunderstanding here. Con Air is a perfectly fun film, but it\u2019s not high art. What separates it from a film like Suicide Squad is that it is an unabashed B-movie. Outside of the work of Vin Diesel, Hollywood doesn\u2019t make low-brow, silly action fare any more. Nicolas Cage is partly to blame for this, as his turn in The Rock started the trend of celebrated actors taking on schlock parts to class up a genre film. Now, Michael Fassbender can star in a video game adaptation. The blurring of the line between high and low art has rendered everything an amorphous mass of bland mush.

And thus it is that just as his enemies are busy cheming and plotting to bring him down by fair means or foul as I type, Corbyn himself, Milne, McDonnell and his other allies are resorting to the same kind of dirty politics to stymie them.</p> <p>Politics at that level is a cruel and dangerous shark-infested environment (seeing as we're on the subject), and one would have to be naive to think that Corbyn is somehow managing to keep his nose clean and play fair.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/aug/12/guardian-social-a-live-look-at-the-weeks-news-from-trotsky-to-grilled-cheese#comment-81045343\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15229804\" title=\"View Tim Atkinson\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/15229804\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Tim Atkinson\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15229804\" title=\"View Tim Atkinson\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Tim Atkinson</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/81045343\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">12 August 2016 1:46pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Say what you want, I haven't seen him raise an insult against anyone since he became leader.

Knowing that they had briefed against you, deliberately undermined you and were half-openly planning to replace you.

Last week writer Kyle Chayka explored this phenomenon in an essay in <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification\">the Verge</a>, describing the way tech-led travel is homogenising what we consider to be the desirable hallmarks of any given destination. \u201cEverywhere you go, seemingly hip, unique spaces have a way of looking the same, whether it\u2019s bars or restaurants, fashion boutiques or shared office spaces,\u201d he wrote in a follow-up piece for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/hipster-aesthetic-taking-over-world\">the Guardian</a>, describing its key features as \u201creclaimed wood, Edison bulbs, and refurbished industrial lighting\u201d.</p> <p>Chayka dubs this style \u201cAirspace\u201d. Its function? Making a particularly elite demographic of global travellers feel comfortable and at home as they skip from city to city booking apartments on Airbnb, checking into the local co-working hub and meeting up with fellow \u201cdigital nomads\u201d for an ideas jam (or whatever) at the nearest coffee joint. </p> <p>It\u2019s a subject I\u2019ve thought about a lot in the past, travelling to different cities for Guardian Travel. While Chayka focuses on the aesthetic of Airspace and the way it has been driven by a group of people who \u201cmove through spaces linked by technology\u201d, I\u2019ve always thought more about how the people themselves could be defined. \u201cHipsters\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to cut it, nor are these simply the \u201cupper classes\u201d. I think it goes beyond the Silicon Valley kids too. A particular class is emerging in the world who aren\u2019t bound by location, and places \u2013 particularly cities \u2013 are evolving rapidly to accommodate them and their collective tastes. Airspace is a good first step in opening up a critical discussion about who these people are.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9aede4b0fe7550975118\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/guardian-readers\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T11:40:52.380Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Are Corbyn supporters delusional?

They really need to sit down and reflect on why they are losing voters, and not just since Corbyn. Scotland and the north are abandoning Labour in droves, not because of Corbyn but because of how Labour has acted prior to this.

Now I don\u2019t know if the two cooks know each other, but assuming they don\u2019t, the comparison is instructive. Reichl and Oglethorpe both plump for sourdough, cheddar and alliums, all in large quantities (thick slices of bread, mountains of grated cheese, and a medley of different coloured onions, garlic and leek, very finely chopped). And the recipes don\u2019t so much differ as compete. Oglethorpe combines his cheddar with a washed rind and some comt\u00e9, while Reichl adds both green onion and shallots to her veg. She also really pushes the boat out, adding butter on the inside of the bread, and mayo and extra cheese on the outside, because, as Food52 puts it, \u201cat this point, why not?\u201d Stella McCartney did an interview in October 2009, sitting in a west London cafe eating scrambled eggs on rye.

  "<p>We need to talk about Deodoro. As part of a strategy that was \u201caligned with the city\u2019s wider development plan\u201d the Rio Olympics bid committee proposed to stage the current Games in four different zones. Far from the city centre, Barra da Tijuca is at least a humming hive of activity, home to the athletes and media villages, as well as the aquatics centre, the velodrome and tennis arena, among other venues.</p> <p>Further east, between 40 and 90 minutes by coach, depending on the traffic, Copacabana served as a picturesque start and finishing point for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s cycling road races, while its famous beach is the location of a stunning bespoke arena for beach volleyball. Events such as sailing, rowing and marathon swimming have taken place, or will do, on or in its waters that are so beautiful to look at but not so pleasant to smell or swallow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/david-florence-richard-hounslow-rio-2016-canoe-slalom-silver-medal\">David Florence and Richard Hounslow claim Rio 2016 silver in canoe slalom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A short hop along the metro, just a little further along the coast, is another Olympic zone that needs little introduction. Maracan\u00e3 staged the opening ceremony in its iconic and eponymous local stadium and it is here the curtain will come down on the Games next Sunday. In the interim the area\u2019s Havelange Olympic Stadium is home to the track and field events, while the Olympic volleyball, water polo and archery are also being staged nearby.</p> <p>Finally, in the north of the city there is Deodoro. The home of a massive army base located between two favelas, it is without question the runt of the Rio 2016 litter. Sprawling, often difficult to access and with various venues several miles apart, it is quite evidently the place those sports nowhere else wanted have gone to die. If Deodoro were a racehorse you\u2019d do the humane thing: throw a blanket over it before erecting the screens and reaching for a shotgun.</p> <p>The venue for 11 different sports, almost all of them the kind entrants to the London 2012 ticket lottery were fervently hoping not to get, Deodoro is home to equestrian sports such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/dressed-to-thrill-charlotte-dujardin-begins-her-quest-for-the-perfect-round\" title=\"\">dressage</a>, show jumping and eventing.

In what is almost certainly the most damning possible indictment of any Olympic venue, it drew the short straw that is modern pentathlon.</p> <p>It was not meant to be like this. The 2009 vision for Deodoro suggested the whole point of having the Olympics spread over such a wide area was that it would force organisers to upgrade the transport network. While the famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/2016-olympics-games-metro-extension-delay\" title=\"\">Metro Line 4 to Barra</a> was finished just in time, the rest of this vision appears to have been pared back to the point of being abandoned. Deodoro was slated to house the sort of X-games style sports that would appeal to the youth and turn the heads of the next generation.

Their faith unshaken, the Republican nominee\u2019s superfans cheered him with religious fervor and, when he lambasted the media, turned to boo with no less passion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/secret-donald-trump-supporters-change-vote-election\">Secret Trump voters reverse their support: 'He seems to be insane'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the Washington pundits and pollsters wrote them off, there was a sense of circling the wagons. But hours earlier, Trump had made a rare admission. \u201cAt the end, it\u2019s either going to work or I\u2019m going to, you know, I\u2019m going to have a very, very nice long vacation,\u201d he told CNBC. If, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/donald-trump-republican-defections-susan-collins\">as every recent survey suggests</a>, he does indeed suffer defeat, it raises the question of what will happen to the 13.3 million people who voted for him in the Republican primaries and whether, ultimately, Trumpism can survive Trump.</p> <p>Several supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/trump-clinton-mental-stamina-florida-rally\">at Thursday\u2019s rally</a> \u2013 where raucous crowds punched the air and chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d and \u201cLiar! Liar!\u201d \u2013 told the Guardian they believed that he would only lose the election if it were rigged. Should that happen, some said they intended to remain engaged in politics, but more likely with a third party than with the Republicans \u2013 especially if that party were to revert to establishment figures such as Jeb Bush. That would pose a dilemma for Republican elders seeking to rebuild from the ruins of a potential landslide defeat.</p> <p>\u201cThe liberal media are trying to skewer the vote so we won\u2019t go out and vote,\u201d said Flora Reece, 47, a commercial analyst. \u201cWe know he\u2019s going to win. We know he\u2019s going to be the next president of the United States.\u201d</p> <p>And if he doesn\u2019t? Reece replied firmly: \u201cThere will be dead people who voted, non-registered people who voted. They bring immigrants here to vote for the Democratic party. The system is rigged.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s followers, who include many newcomers to politics, are not prepared to fade quietly into the background, added Reece, who is African American and a member of her local Republican party. \u201cPeople are too mad and too angry.

Right now you can\u2019t tell the difference between Democrat and Republican. We\u2019ve already planned to start a new party to bring independents, Democrats and Republicans together and take the White House back in four years.\u201d</p> <p>Melanie Parkham, 56, agreed: \u201cDonald Trump has totally exposed how corrupt DC is. I\u2019m sick of the Republicans too. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say they\u2019re going to leave the Republican party.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what would happen if Trump lost, Parkham replied: \u201cHell, we\u2019ll know Hillary Clinton had it rigged. I\u2019ll switch to independent. I have friends in their 40s and 60s who have registered to vote for the first time in their lives so they can vote for Trump. I\u2019ll make sure they stay interested.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s post-convention tribulations just prompted Time magazine to publish a stylised image of his head dribbling like hot wax beside a single word headline: \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4447985/inside-donald-trump-meltdown/\">Meltdown</a>\u201d. After his unwinnable fight with gold star family Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son died serving in Iraq, the candidate attempted to restore discipline last Monday with a major economic speech in Detroit.</p> <p> Yet by Wednesday, he had touched off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">another furore with an off-the-cuff comment</a> widely seen as inciting supporters of the second amendment to assassinate Clinton. A day later, he began repeatedly describing Barack Obama as \u201cthe founder\u201d of Islamic State. He finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-obama-isis-founder-sarcasm\">walked that back</a> in the early hours of Friday morning.</p> <p>As several polls showed the Democrat leading by double digits and beginning to threaten in red states such as Arizona, South Carolina and Utah \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/is-hillary-clinton-contesting-texas-not-really-but-she-is-trying-to-expand-democratic-influence-into-deep-red-territory/2016/08/10/9bf38ad8-5eb7-11e6-af8e-54aa2e849447_story.html\">her campaign is even prodding Texas</a> \u2013 more and more Republicans scrambled for the last lifeboats on the Titanic. Yet in Trump World, the prevailing narratives do not apply. Some supporters, for example, opined that Khizr Khan had been paid $375,000 to denounce Trump \u2013 an unproven claim perpetrated by rightwing websites \u2013 and was therefore fair game.</p> <p>Capt Terry Shields, 66, a war veteran who served in Vietnam in 1969-70, said: \u201cIt was a shame it was brought up by the father in the first place. I think it was a fixed deal. The biggest thing that worries me is the Muslims taking over. It\u2019s obvious that Obama is pushing them.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, Trump\u2019s comment about the second amendment was \u201call twisted\u201d by the media, he added, a view echoed by many at the rally in Florida, a critical swing state. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bccd74d669103ac12b7f378bf549f843bd0b944\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bccd74d669103ac12b7f378bf549f843bd0b944/0_230_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters cheer before a campaign rally at the Silver Spurs arena in Kissimmee, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters cheer before a campaign rally at the Silver Spurs arena in Kissimmee, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Thayer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s support base is, of course, no more a monolithic bloc than any other section of the electorate. Generalisations are perilous and pose a headache for post-election Republican strategists. Another military veteran, Brett Puffenbarger, 29, said: \u201cI jumped on Trump train fairly early on. He was the only GOP candidate who wasn\u2019t outright against gay marriage and legalisation of marijuana. He was socially liberal and fiscally conservative and that was a big draw for me.\u201d</p> <p>Sabrina Motes, 36, said: \u201cI\u2019m a Jewish American, I used to be a Democrat and I\u2019m college educated. I hate the stereotype that if you\u2019re college educated or Jewish you don\u2019t support Trump. I\u2019ve followed him in his business career and I believe he\u2019s what the country needs right now.\u201d</p> <p>But looking to the future, Motes, a pharmaceutical sales rep, added: \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump is the perfect candidate. There are things that can be learned from and things that could be done differently. Republicans were supposed to learn from Mitt Romney but I don\u2019t think they did.\u201d</p> <p>Allegations of rigging were widespread, even though a vote has not yet been cast, but few were willing to predict what kind of backlash there would be. Bob Kunst, 74, a registered but disaffected Democrat sitting behind a cardboard \u201cTrump v Tramp\u201d sign, said: \u201cRight now the anger is intense and if, God forbid, Trump loses, you\u2019re talking revolution. You\u2019ve just had a revolution in Britain with Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>But Charlie van Esler, 60, an investment products seller who supported Marco Rubio in the primaries, said: \u201cI have no reason to believe it would be a rigged election. I respect the democratic process. The idea that Trump supporters are rednecks and yahoos is disingenuous.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the arena, where Trump addressed thousands of (nearly all white) supporters, badges, hats, T-shirts and other merchandise were on sale. The Confederate flag was flying outside a stall run by Ariel Robb, a 26-year-old nurse, who insisted that its message \u201cis more heritage than hate\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He\u2019s the only candidate who says if he makes a mess, he\u2019ll clean it up.

He\u2019s a really intelligent man \u2013 and anything\u2019s better than Hillary.

I\u2019m trusting in God.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas Trump has a luxury home in Florida and beat local senator Rubio in the primaries, he fared less well in states such as Wisconsin. Earlier this week in Janesville, where post-industrial melancholy is evident in a closed car plant and eerily quiet downtown, House speaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/paul-ryan-beats-mini-donald-trump-challenger-in-wisconsin-primary\">Paul Ryan crushed a Trump-style challenger </a>in a congressional primary. It was an important victory for the party\u2019s establishment wing, which continues to battle far-right conservatives for Republican seats across the country, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/08/10/ryan-wins-big-for-establishment-but-alt-conservatives-can-still-cause-massive-headaches/?wpisrc=nl_daily202&amp;wpmm=1\">with mixed results</a>.</p> <p>Analysts dismiss the idea that, should Trump lose, a new wave of candidates will seek to emulate him in the 2018 congressional midterm elections. <a href=\"http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/history/people/faculty/alphabetical/richardson_heather.html\">Heather Cox Richardson</a>, an academic at Boston College and historian of the Republican party, said: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s racist and xenophobic supporters are going to break off and do low-level violence. The Republican party is going to go into a far more progressive direction, back to the party of Nelson Rockefeller, Dwight Eisenhower and Teddy Roosevelt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f8fdec380298145e6c37702dfaa47bec5834eba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f8fdec380298145e6c37702dfaa47bec5834eba/0_46_3010_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump (and anti-Clinton) flair on a supporter\u2019s hat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump (and anti-Clinton) flair on a supporter\u2019s hat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregg Newton/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a reinvention they\u2019ve done before. The Trump supporters who are motivated by economic factors will gravitate back in a heartbeat. The idea that a party is going to win again by tying itself to voters over 65 is suicidal. Hanging on to this man is suicidal. What surprises me is how many people in the Republican party think their fortunes would be worse if they renounced him. I think people who haven\u2019t, like Paul Ryan, are done.\u201d</p> <p>The Republicans could become the first party to lose the White House for three consecutive elections since the Democrats in 1988. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/04/democratic-republican-party-bill-clinton-hillary-us-election-2016\">A leading architect of the Democratic revival</a> was Al From, who said on Thursday: \u201cFirst the Republicans have got to develop an agenda that people want to vote for, not just a small sliver of the electorate.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got to become more libertarian on cultural issues to appeal to young voters. You have to express views in ways that convey you\u2019re open to other points of views, too. We weren\u2019t going to win pro-life voters in 1992 but they saw Bill Clinton and said: \u2018He\u2019s not a radical on this, let\u2019s look at what he says about other issues.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>From warned: \u201cIf the governors and party leaders don\u2019t take a stronger hand in shaping the party, it\u2019s possible there will be some sort of replacement party. There could be a realignment of the parties over the next two or three elections. With the Republicans it\u2019s more extreme because Trump has hijacked the party from the leadership. The leaders could take it back but it\u2019s possible a third party could emerge.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The GOP has been through these rough elections before, and they have emerged stronger and more unified quickly</p> <footer> <cite>Frank Luntz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That argument echoes the recommendations of a <a href=\"http://goproject.gop.com/\">Republican autopsy report</a>, conducted after the 2012 election defeat, which called for wider appeal to young people and racial minorities and an end to the party\u2019s anti-immigration stance. First the party could not bring itself to make that journey by passing a law in Congress \u2013 then Trump came along with his signature plan to build a wall.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.focuswithfrank.com/\">Frank Luntz</a>, a Republican consultant and pollster, also doubts that the maverick tycoon will have a long-term political legacy. He said: \u201cTrump has little formal statewide organisation \u2013 even now. He has loyalists, but they are disorganised. His campaign is being out-raised and outspent by ratios we have never seen in modern politics \u2013 and that\u2019s with just 90 days to go. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that this movement will continue beyond its leader. He has become the most unpopular political figure in America today.\u201d</p> <p>It would be foolish to write the Republican party off, Luntz added. \u201cThe GOP has been through these rough elections before, and they have emerged stronger and more unified much more quickly than prognosticators ever expected. The Goldwater debacle in 1964 led to Nixon\u2019s resurgence in 1968 and a 60% landslide in 1972.</p> <p>\u201cWatergate may have destroyed the GOP in 1974, but Reagan won by nine [percentage points] just six years later and by 20 [points] four years after that. The loss of George Herbert Walker Bush in 1992 was supposed to be the end of the GOP, but they won the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years just two years later. Republicans are a very resilient party, and it doesn\u2019t take long for them to recover.\u201d</p>",

Surely it was rather more incumbent on Boris, Mike et al to tell us just how they would effect the transition as they were the ones who were supposed to know why it was such a good idea. Instead, they have been allowed to get away with saying the EU is basically rubbish without coming up with any detailed plans for a workable alternative. David Cameron may have been an idiot for allowing the referendum in the first place and for running a crap campaign, but giving him a hard time for poor contingency planning is kicking a bloke when he\u2019s down.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>We might have learned a bit more about Brexit, other than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/01/no-10-brexit-means-brexit-tory-peer-lady-wheatcroft-lords-delay\">Brexit means Brexit</a>, if Labour was in better shape to mount an effective opposition to the government. As it is, the only thing the party is currently opposing is itself. If there were medals on offer for self destruction, Labour would have taken a clean sweep in every weight division.

For some reason, the Spaniards have absolutely no interest in the men\u2019s double trap shooting, the men\u2019s synchronised 3m springboard diving or the men\u2019s K1 canoe slalom \u2013 all of which I am willing to bet are getting blanket coverage back home in the UK. Instead, I have been reduced to watching the men\u2019s basketball qualifier between Spain and Brazil in which the hosts were, I gathered, shock winners by 66-65, and replays of Mireia Belmonte Garc\u00eda\u2019s bronze medal-winning swim in the 400m individual medley that completely failed to mention Britain\u2019s Hannah Miley getting nudged into fourth place. This failure in commentary meant that Spanish TV missed the biggest story of the Games so far: namely, that <a href=\"http://%20http//www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/37035068\">Britain are top of the hard-luck table for fourth-place finishes</a>. Such are the perils of jingoism.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>The sudden death of the 6th Duke of Westminster has inevitably focused people\u2019s attention on what happens to his \u00a39bn fortune. If the duke hadn\u2019t been the world\u2019s 68th richest individual \u2013 according to Forbes magazine \u2013 his death would probably have remained an almost entirely private family matter worthy of nothing more than a small \u201cnews in brief\u201d. Most attention has rightly been focused on how little inheritance tax the Grosvenors will be paying \u2013 about \u00a33.48p if the family\u2019s accountants have done their sums right \u2013 when those of us whose first name doesn\u2019t begin with Duke would have to pay 40% on \u00a38,999,350,000 (the first \u00a3650,000 of your \u00a39bn is tax free) which would give the Treasury a much-needed \u00a33,599,740,000: that would go some way to covering the extra \u00a360bn the government is having to borrow over the next four years to pay for Brexit. But few people seem to have given much thought to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/new-duke-of-westminster-hugh-grosvenor-inherit-fortune\">the new duke\u2019s two elder sisters</a> who appear to be inheriting only a couple of mill at best.

Trying to keep count of all his insults, contradictions and factual errors is a category error. In the past 24 hours alone, he has declared President Obama to be founder of Isis \u2013 he repeated this assertion on radio when the presenter tried to give him some wriggle room to back down, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-obama-isis-founder-sarcasm\">before saying he was being sarcastic</a> \u2013 and twice insisted that Thursday was in fact Friday, neither of which are in the typical presidential candidate playbook. So maybe we should start looking at Trump as he must unconsciously, if not consciously, be seeing himself: as a performance artist. Imagine you are a four-times bankrupted billionaire with time on your hands. What better way to fill the day than seeing just how many people you can upset and still stay in the game? And if you think you\u2019re frightened of him being president, just think how terrified he must be by now? He had imagined a bit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/may/05/a-century-of-dada-anti-war-artists-mainstream-con\">Dadaist</a> nonsense about building a 2,000-mile brick wall along the Mexican border would be enough to sink him. But no. Every time he ups the ante and says something more bizarre, his support grows. While he\u2019s only playing at being psychotic, real psychosis of the American dream takes shape. There must be a tipping point, but he hasn\u2019t found it yet.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested</strong>: Go fourth and multiply.<br></p>",
  "<p>A photographer who drugged and raped men after using Instagram to lure them to modelling shoots has been jailed for more than 11 years.</p> <p>Nigel Wilkinson, 43, met his victims on the photo-sharing app before inviting them to his house in Bristol for photoshoots in his mock studio. But once the men were in his home, he would ply them with alcohol and drugs, including Rohypnol, and then attack them.</p> <p>Wilkinson pleaded guilty at Bristol crown court to two counts of rape and three counts of administering a substance with intent to rape. He was jailed for 11 and a half years. He also admitted possession of the class C drugs Flunitrazepam, also known as Rohypnol, and Nitrazepam.</p> <p>The court heard that Wilkinson promoted himself as a male fitness photographer and set up a website called WilkoPhotography last summer. He would search for potential victims on Instagram and invite them to his house so he could help them put together a modelling portfolio. But during the photoshoots, he would render his victims \u201csenseless and incapable\u201d by giving them drinks, some of which were laced with sedatives.</p> <p>The court was told that he \u201cliked to take the masculinity of straight men\u201d and that his three victims had been left devastated by his crimes. The men often stayed at his home, where he committed sexual acts when his victims were in a drugged state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0517a41cad3e927d876740e348aac978a040a0dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0517a41cad3e927d876740e348aac978a040a0dc/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The home of Nigel Wilkinson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilkinson\u2019s home in Bristol, where he invited men on photo-sharing app Instagram to take part in shoots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Avon and Somerset police/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>DC Stacey Matthews said: \u201cOn the surface, Nigel Wilkinson was a photographer with an interest in male fitness models. In private, he was a cunning sexual offender who used his photography enterprise as a cover and catalyst for his deviant activities.\u201d<br></p> <p>The force began investigating Wilkinson in February when Kent police were called by the girlfriend of a 19-year-old man. She had received a text message from her boyfriend stating that he believed he had been drugged. Officers went to Wilkinson\u2019s home and found the man inside. He was taken to hospital and tests found traces of a sedative in his system. </p> <p>He attended a sexual assault referral centre for further tests and officers went to Wilkinson\u2019s home to arrest him in April. When they arrived, they discovered a 23-year-old man asleep on the sofa. He was also taken to hospital. There was evidence that the man, who attended the Bridge sexual assault centre in Bristol, had been drugged and raped. During the investigation, officers identified a third victim, a 19-year-old from Wiltshire, who was also found to have traces of sedatives in his system. None of the victims had any memory of the acts committed on them.</p> <p>During searches of the house, police found photographs of a variety of males, some of whom were naked, on Wilkinson\u2019s computer, as well as empty drug packets.</p> <p>Sentencing, Judge Michael Longman told him: \u201cYou wanted to have sex with as many attractive men as possible. All the victims were much younger than you and entrusted themselves to you. You abused the trust they placed in you.\u201d</p> <p>Police are continuing to investigate Wilkinson\u2019s background and want to speak to anyone who may have had contact with him through photography or dating websites. It is thought that due to the fact that the men had been drugged and left with no memory of events, there could be many more potential victims. Police say they expect the number of victims to run into double figures.</p> <p>PC Mike Steven said: \u201cThe circumstances of this case are truly horrifying. I\u2019d encourage any other victim of Nigel WIlkinson to come forward and speak to us. We\u2019re always here and ready to listen to, believe and respect victims.\u201d</p>",

What was it lurking in his imagination that cost him last year\u2019s title? And who\u2019s this gorilla bearing down every time Gadd throws a backward glance? The style will be familiar to Gadd regulars. Video, audio, images and onstage action are spliced at a bewildering pace.</p> <p>It\u2019s ruthlessly explicit: almost the first thing we see is footage of Gadd vomiting at the camera. But here, the grindhouse stylings tend towards something emotionally significant, edging ever closer as Gadd plays soundclips from sessions with his analyst \u2013 lip-synched on screen by two upside-down chins.</p> <p> There\u2019s no denying it\u2019s less purely entertaining than last year\u2019s triumph.

  "<h2><strong>Richard Ford</strong></h2> <p>My old mentor and friend Shelby Foote used to say that a person couldn\u2019t understand the United States without understanding the American civil war. As a Mississippi kid who was glad the south had lost the war (100 years before!) and who felt that slavery was a blight on American history we would do well to try to \u201clive beyond\u201d, I thought Shelby\u2019s insistence was a lot of hooey intended to prove the south\u2019s undeserved centrality to all things American. In my naive view, the south and \u201csouthern values\u201d were a garish anomaly, not typical of what America stood for \u2013 those values expressed in the Declaration of Independence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c58493e2e2db24ed96426a43c2c16b876234514d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c58493e2e2db24ed96426a43c2c16b876234514d/0_946_3378_4219/801.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Ford.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Ford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I maintained this view until I unexpectedly experienced the American right wing\u2019s irrationally hostile opposition to the Obama presidency. From questioning \u2013 completely without justification \u2013 Obama\u2019s birth and religion, to opposing virtually all Obama\u2019s policy initiatives, to slandering the president personally, to denying his actual right to hold office, the right wing formally and informally waged a campaign not only to discredit our legally elected head of state but, in essence, to erase him.</p> <p>Okay, I said I was naive; but this shocked me. And it puzzled me. What was it about Barack Obama that incensed the right to such bizarre extremes? Here is a superbly intelligent man, dignified and persuasively presidential, a good communicator, an exemplary \u201cfamily man\u201d, remarkably scandal free; he knows the US constitution, he was and is strongly supported by the other party. He in every demonstrable way has had the country\u2019s best interests clearly in his sight. One could disagree with him policy to policy. But the right\u2019s reaction was outsized and\u2026 well\u2026 mindless. And all these views \u2013 to get around to the point \u2013 are the views put forward by Trump, both today and for the past nearly eight years.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t just be his race \u2013 could it? \u2013 that set the right so against the president? Though, in America, one cannot \u2013 must not \u2013 ever discount the lowest sort of political urgings, and must never overlook race prejudice as a motive for most anything. If it quacks like a duck, etc.</p> <p>All of what I heard in the rightwing contumely, then and now \u2013 including Trump\u2019s stump speeches in the past week \u2013 certainly reminded me troublingly of the anti-integrationist, anti-black, so-called states rights \u2013 now hygienically rebranded as \u201cnativist\u201d or \u201cpopulist\u201d \u2013 calumny from my apartheid youth in Mississippi: the unrelenting attempt not just to disempower African Americans as political actors, but to extirpate them. How might I inform myself better about this growing sense of unease regarding the president\u2019s race being a primary consideration \u2013 acknowledged or unacknowledged \u2013 in the right wing\u2019s intransigence?</p> <p>Well, first, I thought, read about the civil war, the vast crucible of American race politics, the \u201cproving ground\u201d where vitriolic, mindless anti-black rhetoric found its full voice and first prominent advocates. And what was the best history of the American civil war? Everyone knew that \u2013 probably even Shelby Foote, who wrote two volumes of his own.

The eponymous antihero is a hypocrite and a conman. He has a patchy sexual past and a history of heavy drinking, yet sells himself as a convert to evangelical religion, teaming up with Sister Sharon Falconer, who leads impassioned revivals throughout the midwest. Manipulative and cunning, Gantry is driven to accrue wealth through religious hucksterism, but also power; he feeds off the roar of the crowd. He\u2019s a narcissist and a fraud who has left multiple ruined lives in his wake.</p> <p>The main difference between Gantry and Trump is that Gantry is portrayed as genuinely charismatic. Lewis\u2019s preacher gets his leg over figuratively and literally because, as a performer, he\u2019s mesmerising. Trump is not charismatic. He is artless and politically clumsy, and wears his egotism on his sleeve. Nor is Trump mesmerising, except in the sense that a train wreck is mesmerising. Gantry\u2019s success in pulling the wool over people\u2019s eyes is understandable: he has a silver tongue, and on stage he\u2019s larger than life. Trump can\u2019t string a single grammatical sentence together, and at the podium he is lumpen and awkward. As a fictional character, Gantry works, and Trump doesn\u2019t. As Mark Schorer, an American academic, observed: \u201cThe forces of social good and enlightenment as presented in <em>Elmer Gantry </em>are not strong enough to offer any real resistance to the forces of social evil and banality.\u201d Some things never change.</p> <p>\u2022 Lionel Shriver\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-mandibles-a-family-2029-2047.html\"><em>The Mandibles</em></a> (Borough).</p> <h2><strong>David Hare</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b2a606d305bf47371498ff354ce348a0bcb372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1b2a606d305bf47371498ff354ce348a0bcb372/842_541_3967_2380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Hare - photographed in his writing studio in North London Photograph by DAVID LEVENE For SATURDAY\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last December, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/08/trumps-repeated-claim-that-obama-is-accepting-200000-syrian-refugees/?tid=a_inl\">Donald Trump claimed </a>that President Obama planned to let 200,000 Syrian refugees into the US in 2016.

People on the internet like to claim that everything is a matter of opinion and all opinions are equally valid. But they\u2019re not. It\u2019s pseudo-democratic bullshit. As Lipstadt says in our film, \u201cThe icecaps are melting. And Elvis is dead.\u201d Opinions backed up by fact have more value than those that aren\u2019t.

Woodard explores the US as a cluster of 11 different cultures, some of which we share with our neighbours, Canada and Mexico. In order to understand Trump and his appeal, I think we can focus on Appalachian culture, which was exported from the Scottish borders in the 18th century, and was marked by an affinity for conflict and evangelical protestantism. These people had been trained to do battle in the Scottish wars, were later put to work in the coal mines, and are now out of work (the most evocative portrait of the lives these immigrants left behind and what they did when they got to America is in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/albion-s-seed.html\">David Hackett Fischer\u2019s <em>Albion\u2019s Seed</em></a>). Another intransigent American culture is that of the deep south, slaveholders who came to the US from the sugar plantations of Barbados and were much more hierarchical and ruthless than the slaveholders in Virginia.</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting and relevant nation, though, is New Netherland, founded in 1624, a partly Dutch nation, very diverse, not religious, but authoritarian and corporate (run by the Dutch West Indies Corporation).

An increasingly global, mobile and craven class, Lasch contended, isolates itself in its social networks and physical cocoons, a flight not only from daily experience in public spaces but a political abandonment of the working and middle class that also betrays basic democratic practices and values. Though they differ in temperament and outlook, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton personify versions of Lasch\u2019s self-protecting privileged class, whose careers and lives contribute to the breakdown of an inclusive, national democratic culture.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A man who made a fortune from golf courses, Trump now presents himself as the voice of the silenced white masses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Were he alive, Lasch might eviscerate these two very different elites, beholden to different privileged interests yet nonetheless falling over themselves to champion the \u201ccommon\u201d person.

Jesus,<em> </em>Barton explained, was not only \u201cthe most popular dinner guest in Jerusalem\u201d, and \u201can outdoor man\u201d, but a \u201cstartling example of executive success\u201d. \u201cHe picked up 12 men from the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an organisation that conquered the world.\u201d This may sound ludicrous, but it is also the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of America\u2019s long conflation of business with religion, and it speaks to the equally absurd rise of Donald Trump as a politician that somehow millions of Americans believe \u2013 in the face of astounding evidence to the contrary \u2013 will save them. It is a triumph of faith, indeed.</p> <p>Trump is fond of claiming in messianic terms that he alone can save America, and restore the American Dream. The historian who coined the phrase \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d in a book called <em>The Epic of America</em>, would, I suspect, disagree. In 1931 James Truslow Adams argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/american-dream-great-gatsby\">chasing the spectre of wealth</a> is what got America into the mess of the Depression; he carefully traced that ideology back to the 19th century, when there developed a \u201cnew conception of business as somehow a social and patriotic duty\u201d. This is the ideology into which Trump has tapped so powerfully: the idea that business success is itself a virtue to be ranked above all others, to be worshipped. (We must put aside, evidently, concerns over what kind of \u201csuccess\u201d Trump is precisely held to have achieved, and by what means.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The world Fitzgerald envisioned was one in which character was increasingly sacrificed for wealth \u2013 Trump\u2019s world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Faith in business was an idea much on the minds of Americans in the 20s, during the so-called boom presided over by three successive \u201cbusinessmen\u201d presidents, including Calvin Coolidge, who declared in 1925 that \u201cthe chief business of America is business\u201d. This idea was so widespread that it was itself the target of the bestselling American novel of 1922, Sinclair Lewis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/11/100-best-novels-babbitt-sinclair-lewis-robert-mccrum\"><em>Babbitt</em></a>. In its opening pages, George Babbitt gazes upon a bank tower and Lewis tells us: \u201cHe beheld the tower as a temple-spire of the religion of business, a faith passionate, exalted, surpassing common men.\u201d In 1926 Lewis\u2019s <em>Elmer Gantry</em> satirised the hypocrisy of selling religion, while a year earlier Scott Fitzgerald skewered the same attitudes when he said that Jay Gatsby was a son of God and must about \u201cHis Father\u2019s Business: the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty\u201d. The idea that someone in service to the American worship of wealth could through sheer force of will drive himself near to the top is at the heart of Fitzgerald\u2019s morality play. The world that he envisioned was one in which character was increasingly sacrificed for wealth \u2013 and that is the world that Trump embodies, and which he would like to rule.</p> <p>A decade after Barton said that Jesus was the best businessman of all, Lewis wrote <em>It Can\u2019t Happen Here</em>, a dystopian satire responding to the rise of fascism in Europe by imagining a populist demagogue who becomes a totalitarian president of the United States.

By that standard the world has never had a democracy. Political scientists such as Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, authors of <em>Democracy for Realists</em>, who study how democracies really work are repeatedly astonished by the shallowness and incoherence of people\u2019s political beliefs and the tenuous connection of those beliefs to their votes. Most voters are ignorant not just of current policy alternatives but of the most elementary facts about politics and history, such as the major branches of government or which countries have used nuclear weapons. Their opinions flip depending on how a question is worded: they say that the government spends too much on \u201cwelfare\u201d but too little on \u201cassistance to the poor\u201d, and that it should use \u201cmilitary force\u201d but not \u201cgo to war\u201d. When they do formulate a preference, they commonly vote for a candidate with the opposite one. Nor does voting provide a feedback signal on a government\u2019s overall performance. Voters punish incumbents for recent events over which they have dubious control, such as macroeconomic swings and terrorist strikes, or no control at all, such as droughts, floods or even shark attacks.</p> <p>Achen and Bartels suggest that most people correctly recognise that their votes are astronomically unlikely to affect the outcome of an election and so they prioritise work and family over educating themselves about politics. They use the franchise as a form of self-expression: they vote for candidates who they think speak up for their kind of people.</p> <p>\u2022 Steven Pinker is Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard and author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/better-angels-of-our-nature.html\"><em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/a-sense-of-style.html\"><em>The Sense of Style</em></a> (Penguin).</p> <h2><strong>Mark Lawson </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"857e26bc1bd021d9241c176aad4328b47b5c813a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/857e26bc1bd021d9241c176aad4328b47b5c813a/0_551_2945_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Lawson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Lawson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abigail Zoe Martin/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the horror of the Washington establishment, a gabby maverick with no record of political office uses his celebrity, in a depressed and paranoid America, to fuel a furious movement that threatens the hegemonies of politics, corporations and the media. Considering the insurgent unthinkable, they plot to stop him.</p> <p>The year is 1934, and Upton Sinclair, a well-known journalist and author, has sensationally won the Democratic nomination to be governor of California. Sinclair is now most remembered as the writer of industrial documentary novels such as <em>The Jungle</em>, set in the Chicago meat yards, and <em>Oil!,</em> which was adapted as the Oscar-winning movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/paulthomasanderson.drama\"><em>There Will Be Blood</em></a>. His most enduring legacy, though, has proved to be a quixotic bid for public office, which introduced two perversions \u2013 subsequently recurrent \u2013 of the political process. Sinclair\u2019s gubernatorial race was the beneficiary of one campaign innovation \u2013 the power of an anti-political candidate in times of crisis \u2013 and the victim of another: the use of negative media \u201cattack ads\u201d against an opponent. These tropes seem to have reached their apotheosis in the 2016 US presidential election.</p> <p>Ideologically, Sinclair most resembles Bernie Sanders. Both men were socialists who became Democrats for specific electoral purpose. However, in his takeover of a major party in a key campaign, Sinclair most spookily previews Donald Trump. Like Trump, he terrified the elders of his adopted affiliation and the media by being widely viewed as too peculiar to rule. Smeared as politically reckless (in his case, for \u201ccommunist\u201d views), Sinclair was attacked for his evangelical vegetarianism and tendency to speak from candour rather than calculation. The outsider\u2019s rise was seen as so threatening to the status quo that the incumbent Republican governor, Frank F Merriam, responded with a campaign that included the first recorded use of a hostile screen commercial, funded by Hollywood and screened in cinemas.</p> <p>Greg Mitchell\u2019s 1992 book about these events, <em>The Campaign of the Century</em>, although historical, has tended to find topical resonance. It was first published in the election year in which an independent presidential candidate, Texas oilman H Ross Perot, became the most successful non-politician presidential candidate until Trump. In 2011, it was released for the first time as an ebook, because, as Mitchell acknowledged in a preface, he saw, in the Occupy Wall Street grassroots movement, parallels with EPIC, and wanted to offer Sinclair as both a warming and warning example to the new wave of progressive protestors.</p> <p>As it turned out, the 1934 template had less relevance to the 2012 presidential election, when an incumbent president received a handsome re-endorsement, than had seemed likely in the febrile atmosphere leading up to the vote. <em>The Campaign of the Century</em>, though, proves a useful handbook to the present political convulsions in America, although liberals will read it now looking for clues to how a feisty outsider can be stopped.</p> <p>What ultimately finished Sinclair was that the intervention of a strong third party candidate, Raymond L Haigh of the Progressive party, split the anti-establishment vote and allowed Merriam to be re-elected, helped by the media touting him as the sensible or at least safer option.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that, in November, either the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or the ex-CIA agent Even McMullin, a last-minute anti-Trump runner, can do a Haigh for Hillary, spreading the resentment. The larger question, though, is which candidate will be left standing after the Trump and Clinton campaigns and their proxies have engaged Merriam-like negative tactics against each other.</p> <p>The American decision in 2016 sees the polarities of California 34 reversed \u2013 the maverick a regressive rightwinger, a Democrat running as the defender of sanity and capitalism \u2013 but the parallels are otherwise uncanny. Upton Sinclair, an unfairly neglected writer of political fiction, is a more lasting presence as a ghost in the political machine.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Lawson\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/allegations.html\"><em>The Allegations</em></a> (Picador).</p> <h2><strong>Oliver Burkeman</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfc6f8cefd235b9add7ce48efa2c7ffa88949430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfc6f8cefd235b9add7ce48efa2c7ffa88949430/0_1482_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Burkeman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Burkeman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Long before Donald Trump started<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\"> dropping hints about political assassination</a>s, death was a looming presence in his speeches.

The book\u2019s trio of authors \u2013 Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg and Tom Pyszczynski \u2013 have spent many years running experiments in which participants are reminded of their inevitable fate (\u201cPlease briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you\u201d, goes one typical mortality-reminder exercise) to see how it changes them. Their results endorse the hunch set forth with brilliance, but little scientific rigour, by Ernest Becker in his masterpiece <em>The Denial of Death</em>. Unable to accept the fact that our lives are finite, we seek symbolic immortality \u2013 often through child-rearing or creative work or devotion to great causes, but sometimes to demagogues instead.</p> <p>\u201cSensing a way to feel significant again,\u201d they write, \u201cpeople join the cause of the seemingly larger-than-life leader as a revitalised basis for self-worth and meaning in life.\u201d Whether he\u2019s conscious of it or not, Trump triggers the fear of death in his audiences, then presents them both with various specific \u201csolutions\u201d (a wall to keep out Mexicans, a ban to keep out Muslims) and one big implicit promise: merge symbolically with the wealthy, domineering Trump himself, and feel powerful again.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s popularity has been variously attributed to racism, misogyny and economic insecurity; but the authors show how all these only get their urgency from the unspoken, underlying fear of literal demise. And perhaps, in the end, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope in this. There\u2019s been a regrettable tendency among liberals to write off Trump supporters as utterly irredeemable \u2013 bigots we can never hope to understand, much less change.

All-American Dorothy and her charming sidekicks trip off to the dazzling Emerald City to seek help from the mighty wizard of Oz. The awesome eminence promises to give them everything they desire if they kill off his biggest (female) rival first. But when they return to claim their rewards, they discover that \u201cOz, the Great and Terrible\u201d is a cowering little ventriloquist from Omaha. \u201cAre you not a Great Wizard?\u201d Dorothy exclaims.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Not a bit of it, my dear; I\u2019m just a common man.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re more than that,\u2019 said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; \u2018you\u2019re a humbug.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Since the 1960s it has been fashionable to read Oz as an allegory of turn of the century populism: the yellow brick road represents the gold standard, the Emerald City stands in for paper dollars, and so on. One doesn\u2019t need period analogies to see a connection to the 21st-century populism of Trump, who blinds voters with sham opulence, terrifies them into submission, and promises to make their wishes come true.</p> <p>Dorothy is the real saviour of the book (Baum\u2019s wife, it\u2019s worth noting, was a prominent suffragist), but even when they\u2019ve exposed the wizard as a fraud, she and her friends turn to him for aid. \u201cHow can I help being a humbug,\u201d chuckles Oz the not-so-great, \u201cwhen all these people make me do things that everybody knows can\u2019t be done?\u201d</p> <p>A self-help reading might observe that the characters don\u2019t need a wizard to give them brains, heart, or courage. They just have to believe in themselves. A profound loss of faith among the white working class explains why today\u2019s Dorothy (and particularly her Uncle Henry) will probably vote for Trump.

But no issue has been more important to Trump\u2019s success than race. Trump has given vent to many white voters\u2019 fears and anxieties about the loss of racial privilege and status, and run the most avowedly ethnonationalist presidential campaign since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/civil-rights-anniversary-11-june-1963\">George Wallace</a>. And while many have argued that the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s racially coded appeals is tied to rising inequality and the economic woes of the working class voters who constitute Trump\u2019s base, it would be more accurate to say that Trump is tapping into a vein of working class racism that has been a part of American politics for a long time.</p> <p>That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stan-greenberg\">Stanley Greenberg</a>\u2019s <em>Middle Class Dreams </em>helps explain so much about Trump\u2019s rise. It was published in 1995, but much of it is based on Greenberg\u2019s work in Macomb County, Michigan, following the 1984 presidential election. Macomb was a nearly all white suburban county just outside of Detroit. It had been a solidly Democratic county in the 60s, giving sizeable majorities to both JFK and Lyndon Johnson. But in 1972 66% of Democratic voters in Macomb supported George Wallace in the Democratic primary, and in the general election Richard Nixon carried the county easily. In 1980 Macomb voted for Ronald Reagan, and in 1984 he took two-thirds of the vote. In other words, these working-class voters, who had once supported progressive candidates, had shifted decisively to the right.</p> <p>What Greenberg discovered in his many interviews with Macomb voters was that they felt that the Democratic party had abandoned them, that it had stopped paying attention to the concerns of working people and the striving middle class, and started paying too much attention to the concerns of black people and other minorities. The fundamental problem Macomb voters had with the Democrats was the party\u2019s embrace of civil rights in the 60s.</p> <p>What <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> demonstrates is just how important race, and racism, was in shaping many voters\u2019 political attitudes. As Greenberg puts it, \u201cthese white defectors from the Democratic party expressed a profound distaste for black Americans, a sentiment that pervaded almost everything they thought about government and politics\u201d. More than that, \u201cnot being black was what constituted being middle class; not living with blacks was what made a neighbourhood a decent place to live\u201d. When the Democratic party started to take civil rights seriously and to embrace (however tepidly) antiracism, many white working class voters saw it as a betrayal.</p> <p>More than 40 years after Wallace, Trump is tapping into these same currents. The list of outsiders that many white voters fear the encroachment of is longer now: it includes Muslim and Latino immigrants as well as African Americans. But what <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> shows is that the conviction of Trump supporters that white Americans have been forgotten, and that the country is going to hell as a result, is not new. It\u2019s all too old.</p> <p>\u2022 James Surowiecki is author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/wisdom-of-crowds.html\"><em>The Wisdom of Crowds</em></a> (Anchor).</p>",
  "<p>Musicians dislike the C-word \u2013 \u201ca career, no I never give that a thought,\u201d they will protest \u2013 but in the great Hungarian conductor Iv\u00e1n Fischer\u2019s case you suspect it is true. \u201cI never consider mountain peaks to be reached,\u201d he tells me in his soft, careful, accented English. \u201cIt has never been in my mind that I want to achieve certain things. If I achieved anything in terms of career, it was an accident.\u201d</p> <p>Fischer says he tries to avoid much of what being a high-profile conductor implies. \u201cAbout 90% of what a conductor represents are things I don\u2019t like. I just like a very small fraction of this profession, which is the music. The rest \u2013 the glamour, the power, the hierarchy, the routine of how to work with orchestras \u2013 is something I don\u2019t feel comfortable with. I never had a feeling that this was what I wanted to do. I bear it because I have to, but it\u2019s not something that attracts me. The last profession I would choose is conducting.\u201d</p> <p>We are meeting at Fischer\u2019s large, quiet house in a suburb of south-west Berlin. As well as being founder and music director of the <a href=\"http://www.bfz.hu/en/\">Budapest Festival Orchestra</a>, Fischer is now also music director of the <a href=\"https://www.konzerthaus.de/en/\">Konzerthaus</a> in Berlin. He has had one or two run-ins with Hungary\u2019s rightwing government recently, and living in Berlin with his wife and two sons gives him a bit of breathing space, though he remains utterly committed to his Budapest orchestra, which he will be bringing to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e6pn3d\">Proms on 26 August</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes when you go to a famous orchestra, you feel as if your only role is to be impressed by it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We are in a sitting room filled with Fischer\u2019s scores. A Beethoven sonata is open on his piano; he likes to play whenever he can. Fischer keeps his jacket on throughout the interview \u2013 very Mitteleuropean, not grand in that old maestro-ish way but still quite formal. He is 65: getting on in life but less so in conducting. In the past decade he has returned to composition, writing eclectic works for voices and orchestra. He says he wishes he had made the decision to balance conducting and composing earlier in his career.</p> <p>\u201cI came back to composing very late,\u201d he explains. \u201cConducting sucked me in. I won a conducting competition when I was 25 [the Rupert Foundation competition in London in 1976], and there were offers, offers, offers. Of course it felt like an attractive thing, because I thought: \u2018Maybe the next concert will be very enjoyable.\u2019 But even then as a 25-year-old I was purely interested in the music, and not the profession itself. The role of imagining and developing a piece and training a group is attractive, but not putting on tails and going out there.\u201d</p> <p>Fischer does very little guest conducting these days, though he has maintained his relationships with Amsterdam\u2019s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the Berlin Philharmonic. He only wants to work with great orchestras, I suggest, but he questions the term \u201cgreat\u201d and the assumption that conductors will want to cultivate them. \u201cPeople assume that conductors love to wave their hands in front of great orchestras. I don\u2019t belong to that club. The so-called great orchestras \u2013 the old, great orchestras \u2013 like to preserve certain musical values such as their sound. They think: \u2018This is us, this is our trademark.\u2019 Now a conductor comes and he has limited influence on the so-called great orchestra. So they attract conductors who love to wave their hands while not changing anything. Sometimes when you go to famous orchestras, you feel as if you are working with a prima donna singer who has her sound, and your only role is to be impressed by it. I would much rather go to an orchestra that is receptive to my ideas because I can then create something.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96ec8578bed924b1ea2c3c46ea345328bf81b3f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96ec8578bed924b1ea2c3c46ea345328bf81b3f4/0_62_1406_844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fischer campaigning in Budapest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fischer campaigning in Budapest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why carry on with, say, the Berlin Phil? \u201cI\u2019ve known them for over 20 years now. I know individually each one of them, they\u2019re wonderful musicians. I\u2019ve figured out a way to work with them, but it has its limitations. You would never want to do it long term.\u201d</p> <p>Better to work with your own orchestra, and that is what he has done with the Budapest Festival Orchestra, which he co-founded with fellow Hungarian conductor Zolt\u00e1n Kocsis in 1983. \u201cI believe in long-term work,\u201d says Fischer. \u201cIt\u2019s like a psychoanalysis that lasts a few years compared with a one-time consultation with a patient. After 30 years something serious starts. We know each other inside out; we trust each other; there is a complete confidence.\u201d</p> <p>What Fischer wants to avoid above all is a sense of routine. \u201cWe work with intensity and in a very personal way. It is more like the way a string quartet works. I don\u2019t say to the principal cellist: \u2018Please a little softer.\u2019 I would say: \u2018Come on Peter, what the hell are you doing?\u2019 It\u2019s a different communication, much more personal. I immediately notice when their level of focus or concentration is not what it should be. I work much more like a theatre director would work with actors.\u201d The fact that the great majority of the musicians in the orchestra are Hungarian and have emerged from the country\u2019s vibrant musical tradition adds to their sense of commonality of purpose.</p> <p>The Budapest Festival Orchestra is Hungary\u2019s greatest cultural export, but had its <a href=\"http://hungarianfreepress.com/2016/05/07/conductor-ivan-fischer-pays-the-price-for-his-criticism-of-orban-regime/\">grant from the city council</a> slashed recently, a move that was interpreted as punishment for Fischer\u2019s criticism of the country\u2019s authoritarian and nationalistic government. The \u20ac640,000 budget cut meant a reduction in the orchestra\u2019s outreach programme, which had sought to take music into schools and nursing homes. \u201cIv\u00e1n Fischer is beginning to lose his self-control,\u201d said Budapest\u2019s mayor, Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s, when the orchestra dared to protest about the budget cut.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gexnIbK-pJA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gexnIbK-pJA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch Fischer and the BFO perform the first movement of Mahler\u2019s Symphony No 1</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cWe get most of our subsidy from the state,\u201d says Fischer, \u201cand that is unaffected. I am very pleased that the government has maintained that support, which is worth about \u20ac4m. They understand the value of the orchestra to Hungary. What is interesting is the difference between the government and the city. One politician understands the value; another one doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Fischer says the city never explained the reason for the sudden reduction in subsidy in the middle of the orchestra\u2019s season. \u201cEverybody can cut subsidies, it\u2019s their right to do that, but we also have the right to protest. We arranged a big public demonstration, and many people came into the streets of Budapest. It was a fantastic wave of sympathy, and we hope the mayor will change his mind because this is not the policy of the Hungarian government.\u201d</p> <p>Though Fischer dislikes the reactionary nature of Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government and the growth of antisemitism in the country, he nevertheless feels he can do business with them. Unlike pianist Andr\u00e1s Schiff, who has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25450716\">vowed not to return</a> to his native Hungary in the current illiberal climate, Fischer is trying to work for change from within. \u201cIt\u2019s a country where you can argue, discuss, raise your voice, have differences of opinion, and I will keep criticising things which I disagree with.\u201d</p> <p>Fischer is Jewish, and his political views are refracted through his family experience. His grandmother was killed in Auschwitz; his grandfather was beaten to death in Buchenwald; his parents had to hide out in Budapest for the duration of the war. \u201cDo we really want to go back to this nationalist past, where nations turned against each other and religions turned against each other?\u201d he asks. \u201cThis is the history of Europe, and the reason I believe in the integration of Europe, so that finally we become a family of nations who have peace with each other. That is more important than anything else.\u201d Music, he believes, can help bring that dream about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b22cec9844ab7afa4e68d8846846b8be57f44d97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b22cec9844ab7afa4e68d8846846b8be57f44d97/0_871_3732_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andr\u00e1s Schiff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pianist Andr\u00e1s Schiff has vowed not to return to Hungary in the current political climate.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the challenges of Hungary\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/orban-says-he-seeks-to-end-liberal-democracy-in-hungary\">illiberal democracy</a>\u201d (Orb\u00e1n\u2019s chilling phrase) and the fact Fischer prefers Berlin as a tolerant place in which to bring up his children and where he enjoys his job in the city, he anticipates working with his Budapest orchestra for the rest of his life. The orchestra he founded is his lifelong passion; he also sees it as a \u201claboratory\u201d for orchestras of the future, offering flexibility, openness and a group of players that he encourages to develop as portfolio musicians rather than spending their lives as fixtures with the orchestra.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are a member of the Budapest Festival Orchestra, the great thing is that you are allowed a much more versatile musician\u2019s life,\u201d he explains. He wants \u201cindividualists\u201d rather than \u201cobedient, uniform soldiers\u201d. \u201cFor the future of music, it is better to develop the symphony orchestra as a more flexible organisation that can embrace other musical styles. Now, we have a symphony orchestra that looks more or less like the one in Richard Strauss\u2019s time. It\u2019s already 100 years old. I don\u2019t really think it will stay the same 100 years from now. The idea of a symphony orchestra must develop over time or it will become a museum.\u201d</p> <p>He wants his ensemble to be able to play everything. \u201cThe conventional symphony orchestra leaves baroque repertoire to the period instrument orchestras and contemporary music to the specialised groups,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we encourage the individual interests of musicians, we have a period instrument part of the orchestra, we have a chorus, we have a group playing Transylvanian folk music, another group working on jazz improvisations.\u201d</p> <p>The aim is to keep both musicians and audience on their toes. He is known for his innovations: concerts where the audience chooses the pieces, which means they are played without rehearsal; encores in which the orchestra abandon their instruments and sing instead; operas where he does the staging himself (admittedly with mixed results). Every convention must be challenged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2015/sep/04/top-10-orchestra-conductor-bachtrack-list\">Today's top orchestra and conductor?

And she is still a child. I strongly believe people should be responsible for their actions, but I also believe they should be allowed to grow into those responsibilities first.</p> <p>If you forget, for a moment, about the way your daughter has gone about things, and concentrate on what you think she might be trying to communicate to you, what do you think that might be?

  "<p>There is a certain kind of person who just takes to summer. When the mercury rises to heatwave proportions, they wholly embrace the scorching rays, casually shedding some (though not, all) of their clothes to reveal a glowing body. If they are not dark already, an hour in the sun sees their skin immediately turn a gorgeous nut brown, dotted with constellations of attractive freckles. They glide, scented, through air as thick and sticky as hot soup, exuding cool, never wilting. They stop wearing shoes and take wholly to nature, letting their salted hair flow untamed and beachy, for they are a child of the seasons. They are the gods and goddesses of our endless picnic days. Summer literally becomes them.</p> <p>I am not a summer person. I am the person sitting pink, sweaty and panting on someone else\u2019s wall, gulping down water, as my vision goes fuzzy and black in the corners. Don\u2019t get me wrong: many of us non-summer people adore summer, it is just that summer does not adore us. How and why does it hate us? Let me count the ways.</p> <h2><strong>Sunburn</strong></h2> <p>British people are infamous for their strict adherence to the motto \u201csun\u2019s out, buns out\u201d, immediately opting to tear off all their clothes the minute there is a hint of hot weather. These people sneer at factor 30, crying: \u201cPass me the baby oil, base tans are for losers!\u201d Flash forward two hours and the curse of the lobster is upon them, yet there they are, bravely trying to soldier on, sipping on a Grolsch and trying to act casual (note: this is impossible when severely sunburnt).</p> <p>Those of us who have come to terms with the Celtic pallor of our skins have usually learned our lessons the hard way and now take preventive measures that some may call extreme. We are the people who, on discovering a beautiful, unspoilt stretch of white sandy coastline offset by a turquoise sparkling sea, will say, \u201cRight, let\u2019s find some shade.\u201d This, despite the fact that we are in long sleeves, a sun hat, shades, slathered in sunblock and carrying a parasol. In the absence of said shade, we are forced to lie bathed in sweat under a towel, groaning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42e2b1d0b6b918f120695168ac37998147fe6108\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42e2b1d0b6b918f120695168ac37998147fe6108/554_556_3790_2274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman with sunburn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brits are infamous for their strict adherence to the motto \u2018sun\u2019s out, buns out\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Allergies</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s a glorious summer\u2019s day, but are you able to enjoy it? No, you are not, for the pollen count is dangerously high, and your eyes and nose are streaming so much that, while you can hear the clink of ice in cider glasses (a conceit Brits have adopted entirely uncritically from television advertising), you can hardly see all the beautiful people enjoying themselves around you in the beer garden, unhampered by pintloads of mucus. On top of this, your eyeballs are on fire and you ran out of non-drowsy antihistamines so you\u2019re falling asleep in your seat, possibly for ever, because you heard they don\u2019t mix well with the copious amounts of ros\u00e9 you convinced yourself you needed to numb the ache in your sinuses.</p> <p>You dream of spending one of those idyllic summer days pootling along country lanes in a vintage car, only to pull over next to a spectacular cornfield teeming with wildflowers for picnicking, frolicking, etc. But such cinematic moments are sadly denied you, the hayfever sufferer. Quite frankly, you\u2019d rather do the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43eMCobo15c\">Bez dance</a> through a minefield.</p> <h2><strong>Sweating</strong></h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am actually shining. I am a reflective surface. You could do cocaine off my forehead \u2013 only it would stick</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHow can it be?\u201d you ask yourself, as you stand in front of the mirror glistening. \u201cSummer is supposed to make everyone infinitely more attractive in preparation for long, lusty, jasmine-scented evenings of seasonal shagging. Instead, I look uglier than I have ever looked. I am actually shining. I am a reflective surface. You could do cocaine off my forehead \u2013 only it would stick, like everything else touching any part of my body. I seem to have developed a moustache composed entirely of moisture.\u201d</p> <p>Sweating is in many ways a form of labour. There\u2019s the cost and annoyance of always having to pack a second T-shirt, the time-consuming act of always having to check the chair after sitting in it, and the humiliation of asking your colleagues whether they have any deodorant. And that\u2019s before you even get to other people\u2019s sweat. Anyone who has taken public transport during rush hour in August will know the unique horror of being penned in on all sides as a man\u2019s forehead drips on to your bare skin like Chinese water torture.</p> <h2>Chafing</h2> <p>For those women without a \u201cthigh gap\u201d (about 95% of us), summer is a time when walking anywhere in extreme heat will see your inner thighs rubbing together like a pair of oiled, wrestling piglets, resulting in \u201cchub rub\u201d \u2013 a humiliating condition not unlike nappy rash that results in friction burns and searing pain. Along with thrush, chub rub has to be up there on the list of Bullshit That Women Put Up With\u2122 that only gets worse in summer.</p> <h2><strong>Insect bites</strong></h2> <p>If you\u2019re the kind of person who wakes up in a room you\u2019ve shared with eight other people to find yourself the only one covered in insect bites, then summer is a terrible time for you, my friend. And I feel your pain. I don\u2019t know what it is they love about us (our skin, our blood, our sheer, winsome chemical magnetism), but love us they do, and as a double whammy, we will often suffer from a physical overreaction to said bites. I have had bites bigger than my own face, on my face. Once, on holiday in Greece, I had a bite on my eyelid that made it look as though I had been beaten up, making breakfast in a local taverna very awkward for my boyfriend, who was forced to make a quick exit before becoming the victim of a vigilante justice mob.</p> <p>I am that person begging Canadian tourists for antihistamines in a hotel lobby, after being told by a Cuban doctor that a pus-filled bite on my thigh meant I could develop encephalitis and die. Try putting a hazy Instagram filter on that.</p> <h2><strong>Fainting</strong></h2> <p>An Italian friend of mine told me recently that his ideal temperature is 38C, a statement the mere hearing of which made me want to go and lie down in a dark room in my pants. Take it from someone who has regained consciousness in the back of a van full of ripped French firemen (they send les pompiers in very tight polo shirts for medical emergencies) and did not enjoy it: there is such a thing as too hot, and for me, that is around the 27C mark. Anything higher will bring on an attack of the vapours. Pathetic, I know, but there we have it. Hot weather turns me into a Victorian lady in need of a six-month convalescence on a chaise longue in a stately home in order to feel strong enough to even think about getting back on my horse.</p> <h2><strong>Bad hair</strong></h2> <p>You know those summer babes, with their beachy, salt-sprayed hair. All they\u2019ve done is gone for a wild swim and run their fingers through their locks afterwards, and yet they look as if they have strolled off the pages of a siren-themed Vogue photoshoot. Meanwhile, the humidity has turned your barnet into a nest of mad frizz, while your now-vertical fringe has developed a multitude of strange kinks. Somehow, the weather has resulted in your having a cowlick, a perm, and a widow\u2019s peak all at once.</p> <h2><strong>Sleeplessness</strong></h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You toss, and turn, and sweat, and groan as the temperature refuses to drop and the drunks argue outside your window</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You toss, and turn, and sweat, and groan as the temperature refuses to drop and the drunks argue loudly outside your open bedroom windows. Somewhere in the room you hear the buzz of a mosquito, but you\u2019re too tired to get up and deal with it, so you cower beneath the sheet in the hope that the thin membrane of fabric will protect you from the inevitable bloodsucking. You\u2019ve tried everything: cold showers, sleeping under a wet towel, naked, buying a cheapo fan from Argos, cotton underpants, but still, the sleep refuses to come. Meanwhile, next to you lies a peaceful summer god or goddess snoring lightly. Amazingly, they are fragrant in their repose, and dry to the touch, and you hate them for it. What dark magic is this?</p> <h2><strong>Booze</strong></h2> <p>You are drunk. You cannot remember a time when you have not been drunk, so long have you been drinking. Everyone else is drinking too, of course, the heat demands it. \u201cRos\u00e9!\u201d someone shouted, around lunchtime, in the beer garden, and a bottle was bought. You drank it, warm, like juice, then moved on to prosecco; fluorescent cocktails with umbrellas in; a can or two of Foster\u2019s. You protected your Pimm\u2019s from a cloud of wasps by sprinting across a croquet lawn, then decided to have another gin and tonic, maybe a cheeky mojito. You feel slightly woozy and restless, you can\u2019t remember the last time you had a drink of water. You think the midges might have got the backs of your calves. You barely slept last night and there\u2019s a heat rash on your shoulders. Sweat pools in your bellybutton; you can feel your nose starting to peel. The hayfever is back. But it\u2019s OK, because you\u2019re pissed. You ignore that nagging feeling and pose for the photographs. When you look at them, later, you see a stranger looking back at you. She is smiling, but there is pain behind her eyes. Her skin is the colour of deli meat. Her hair looks atrocious. This is what summer\u2019s about.</p>",

The hope of being with him no longer exists.\u201d</p> <p>The life and death of Luis G\u00f3ngora occurred at the intersection of twin crises: homelessness and police killings. Amid a tech-fueled economic boom, the major cities of the US west coast have become as notable for their sprawling homeless encampments as they are for their billion-dollar companies.</p> <p>Seattle has Amazon, and the Jungle. Los Angeles boasts Snapchat, and Skid Row. Throughout San Francisco, tent cities compete for space on the sidewalks with the hordes of employees of firms such as Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, and Airbnb.</p> <p>The encampments can be magnets for crime \u2013 and police. </p> <p>No one tracks police brutality against the homeless, but a review of media reports reveals that at least thirteen of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">1,146 people killed by police</a> in 2015 were homeless.

His father, Demetrio, worked as an assistant for the local butcher, where he was paid in meat rather than cash. His mother, Estela, raised nine children in a one-room Mayan hut with a thatched palm roof and dirt floor. She rose at 5am each day to prepare the <em>k\u2019eyem</em> (corn flour mash, diluted in water) for the family to drink for breakfast.</p> <p>When the children were sick, there was no money for medicine, so Demetrio treated their ailments with traditional herbal medicines.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His father, Demetrio, worked as an assistant for the local butcher, where he was paid in meat rather than cash</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps because of this poverty, Luis G\u00f3ngora would eat anything. He shot <em>loros</em> \u2013 small green and yellow parrots with just a few ounces of meat on them, if that \u2013 out of trees with a slingshot, and prepared them like poultry. If he came across a deer, he would try to shoot it and lug it home. The fat black iguanas that skulked among the rocks were good for a meal as well.</p> <p>When Luis G\u00f3ngora was just 12 years old, he left school and went to work. His younger brother, Jos\u00e9, followed a few years later. The pair were the youngest of the G\u00f3ngora siblings, and wherever Luis went, Jos\u00e9 followed. They did not like school, never learned to read, and were both more comfortable speaking Mayan than Spanish.</p> <p>\u201cWe dedicated ourselves to the fields,\u201d Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora said.</p> <p>G\u00f3ngora met his future wife, Fidelia del Carmen, when they were 14.

The <em>ejido</em> \u2013 communal farm land \u2013<strong> </strong> provides food to eat, but for clothes, shoes, and medicine, cash is required. Many men travel to Canc\u00fan, M\u00e9rida, or Chetumal six days a week \u2013 or for an entire tourist season \u2013 to earn money to support their families. But those who can put together the fee for a coyote \u2013 a guide paid to smuggle migrants across the border \u2013 usually go to San Francisco.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>The migration corridor between Yucat\u00e1n and San Francisco was established one border crossing at a time. As word of mouth and family connections grew, it turned into something of a migration highway in the early 2000s. There are estimated to be 50,000 Yucatecan migrants in the San Francisco Bay Area, 90% of them undocumented, 80% of them Mayan-speaking, and 70% of them male.</p> <p>Thousands of Yucatecos work in the kitchens of San Francisco\u2019s thriving restaurant scene, and the wages earned there are visible in the landscape of Yucatecan towns, where construction workers and modern houses are a sure sign of a relative in San Francisco.</p> <p>A few blocks from the central square of Oxkutzcab, a neighboring town to Teabo, a two-story structure featuring the iconic bay windows of San Francisco\u2019s Victorian townhouses rises above a dusty intersection.

Their mother pawned her gold earrings to pay the fee for a <em>coyote</em>, and Jos\u00e9 arrived in San Francisco on September 11. The first thing he saw was news footage of the Twin Towers falling.</p> <p>Assisted by a network of cousins already established in San Francisco, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora soon found work as a dishwasher and began sending money home.</p> <p>As Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora\u2019s wife, Julia, began to build her house, Luis G\u00f3ngora, whose family still lived in a Mayan hut in the land behind his parent\u2019s house, itched to join his brother. He sold a horse and a summer\u2019s harvest and left for San Francisco in September 2002.</p> <p>The 31-year-old migrant could be forgiven for having high expectations. Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s cousin and childhood friend, Luis Armando Poot Pat, had been living in San Francisco for 12 years, and his experience hewed closely to the American dream. After arriving in the US, Poot had found work at a restaurant as a janitor.</p> <p>Twenty-six<strong> </strong>years later, Poot is the manager at the same restaurant. His wife and children were able to join him in San Francisco. One of his sons is studying biochemical engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p> <p>When Poot ran across Luis G\u00f3ngora at the main intersection of the Mission district, a historically Latino neighborhood where the Yucatecos often cross paths, he was able to quickly set his cousin up with a job as a prep cook at Mel\u2019s Diner, a 1950s throwback restaurant where the milkshakes are thick and the staff wear white paper caps and bow ties.</p> <p>After bouncing around different buildings in the Mission for a few years, Luis and Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora settled in an apartment at 1751 Market Street, where they roomed with another man from Teabo, who they called El Torero.</p> <p>A non-descript apartment building upstairs from a popular piano bar, 1751 Market became known as San Francisco\u2019s most \u201c<a href=\"http://sf.curbed.com/2015/4/16/9969980/inside-the-nightmarish-infested-building-at-the-center-of-the-soma\">nightmarish</a>\u201d, \u201c<a href=\"http://sfist.com/2015/04/17/this_may_be_san_franciscos_most_dis.php\">disgusting</a>\u201d apartment building when a group of tenants <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1875519-valencia-market-lawsuit.html\">sued</a> the landlords for $10m in 2014.

Most of the employees in the kitchen who spoke Mayan left, Poot explained, and without them to translate, G\u00f3ngora was unable to do his job and got fired.</p> <p>He found another job at another restaurant with Mayan speakers for about two years, but when they left, he was unemployed again.</p> <p>\u201cHe got really frustrated because he didn\u2019t have money to send to Mexico,\u201d Poot said. \u201cHe found other work, but he had issues. No other people speaking Mayan \u2013 he couldn\u2019t get a stable job. He was short of money.\u201d</p> <p>El Torero, the roommate, left San Francisco and returned to Teabo to pursue his dream of being a bullfighter. (He died, gored by a bull, in 2013). Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora found a job in the suburbs, doing landscaping work, and returned to the apartment infrequently.</p> <p>It was around this time, Castro said, that Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s  drinking and marijuana use transitioned into more serious drug abuse. Another Yucatecan in the building was dealing heroin, and Castro believes Luis G\u00f3ngora got hooked.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora says that he never saw his brother using hard drugs, but he was not around much to see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ebda6d2a3bf0adf94761e335539b1b294ee57e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ebda6d2a3bf0adf94761e335539b1b294ee57e/0_149_2333_2917/800.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Poot got his cousin Luis G\u00f3ngora his first job as a prep cook in San Francisco, but they later lost touch. \u2018I didn\u2019t know how to help him.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Poot got his cousin Luis G\u00f3ngora his first job as a prep cook in San Francisco, but they later lost touch. \u2018I didn\u2019t know how to help him.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is unclear exactly how the brothers came to be evicted from 1751 Market. Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora says that he was still leaving money for rent, but he doesn\u2019t know if the money made its way to the landlord. Poot says that, once El Torero left town, the G\u00f3ngora brothers struggled to \u201cmanage the household\u201d since neither could read or speak English.</p> <p>Either way, in the fall of 2013, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora returned to the Market Street building to find his apartment locked and his belongings in the trash. He salvaged a bag with some photographs and personal items and was out on the street.</p> <p>Homelessness was a harrowing experience for both of the brothers, and the crisis forced them in different directions. Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora stayed with friends for a few days, and then found a room in a residential hotel for a week.</p> <p>\u201cFirst I lost my home, and then I lost my job,\u201d he said. \u201cI had this bag of stuff. How was I going to arrive at work with this bag of stuff?\u201d</p> <p>The brothers lost track of each other.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was living on the street, I saw Sapo once,\u201d Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora said, using a family nickname for his brother. \u201cI said, \u2018Where are you living? On the street also?\u2019 I said, \u2018Each one of us is on our own path.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora later slept in public transit stations or on buses. One day he went to the police station, hoping to turn himself in and get deported to Mexico. The police told him to go away, unless he wanted to be locked up.</p> <p>After two weeks of sleeping in a park, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora convinced his cousin Poot to take him in. It wasn\u2019t easy. Jos\u00e9 was skinny and unclean, but more than anything, Poot said, he was traumatized.</p> <p>Poot took over, imposing strict rules and caring for Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora until he recovered. Poot found him a new job, stopped him from drinking, and took control of his finances, sending all of his wages back to his family.</p> <p>\u201cJos\u00e9 has always been well-behaved. When they were kids, Luis was like the boss, the dad. Jos\u00e9 was the one following orders,\u201d Poot explained.</p> <p>Since 8 November 2013 \u2013 the day Poot accepted him into his house \u2013 Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora has not had a single beer or sip of alcohol.</p> <p>\u201cNo beer, no marijuana, only work,\u201d Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora jokes.</p> <p>Poot tried to arrange a similar rescue for Luis G\u00f3ngora, who was still on the streets, but with little success.</p> <p>\u201cLuis always wanted to make his own decisions,\u201d Poot said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If Luis had come knocking on my door instead of Jos\u00e9, maybe I would have helped him instead, but fate put Jos\u00e9 in my path.\u201d</p> <p>Poot\u2019s brother, Wilberto, tried to take Luis G\u00f3ngora in, but he didn\u2019t follow the rules of the house \u2013 not going out at night and ringing the doorbell, staying out of sight of the landlord \u2013 and it didn\u2019t work. Poot paid for Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s documents to be sent to San Francisco so he could send his cousin back to Mexico, but Luis lost the papers. Another relative took Luis G\u00f3ngora to live in San Jose, but again Luis returned to the streets.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to help him,\u201d Poot said. \u201cHe had no house, no money, no job, no papers \u2013 so many issues.\u201d</p> <p>The longer he was homeless, the worse Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s mental state seemed to get.</p> <p>\u201cHe would be confused when he was talking to you. Sometimes he would be fine, and sometimes he would just be talking to himself on the street,\u201d Poot said.</p> <p>For a while, Luis slept on the sidewalk in front of the building where his brother and cousin lived in an apartment with Poot\u2019s wife and children.</p> <p>\u201cI was very sad, because I told him at some point, don\u2019t come knocking on the door because if the owner sees you, he might be given a reason to throw us out,\u201d Poot recalled.</p> <p>Despite his downward spiral in San Francisco, Luis G\u00f3ngora kept up appearances with his family in Teabo. He never told them that he was homeless. He didn\u2019t talk about himself.</p> <p>\u201cThe saddest part is that the family is learning now how he was living. Luis\u2019s mom asked me, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u2019\u201d Poot said. \u201cI never told them because I thought it would cause them sadness.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cf1d4329fa4bb829409273e1f77caeabf1464dc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1d4329fa4bb829409273e1f77caeabf1464dc2/0_35_4232_2539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s widow stands with their daughter, two sons and grandchildren at their home in Teabo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s widow stands with their daughter, two sons and grandchildren at their home in Teabo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Gabaldon/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora was at the laundromat on 7 April when he heard police sirens.

He told his manager that he needed to leave early, that he needed to go look for his brother.</p> <p>When he arrived at the homeless encampment where Luis G\u00f3ngora had been living for the past few months, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora asked for his brother\u2019s whereabouts by miming kicking a soccer ball. A homeless outreach worker from a neighborhood non-profit grabbed his arm and said, \u201cGet your strength.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important for us Mayans, once a person is dead, to honor them,\u201d Poot said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re alive, you can defend yourself, but once you\u2019re dead, you have to honor them.

The story of his killing can only be composed by the testimony of the police who killed him and the witnesses who saw it happen.</p> <p>The fatal encounter was set in motion when two homeless outreach workers went to the homeless encampment where Luis G\u00f3ngora lived, responding to a report that a baby was crying. The workers did not find a baby, but police say the outreach workers saw G\u00f3ngora \u201cswinging [a knife] indiscriminately as he walked down the street\u201d, prompting them to call the police.</p> <p>Former San Francisco police chief Greg Suhr told members of the public that G\u00f3ngora was \u201cseated on the sidewalk with a large knife and the blade pointed up\u201d when police officers arrived on the scene.

  "<p>Ryanair, Flybe and Monarch are overcharging customers who pay by credit card, according to claims made by consumer group Fairer Finance.</p> <p>As millions of travellers jet off for summer holidays and city breaks, some airlines charge customers fees of up to 3% of ticket prices. </p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.fairerfinance.com/campaigns/red-card-for-card-charges\">Fairer Finance said</a> a rule change in 2013 stated companies should not charge more than it costs them to process a credit card transaction.</p> <p>All three airlines denied they were infringing any rules and said they set fees to cover costs. <br></p> <p>A European ruling last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/27/cap-on-card-fees-retailers\">put a cap on the cost</a> of using credit cards by limiting interchange fees charged by credit card companies to merchants to 0.3%. Additional costs should be no more than another 0.3% for big companies, suggesting a fair fee is 0.6% and that anything more than 1% is excessive, Fairer Finance claimed.</p> <p>Ryanair charges customers 2% of the ticket price for using a credit card while Flybe and Monarch charge 3% to cover the costs of processing a credit card transaction. </p> <p>Ryanair said Fairer Finance\u2019s claims were false and that the airline complies with all EU rules. Flybe said its charges meet UK requirements and that it scrapped debit card fees for online payments in 2012. Monarch said fees reflected its costs and that credit card customers paying via PayPal incurred no fee.</p> <p>Some insurers and local authorities also charge 2% or more for using a credit card, Fairer Finance said.<br></p> <p>The group called on the government to put pressure on companies and other organisations over credit card fees. Trading standards officers should investigate and fine offenders and ministers should make it clear that the law will be enforced, it said.</p> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/credit-and-debit-card-fees-to-be-capped\">cap on interchange fees</a> was announced, the UK government said it expected retailers and other merchants to pass on the savings to consumers by cutting prices.</p> <p>James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance, said: \u201cTaking people\u2019s money is a basic part of doing business. In our view, companies should not be charging consumers anything for that. However, if they choose to charge for accepting credit card payments then the rules make it very clear that they can only pass on the cost. We believe there are hundreds of companies in breach of the regulations but no one is policing this issue.\u201d<br></p> <p>Daley said companies\u2019 behaviour was made more stark by the actions of certain competitors. EasyJet cut its credit card fee to 1% from 2% this year while United Airlines, Air Canada and the travel company Trailfinders charge nothing.</p> <p>Daley added that credit card fees harm competition by attracting customers with prices that often go up at the final stage of their purchase.</p>",

  "<p>It is reported that when the 6th Duke of Westminster, who died this week, realised at the age of 15 that he was heir to his family\u2019s immense fortune, he dreaded it \u2013 the responsibility, the knowledge that he hadn\u2019t earned it, the isolation it would bring him. He would have prepared his son for the eventuality of becoming duke, although neither would have wanted to think it would happen as early as it did. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/the-duke-of-westminster-obituary\">Gerald Grosvenor died suddenly at the age of 64</a>; his son Hugh, now the 7th Duke of Westminster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/new-duke-of-westminster-hugh-grosvenor-inherit-fortune\">is just 25 and inherits the family\u2019s \u00a39.3bn fortune</a>.</p> <p>Aside from the trauma of losing a parent \u2013 having money does not ease the pain of bereavement \u2013 the 25-year-old finds himself in both an enviable, and unenviable, position. On the one hand, he becomes one of the richest men in the world; on the other, money didn\u2019t bring happiness to his father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/the-duke-of-westminster-obituary\">who appeared to find his title and wealth a burden</a>. \u201cGiven the choice I would rather not have been born wealthy, but I never think of giving it up,\u201d he said once. \u201cI can\u2019t sell it. It doesn\u2019t belong to me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/the-duke-of-westminster-obituary\">The Duke of Westminster obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is, however, very difficult to feel sorry for the rich, which is, in itself, a problem for many of them. \u201cThey know that others have no sympathy for them, and no understanding of the situation they\u2019re in,\u201d says Thayer Willis, author of Navigating the Dark Side of Wealth: A Life Guide for Inheritors, who runs a <a href=\"http://www.thayerwillis.com/\">counselling business helping the rich deal with the psychological challenges of wealth</a>. \u201cThey know not to go around whining and expecting people to feel sorry for them.\u201d</p> <p>But there are serious challenges that come from inheriting vast fortunes, she says, particularly at a young age. Willis knows many of them herself \u2013 she was born into the family that started the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, a timber company worth billions. \u201cI stumbled through my 20s and made a lot of mistakes,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cFor all of us, our 20s and 30s are the \u2018building years\u2019, when we\u2019re meant to get out in the world, figure out who we are, what we like to do, who we like, who we like to date,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving a tremendous amount of financial wealth come into your life at that point really messes with motivation. All of a sudden the question becomes: \u2018What do I need to do to manage this wealth?\u2019 instead of: \u2018How do I identify and clarify who I really am?\u2019 People\u2019s motivation to be around you becomes questionable. Are they attracted to me or to this wealth?\u201d These are \u201cdefinitely first-world problems, but it certainly messes with the psychological development of that young adult\u201d. In her 30s, Willis settled down, trained as a psychotherapist and became a wealth counsellor.</p> <p>If it\u2019s so awful \u2013 an obvious question \u2013 why not give the money away? \u201cSome people think of that, usually to the horror of the family. Older family members understand what this money can do in terms of providing a resource for any kind of emergency, or starting a business, or philanthropy.\u201d</p> <p>For inheritors of wealth going back generations, there is a sense, as Grosvenor said, that they are mere custodians and the money isn\u2019t theirs to give away or lose. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some quite young heirs who really understand the dynastic vision of a family from a pretty early age,\u201d says Julian Washington, head of intermediary relationship management at RBC Wealth Management. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be the weak link in the chain when the family story is told. In my experience, when you deal with old-money families, if you want to call them that, they tend to be pretty good at educating their next generation, because typically they\u2019ve been doing it for centuries.\u201d And when someone \u2013 a male member of the family, thanks to outrageous primogeniture \u2013 comes to inherit, \u201cmore often than not they\u2019re in a pretty good place because they come to it with all that tradition and they understand the nature of the shoes they\u2019re stepping into\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3338c2fbd0a23362e1eeb9a272df7947a94ddc94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3338c2fbd0a23362e1eeb9a272df7947a94ddc94/0_54_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan Zuckerberg have decided to give away 99% of their fortune \u2013 but their daughter, Max, could still inherit $450m.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan Zuckerberg have decided to give away 99% of their fortune \u2013 but their daughter, Max, could still inherit $450m.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plenty of members of the super-rich have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/07/new-philanthropists-wealthy-people\">decided not to burden their children with vast, unearned fortunes in the first place</a> \u2013 it is enough that they have had expensive educations and all the opportunities of a privileged start in life. Warren Buffett\u2019s famous take on inheritance is to leave his children \u201cenough money so that they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing\u201d. It has been reported, though not confirmed, that Bill Gates plans to leave his children a meagre $10m (\u00a37.7m) each from his $76bn fortune. Mark and Priscilla Zuckerberg have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/01/mark-zuckerberg-and-priscilla-chan-announce-new-baby-and-massive-charity-initiative\">pledged to give away 99% of their $45bn pile</a> (although it\u2019s all relative \u2013 this still leaves them, and their daughter, with $450m). Not quite on the same financial scale, Nigella Lawson has said she isn\u2019t planning to leave her children anything: \u201cIt ruins people not having to earn money.\u201d</p> <p>Sam Roddick, the daughter of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/12/guardianobituaries.business\">Body Shop founder Anita Roddick</a>, didn\u2019t know that her mother, who died in 2007, had planned to give away her entire \u00a351m fortune. \u201cWe found out when it was published in a Daily Mail article,\u201d she laughs. It wasn\u2019t entirely a surprise \u2013 her parents were socialists, rather than socialites, and their business was famous for its fair-trade principles. And it wasn\u2019t personal. Cutting one\u2019s child out of your will can, to some, seem like \u201ca deep act of abandonment. I never had that abandonment because I had a healthy relationship with her. I know other people who haven\u2019t been given money and it has been a huge act of aggression.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/duke-westminster-hugh-grosvenor-inheritance-tax-reform\">Duke's \u00a39bn inheritance prompts call for tax overhaul</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roddick was also unusual among the children of the rich in that she hadn\u2019t grown up surrounded by wealth. She was largely brought up by her working-class grandmother, \u201cand working-class values \u2013 you work hard, you earn your keep and you contribute to society. Entitled people from inherited wealth are all about other people being in service to them.\u201d</p> <p>She has observed the very wealthy people she has met over the years. \u201cThey are isolated from normal society,\u201d she says. With the extremely wealthy, \u201crelationships become transactional, and that is something that is extraordinarily emotionally damaging. A lot of very wealthy people are not accountable to their community, they\u2019re not accountable to the people they love, they show their power and control through transaction and they are unhappy, from what I can tell. The people I know who are very wealthy and are happy are all contributing something to society.\u201d Until we sort out the rules that allow vast fortunes held in trusts, as the Grosvenor estate is, to avoid hefty death duties and be passed down the generations, it\u2019s something for the new Duke of Westminster and his future male heirs to bear in mind.</p>",

And on Friday morning, in a bad-tempered encounter on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the cricketer and the naturalist took potshots at each other as Nick Robinson listened in. \u201cIt\u2019s only people like Chris that want to sabotage nature,\u201d said Botham. \u201cBeefy\u2019s batting on a sticky wicket,\u201d Packham replied.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/aug/12/chris-packham-and-ian-botham-clash-over-grouse-shooting-ban-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qh6c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2650089\"            data-video-name=\"Chris Packham and Ian Botham clash over grouse-shooting ban \u2013 audio\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC Radio 4 / Today\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ada821e4b05ef4244a4e32\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/12/160812Grouse_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/12/160812Grouse.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/12/160812Grouse_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/aug/12/chris-packham-and-ian-botham-clash-over-grouse-shooting-ban-audio\">Chris Packham and Ian Botham clash over grouse-shooting ban \u2013 audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Why such antipathy between the two tribes \u2013 and why is Packham such a target? The answer begins with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/25/rspb-calls-for-grouse-shooting-estates-to-be-licensed\">RSPB\u2019s longstanding defence of raptors such as hen harriers</a>, which feed on grouse but are still being illegally persecuted and killed by some grouse moor owners. Meanwhile, there is evidence that driven grouse shooting \u2013 where wild birds are sent towards the guns by \u201cbeaters\u201d \u2013 damages protected wildlife sites, and increases flood risk and greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>Adding to the shooters\u2019 pain is a<a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/125003\"> parliamentary e-petition</a> that has more than 89,000 signatures calling for an end to the sport.

He sends the Guardian Botham\u2019s response to two questions: \u201cThere are activists in and outside the RSPB with a clear agenda of getting grouse shooting banned \u2013 I am passionate about putting the other side of the debate which is that such a ban would not just lead to heavy job losses but the destruction of breeding grounds which are essential to birds like lapwing and curlew.\u201d</p> <p>Gregory is contemptuous of the RSPB. \u201cI am a townie.

He is extremely biased and explosive in his language,\u201d says Gregory.<br></p> <p>Packham is measured in response: \u201cMy hypothesis, and that\u2019s all it is, is that You Forgot the Birds is a concerted attempt by shooting interests to manipulate government policy processes to try and get their demands met on grouse shooting by neutralising the RSPB and people like myself who side with them.

If he would have done things properly, you wouldn\u2019t have had Isis. Therefore, he was the founder of Isis.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Obama nor Clinton could in any rational sense be said to have \u201cfounded\u201d Isis: the president has ordered hundreds of soldiers into harm\u2019s way to combat the group, and spent two years and millions of dollars killing its militants in Syria, Iraq and Libya. There is a feasible argument that Obama created a power vacuum by withdrawing US forces from Iraq, but this ignores that his administration <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html\">failed to come to a troops agreement with Baghdad\u2019s leadership </a>at the time \u2013 meaning the withdrawal was not a unilateral decision. Similarly, Obama followed the<a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html\"> timeline set by George W Bush</a> to \u201cwithdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011\u201d.</p> <p>The argument that regional destabilization created Isis could be extended to Bush-era decisions; his administration purged Ba\u2019athist officials from the government and military, some of whom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\">became Isis\u2019s leadership</a>, and the civil war fought while he was in office saw the rise of al-Qaida in Iraq, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/world/middleeast/in-rise-of-isis-no-single-missed-key-but-many-strands-of-blame.html\">segments of which grew into Isis</a>.

But Trump often ignores the basics of English grammar and speaks in tangled tenses, mountains of interrupting clauses, and without sensible syntax or even subject-verb agreements, all of which can render his speech <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/763471550850830336\">opaque at best.</a></p> <p>In the speech itself Trump leapt from talking about \u201clower electric bills\u201d and energy policy to the supreme court and gun rights.

In a video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvOZAuPVSh0\">uploaded two days later</a>, he said he had come voluntarily to study. Before long he was reunited with his son in Tehran, and then he disappeared.</p> <p>At the time, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/world/middleeast/14iran.html\">Clinton said</a>: \u201cHe\u2019s free to go. He was free to come. Those decisions are his alone to make.\u201d</p> <p>Intelligence officials later told the New York Times that he was a voluntary defector and that the videos were made under pressure from Iranian and American authorities, respectively. Weeks after his voluntary return to Tehran, on 15 July 2010, he disappeared.</p> <p>Also on that day, the New York Times reported, citing US officials,<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/world/middleeast/16iran.html?_r=1\"> that Amiri had given them \u201csignificant, original\u201d information</a> \u201cabout secret aspects of his country\u2019s nuclear program\u201d. American officials had promised \u201ca new identity and benefits amounting to about $5m\u201d in return, according to the paper.</p> <p>In a state department email released years later, Clinton aides warned that Amiri, called \u201cour friend\u201d, wanted to leave. \u201cIf he has to leave, so be it,\u201d a former state department special envoy wrote in a 5 July 2010 email.</p> <p>In other words, Amiri\u2019s assistance to the US had been reported publicly for six years before his execution, years before the release of any emails from state department servers. The FBI has said there is no evidence that Clinton\u2019s private email servers were hacked, though director James Comey has said they were susceptible to attack. The Democratic National Committee and Clinton\u2019s campaign were targeted in a hack that has been largely blamed on Russian security services, and that took place years after Amiri\u2019s disappearance in Iran. </p> <p></p> <p></p>",

The show\u2019s success seems to have triggered a latent hunger for unadulterated synth music.</p> <p>When internet <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/localactionrecords/stranger-things-special-on-radar-radio\">dance show Local Action</a> put out a call for Stranger Things-inspired tunes for their slot on Radar Radio, they were inundated with submissions from artists such as <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/sharpveins\">Sharp Veins</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/strictface\">Strict Face</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mumdance\">Mumdance</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DJMURLO\">Murlo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhNjbfaRiRE\">Xela</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/slackk\">Slackk</a> and <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/facta\">Facta</a>.

We wanted the Stephen King DNA, the John Carpenter DNA. We thought, let\u2019s get more into electronic music.\u201d</p> <p>This means a long-awaited moment in the (artificial, fluorescent) sun for synthwave or retrowave, the revivalist sound that\u2019s been booming since the mid-noughties and which received a boost when Drive put A Real Hero by College and Electric Youth onto everyone\u2019s playlists in 2011. Now diverse acts such as Lazerhawk, mitch murder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/jan/31/com-truise-colorvision-wip\">Com Truise</a>, Chrome Canyon, Le Matos and \u2013 I\u2019m not making this up \u2013 <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/80s-stallone\">80s Stallone</a> are delivering high-grade, moody analogue robo-pop for anyone who wants to pretend that their evening commuter crawl down the M62 is an existential circuit round the bleeding neon periphery of LA.</p> <p>The analogue sounds are raw; the iconography is Blade Runner; the artwork is lurid, metallic, airbrushed and inspired by 80s movie posters and video game boxes \u2026 and to be fair it\u2019s probably a bit rich, and certainly too ironic for most tastes.</p> <p>Sometimes you suspect that some of these people have only ever seen one movie, and that\u2019s Tron. But for all that, the tunes are full of invention and brooding atmosphere, testimony to the versatility of all those old machines. If nothing else, it proves that the Pet Shop Boys chose exactly the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5L7Ph5PhFtwfE4lVtiPjDJ\">right time to go retro-electro</a>.<br></p> <p>Perhaps new converts would like to consult the motherlode of synth-based terror music too.

Whatever you do, don\u2019t ride home on a Chopper bike.

There was little they could do for him, and now Lounceny cannot walk. His family has to carry him to the mines, where he sits on a mat all day as they search.</p> <p>On Thursday, Africa was set to celebrate two years with no new cases of wild polio, a major step on the way to consigning cases like Lounceny\u2019s to the past.

The <a href=\"http://www.polioeradication.org/\">Global Polio Eradication Initiative</a>, set up in 1988 by Rotary International, the World Health Organisation (WHO), Unicef and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has now almost managed to eradicate the disease.</p> <p>When Nigeria marked two years without any new cases last month, Afghanistan and Pakistan were thought to be the last countries in the world left where polio is endemic.

Let all the athletes take whatever drugs they like and let them get on with it?</p> <p>It\u2019s not as unusual a suggestion as you might think. I\u2019ve heard it numerous times, usually in pubs after a few drinks. It was put forward as a question at a recent recording I did of the <a href=\"http://leveluphuman.com/\">Level Up Human</a> podcast. Marina Hyde acknowledged it in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/lilly-king-olympian-rio-2016\">her recent post for the Guardian</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3c039d19c92c3ab571995b5c863e72aff8400c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3c039d19c92c3ab571995b5c863e72aff8400c9/0_319_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this Monday, July 18, 2016, An Indonesian health official prepares a vaccine injection during a revaccination program for children who were earlier given fake vaccines, at a community health center in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Dropping the constant tests and checks would save much time and money. It wouldn\u2019t be \u201cunfair\u201d, as every athlete has access to the same drugs, so it levels the playing field. It could even make it more inclusive: people normally get to be top athletes because of \u201cunfair\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130925112343.htm\">genetic</a> <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2012/08/12/the-dna-olympics-jamaicans-win-sprinting-genetic-lottery-and-why-we-should-all-care/#255ba2b52263\">advantages</a>, so those who normally couldn\u2019t keep up can use drugs to compensate and stay competitive. And, potentially, it could make the games far more interesting. World records constantly being smashed, athletes being faster, stronger, more enduring. What\u2019s not to like? So yes, why not just allow doping in the Olympics? </p> <p>Sadly, this is not a rhetorical question. It turns out that, rather than being limited to slightly-inebriated discussions among friends, the notion of an Olympics where doping is permitted has actually being <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21244107\">scientifically studied</a>. And it should perhaps come as no surprise to find that, according to all available data, legalised doping in the Olympics would be an absolutely terrible idea. </p> <p>Firstly, the idea that allowing doping would make things fairer is ludicrous. People seem to forget it\u2019s performance <em>enhancing</em> drugs, not performance <em>creating. </em>Basically, if you\u2019re a 20 stone trucker with a dodgy hip, a course of steroids and hormones is not going to turn you into a world-class athlete. <a href=\"http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/athletic-drug-test.htm\">Performance enhancing drugs work in a number of ways</a>, but performing miracles isn\u2019t one of them. You <em>still need to be a top athlete </em>for them to have any useful effect, so any notion that doping would allow \u201cnormal\u201d people to compete should be abandoned.</p> <p>It would still be something of a genetic lottery as well. How people respond to drugs is <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v1/n1/full/nrd705.html\">heavily influenced by their own personal physiology and genes</a>, and this is equally true for performance enhancers. If anything, a doped Olympics would be more exclusive, not less, as it would favour those individuals lucky enough to be born with bodies that are physically better at sport whilst also more responsive to the positive effects of doping and resistant to the negative consequences. No doubt such people are relatively rare, even among the already-small pool of world-class athletes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8bb6b3eb8010f58706493a333668120cc25ff41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8bb6b3eb8010f58706493a333668120cc25ff41/0_129_2428_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this July 3, 2016, file photo, English Gardner, winner, from left, second place, Tianna Bartoletta, and third place, Tori Bowie finish the women\u2019s 100-meter final at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials in Eugene, Ore.

Top athletes <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538475/\">put their bodies through punishing regimes with long-term consequences as it is</a>. Making doping compulsory would only drastically increase the <a href=\"http://www.usada.org/substances/effects-of-performance-enhancing-drugs/\">risk of serious damage to the health of an athlete</a>. And it would be compulsory; the odds of someone at that level relying on the \u201cnatural\u201d approach when all their competitors are doped up to the extremes are laughably small.</p> <p>A regime of doping to get the best possible result would require a team of dedicated medics monitoring athletes and their reactions, plus a regular supply of the latest and most effective performance-enhancing substances, so there goes any notion of efficiency and cutting costs. </p> <p>Again, this would make the playing field more uneven, not less. Countries like the US and China would have the resources and infrastructure to obtain the best performance enhancers for their athletes and maximise their safety when using them. What chance would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/helplessness-rio-hope-olympic-refugee-team\">the Refugee Olympic Team</a> have in this scenario? </p> <p>We\u2019d likely end up with more regulation as well, as organisations have to determine which drugs are allowed where and when to ensure fairness in the contest.

Then we would be where we are now but faster/higher/stronger by 5-10%, depending on event and drugs used.\u201d</p> <p>So there we have it. The Doping Olympics: no fairer or cheaper or any more entertaining, much more dangerous, and serving only to undermine the achievement of every athlete involved and remove any inspirational element from the tournament.</p> <p>It seems the only real use for a Doping Olympics would be to say it\u2019s going ahead, then immediately ban any athlete who shows up to compete.

  "<p>Krys Lee\u2019s debut novel, <em>How I Became a North Korean</em>, opens with a description of a lavish banquet hosted in Pyongyang by the dictatorial \u201cDear Leader\u201d. The guests wear fur coats and Rolex watches, and sit at a mahogany table, eating delicacies flown in from the Tokyo Tsukiji fish market by private jet. Following the meal, the host raises his hand: \u201ca glittering disco globe came down from the ceiling and the Joy Brigade began strutting in pink hot pants to a banned American pop song\u201d. One couple, a senior party official and his wife, whose story we are following, are among those obliged to dance. Suddenly the mood changes, and the evening ends with the official shot dead, and his wife and son, Yongju, forced to flee the totalitarian state across the heavily patrolled border into China.</p> <p>Yongju\u2019s tale of escape is told alongside those of two other fugitives in the border area: Jangmi, a young North Korean woman who has become pregnant after a relationship with a married man; and Danny, a Korean-American. Betrayal, cruelty and violence lie ahead of them, as well as the possibility of salvation, in different forms. All three face desperate hunger; Jangmi trades sex for survival. When we meet, Lee says that halfway through writing her characters\u2019 interlinked narratives, she wasn\u2019t sure herself whether they were going to make it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/north-korean-defectors-america-reality\">North Korean defectors see American dream deferred as reality sets in the US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lee, whose book of short stories, <em>Drifting House</em>, deservedly won much praise when it was published in 2012, has been active for more than a decade helping defectors from North Korea, and draws on this work in her novel. She writes in English, having been educated in the US and the UK, but was born in Seoul, South Korea, and has lived there for some time. \u201cI am always going to be on the side of people who have survived,\u201d she says, \u201cand who have experienced things that most of us are lucky not to have faced.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a> is the site of one of the world\u2019s refugee crises, and Lee\u2019s novel is, among other things, a timely exploration of the fate of individuals who take desperate and perilous journeys away from persecution or extreme hardship. Over the years, she has listened to many nail-biting accounts of flight: the usual escape route for North Koreans is across the Tumen River, but because the DPRK is an ally of China, the Chinese authorities hunt down defectors and often send them back \u2013 where they face torture, detention, even execution. They are thus forced to remain in hiding, while brokers and agencies \u2013 with luck \u2013 organise their onward journey.</p> <p>Lee is keen to convey that behind the Orwellian grotesqueries of the North Korean dictatorship there are \u201cordinary\u201d people, with family and community ties, aspirations and memories. (The title of the novel hints at the political identities imposed on us all.) She is scathing about China\u2019s human rights record on refugees from the DPRK and tells of South Korean activists being tortured by electrocution and even dying in Chinese jails. In contrast, she has always been protected by her US passport. \u201cThe meaning of citizenship has troubled me for a very long time, why certain people have rights and privileges and others don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Lee is in no way a polemical writer, but the knowledge that informs <em>How I Became a North Korean</em> is hard-won. \u201cThe starting point for the novel was when North Koreans became part of my world,\u201d she says. \u201cI did whatever I could, and then I got threats, which changed everything.\u201d</p> <p>The threats came from an unlikely source \u2013 a Christian missionary, someone ostensibly involved in a good cause, setting up hideouts for defectors. Lee and the missionary were working together to help a refugee, but when, on a rare occasion, the man \u201cwas left alone with me, he got on his knees and begged me to get him out of the country,\u201d Lee recalls. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re different from the others.\u2019\u201d It turned out that the missionary wanted to keep him locked up in China, and \u2013 claiming a conversion \u2013 to use him to solicit donations.</p> <p>Lee had always assumed that \u201chuman rights and Christianity were on the same side in the border area, but it\u2019s often not the case\u201d. After she had acted alone in organising a way out for the refugee, the missionary began to call her. \u201cHe was furious, screaming at me, saying I wasn\u2019t going to get away with it. He was intent on revenge: I had stepped on his toes, his territory.\u201d Soon she began to receive calls from gangsters within South Korea, who knew where she lived. She was terrified, decamped to the US for months, and on returning to Seoul, moved house.</p> <p>She still sees the refugee regularly, and has now taken her own form of revenge. A central figure in <em>How I Became a North Korean</em> is Missionary Kwon, who appears to rescue the three fugitives, and installs them in a safe house. But they are effectively imprisoned, never see daylight, and are forced to memorise passages from the Bible. Kwon won\u2019t let them continue their journey until he believes their souls have been saved; his sadistic, exploitative nature is gradually revealed.</p> <p>Writers always return to their obsessions, Lee has said, and she counts religion \u2013 along with violence, power and inequality \u2013 among hers. In one of the stories in <em>Drifting House</em>, \u201cA Pastor\u2019s Son\u201d, the narrator\u2019s charismatic religious father abuses his new wife, pushing her head into a river. Another of the stories, \u201cThe Believer\u201d, which features murder, insanity and incest, begins: \u201cFor Jenny, G was always for God. God was there, God was everywhere.\u201d \u201cReligion has always been both something that\u2019s really close to me, and troubling to me,\u201d Lee has said; her father, I discover in talking to her, was both a violent man and a charismatic Christian pastor.</p> <p>\u201cI write fiction to get away from myself, only to learn that this is impossible,\u201d she has admitted. Lee completed first drafts of <em>Drifting House</em> fully believing she \u201cwasn\u2019t writing anything related to myself at all\u201d. As a PK (preacher\u2019s kid), she was \u201calways supposed to be good, and never to reveal anything \u2013 everything in my life was a secret\u201d. Only in revising them did she realise that \u201cthe stories are the most honest version of me\u201d. When we talk at her sister\u2019s house in a small city in California, two nervy dogs, one named Havoc, the other Mayhem, have been put outside, and spend much of the time desperate to get back in.</p> <p>The collection is eloquent on such subjects as the tearing apart of Korea by the cold war; the wrenching dislocation felt by emigrants; and the traditional, patriarchal Korean family. \u201cMy father was a God to me,\u201d she remembers. He \u201cwould say to me all the time: \u2018You are my property.\u2019\u201d Lee realises now that writing the stories was \u201cpartly an exercise in trying to understand\u201d her parents\u2019 generation: \u201cWhy were they the way they were? Why were so many people \u2013 us and those around us \u2013 so incredibly damaged?\u201d In \u201cThe Pastor\u2019s Son\u201d, the narrator begins to understand \u201cthe violence that my father had grown up with and passed down to us\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Living in a house where things were violent, you never knew what was going to happen, you were always afraid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lee was four when her family moved from Korea to San Jose, California. At least she thinks so: \u201cMy parents\u2019 version of events is rather slippery.\u201d Her father had deserted from the harsh Korean Naval Academy, and claimed he had to leave the country because of his pro-democracy activities. He later said his phone had been tapped \u2013 which was common in the context of late 1970s and early 80s South Korea. Lee doesn\u2019t know whether that was genuinely the case, \u201cbut I believe his paranoia was real\u201d.</p> <p>Her father had a strong Christian faith: in South Korea the church has long been connected to progressive views and social aspiration. Under its auspices, he emigrated to the US to study religion, later spending all the money the family had to bring out his wife and two daughters to join him. They all shared one bedroom in a basement in a pastor\u2019s house, and spent the next decade moving every few years, always short of cash. They went to the US \u201cin search of a better life, but ended up failing rather spectacularly. I\u2019ve always been haunted by the spectre of that failure and its repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>Lee grew up \u201cintimate with violence\u201d and remembers those years vividly; the easier times since \u201cseem a little like a dream\u201d. Her father was \u201ca deeply troubled man, who hurt everybody around him\u201d. \u201cThe problem with living in a house where things were violent and unstable,\u201d she says, her fluency for a moment checked by emotion, \u201cis that you never knew what was going to happen, you were always afraid; always tense.\u201d Books were one vital way out. \u201cBoth my sister and I had a desire not to be us. Books meant becoming other people. Like the wardrobe to Narnia or the rabbit-hole to Wonderland, they provided a gateway to another life.\u201d</p> <p>She was also a good student; schoolwork was \u201cone thing I could control\u201d. Lee got a scholarship to UCLA; her mother, who had been ill with cancer for a long time, with no health insurance, died during Lee\u2019s student years. She felt an inappropriate but overwhelming sense of guilt (\u201cwhen you grow up Christian, in a traditional Korean family, guilt is your third sibling\u201d) and, as soon as she could, got away, leaving for the UK on an exchange student programme, \u201cto escape my own history, and to allow me to discover who I was, without all the sadness and starkness\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/09/drifting-house-krys-lee-review\">Drifting House by Krys Lee - review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She studied and wrote poetry at the University of York and became engaged to be married: \u201cI was too young, but I was desperate to find a man who was a decent human being. The most recent decades of my life have been in part about learning that not all men are terrible or dangerous.\u201d The engagement was broken off when she went to Korea for a short-term trip: \u201cIt felt right; I started to understand my family and myself better; I needed to stay.\u201d She studied Korean, worked as an editor, and found enough stillness to be able \u201cto fully imagine another world \u2026 Stories began to come to me that I felt compelled to write.\u201d Following a scholarship to an MFA programme in the US and a couple of writing workshops in California, she found that publishers were bidding in an auction to buy her first book.</p> <p>The glowing reception given to <em>Drifting House</em> emphasised Lee\u2019s precise style, cool tone and her stories\u2019 \u201csmall moments of beauty and connection\u201d (her publishers compare her writing to that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/31/jhumpa-lahiri-in-other-words-italian-language\">Jhumpa Lahiri </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/18/chang-rae-lee-interview\">Chang rae-Lee</a>). She is a fierce editor of her own work, stripping pages away, and revised her novel for four years. <em>How I Became a North Korean</em>, though it recounts harrowing journeys, is, she says, \u201ca more hopeful book\u201d than her collection of stories: \u201cWhen I look back and see my own patterns, I realise that I was in a much darker place when I wrote <em>Drifting House</em>.\u201d The novel is suspenseful, beautifully written and in its deft realisation of character, offers a reminder that each refugee in the totality of a \u201ccrisis\u201d has a unique set of circumstances \u2013 as well as a personal response to displacement and, so often, the bitter loss of family.</p> <p>Lee now teaches creative writing at Yonsei University in Seoul, and as a professor is treated with far more respect by an older generation of Korean men than she is as a woman writer. She has decided, for the moment, not to have children with her partner, but regards it as a \u201clifelong goal\u201d to help teenagers who have come from violent homes; she wants to be \u201csomebody they can turn to\u201d.</p> <p>Still not fully part of Korean culture, Lee is now \u201cat home with not being at home\u201d. She is also at work on her second novel, which depicts a group of people who live underground, believing the world to have ended. The idea came to her in a dream about a couple making love on their knees in a confined space, with dirt falling in their eyes.</p> <p>Having moved from poetry to short stories to the novel, Lee is getting used to the \u201cgenerosity\u201d of the novel form; the next book will have \u201can explosion of voices\u201d, she says. Perhaps before too long she will again be praying \u2013 as she did when writing <em>How I Became a North Korean</em> \u2013 that her characters, like her, will survive.</p> <ul> <li><em>How I Became a North Korean, </em>published by Faber, is available from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/how-i-became-a-north-korean.html\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> at \u00a310.65.<br></li> </ul>",

Her set of pipes get four glaciers out of five, giving soaring gravitas to a dollop of fairly agreeable synthpop that could otherwise easily be overlooked, while her Norwegian lilt lends the song a quite lovely, otherworldly quality. I Went Too Far\u2019s only downside is that I haven\u2019t felt anything in six years, so I can\u2019t truly relate to something with this level of earnest emotion, let alone the kind that reduces someone to sadface acting to camera in a music video.

  "<p>I\u2019ve never been a great fan of Eric Pickles, briefly an underwhelming, budget-cutting leader of Bradford city council, later an underwhelming local government secretary whose chief contribution to \u201clocalism\u201d was to localise the budget cuts and still tell town halls what to do. I just didn\u2019t trust him.</p> <p>But he has a point in saying the government at every level <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/12/report-stringent-id-checks-cordons-electoral-fraud-pickles\">should take more seriously</a> the sensitive issue of voter fraud, not least by requiring identity checks at polling stations.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t sound very British, though ID cards or driver\u2019s licences are routine in some countries. But times change in such a mobile and diverse society as ours. Individual voting registration is new too, but it\u2019s a sensible response to this sort of problem. When \u201cstolen election\u201d claims are so casually bandied about by populist demagogues like Donald Trump or Nigel Farage (but you won the referendum, Nigel), we must protect their integrity.</p> <p>Pickles, a northern fish out of water in the Cameroon cabinet, was tasked by the then PM (and kept on by Theresa May) with looking into electoral corruption after a running battle in Tower Hamlets, east London, led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/jun/10/tower-hamlets-the-rise-and-fall-lutfur-rahman\">removal of mayor Lutfur Rahman</a> and a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) investigation. PwC found evidence of malpractice and cronyism, intimidation but not fraud. Rahman lost a high court case and was disqualified for five years.</p> <p>Messy stuff and not exclusive to east London, let alone to religious or ethnic minorities where, in some places, the paternalistic and authoritarian habits of rural villages have been imported. Northern Ireland was once notorious for \u201cvote early and often\u201d, and when I once confessed not to have been able to get to a polling station and vote for a pal in the south-east, he said: \u201cI know, I voted for you.\u201d</p> <p>All sorts of big cities have been plagued by wider allegations of corruption over decades, for example Glasgow and Liverpool, to cite two former Labour strongholds damaged by the corrosive impact of one-party rule. That\u2019s what elected mayors and proportional representation voting (only in some areas) were supposed to be about. My pals in Liverpool say the problems there aren\u2019t over. In Glasgow the SNP is pressing the old guard hard, which must be healthy.</p> <p>So election fraud, whereby votes are either stolen or cast under duress, is part of a wider problem that never quite goes away. The Victorians struggled with corruption too. But, as with so much, religious and racial sensibilities now complicate matters and sometimes make the authorities \u2013 police and social services as well as politicians and election officers \u2013 hesitate instead of stepping in. Pickles <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/13/uk-election-fraud-whitehall-in-denial-says-eric-pickles\">thinks so</a>.</p> <p>So let\u2019s agree with Pickles \u2013 just this once \u2013 that the law should be fairly applied to everyone and that fear of damaging community relations must not stand in the way of investigation. It was a tenacious Times reporter, Andrew Norfolk, who shone much light on electoral fraud \u2013 leading to prosecutions \u2013 and it is no coincidence that Norfolk was also a leading light in exposing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/28/rotherham-child-sex-scandal-andrew-norfolk\">sexual abuse of vulnerable girls</a> by groups of men mostly from the Pakistani community, some of them taxi drivers in Rotherham and elsewhere.</p> <p>Norfolk has said he was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d about it, so good for him. As with the Jimmy Savile scandal and others like it, there is no ethnic monopoly of this kind of crime, though cultural sensitivities gave those in authority a further excuse for inaction. Too many people make excuses and look the other way, including those fearless tabloid sensation-seekers who could have nailed Savile if they\u2019d really tried. Just like the BBC, they didn\u2019t.</p> <p>There\u2019s a risk in addressing voter fraud and other \u201csensitive\u201d problems more directly. In the present frenzied climate, it feeds the narrative about \u201cthings we\u2019re not allowed to say any more because of political correctness\u201d. Though many of Pickles\u2019 50 recommendations sound sensible, including the precaution of piloting some of them, he panders to that prejudice by using \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/11/a-wake-up-call-over-electoral-fraud/\">writing about it</a> in Friday\u2019s edition of the politically incorrect and proud of it Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>But not addressing such issues or being faced down by cynical \u201ccommunity\u201d spokesmen playing all sorts of dodgy games only serves to make matters worse in the long run. It also undermines reform-minded Britons within our ethnic minority communities who want and need support to change things they see going wrong.</p> <p>It\u2019s yet another topic Labour could think harder about when it stops fighting itself and gets on with the day job.</p>",

  "<p>On 13 August 1912, a summer evening in Prague, a young Franz Kafka was gathering up his manuscripts to take to the house of his friend, Max Brod. His excursion to the Brods\u2019 home late in the evening was not unusual, but this was an unusual night, for two momentous reasons: Kafka was about to send off what would be one of his first works to be published, and that evening he would meet the woman who would dominate his romantic imagination for the next five years.</p> <p>Felice Bauer, a cousin of the Brod family who lived in Berlin, was travelling through Prague on her way to a wedding. That night, she would meet the intense author at the Brods\u2019 dining table. According to Kafka\u2019s version of the events (and it is the only one we have, since Felice\u2019s letters were destroyed), she did not eat much and seemed reticent when he \u201coffered her his hand across the table\u201d. The few words they exchanged, her demeanour, her slippers, where she sat, where he sat, his invitation that she join him on a trip to Jerusalem, his aching self-consciousness as he (along with Max Brod\u2019s father) walked her home: all of this would form the flimsy foundation on which their relationship was built \u2013 one they would conduct almost entirely without seeing each other in person, one that Kafka scholar Elias Canetti dubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/15/john-banville-kafka-trial-rereading\">Kafka\u2019s Other Trial</a>.\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the relatively short distance between Prague and Berlin, Kafka and Bauer would meet only a handful of times, become engaged twice and never marry. But their correspondence of hundreds of letters \u2013 which finished when Kafka wrote the last letter in 1917 and only came to the world\u2019s attention in 1955, when Bauer sold his letters to her \u2013 is one of the most poignant chronicles of the human urge to share ourselves, while foregoing the vulnerability that such intimacy creates.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nothing unites two people so completely, especially if, like you and me, all they have is words</p> <footer> <cite>Kafka, in a 1912 letter to Bauer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These days, our world is dominated by the written word more than ever before. While letter-writing declines, in 2015 the average office worker received <a href=\"http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/email-statistics/\">121 emails every day</a>, their very own share of the 205bn total sent and received in total. In the second decade of the 20th century, Franz and Felice, toiling in offices in Prague and Berlin, were similarly able to count on correspondence, work and otherwise, delivered several times a day. More urgent messages came via telegram and all of it was routine enough by 1912 to be taken for granted.</p> <p>Kafka relied on the single medium of his letters to mythologise his romance with Bauer, making it, and consequently himself, far more attractive. (\u201cNothing unites two people so completely, especially if, like you and me, all they have is words,\u201d he wrote in one letter.) He used the distance between the real and virtual worlds to his advantage, in a way that is familiar today \u2013 who of us hasn\u2019t crafted a more perfect version of ourselves, in that separate online world? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33509a7967fb69f3656a8a237b2de7754ad033a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33509a7967fb69f3656a8a237b2de7754ad033a2/0_113_3748_4684/800.jpg\" alt=\"Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer in 1917.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer in 1917.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kafka resisted putting their epistolary relationship to the real-life test. After finally agreeing to meet Bauer, he sent a telegram in the morning saying he would not be coming, but went anyway \u2013 and remained sullen and withdrawn, later complaining that he had been hugely disappointed with the real Felice.</p> <p>This was predictable: a month before the visit, Kafka wrote that \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=EwVSqTfHdEAC&amp;pg=PT308&amp;lpg=PT308&amp;dq=if+one+bolts+the+doors+and+windows+against+the+world,+one+can+from+time+to+time+create+the+semblance+and+almost+the+beginning+of+the+reality+of+a+beautiful+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oZriXI4Pfu&amp;sig=o8nzscHSfAZIr6CCgdJw2qKrf8c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7hcPZwbLOAhVh3IMKHZmkBN4Q6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=if%20one%20bolts%20the%20doors%20and%20windows%20against%20the%20world%2C%20one%20can%20from%20time%20to%20time%20create%20the%20semblance%20and%20almost%20the%20beginning%20of%20the%20reality%20of%20a%20beautiful%20life&amp;f=false\">if one bolts the doors and windows against the world, one can from time to time create the semblance and almost the beginning of the reality of a beautiful life</a>\u201d. In these words, one could argue, lies a premonition of online romance. What Kafka did in lyrical prose, the rest of us bumble through on social media and dating apps today \u2013 enjoying a similar disconnect from reality.</p> <p>And make no mistake, the virtual nature of their relationship was a deliberate effort on Kafka\u2019s part: his allegiance was to writing, and the love he felt for Bauer was constructed entirely in writing, the content and frequency of which he could control. It was entirely untranslatable into an actual marriage. He\u2019d veer between contradictions on that point, too, at one point gushing that \u201cwe belong together unconditionally\u201d only to declare \u201cmarriage a scaffold\u201d weeks later.</p> <p>Reticent or eager, the internet age has made writers of us all, and even if most of us are bad ones, we gather up the small prizes of making ourselves and our virtual crushes look better than we are. Yes, our lusty, emotive missives likely lack the incandescence of Kafka\u2019s prose, but his indulgence of a romance restricted to writing gives email love a useful literary genealogy. Kafka\u2019s fiction has bestowed us with the adjective \u201cKafkaesque\u201d, pointing to the intersection of the perverse and the grotesque woven into the banalities of modern life. Kafka\u2019s love letters suggest another dimension for the term: that incongruity between who we are and who we want to be, between our desire to share our inner worlds and the fear of experiencing the consequent vulnerability that such exposure would bring into our \u201creal\u201d lives. Connection and isolation each have a cost. Virtual worlds, like letters of old, provide a partition between the two; enabled then by the postal service, and now by digital technology. </p> <p>Partition, however, is not intersection. In his romance with Felice at least, Kafka found no possibility of merging the two. The intimacy that existed on the page did not translate into attraction in reality. By the time the first engagement was broken, too much had been shared, even if only by letter, so their writing to each other continued regardless. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/may/18/kafkaesque-a-word-so-overused-it-has-lost-all-meaning\">Kafkaesque: a word so overused it has lost all meaning?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But by the second engagement, Kafka and Bauer were conclusively forced apart \u2013 Kafka\u2019s diagnosis with tuberculosis in 1917 had dashed any prospect of marriage. In his final letter to Felice, he wrote: \u201cIf we value our lives, let us abandon it all \u2026 I am forever fettered to myself, that\u2019s what I am, and that\u2019s what I must try to live with.\u201d</p> <p>This was not the end, however, to his penchant for the virtual affair: Kafka wrote his first letter to Milena Jesenska, his subsequent love, in 1920. </p>",
  "<p>Are avocados now toast, at least for the thoughtful eater?

So much so that in Michoac\u00e1n, the state that produces most of the country\u2019s avocados and arguably the world\u2019s avocado capital, growers are ignoring the law and thinning out mature pine forest to plant young avocado trees instead.</p> <p>But what\u2019s so bad about swapping one type of tree for another? Permanent forest doesn\u2019t need to be sprayed with fertilisers and pesticides. It takes care of itself and acts as a vast carbon sink. Avocado plantations, on the other hand, need repeated cycles of chemical inputs. They drink up irrigation water too, lots of it, putting pressure on local water reserves. By <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/avocados-are-the-pits\" title=\"\">one estimate</a> it takes 272 litres just to grow about half a kilogram (two or three medium-sized) avocados.</p> <p>The thirsty avocado isn\u2019t just testing water levels in Mexico either.

This lucrative trade is increasingly controlled by a <a href=\"http://www.vocativ.com/underworld/crime/avocado/\" title=\"\">drug cartel</a> known as the Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar). So when you buy a Mexican avocado, a greedy share of revenue may well accrue to criminals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I've seen fields of low-paid, often migrant workers who toil and live amid polluted water courses and pesticides</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You might think, OK, I\u2019ll buy avocados from some other less problematic source then. But would an avocado from Chile, Peru or the Dominican Republic automatically be more sustainable or equitably produced? The fact of the matter is that we know pitifully little about the environmental and working conditions of faceless people in faraway places who grow fruit for our tables, but I have seen enough of foreign fruit \u201cfarms\u201d to suspect the worst.

As Banana Link, the group that raises awareness of conditions in the global food industry, <a href=\"http://www.bananalink.org.uk/sitrabi-guatemala\" title=\"\">has documented</a>, Guatemala is the most dangerous. Any activist for fruit workers there courts summary dismissal or worse: kidnapping, torture, and murder.

This isn\u2019t an argument for boycotting imports of food that cannot be grown nearer us, but it is a powerful reason for refusing to fixate on them or fetishise them as the latest novelty \u201csuperfood\u201d.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s Mexican avocados, or tinny-tasting, air-freighted Peruvian asparagus that has drastically depleted its local water table, these foods shouldn\u2019t be a staple of our diets \u2013 unless we still have the stomach for them when their often unedifying back story is made plain to us.</p> <p>For avocados, as for crops like pineapple and bananas, we can seek out a Fairtrade label, which guarantees producers\u2019 working conditions and remuneration better than most in their industry. Fairtrade pioneers Equal Exchange have established a <a href=\"http://equalexchange.coop/our-partners/farmer-partners/pragor\" title=\"\">partnership</a> with Pragor, a progressive&#xa0;group of small-scale avocado farmers in&#xa0;Michoac\u00e1n who each own an&#xa0;average of 10 acres of land, all 100% organic. When you buy a non-Fairtrade organic avocado, you can assume that neither workers nor the environment had to bear the omnipresent health and environmental burden of repeated pesticide spraying. Isolated from Fairtrade, organic standards in themselves do not guarantee a living wage, let alone freedom from company harassment for anyone who raises that topic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/vegan-corrupt-food-system-meat-dairy\">I\u2019ve converted to veganism to reduce my impact on the living world | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nutritionally speaking, what\u2019s an avocado got that you can\u2019t get elsewhere anyway?

For monounsaturated oil, turn your attention to extra virgin olive oil, olives or lamb. To pack in the folate, go for lentils and cauliflower.

It\u2019s democratically cheap, its nutritional benefits and locavore credentials are impeccable, and it\u2019s cultivated easily in the UK.</p> <p>But when we pick up a fashionable import like avocado, we need to be sure that it not only benefits our personal health and wellbeing, but also that of the communities that grow it.</p>",

As DJs, producers, promoters, label owners and now a live act, the Belfast-born duo have played a crucial role in this decade\u2019s house music renaissance. It all began when they started a blog called Feel My Bicep in 2008. At its peak, they were posting more than 100 tracks per week, scouring the racks of record stores by day before ripping and uploading the choicest cuts by night. \u201cIt became addictive,\u201d admits Ferguson. \u201cThe more we posted, the more people would come.\u201d</p> <p>Their ability to unearth obscure disco gems, electronic oddities and lost club classics won them an audience of 100,000 visitors a month. When they graduated to DJing in 2010, it soon became clear that Bicep\u2019s blogging background, far from being a stigma, actually gave them an advantage over big-name DJs. Blogging\u2019s curatorial aspects taught them how to be versatile and educate a crowd without bashing them over the heads with music they don\u2019t want to hear. The only time they were flummoxed was when playing before Skrillex at a Swiss festival.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9jXqal7ic0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P9jXqal7ic0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cThere were probably 10,000 people there and we were playing 90s house vinyl with no real impact points,\u201d recalls McBriar of their set. \u201cAll these kids wanted to hear were rockets going off. It was flat as a pancake.\u201d Their response was to invest in analogue gear and make bespoke edits, so that those said 90s house tracks would kick hard enough to drop into a set of 2010s techno.<br></p> <p>The next logical step was for Bicep to abandon the reliance on other people\u2019s records altogether. They now make their own tunes and have a live show where they can remix them on the fly. McBriar admits that their live debut at <a href=\"http://avafestival.com/info/\">Belfast\u2019s AVA festival</a> in June was nerve-racking but \u201cbeing able to create something new in a moment and then never get it back is quite exciting\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/feelmybicep\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F92661&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Bicep are also trying to finish their debut album \u2013 a crossover record in the vein of Orbital or Moby \u2013 but they\u2019ve continued with Feel My Bicep. They might be down to about six posts a month, yet the duo still hope their write-ups provide a valuable service. \u201cWith YouTube, SoundCloud and Apple Music, people just listen to a song with a photograph of the record cover and then they click \u2018next\u2019 and there\u2019s no context,\u201d says McBriar. \u201cI struggle to find new music now, without that kind of curation,\u201d adds Ferguson.</p> <p>In a way, McBriar admits, blogging remains the very purest form of their musical evangelism. \u201cThere\u2019s no pressure for anyone to listen or dance, so you\u2019re completely free.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"http://subclub.co.uk/\">Bicep play Glasgow\u2019s Sub Club on Friday 19 August</a></strong></em></p>",

As Vincenzo Nibali and Sergio Henao lay in the road, their chances in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/olympic-mens-road-race-greg-van-avermaet\">men\u2019s event in ruins as their rivals swept past</a>, those who had pointed out the dangers of the course in advance could feel vindicated. Twenty-four hours later the sight of the motionless and crumpled form of Annemiek van Vleuten drew a horrified reaction that was only partially muted the following morning when the news came that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/annemiek-van-vleuten-intensive-care-olympic-road-race\">she was awake and talking</a>, her injuries restricted to three fractures of the lumbar vertebrae.</p> <p>Chris Boardman, the former Olympic champion and ITV4 cycling pundit, was one of those who had made warning noises in advance. \u201cThis was way past technical,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cThis was dangerous.\u201d He was referring to the kerbstones lining both sides of the descent: not the kind of thing, three or four inches high, that you find on a normal street. These stones were 12 inches tall and impossible to avoid if you left the road. When Van Vleuten somersaulted off her bike at high speed, many thoughts turned to the accident 21 years ago that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jul/16/tourdefrance2005.tourdefrance1\">took the life of Fabio Casartelli</a> when the young Italian rider\u2019s head hit a concrete block on a descent in the Tour de France. Luckily for the Dutch woman, it was her back that caught the kerbing\u2019s sharp edge.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/lizzie-armitstead-falters-rio-olympics-road-race-cycling-glare-suspicion\">Britain\u2019s Lizzie Armitstead falters in Rio road race under the glare of suspicion | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others disagreed with Boardman, pointing out that the riders had not crashed because of the kerbstones. They had lost control on the road itself, through misjudging the equation of speed and roadholding. They knew the hazards \u2013 in the case of the men, they were taking the descent for the third and last time that day \u2013 and should have adjusted their approach. Their bikes have brakes, after all.</p> <p>In such a case, how much responsibility rests with the people who devise the course, and how much with the people who agree to race on it? This is a tricky question, and I put it this week to Professor Jeff McMahan, a 61-year-old former Rhodes scholar from South Carolina and an expert on ethical matters who now holds the White\u2019s chair of moral philosophy at Oxford University, a post dating back to 1621.</p> <p>\u201cI think the responsibility is shared between the people \u2013 including the organisers \u2013 involved in a race to be done over terrain that presents risks, and those who participate and choose to take those risks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I tend to think that the responsibility falls chiefly with the organisers. The participants will have committed themselves way in advance and, as competitors in a race, their tendency will be not to apply the brakes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3e6317d75559ee19ac297dad5daaeea04d90d8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3e6317d75559ee19ac297dad5daaeea04d90d8e/0_80_3852_2311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands led the Rio Road Race until she had an ugly crash.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands led the Rio Road Race until she had an ugly crash.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Few involved in bike racing, however, would want to see their sport go the way of Formula One, from which almost all sense of physical risk has been eliminated. In place of the trees, ditches and stone walls that once defined the limits, today\u2019s grand prix circuits are marked out with harmless painted lines.</p> <p>Elsewhere, however, people go on willingly putting their lives at risk, sometimes with fatal results that draw a slightly different response. The last few days have seen obituaries of Matilda Rapaport, a 30-year-old Swedish extreme skier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/matilda-rapaport-killed-avalanche-chile\">killed in an avalanche in the Chilean Andes</a>, and of Sam Wheeler, a 72-year-old engineer from California who died after losing control of his streamlined motorcycle on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. He was on a test run, part of a programme through which he hoped to regain the world record by raising the mark beyond 400mph.</p> <p>Rapaport, whose parents were both skiers, took to the snow at the age of two and became a champion. Earlier this year she married Mattias Hargin, a World Cup slalom skier whom she had known since her schooldays. Wheeler was equally immersed in his project and its world. \u201cIt\u2019s a goal I\u2019ve had all my life to have the fastest motorcycle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had it a couple of times, but somehow that didn\u2019t end it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/12/rio-olympics-2016-day-six-cycling-athletics-rowing-doping\">Rio Olympics 2016: Team GB aims to add to cycling gold, and athletics starts \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You can be sad for those people, and for their family and friends, but you can\u2019t really think of their deaths as tragedies. Just like Nibali and Van Vleuten, they knew what they were facing. To reduce the level of risk would be to diminish \u2013 to themselves, if to no one else \u2013 the value of what they were doing.</p> <p>Professor McMahan has a view on this. \u201cMost people are lured into participating in sports when they\u2019re young,\u201d he said. \u201cIt usually starts before they\u2019re 10 years old and accelerates in their teenage years, which is when they become adept at it and the sorting-out between the talented and the less talented takes place. And this is a period in life when people are notoriously bad at assessing risk, and with identifying with themselves later in life. They don\u2019t spend much time thinking about that. The brain\u2019s pre-frontal cortex, the centre of executive decision-making, isn\u2019t fully developed until after the age of 20. But if people who\u2019ve reached autonomous adulthood want to go and do such things, then to restrict them looks like an objectionable form of paternalism.</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, if competent adults want to place a rope between two tall buildings and walk along it, I don\u2019t think we should prevent them. But maybe we shouldn\u2019t cheer so much when they succeed. It might help if we responded by saying, \u2018Well, they made it \u2013 but what a foolish thing to do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>McMahan points to the diminishing popularity of boxing \u2013 \u201cone person beating another person senseless \u2013 the pure violence of gladiatorial combat, like ancient Rome \u2013 with people in middle age developing cognitive deficiencies as a result of repeated concussions\u201d \u2013 as a sign of moral progress. \u201cPeople are recoiling from that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an advance in terms of civilisation.\u201d</p> <p>Fair enough. So was Boardman right that the Olympic race organisers made a mistake in requiring the riders to take that descent from the Vista Chinesa last weekend, with its unprotected high kerbstones? On balance, I suppose he was. But a world without unreasonable risks, and the chance to admire the people willing to take them, would seem a less appealing place to be.</p>",

  "<p>In the summer of 2014, a child came to stay with us. She was a teenage friend of one of my children and in desperate need of a home. Her own family had broken down and her father, who she had been living with, had severe mental health problems. She had been through a very rough time and had some mental health issues of her own. We have a nice house, plenty of energy and resources, and we loved her and we wanted to do something committed and long term to change her life. My husband and I decided to begin the process of applying to be foster parents. </p> <p>One of my children has learning disabilities and consequently the one thing we felt confident about was being up to the challenge of dealing with authorities, naysayers and those with limiting ideas about children\u2019s potential, because we had already met plenty of those.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/aug/03/social-workers-learn-from-experience-care\">Social workers, please learn from my experience in care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reality of what came next was a horrible shock. At every step of the way, we were prevented from having a role in this girl\u2019s life. Despite doing everything required, social services not finding any cause for concern and the child saying she wanted to be permanently fostered with our family; it took 18 months before she was legally allowed to stay. And that was only because she turned 16 and was able to live with us under the supported lodging system. All because of mismanagement, bureaucracy and silly rules. </p> <p>How can the system make it so hard for parents willing to foster or adopt \u2013 even when you\u2019ve raised children of your own and are willing to undergo training, vetting and whatever is required? If we had not stepped in, I know where our daughter (and this is how I think of her) would have ended up because she spent several nights there at the outset \u2013 in a children\u2019s home. She once texted me from there crying and begged me to come and get her. I broke the law in responding and picking her up to spend the night in the home of a respected foster mother whom she liked. I did not risk bringing her to our house that first weekend because we had not then been police checked at the time and I feared this would have been seen as abduction.</p> <p>During those 18 months, we were passed from pillar to post and she had nine different social workers. Some would be fired or go off sick, another admitted losing all our paperwork. All of them were young, and several had not read her notes and asked her to repeat over and over intimate and painful details of the circumstances that brought her into the care system. For example: when asked about her plans, she said excitedly that she hoped to go to university, the social worker said smartly: \u201cHow realistic is that?\u201d Very realistic indeed, I\u2019d say, and we intend to make it happen, but this social worker had not bothered to read the school notes which predicted my daughter As and A*s.</p> <p>In the end, we were lucky to get a great social worker. She was different from the others, partly because she was more senior and therefore able to exercise her judgment. She got to know us by spontaneously popping round and she could see for herself that our family home was a good place for our daughter. She explained how arduous the supported lodging process would be, including a nine hour interview and a lot of paperwork for her, but said if we were up for it, she was too. Now our daughter is legally with us, she is so much happier. She also sees her birth father more now because we have made it possible. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/jun/24/foster-families-care-relationships-social-work\">When my foster brother died, I realised the care system must change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Social workers always say the views of the child are paramount, but so many did not listen to her when she repeatedly said she wanted to be with us.

  "<p>The former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham has accused wildlife presenter Chris Packham of being an extremist and using his position at the BBC to promote his views on restricting grouse shooting.</p> <p>The pair clashed in a joint interview on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on the opening day of the grouse-shooting season, \u2013 or the \u201cinglorious twelfth\u201d as Packham called it.</p> <p>Botham, who is a keen shooter and the figurehead for You Forgot the Birds \u2013 an organisation that represents the views of the shooting industry and has attacked the RSPB \u2013 said that grouse shooting promoted stewardship of the environment. \u201cIt\u2019s the gamekeepers who look after the moors,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s only people like Chris that want to sabotage nature by banning success.\u201d</p> <p>But Packham countered that raising grouse by excluding predators from the moors was detrimental to the environment. \u201cGrouse moors are extraordinarily ecologically damaged,\u201d he said, adding that burning and draining the moors also had a big impact. </p> <p>\u201cOur campaign is evidentially based and scientifically based,\u201d said the Springwatch presenter and vice-president of the RSPB. \u201cWhat we are seeing is the removal of our birds of prey. What\u2019s controversial about asking for the law to be upheld?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeefy\u2019s batting on a sticky wicket,\u201d he added.</p> <p>He said there was ample evidence that rare birds of prey were being deliberately killed on grouse moors by gamekeepers in order to keep grouse numbers high. He said eight golden eagles that were electronically tagged had gone missing over grouse moors last year and that there were only three breeding pairs of hen harriers in England. There should be 300, he said.</p> <p>Botham said that there had been no prosecutions for killing birds of prey last year but Packham argued it was extremely difficult to gather evidence and secure convictions on the \u201cdark satanic moors\u201d.</p> <p>The grouse-shooting season lasts from 12 August to 10 December and grouse moors cover 1.5m hectares in the UK, <a href=\"https://basc.org.uk/game-and-gamekeeping/game-shooting-2/grouse-shooting/\">according to the British Association for Shooting and Conservation</a>. The industry <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.moorlandassociation.org/grouse-shooting-economics/\">employs 1,500 people full time</a> in England.</p> <p>Countryside groups and the government say grouse shooting is a legitimate activity that brings significant benefits to the rural economy, and that management by gamekeepers helps other moorland bird species. They say that as well as protecting grouse, keeping fox numbers low allows birds such as lapwings, curlews and golden plovers to thrive.</p> <p>Packham was the subject of a complaint after describing those involved in hunting and shooting as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/01/chris-packham-slams-shameful-silence-of-britains-conservation-charities\">\u201cthe nasty brigade\u201d</a> in a magazine article.

Asylum politics is a wretched amoral swamp, a place where facts don\u2019t matter and hysteria regularly trumps reality.</p> <p>But if we get mired in our routine of this issue being seemingly hopeless and intractable, we can miss the small glimmers of hope, harbingers of movement. To see these, we have to look a little deeper.</p> <p>The first little pulse of hope this week came from the prime minister. Malcolm Turnbull didn\u2019t fire up the predictable asylum culture war hooey when asked about the Nauru files. He said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/nauru-files-widespread-condemnation-of-australian-government-by-un-and-others\">the government would review the incident reports</a> uncovered in this week\u2019s reports to see whether action had been taken. Not much, but not nothing either.</p> <p>The next came from the Liberal MP Russell Broadbent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/liberal-mp-russell-broadbent-appeals-to-people-of-conscience-after-release-of-nauru-files\">who poked his nose above the parapet</a> this week to observe that checks and balances matter, and it might be time to check whether the checks and balances were adequate to protect the safety of people in immigration detention.</p> <p>The intervention looks modest, but it isn\u2019t if you consider a couple of things: Broadbent doesn\u2019t chase ambulances, he intervenes when he means it. The Victorian moderate was also key in persuading John Howard to wind back the worst of his punitive immigration regime during the last period of Coalition government \u2013 and Broadbent is evidently galvanised sufficiently to put his view on the record at a moment when the Liberal party is awash with tribalism, pugilism, internal contention and mulish retribution.</p> <p>Then we can look to Labor. We know that Labor has been obsessed with \u201cme tooism\u201d on asylum policy in a desperate bid to avoid the apparently unbearable inconvenience of a Daily Telegraph smash up and a Ray Hadley tantrum about their collective lack of manhood when it comes to repelling the hordes plotting a comfortable sea path to Australia before reclining on a life of welfare.</p> <p>But a couple of things happened this week. The new opposition spokesman on immigration, Shayne Neumann, was very quick out of the blocks after the Nauru files were published, signalling a private member\u2019s bill to improve reporting on Nauru, and making the case for a children\u2019s advocate. Internally, the speed of the response was noted, a slight change of intention and emphasis.</p> <p>In addition to that signal, various caucus members were quick to send their own twofold message: the revelations from the Nauru files were completely and utterly abhorrent; and Labor\u2019s internal debate over the right policy balance between hardline deterrence and human rights was not over.</p> <p>This is interesting too, because post-election, we (and Bill Shorten) might have expected the boats issue to settle placidly in Labor after the departure of two serial campaigners for change, Melissa Parke and Anna Burke. Not by the looks of things. The caucus disquiet about Labor\u2019s positioning will persist into this new parliament. You can set your watch by that prediction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2016/aug/10/twelve-of-the-most-harrowing-accounts-from-the-nauru-files-in-pictures\">Twelve of the most harrowing accounts from the Nauru files \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then we can look at the new crossbench. There has been a lot of analysis in recent times about the new forces of populism and protectionism and xenophobia that are manifest in the new 45th parliament, which is both true, and a big deal, and a cliche that risks overshadowing a more complex reality.</p> <p>Yes, those forces are part of this next term. But there are also people now in the parliament who will stand up against the abuse of children, wherever they happen to be.</p> <p>Late this week I undertook a quick test of parliamentary support for Labor\u2019s proposed private member\u2019s bill to see where the numbers might lie, and I also wanted to test the resting disposition of some of the new kingmakers to the revelations about Nauru published this week.</p> <p>I learned a couple of things in this sortie. I think if Labor brought on its bill in the Senate, and if it brought forward a proposal for a children\u2019s advocate for kids on Nauru, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/nauru-files-labor-optimistic-about-strengthening-rules-on-reporting-abuse-of-refugees\">it is very likely to get support in the upper house</a>.</p> <p>A quick out take from my conversations. The Greens are a yes, because they are diligent and tireless on this issue. Nick Xenophon was disturbed by the Guardian\u2019s reports, and was positive in principle. Derryn Hinch said the Nauru papers \u201cwere awful reading\u201d and he thought the Coalition had a tendency to shoot the messenger when it came to offshore detention, so he\u2019s interested in having a look at what can be done, and Jacqui Lambie said she\u2019d look positively at what Labor brought forward.</p> <p>That\u2019s a majority, at least in-principle, right off the bat. An incremental improvement for sure, but on this issue, sensible people take what they can get. There would be sympathy too, in the House \u2013 probably not a majority, but certainly sympathy.</p> <p>Take the independent MP Cathy McGowan, who has bucked conventional wisdom by taking a public stand on human rights despite representing a deeply conservative rural electorate. Conservative opponents ran hard against McGowan in the recent election for siding with the Greens on immigration matters, and it resonated, it was a big issue locally, but, interestingly, the community stuck with her.</p> <p>McGowan worked quietly in the last parliament with a cross-party group, which included a couple of Liberals, Labor people and the Greens, to get children out of detention. This quiet lobbying effort came at the behest of the combined heads of congregations, and a group of Catholic nuns, who are very active behind the scenes trying to persuade the parliament of Australia to protect the human rights of vulnerable people. They didn\u2019t advertise the effort and make it a confrontation, they just looked for solutions.</p> <p>The modest outbreak of empathy suggests the new parliament could (and I wouldn\u2019t rate it higher than could) give rise to another cross-party effort to come up with a solution to a deeply vexed problem. We saw this happen in the 43rd minority parliament.</p> <p>This would be superficially promising, but the recent past tells us such enterprises tend to collapse under their own disparate weight. Parliamentarians see different facts, and intuit different solutions, so the common ground tends to get hollowed out when people attempt to forge an agreed multi-partisan position.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/former-save-the-children-workers-say-nauru-files-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg\">Former Save the Children workers say Nauru files 'just the tip of the iceberg'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then you only have to contemplate a well-meaning group of MPs meeting the immovable object that is Peter Dutton, and the former immigration minister, Scott Morrison, and you see the fruitlessness of the exercise.</p> <p>If change is going to happen, we need the following conditions.</p> <p>There has to be a clear tipping point. Broadbent here is a good barometer, given he was a key part of the civilising forces on the old Howard policy. If he\u2019s putting his head up, that suggests an experienced parliamentary hand thinks the tipping point is now close.</p> <p>I can imagine it being close if I just think for a moment of a Don Dale-style video emerging cataloguing some horror on Nauru. I don\u2019t want to put my mind there, or yours, but I suspect you can imagine various scenarios that would be more compelling and cut-through than the Dutton talking points.</p> <p>There has to be consistent pressure from outside the parliament, and I don\u2019t mean abstract intermittent pressure from well meaning advocates: I mean a campaign. From churches, who remain very powerful in politics, from community groups, in marginal seats. If it\u2019s organised, consistent, broadly based and targeted, that will capture the attention of parliamentarians in very short order.</p> <p>Media organisations dedicated to serving the public interest and speaking truth to power also have to double down on this story. We need to keep pushing, delving, unearthing factual examples that can\u2019t be lightly dismissed, and reporters have to be given time to investigate, which is possibly the greatest luxury going in an era of cash-strapped organisations and shrinking newsrooms.</p> <p>If the prime minister wants to do more than review incident reports, if he wants to actually intervene to clean up a diabolical system being perpetrated in our name, then he has to follow the template set by the man Turnbull has recently taken to calling his mentor: John Howard.</p> <p>When Howard eventually resolved the government had to move, he didn\u2019t just issue an abstract instruction and leave it to his portfolio minister. He got his department head, Peter Shergold, to set up an interdepartmental taskforce to delve into the facts of what was going on in detention, and develop a pathway to concrete action.</p> <p>Leadership is more than saying abstractly you would like something looked at. You have to activate all the tools of the office of prime minister, otherwise the studied inertia of opponents to change means nothing happens.</p> <p>Turnbull faces rolling challenges to his authority, but the prime minister remains capable of action. He didn\u2019t wait for permission when it came to juvenile justice in the Northern Territory. He can stand up for what is right, and given his current position, standing up for what is right is better than constant conciliation and compromise, which thus far has bought him nothing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/gillian-triggs-says-onus-on-australian-public-to-change-detention-policy-after-nauru-files-leak\">Gillian Triggs says public pressure can change detention policy after Nauru files leak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as authority, and process, there also needs to be clarity about what is actually wrong here, otherwise all kinds of temporary solutions can be produced by politicians that are designed to lull and soothe the conscience of the voting public rather than actually materially benefit people who are, beyond any reasonable doubt, being systemically abused.</p> <p>Here are the first principles.</p> <p>Australia has every right to defend the integrity of its borders. In an era of acute globalisation fatigue, where sovereignty is now a potent part of domestic political discussion around the world, any national government has to try to counter the retrograde forces of racism and xenophobia with reassuring messaging about border security. But there\u2019s a choice about how you do this.</p> <p>Turnbull has shown you can turn around a whole potent political discussion by replacing apocalyptic dog whistling with rational, proportionate discussion. He\u2019s done it on national security. If so inclined, he can do it on asylum as well. We could, for a start, stop talking about this issue as if punitive policy is the only way we can stop people drowning at sea. False binaries just feed the cycle of irrationality, and rational discussion could even presage rational action, you never know.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t just about what we are saying. We do need to be very clear-eyed about the problem the Australian parliament needs to address. The deep problem here is one of substance.</p> <p>Right now, a liberal democracy, Australia \u2013 a country we all love and are proud to call our home \u2013 is holding a group of people, indefinitely, in offshore immigration detention.</p> <p>These people have not committed any crime. Some of the people are children.</p> <p>The people being detained offshore at Australia\u2019s behest, essentially because of an outbreak of irrationality and extreme cynicism in Australia\u2019s political system, are not safe. They are being harmed, and in a state of contagion and despair, they are harming themselves. The evidence for this is overwhelming.</p> <p>I make only one request of readers this weekend. Find some time to focus on what we actually are doing in our offshore detention policy. The enormity of what we are doing can be captured with this simple observation: when it comes to indefinite detention, we are treating people on Nauru, people who have fled persecution, more punitively than criminals, more harshly than murderers and rapists. Criminals have a release date, people detained on Nauru do not.</p> <p>It\u2019s unconscionable, and we have to own it, because owning our collective travesty without rationalisations and weasel words is the first step towards having the moral clarity to change it.</p>",

It lacks the grandeur of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and the elegance of Boulevard Saint-Germain, but its activity is concentrated: it\u2019s home to nearly 200 small shops and restaurants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1530d3895d702862367b5a1cb647db3f76f12fce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1530d3895d702862367b5a1cb647db3f76f12fce/0_929_3600_3884/927.jpg\" alt=\"Elaine Sciolino\" width=\"927\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elaine Sciolino</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriela Plump</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I am an outsider in Paris, with American-accented French,</strong> so I am part of the wave of globalisation that threatens to destroy a street like the rue des Martyrs. Yet I\u2019ve been accepted into this tight-knit community. I have tried to make friends with almost everyone on the narrow stretch that slopes upwards into the base of Montmartre: the octogenarian showman who\u2019s been running a transvestite cabaret for more than half a century, the woman who repairs 18th-century mercury barometers, the philosophy-loving owner of a 100-year-old bookstore. I\u2019ve spent so much time on this street that the merchants and residents have embraced me and made me part of their lives.</p> <p><a href=\"http://restaurantmiroir.com/\"><strong>Restaurant Miroir</strong></a><strong>, at the top of the street, is my go-to bistro.</strong> Just about every evening before dinner is served, owner S\u00e9bastien Gu\u00e9nard steps outside to greet passersby. He needs to connect with the neighbourhood where he works and lives. Gu\u00e9nard always keeps three or four tables free, just in case special friends show up. You won\u2019t be pushed out early for a second sitting; you\u2019ll be encouraged to linger as long as you like.</p> <p><strong>This is a serious street. It made history.</strong> Tradition has it that Saint Denis, the patron saint of France, was beheaded here in the third century. Thomas Jefferson frequented the area and I am convinced that from time to time I see his ghost. Edgar Degas and Pierre-Auguste Renoir painted acrobats at the circus on the corner, Emile Zola situated a lesbian dinner club here in his novel Nana, and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut filmed scenes from Les 400 Coups. Rue des Martyrs is mentioned in Gustave Flaubert\u2019s L\u2019Education Sentimentale, arguably the most influential French novel of the 19th century, and in Guy de Maupassant\u2019s Bel-Ami.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1559e2dc8d725af2b053f47719709e5068caa73b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1559e2dc8d725af2b053f47719709e5068caa73b/0_0_1083_726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bookshop on rue des Martys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bookshop on rue des Martys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriela Plump</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>But the street is not stuck in the past.</strong> Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, and local rock band Phoenix have recorded at Motorbass, a state-of-the-art music studio hidden behind an old wooden door painted glossy magenta.

  "<p>So a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/patricia-lynch-john-hennigan-complaints-made-after-judge-trades-insults-with-defendant-in-court\">woman judge is abused</a> as \u201ca bit of a cunt\u201d who should \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d by a racist thug whom she has just jailed. She hits back that he too is \u201ca bit of a cunt\u201d and he too should fuck off. To adapt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/14/selected-letters-charles-dickens-review\">Oscar Wilde on the death of Little Nell</a>, it would take a heart of stone not to cheer.</p> <p>Judge Patricia Lynch QC has duly become a hero to the retributive classes. Give these people a taste of their own medicine, is the cry. Show them who is boss. Meanwhile, there are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-37046806\">inevitable complaints</a> to the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office. Is this an appropriate way to sentence a man to a year and half in prison? Is this how we expect our judges to behave?</p> <p>The best answer in this case is clearly to forget it. Neither antagonist is likely to gain from further inquiry into what was a spur of the moment exchange. The judge is clearly vulnerable to the charge of sinking to the level of the man she was jailing, ironically for using abusive language in a public place. Her heroism must also be heavily larded with gender bias. Would the social media have idolised a white male judge who used such words in convicting a woman?</p> <p>Yet such vignettes focus attention on everyday life in a British crown court. The accused, John Hennigan, was convicted of a ninth breach of an antisocial behaviour order in 11 years. This and previous breaches mostly involved shouting abuse and making Nazi gestures at various people, including ethnic minorities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/patricia-lynch-john-hennigan-complaints-made-after-judge-trades-insults-with-defendant-in-court\">Complaints made after judge trades insults with defendant in court</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to Hennigan\u2019s defence lawyer, he is \u201can unfortunate man \u2026 diagnosed and medicated for depression\u201d. He is single, obese and lives alone. It must be inconceivable that a few months in jail will rehabilitate, deter or in any way make this man better able to control himself. It will only briefly relieve those whom he has upset by his behaviour. More likely, jail will make his life and his behaviour considerably worse.</p> <p>Hennigan is clearly an antisocial menace. But asbos are discredited as forms of public discipline, both for their heavy-handedness and for lack of evidence that they are any real deterrent to bad behaviour. Putting offenders in prison is a nuclear option, as against other forms of community punishment or restraint. Yet British judges do so with a frequency unknown in other European countries, and at ever growing cost to the state.</p> <p>Of course the judge should not have said what she said. But the fracas will have been worth it if someone asks why she felt it in the best interests of society for this troubled man to have the rest of his life blighted by a prison record.</p>",
  "<p>This week has been a grand experiment for me. In 2012, I consumed the Olympics exclusively through iPlayer and red button coverage. And it was amazing. You could pick an event from a giant menu, and watch the whole thing from start to finish without ever worrying that Hazel Irvine would burst into frame and angrily demand that you change channel so that someone\u2019s mum could watch EastEnders. It was fuss-free. It was perfect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/12/rio-olympics-2016-day-six-cycling-athletics-rowing-doping\">Rio Olympics 2016: Team GB aims to add to cycling gold, and athletics starts \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this year, I\u2019m doing things the old way, and watching BBC1s infinite Grandstand of an Olympic show throughout the day and night. Why? Because I wanted to see if it still had a purpose. And it does, but only just.</p> <p>To begin with, some sports are just not meant for TV, like shooting. It\u2019s just people standing completely still in total silence for ages, and then a target the size of a fifth of a pixel pops up, and then there\u2019s a bang, and nobody can tell what\u2019s happening, and then it ends. Apparently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/steven-scott-tim-kneale-shooting-double-trap-great-britain-rio\">a British guy won a bronze medal</a>, but I was too busy trying not to get deep-vein thrombosis in my brain to notice.</p> <p>The main BBC set, meanwhile \u2013 which would be all but completely hidden from view if you only watched iPlayer \u2013 is a mess. Since the games are being held in South America, it\u2019s been done up to resemble an unloved Mexican restaurant with a disappointing Food Standards Agency hygiene rating. Also, the sound beds they use under the menu are so tinny and ersatz that I honestly thought it was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBBP_xOyLOQ\">Supermarket Sweep theme tune</a> first time I heard it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"85e252806104cc905912e8c9512784e4938c593c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e252806104cc905912e8c9512784e4938c593c/0_0_4211_2527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bo-ring!

When you\u2019re used to picking and choosing events, the prospect of spending an hour and a half watching something as mind-numbing as three-day eventing can completely sap you of enthusiasm. In a way, it was good that the sight of several identical men making several identical horses jump over several identical obstacles was so tedious, because it robbed me of the energy necessary to lobotomise myself with a coathanger.</p> <p>I could also do without the soggy filler items. The 10 minutes that was given over to Adrian Moorhouse describing what it was like to do press about Adam Peaty\u2019s gold medal. The long One Show-esque segment about what horses are like. All the endless fascination with parents and siblings and spouses of athletes. All this stuff kills momentum. The Olympics are a sporting event, and these films are the exact scientific opposite of sport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/how-the-usa-womens-gymnastics-team-swept-to-olympic-gold\">How the USA women\u2019s gymnastics team swept to Olympic gold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is one exception to this, however. Before the table tennis coverage on Wednesday, BBC1 showed a short film about the history of the sport in 20th-century China; about Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution, the suicides of the national team in 1968 and the subsequent rise of ping-pong diplomacy. This film was so fascinating and thoughtful and well-made \u2013 I wish it was on iPlayer to show you \u2013 that I spent the afternoon ignoring the actual event in favour of reading up on the subject. Stuff like this, stuff that puts the games into an accessible historical context, almost validates the BBC1 coverage alone.</p> <p>Of course, on BBC1 you also get the presenters. For a while, I was disappointed with their workaday links that could have come from anywhere in the world. Matt Baker\u2019s schoolboy enthusiasm \u2013 \u201cHoo! Would you look at that!\u201d \u2013 only takes you so far, and even Clare Balding\u2019s forays out into the Olympic park have felt underpowered and sanitised.

Because, uniquely within the BBC presenting team, Inverdale cannot believe that he\u2019s in Brazil. He genuinely cannot believe it. This is all his Christmases come at once. And in his excitement, he has unwittingly turned into Alan Partridge. Forget the sport or the medals or the enduring spirit of excellence. For me, the defining moment of the Olympics came on Monday, when Inverdale just abandoned any pretence that he was hosting a sporting event and began to describe what a James Bond film set in Ipanema would be like.</p> <p>\u201cSee that building over there?\u201d he babbled, pointing out a dot on the side of a mountain. \u201cThat\u2019s where the baddie lives.\u201d Then, adopting his best Bond villain voice, he regaled us with the classic 007 catchphrase: \u201cCome to my house, Mr Bond.\u201d</p> <p>At this stage, I\u2019m only watching the Olympics in the vain hope that we will soon see John Inverdale doing action rolls in the sand and pew-pewing tourists with his finger-guns. Truly, this is the spirit of the Olympics made flesh. Like it or not, it\u2019s definitely not the sort of thing you get on iPlayer.</p>",
  "<p>Graeme Macrae Burnet\u2019s second novel from the crime imprint of the tiny Scottish publisher Saraband, a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/27/man-booker-prize-2016-longlist-jm-coetzee\" title=\"\">surprise inclusion on the Man Booker longlist</a>, is a slippery creature indeed. It\u2019s a psychological thriller masquerading as a slice of true crime; a&#xa0;collection of \u201cfound\u201d documents that play lovingly with the&#xa0;traditions of Scottish literature; an artful portrait of a&#xa0;remote crofting community in the 19th century that showcases contemporary theories about class and criminology. The book is&#xa0;also a blackly funny investigation into&#xa0;madness and motivation, which perhaps leads no further than one&#xa0;character\u2019s grim conclusion: \u201cOne man can no more see into the mind of another than he can see inside a stone.\u201d</p> <p>Subtitled \u201cDocuments relating to the case of Roderick Macrae\u201d, <em>His</em> <em>Bloody Project</em> contains the 17-year-old crofter\u2019s memoir, written while awaiting trial in Inverness in 1869 for three brutal murders, and \u201cdiscovered\u201d by the author while researching his own Highland roots. This manuscript, we are teasingly informed, divided the Edinburgh literati of the time, who feared a rerun of James Macpherson\u2019s 18th-century literary hoax <em>Ossian</em> and considered it \u201cquite inconceivable that a semi-literate peasant could produce such a sustained and eloquent piece of writing\u201d. The apparently guileless account of how Roderick did indeed enter the house of his overbearing neighbour with <em>croman</em>, <em>flaughter</em> and murderous intent (a glossary is provided) is complicated by witness statements, medical reports and a&#xa0;journalistic account of the trial. It also includes a&#xa0;psychological report on Roderick by the real-life prison doctor James Bruce Thomson, who has firm opinions on the characteristics and proclivities of the \u201ccriminal class\u201d.</p> <p>Roderick confesses from the start his&#xa0;desire to rid the world of Lachlan Mackenzie, who as local constable is invested with power to keep the community in check, and uses it to make Roddy\u2019s life even more of a misery than it already was. But is he insane to lash out, or only to admit to it? Was he always \u201cwrong in the head\u201d, as some of&#xa0;his neighbours maintain, or have grinding poverty and harsh treatment pushed a bright boy over the edge? Can new anthropological theories of \u201cmoral insanity\u201d and \u201cmoral imbecility\u201d explain his behaviour, or are they no different from the minister\u2019s lofty condemnation of \u201cthe natural state of savagism\u201d in which his peasant congregation dwells?</p> <p>The descriptions of the crofting community, scratching a living from ungenerous soil, at the mercy of the laird, the church and the weather, are fascinatingly done. The strongest driver of the book\u2019s momentum towards tragedy is a doomy stoicism that assigns every mishap to the mostly inauspicious workings of providence. \u201cThe outlook in these parts is that if one is to be visited by misfortune, there is nothing that can be done to avoid it.\u201d There\u2019s a healthy dose of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/franzkafka\" title=\"\">Kafka</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/flannobrien\" title=\"\">Flann O\u2019Brien</a> in Roderick\u2019s account of laboriously gathering seaweed from the shoreline with his father to spread on the fields, then being forced by Lachlan to return&#xa0;it to the sea because they lack the laird\u2019s permission to use his property. When they summon up the courage to seek clarification of the rules that govern their lives, they are told \u201cthat a person wishing to consult the regulations could only wish to do so in&#xa0;order to test the limits of the misdemeanours he might commit\u201d. Stoicism and occasional outbursts of&#xa0;violence begin to look like the only possible responses to a world in which you have no power at all. From his jail cell, Roderick repeatedly comments on the absurdity of the fact that it is only murder that has made people treat him like a gentleman.</p> <p>The book\u2019s pretence at veracity, as well as being a literary <em>jeux d\u2019esprit</em>, brings an extraordinary historical period into focus, while the multiple unreliable perspectives are designed to&#xa0;keep the audience wondering, throughout the novel and beyond. This is a fiendishly readable tale that richly deserves the wider attention the&#xa0;Booker has brought it.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>His Bloody Project</em> for \u00a37.37 (RRP \u00a38.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/his-bloody-project.html\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Festival</a> \u2013 one of the longest-running annual LGBTQ arts and culture festivals in the world. After six weeks, it closes on Saturday. </p> <p>The festival showcased plenty more gay theater, as well, including<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://mtf.nyc/projects/boys-who-tricked-me/\">Boys Who Tricked Me</a>, a musical about love disguised as preteen sleepover, <a href=\"http://dixonplace.org/performances/ignorance-is-no-excuse-reno-2/\">Ignorance is No Excuse</a> by Reno, the standup comic and former reality star of Bravo\u2019s Citizen Reno, and<a href=\"http://dixonplace.org/performances/unearthing-plus-a-girl-in-rags/\"> Unearthing \u2013 Plus \u2013 A Girl in Rags</a>, a semi-autobiographical play that dissects blackness and transgenderism.</p> <p>Even Covan can\u2019t quite figure out the reasons Dixon Place still has a LGBTQ festival when the theater is imbued all year round with \u201cthe spirit of queer \u2026 community, intimacy, sensualism. What could be hotter?\u201d</p> <p>Covan is the daughter of two community theater directors and was brought up in a suburb outside Houston, Texas. After acting at university in Austin, then moving to Paris, Covan arrived on the Lower East Side in the mid-80s, when downtown theater had its second coming in New York. Dixon Place officially began in 1986, based on a poetry and fiction reading salon Covan had hosted in Paris, and named after the publisher of her favorite books.</p> <p>AM Holmes says that Covan has aways been at the heart of the venue. \u201cThe secret sauce to Dixon Place is Ellie herself, her accordion playing, her eccentric and exuberant selfless joy and passion for the performing arts, for arts and performers who truly bare their souls \u2013 and sometimes a little more.\u201d</p> <p>Monstah Black says that Dixon Place enabled him to direct a show and write dialogue for the first time, describing it as \u201ca laboratory for artists, where we can explore new places and new territory and create the chaos without having it in front of us all the time\u201d. The place encourages artists to take risks \u2013 to push themselves and their material into places that might be uncomfortable or unknown and to do with with the full embrace of the room.</p> <p>The artistic disarray, however, was one of the chief reasons Covan moved Dixon Place from her former home \u2013 a small terraced apartment whose cleared living area served as a stage and a corner kitchen doubled as a bar \u2013 eventually into its current abode in the Lower East Side. </p> <p>Covan started charging about $2 for admission, giving the proceeds to the artists who included the likes of the Blue Man Group, <a href=\"http://www.deb-margolin.com/\">Deb Margolin</a>, <a href=\"http://yaddo.org/yaddo/DavidCale2.shtml\">David Cale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/28/penny-arcade-interview-longing-lasts-longer-new-york\">Penny Arcade</a> and Reno. Realizing her untenable business model, she eventually established a nonprofit, bought and renovated the Chrystie Street location and opened in 2009 with a liquor license, a lounge and space for rental, in addition to the theater. </p> <p>\u201cWhen it was in my living room, Dixon Place was a lot simpler and sometimes a lot more fun because there was no pressure to keep the lights on, so to speak\u201d, Covan says, as a photograph of Arthur Rimbaud looked down at her desk. \u201cThe struggle here is to balance the sale of tickets \u2013 and to keep those as rock-bottom as possible \u2013 with the ability to explore new work that\u2019s diverse. </p> <p>\u201cThe math just isn\u2019t there when you have a theater that costs $1,500 per day to run and tickets at $15 each. We have to push the artists to bring in people. Our donors generally understand the value of our project, but educating the public, who like to categorize things, is sometimes a different story. That\u2019s why we have the bar.\u201d</p> <p>One a recent Friday night, visitors who found the small storefront and walked past the bar \u2013 and the same Dixon place staffer who served as hostess, bartender and occasional box office proprietor \u2013 were treated to a performance by Dandy Darkly, a burlesque and satiric vaudeville clown in a glittery 70s disco suit and platform shoes. Downstairs, Black and his troupe were vogueing through a Prince-inspired soundtrack during the \u201cvery last party on earth\u201d. </p> <p>The theater was full, as well as the bar. Saturday night would prove a bit tamer with Folking Awesome, a trio of acts on the New York alt-folk country scene, and Cleaning Out the Closet a performance based on the ways people come out. </p> <p>On both nights, Covan was in attendance, if only for a little while, before bicycling to the East Village and her new apartment. \u201cI get exhausted. It happens all the time. Then I go into the theater and get revived.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Almost a decade ago I wrote that rape <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/feb/01/penal.genderissues\" title=\"\">might as well be legal</a>. I feel the same way today. In 2013-14 in England and Wales, about 16,000 rapes were recorded by police, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/12/rape-cps-police-prosecutors\" title=\"\">only a third of these cases</a> were sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. Approximately 15% of the recorded offences resulted in a charge. The actual attrition rate \u2013 meaning from reporting to conviction \u2013 is estimated at about 6%.</p> <p>One potential solution to this worrying state of affairs is to do away with jurors in sex crime trials, and appoint a specially trained judge. I am wholly in favour of our jury system, but even more in favour of ensuring that rapists and other sex offenders do not walk free. New Zealand could be the first country to <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11688199\" title=\"\">rid sex crime cases of jurors</a> if one key recommendation from a recently published report by its Law Commission is implemented. The commissioners have suggested that there is a case for having sexual violence trials decided by a judge, <a href=\"http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/our-projects/alternative-models-prosecuting-and-trying-criminal-cases?id=1270\" title=\"\">either alone or with two expert \u201clay assessors\u201d</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw one man acquitted after it was implied that the complainant was desperate for sex because her husband was impotent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why do away with one of the fundamentals of a decent justice system? Is the jury system not set up in order to better ensure fairness and justice, rather than relying on a crusty old Etonian in a wig?</p> <p>Not in rape cases. If jurors were to receive the level of training and awareness-raising necessary to challenge the deep-rooted and highly persuasive myths about rape, the jury system would be more effective in dealing with sex crimes \u2013 but this would take more than a few words from the judge at the beginning of a trial, which is how it works at the moment. In their report, the New Zealand commissioners found that rape trials feature \u201cpowerful cultural conceptions\u201d that are \u201cunique to sexual violence as a form of criminal offending\u201d and absent from, for example, a case involving a man hitting another man in the street or pub.</p> <p>I have sat through a number of rape cases over the years, and, despite <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/yjcea_1999/\" title=\"\">legislation introduced in 2001</a> that aimed to restrict the use of previous sexual history evidence unless there is a compelling reason for including it, the defence barrister will often find a way to bring it up. I saw one man acquitted after the defence suggested that the complainant was desperate for sex because her husband had become impotent in recent years. The defendant in this case had met the complainant at 2am in the back streets as she was walking home, totally sober. Almost all the other cases I heard involved the complainant being trashed as a reliable witness because she had been drinking (alcohol is the new short skirt).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jan/09/itaintrape-hastag-six-misconceptions-sexual-violence\">#ItAintRape: six common misconceptions about sexual violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Claims that the complainant is lying are all the more believable because of the disproportionate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/oct/25/penal.crime\" title=\"\">media coverage of false rape allegations</a>. Also jurors \u2013 in particular female ones \u2013 do not want to face the fact that those who commit rape include a broad cross section of men, and rarely fit the stereotype of a masked madman leaping out of a bush. Even when a judge permits expert evidence that challenges these myths, this cannot possibly compete with the bombardment of prejudice and misinformation that jurors absorb from some sections of the media on a daily basis.</p> <p>Unlike jurors, judges at least get a day or two of training in sexual offences, which includes dispelling the myths and understanding why complainants do not necessarily break down in tears during evidence. My only misgiving in wholly supporting doing away with jurors in rape cases is that it might give leverage to those who wish to abolish the jury system altogether as a way to save money.</p> <p>If we are serious about ensuring that those guilty of rape are convicted, public education of the type that will robustly challenge the lies and misinformation about rape has to be given priority. It is the public who become jurors and ultimately decide on such cases. The way that men who commit sex crimes are excused, and the women and men experiencing them are blamed, leaves me with no confidence in non-expert citizens delivering justice in rape cases.</p>",
  "<p>Once read, John Berger\u2019s To the Wedding exerts a talismanic power. Both Michael Ondaatje and Colum McCann have confessed to an almost superstitious reverence for it, such was the profundity of its impact upon them. I have reread it many, many times since stumbling across Berger\u2019s fiction some 20 years ago and, I hope, will continue to do so. A book of rare tenderness and compassion, To the Wedding is nothing short of magical in its power to rejuvenate the spirit.</p> <p>To The Wedding is a short book but a long read. Like poetry, Berger\u2019s paragraphs ask to be read slowly and reflected upon. The chorus of voices in the book come to the story\u2019s blind narrator unbidden. A seller of <em>tamata</em> \u2013 trinkets purported to bring good luck to those who wear them \u2013 he is a elliptical, laconic presence. There are no flourishes of wordsmithery here, no elaborate plot structures, no intricate character psychologies. Berger simply allows each person to speak, drawing them in words the same way a good artist would, in spare, true lines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/12/john-berger-writing-is-an-off-shoot-of-something-deeper\">John Berger: \u2018Writing is an off-shoot of something deeper\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The premise of the story is heartbreaking. A mother and father travel separately across Europe to their daughter Ninon\u2019s wedding in Italy, in the knowledge that the beautiful, vibrant 23-year-old will soon die of a terminal illness. Yet the book is not a tragedy, it is a celebration. Through an accumulation of moments in the lives of the characters, the reader is brought through their sadness. With every line, Berger builds towards an authentic transcendence.</p> <p>Ninon\u2019s father Jean makes his journey by motorbike, and Berger describes the thrilling immediacy of this mode of travel wonderfully. The passages about the Zen-like attentiveness to the moment required to ride are also instructive on how to live. \u201cEverything\u2019s a question of how you lean,\u201d Ninon recalls her father telling her:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a corner situation it\u2019s the straight that demands least energy and so our fight starts. By tipping our weight over into the bend, we shift the bike\u2019s center of gravity and this counteracts the centrifugal force and the Law of Inertia! Birds do the same thing in the air. Except that birds, Papa says, are not in the air to make journeys \u2014 it\u2019s where they live!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jean\u2019s estranged wife Zdena travels by train, and enjoys a brief but deeply affecting friendship with a fellow passenger, a connection that brings her a degree of respite from her anguish. Throughout the elliptical narrative, we also glimpse moments from Ninon\u2019s relationship with her fiance Gino: their first meeting, falling in love, the devastation caused when Ninon is diagnosed, and the acceptance and hope they find in the face of death.</p> <p>My own attachment to Berger\u2019s book stems from discovering it soon after my son was born. At that time, Jean\u2019s relationship with Ninon perfectly articulated the earthshaking appearance of paternal love. Since that first reading, I\u2019ve come to understand something else: that entering so deeply into the lives of others is a demonstration of compassion, and so of hope. As Mary Oliver\u2019s poem says, <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/features/audio/detail/75124\">The Real Prayers Are Not the Words, But the Attention That Comes First</a>. In difficult times, true hope is to be found in noticing and appreciating the details, in slowing down to let the fleeting, tiny moments of our lives unfurl and finding poetry there. To The Wedding is a book made up of these shining moments.</p>",

  "<p>John Osborne\u2019s <em>The Entertainer</em> is back, bang on cue: a play in which the nation frets about immigration (\u201cBloody Irish! Bloody Poles!\u201d cries one character) and our uncertain place in the world (\u201cPeople seem to be able to do what they like to us\u201d). What kind of a country is Britain, the play asks, what is to become of us?</p> <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/09/kenneth-branagh-rob-brydon-entertainer-garrick-theatre-ken-dodd\">Kenneth Branagh</a> production opens next week, nearly 60 years after its first appearance in 1957. Back then, the Suez crisis had administered a shock to the national psyche that would not be equalled until Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Rarely had a theatrical work been so eagerly anticipated. <em>Look Back in Anger</em> had strutted on stage at the Royal Court the previous year and declared war, not only on the establishment but on the British theatre. The French windows of the standard West End play were unceremoniously kicked in as gobby, snarky, grand-standing Jimmy Porter took centre stage to tell it like it was. Battle lines were drawn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/09/kenneth-branagh-rob-brydon-entertainer-garrick-theatre-ken-dodd\">Kenneth Branagh on The Entertainer: 'I've been bending Rob Brydon's ear about standup'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The controversy was helpful to sales. As Osborne himself so succinctly put it, the theatre is a minority art with a majority influence: the very existence of Jimmy holding forth with furious eloquence created a stir out of all proportion to the number of people who had actually seen the play. Among those who took the trouble to do so was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/olivier\">Laurence Olivier</a>, ever on the <em>qui vive</em> for something new. He was not impressed: \u201cIt\u2019s just a travesty on England,\u201d he told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/miller\">Arthur Miller</a>, whose wife, Marilyn Monroe, he was directing in <em>The Prince and the Showgirl</em>, \u201ca lot of bitter rattling on about conditions.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the theatre world was waiting to see what Osborne would write next. He was quietly developing the idea for a play in which the music hall would become a metaphor for the nation: the decline and fall of the Holborn Empire would mirror the decline and fall of the British empire. \u201cThe music hall is dying,\u201d he wrote in his author\u2019s note to the published text, \u201cand, with it, a significant part of England. Some of the heart of England has gone; something that once belonged to everyone, for this was truly a folk art.\u201d</p> <p>The play is set in one of the coastal towns that Osborne knew so well from his rep days \u2013 he wrote <em>Look Back in Anger</em> in Morecambe \u2013 and featured a warring and unhappy family whose breadwinner, the drama\u2019s central character, is a third-rate comedian, Archie Rice. At one time a star, Archie\u2019s old dad, Billy, gives voice to the playwright\u2019s aching sense of Britain\u2019s decline. Though Osborne aligned himself with the leftwing causes of his contemporaries at the Court, he was deeply, romantically, almost aggressively nostalgic for a time when life was better, when people like him felt normal and in the right. \u201cI feel sorry for you people,\u201d Billy tells his grandson. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s really like. You haven\u2019t lived, most of you. You\u2019ve never known what it was like, you\u2019re all miserable really.\u201d The representatives of the younger generation, Archie\u2019s son and daughter, angrily fight Jimmy Porter\u2019s corner, if in muted form. But Archie himself is possessed neither by nostalgia nor anger: he is and knows himself to be clapped-out, shifty, empty. \u201cWhat do I care?\u201d he sings as part of the tacky routine he performs, knowing even as he goes through the motions that the game is up and there is no place for him in the modern world. But what else can he do? The show must go on, even if no one is there to see it. The idea for Archie came to Osborne watching a comic ramping up a mediocre impression of Charles Laughton as the hunchback of Notre-Dame one afternoon at the crumbling Chelsea Palace of Varieties in London. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of heroic, suicidal nobility,\u201d he wrote, \u201cin a bad comic who goes onstage to face certain derision.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e1d03db1d85093ecc10f4c32aabfd1791e73bfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e1d03db1d85093ecc10f4c32aabfd1791e73bfd/0_0_3000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier as Archie Rice in the 1960 film adaptation of The Entertainer, directed by Tony Richardson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier as Archie Rice in the 1960 film adaptation of The Entertainer, directed by Tony Richardson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Osborne had written just about half the play when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/miller\">Miller</a> took himself, his wife and a deeply resistant Olivier to see <em>Look Back in Anger</em>. Miller was fascinated by the play. Olivier still didn\u2019t get it, second time around, so Miller was astonished to hear him say to the young author when they went backstage: \u201cEr, you\u2019re not writing anything that might have the littlest opportunity for \u2026 well \u2026 me \u2026 are you?\u201d Osborne showed Olivier the first act of <em>The Entertainer</em>. He was immediately drawn to the part, not of Archie, but of Billy, whose sentiments he shared. He swiftly changed his mind. For some while he had been looking for a way to reinvent himself: how better to smash the image of the classical actor and ageing romantic lead than by crooning and hoofing and telling off-colour jokes? He desperately wanted to be part of the latest thing, whatever it was, and if doing so meant he could steal a march on his peers \u2013 the Gielguds and the Richardsons and the Guinnesses \u2013 then so much the better. What didn\u2019t seem to interest Olivier too much was what the play was actually saying. He himself was unthinkingly conservative, God-fearing, law-abiding and patriotic. He objected to certain anti-monarchy lines, which he had cut when the play transferred to the West End, but it seems he saw it not as a state-of-England play, but as the personal tragedy of Archie Rice, with which he identified strongly. There was something of Archie in him, he told the Daily Mail. \u201cIt\u2019s what I might so easily have become.\u201d Standing in front of the footlights in his mask-like makeup at a technical rehearsal, he said to William Gaskill: \u201cIt\u2019s me, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Olivier\u2019s Archie presented mid-century Britain to itself in all its tarnished, seedy, impotent dishonesty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The production was exceptionally well cast, with due deference to the star. Billy Rice was played by George Relph, an old chum of Olivier\u2019s, a very young Richard Pasco played Archie\u2019s son, Frank, and Dorothy Tutin (Olivier\u2019s lover at the time), was cast as his daughter Jean. The Royal Court management was keen that Phoebe, Archie\u2019s neglected and rather plain wife, should be played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/vivien-leigh\">Vivien Leigh</a>, Olivier\u2019s demanding and very beautiful wife in real life; she was at the time battling with bipolar disorder. Olivier swiftly scotched the idea, even in the face of a suggestion that she could wear a rubber mask to disguise her beauty. Brenda de Banzie, who had earlier played opposite Olivier in <em>Venus Observed</em>, was duly cast in the part, but Leigh sat in on rehearsals until the unending stream of helpful comments emanating from her began to be distracting, at which she was removed. Tony Richardson, George Devine\u2019s associate at the Court, whose instincts for what would be successful were somewhat in advance of his gifts as a director, presided over all this. He staged the sprawling play efficiently enough, though he was not always able to help Osborne reconcile the opposing demands of rhetoric and form in the play, any more than he had been in <em>Look Back in Anger</em>. It was a good show, however, with witty and accurate designs by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">Alan Tagg</a> and a brilliant pastiche score by John Addison. In <em>Look Back in Anger</em> jazz is the defining music, but in <em>The Entertainer</em> it is the blues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86f751e6159018f2d0a8edc9de2a6ad8d89d3151\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86f751e6159018f2d0a8edc9de2a6ad8d89d3151/0_0_1181_952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Wall and Sue Johns in the 1974 Greenwich theatre revival of The Entertainer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"806\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Wall and Sue Johns in the 1974 Greenwich theatre revival of The Entertainer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Johns/taken from picture library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first night was unusually fraught; Osborne had been in the law courts all day, divorcing his first wife. Olivier had written to him to thank him for giving him such a wonderful part, and hoped that he didn\u2019t \u201cfuck it up for him\u201d. On the contrary: he gave what many people felt was the performance of his life. It is not given to many actors to embody the zeitgeist: Olivier\u2019s Archie presented post-Suez, mid-century Britain to itself in all its tarnished, seedy, impotent dishonesty, surgically exposing all the pain that lay behind it. He spoke for England, as he had done before, when he had played Henry V on stage. Laughton had gone backstage and asked him: \u201cYou know why you\u2019re so good in this, Larry? Do you? It\u2019s because you are England.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/29/for-baby-boomers-the-1950s-were-years-of-hope\">For baby boomers, the 1950s were years of hope | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reviews were fairly unanimous about the quality of Olivier\u2019s performance; the combination of tacky brilliance in the front cloth numbers (fruit of his close observation of comedians such as Max Miller and his hero Sid Field) and emotional nakedness in the domestic scenes was overwhelming. The play itself was less warmly received: \u201cMr Osborne has had the big and brilliant idea of putting the whole of contemporary England on one and the same stage,\u201d wrote Kenneth Tynan, \u201che has bitten off, in this broad new subject, rather more than he can maul.\u201d He added, the author seemed unable to write convincing parts for women: Jean was \u201cvaguely anti-Queen and goes in for loose generalities like \u2018We\u2019ve only got ourselves\u2019; beyond that, nada. Rather than commit himself, Mr Osborne has watered the girl down to a nullity.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Max Wall\u2019s Archie revealed the romanticism of Olivier\u2019s approach: he drew a tragicomic portrait of a soul in hell</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Great part, mediocre play: this has, with variations, remained the verdict of history. Interestingly, only two years after Tynan\u2019s influential first review he saw a production of it in Hamburg, and revised his opinion: the great actor Martin Held played Archie quite differently from Olivier, as a German cabaret MC, \u201ccruder and sweatier than Olivier, and drunker, too, in a stiff-backed, stolid way, emphasising his jokes with a ghastly, crowing laugh\u201d. The result, wrote Tynan, was that the play took on much more cogency and shape; Jean became a central figure. Such thorough-going reconsiderations of the drama have been rare; only one British actor in living memory has effaced the imprint of Olivier, and that was the great comedian (and novelty dancer) Max Wall, who played Archie in Osborne\u2019s own perhaps over-loving 1974 revival at Greenwich theatre (it lasted nearly four hours).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/nov/05/theatre\">The Entertainer, London, November 1974</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As if in a negative image, Wall reversed Olivier\u2019s conception. In the front cloth scenes, Olivier showed a 10\u2011rate performer who, despite a lack of talent, was eager to make an impact. In the private scenes, he exposed the man\u2019s despair: when he showed Jean his dead eyes, they were in fact shot through with excruciating pain. When Wall played the same scene, his eyes were unnervingly dead; during the scenes in the music hall, he presented Archie as effortlessly skilful but deeply bored, just sketching it in. He nonchalantly knocked off a few steps, full of contempt for his audience, whereas Olivier put everything he had into the dancing. Wall\u2019s performance revealed the full-blown romanticism of Olivier\u2019s approach: he drew a tragicomic portrait of a soul in hell. Wall\u2019s Archie was flatly realistic, and all the more disturbing for that. The man was a dead cinder. The performance made the play seem smaller, less epic, but in some ways better, more real, less schematic. It was less entertaining, and more disturbing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0roY4u3AFAQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0roY4u3AFAQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch a scene from the 1960 film adaptation of The Entertainer </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Such are the swings and roundabouts of theatrical production: just as Edith Evans by sheer force of talent made Lady Bracknell the focal point of <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>, unbalancing it, Olivier\u2019s Archie to some extent overwhelmed <em>The Entertainer</em>. But who would have been without that performance? Olivier was remade, and moved on to ever greater heights. Nothing in Osborne\u2019s subsequent work ever made quite such an impact, but, as he wrote to Devine: \u201cI shall go on writing plays and play my part in all the things that need so desperately to be done.

Dreyfus appealed to the administrative appeals tribunal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/22/attorney-general-must-process-labor-request-to-see-parts-of-his-diary\">and categorically won.</a> <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But in a surprise move, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/20/george-brandis-challenges-ruling-process-request-release-diary\">Brandis appealed the ruling </a></p> <p>which was made by the respected federal court judge Jayne Jagot sitting in her role as a judicial member of the tribunal. </p> <p>The case is funded by the taxpayer, with advice provided by the Australian Government Solicitors, prompting Dreyfus to accuse Brandis of wasting public funds.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is a tremendous waste of taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d Dreyfus said ahead of the appeal. \u201cSenator Brandis should have processed this request at the outset and should not have wasted tens of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money.\u201d</p> <p>Publishing diary entries is not new, and they are not Brandis\u2019s personal appointments, just government ones. The US president, Barack Obama, publishes his, as does the NSW premier, Mike Baird.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s indisputably in the public interest that the appointments made by ministers are in public,\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cThe public are entitled to know who ministers are meeting with and how often they\u2019re meeting.</p> <p>\u201cYou would think that as the minister responsible for the FOI act he would be doing his utmost to set the example.\u201d</p> <p>To add to the unusual proceedings, Dreyfus represented himself in the proceedings. The shadow attorney general is a seasoned Queen\u2019s Counsel, and also represented himself in the tribunal proceedings.</p> <p>The matter will return to the federal court at a date to be determined.</p> <p><em>Australian Associated Press also contributed to this report.</em></p>",
  "<p>Getting premises fitted out with no money in the bank was a real test of Wilf Horsfall\u2019s negotiation skills. Horsfall, co-founder of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://ubrew.cc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ubrew</a>, persuaded National Rail to give his company three months\u2019 rent free in a railway arch in Bermondsey. Then, along with his co-founder Matt Denham, he set about securing credit with various suppliers to tide the brewery over. The firm had raised \u00a3120,000 via a crowdfunding campaign but had not yet received the funds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d34824faa0660e9d24ad714b9fd836ec4163eef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d34824faa0660e9d24ad714b9fd836ec4163eef4/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"two men in beer shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Denham and Wilf Horsfall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UBrew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe had to explain that the money was coming, show them the crowdfunding page [\u2026] it was blagging, basically,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery time we needed screws or nails, we\u2019d pick up the phone and sell memberships, courses, or company away days, to buy more materials. We would get equipment for the brewery sent to us and pay half in advance, and half when we got the money.\u201d<br></p> <p>Such situations are perhaps not uncommon for small business owners. Negotiation is part of everyday life for entrepreneurs \u2013 deals with suppliers, customers, stockists and employees, all have to be done to get a new business off the ground, and enable it to grow.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many people think [negotiation] has to be confrontational. I refute that</p> <footer> <cite>Natalie Reynolds, CEO of AdvantageSpring</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a skill that Natalie Reynolds, CEO of negotiation consultancy business <a href=\"http://www.advantagespring.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">AdvantageSpring</a> and author of We Have a Deal, says does not come naturally to everyone. \u201c[There isn\u2019t] such a thing as a natural born negotiator,\u201d she says. \u201c[But] it is a skill that anyone can master.\u201d<br></p> <p>There are three broad categories of negotiation \u2013 rational, soft and hard, explains Dr Connson Locke, from the London School of Economics. Rational is very unemotional and uses logic; soft focuses on trying to make a connection with the other person; and hard is \u201cwhat you see in the movies \u2013 the aggressive, assertive, pounding on the table\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe all have a personal tendency to one of those caricatures,\u201d she says. A <a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/SBS_working_papers/Negotiation_Behaviour.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2013 study</a> (pdf) from the University of Oxford examining the negotiation behaviour of entrepreneurs, found that small business owners use persuasion and express emotion more than non-entrepreneurs. Perhaps because of this assertive behaviour, they closed fewer deals than non-entrepreneurs \u2013 but those that they did close were at a higher profit.</p> <p>Being passionate about your cause is of course an asset for small business owners, but Reynolds says that negotiation is not about the fight, but about collaboration. \u201cMany people think [negotiation] has to be confrontational. I refute that hugely. If you view negotiation through a win/lose mindset, you will often end up losing.\u201d<br></p> <p>For Horsfall, building trust with his suppliers was key to getting the deal: \u201cIt\u2019s just about creating personal relationships with people, and working with smaller suppliers who can be a bit more flexible because they are looking for business. B&amp;Q obviously don\u2019t need or have the time to do case by case credit arrangements.\u201d<br></p> <p>Negotiating with larger companies, who will often refuse to negotiate on terms, can be difficult for small business owners. Josh Turner, owner of <a href=\"http://www.stand4socks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stand4 Socks</a>, found that larger department stores pushed for very favourable terms, and often he found he was powerless to argue: \u201cWe\u2019re on sale or return for larger stores, whereas the smaller stores pay us up front [\u2026] we had to reduce our price quite a bit to give them their margin. With [a big online retailer], we did try to negotiate the price but they said if you want to be on here, we take 25% plus VAT. It was a shame, but we needed them.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"77e355bf14fe5de01528ba98377aec9353466430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77e355bf14fe5de01528ba98377aec9353466430/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"josh turner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Turner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reynolds does not buy the idea of being too big to negotiate. She argues that it is about finding more creative options. \u201cA lot of the time, people in far stronger positions like to say no because they think they hold all the cards. Your trick is to have an immediate counter suggestion [\u2026] People who are the most effective at negotiation go in with multiple options. If it\u2019s still non-negotiable, ask \u2018well, what would make it negotiable?\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>Initially, the biggest challenge for Turner was finding someone to make his socks. He wanted a small number of his 10 colourful designs \u2013 the profits from which would go to a designated charity. But he found that the minimum orders for manufacturers were extremely high and he was asked to commit to at least 2,000 pairs per design. He wanted 300 pairs. It seemed increasingly unlikely that this would be possible, until he made a deal with the owner of one of the largest factories in the world.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the third trip [to Turkey] when they took me seriously,\u201d he admits. \u201cI wore them down. I needed them way more than they needed me but we built up a strong relationship and mutual respect for each other. Even now, we\u2019ll be in a meeting and everyone else will say \u2018this is a complicated order, it\u2019s not for us\u2019, and the owner will insist \u2018Josh is a special customer, we\u2019ll help him out with this\u2019.\u201d<br></p> <p>Having a good relationship is key, particularly for entrepreneurs who are likely to make multiple deals with the same party. Locke argues that it is for this reason that high-stake negotiation should be done in person, which is becoming rarer in our technology-driven business world. \u201cNegotiation is an inter-personal skill, and for any interpersonal skill you need that connection.\u201d<br></p> <p>There is a pervading stereotype that more women embrace the softer negotiation style than men. Experts also argue that women are <a href=\"http://www.womendontask.com/questions.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">less ambitious</a> in what they ask for and are able to negotiate more effectively if they\u2019re <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2013/06/17/why-women-must-ask-the-right-way-negotiation-advice-from-stanfords-margaret-a-neale/#6cd2d55c1635\" rel=\"nofollow\">doing it on behalf of another person</a>, rather than themselves. Reynolds says we need to challenge those assumptions and biases: \u201cSome of the toughest negotiators I\u2019ve met have been women, and some of the most timid and fearful negotiators have been men. Everyone is different.\u201d<br></p> <p>Annie Ridout, founder of <a href=\"http://theearlyhour.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Early Hour</a>, an online culture and lifestyle magazine, says that a course with the Prince\u2019s Trust and surrounding herself with strong female role models, in life and at work, helped her feel more confident about negotiation. She mentions one friend in particular who \u201calways asks for more money than employers are offering her\u201d. She adds: \u201cBeing around empowered women and hearing about them negotiating effectively, and succeeding, made me feel like I could do it too.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2fa75b96075acbfb338969dc78c6af56befb57c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fa75b96075acbfb338969dc78c6af56befb57c8/0_213_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"anne ridout\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annie Ridout.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It helped Ridout when negotiating prices of sponsored posts. \u201cOne person came in at \u00a350 and I got them up to \u00a3250 in the end,\u201d she says, adding that she explained the value of the audience and the extra support she\u2019d include to boost the package. Her move worked. \u201cThey were really receptive, surprisingly so. I think it would be really easy to stop low and to be scared about asking for more money. But actually, just being a bit bold and confident about what you have to offer [is key].\u201d<br></p> <p>For those that do feel anxious about the prospect of negotiation, Reynolds recommends the DEALS method as a guide to each stage.</p> <ul> <li>Discover: Do your research beforehand. Discover everything about the issue that is going to be negotiated, and consider the other party\u2019s perspective as well. What do they want to achieve? </li> <li>Establish: Set some boundaries. Know how far you can you go on every issue. Write this down so that you won\u2019t agree to something you\u2019ll regret in the heat of the moment.</li> <li>Ask: When you are ready to make a proposal, do it in the right way. Give yourself some wriggle room, and plan your options in advance. Ask them questions about their position too. </li> <li>Lead: Rather than being overly aggressive, Reynolds says that leading is about being in control of yourself, having discipline, and being clear about what you ask for. </li> <li>Seal: Negotiation doesn\u2019t end at the handshake. Get the deal in writing as soon as possible and plan for failure now. Add a clause about what the process will be if there are issues \u2013 it is harder to negotiate this when you\u2019re in the middle of it. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

  "<h2><strong>Elephant evolution</strong></h2> <p>The largest of all land beasts, elephants are thundering, trumpeting six-tonne monuments to the wonder of evolution. From the tip of that distinctive trunk with its 100,000 dextrous muscles; to their outsize ears that flap the heat away; to the <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129500.900-pachyderm-politics-and-the-powerful-female/?full=true#.Us8ahf22Q4M\">complex matriarchal societies</a> and the <a href=\"http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=animsent\">mourning of their dead</a>; to the points of their ivory tusks, designed to defend, but ultimately the cause of their ruin.<br></p> <p>African and Asian elephants are more closely related to the woolly mammoth than to each other. The ears are said to be a geographical guide. In Asia, elephants have smaller India-shaped ears. While in Africa their huge ears are the shape of the whole continent. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/why-the-guardian-is-spending-a-year-reporting-on-the-plight-of-the-worlds-elephant-population\">Why the Guardian is spending a year reporting on the plight of the world's elephant population</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Where do they live? </strong></h2> <p>Asian elephants used to roam from the coast of Persia through India and southeast Asia and deep into China. In Africa, they could be found in almost every habitat from the shores of the Mediterranean to the Cape of Good Hope. Most common in the savannahs, elephants still inhabit a wide variety of landscapes. They can be found in the Saharan and Namibian deserts and the rainforests of Rwanda and Borneo. But their range has shrunk and they are now extinct in the Middle East, on the Indonesian island of Java, northern Africa and most of China. Almost everywhere, these great nomads are restricted to ever-decreasing pockets of land.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fdbd5ebc95adfc0660451845d68717d5cabfc7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fdbd5ebc95adfc0660451845d68717d5cabfc7b/0_148_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephants in Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephants in Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: THE DSWT / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How many elephants are alive around the world?</h2> <p>In 1800 there may have been 26 million elephants in Africa alone, although it\u2019s hard to be precise.

Tiny populations, a few hundreds or thousands, cling on in countries across south-east Asia and the Himalayas. </p> <p>In Africa, the larger of the two species is a step further from extinction. Less than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/24/african-elephants-could-be-extinct-in-wild-within-decades-say-experts\">half a million roam the continent</a>, mostly in the southern states. In the west and the forested centre, elephants are in a particularly perilous condition.</p> <h2><strong>What has caused the destruction of elephants?</strong></h2> <p>For thousands of years ivory has been prized and elephants have been killed for it. The Egyptian pharoah Tutankhamun was laid to rest around 1323BC on a headrest of ivory, while in nearby Syria elephants were more or less wiped out for their ivory by 500BC. </p> <p>The invention of guns increased the pressure. The 19th century brought a fashion for big game hunting among colonialists, which wiped out herds across the continent of Africa. Now the remaining dwindling numbers face the threat of local hunters and modern poaching gangs, financed by Asian syndicates and armed by the conflicts of Africa.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/elephants-are-the-end-of-a-60-million-year-lineage-the-last-of-the-megaherbivores\">Elephants are the end of a 60 million year lineage \u2013 the last of the megaherbivores</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some experts see the brutal killings of elephants not as a battle for a commodity, but for land. As the human population booms, so does demand for space. Poaching conveniently removes elephants from the land, leaving it open to development. This is a pattern seen across western Africa, where elephant declines have been most precipitous. By 2050, 63% of remaining elephant rangelands <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/sites/default/files/common/resources/pub/Elephants_in_the_dust.pdf\">will be compromised</a> (pdf) by human encroachment.</p> <p>The tightly-contested rural landscapes of Asia have seen a more direct form of conflict between humans and elephants. In an evening\u2019s feeding a herd of elephants can destroy the annual crop of many small farmers. Human lives are also in danger. In India, panicked or enraged elephants kill <a href=\"http://www.moef.nic.in/downloads/public-information/ETF_REPORT_FINAL.pdf\">more than 400 people each year</a> (pdf). This leads to retaliation. Wildlife authorities often hunt down and kill problem elephants. In Indonesia, <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/elephants/human_elephant_conflict.cfm\">dozens of elephants are poisoned</a> by palm oil growers each year.</p> <h2><strong>Uncovering the \u2018elephant holocaust\u2019</strong></h2> <p>As Africa\u2019s nations shook off colonial rule in the years following World War II, a huge poaching crisis arose. British zoologist Ian Douglas Hamilton, who flew a light aircraft over sub-Saharan African countries to count elephants in the 1970s and 80s, uncovered what became known as the \u201celephant holocaust\u201d. He estimated that African elephant numbers fell from one million to 400,000 during the 1980s. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/african-zip/giv-31075WSwAfLYQv9GT/\" data-alt=\"Current range of African elephants\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/african-zip/giv-31075WSwAfLYQv9GT/\">Current range of African elephants</a> <figcaption>Current range of African elephants</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without the often dangerous work of Hamilton, governments would not have come together to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/17/science/ivory-trade-is-banned-to-save-the-elephant.html\">ban the international trade in ivory in 1989</a>. This led to a recovery in elephant numbers until 2008, when infiltration of the ivory trade by criminal gangs, rising Asian demand and high levels of corruption increased the levels of poaching with catastrophic results.</p> <h2><strong>How many elephants are killed a year for ivory? </strong></h2> <p>Around 20,000 African elephants were killed last year for their tusks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/03/african-elephants-killed-faster-than-they-are-being-born\">more than were born</a>. Chinese wealth is financing a hunger for ivory that threatens to bring an end to wild elephants within our lifetime. </p> <p>There has never been a more dangerous time to be an elephant. Not during the industrial pillaging of the colonial era, nor the chaotic African and Asian independence movements that sparked a 1970s poaching boom, has an elephant been more likely to fall to a gun.</p> <p>In spite of the global ban on international trade (overseen by the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/\">Cites</a>) the illegal ivory trade has exploded. <a href=\"http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/stiles/\">Some believe</a> large amounts of ivory has also been bought and stored in secret warehouses by investors needing somewhere to hide money from the global downturn. Criminal gangs bribe officials to ship huge quantities of ivory through the ports to illicit factories and markets of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand in particular. In 2011, <a href=\"http://www.asianscientist.com/2012/01/topnews/malaysia-customs-ivory-traffic-southeast-asia-012012/\">seizures hit a peak of 23 metric tonnes</a> \u2013 2,500 elephants. But that is only a fraction of what makes it through undisturbed.</p> <h2>What should we do with ivory stockpiles?</h2> <p>Some African states - including Namibia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana - are arguing for the right to sell off their ever-growing stockpiles, fed by both seizures and natural deaths, in order to help fund conservation work. <br></p> <p>But ivory sell-offs - such as the two in 1999 and 2008 - have been also criticised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/legal-ivory-sale-drove-dramatic-increase-in-elephant-poaching-study-shows\">for increasing demand</a>, although there are some <a href=\"http://www.fmunderwood.com/2016/06/20/critique-of-hsiang-and-sekar-paper-linking-legal-ivory-sale-to-an-increase-in-illegal-killing-of-elephants/\">who dispute these findings</a>. Another sale has been mooted by Zimbabwe and Namibia and will be discussed at Cites\u2019 triennial conference this September. Many states have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/06/does-destroying-ivory-save-elephants\">burned their stockpiles</a> for symbolic and practical reasons.</p> <h2><strong>Is it still legal to sell ivory?</strong></h2> <p>In many countries ivory can be sold legally, usually sourced from stockpiles or from elephants killed before the ban, allowing antiques to be traded. <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/2002/021004_ivory.shtml\">Cites has raised concerns</a> that unregulated domestic markets in China, Japan, Myanmar and Vietnam allow freshly killed ivory to join legal stock on the shelves, fuelling the poaching crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-11T11:14:41/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Over 41 tonnes of ivory was seized in China during the period 2012 to 2014\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-11T11:14:41/embed.html\">Over 41 tonnes of ivory was seized in China during the period 2012 to 2014</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>What can we do to halt the decline?</strong></h2> <h2><strong>1) Protect habitat</strong></h2> <p>Efforts to protect Asian elephants focus immense pressure on land and habitat. Poaching exists on the continent, but it is a lesser threat compared to the destruction of their homes. Unlike their African cousins, only Asian bull elephants have tusks. Elephant protection relies on the defence of reserve land from legal and illegal encroachment, logging, roads and other developments. Innovative solutions can help, such as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/indian-conservationist-wins-whitley-award-for-saving-elephants-via-sms\">project in the tea fields of India</a> which uses an SMS warning system so that humans can coexist safely with elephants. </p> <h2><strong>2) Reduce demand</strong></h2> <p>In the markets of Asia where the majority of the poached African ivory ends up, the holy grail of elephant conservation remains the abolition of demand for ivory. This has worked in Japan \u2013 what was one of the biggest markets for ivory at the turn of this century is now a minor player. </p> <p>In China, <a href=\"http://wildaid.org/news/yao-ming-urges-china-%E2%80%98say-no-ivory-and-rhino-horn%E2%80%99-new-film\">advertising campaigns featuring local and foreign celebrities</a> are having an effect. The proportion of Chinese who believe elephant poaching is a problem <a href=\"http://wildaid.org/news/consumer-awareness-ivory-and-rhino-horn-trade%E2%80%99s-impact-grows-rapidly-china\">grew from 47% to 71%</a> between 2012 and 2014. This awareness also appears to be having an effect on policy. The Chinese and US governments have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/26/china-and-us-agree-on-ivory-ban-in-bid-to-end-illegal-trade-globally\">agreed to work together to end the global illegal ivory trade</a>. Last year, China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/29/china-agrees-to-phase-out-its-ivory-industry-to-combat-elephant-poaching\">began to phase out</a> its domestic manufacture and sale of ivory and the US cracked down on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/us-adopts-near-total-ban-on-commercial-ivory-trade\">its own internal market</a>, which was the second largest in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c154ab80ddec96a0a85cb91b91221151fc0a07d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c154ab80ddec96a0a85cb91b91221151fc0a07d2/0_192_5756_3453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seized ivory products in China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seized ivory products in China</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile the Europeans \u2013 historically responsible for a great part of the decline of elephants during colonial-era craze for big game hunting \u2013 have drawn criticism for refusing to back a long-term end to all trade in ivory. Some observers argue that the only way to save elephants is to give them economic value. That can mean emphasising the <a href=\"http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/10/17/report-estimates-enormous-economic-value-of-living-elephants/\">value to tourism</a>, but the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-437-EN-F1-1-ANNEX-2.PDF\">EU has raised</a> the possibility of allowing states where populations are stable to harvest ivory and sell it to China legally.</p> <h2>3) Support the frontline defenders</h2> <p>The link between poaching and poverty is clear: rates of infant mortality and poaching activity correlate <a href=\"https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/african_elephant_summit_background_document_2013_en.pdf\">strongly</a>. In Kenya, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/30/kenya-poaching-elephant-ivory-rhino-horn-future-communities\">a poacher makes $3 per kilo of ivory</a>, a princely sum compared to the daily earnings of many around them. But the gangs they sell it to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/08/ivory-price-drop-in-china-signals-fall-in-demand-report-says\">get $1,100 per kilo</a> for the same tusk in China. Many elephants, particularly in the forests of central Africa, are not only targeted for their ivory. An enterprising hunter can <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/edocs/ssc-op-045.pdf\">make more</a> (pdf) money in the unregulated bushmeat markets from the smoked meat than from the tusks. So the development and prosperity of rural Africa is a vital aspect of elephant conservation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d57262a57351394311335531c91a9532c453d74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d57262a57351394311335531c91a9532c453d74/0_508_5171_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers carry elephant tusks to a burning site for a historic destruction of illegal ivory and rhino-horn confiscated mostly from poachers in Nairobi\u2019s national park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers carry elephant tusks to a burning site for a historic destruction of illegal ivory and rhino-horn confiscated mostly from poachers in Nairobi\u2019s national park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the face of this multitude of threats, inspirational work is being done by exceptionally brave people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/30/kenya-poaching-elephant-ivory-rhino-horn-future-communities\">In Kenya, former poachers are recruited</a> to be the world\u2019s first line of defence against the murder of elephants \u2013 the park rangers.

Nadal, who won gold in Beijing, missed London - and almost missed Rio. The whippy left wrist that has been is six-gun all his career finally ran out of bullets at Roland Garros nearly 10 weeks ago, and not many expected him to make this gig. He led Spain in at the opening ceremony and who could doubt his commitment to the cause after entering the three disciplines? Unfortunately, the wretched intrusion of rain on Wednesday has forced fixtures pile-up that demands he play three matches on Thursday. He got the first out of the way with a bit of a struggle, taking just over two hours to get rid of the always combative Frenchman, Gilles Simon. The wrist looked strong.

After interminably refreshing the Olympic tickets page, I managed to get some early morning hockey tickets - with the added bonus of being able to stay in the Olympic Park for the full Saturday watching on the big screens. I also booked an evening slot to go up the Orbit tower, as a fun way to round off the day. I was totally unaware that you can see down into the stadium from the viewing platform, or that our slot coincided with Mo Farah going for gold. Only half the track was visible from where we were, so as the athletes disappeared down the back straight every lap we could only listen to the incredible noise coming from the stadium and cross our fingers! Even from several hundred metres away, the sound was thunderous. I can\u2019t imagine the atmosphere inside the stadium, but it was quite a special shared experience between the handful of us crowded onto that platform, as Mo came into view and stormed down the home straight to victory.\u201d</p> <p>For mine? I blagged into the photographers area - i.e. the best seats in the house. Then did it again for the 100m final a couple nights later. Probably would have been punted from my then-LOCOG job if caught.

  "<p>Large-scale seizures of ivory in Singapore over the last three years make the south-east Asian city-state one of the world\u2019s premier ivory smuggling hubs for organised crime, say conservation watchdogs. <br></p> <p>Data from seizures, collected by the UN\u2019s wildlife trade monitor Traffic and the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and shared with the Guardian, reveals how the gangsters operate. Shipping containers carrying thousands of tusks are labelled as carrying anything from tea to waste paper or avocados. They leave Africa from a few ports well-known for high levels of corruption.</p> <p>Customs officials in China and Hong Kong \u2013 where most ivory ends up \u2013 target containers which have come from those ports. In order to get around this, according to EIA director of campaigns Julian Newman and traffic wildlife trade expert Tom Milliken, ivory shipments are being dropped off in transit ports, such as Singapore or Port Klang in Malaysia, where they can sit for months before being loaded on to a new vessel with paperwork listing a new port of origin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-11T11:14:41/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Over 41 tonnes of ivory was seized in China during the period 2012 to 2014\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-11T11:14:41/embed.html\">Over 41 tonnes of ivory was seized in China during the period 2012 to 2014</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019d probably get a red flag if you were shipping dried fish from Africa to Hong Kong,\u201d said Newman. \u201cBut if it came from Malaysia then it wouldn\u2019t. There\u2019s lots of loopholes that people are able to exploit to try and get their stuff through customs control.\u201d</p> <p>Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia are the transit countries traditionally favoured by the gangs. Between 2010 and today, the EIA recorded these countries seizing a total of 32, 18 and 14 tonnes of ivory respectively.</p> <p>By comparison, there had been relatively few seizures in Singapore for more than a decade before 2013. Since then, authorities have made four large seizures of 1.8 tonnes, 1 tonne, 3.7 tonnes and 0.5 tonnes \u2013 all of which Singapore <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2016/06/singapore-crushes-illegal-ivory-worth-10-million/\">crushed</a> in a display of defiance against the trade.</p> <p>The speed at which the syndicates have established themselves in the city-state has caught the attention of wildlife trade experts such as Milliken. \u201cSingapore literally came out of nowhere and became a country of primary concern. It\u2019s not a lot of seizures but the ones that occurred were a large volume of ivory,\u201d he said. Amounts of half a tonne and above indicate the involvement of criminal gangs.</p> <p>Organised crime is a key threat to elephant survival, said Milliken, because of the huge volumes they are able to ship at once. The payoffs are huge and the consequences usually minimal. Traffic estimates that more than 95% of illegal shipments evade officials. Arrests are rare. As a result elephant poaching in Africa has exploded since 2008 with catastrophic results in countries such as Tanzania where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/tanzania-epicentre-of-elephant-poaching-census-reveals\">population dropped 60% from 2009 to 2014</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 95% of illegal shipments evade officials and arrests are rare</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Milliken has prepared <a href=\"https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/17/WorkingDocs/E-CoP17-57-06-R1.pdf\">a report</a> (pdf) for next month\u2019s critical wildlife summit \u2013 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) conference in South Africa \u2013 in which he names Singapore as \u201ca country of primary concern\u201d. The conference will consider whether to put Singapore on a list of worst offending countries that are required to submit a plan for controlling the trade and overseen by their peers. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the Singaporean Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority said the agency was reviewing the recommendation made to Cites and that Singapore used \u201ca multi-pronged approach to weed out illegal wildlife trade\u201d. They would not comment on the apparent renewed presence of criminal gangs.</p> <p>In June, when the country crushed its seized ivory, <a href=\"https://www.ava.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/press-release_singapore-crushed-7-9-tonnes-of-seized-ivory.pdf\">senior minister of state for national development and home affairs Desmond Lee said</a> (pdf): \u201cTackling this illicit trade requires close international cooperation, and also the assistance of the public and NGOs. We will continue our enforcement efforts, to prevent Singapore from being used as a transit point.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-11T11:16:33/embed.html\" data-alt=\"High proportions of ivory in large scale seizures indicates the involvement of organised crime\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-11T11:16:33/embed.html\">High proportions of ivory in large scale seizures indicates the involvement of organised crime</a> </figure>  <p>The Cites conference of parties (CoP) is the major global meeting on the wildlife trade. It occurs every three years, this year in Johannesburg. On the agenda are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/09/the-eu-is-right-to-oppose-a-global-ivory-ban\">controversial proposals</a> to allow some sales of ivory by some African countries. The international trade in ivory was banned by Cites in 1989.</p> <p>Like most aspects of the ivory trade, global data on seizures varies in quality from country to country. Traffic and the EIA maintain databases of seizures using police records, tips, leaks and media announcements.</p> <p>This is not the first time that ivory gangs have operated in Singapore. In 2002 a tip off to the EIA led to one of the <a href=\"https://eia-international.org/wp-content/uploads/Back-in-Business-2002.pdf\">biggest ivory seizures of all time</a> (pdf) \u2013 6.2 tonnes. The only person arrested was Toh Yew Lye, a middleman who had signed the port documents in Singapore (he claimed to believe the shipments were sculptures). Documents captured in Africa suggested the syndicate had made as many as 18 shipments from Malawi between 1994 and 2002. Lye was fined just $3,000. But the crime itself was worth millions of dollars. One of the most lucrative smuggling routes of the 1990s was broken and Singapore remained quiet for a decade. </p> <p>Milliken believes the return of at least one smuggling ring to the world\u2019s second busiest port could be motivated by increasing pressure on the trade in Malaysia. At the last Cites CoP in 2013, Malaysia was named a country of primary concern and forced to submit a national ivory plan. While Malaysia remains a premier smuggling route, the humiliation has led to some progress, according to Milliken, which may have pushed the criminals back to Singapore.</p> <p>\u201cIf law enforcement gets tough in one place then of course the people behind these consignments will find another way. They are constantly looking for the path of least resistance,\u201d he said. Newman calls this interpretation \u201ccredible\u201d.</p> <p>In Hong Kong and China, ivory has taken on an increased level of political importance. The Chinese government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/29/china-agrees-to-phase-out-its-ivory-industry-to-combat-elephant-poaching\">announced last year</a>it would phase out the country\u2019s domestic ivory trade. As such, highly sophisticated systems have been developed to target shipments that fit certain profiles. </p> <p>Thirty million containers pass through Singapore\u2019s port every year. It is this volume that makes it attractive to gangs and a nightmare for customs trying to combat the illegal passage of everything from pangolins to rocket launchers.</p> <p>\u201cMost of their targeting and profiling, probably number one is looking for drugs and then perhaps armaments. Wildlife trade, ivory, it\u2019s probably somewhere there but it\u2019s certainly not a mega priority,\u201d said Milliken.</p>",
  "<p>When I walked into a classroom to deliver my first lecture, early in 2014, I was terrified. Not long out of undergraduate studies myself, I felt like an imposter.

Standing in front of a room of students began to feel normal.</p> <p>But our mandatory student feedback surveys are crushing that confidence. They report that I seem \u201cinexperienced\u201d and the block that I teach is \u201cuninteresting\u201d. </p> <p>The point about inexperience is accurate, of course; some of the staff I teach alongside have taught for 20 years, while I have taught for 20 hours (over two and a half years of PhD research). What\u2019s more, those 20 hours have been passed my way in bits and pieces, spread across numerous courses and year groups, meaning that I rarely have long enough to learn student names or get used to a group dynamic. In terms of content, I have little control over what I teach and I am often called upon at the last minute, with little time to prepare.</p> <p>I have always jumped at the opportunity to gain teaching experience. I know that it is essential if I am to secure an academic post after my PhD \u2013 otherwise I am unlikely to be even considered for roles that involve teaching. I also relish the opportunity to share my knowledge and enthusiasm for my subject.

I often teach on courses taught by up to five members of staff: each tutor teaches a segment of the course, which are all linked by a common theme. But the student feedback surveys do not take this fragmented structure into account.

  "<p>With Theresa May donning her walking boots and heading for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/11/theresa-may-picks-neutral-switzerland-for-summer-holiday\" title=\"\">Switzerland</a>, we have reached the breathing space that British politics has craved ever since the EU referendum. But we should enjoy it while we can, because it will be short. As soon as May returns from the Alps, speculation about an early general election, already widespread, will accelerate.</p> <p>This chatter will be irrepressible. But in my opinion it will all be wasted energy. It is absolutely not May\u2019s style to&#xa0;be looking for an early general election so soon after taking office. Her&#xa0;instincts, on this as on other matters&#xa0;of governance, are impeccably traditional. She believes the Conservative party won a mandate in May 2015, which she has inherited from David Cameron. She is personally untroubled by tabloid talk of needing to win her own mandate. Purists will say she is absolutely right about&#xa0;that.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, May is on the record as having said there would be no snap election under her leadership anyway. She said it on 30 June at the Royal United Service Institute <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-tory-leadership-bid-with-pledge-to-unite-country\" title=\"\">in the speech that launched her bid to succeed Cameron</a>. It\u2019s there in black and white. She said it because she meant it, and in part because the markets needed to hear her say it so soon after the Brexit vote. Anyone who thinks that May is the kind of politician who says something so important without meaning it underestimates her, as many do.</p> <p>Nevertheless, May cannot wholly ignore the political and journalistic culture that she currently commands. Already, in the early weeks, there has been plenty of speculation about an early election, including yesterday in the Times by the no longer quite as influential as he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timmontgomerie\" title=\"\">Tim Montgomerie</a>. Labour\u2019s leadership contest has partly been triggered by the fear of just such a&#xa0;snap poll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f7c616108748942d44a11957953191e8bc7ecf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f7c616108748942d44a11957953191e8bc7ecf7/702_33_1061_637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harold Wilson in 1970, the year he called an early general election \u2013 and lost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harold Wilson in 1970, the year he called an early general election \u2013 and lost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That talk is going to grow louder this autumn. Unless May utterly quashes the speculation, it will be the rumbling descant to the Tory conference in Birmingham in October.</p> <p>True, that speculation will mainly come from the press, many of whom still don\u2019t get it about May. The idea that&#xa0;a prime minister who takes over in mid-term is somehow illegitimate without a fresh mandate is a recent media conceit. It exemplifies a culture in which the media force politicians to jump through hoops. May, who is attractively disdainful about the media, will not be too troubled by that.</p> <p>Her backbenchers are another matter. Politicians rarely go for long without thinking about re-election. And a lot of&#xa0;Tory backbenchers are excited by the prospect of increasing the majority. The idea of hitting Labour while they are down, of seeing off Ukip before they&#xa0;can regroup, and of giving themselves more Brexit breathing space before having to go back to the voters is&#xa0;inevitably&#xa0;attractive.</p> <p>If the Tory opinion poll lead over Labour holds up at its recent double-digit level into the autumn \u2013 and this week\u2019s polls offer <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9746\" title=\"\">conflicting evidence on that</a> \u2013 election fever will increase. Pollsters will start asking about an early&#xa0;poll, Tory politicians will start being quizzed about one, and despairing Labour MPs may even start pleading for one, in the hope that Jeremy Corbyn would finally have to quit in the&#xa0;aftermath.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-tory-leadership-bid-with-pledge-to-unite-country\">Theresa May launches Tory leadership bid with pledge to unite country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are, though, three immensely powerful reasons, in addition to May\u2019s own instincts, for caution. The first is that an early election is unnecessary. Prime ministers call elections either because they lack a majority, or because they have used up their legislative energy, or because they face a defining crisis. None of these conditions applies today; <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/\" title=\"\">May has a majority of 17</a>, there are more than three full parliamentary sessions still to run, and the Tories could not currently face less of a challenge than they do from Labour.</p> <p>The second is that the public dislike early elections. Voters take their responsibility seriously. They also seem to have a collective inner sense of whether an election is appropriate or not. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwAhWeb3-RY\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson in 1970</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-general-election-february-1974\" title=\"\">Ted Heath in 1974</a> both fell foul of that instinct, defeated in part because voters thought they were being called to the ballot boxes prematurely and for opportunistic reasons. Gordon Brown, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7031749.stm\" title=\"\">if he had called an election in 2007</a>, might well have discovered the same thing. An election this autumn or next spring would be even more premature and opportunistic.</p> <p>Which leaves the final, and most insurmountable objection of all: that the law effectively prevents it. Under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Fixed-term Parliaments Act</a> 2011, the prime minister no longer has the power to call a general election off his or her own bat. If May wanted to call an early election she would therefore face daunting parliamentary and political hurdles before she could do so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Voters know when an election is appropriate. Harold Wilson and Ted Heath both fell foul of that instinct</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To comply with the act, she would have to ensure&#xa0;that two-thirds of MPs, 433 of the current 650, supported her. Even supposing that all 330 Tories did so, she would still need Labour votes. Yet why should Labour MPs become willing martyrs in an election that by definition the Tories thought they would win&#xa0;handsomely?</p> <p>The only alternative allowed by the act is for the government to contrive to lose a vote of confidence, confident in the knowledge that 330 Tories could then prevent another party forming an administration. That sort of Westminster game would be a hard sell to an electorate that already heartily disdains&#xa0;the political class.</p> <p>That leaves two options: first, simply repealing the 2011 act, which some constitutional specialists think would not restore the power to call an election to the prime minister anyway; or, second, passing a bill specifying that the next election will take place on such-and-such a date, in spite of the provisions of the 2011 act. Ideally, the act should indeed be repealed. But May\u2019s current honeymoon would struggle to survive the legislative shenanigans that such an effort would inevitably involve.</p> <p>So it could hardly be plainer. There&#xa0;isn\u2019t going to be an early election. Theresa May should say again, categorically, that there will not be. She would have been wise to say this before she headed for the hills. But she should say&#xa0;it as soon as she comes back to London at the end of the month.</p>",

They are not historical, and date up to October 2015, well beyond the scope of successive Australian government inquiries into much earlier allegations.</p> <p>By way of example of the seriousness of incidents, there were 156 reports of threatened self-harm involving children. There were 59 reports of assault on a minor, and 170 reports of \u201cconcern for a minor\u201d \u2013 which includes everything from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive#incident=sca141033\">an uneven floor that might cause people to trip</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive#incident=sca140048\">alleged sexual assault</a> and <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/nu-files/pdf/sca141120.pdf\">self-harm</a>.</p> <p>There are more than just those though. Mis-categorisation incidents is also a theme throughout the data \u2013 and we know that serious events are also simply not reported on Nauru \u2013 so even these counts are likely to be a conservative estimate. </p> <p>Even the less serious events contribute to a stressful environment of surveillance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/nauru-teachers-speak-out-for-children-we-dont-have-to-torture-them\">say former teachers who worked on the island.</a> Sometimes caseworkers will document an incident that could be considered less severe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/from-pleas-to-threats-to-harm-files-reveal-escalation-of-trauma-on-nauru\">because they know that incidents can quickly escalate to self harms or other forms of serious incidents,</a> as the length of detention of asylum seekers steadily increases.</p> <h2><strong>The seriousness of incidents disclosed in the Nauru files</strong></h2> <p>Dutton: <em>Well, out of the 2,000 as I understand it, those analysed so far ... over 20 are critical, so you\u2019re talking about where there\u2019s been an allegation of sexual assault, so that might be a person within the regional processing centre that\u2019s alleged to have assaulted a female or male within the centre.</em></p> <p>Dutton\u2019s comments vastly underestimate of the seriousness of incidents. The security company Wilson Security <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/nauru-files-show-wilson-security-staff-regularly-downgraded-reports-of-abuse\">has regularly downgraded the seriousness of incident reports on the island</a>, among four descending categories of critical, major, minor and information. So a report of self-harm that should be critical could be downgraded to major. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/20/the-worst-ive-seen-trauma-expert-lifts-lid-on-atrocity-of-australias-detention-regime\">Psychologist and traumatologist Paul Stevenson</a>, who visited Nauru 12 times to counsel and support Wilson guards, said reports were regularly downgraded and there was a constant financial pressure to de-escalate the reported severity of fights or acts of self-harm.</p> <p>As a consequence of this dubious record-keeping there are far more reports of sexual assault and child abuse than Dutton has claimed.</p> <h2><strong>Australia\u2019s role on Nauru</strong></h2> <p>Dutton: <em>\u201cWe will work with the Nauruan authorities and police force to provide support to those people [who make allegations of abuse] ... Nauru is not part of Australia, so this is an issue for the Nauruan government.\u201d</em></p> <p>This perennial myth peddled by the Australian government doesn\u2019t stack up with a vast body of legal opinion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/03/high-court-upholds-australias-right-to-detain-asylum-seekers-offshore\">including from the high court of Australia</a> and the Australian Senate. Australia established the Nauru detention centre and maintains effective control over its operations. Serious allegations that occur at the centre are a matter for Australia both as a matter of domestic and international law.</p> <h2><strong>Investigating allegations of sexual abuse or assaults</strong></h2> <p>Dutton:<em> We\u2019ve been adamant we want to treat people rightly, we will investigate. I\u2019ve been clear from day one I won\u2019t tolerate one incidence of sexual abuse or any abuse, whether it\u2019s towards a child, female, or male, on Nauru, in Manus.</em></p> <p>Many concerns have been raised about the capacity of the Nauruan police force to investigate allegations of abuse and sexual assault. The internal investigations of the companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/09/asylum-seekers-abused-on-nauru-may-never-get-justice-says-former-adviser\">on the island has also been criticised</a>, because they essentially involve organisations investigating their own staff over allegations of assaults. As a consequence, there is doubt over the effectiveness of the investigating processes set up on Nauru in the absence of other independent oversight.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear whether many of the allegations contained in the Nauru files have ever been appropriately dealt with. The reporting of serious allegations is flawed, and incidents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/nauru-files-show-wilson-security-staff-regularly-downgraded-reports-of-abuse\">are regularly downgraded in seriousness</a>. While the details of a number of cases of child abuse and sexual assault were put forward to the Australian parliament during a Senate inquiry in 2015, the Guardian\u2019s analysis has shown that a number of reports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/11/nauru-files-reveal-cases-of-alleged-sexual-violence-and-child-abuse-not-disclosed-to-parliament\">contained in the Nauru files were not disclosed.<br></a></p> <p>While Dutton says he won\u2019t tolerate a single incident of sexual abuse, the Nauru files show that allegations continued to be levelled right up to the most recent reports published by the Guardian.</p>",
  "<p>Team USA\u2019s Simone Manuel and 16-year-old Canadian Penny Oleksiak have spoiled the party for Australia\u2019s Campbell sisters in a dramatic final of the women\u2019s 100m freestyle. </p> <p>The duo overhauled a fast-starting Cate Campbell to claim gold in a dead heat, both finishing in an Olympic record time of 52.70 seconds. It was only the second dead heat for gold in Olympic swimming history, pushing the Australian sisters out of medal contention. Earlier in the night Mitch Larkin claimed silver for Australia in the men\u2019s 200m backstroke.</p> <p>The Campbell sisters had joked before the event that their dream scenario would be to dead heat for gold themselves, but neither could have expected the stunning result that eventuated as Manuel and Oleksiak finished fast to overhaul the field. Bronte Campbell entered the race as the reigning world champion and Cate the world record holder, but they were denied Olympic glory in a mad scramble in the final 15m.</p> <p>\u201cThat hurt, not as much as it\u2019s hurting right now,\u201d Cate Campbell said of the punishing finish to the race. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that I didn\u2019t need a gold medal to have self-worth and I guess that that\u2019s being put to the test at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Sister Bronte stepped in with a philosophical take on the combined sense of disappointment. \u201cI said to my coach before I even left \u2018I\u2019ve already won, I get to swim in an Olympic final with my sister.\u2019 There\u2019s not much more you can ask for than that,\u201d she said. \u201cI left it all out there. The Olympics is all about ... It\u2019s not about winning, it\u2019s about trying to win. I have no regrets. Obviously you want the result to be different but in terms of the fact that we both just laid everything that we had out there, I don\u2019t think that either of us have anything to be ashamed of.\u201d</p> <p>Bronte Campbell finished fourth in 53.04 and Cate sixth in 53.24 after she\u2019d led the race at the turn. Cate Campbell was sluggish off the blocks but streaked to an early lead and hit the turn well in front of world record pace, 0.27 seconds in front of Bronte. But it wasn\u2019t enough.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/jessica-fox-wins-bronze-in-k1-canoe-as-australian-men-claim-rowing-silver\">Jessica Fox wins bronze in K1 canoe as Australian men claim rowing silver</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cate Campbell had qualified fastest for the event with a time of 52.71, while Bronte was fifth fastest in 53.29, behind in-form Canadian Penny Oleksiak (52.72) and American Simone Manuel (53.11). Pulling off a one-two double was always going to be a tough ask for the Australians.</p> <p>In the men\u2019s 200m backstroke final, Australian Mitch Larkin overcame the disappointment in his 100m swim to take the silver medal in his pet event. The Queenslander started well to lead by 0.26 seconds at the first turn but by the 150m mark he\u2019d been overtaken by Ryan Murphy, and despite a strong finish by Larkin the American claimed the 100m/200m double in 1:53.62 to edge out Larkin in 1:53.96.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3669917c86d71ca84eedc064515ca435c243c8d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3669917c86d71ca84eedc064515ca435c243c8d8/0_92_2744_1647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swimmers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia\u2019s silver medalist Mitch Larkin congratulates Ryan Murphy on his win in the 200m backstroke final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat can you say? I\u2019m pretty happy with silver to be honest,\u201d Larkin said afterwards. \u201cGoing into this week I thought the goal was obviously two golds. That was the major goal. Going into tonight to be honest all I wanted was to stand on the podium.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is that little bit of disappointment,\u201d he added of his fourth placing in the 100m. \u201cFor me tonight I tried to control my speed. I knew like I said last night that the back end of the races is where the medals can be won and I think Murphy had a good back end and so did the Russian, so to hold on for silver I was pretty happy.\u201d</p> <p>It was only the third time that an Australian had claimed a medal in the event, following on from Mark Kerry\u2019s bronze at the 1980 Moscow Games and Matthew Welsh\u2019s bronze at Sydney in 2000.</p> <p>In the women\u2019s 200m breaststroke, Taylor McKeown faded late to finish in fifth position after looking a medal chance for much of the race. Her time of 2:22.43 was slower than her semi-final swim as Japan\u2019s Rie Kaneto swam 2:20.30 to claim gold. \u201cI probably panicked a little in that race,\u201d McKeown said afterwards, \u201cbut it\u2019s a learning mistake and hopefully I can learn for that for next time.\u201d</p> <p>Moments later the news wasn\u2019t as bright for Emily Seebohm, who finished sixth in the women\u2019s 200m backstroke semi-final to miss a spot in the final, but in the other semi her team-mate Belinda Hocking finished third to qualify for the final. </p> <p>Earlier in the session Cameron McEvoy continued his disappointing Games by missing the final of the 50m freestyle, though speculation continues that the Australian has been unwell this week. \u201cIt was another chance of stepping up and racing at the Olympics and that within itself was pretty something that is pretty special,\u201d McEvoy said afterwards. </p> <p>Responding to the concerns over his fitness, McEvoy said: \u201cPhysically I\u2019m as well as I could be on the day and that\u2019s all there is to it. That\u2019s sport. That\u2019s the Olympics. When you have to race you have to race regardless of what\u2019s happening.

Watching female athletes sweat and jostle, leap, thrust, charge and tear in sporting competition, I am, for the first tangible time in my adult life, consumed with female body envy.</p> <p>I am short, bespectacled and \u2013 otherwise happily \u2013 a little plump. As a teenager I was never quite sincere in any expressed admiration for the willowy models, actors and popstars that contemporary pop culture encouraged me to ape.</p> <p> It always struck me as odd \u2013 when it was, more than once, suggested to my face in change rooms \u2013 that to remedy a dress that didn\u2019t stretch over my breasts I should cut myself to fit the garment rather than, you know, alter the material.</p> <p>When the late-teenage realisation dawned that a little plumpness was no disincentive at all to the attentions of young gentlemen, I dispensed self doubt entirely, and helped myself to many pies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bb107119aed7aaeceea094d49c716c34c15a845\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bb107119aed7aaeceea094d49c716c34c15a845/0_0_2739_1842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Egypt\u2019s Doaa Elghobashy controls the ball in front of Canada\u2019s Kristina Valjas during the women\u2019s beach volleyball\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Egypt\u2019s Doaa Elghobashy controls the ball in front of Canada\u2019s Kristina Valjas during a women\u2019s beach volleyball qualifying match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I gaze at today\u2019s Olympian women, like the extraordinary Simone Biles, and I suddenly regret almost all my physical choices in life, longing to have worked out, toughened up, added muscle. Perhaps it is a combination of Biles, as well as the inclusion of women\u2019s rugby this Olympiad, the harder competition demanded of those working to break records on the track or in the pool, the exposure given the brutality of women\u2019s cycling, the singular physical adeptness of Caster Semanya or the refreshing recontextualisation given beach volleyball by the Egyptian women who took proudly to the sand to play their game well covered up, but this year like no other have I been attuned to the Olympics as a showcase of growing pride in female bodily strength.</p> <p>It could just be me; I\u2019m hitting my 40s, one of my knees is a little wobbly, and the demands of mid-life domestic duty has left me more than disappointed that I\u2019m strained and out of breath. But it could be a silent zeitgeist of feminist realisation that one of the final great taboos restricting the agency of women \u2013 the social policing of femininity \u2013 is finally, finally starting to wither.</p> <p></p> <p>In the west, we inherit terrible, powerful messages that disassociate what it means to a woman from what it means to be physically strong. The New Testament\u2019s insistence that women should be desired for being \u201cweaker vessels\u201d obliging men to dominate and steer them is an example of what\u2019s created if we perform gender as one of only two cultural options, defined in opposition. As <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-to-be-a-man-clue-denigrating-women-is-not-a-good-start-32897\">Australian gender theorist Jamila Rosdahl</a> puts it: \u201cthat men should be strong, aggressive and in control and women should be weak, passive and powerless.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s why the Victorians found erotic appeal in the corset for fetishising womanly \u201cphysical weakness and vulnerability ... juxtaposed with man\u2019s strength.\u201d It\u2019s why in the second world war, the American military purposely excluded \u201cmasculine\u201d women from service in the belief that physically strong women performing in traditionally male roles would \u201cproduce lesbians\u201d and destabilise the social order.

Is this the line in the sand on doping in sport? | Caroline Riot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And it\u2019s informed an outspoken sexism that persists in sport: like in 1999, when Martina Hingis described a teenage Amelie Mauresmo as \u201chalf a man\u201d, or in 2012 when Dominika Cibulkova said playing Sam Stosur was \u201clike playing a man\u201d, or 2014, when a Russian tennis official referred to Serena and Venus as \u201cthe Williams brothers\u201d. And that\u2019s just in the sport of tennis where, by the way, Tomasz Wiktorowski, the coach of Agnieszka Radwanska, boasted \u2013 in 2015! \u2013 of a decision to keep his player \u201cas the smallest player in the top 10.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause, first of all she\u2019s a woman, and she wants to be a woman.\u201d</p> <p>But maybe it\u2019s the sport of tennis that\u2019s also helped to de-lace the cultural corset of the old gender binary, because when I think of the woman I want to be, it\u2019s Serena Williams\u2019s example to which I aspire, not Agnieszka Radwanska\u2019s.</p> <p>Because while Williams may be leaving Rio after a shock upset to the Ukraine\u2019s Elina Svitolina, the cultural victory is already hers. As one of the most decorated athletes, of either gender, in any sport, of all time, her example is proudly one amid the many women of this Olympic generation unafraid to define what it means to be a woman, free from the old traditions that oblige weakness \u2013 and entirely on her own terms. And that, more than any race, heat, triumph, loss or medal in this Olympics, is worth being excited about.</p>",

In a piece on the site, SBS sports reporter Lucy Zelic said Zela was \u201cjust one step towards change\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where you are free to express your opinions, where the courage of your conviction is applauded not reprimanded and where you can be yourself with the hopes that one day, the world too, <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/topics/zela/article/2016/01/22/welcome-wonderful-world-zela\">can share our views</a>.\u201d </p> <p>But just eight months on \u2013 in the middle of the Rio Olympics \u2013 we hear the spirit of Zela has died. The spin from SBS management is that it was always a trial and was intended for review at the end of the financial year. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided that whilst we won\u2019t continue the site in its current form, women\u2019s sport continues to be a priority for the network and best-placed to be incorporated within our other successful cross-platform sports offering,\u201d a spokeswoman said. </p> <p>Insiders say it sadly didn\u2019t get the hits it deserved, but the timing of the decision, as interest in women\u2019s sport surges, is disappointing.</p> <h2>\u2018Australians aren\u2019t stupid\u2019 officially hyperbole</h2> <p> Andrew Bolt\u2019s presentation of global warming in a segment on the Bolt Report might have been \u201chyperbolic\u201d but was not inaccurate, the <a href=\"http://www.acma.gov.au/theACMA/ACMAi/Investigation-reports/Television-investigations/2016-television-investigations\">broadcasting watchdog has found</a>. A viewer of Bolt\u2019s show, when it was on Ten last year, had complained to the Australian Communications and Media Authority that a graph used by the global warming sceptic was \u201cneither accurate nor scientific\u201d. Acma said: \u201cMuch of Mr Bolt\u2019s language was hyperbolic, such as, \u2018great global warming scare campaign\u2019, \u2018Australians aren\u2019t stupid\u2019, \u2018can\u2019t be fooled for long\u2019, \u2018all that propaganda\u2019, \u2018scaremongers\u2019, \u2018there\u2019s been no Armageddon\u2019 and \u2018no wonder\u2019. The use of hyperbole indicated that Mr Bolt was giving his subjective personal opinion about the matters being discussed and was not presenting a concluded scientific position about global warming in the segment.\u201d</p> <h2>Flight from the dailies</h2> <p> The exodus of journalists from daily journalism to PR continues. The former editor-in-chief of the Age Andrew Holden, with 30 years\u2019 experience in the newsroom, has been appointed head of communications for Cricket Australia. Holden started his new gig this week. Also jumping to the dark side is one of the Australian newspaper\u2019s Shanahans. Not political writer Dennis Shanahan but one of his sons, Leo. He is joining political pollsters Crosby Textor Group after a stellar run covering courts for the paper in Sydney, as well as business investigations and a stint on the now-defunct News Corp opinion site The Punch.</p> <h2>ABC on the back foot over Gaza</h2> <p> The ABC\u2019s coverage of Gaza is a particularly sensitive area, and this week a <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2016/s4482633.htm\">story by Middle East correspondent Sophie McNeill</a> from June had to be corrected because mistakes crept in after the reporter filed her story. The ABC apologised for the errors, which included 7.30 host Leigh Sales saying it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d for Palestinians in Gaza to seek urgent medical attention in Israel.</p> <p>\u201cThe ABC concedes this exaggerated the real difficulties of Palestinians seeking medical treatment in Israel,\u201d the correction said. The other error was referring to Gaza as occupied in an online version of the story. \u201cThe errors were introduced as a result of editing in Sydney.\u201d</p> <h2>Wombat and Roosters stories prove costly</h2> <p> It\u2019s been a bad week for media companies and defamation payouts. Fairfax Media was ordered to pay $300,000 to personal trainer Sean \u00adCarolan and Channel Ten was ordered to pay \u201csubstantial damages\u201d and legal costs to former Liberal politician Michael Yabsley. Yabsley successfully sued Ten for a story by Adam Walters which was broadcast on the network in July last year. Yabsley, who now runs the <a href=\"http://www.wombathollow.net.au/wombat-hollow-forum\">Wombat Hollow</a> political discussion forum in the NSW southern highlands, described the story Walters did on him as \u201cfast and loose\u201d. \u201cThe inescapable fact is that the material broadcast by Channel Ten about the Wombat Hollow Forum was full of lies, provided by the spasmodic, give away, tabloid publication <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lattelifeSH/\">Latt\u00e9 Life</a>. Channel Ten fell for Latt\u00e9 Life\u2019s lies, perversions and distortions hook, line and sinker.\u201d </p> <p>Walters, whose previous story about Sydney businessman Charif Kazal was <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4411599.htm\">extensively covered by Media Watch</a> and later corrected by Ten, recently left the network.<br></p> <p> In the Fairfax defo case, columnist Peter FitzSimons and the publisher were sued for defamation for stories in 2013 that implied Carolan\u2019s personal training business Nubodi had conducted tests on Sydney Roosters rugby league players without their consent, passing them on to organised crime. In the supreme court, Justice Lucy McCallum said: \u201cInexplicably, however, Fairfax did not seek to prove that contention by calling a single football player to give evidence that he did not consent to have his blood tested in the manner that occurred.\u201d</p> <h2>60 Minutes losses </h2> <p>Channel Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes has taken a couple of hits recently and they had nothing to do with the reputational damage the show suffered from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/27/60-minutes-producer-sacked-and-reporters-warned-over-child-abduction-story\">kidnapping stunt in Lebanon</a> for which Tara Brown and the crew were jailed for two weeks. Producer Stephen Rice left the network after the fiasco, and now two more staffers have followed, although for very different reasons. </p> <p>Last month award-winning producer Rebecca Le Tourneau <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/60-minutes-parts-ways-with-producer-rebecca-le-tourneau/news-story/eba7a56ac58fa5baa30b1315267be99e\">left the network</a> after pleading guilty to a drink driving charge. This week the rival Seven network announced it had poached 60 Minutes reporter Michael Usher. Known affectionately as Musher, he was the public face of the show in the midst of the Beirut crisis. But now he has nabbed his ideal job as a senior reporter with Seven News, a job which apparently wasn\u2019t available at Nine. </p> <p>Although 60 Minutes may seem like the dream job for a TV reporter, the travel is less than conducive to family life, and most roving correspondents eventually find it too hard to keep up.</p>",

Newhouse said Jane was left suffering from severe shock.</p> <p>Newhouse said the government insurer also refused to offer any compensation, including for initially losing the complaint, then not replying to or responding to the complaint, and then denying a claim that was made after the three-year limitation period allowed under the law, because Jane had been waiting for the outcome of the complaint before making the claim.</p> <p>\u201cThey dismissed her, and effectively ignored her,\u201d Newhouse told Guardian Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/14/race-row-rages-on-over-gurrumul-hospital-ordeal\">Gurrumul hospital row highlights Indigenous health obstacles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI believe the government and the health department and the hospital all behaved unconscionably,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she should have that recognised.

There are also many other challenges that Indigenous Australians have to confront during and after hospital visits that deserve attention.\u201d</p> <p>Naomi Williams, 27, did not survive her visit to the emergency department of Tumut hospital, in regional New South Wales, on New Year\u2019s Day this year. Her case is another being examined by the project. </p> <p>A coroner found that Williams, a Wiradjuri woman, died of meningococcal and septicaemia, a dangerous blood infection that can attack and affect organs including the heart. She died hours after being sent home from the emergency department of Tumut hospital with paracetamol. She was six months pregnant.</p> <p>\u201cShe was told to take some Panadol and sent home,\u201d her mother, Sharon Williams, wrote in a letter to the state\u2019s health minister, Jillian Skinner. \u201cWithin 24 hours she was dead. How could this happen?\u201d</p> <p>Like Jane, Naomi had also attended the emergency department on previous occasions in the weeks before her death. </p> <p>On one of those visits, Naomi was referred by hospital staff to drug, alcohol and mental health services. But Williams said that her daughter did not drink or use drugs apart from occasionally using marijuana.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Murrumbidgee local health district, which oversees Tumut hospital, said that meningococcal meningitis could be \u201cvery difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease as many symptoms are common to many mild viral illnesses\u201d.</p> <p>All hospital procedures had been followed, the spokeswoman also said, adding that the hospital now used a critical care advisory service, which included the use of telehealth cameras to link to specialist clinical advice at Wagga Wagga rural referral hospital.</p> <p>Naomi\u2019s is a story that resonates with Samuel and Norma Dinah, who live in Western Australia. Their 44-year-old son, Samuel Jr, died in April 2013 from an ear infection that spread to his brain. In the month before his death, an ambulance had been called three times, his father said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd, three times, they sent him home with Panadol,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She was told to take some Panadol and sent home.
