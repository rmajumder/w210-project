It\u2019s turned out we were exactly right. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m told there are 24 measures, not 21. They are not all measures that Labor had included in its costings.</p> <p>\u201cSo the government has been entirely deceptive with this and if their first action is to lie to the Australian people about what was meant to be their centrepiece bill that really tells you what the Turnbull government is going to be about.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/coalition-pushes-tax-cuts-as-superannuation-and-marriage-equality-battles-loom\">Coalition pushes tax cuts as superannuation and marriage equality battles loom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPlaying a game of lying about what\u2019s in the legislation isn\u2019t going to get them anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>The government has built up the importance of the savings bill in the lead-up to Tuesday\u2019s opening of the new parliament and the prime minister declared in the first Coalition party room on Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/conservatives-flex-muscle-over-marriage-equality-and-18c\">that budget repair was \u201ca fundamental moral challenge\u201d.</a></p> <p>But the government\u2019s failure to produce the text of the bill early on Monday meant the Labor caucus was not in a position to assess the measures \u2013 which means if the government is relying on Labor\u2019s support, which it says it is, proper debate on the bill will not be able to get under way this week.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/22/senior-labor-mps-want-to-keep-welfare-payment-they-previously-wanted-to-scrap\">Strong internal debate is continuing in Labor</a> over whether the opposition should support some of the measures in the omnibus legislation, including a proposed cut to pensions and Newstart, courtesy of the abolition of an energy supplement \u2013 a saving worth $1.4bn over four years.</p> <p>A meeting of the left caucus in Canberra on Monday was dominated by concerns from MPs about axing the energy supplement, which affects people living below the poverty line, and two additional measures \u2013 a $1.3bn saving Labor has booked from abolishing the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) and a potential cut to children\u2019s dental programs.</p> <p>Burke, the environment spokesman, said Labor\u2019s policy before the election was not simply a cut to Arena but also a commitment of an additional $300m in investment in renewables. \u201cIt was moving money form being used in one way to being used in another,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Burke said in the omnibus proposal the Coalition was asking Labor to support the cut without any commitment to the reinvestment. He said the two elements of Labor\u2019s policy went together.</p> <p>The omnibus proposal also includes a cut to welfare benefits for people held in psychiatric confinement that Labor rejected during the last term in parliament and did not nominate as a saving during the campaign.</p> <p>It is not clear when the package will move to substantive debate but the backbench briefing note about the omnibus bill makes clear the abolition of the energy supplement needs to happen during the spring session of parliament, because the schedules take effect in March and July 2017.</p>",

Warren Entsch</a> and Simon Birmingham that Labor risks delaying marriage equality for yeras.</p> <p>On Monday the Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman told Guardian Australia \u201cthere is no plan B\u201d if Labor blocks the plebiscite.</p> <p>\u201cThe plebiscite is not the worst option, as Labor and others suggest, the worst option is that marriage equality is not achieved in this term of parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be an injustice on gay and lesbian men and women to defer this issue for three or more years.\u201d</p> <p>On Sky News, Credlin suggested a private member\u2019s bill could pass the Senate, allowing the opposition a chance to suspend standing orders to pass same-sex marriage in the lower house.</p> <p>She said that would require 76 votes, which would mean three Coalition MPs would have to cross the floor, assuming Bob Katter voted with the government.</p> <p>But Zimmerman said conscience votes were not allowed on procedural motions, so Liberal MPs could not assist Labor in bringing on a same-sex marriage vote.</p> <p>LGBTI rights groups have reacted to the growing opposition to the plebiscite, with Just Equal and Parents and Friends of Lesbian and Gays Australia encouraging it to be blocked and Australian Marriage Equality warning parties must find a way through the impasse.</p> <p>Greenwich told Radio National on Tuesday the government could help address Labor and others\u2019 concerns by revealing the plebiscite question and ruling out public funding for the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d cases.</p> <p>He suggested a fair phrasing for the plebiscite question would be \u201cDo you support marriage between two people regardless of gender?\u201d<br></p> <p>Asked who would be to blame if marriage equality were delayed by three years, Greenwich said: \u201cEveryone, all of our elected representatives will be to blame.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a situation where we\u2019ve got 84 supporters in the House of Reps and 41 in the Senate \u2013 that\u2019s enough to get the legislation through.</p> <p>\u201cIf Labor, the Liberal party, the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team can\u2019t together to break this impasse they will be all held accountable.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Just Equal, Ivan Hinton-Teoh, said he expected that once the plebiscite was knocked on the head \u201cthe government will look again at a free vote, and even if a free vote isn\u2019t allowed only a handful of Liberals need to cross the floor for marriage equality to pass\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

There is a canyon of difference, however, between bad decisions and allegations of rape,\u201d she wrote. </p> <p>Parker told Ebony that those initial remarks came from a \u201cstandpoint of ignorance\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, when I started reading them comments I had to call some people and say, <em>What did I do wrong? What did I say wrong?\u201d </em>he said. \u201cI called a couple of sisters that I know that are in the space that talk about the feminist movement and toxic masculinity, and just asked questions. <em>What did I do wrong? </em>Because I was thinking about myself. And what I realized is that I never took a moment to think about the woman.\u201d</p> <p>Danielle asked Parker directly how he would classify what happened between him, Celestin and the woman back in 1999.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ll say this, I think that they are more things than the law. I think there is having a behavior that is disrespectful to women that goes unchecked, where your manhood is defined by sexual conquests, where you trade stories with your friends and no one checks anyone. At 19, that was normal. As a 36-year-old man, if I looked at my 19-year-old self as my son, if I could have grabbed him earlier before this incident, or even just going to college. Because for me, it\u2019s about this incident, but it\u2019s about a culture that I never took the time to try to understand. I never examined my role in male culture, in hyper-masculinity. I never examined it, nobody ever called me on it.</p> <p>So if I\u2019m 36 and I have my 19-year-old self, I\u2019m pulling him to the side, and saying, \u201cListen bruh, throwing on your Timbs and your fitted hat and strolling campus trying to get a girl to say yes, or going to the club hoping you bring a girl home, that\u2019s not the way to go about healthy relationships. You need to step back. You need to think about how that affects you, how it affects them, how it affects the women in your life.\u201d</p> <p>The crazy thing is a lot of people \u2013 a lot of men, if I\u2019m just speaking for myself \u2013 don\u2019t really start thinking about the effect of hyper-masculinity and false definitions of what it means to be a man until you get married or until you have kids. Because then all of sudden you have something to protect. In all actuality, we got to do better about preparing our men for their interactions with women.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it comes to consent, Parker said he \u201cnever thought about consent as a definition, especially as I do now\u201d. His definition, he said, has changed and he has talked to his college-age daughter about consent issues on campus.<br></p> <p>\u201cBack then, it felt like \u2026 I\u2019ll say this: at 19, if a woman said no, no meant no. If she didn\u2019t say anything and she was open, and she was down, it was like how far can I go? If I touch her breast and she\u2019s down for me to touch her breast, cool. If I touch her lower, and she\u2019s down and she\u2019s not stopping me, cool. I\u2019m going to kiss her or whatever. It was simply if a woman said no or pushed you away that was non-consent,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Parker also addressed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ebony.com/news-views/nate-parker-homophobic-comment-422#axzz4H99MH3tZ\">alleged comments</a> he made in the past, that he would not play a gay character in order to \u201cpreserve the black man\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that I said I wouldn\u2019t wear a dress, or that I\u2019m not interested in gay roles, I can see now that was being exclusionary. It was being insensitive, and it was being homophobic. </p> <p>\u201cI got work to do. I got a lot of work to do within myself,\u201d he said.</p> <p>After the interview with Ebony, Gay <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rgay/status/769595548819136512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweeted</a> that she sees Parker listening and trying to grow. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think but I see you,\u201d she wrote.

  "<p>Two days after Facebook announced it was replacing the humans that write the Trending Topics descriptions with robots, a fake article about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/29/facebook-fires-trending-topics-team-algorithm\">appeared in its list of trending stories</a>.</p> <p>On Friday, Facebook announced that in a bid to reduce bias it would make the Trending feature more automated and laid off up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/17/facebook-trending-news-team-curators-toxic-work-environment\">26 contractors hired to write and edit the short descriptions</a> that accompanied each trend. <a href=\"http://qz.com/769002/after-replacing-human-editors-with-an-algorithm-facebook-ended-up-with-a-fake-trending-news-story/\">On Sunday</a> a story headlined \u201cBreaking: Fox News Exposes Traitor Megyn Kelly, Kicks Her Out for Backing Hillary\u201d found its way into the list of trending stories \u2013 despite the fact that it\u2019s not true.</p> <p>Facebook hasn\u2019t completely replaced humans with robots. There are still people involved in the process to \u201cconfirm that a topic is tied to a current news event in the real world\u201d, says the social network. As the Megyn Kelly episode shows, there are clearly flaws in that process.</p> <p>The case illustrates how Facebook has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/in-its-fight-against-fake-news-facebook-found-a-resiliant-fo\">lost its battle with fake news</a>. </p> <p>In January 2015, the social network <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/01/news-feed-fyi-showing-fewer-hoaxes/ \">updated the news feed</a><a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/01/news-feed-fyi-showing-fewer-hoaxes/\"> </a>to \u201creduce the distribution of posts that people have reported as hoaxes\u201d. The problem is that people are easily fooled by fake news too, and a plethora of tricky-to-distinguish fake news sites have emerged. Facebook\u2019s hoax detection system relies on user-submitted notifications that a link is fishy; if users don\u2019t spot a story is a dud, neither does Facebook. </p> <p>This problem becomes more pernicious as it leaks out into the real world. In the past month, there have been two cases of mass panic at airports \u2013 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/chaos-new-york-jfk-airport-reports-possible-shooting-evacuation\">JFK on 14 August</a> and at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/panic-at-los-angeles-airport-lax-after-noise-mistaken-for-gunfire\">LAX on 28 August</a> \u2013 where false reports of gunmen were whipped up by social media in the absence of official information or instructions. </p> <p>Compounding the issue is the news that Facebook will soon allow users to trigger the Safety Check setting during emergencies. The feature was <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101699265809491\">launched in October 2014</a> to allow users to flag to their loved ones that they were safe during major natural disasters. It has since expanded to cover terrorist attacks as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe next thing we need to do is make it so that communities can trigger it themselves when there is some disaster,\u201d said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/29/12692468/facebook-safety-check-community-trigger-emergency\">speaking at at town hall meeting in Rome on Monday</a>.</p> <p>Moving from a top-down disaster alert model to a bottom-up one should, in theory, help Facebook counter some of the criticism it received for being biased towards western nations. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/04/facebook-clickbait-algorithm-change-newsfeed\">Facebook wants to stop clickbait. (And you won't believe how they're doing it)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the company activated the Safety Check tool after the terror attacks in Paris in November, critics argued that it should have activated the tool in places like Lebanon, where terrorists <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/article/facebook-safety-check-paris-beirut\"> killed twice as many people on the same day</a>.</p> <p>While it makes sense to try to bring more balance to the Safety Check system, allowing anyone to trigger it themselves could add legitimacy to the kind of chaotic herd behaviour seen at JFK and LAX.</p> <p>Zuckerberg insists that Facebook is a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-zuckerberg-idUSKCN1141WN\">technology company and not a media company</a>, building tools instead of creating content. However, as Facebook\u2019s algorithm \u2013 which, after all, is built and maintained by human beings \u2013 decides which content people see in their news feeds, it is arguably irresponsible for the company to allow misinformation to spread unfettered when it is now so influential in the daily distribution of news. </p> <p>\u201cMachines think in black and white,\u201d said Mandy Jenkins, head of news at Storyful, which specialises in verifying and distributing social news. \u201cI don\u2019t think verification can be automated yet. What something means to be real and verified is not black and white.</p> <p>\u201cA judgement call has to happen. It\u2019s about asking questions and seeing how a story adds up against other facts we know. What is the background of the source or site? Who is the person who wrote this story? Where does it come from? These are too many questions for a robot to answer on its own.\u201d</p> <p>Trained humans with fact-checking and journalism skills, such as those fired from the company last Friday, aren\u2019t 100% foolproof, but they can intervene to keep algorithmic wildfire at bay. Perhaps it\u2019s time for Facebook to rehire them?<br></p> <p>Facebook did not respond to requests for comment. </p>",
  "<p>I was on family vacation when Colin Kaepernick decided to make me care about football. During Friday night\u2019s preseason game against Green Bay, the 49ers quarterback did what many black people have been waiting for more of our black football players to do for a long time \u2013 he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/29/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-effect-on-career-nfl\">protested</a>. It was a quiet protest, the act of sitting during the national anthem, but it was heard around the world.<br></p> <p>When interviewed after the game, Kaepernick <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem\">explained:</a> \u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d </p> <p>In many corners, this didn\u2019t go over well, to say the least. Some people <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/People-are-burning-their-Kaepernick-jerseys-9189057.php\">burned</a> their Kaepernick jerseys. Many argued that, while Kaepernick <a href=\"http://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/article/Kaepernick-anthem-protest-Wrong-place-for-a-9188378.php?t=df6bad66567d4f3860&amp;cmpid=twitter-premium\">may be right</a> to be upset by the thousands of black and brown people killed by police in the US, protesting the flag <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-players-there-are-better-ways-for-kaepernick-to-affect-change/\">was not the appropriate way</a> to create change. Others asked why he <a href=\"http://www.allenbwest.com/allen/message-non-oppressed-black-man-colin-kaepernick\">hates veterans</a> \u2013 still others, <a href=\"http://freedomdaily.com/kaepernick-hates-america-converted-religion/\">why he hates America</a>. Yet more people asked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=kaepernick%20%22stick%20to%20football%22&amp;src=typd\">why he can\u2019t just stick to football</a>. But every argument against Kaepernick\u2019s protest is wrong. Every single one.<br></p> <p>Furthermore, many of them are racist. And the backlash against Kaepernick displays how everyday Americans who would never consider themselves racist can get caught in acts of white supremacy. </p> <p>For starters, there is nothing more American than protest. It\u2019s built into our history and our mythology. I imagine that those who think protesting during the National Anthem is un-American think that the Boston Tea Party was a literal tea party with tiny cakes and monogrammed napkins. </p> <p>Just about every major change in this country to bring America closer to its ideals has been brought about by protest. The women\u2019s suffrage movement, the Montgomery bus boycott, labor protests, the Stonewall riots \u2013 how much time do you have? If someone can call a group of <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/03/us/oregon-wildlife-refuge-protest/\">armed ranchers</a> occupying federal buildings over cattle grazing rules \u201cpatriots\u201d while labeling one man sitting to protest the murder of thousands of American citizens \u201cun-American\u201d, it\u2019s time for them to examine their biases and priorities.</p> <p>To those arguing that Kaepernick\u2019s protest insults veterans: soldiers did not fight and die for a song or a flag. They fought for many other reasons \u2013 American ideals of liberty and equality, access to education, economic opportunities, the draft. </p> <p>And many of these veterans are people of color, who sacrificed overseas only to come home to a country whose service meant nothing to the police officers who only saw their black skin and deemed them a threat. Veterans like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Kenneth_Chamberlain_Sr.\">Kenneth Chamberlain Sr</a>, who was shot and killed by police in 2011 when his medic alert necklace was accidentally triggered. Veterans like <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/01/22/georgia-police-officer-indicted-for-murder-in-shooting-of-unarmed-naked-black-veteran/\">Anthony Hill</a>, who was shot and killed by police this year while suffering from what relatives described as a nonviolent mental health crisis due to PTSD from serving in Afghanistan. Veterans like <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/19/cops-taunted-black-veteran-as-he-died.html\">Elliott Williams</a>, who was left paralyzed, naked and crying for help, unable to reach food or water, on a jail cell floor for six days in 2011 until he died from his injuries and dehydration. These men signed up to fight for us, and Kaepernick is fighting for them.</p> <p>And to those who would argue that Kaepernick hates America when he should, as a rich sports star, have no complaints: this is one of the few lines that manages to be condescending, racist and ignorant all at once. </p> <p>Most black people in America did not choose to be here. Most were brought here against their will and still suffer the socio-economic consequences of being treated for hundreds of years as cattle. </p> <p>Black men in America are <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/the-real-story-of-race-and-police-killings/?_r=0\">3.5 times</a> more likely than white men to be killed by police, the average white household has <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2015/03/26/the-racial-wealth-gap-why-a-typical-white-household-has-16-times-the-wealth-of-a-black-one/#4b6280b16c5b\">15 times</a> the average net worth of the average black household, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/04/racial-disparities-criminal-justice_n_4045144.html\">one in three black men</a> can expect to see prison in their lifetimes, and the infant mortality rate for black babies is up to <a href=\"http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/03/03/42483/why-do-black-infants-die-so-much-more-often-than-w/\">three times</a> higher than that of white babies. Despite all this, because Kaepernick happened to win the lottery of talent and circumstance to become a professional athlete, he is supposed to ignore the realities of life for so many others who look like him?</p> <p>And as to why Colin Kaepernick can\u2019t just stick to football: 68% of professional football players are black, yet only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule\">16% of head coaches are black</a> \u2013 and 0% of owners. So if we <em>haven\u2019t</em> been discussing race in football, we\u2019ve been neglecting to do so to the detriment of black players who find that they have little representation in the positions that affect their careers. </p> <p>Furthermore, the thought that there\u2019s ever a \u201cbad time\u201d to discuss racial oppression and police brutality is incredibly privileged and harmful. Black Americans do not get to decide when to encounter racism and police brutality in America. People have been killed while <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/news/darrien-hunt-shot-by-police-while-cosplaying/\">cosplaying with a toy sword</a>, while <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Amadou_Diallo\">reaching for a cellphone</a>, while walking <a href=\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/akai-gurley-nypd-officer-indicted-police-shooting-stairwell-unarmed-man-291429301.html\">up the stairs to their own apartment</a>. A brown friend of mine was pushed and kicked a few weeks ago by an elderly white lady for daring to walk in front of her in a crosswalk. </p> <p>We cannot choose when racism affects us, and it is cruel to insist on choosing when discussions of racism affect you. You can be a professional football player, an accountant, a politician, a teacher \u2013 if you are black, you cannot escape the harmful and even deadly effects of racism in America. Colin Kaepernick is black every minute of every day of his life, and his money and his fame will not remove that blackness. Nor will they keep him safe when he\u2019s out of uniform.</p> <p>What Kaepernick has done with his simple protest is brave.

So on Sunday, my friends and I went to hear The Suffers, for no other reason than we thought the lead singer, Kam Franklin, looked cool. She was one Afroed black woman among an ensemble of mostly white men, singing her heart out. The jumbotron showed us what our mere eyes could not: she and all her bandmates wore T-shirts that read Eleanor &amp; Tarika &amp; Aiyana &amp; Rekia &amp; Miriam &amp; Renisha\u2026 all names of black <em tabindex=\"-1\">women</em> killed by the police, women whose stories, and sometimes whose names, we don\u2019t know. It was a small, powerful gesture, as was what she asked us to do before she performed their hit Make Some Room \u2013 hug the person we came with, and tell them <em tabindex=\"-1\">thank you</em>. And if we came by ourselves, find another solo person and hug and thank them. With just these two small moves, Franklin nicked open what is possible at Afropunk \u2013 the opportunity to connect with and influence people with your words and presence.</p> <p> In addition to The Suffers\u2019 T-shirts, I found myself inspired by all the things festivalgoers wore. I thought I was cool, but I had no idea where people had gotten T-shirts that said \u201cBlack Girls Got the Juice\u201d and \u201cBlack Girls + Magic = Very Real\u201d and the Afropunk sign with its rules of acceptance (No Sexism. No Racism. No Ableism., etc) to include No Donald Trump.</p> <p> The festival organizers did their part by making it clear that there were no male- or female-designated bathrooms. Above the rows of port-a-potties read this sign: \u201cThis bathroom has been liberated from the gender binary.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/25/afropunk-2016-family-reunion\">Afropunk 2016: 'It always felt like a family reunion to me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> If you live in New York, Brooklyn in particular, you can find a way to always be immersed in a forward-thinking, cultural experience; you can see bathrooms, or any number of things, that have been liberated from all the binaries on Earth. But many people who attend the festival come from elsewhere; and this sign, unromantic as it was hanging above plastic toilet stalls, was another one of those small gestures to welcome the many individuals who don\u2019t fit in to just one stall, or just one life.</p> <p> Or, as Janelle Mon\u00e1e called from the stage Sunday night, this was for the \u201coutcasts, the misfits, the weirdos\u201d. After her set, during which she performed her own hits, as well as Prince\u2019s Let\u2019s Go Crazy, I wound up talking to a friend from college who, despite having gone to our historically black institution and living in nearby Jersey City, still needed all-black spaces like this one in order to just <em>be</em>. To be weird and different, whatever that might mean, inside or outside of the park gates.</p> <p> Across the wide swath of performers, one common element was the influence of original black American music. Both Mon\u00e1e and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Roman GianArthur performed James Brown songs, complete with the simple, clean choreography that\u2019s so ingrained into black showmanship. At the Bad Brains-Living Color-Fishbone \u201cPowerjam\u201d on Sunday night, George Clinton, perhaps the godfather of weird, and the natural link between Brown\u2019s funk and Bad Brains\u2019s and co\u2019s punk, performed again \u2013 age 75, and about to release a new album on fellow festival performer Flying Lotus\u2019s Brainfeeder label.</p> <p> Closing out the festival was none other than Ice Cube, perhaps the least punk headliner in recent memory. \u201cI\u2019m a b-boy,\u201d he said. \u201cAin\u2019t no band up here.\u201d Just him, a DJ, and soon after, NWA members DJ Yella and MC Ren. That was Cube being <em>his</em> weird and different self, in a space where drums and guitar were the law of the land. He assured us he wasn\u2019t just a dude in kids movies, and that he\u2019d never left hip-hop. And then he crip-walked.</p>",
  "<p>The phone in your pocket gives you powers that were hard to imagine even five years ago. It can talk to you, listen, and give sensible answers to questions. It knows your fingerprint and recognises your face and those of all your friends. It can buy almost anything, sell almost anything, bring you all the news you want, as well as almost all the books, films and music you might want to look at.

A dissident in the UAE appears to have had his iPhone hijacked by a very sophisticated piece of malware produced by a security company and sold legally, if in secret, to regimes that want to spy on their enemies. This offers its controllers complete knowledge of anything the infected phone is privy to: that\u2019s all the contacts, all the messages of any sort, whether chats, texts or emails, all the calendars and even, potentially, any voice conversation that it overhears. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a more assiduous or intimate spy. And once one phone has been subverted, it becomes a tool for spying into all other the networks to which it or the owner has access.</p> <p>This is not exclusively Apple\u2019s problem. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/06/google-stagefright-megabug-patch-nexus-phones-samsung-android\" title=\"\">much more widespread Android system</a> is reasonably secure only on some Samsung and LG models and Google\u2019s own-branded Nexus phones, which are updated frequently and automatically to keep abreast of security vulnerabilities.

Little of this is used for spying (though there is a market among jealous and abusive men for software that will enable to them to track their partners, one reason why some women\u2019s shelters are reluctant to allow smartphones inside). Much more damage is done by \u201cransomware\u201d, which encrypts and in effect steals all of a user\u2019s data, to be released only on payment. Such assaults are becoming increasingly common.

  "<p>According to Sturgeon\u2019s Law, 90% of anything is crap. It was named after Theodore Sturgeon, who came to the defence of science fiction in the 1950s. \u201cThe claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other artforms,\u201d Sturgeon mused, confirming both the truth and the futility of his theory \u2013 ultimately, it comes down to how one defines \u201ccrap\u201d.</p> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s law was cited during a provocative debate midway through the Edinburgh international book festival on a question that has dominated discussion for 10 days: how to define young adult (YA) fiction. But despite the intensity and frequency of this conversation, with speakers including Frances Hardinge, Marcus Sedgwick and Simon Mayo all addressing it throughout the festival, no one \u2013 not even the authors writing the books \u2013 seems sure how to define it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/20/young-adult-books-that-grownups-should-read\">The eight best young adult books \u2013 and why grownups should read them, too</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Was it born from SE Hinton\u2019s The Outsiders in the US in the 1960s, or across the pond, by Alan Garner in the UK?

Is YA a genre or a category? Who reads it? Is it too grown up? Badly written? Not funny enough? </p> <p>To bursts of nervous laughter, YA author Anthony McGowan <a href=\"http://www.barringtonstoke.co.uk/blog/2016/08/22/ya-not-ya/#more-7635\">kicked it off by citing Sturgeon\u2019s Law</a>: 90% of YA was crap, pandered to by an audience that treated the whole thing as a \u201cthis kind of amorphous quasi religion\u201d, more of a cult than category. He lamented speaking to \u201cmonocultural audiences\u201d of white, older women at YA conferences. Some misogynistic, cause-and-effect musing began: most YA bloggers were women, all his editors were women, \u201cso there is a huge amount of energy directing these kinds of texts, texts that may well appeal to women in their 20s and 30s rather than to teenagers. We\u2019ve got this female-dominated world producing texts that reflect themselves, for other young adult women,\u201d he said, perhaps unaware of the significance of making links between gender and perceived quality (Anthony McGowan <a href=\"http://anthonymcgowan.com/anewsite/why-i-am-a-misogynist/\">has responded to this comment here</a>).</p> <p>YA may not be a genre (it is a category, as is so often sighed), but the debate devolved into a value judgment regardless, as debates around genre so often do. \u201cI don\u2019t think adults should read YA stuff,\u201d McGowan argued. \u201cI think they should move on and read Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky or Dickens and stop reading Twilight and The Hunger Games,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cIt is part of being a grown-up, you leave those things behind.\u201d</p> <p>This did not go down well. \u201cI am 49, so I have lived more years of my life than I have left to live and I am not going to waste those years reading Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy!\u201d the author Patrice Lawrence announced, to applause, from her spot in the audience.</p> <p>\u201cI was bloody fuming,\u201d seethed one older woman, in line to pick up her copy of The Lie Tree signed by Hardinge, a couple of days later. \u201cHe completely hijacked the event. No one talked about how we define YA at all.\u201d Her friends agreed (after hearing McGowan speak, I couldn\u2019t help noticing they were all middle-aged). Another attendee, a children\u2019s bookseller in her 20s, rolled her eyes when I asked if she went, likening the discussion to the TES article, now infamous among YA readers (\u201cAnother old guy who hasn\u2019t read any YA\u201d.)</p> <p>Tellingly, YA authors at other events were always quick to espouse the greatness of their teen audience, but also quick to deny that they wrote specifically for them \u2013 the very paradox McGowan was talking about. The wide spectrum of today\u2019s YA audience was very noticeable in the festival\u2019s bookshops, where \u201cadult\u201d and \u201cchildren\u2019s\u201d covers for the same books could be bought from the same shelf. Jenny Downham, at the great YA debate, recalled seeing her book Before I Die in both the YA and adult fiction sections. \u201cI thought it was pretty stupid because it was taking shelf space away,\u201d she said (though in marketing terms, it seems pretty clever).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/sep/19/young-adult-fiction-speaks-to-all\">Young adult fiction is loved because it speaks to us all \u2013 unlike adult stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what did emerge from this conversation? As <a href=\"http://eegatland.livejournal.com/105740.html\">Wein wrote afterwards</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t believe anything new and exciting was revealed, but everyone enjoyed ranting.\u201d Did we learn that it is impossible to have a civil conversation about YA? That there is a conspiracy of women flooding the market with awful fiction?</p> <p>Along with Sturgeon\u2019s Law, there is another theory I like to believe in: Occam\u2019s razor, that the simplest explanation is usually correct. And, simply, YA is just another category of culture going through a period of self-reflection. As in the TV we watch, the art we like, the books we read, they all must, somehow \u2013 always \u2013 improve us. A sort of moral roughage to struggle through so we can emerge from the other side reformed. </p> <p>This is all the more true when children are involved; of course parents like to think all books are educational rather than purely entertaining, just as authors want to believe their works will have some sort of lasting impact on small lives. But accessibility is not an indication of stupidity any more than difficulty means worthiness. As one 20-something plaintively said to McGowan at the debate: \u201cPeople should just enjoy what they enjoy.\u201d Who cares how we define it.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>While the burkini debate has stoked considerable coverage and discussion abroad, the debate is nothing new at home. To me, it seems to be a follow-up in a long wave of anti-Muslim measures in France preceded by intense media propaganda for at least 30 years, arguing that Islam is incompatible with democracy and thus a danger for France.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jul/20/france-feminism-hijab-ban-muslim-women\">France\u2019s feminists are colluding in oppression by supporting headscarf ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The present witch-hunt against women wearing a burkini, and their exclusion from public beaches, marks the unrolling of a movement to restrict the fundamental liberties of Muslim women. The rhetoric used to justify this exclusion is becoming more and more violent. At the forefront of this battle is the French prime minister, Manuel Valls. In 2012 \u2013 while serving as minister of the interior \u2013 he declared that Jews may wear their kippas with pride. Yet, in 2013, he said the headscarf was, for him, a problem. He has consistently repeated this line, conflating the headscarf with \u201cveil\u201d to dangerous, provocative effect. The League for the Rights of Man \u2013 yes that is what the French call human rights \u2013 has referred one of these decrees to the highest judicial authority in matters of administrative justice, the Conseil d\u2019Etat. This institution declared on 26 August that the mayor has exceeded his powers and failed to present facts to prove the burkini threatens public order. But the most interesting part was the answer to the mayor\u2019s decree that <em>la\u00efcit\u00e9</em> \u2013 secularity \u2013 does not exist in public places.</p> <p>The concept of <em>la\u00efcit\u00e9</em> rests on the law of 1905, which decrees that the state and religious authorities are separate. Religious authorities can no longer \u2013 as they could before \u2013 intervene in the affairs of the state and the state must no longer \u2013 as it could before \u2013 intervene in religious affairs. The state protects freedom of conscience, and therefore all beliefs, religious or not, equally, and does not subsidise any. That it can be interpreted so that the state has the right to regulate expression of opinions or beliefs in public is founded, in part, on bad faith, but also on subsequent events in France, which are not laws but administrative decrees. These decrees were passed in the 1920s and the 1930s. They required public servants to assume a neutral appearance and not wear signs of their beliefs or opinions. (The French are not aware that France is the only country in the world to require neutrality of appearance from its public servants.)</p> <p>Another source of misunderstanding lies in the fact that<em> services publics </em>is used to name the services of the state \u2013 such as schools, hospitals, administrations \u2013 and that the places that belong to no one and therefore to everyone, such as the street to start with, are called <em>espace public</em>. The latter means that it is the space of the public; but increasingly, politicians (as well as the media) playing on the word reclaim it as the space of the state. It may seem a minor point but it is crucial in attempting to understand how the law allows Muslim women in France to be dehumanised. The Conseil d\u2019Etat has made it abundantly clear that the mayor\u2019s decree in Nice constitutes a \u201cgrave and blatantly illegal attack against the following fundamental freedoms: freedom to come and go, freedom of conscience, and personal freedom\u201d, slowing down the witch-hunt for now.</p> <p>But for how long? And will Muslim women who wear a headscarf \u2013 who cannot work in state services and are increasingly excluded from the private sector \u2013 ever recover the right to earn a living? A slow handclap then for the French establishment that claims to wish so ardently for Muslim women to achieve independence from their men, and yet deprives them of the means to acquire it.</p> <p><em>Separate and Dominate: Feminism and Racism After the War on Terror by Christine Delphy (Verso, \u00a314.99) is out now</em>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2016 to clarify that a reference to Muslim women being unable to work in state services was to Muslim women who wear a headscarf.</p>",
  "<p>It is surprising that the former home secretary and current prime minister seems unaware that the Equality&#xa0;Act&#xa0;2010 contained section 1, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/apr/28/letters-equality-legislation\" title=\"\">addressed the issue of class</a> \u2013 not very clearly, however.

  "<p>Even Kyle Edmund, for whom self-effacement has become an adornment, had to admit that his three-set wipeout of the once-formidable Richard Gasquet on the first day of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/usopentennis\" title=\"\">US Open</a> was the best win of his career.</p> <p>In the context of opponent, circumstance and the manner of execution his 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 victory against the 13th seed in just an hour and 41 minutes in killing midday heat here on Monday, was even better than his two outstanding singles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/17/davis-cup-great-britain-serbia-tennis\" title=\"\">wins for Great Britain in the Davis Cup quarter\u2011final against Serbia in Belgrade</a> earlier in the summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/28/tennis-us-open-andy-murray-rio-olympics\">Britain\u2019s tennis players ready to reap benefits of Olympics at US Open</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the tight but exposed Court&#xa0;Five in front of a small but vocal gathering of supporters, the player considered most likely to succeed Andy Murray as British No1 demolished an opponent once considered by his admirers to be the Scot\u2019s equal.</p> <p>Edmund later analysed his performance with professional detachment, neither over-excited nor complacent. Nor was he about to dismiss his next opponent, the toweringly obscure Ernesto \u201cNeto\u201d Escobedo, ranked 201 in the world.</p> <p>\u201cOn ranking I think it\u2019s my best win,\u201d the world No84 said of his victory against a distinguished opponent nine years older and 70 places ahead of him in the rankings. \u201cAnd the way I went about it, the way I played, a lot of things went well. Days like this feel really good. There are definitely days where they are not like that; that\u2019s when you put the work in.\u201d</p> <p>Edmund was quicker in thought and deed than one of the smartest players on Tour, out-hitting him off the ground and bossing him behind a big serve. The last of his 10 aces sealed the win, leaving the Frenchman drained and resigned. Even Gasquet\u2019s dangerous and elegant single-handed backhand, one of the sport\u2019s treasured sights, let him down: 10 of his 22 unforced errors came there, with Edmund inducing a further nine on the backhand. That is intelligent tennis: spotting an unexpected weakness and cashing in.</p> <p>The overall points differential of 82-52 singularly described the gap between them in such a short match.</p> <p>\u201cI definitely played better than I expected to be playing,\u201d Edmund admitted. \u201cThe last few days actually have been a lot better than the start of the trip. So there were good signs. It just really clicked today. I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d</p> <p>Gasquet was breathing hard from the middle stages of the match but he said there was no residual pain from the back injury that cut him down at Wimbledon. The Frenchman said of his opponent: \u201cI\u2019ve seen him many times play so I knew how good he is. He deserved it. He played well, will be very good in the future. So I\u2019m not surprised at all.\u201d</p> <p>Gasquet\u2019s good days, which are still a delight, are spread more thinly now. He said later: \u201cI need time.\u201d While Edmund, at 21, has plenty of it, Gasquet does not.</p> <p>The Briton, who broke six times but did not panic when his opponent struck back early in the third, hit 40 clean winners, 30 of them through his rippling forehand, but he showed plenty of match savvy as well, cutting down the space at the net as he invited Gasquet to try passing through the reduced spaces on either flank. On the day, that landscape shrivelled in the heat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/28/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-balance-us-open-pressure\">Andy Murray finds balance as he looks to cap his finest summer yet at US Open | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I did go a break down, I thought I didn\u2019t do too much wrong,\u201d Edmund said. \u201cI didn\u2019t make enough first serves; maybe he was trying to get something going so he was playing a little bit more freely, but, the way I had been playing, very consistently, I wasn\u2019t playing out of myself. I was very confident with what I was doing, I knew it wasn\u2019t going to take much to get that back. I just remained calm.\u201d</p> <p>In the second round on Wednesday, Edmund plays someone about whom even some seasoned tennis writers knew little. The American wildcard Escobedo was in control at 6-4, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3 when Lukas Lacko pulled out injured. Escobedo, born in Los Angeles, is the son of a Mexican truck driver who was not that keen on his son playing tennis until he saw how good he might become. Edmund will show Se\u00f1or Escobedo if his ultimate faith in 20-year-old Neto is in any way justified at the highest level. Before reaching the second round here, his best result was the semi-finals of a Monterrey Challenger event last year.</p> <p>Edmund remains cautious. \u201cI played him in the first round of the Binghamton Challenger last year. I think that was three sets. I honestly can\u2019t remember a huge amount of the match. It\u2019s a good opportunity for him. Maybe on paper he is not as high ranked as someone like Gasquet. But, again, you have to respect the opponents. You have to stay in the present. Start looking elsewhere then you\u2019ll get called out. I have always done that. There is a reason he\u2019s in round two \u2013 because he\u2019s playing well.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It was comforting to hear that Camber Sands would be enjoying lifeguard cover during the bank holiday weekend, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/26/lack-of-uk-law-requiring-lifeguards-on-all-beaches-means-varied-presence\" title=\"\">your report</a> (27 August) pointed to the patchy picture regarding lifeguard cover in general along Britain\u2019s long coastline. In our experience the relevant authorities need do no more than look across the English Channel.</p> <p>Like the UK, France has a long coastline with an abundance of beaches, but we experienced a very different approach to safety on our recent holiday on the coast near Boulogne and Le Touquet. At each resort there were teams of attentive lifeguards at all times in the daylight hours, actively monitoring the many thousands of holidaymakers. They had defined zones, guards at the water\u2019s edge, boats patrolling just offshore and on-beach vehicles, with a rescue station at the top&#xa0;of the beach in every case.</p> <p>Each time the tide came in, the lifeguards would order everyone out of the water. One guard explained that the tide comes in so fast, like a low tidal wave, that it is very dangerous, especially for children or weak swimmers. Every beach had full signage on display, in French and English, showing just what happens in such circumstances.</p> <p>In short, we experienced well-organised and efficient lifeguard services on every beach, even those next to small villages and towns.<br><strong>Patrick and Jenny Coffey</strong><br><em>Heathfield, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 We have just enjoyed a week at De&#xa0;Haan on the Belgian coast. Over a kilometre stretch of shore there were lifeguards positioned every 200 metres on raised chairs. In addition there were four lifeguards on foot patrol. There were two motorised dinghies patrolling the sea about 50 metres offshore, each with two lifeguards aboard.</p> <p>According to a lifeguard on duty on Friday there are 16 lifeguards present throughout the day during July and August. The costs are met by the government budget. There have been no&#xa0;drownings in more than 30 years.</p> <p>I can\u2019t find figures for the numbers of holidaymakers on the beach at peak time, but based on my observation I estimate they total many thousands (but fewer than those reported at Camber Sands). The primary imperative of government is to protect its citizens, and it is clear Belgium takes this&#xa0;responsibility seriously.<br><strong>Charles Groutage</strong><br><em>Earl Shilton, Leicestershire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

A town of 185,000, 11 kilometres south of the capital, where there are streets named after AC/DC and Scorpions, surrounded by cucumber-growing country, retail parks, towns not unlike theirs, and lots of cars, Legan\u00e9s had never had a team in the first division before and they had never expected to either.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/28/barcelona-ivan-rakitic-athletic-bilbao-la-liga\">Barcelona maintain perfect start as Ivan Rakitic goal beats Athletic Bilbao</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, coach Garitano admits, is \u201cincredible\u201d, \u201cunthinkable\u201d.</p> <p>In their 88-year history, Club Deportivo Legan\u00e9s hadn\u2019t been in the first division and hadn\u2019t been in the second much, getting there for the first time in 1987: they\u2019d spent longer in <em>regional</em>, and spread the last 40 years across <em>tercera</em> and <em>segunda b</em>, the former made up of 18 regional divisions, the latter made up of four, and both theoretically amateur. Historically, their rivalry was with Getafe but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/sep/13/europeanfootball.sport\">even they left Legan\u00e9s behind</a>: when the derby came around it was against Getafe\u2019s B team. It is only three years since Legan\u00e9s were last in <em>segunda</em> b and when they were promoted to <em>segunda</em> in 2014, it was the first time they\u2019d been there in a decade. They weren\u2019t the biggest team in either division \u2013 their budget last year was \u20ac4.5m euros \u2013 and now they\u2019re the smallest in <em>primera</em>.</p> <p>The day Garitano took over as manager in 2013, there was no training ground and a pitch full of potholes. \u201cWe had seven players \u2026 and I didn\u2019t want three of them,\u201d he admits. He had never been in the first division, either. The club was restructuring under new ownership, taken over by Felipe Moreno Romero in 2009. The president is his wife Mar\u00eda Victoria Pav\u00f3n \u2013 one of three women presidents in <em>primera</em> \u2013 and while they invested around \u20ac3m, austerity was the word. With their son Felipe as sporting director, they began building; with Garitano, they grew. Two improbable promotions in three years followed.</p> <p>Reaching the first division wasn\u2019t even a target. There was no obligation, and no pressure, which might just have been part of the reason for their success. \u201cWe were happy in the second division,\u201d Garitano admits. But they didn\u2019t settle for that: having finished 10th in 2014-15, more than a dozen new players joined last season. They won only two of their first 12 games but then the run began. Before the final game, their captain gathered the squad together, and reading the speech he had prepared off an iPad in the corner of the dressing room as they stood in a circle, eyes closed, arms around each others\u2019 shoulders, told them: \u201cThis is your heart speaking \u2026 if you lose, you\u2019ll still be the best; if you win you\u2019ll be historic.\u201d</p> <p>They did win: Pablo Insua\u2019s header at Mirand\u00e9s took them up. And so here they were on Saturday night, a first division team. Better still, they had won their opening match 1-0 at Celta de Vigo and now they were facing Atl\u00e9tico, some fans forced into a choice they never expected to have to make, a measure of just how far they had come.</p> <p>It was no choice, of course. Although there were a few tell-tale signs \u2013 the man in the Legan\u00e9s shirt with the Atl\u00e9tico tattoo \u2013 there was no ambiguity. Garitano got his way: how could he not on a night like this?</p> <p>Besides, as last season progressed they\u2019d backed their team too, playing a key role. Legan\u00e9s was little but it was loud. They weren\u2019t going to miss this and nor were they going to doubt. They had sold 8,800 season tickets, the maximum in a ground that doesn\u2019t quite hold 11,000 having been expanded from 8,200 (the aim is to expand it still further, to 15,000). This is a season to enjoy and one to embed the club in its community, to elevate it above its giant neighbours, locally at least \u2013 a lesson in part learned by Getafe\u2019s failure to do the same, dropping down again a decade later without really building that base.</p> <p>There were 500 Atl\u00e9tico fans in one corner but everywhere else was blue, thousands of striped shirts like the stands had been filled with deckchairs. \u201cProud\u201d, one banner read. \u201cDon\u2019t wake up; the dream continues,\u201d said another. When Garitano quietly walked in a couple of hours before kick-off, a rucksack on his back, he picked his way through a crowd that had come to see the buses arrive, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s especially \u2013 proof somehow that they had made it. As he went through Gate 0, there was a gentle and belated ripple of applause, as if he\u2019d been barely noticed, but by the time he and his team walked on to the pitch after 10pm it was different. An occasion and a special one. In the stands was an inflatable cucumber. In the Atl\u00e9tico dressing room was a basket of real ones as promised, a gift from Legan\u00e9s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/real-madrid-celta-vigo-la-liga-match-report\">Toni Kroos nets late winner for Real Madrid against Celta Vigo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That was all they gave them. Atl\u00e9tico came, but they could not find a way through. K\u00e9vin Gameiro hit wide, Antoine Griezmann too, but mostly Atl\u00e9tico hit a wall. Jon Serantes made three superb saves; ahead of him, his team-mates made tackle after tackle. And every time they did, there was another roar, a connection built, like a cup game where one set of fans knows what the reality is but rebels against it, where every challenge is a relief, vindication, a victory. \u201cThis is a stadium where even the guy selling tickets defends,\u201d AS wrote. And as time went on so the likelihood that they would not be beaten grew; from four at the back to five, the chances reduced. It felt like, actually, Legan\u00e9s had this under control. Or maybe for the pessimists among them \u2013 and a banner at one end did declare them \u201cparanoid\u201d \u2013 that a cruel end might be coming closer.</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t; instead, history beckoned. It finished 0-0.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a shot and we didn\u2019t cause them problems. We have to improve dramatically. We did not play well at all,\u201d Garitano insisted. Meanwhile, Griezmann claimed that if Atl\u00e9tico carry on playing like this they will be fighting to avoid relegation, while a depressed-looking, exhausted team-mate of his just rolled his eyes when he was asked if Legan\u00e9s were really that good. The message was clear: <em>no, we were that bad</em>.</p> <p>Perhaps, and there will be a battle ahead \u2013 it will be Legan\u00e9s, not Atl\u00e9tico fighting relegation, they will still seek additions in the next two days, and the limitations are clear \u2013 but on Saturday night, few really cared and nor should they. They had endured but this was a moment to be enjoyed. Legan\u00e9s \u2013 Legan\u00e9s! \u2013 had done it. They had reached the second division, they had reached the first division, they had beaten Celta, and now they had only gone and held Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, European runners-up. And Garitano was critical, sure, but they could argue that they deserved this. In the dressing room is a sign: \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting here, it is because you want to do something great,\u201d it says.</p> <p>There was merit in it, certainly, and that was recognised at the final whistle. They had not let up and nor had the noise. The fans sang and chanted and accompanied every action. It rose with each tackle, interception and run, until in the last minute Mart\u00edn Mantovani dived to head away a corner at the near post and bring the opening performance to a close, just after midnight. They had emerged equal. Eighty-eight years later, here they were, unbeaten. Record breakers, too. One win, one draw, two games no goals conceded \u2013 something no debutant in Spain has done for 87 years. They are the only side in the first division not to have let in a goal.</p> <p>Ever.</p> <p>No wonder there was a sound like thunder when Mantovani dived to head away the last threat; no wonder he insisted: \u201cThis tastes like glory.\u201d</p> <p>Somehow, it had to be him: the man who had been on the point of giving up on the game at 21; who left behind his studies as a food safety inspector to come to Spain and join Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s youth system alongside Koke and David de Gea, yet still didn\u2019t make it to the second division \u2013 \u201cprofessional\u201d football \u2013 until he was 30; who slept rough in Milan the night he went to get the passport that allowed him to play, wrapping himself in cardboard boxes to blend in with others spending that night in the bus station; who joined Legan\u00e9s from Real Oviedo in 2013 and made this journey with them, the journey of their lives, winning two promotions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/22/manu-garcia-atletico-madrid-alaves-la-liga-blog\">Manu Garc\u00eda realises boyhood dream at Atl\u00e9tico after leaping Alav\u00e9s fence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mantovani is one of only three players remaining from those days, the Legan\u00e9s captain who proudly told team-mates that they would make history before the game in Miranda and whose speech before their first ever <em>primera</em> match concluded: \u201cWe\u2019re here to enjoy ourselves, lads \u2026 but I enjoy myself winning\u201d. He is the man whose speech on Saturday night, delivered as supporters arrived, insisted: \u201cnever stop believing\u201d. The man who promised to dye his hair if they got promotion in 2014 and said the same again in 2016; who did it permanently this time because his dad said that last time, a three-day job, didn\u2019t count.</p> <p>Which is why the very last final touch in Legan\u00e9s\u2019s very first home game in the top flight, greeted by the noise of the night, the biggest cheer in their history, was reserved for Mart\u00edn Mantovani\u2019s head, blue as Butarque.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 And top of the table are \u2026 Las Palmas. It\u2019s the first time they have been there for 27 years and they will be there for at least a fortnight too as this week is international break (without Iker Casillas for the first time in 16 years). They deserve it. Just like watching Brazil. Only better. That\u2019s two wins out of two, and nine goals scored. That\u2019s nine goals in two games, when last year it took them until December to get as many. That Quique Seti\u00e9n is a genius, alright. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this but we haven\u2019t done anything yet,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He was right on both counts: it\u2019s early still but everyone is enjoying this. Las Palmas have scored nine times with only eleven shots on target this season, five from five on Sunday, but that doesn\u2019t make them lucky (although Valencia were actually pretty good in the opening game against them); it is more that they aren\u2019t wasting chances because the chances they make are so clear. They\u2019re almost walking the ball in. Against Granada, their precision and pace on the break was wonderful, led by Nabil El Zhar and Jonathan Viera and \u2026 oh, what the hell, they were all pretty brilliant.</p> <p>\u2022 Las Palmas\u2019s best player was Paco J\u00e9mez. That\u2019s what Paco J\u00e9mez says, anyway. The Granada manager blamed himself \u2026 in that slightly pleading tell-me-I\u2019m-good-really way that he is sometimes prone to doing and which is wearing a little thin. Granada, it is true, were awful.</p> <p>\u2022 From 40 goals in the opening weekend to just 17 in week two. Blame Sevilla, who went from 10 to zero with a 0-0 draw against Villarreal. And they should be grateful for that too. Their best player was Sergio Rico, the goalkeeper, and they didn\u2019t manage a single shot on target. Not so fun, after all. Not this time.</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cHas dadila Festa\u201d the banner said: let the party begin. Mendizorrotza looked good for Alav\u00e9s\u2019s first game back for a decade \u2013 and so, on the pitch, did Theo Hern\u00e1ndez and Marcos Llorente \u2013 but, like Legan\u00e9s, it finished 0-0. And like Legan\u00e9s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/22/manu-garcia-atletico-madrid-alaves-la-liga-blog\">Alav\u00e9s held Atl\u00e9tico of course</a>. That\u2019s two games unbeaten for them.</p> <p>\u2022 So, Griezmann. \u201cIf we carry on like this we\u2019ll be fighting not to go down.\u201d It was quite an exaggeration but this wasn\u2019t good, that\u2019s for sure. And Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are already four points behind Madrid and Barcelona having played two newly-promoted teams. If on the opening weekend Atl\u00e9tico could count themselves unlucky, the same wasn\u2019t quite so true at Butarque \u2013 even if they wasted three or four decent chances. The look on one player\u2019s face after the game said it all. So did his silence. This felt systemic, not just a one-off. It did to him, anyway. And he clearly wasn\u2019t alone. As one headline, playing on the Legan\u00e9s horticultural theme, put it: \u201cAtletico don\u2019t play a cucumber.\u201d They don\u2019t play any football at all, in other words.</p> <p>\u2022 Oh, Valencia. Oh my. They have all of their centre-backs up for sale, have sold the only one that wasn\u2019t for sale, and their striker is on his way out. And now they sit bottom of the table this morning. What can go wrong, will go wrong it seems: they should have beaten Eibar easily and actually played quite well at times, as was the case on the opening day, but dreadful defending and worse finishing saw them lose 1-0 at Ipurua to a Pedro Le\u00f3n penalty. For the first time in 17 years, Valencia have lost their first two league games.</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cWith Barcelona, all you get to choose is how they beat you,\u201d Athletic Club Bilbao manager Ernesto Valverde said. That\u2019s not entirely true and shouldn\u2019t be taken as an abdication of duty: his team took the Super Cup off Barcelona last season, for a start, and Athletic pushed them right back on Sunday, taking them to the wire. In the end, though, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/28/barcelona-ivan-rakitic-athletic-bilbao-la-liga\">Ivan Rakitic header was enough</a> in a superb game, played in the rain the way football\u2019s supposed to be and in which both teams played very well. It was an important and very creditable victory, Luis Enrique said and he was right. It might have been a bigger one too, but for chances wasted by Lionel Messi, Arda Turan and Luis Su\u00e1rez. Yet it might also have been no victory at all.</p> <p>Athletic pressed so high that Barcelona were forced to play from very deep, the pitch feeling as long as anyone could remember. Barcelona avoided the temptation to just hit the ball forward, though, despite being put under so much pressure. In fact, they seemed to embrace the idea, walking a tightrope but emerging on the other side, overcoming the first wave and running into the space behind before meeting the next line of Athletic players 40 or 50 yards further on. It was almost as if they invited trouble \u2013 which they did at times \u2013 as a way of, in fact, inviting opportunity. As if they wanted to play a counter-attacking game \u2026 with possession. Whose design it was is open to debate: both of theirs, probably. Perhaps the best measure of how it went was that Marc- Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen completed more passes than any goal keeper in a decade \u2013 and provoked more heart attacks too.</p> <p>\u2022 Toni Kroos got a classy 81st-minute winner as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/real-madrid-celta-vigo-la-liga-match-report\">Real Madrid defeated an impressive Celta</a> side, the ball curling across the floor like a bowling ball down a lane and going in off the post.

Given that the aid industry has been talking [about] the need for more transparency for decades, it\u2019s high time we had proper independent scrutiny of where this money is going and how it is being spent.\u201d</p> <p>In June, the <a href=\"https://thesyriacampaign.org/\">Syria Campaign</a> accused the UN of breaching its principles in the conflict by effectively letting the government control aid deliveries.<br></p> <p>More than 50 humanitarian, human rights and civil society groups back a r<a href=\"http://takingsides.thesyriacampaign.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/taking-sides.pdf\">eport</a> which said the UN had given in to demands not to help rebel-held areas, contributing to the death of thousands of civilians.<br></p> <p>The report said the Assad government controlled aid by threatening to remove the UN\u2019s permission to operate within Syria.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Syrian government has used this threat consistently since then to manipulate where, how and to whom the UN has been able to deliver humanitarian aid,\u201d it adds.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/29/can-you-solve-it-are-you-smarter-than-a-carnival-reveller\">Earlier today I set you the following puzzle</a>:</p> <p><em>Three friends set off to carnival with a jerry can containing 1.2litres of rum punch. On arrival they decide to go to three separate sound systems. So they must divide the booze equally between themselves. They have brought two large bottles for this purpose. But then they discover that these bottles have no measurements on them.</em></p> <p><em>One of the friends spots an empty 50cl can of Red Stripe and an empty 15cl vial of something marked \u2018rave juice\u2019 on the ground. There\u2019s a water tap on hand to clean the can and the vial.</em></p> <p><em>The friends are able to divide the punch into three equal portions by pouring between the jerry can, the two bottles, the beer can and the vial.</em></p> <p><em>How do they do it?</em></p> <p>There are many ways to solve this, and they all require a minimum of 17 steps. The table below shows one way, listing in cl the amount of rum punch in the five receptacles - jerry can, Red stripe 50cl can, 15cl vial, two bottles - after each pouring. So, when the jerry can has 1.2 litres in it, which is 120cl, and the rest are empty, the amounts are 120-0-0-0-0.</p> <p>For the first pouring we fill the 50cl can, leaving 70cl left in the jerry can, and then continue pouring exact amounts as following:</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li>70-50-0-0-0<br></li> <li>55-50-15-0-0<br></li> <li>55-50-0-15-0<br></li> <li>40-50-15-15-0<br></li> <li>40-50-0-30-0<br></li> <li>40-35-15-30-0<br></li> <li>40-35-0-45-0<br></li> <li>0-35-0-45-40<br></li> <li>0-20-15-45-40<br></li> <li>15-20-0-45-40<br></li> <li>15-5-15-45-40<br></li> <li>30-5-0-45-40<br></li> <li>30-0-5-45-40<br></li> <li>0-30-5-45-40<br></li> <li>0-50-5-25-40<br></li> <li>0-40-15-25-40<br></li> <li>0-40-0-40-40</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>On the seventeenth pouring the Red Stripe can and the two bottles all have 40cl in them each.</p> <p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://steenhuispuzzels.nl/\">Jelmer Steenhuis</a> for this puzzle.</em></p> <p><em>I post a puzzle here on a Monday every two weeks. </em><em>If you want to propose a puzzle for this column, please <a href=\"mailto:bellospuzzle@gmail.com\">email me</a> I\u2019d love to hear it.</em><br></p> <p><em>My latest book is out this week: <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2bqxfYt\">Football School: Where Football Explains the World</a> is for children and uses football to explain subjects like maths, English, geography, physics, music, fashion, biology and more.</em></p> <p><em>You can check me out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexbellos\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alex-Bellos/326738482347?ref=bookmarks\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/100349853927591455618/posts\">Google+</a>, <a href=\"http://www.alexbellos.com/\">my personal website</a> or my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland\">Guardian maths blog</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>After five years of conflict in Syria, the figures speak for themselves. More than 400,000 people are estimated to have been killed \u2013 and another 11 million displaced from their homes. There is no end in sight.</p> <p>But if there is no dispute about the victims of this complicated war, there is increasing argument about how best to help them. Inevitably, the focus has turned to the <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/our-projects-and-initiatives/Responding_to_crisis_Syria.html\">United Nations relief mission</a>, which is only allowed to operate in Syria with the blessing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\">President Bashar al-Assad</a>.</p> <p>Damascus also restricts who the UN can work with; it keeps a list of \u201capproved\u201d international and Syrian organisations, and the UN cannot stray outside it.</p> <p>And therein lies the dilemma for the UN, which has been investing vast amounts of money into programmes designed to save lives. By poring over thousands of pages of documents, and speaking to UN insiders and aid workers, the Guardian has identified dozens of deals that will raise new questions about the UN\u2019s role in Syria, and its impartiality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/uns-4bn-aid-effort-in-syria-is-morally-bankrupt\">UN's $4bn aid effort in Syria is morally bankrupt | Reinoud Leenders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A soon-to-be-published study by the academic <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/people/readers/leenders.aspx\">Dr Reinoud Leenders</a>, who shared some of his findings with the Guardian, will add to the concerns.

The government was then given permission to remove references to sieges and violence as a reason for displacement. </p> <p>UN insiders have told the Guardian the negotiation process between the UN and the Syrian government for the 2017 plan has begun, but they do not expect a significant change in the process or outcome.</p> <p>In response to the Guardian, eight UN agencies explained in detail why they had to work with the Syrian government. They insisted they have rigorous compliance systems and say they only have to steer clear of people on UN sanctions lists \u2013 not those compiled by the EU and the US. </p> <p>However, no such sanctions exist for Syria. And privately some UN insiders admit they are reluctant to push back too hard against Assad for fear of being kicked out of the country completely; two years ago, the international NGO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/23/aid-group-mercy-corps-forced-to-close-damascus-operations-syria\">Mercy Corps left Damascus after threats from the government</a>.</p> <p>But in internal correspondence seen by the Guardian it is clear some UN staff have qualms about what is going on. And last year a letter from a number of Syrian medical practitioners raised concerns about the UN\u2019s impartiality. It was sent to the office of the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, in October 2015 and the same issues were reported to his <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sga1558.doc.htm\">High Level Panel on Global Health Crises</a>. As yet, little, if anything, has been done. One insider conceded the UN faced \u201cconstraints at every turn\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe alternative is stark,\u201d a spokesman for Unicef said. \u201cMany more children dying or suffering. This is the dilemma that Unicef and humanitarian agencies face on a daily basis. </p> <p>\u201cChildren in Syria are hurting because of the failure of politicians to reach a peaceful solution to the war. We cannot let them down. We must do everything to alleviate the suffering of children.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Government departments</strong></h2> <p>A number of ministries in Assad\u2019s government have been supported by UN agencies in recent years, even though they are all affected by the EU sanctions regime. UN departments report close working relationships with the Syrian ministries of education, health and justice as part of the humanitarian response. </p> <p><strong>Defence </strong>The World Health Organisation has spent $5,134,685 on blood bags and kits since the beginning of the conflict but, unusually, Syria\u2019s national blood bank, which is responsible for providing services for the total population, is operated by the Syrian Department of Defence, raising concerns about how the blood supplies are being distributed.</p> <p>WHO had concerns about the issue in 2013 when it drafted the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Syrian government.</p> <p>At the time, senior WHO insiders questioned the legality of working with the ministry of defence rather than a health administration, and admitted there were \u201cconcrete concerns\u201d about whether the blood supplies would reach those in need, or be directed to the military first. </p> <p>Documents seen by the Guardian show that blood supplies for one fiscal year were paid for by donations from America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-us\">Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) </a>and Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development\">Department for International Development (DfID)</a> \u2013 and both countries have imposed economic sanctions against the Syrian government.<br></p> <p>Early in the conflict, medical centres calling for blood supplies found themselves and their patients under increased scrutiny by Syrian security services, and in some cases requests for supplies led to the arrest of those protesting or fighting against the government. </p> <p>Blood bags and testing kits are not included on UN aid convoys from Damascus to areas outside of government control.</p> <p><strong>Agriculture </strong>The <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/home/en/\">UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)</a> has bought $10,875,167 worth of seeds from the general organisation for seed multiplication (GOSM) in the past three years (2013-15), and another $2,396,782 from the general organisation for fodder (GFO).</p> <p>Both organisations are run by the Syrian government\u2019s ministry of agriculture, which is on the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32012D0634\">EU sanctions list</a>. The FAO says it has to buy this material in order to deliver humanitarian assistance, and that importing \u201cthe required quantities of seed or feed into Syria from elsewhere would not be feasible or cost-effective\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9b9a636cf0c1ab7a8f6f5c8c8c5e3dcfedb5689\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9b9a636cf0c1ab7a8f6f5c8c8c5e3dcfedb5689/0_97_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian officials inspect boxes of apples from the Red Cross at the Syrian-Israeli border.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian officials inspect boxes of apples from the Red Cross at the Syrian-Israeli border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khaled Al-Hariri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Fuel </strong>UN agencies have also bought at least $4m of fuel from the state-owned company, <a href=\"https://www.unsceb.org/CEBPublicFiles/Procurement%20Network/Public%20Document/ASR_2004.pdf\">Sadcop/Mahroukat</a>, which is also subject to sanctions. The UN argues it \u201cneeds fuel to operate its programmes in Syria\u201d. It says Sadcop/Mahroukat is the sole provider in Syria of the gasoline coupons that are used to purchase fuel safely and securely.</p> <p><strong>Tourism </strong>Syria\u2019s ministry of tourism seems also to have benefited from the UN\u2019s use of the <a href=\"http://www.fourseasons.com/damascus/\">Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus</a>, which has been the central base for the relief mission since 2013. The ministry is understood to have a 35% stake in the hotel, so will probably have been paid more than $3m in the last two years. UN agencies spent $9,296,325.59 at the hotel in 2014-15.</p> <p>The UNHCR appears to have been its biggest customer. It told the Guardian it spent $6,822,445 at the hotel since the start of the conflict in March 2011. Other agencies that have used it regularly include WHO and the FAO.</p> <p>The UN says it has to use the Four Seasons because it is unsafe for its staff to work elsewhere in the city. \u201cIt is the only location cleared for UN international staff resident in Damascus by UN global staff safety requirements.\u201d</p> <p>The Saudi billionaire and philanthropist who is believed to co-own the hotel has just given $20m to Save the Children. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/alwaleed-bin-talal-meet-the-saudi-prince-giving-away-all-his-money\">promised to give away his fortune for charitable causes</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Charities and NGOs</strong></h2> <p><strong>Syria Trust for Development </strong>Due to the historically closed political system in Syria, there was no charitable or NGO sector operating in the country before 2006, when Assad\u2019s wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/asma-al-assad\">Asma al-Assad</a>, launched the Syria Trust for Development<strong>. </strong>It remains under her jurisdiction, and she is on the EU and US sanctions lists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e950c649cb684ae3a32ae56f20b22f172514f1d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e950c649cb684ae3a32ae56f20b22f172514f1d9/0_32_1109_665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visit an injured man from Tanunaah, Homs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visit an injured man from Tanunaah, Homs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Guardian has discovered the UNHCR has partnered with the trust for the past four years, handing over a total of $7.7m during the period. This year, the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has committed $751,129 to the trust.</p> <p>Syria\u2019s first lady is a pariah figure in the international community and nobody disputes that her husband\u2019s government is responsible for the forced displacement, injury and vulnerability of millions of people within the country. </p> <p>A spokesman for the UNHCR said: \u201cSyria Trust has wide presence in the country and is one of the partners with the greatest access and outreach. Syria Trust works in seven governorates and runs five community centres \u2026 it provides legal assistance to internally displaced persons.\u201d</p> <p><strong><strong>The Al-Bustan Association </strong></strong>The ABA is a charity owned and run by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/05/mossack-fonseca-panama-papers-rami-makhlouf-syria-assad-hsbc\">Rami Makhlouf</a>, one of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s closest allies, and a delivery partner of Unicef, which confirmed it had awarded \u201ctotal direct cash transfers\u201d to the organisation worth $267,933 to supply water, sanitation and hygiene, education and winter clothes.</p> <p>But ABA\u2019s marketing materials suggest deeper relationships; photos show it distributing Unicef boxes and aid, in addition to the cash transfer, and Unicef\u2019s own PR material says ABA has engaged in research for the agency. </p> <p>Not only is Makhlouf subject to sanctions from both the EU and US, but his charity is reported to be engaged in running at least three pro-regime Shabiha militias, including one which was involved in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/01/syria-crisis-first-aid-convoy-enters-besieged-daraya-since-2012\">protracted siege of the Damascus suburb of Darayya</a>. </p> <p>Over the weekend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/syria-evacuation-of-rebels-and-families-from-darayya-under-way\">residents were evacuated from the area after reaching a deal with the Syrian government</a>, worn down by years of siege and a furious bombing campaign since June \u2013 meted out in retaliation to the first UN aid convoy to reach the area since 2012 \u2013 that saw their last medical clinic destroyed a little over a week ago.</p> <p>Aymenn al-Tamimi, of the Middle East Forum, an analyst who speaks to many pro-regime militia commanders, says: \u201cAl-Bustan Association is one of multiple bodies that can ostensibly provide the cover of the Syrian state under which militias can operate. By affiliation, my understanding is foremost that the body in question will at least pay salaries for the militias. On account of Rami Makhlouf\u2019s links to the regime, this gives some sense of state control over militias with the al-Bustan affiliation.\u201d</p> <p> Unicef said al-Bustan was selected as a partner \u201cbecause of its history in supporting people in need before the crisis, its reach among displaced communities, its strong capacity and robust operating systems, and extensive presence in the targeted identified locations.</p> <p> \u201cWe only have an partnership agreement, whereby we made a direct cash transfer for programme activities in water, sanitation and hygiene, education, and winter clothes in Latakia.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Businesses</strong></h2> <p><strong>Syriatel </strong>One of Syria\u2019s wealthiest businessmen, Makhlouf is also the owner of Syriatel, the country\u2019s leading telecommunications company, which has been paid at least $700,000 by different UN agencies. That includes $464,938 from UNHCR and $96,802 from Unicef.</p> <p>In addition, Unicef paid Syriatel $147,289 for a SMS health awareness campaign after there was an outbreak of polio in the country. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-eu-sanctions-idUSTRE78N1DY20110924\">Syriatel is on the EU and US sanctions list.</a></p> <p>UNHCR said using Syriatel was necessary because there are only two mobile phone networks in the country and there is no realistic alternative because the Syrian government would likely veto any attempt by the UN to use satellite phones, which would also be much more expensive.</p> <p>\u201cImportation and operation of satellite telephones inside Syria require government approval, which is difficult to obtain,\u201d a Unicef spokesman said. \u201c[They] cannot provide the full service \u2026 to support the scale of work Unicef is undertaking to support children and families across the entire country.\u201d</p> <p>However, large NGOs working in the country cannot use Syriatel because they are prevented from doing deals with companies on the sanctions lists of donor governments. One senior NGO worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he would not be able to procure services from Syriatel because it is under economic sanctions from the EU and the US. </p> <p>Another company whose owner is known to have links to Assad, and is an associate of Rami Mahklouf, was awarded a contract worth more than $15m from UNHCR, and had smaller contracts with Unicef.</p> <p>Makhlouf is not the only sanctioned Syrian businessman making financial gains from the UN. </p> <p><strong>Transorient </strong>was contracted for $386,711 worth of goods, despite being owned by an individual under US and EU economic sanctions due to his close relationship with the Syrian government. Unicef said the money to Transorient was paid for warehousing in Homs and Tartous.</p> <p>\u201cOptions for warehousing facilities in Syria are extremely restricted. Security, access, and heavy processes reduce the number of available and functioning spaces.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Altoun Group </strong>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East signed a $88,671.72 contract with Altoun Group, a company owned by Salim Altoun, who has been on an EU sanctions list since May 2012.</p> <p>The EU said Altoun \u201cprovides financial support to the regime. [He is] involved in a scheme through Altoun Group to export Syrian oil with the listed company Sytrol in order to provide revenue to the regime.\u201d UNWRA told the Guardian the money was for generators and that Altoun was not on any UN sanctions lists.</p> <p><strong>Syrian Computer Society </strong>had a contract with UNHCR in 2013, worth $30,000. The society is known to have links with Syrian Electronic Army, which has targeted opposition figures, international media companies and donor governments.</p> <p>UNHCR said it had little choice but to use the society because it had been the only internet service provider available at the time. </p> <p><strong>Syrian chamber of commerce </strong>The chamber, some of whose members are known to have links to Assad, received $892,805.42 from UN agencies in 2013-14.</p> <p><strong>Other Syrian companies </strong>Analysis of the UN\u2019s own procurement documents show its agencies have done business with at least another 258 Syrian companies, paying sums from as high as $54m and \u00a336m, down to $30,000.</p>",
  "<p>Lewis Hamilton was bullish in the wake of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/28/nico-rosberg-lewis-hamilton-f1-belgian-gp\" title=\"\">third place at the Belgian Grand Prix </a> after losing only 10 points of his 19-point championship lead to his Mercedes team-mate, Nico Rosberg, who won from pole.</p> <p>The German would have been expecting to make a bigger dent in Hamilton\u2019s title hopes, given that the Briton started on the back row of the grid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/26/lewis-hamilton-belgian-grand-prix-grid-penalty\" title=\"\">after being penalised 55 places for taking three new engines</a>. Hamilton, however, put in a remarkable recovery drive to gain 18 places and crucially has ensured he now has a stock of power units for the rest of the season.</p> <p>\u201cThe fight is back on as far I am concerned,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cThe good thing is now I have these engines, so hopefully we will see a cleaner second half of the season because it has definitely not been the easiest so far battling for the title.\u201d</p> <p>Should the championship go to the wire, saving so many points at this race and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/24/lewis-hamilton-wins-hungarian-grand-prix-nico-rosberg\" title=\"\">winning in Hungary</a> when Hamilton took the title lead for the first time may prove pivotal. \u201cI felt I got back to my comfort level in driving and I expect to take that into the next race,\u201d he said. \u201cTo go into the summer break 19 points ahead and only lose 10, well, if someone had said: \u2018You are going to lose 10 points at the next race and take three new engines,\u2019 I would have taken that.\u201d</p> <p>This was the race of a world champion and the sort of performance that sets up his run-in for another title perfectly. He has been overeager in the past to make up places and commit to all-out attack, but on one of the world\u2019s finest circuits Hamilton gave a bravura performance of pitch-perfect control and measured aggression. He acknowledged it had required no little rehearsal and some maturity.</p> <p>\u201cIn my early days in karting we were always last because we had a crap go\u2011kart, so I had to come through and in cars it sucked at the beginning, so I was always coming from the back,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Formula One I\u2019ve had at least one year where I was at the back having to come through to the front. It\u2019s not a stressful scenario because I have been there so many times.</p> <p>\u201cThe only issue is staying out of trouble and how hard you push. My racing instinct is to get the best start possible, jump as many people as you can in turn one and hopefully you have done half the job. That\u2019s what I want to do but the other drivers are hustling for position so all the years of experience came to fruition in the race.\u201d</p> <p>Aware he would have to take engine penalties after the summer break, Hamilton had said before the race that he felt as though he was still behind Rosberg. Now he is firmly ahead and has one extra power unit in hand over his rival. Starting with the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday, he also has the run-in he would like. In 2014, he won six of the final seven races and in 2015 four from five after Belgium to win the title three races before the end.</p> <p>Toto Wolff, the executive director at Mercedes, was pleased with the result for both drivers, but expressed fears that Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen is heading for a major accident after his battle with Kimi Raikkonen. The pair were involved in an incident at turn one but, more seriously, then clashed at Les Combes and a lap later the Dutchman moved very late to block an attempted pass by Raikkonen. He has done it before, but, as previously, was not adjudged to have been at fault by the stewards.</p> <p>Wolff tried to sign Verstappen before he joined the Red Bull junior programme in 2014. \u201cHe is refreshing for me. He is a young boy I like a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cHe comes in here with no fear, no respect, puts the elbows out. It reminds me of the great ones, it reminds me of Lewis Hamilton, of Ayrton Senna. You can see that some guys are starting to think twice about how to overtake him. Until now, all that has proven is that he is on the right track.\u201d</p> <p>However, the driver\u2019s uncompromising approach is a cause for concern. \u201cThe FIA has not penalised it, the only thing that has happened is that he has been given a hard time in the drivers\u2019 briefings,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cMaybe next time he will have a harder time. I just fear it might end up in the wall heavily one day. It is refreshing, but dangerous.\u201d</p>",

Those could include control over all territorial fisheries, agriculture and social rights, as well as the European convention on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights\">human rights</a> and EU academic programmes such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/23/erasmus-scheme-exclude-british-students-brexit\">Erasmus</a>.

Under the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twowomentravel\" title=\"\">Twitter handle @twowomentravel</a>, two friends live-tweeted their journey to England so that one of them could access an abortion, turning a personal crisis into a powerful political action. Answering my questions, on the condition that her anonymity was preserved, the companion explained that while planning the journey her friend decided she wanted something good to come from it for Irish women.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative?\u201d she asks, \u201cSilence? Silence is breaking 12 Irish hearts a day. Silence is trapping migrant women in desperate situations, silence has the blood of Savita on its hands, silence is the shape of Miss Y\u2019s devastation. Silence has devastated the women and girls of Ireland, but now it\u2019s time to talk, and get real.\u201d</p> <p>They certainly got real. The pictures they shared were striking in their ordinariness: boarding a plane in the cold grey of dawn; views from taxi windows; waiting rooms with magazines; a basic hotel. They tagged Kenny in each. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwoWomenTravel/status/767296252207857665\" title=\"\">most controversial image is a lightly bloodstained sheet</a>, which they felt was important to show: they were certainly not the first women to face a long trek home, bleeding and sore.</p> <p>\u201cThe anti-choice brigade have been all over that photo,\u201d the friend tells me. \u201cThe realities of women\u2019s bodies have been glossed over for too long. We bleed, and we birth, and it\u2019s not pretty, but that\u2019s life, and that reality needs to be brought to the fore. There\u2019s no realism in the philosophical focus of the anti-choice side. They can speculate until the cows come home about when life begins. In fact, they have speculated so loudly and for so long that real lives of women and girls have ended unnecessarily.\u201d</p> <p>When #twowomentravel returned, 48 hours later, they had tens of thousands of Twitter followers and were making international headlines. \u201cWe could never have expected the response we received. It was surreal. Where do you even begin thanking people for standing with you in that situation?\u201d</p> <p>They believe that Kenny saw their tweets: \u201cHe stopped posting updates on the Olympics, which he had been doing regularly,\u201d she says. In her view, Kenny going offline speaks volumes. In any case, they are not surprised by his silence.</p> <p>\u201cHe has no compassion, no interest in the lives of women. There are more than 100,000 women who went before us. He could have listened to any number of them, and he didn\u2019t. He owes over 3,000 women a year a whole lot of money and remorse.\u201d</p> <p>The #twowomentravel hashtag was brimming with gratitude and solidarity. But there were also, inevitably, anti-choice pundits aggressively shaming the women. \u201cWe were showing photos of waiting rooms, taxis, flights. In response we got bombarded by violent rhetoric accusing both of us of murder, bombarded with pictures of mutilated foetuses.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the strangest criticism came from detractors who refused to believe that the anonymous women existed. Seemingly, even though a dozen women a day make this journey, the notion that one of them would refuse to be shamed into silence defies logic.</p> <p>The friend I interview is scathing of such critiques: \u201cNobody has to believe us. Our dignity does not rely on that. But I will say this: if you are sceptical of an eloquent, salient, honest and cutting telling of the travesty that faces so many Irish women, you are a sexist. If you doubt the ability of women to tell their stories with ferocity and confidence, even in crisis, you are a sexist. If you doubt us because we have succeeded in defying you, you are a sexist. We are not meek, and we owe no explanations.\u201d</p> <p>Right now, the friends are processing everything that has happened \u2013 one healing and taking time out following her abortion, the other dealing with media. They intend to keep fighting. \u201cWe have to break the hold of silence. We can no longer whisper. We have been failed for too long. Now is the time to be loud.\u201d</p>",

They now live on another part of their farmland, sandwiched between a hostile Israeli settlement and one of its outposts.</p> <p>For several decades now, the villagers of Susiya have lived under the constant threat of becoming homeless once again. Mass demolition of their homes and forced evictions took place in 2001 and 2011. Israel claims it has no planning permits to build on the farmland, but at the same time makes it impossible for Palestinians to obtain permits.

Not surprisingly, the communities are resisting their expulsion, knowing that without their land, they lose everything. But the Israeli authorities are fighting hard to remove them: the Bedouin are not permitted to build anything on this land \u2013 not a hut, school, kindergarten or health clinic \u2013 and are denied access to essential services such as electricity and water, on land they have inhabited for generations.</p> <p>Every week somewhere in the West Bank a family watches while their home is demolished by bulldozers. In 2016 there has been a dramatic rise in forced evictions across the West Bank.

The international community must recognise the grave human rights implications of Israel\u2019s plan to forcibly evict and transfer these communities.

  "<h2>1) Penalties proving pointless</h2> <p>That the arms race of spending within Formula One needed to be curtailed was clear to all. Fitting a new engine for each day of a race weekend had become unsustainable and limiting the number of power-unit components to five per season was designed to rein in costs.</p> <p>To an extent the policy has achieved its goal, but in Spa the policing of that rule with grid penalties was made to look farcical. Lewis Hamilton was given a 55-place drop (plus five more for breaking a gearbox seal in <em>parc ferme</em>), most of which became entirely meaningless once he had already been relegated to the back. Fernando Alonso\u2019s 60-place sanction was equally absurd. Both teams fitted three new power units \u2013 Mercedes for tactical reasons to give Hamilton a stock of parts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/27/mclaren-triumphs-spa-francorchamps-belgian-grand-prix-f1\" title=\"\">and McLaren for an upgrade</a> and because of technical failures \u2013 and the expense will not have been a concern to either team.</p> <p>Fans on Saturday were denied a qualifying shootout involving Hamilton as he took the penalty and opted to conserve his rubber, which left a hollow ring to the whole affair. The British driver has long been critical of the engine formula, and was so again last weekend, also taking aim at the penalty rule. His team executive director, Toto Wolff, agreed with him.</p> <p>\u201cThe figures are pointless and we shouldn\u2019t bother with them any more,\u201d said Jenson Button, which is true but the reality is the sport needs to find a way to control costs that does not impact on the spectacle it is selling \u2013 perhaps by deducting constructors\u2019 points \u2013 and it needs to do it right. \u201cIn Formula One every time we try to save money, we spend more,\u201d McLaren\u2019s team principal, \u00c9ric Boullier, noted after Alonso took his third engine on Saturday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/28/nico-rosberg-lewis-hamilton-f1-belgian-gp\">Lewis Hamilton comes third to keep F1 lead as Nico Rosberg wins Belgian GP</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) Verstappen is at the limit</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/01/red-bull-max-verstappen-safety-f1-lewis-hamilton\" title=\"\">He is young, he is very popular, he is talented</a> and there was evidence of all three in the Ardennes for Max Verstappen. In qualifying Verstappen had taken Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s record, held since 1961, for being the youngest driver to start from the front-row of the grid. He did so in front of a huge contingent of Dutch and Belgian fans, with both claiming him as their own. He is registered as a driver for the Netherlands, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/20/f1-dynasties-max-verstappen-red-bull-spanish-gp\" title=\"\">as was his father Jos</a>, but his mother is Belgian and he was born just 40 miles from Spa in Hasselt.</p> <p>He has been unafraid all season to take on experienced drivers, not least Sebastian Vettel on the outside of Becketts and Kimi Raikkonen in Spain and Hungary. But although he was not punished by the stewards, much of his drive at Spa has given many cause for concern.</p> <p>He was too impetuous at La Source on lap one, which is the very first place this race can be lost and where it consequently was for him, Raikkonen and Vettel (who was also at fault). But much worse was the late block in front of the Finn on the Kemmel Straight.</p> <p>Coming out of Eau Rouge in eighth gear at 200mph is no place to risk a pointless accident. He did similar in Spain to prompt similar ire from Raikkonen but again no action from the stewards. His advance to F1 has been shockingly quick with little time to learn his race craft, or indeed his limitations. \u201cWe were fortunate there wasn\u2019t a big accident because of that,\u201d Raikkonen said, and the Finn was right.

It was perfectly feasible that Rosberg would, in fact, surpass him in Belgium in the championship standings. As it transpired, though, the bigger challenge for Hamilton was not so much that, nor the glorious Spa circuit, nor even fighting through the field, but the state of his tyres. Exceptionally high temperatures all week \u2013 it was 43C (109F) on track in qualifying \u2013 combined with the Mercedes power and downforce being overly tough on the Pirelli rubber that would be running in dirty air, made everyone cautious.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/28/lewis-hamilton-belgian-gp-third\" title=\"\">Third place, then, was way beyond expectations</a> and Hamilton still has a nine-point lead in the championship. Lower temperatures, the safety car, three rivals out at turn one and the red flag all played their part as did Hamilton in keeping his head. If the title goes to the wire this was the sort of performance that would make the difference and was an object lesson to Verstappen. But what will please Hamilton even more is what awaits \u2013 he knows he is exceptionally strong going into the races that constitute the run-in.

The team\u2019s first and only pole was scored here in 2009 by Giancarlo Fisichella, who converted it into what is still their best finish \u2013 second place. They, too, benefited from the turn-one incident but H\u00fclkenberg\u2019s race was somewhat compromised by the safety car and red flag and might even have yielded a third position.</p> <p>Nonetheless both drivers put in very strong drives and such a strong result was huge for them. It is the first time they have put two cars in the top five <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/06/bahrain-grand-prix-lewis-hamilton-nico-rosberg\" title=\"\">since Bahrain in 2014</a> and most importantly it has moved them ahead of Williams to fourth in the constructors\u2019 championship.</p> <p>From 15 points behind before Spa they are now two points ahead and in a position to potentially take the greater financial reward that place will offer should they hold it until the end of the season. Fifth last season is the team\u2019s best finish but bettering it will mean a big fight with Williams.</p> <p>The Grove-based squad, who have underperformed this year, will be in no mood to give up their place as best of the rest. How much more each team can bring to this year\u2019s car with the bulk of resources already on the 2017 iteration may prove vital.

Then a water leak forced another engine change for Alonso\u2019s car and what Hasegawa admitted was a bad call when they sent him out for qualifying with an oil-pressure problem, forcing a third engine change and a 60-place grid penalty. Then, reason for cheers as Jenson Button wrung the neck of his McLaren to take ninth on the grid.</p> <p>But his actual race was short-lived after he was unceremoniously biffed out by Pascal Wehrlein on lap one. Alonso, however, had a stormer from last on the grid. He had joked about following Hamilton through the pack on Saturday but after two laps of the race he was ahead of the British driver in 11th. He avoided incident and took every advantage as the runners on soft rubber stopped early, putting him as high as fourth.</p> <p>He was never going to hold it but he did fight to the last and clung on to take seventh ahead of both Williams drivers in undoubtedly faster cars. \u201cSeventh is very good points for the team and to be in the points, on a circuit like this, was unthinkable a couple of months ago,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It moved McLaren into sixth in the championship ahead of Toro Rosso and perhaps the early optimism of the weekend was borne out. Certainly Alonso thought so. \u201cThe progress that the team has made is just amazing and if we keep this momentum for next year that will be great news,\u201d the Spaniard said.</p>",

  "<p>When Theresa May calls the cabinet to order on Wednesday morning, amid the chintz of Chequers, the roses will be past their best and the lawn covered with dew. After Britain\u2019s mad summer, the May administration will convene in Buckinghamshire finally to face the chill autumn reality: Britain voted for Brexit without a plan and the Europeans intend to shaft us.</p> <p>They may not have actually used the word \u201cshaft\u201d when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/ventotene-summit-france-italy-germany-eu-brexit-vote\">they met on the Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi last week</a>, but German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi know they hold all the strongest cards. French civil servants are trained at the <em>grandes \u00e9coles</em>, like diplomatic special forces, to spot and ruthlessly attack the weakness of negotiating partners. And May\u2019s administration goes into this critical negotiating process with an obvious weakness. It does not know whether it wants to remain in the single market.</p> <p>Chancellor Philip Hammond is said to want \u201cpartial\u201d single market access, to keep the City\u2019s passporting arrangements into the eurozone. If, in order to get it, Britain has to soft-pedal on immigration controls, that would be no disaster for the Treasury, whose growth projections in this year\u2019s budget relied on the impact of a million EU migrants over the next five years.</p> <p>Brexit minister David Davis and international trade secretary Liam Fox are champing at the bit to begin the article 50 process \u2013 naturally they have drawn up rival timelines \u2013 but have so far failed to produce any kind of blueprint for their preferred outcome, which is to quit the single market and end free movement. This leaves May struggling to assert control over the process of even coming to a negotiating strategy \u2013 hence Wednesday\u2019s away day \u2013 and in severe danger of floundering once she has to deliver her Brexit plan to the other EU heads of government.</p> <p>It is a real, serious and material split in the government of a major country. And it is backed by rival forces in society. Those for whom Brexit became a religion in the spring of 2016 do not care about the niceties of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area. They voted to leave all of it and to \u201ctake control\u201d of migration. But the economic elite of Britain, which has the strongest voice both in the Conservative high echelons and in the civil service, simply does not want Brexit. Above all it wants to maintain market access for the City, and for the major global service firms headquartered in London. For them, it is logical to hope that Europe stonewalls all May\u2019s requests for flexible market access, and that \u2013 by the end of the process, and with the economy suffering \u2013 the public will be ready to accept staying in the EU, with some minor variations on migration.</p> <p>Labour, too, is racked by the same dilemma. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/01/john-mcdonnell-brexit-will-end-free-movement-of-people\">John McDonnell\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d on Europe</a> do not, and cannot, include keeping free movement, but do include keeping the City\u2019s financial passport and single market \u201caccess\u201d. For Jeremy Corbyn the additional problem is that the European left wants Britain out of the EU pronto, before it can negotiate any dilution of the social chapter.</p> <p>Both main parties, then, are trapped between what is possible and what the British people voted for. Owen Smith may be wowing his rallies with talk of a second referendum, but the party leaderships are beginning to realise this will only be sorted out in parliament. It will be complex, messy and reputations will be minced. The only democratic way of doing it is to say \u2013 if necessary with May, Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon standing shoulder to shoulder somewhere symbolic \u2013 that Britain\u2019s aim is to remain in the single market.</p> <p>Until the delusion of the giant flounce-out is killed off \u2013 and until Liam Fox and David Davies are told to stop dreaming about it \u2013 those negotiating with Britain from the other side will have a massive incentive to force us into it. If they think it is our secret desire, or our plan B, for Britain to quit the single market cleanly, Europe will not take seriously any UK government demands for variations to single market rules, designed to keep us on the inside the market, though outside the EU itself.</p> <p>May should seek cabinet agreement for a baseline request: to remain as part of the EEA, with a humane, time-limited restriction on free movement as Britain\u2019s one demand, and then get on with it. She should make a statement to the commons that rules out leaving the single market. Any confusion that is allowed to fester over this will corrode her own authority as the Europeans sensibly deploy every trick in the book \u2013 a book going back to the era when <a href=\"http://www.hyperhistory.com/online_n2/people_n2/persons6_n2/metternich.html\">Prince Metternich</a> ran rings round Britain in post-Napoleonic Europe \u2013 to make her squirm.</p> <p>There will be uproar in Ukipland \u2013 but there always is. Not only is there no clear mandate for leaving the single market, but the negotiating positions of our major partners are now clear. They have not said \u201cgo ahead, pick and mix\u201d from the EU goodie-bag: they have said the single market plus free movement or get lost. The British negotiators\u2019 job is to prise that position apart \u2013 not rubberstamp it, which is what Fox, Davies and other hardcore Brexiters want.</p> <p>May wants to serve a full term. But both logic and principle dictate that were she to give in to the \u201cclean break\u201d brigade within the cabinet, she would have to schedule an election and fight for a mandate to lead Britain into this particularly stupid form of economic suicide. If so, whoever leads Labour should be salivating at the prospect. The Brexit moment caused many in the City to question the long-term direction of centre-right politics. By finessing May into power without a vote, and surrounding her with the grey men and women of provincial Toryism, the grandees of the party restored the impression that they could \u2013 just about \u2013 hold the line for the City, the big law firms, the service giants and big pharma.</p> <p>But if Tories want to go into an election promising to destroy 30 years of European financial integration in order to assuage the xenophobes and climate deniers of Ukip, that would be a different prospect.</p> <p>For the opposition parties, if they can recover their nerve, any confusion coming out of Wednesday\u2019s cabinet \u2013 still better any open revolt \u2013 will be a big opportunity. They should state, simply, that they will seek a vote in parliament to veto any Brexit strategy that tries to remove Britain from the single market. That principle \u2013 which needs no further elaboration since these are opposition parties, not a parallel government \u2013 could become the rock upon which Theresa May\u2019s soaraway ratings are broken, and her majority ground down.</p>",
  "<p>Humanity\u2019s impact on the Earth is now so profound that a new geological epoch \u2013 the Anthropocene \u2013 needs to be declared, according to an official expert group who presented the recommendation to the International Geological Congress in Cape Town on Monday.</p> <p>The new epoch should begin about 1950, the experts said, and was likely to be defined by the radioactive elements dispersed across the planet by nuclear bomb tests, although an array of other signals, including plastic pollution, soot from power stations, concrete, and even the bones left by the global proliferation of the domestic chicken were now under consideration.</p> <p>The current epoch, the Holocene, is the 12,000 years of stable climate since the last ice age during which all human civilisation developed. But the striking acceleration since the mid-20th century of carbon dioxide emissions and sea level rise, the global mass extinction of species, and the transformation of land by deforestation and development mark the end of that slice of geological time, the experts argue. The Earth is so profoundly changed that the Holocene must give way to the Anthropocene.</p> <p>\u201cThe significance of the Anthropocene is that it sets a different trajectory for the Earth system, of which we of course are part,\u201d said Prof Jan Zalasiewicz, a geologist at the University of Leicester and chair of the <a href=\"http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/\">Working Group on the Anthropocene</a> (WGA), which started work in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cIf our recommendation is accepted, the Anthropocene will have started just a little before I was born,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have lived most of our lives in something called the Anthropocene and are just realising the scale and permanence of the change.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Colin Waters, principal geologist at the British Geological Survey and WGA secretary, said: \u201cBeing able to pinpoint an interval of time is saying something about how we have had an incredible impact on the environment of our planet.

If you or I were crew on a smaller spacecraft, it would be unthinkable to interfere with the systems that provide us with air, water, fodder and climate control. But the shift into the Anthropocene tells us that we are playing with fire, a potentially reckless mode of behaviour which we are likely to come to regret unless we get a grip on the situation.\u201d Rapley is not part of the WGA.</p> <p>Martin Rees, the astronomer royal and former president of the Royal Society, said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/the-anthropocene-epoch-could-inaugurate-even-more-marvellous-eras-of-evolution\">the dawn of the Anthropocene was a significant moment</a>. \u201cThe darkest prognosis for the next millennium is that bio, cyber or environmental catastrophes could foreclose humanity\u2019s immense potential, leaving a depleted biosphere,\u201d he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/the-anthropocene-epoch-could-inaugurate-even-more-marvellous-eras-of-evolution\">The Anthropocene epoch could inaugurate even more marvellous eras of evolution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Lord Rees added that there is also cause for optimism. \u201cHuman societies could navigate these threats, achieve a sustainable future, and inaugurate eras of post-human evolution even more marvellous than what\u2019s led to us.

There are so many signals.\u201d</p> <p>Other spikes being considered as evidence of the onset of the Anthropocene include the tough, unburned carbon spheres emitted by power stations. \u201cThe Earth has been smoked, with signals very clearly around the world in the mid-20th century,\u201d said Zalasiewicz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c4b5cc0d83fe53da591103594caa09aeb773c2b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4b5cc0d83fe53da591103594caa09aeb773c2b7/0_107_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Another candidate to be considered as evidence of the Anthropocene is plastic pollution.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another candidate to be considered as evidence of the Anthropocene is plastic pollution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other candidates include plastic pollution, aluminium and concrete particles, and high levels of nitrogen and phosphate in soils, derived from artificial fertilisers. Although the world is currently seeing only the sixth mass extinction of species in the 700m-year history of complex life on Earth, this is unlikely to provide a useful golden spike as the animals are by definition very rare and rarely dispersed worldwide.</p> <p>In contrast, some species have with human help spread rapidly across the world. The domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future geologists. \u201cSince the mid-20th century, it has become the world\u2019s most common bird. It has been fossilised in thousands of landfill sites and on street corners around the world,\u201d said Zalasiewicz. \u201cIt is is also a much bigger bird with a different skeleton than its prewar ancestor.\u201d </p> <p>The 35 scientists on the WGA \u2013 who voted 30 to three in favour of formally designating the Anthropocene, with two abstentions \u2013 will now spend the next two to three years determining which signals are the strongest and sharpest. Crucially, they must also decide a location which will define the start of the Anthropocene. Geological divisions are not defined by dates but by a specific boundary between layers of rock or, in the case of the Holocene, a boundary between two ice layers in a core taken from Greenland and now stored in Denmark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8fefb8d64ede01c7f9d65c77b2169c1fa34f535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8fefb8d64ede01c7f9d65c77b2169c1fa34f535/0_96_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future geologists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future geologists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scientists are focusing on sites where annual layers are formed and are investigating mud sediments off the coast of Santa Barbara in California and the Ernesto cave in northern Italy, where stalactites and stalagmites accrete annual rings.

The term Anthropocene was coined only in 2000, by the Nobel prize-winning scientist Paul Crutzen, who believes the name change is overdue.

They see it very rightly as the backbone of geology and they do not amend it lightly,\u201d said Zalasiewicz. \u201cBut I think we can prepare a pretty good case.\u201d</p> <p>Rapley also said there was a strong case: \u201cIt is highly appropriate that geologists should pay formal attention to a change in the signal within sedimentary rock layers that will be clearly apparent to future generations of geologists for as long as they exist.

The move sparked outrage, with most patients and politicians turning their ire on the easiest target: the company itself. Easy \u2013 but wrong. </p> <p>For starters, brand damage can be countered with savvy public relations without helping anyone. A few days ago, Mylan promised to help families afford its sky-high prices by expanding a coupon program. But it merely <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-mylan-patients-20160825-snap-story.html\">creates another bureaucratic hoop for sick people, and some insurers may not accept it</a>.

Or the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"http://www.fiercepharma.com/sales-and-marketing/fda-swats-down-teva-s-epipen-copy-putting-mylan-cruise-control\">blocking competitors</a>, in the case of Mylan and EpiPens. We have created a system that allows these companies few or no competitors, but we are periodically shocked and publicly shame them when we do so.

Under existing law, federal funding of R&amp;D <a href=\"http://justcareusa.org/why-doesnt-the-federal-government-ensure-reasonable-prices-for-drugs-developed-with-public-funds/\">requires companies</a> to offer the medicine on \u201creasonable terms\u201d.

The federal government technically <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/051215-letter/?inline=file\">has the power to suspend a patent altogether</a>. In 2003, the Bush administration <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/attack/2001/10/23/anthrax-cipro.htm\">threatened</a> the maker of anthrax medicine Cipro with exactly that power.</p> <p>Moving forward, all new patents could include far-stricter cost protections that link prices to median income. Or, if you prefer a more flexible system, you could <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-most-radical-idea-big-pharma_us_56d4c8b9e4b03260bf77e6b9\">incentivize innovation with hefty cash prizes</a>, but place the resulting drugs in the public domain.</p> <p>Instead, today, companies take advantage of taxpayers funding <a href=\"http://justcareusa.org/why-doesnt-the-federal-government-ensure-reasonable-prices-for-drugs-developed-with-public-funds/\">$32bn </a>of research and development each year. Consider that the precursor to the EpiPen was <a href=\"http://www.peanutallergy.com/articles/symptoms-and-treatment/the-history-of-the-epipen\">the ComboPen</a>, a product developed with public funds to protect our armed forces. When companies do invest their own money, it is often in drugs that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-most-radical-idea-big-pharma_us_56d4c8b9e4b03260bf77e6b9\">generate steady long-term profits </a>(like fighting baldness), rather than one which would cure a deadly disease but only be needed for two weeks.</p> <p>Protecting pharma monopolies generates a poor return on public investment, while simultaneously spurring research into low-priority maladies. Labeling pharma execs callous or evil may be satisfying \u2013 and even occasionally correct \u2013 but it disguises the true concern. Going after companies one by one will get us nowhere.

They say they are willing to work with and pay fees to county or state regulators but that the constitution blocks the federal government from charging grazing taxes. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/01/demands_by_oregon_refuge_occup.html\">Constitutional experts say</a> the Bundys are misreading a narrow clause and that a separate part of the text clearly gives the federal government authority to manage public lands \u2013 a power that the US supreme court has <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/426/529/case.html\">affirmed</a>.</p> <p>Others argue that if anyone has ancestral claims to western lands it\u2019s the Native Americans who <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzgO-yvtvOAhVI9x4KHSnKDZgQFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2016%2Fjan%2F06%2Foregon-militia-malheur-wildlife-refuge-paiute-indian-tribe-sacred-land&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZiRBX7PEtmGwaR3SVI1QMXp4csQ&amp;sig2=f4YNLtTv-oVeE1E6vgjidg&amp;bvm=bv.130731782,d.dmo\">first occupied the region</a> and that it would be an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/08/oregon-militia-standoff-demands-what-comes-next\">environmental disaster</a> to allow unregulated grazing.</p> <p>Adding to the tension, Obama has, in recent years, significantly boosted land preservation efforts, formally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/12/obama-california-national-monuments-mojave-trails-sand-to-snow-castle-mountains\">protecting more land and water</a> than any other president in history. The Democrat enraged conservatives when he recently designated three new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/12/obama-doubles-protected-land-california-desert\">national monuments</a> in the west, sparking criticisms that he was orchestrating a massive \u201cland grab\u201d.</p> <h2>Tensions between cowboys and feds</h2> <p>The Bundy family\u2019s fight officially began in March 1993 when, after nearly 40 years, Cliven abruptly stopped paying grazing fees and applying for BLM permits. </p> <p>Grazing fees had <a href=\"http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/grazing/pdfs/CostsAndConsequences_01-2015.pdf\">increased</a> in the previous decade by around 30%, though the prices fluctuated each year, and by 1993 it cost Cliven roughly $2,000 a year to have 85 cattle graze on the federal lands by his property. </p> <p></p> <p>The family was also furious that the US Fish and Wildlife Service had classified the <a href=\"http://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=C04L\">desert tortoise</a> as a \u201cthreatened\u201d species and was moving forward with further efforts to <a href=\"http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/federal_register/fr2390.pdf\">restrict</a> land access.</p> <p>\u201cDad ... fired the BLM,\u201d said Arden Bundy, 18, Cliven\u2019s youngest son.</p> <p>The BLM, however, saw it differently. </p> <p>That year, Cliven sent repeated letters to the government saying he intended to graze cattle \u201cpursuant to my vested grazing rights\u201d and claiming that the BLM had not<strong> </strong>produced documents showing it had jurisdiction over the public lands.</p> <p>Within months, the BLM informed Cliven that he was trespassing, ordering him to remove his cattle. Tensions between the cowboys and federal regulators quickly escalated.</p> <p>On 24 January 1994, BLM agents placed a copy of a \u201cdemand for payment\u201d notice on Cliven\u2019s car. According to the BLM\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322115323/United-States-v-Cliven-Bundy-1998\">account</a>, Cliven got out of his truck, accused the federal agency of harassment, and threw the document out of his window before driving off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8938842ab286d85d377ce22dac2467bdb817b6c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8938842ab286d85d377ce22dac2467bdb817b6c0/344_0_4632_3645/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bundy family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bundy family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Hawkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of Cliven\u2019s sons then picked it up and tore it into pieces in front of the government workers. </p> <p>On 3 March 1994, Cliven sent a check for $1,961.47 to Clark County for grazing fees \u2013 his way of making a statement that he was willing to pay taxes to local governments, but not to the feds. The county refused to cash the check. </p> <p>Four years later, a federal court <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322115323/United-States-v-Cliven-Bundy-1998\">ordered</a> Cliven to remove his livestock from public lands. He refused.</p> <p>Federal officials fined Cliven for every day he refused to pay, but his cattle continued to graze \u2013 and multiply. By 2011, the BLM <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/2011.7.26_IntenttoImpoundNotice.pdf\">told</a> Cliven that it intended to impound his cows.</p> <p>In response, Cliven publicly <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322115646/United-States-v-Cliven-Bundy-2016\">stated</a> his family motto \u2013 that he \u201cwould do whatever it takes\u201d to stop the BLM. </p> <p>In March 2014, the agency told him it would soon proceed with its mass seizure operation. Cliven responded by saying he was \u201cready to do battle\u201d.</p> <p>By then, BLM said Cliven <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/nv/st/en/info/newsroom/2014/april/national_office__statement.html\">owed</a> more than $1m. </p> <p>The next month, his 14 children, living throughout Utah and Nevada, returned to the Bundy ranch to stand up to the BLM. </p> <p>They were prepared for death, said Mel, Cliven\u2019s 42-year-old son. He and his wife Briana went so far as to write up a last will and testament. </p> <p>\u201cIf it means losing my life, then yes, I am willing,\u201d Mel said. Briana, 30, said her husband wanted her to stay away for her safety, but she said she felt obligated to help \u2013 even if it meant she and her husband would be killed, leaving their four kids without parents. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If it means losing my life, then yes, I am willing</p> <footer> <cite>Mel Bundy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nothing will stop the Bundys, Briana added: \u201cThey\u2019ll have to kill every one of us.\u201d</p> <p>More than 400 people from across the US showed up to the ranch to defend the man who had become their cowboy hero. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest things that inspired us was everybody coming to our aid,\u201d said Angie Bundy, Ryan\u2019s wife. \u201cWe had people from all over the country that came out and knew what the consequences could be, and yet they came anyway.\u201d </p> <p>The supporters camped out, pitching tents in the family\u2019s back yard and waiting for the government to arrive.</p> <h2>\u2018Taking our land back\u2019</h2> <p>More than 20 snipers, some carrying assault rifles, positioned themselves behind concrete barriers high above on highway bridges and aimed their weapons at the officers below them. Some were dressed in military-style tactical gear, while others hid behind unarmed supporters, using them as shields to mask their movements.<br></p> <p>This was the dramatic scene that the government <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322115646/United-States-v-Cliven-Bundy-2016\">says</a> it faced on the morning of 12 April 2014 when, two decades after Cliven had stopped paying grazing fees, law enforcement officials attempted to take away the rancher\u2019s cows. </p> <p>The standoff unfolded on a desolate desert range near the Bundy house. </p> <p>Early in the morning, the BLM managed to corral about 400 cattle into an \u201cimpoundment site\u201d. But Cliven had hundreds of supporters at his back, and he and his sons quickly orchestrated a plan. </p> <p>Cliven told a crowd of followers that \u201cGod [is] going to be with us\u201d and that it was time \u201cto take our land back\u201d. He then commanded a group to travel about three miles down a dirt road by horse and meet near where the cattle were being held.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9e781702c192c1702d0425512d4ad9c69c0b3f83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e781702c192c1702d0425512d4ad9c69c0b3f83/0_341_5184_3114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cliven Bundy told a crowd of followers that \u2018God [is] going to be with us\u2019 and that it was time \u2018to take our land back\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cliven Bundy told a crowd of followers that \u2018God [is] going to be with us\u2019 and that it was time \u2018to take our land back\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Locher/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By around 11.50am, Ammon and a group of protesters were 150 yards from the cattle, which were protected by a makeshift metal gate guarded by two officers.</p> <p>Sixty yards from the gate, the cowboys formed a \u201chuman line\u201d that stretched across the site, and Mel, Ammon\u2019s older brother, soon after <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322159388/Cliven-Bundy-Indictment\">brought</a> a separate group of about 40 protesters on horseback.</p> <p>Agents called for backup, but the FBI and the BLM were hugely outnumbered \u2013 50 officers against roughly 400 protesters.</p> <p>Officers used loudspeakers to order the crowd to disperse.

When I sat with him in his living room in February, Cliven said he remained proud of that victory.</p> <p>\u201cHere on the Bundy ranch <strong>...</strong> we the people, the public has had access to this area,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a rancher, I have enjoyed freedom.\u201d</p> <p>Ten days after our meeting, the US government took him into custody, leveling felony conspiracy charges against him that could condemn him to die behind bars.</p> <h2>\u2018Racism is alive and well\u2019</h2> <p>One week after the FBI retreated from the 2014 standoff, Cliven\u2019s celebrity status came crashing down.</p> <p>Most of the media circus had left Bunkerville, but Cliven was still holding regular press conferences at his ranch where a few supporters lingered. </p> <p>On 19 April 2014, wearing a cowboy hat and short-sleeve white button down, Cliven, speaking to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6X8bkv8E8\">conference</a> that drew a total of one reporter and photographer, went on a meandering rant about abortion, abuses of welfare and race.</p> <p>In comments reported by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html\">New York Times</a>, he said: \u201cI want to tell you one more thing I know about the negro. </p> <p>\u201cBecause they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I\u2019ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn\u2019t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\u201d </p> <p>The backlash was swift and brutal. US senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Dean Heller of Nevada, who had expressed support for the Bundys\u2019 cause, were forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/25/cliven-bundy-saga-republicans-far-right-rand-paul\">dissociate themselves with the rancher</a>. Cliven lost allies in the conservative media, too: Fox News host Sean Hannity <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/24/sean-hannity-cliven-bundy-fox-news_n_5206516.html\">said</a> his remarks were \u201cbeyond repugnant\u201d, and radio host Glenn Beck <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/glenn-beck-cliven-bundy-unhinged-105991\">called</a> him \u201cunhinged from reality\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"305ade462790c66715a8ba528542ae335d08ec75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/305ade462790c66715a8ba528542ae335d08ec75/0_613_4991_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cliven Bundy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cliven Bundy lost allies in the conservative media after ranting about abortion, abuses of welfare and race.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Hawkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many saw the remarks as a direct manifestation of the deeply embedded racism of rural white conservative westerners. </p> <p>\u201cIf you went and did a study of the people who live where they are, I think you would find racism is alive and well,\u201d said Terri Robertson, a <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/water-environment/conservationist-has-lifetime-secrets-worth-sharing\">conservationist</a> and cousin of Cliven who lives in Las Vegas and has <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/cliven-bundy?printable=true\">spoken out</a> against the family. </p> <p>Ammon said the \u201cwhite media\u201d was the only group angered by his father\u2019s comments, and that the remarks were \u201cone of the best things that ever happened\u201d because it showed the family who their true supporters were. </p> <p>Since being locked up in a city prison, Ammon said he has come to better understand the plight of African Americans.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve created a lot of friends in here that are black people,\u201d Ammon said, with a smile. A fellow inmate recently told him: \u201c\u2018Bundy, you know, I see what they did to you. They treated you like you were black,\u2019\u201d Ammon recalled. \u201cHe goes, \u2018If you ever come to one of the prisons I\u2019m at, you can sit at the black table.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The legacy of racism is not hard to trace in rural Nevada \u2013 nor in the Bundy family. Cliven\u2019s cousin, Kim Bundy, who records show is based in Ruth, Nevada, owns 120 acres of land that he <a href=\"http://images.water.nv.gov/images/Protests/81065/kim%20g%20bundy.pdf\">calls</a> the \u201cNigger Abe\u201d place.

He briefly worked construction in Las Vegas but soon after moved to Cedar City, Utah, for college.</p> <p>After a few semesters, Ammon dropped out and started a small repair business, which he ran when he met his now wife, Lisa.</p> <p>\u201cHe was really flirtatious,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI had dated lots of boys, but none of them were men. This guy was a man. He was mature.\u201d</p> <p>Ammon and Lisa married in July 2001 and eventually moved to Arizona, where he ran Valet Fleet Service. But after the 2014 Bunkerville standoff, the family relocated to Idaho, in part because they \u201cwere hoping to get away from the spotlight\u201d, Lisa said.</p> <p>But in 2015, Bundy supporters began sending the family stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/oregon-militia-standoff-occupation-dwight-steven-hammond\">Dwight Hammond and his son Steven</a>, two Harney County, Oregon, ranchers convicted for multiple arson <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-or/pr/eastern-oregon-ranchers-convicted-arson-resentenced-five-years-prison\">offenses</a> that federal prosecutors said they committed on public lands.

That helped maintain my sanity while dealing with the incredible stress that comes with living in debt. Many mornings it means just sitting with a cup of coffee and telling myself that the balances are getting lower, and that as long as I keep working, things are okay. It seems so simple, but it actually worked. I made sure to remind myself that I wasn\u2019t complete trash (even though my credit might be) as a result of my foolish financial decisions. The more I did that, the more I could look myself in the mirror each morning and actually feel good about what I had in my life.</p> <p>The last time I pulled together my finances, I made a few key decisions in reducing the amount of money I was spending per month. One of those decisions was to focus more on cooking at home instead of eating out. As a result, I\u2019ve discovered that spending time in the kitchen is a wonderfully meditative practice.</p> <p>Cooking is especially poignant in times when I have to decide between buying groceries or making more than the minimum payment on some of my bills. For the longest time, I couldn\u2019t even make a payment if I wanted to eat more than once a day. As I\u2019ve pared down my expenses and begun a regular payment schedule again, the act of cooking myself a meal reminds me of the importance of taking care of myself. I\u2019ve discovered I\u2019m actually a pretty decent cook. I just never gave myself the chance to discover that side of me, all for the sake of convenience.</p> <p>Probably the best way that I\u2019ve managed to stay happy through the insanity of major debt has been to spend time around the truly awesome people in my life. There\u2019s nothing more soothing after a stressful day than a night of commiseration and laughter with my closest friends \u2013 many of whom are in the same boat.</p> <p>It seems to be an awful trend that many people my age are up to their ears in what seems to be insurmountable debt. Many of my friends made the same mistakes I did. Some of them have lost jobs or made tricky financial gambles that cost them their savings. Regardless of the circumstances surrounding their bills, it\u2019s nice to know that I\u2019m not alone. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/13/will-boyfriend-reject-me-debt\">Will my boyfriend reject me if he finds out about my debt? | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These days, we spend Saturday nights sitting in a friend\u2019s garage, soaking up the last of the summer and enjoying each other\u2019s company.

China has also expressed interest in forging a free-trade deal with Canada.<br></p> <p>But while Trudeau\u2019s family name may open doors, observers say he will need to wade clear-eyed into the diplomatic waters with a country that is now an ambitious geopolitical power.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/anastasia-lin-miss-world-canada-falun-gong-practitioner-china-persecution\">Anastasia Lin: a Falun Gong practitioner seeking the Miss World crown \u2013 in China</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe great role Canada played in our own small way bringing China in from the cold \u2013 that was appreciated by China and is still appreciated by China.

  "<p>Last year Sam Quek was ready to put her stick to one side and call it a day. The Great Britain defender, one of the undisputed stars of their unstoppable charge to hockey gold in Rio, was struggling to recover from a rib injury. She was bereft of belief in her ability and following the heartbreak of non-selection for the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, losing faith that her opportunity would ever arrive.</p> <p>The 27-year-old, enthusiastic and still riding the wave of excitement from that magnificent fortnight in Rio, is finding it difficult to stop smiling these past few days. But when it comes to discussing the bumpy ride from the Wirral to Olympic champion, her steely undercurrent and determination, fostered by an unfamiliar path in a sport concentrated in the south of England, becomes apparent.</p> <p>Quek lives by the Robert H Schuller quote \u201ctough times never last, but tough people do\u201d and is honest when discussing the turnaround that led her from failing to make it into the reserves little more than 12 months ago to becoming the defensive bedrock of a team that won seven of their eight games in Brazil, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/gb-women-hockey-historic-gold-shootout-final-olympics\" title=\"\">defeating the Netherlands on penalties after drawing the final 3-3</a>.</p> <p>Her success is a result of perseverance and hard work but this is also a tale of never giving up. \u201cIn June 2015, I seriously considered hanging up my stick and walking away,\u201d Quek says. \u201cI missed out on Beijing and London and watched all the games from the stands. I remember post-2012 saying I never wanted to experience that feeling again. Words can\u2019t describe how painful it was to sit there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/gb-women-hockey-historic-gold-shootout-final-olympics\">GB women win historic hockey gold with shootout victory over Netherlands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEverything went well after that. We got a silver in the Europeans the following year and in 2014 I had the honour of captaining the squad [in the Champions Trophy]. For me, that was the proudest moment in a GB shirt. Plenty can say they have played, but not many can say they have captained the team. In game one of that tournament I broke two of my ribs, but didn\u2019t realise until I got home. So I didn\u2019t play my best. I did a job, but it wasn\u2019t my best.\u201d</p> <p>Things would soon get worse. Her confidence plummeted and returning to full fitness proved difficult. Approaching breaking point, some tough love from her family and partner changed everything. \u201cI came back in the following February, but I was not as strong or as fit,\u201d she says. \u201cI was playing for a good two months before the selection for the Rio qualifying tournament and I didn\u2019t even make it into the friendly matches before. I was available but didn\u2019t make it. I wasn\u2019t even in the reserves, let alone the squad.</p> <p>\u201cGoing from captain, the pinnacle of your sport, to not even being seventh-choice defender brought all of the feelings of 2012 back again. It hit me hard and there were times when I was on the phone to Tom [her partner] for hours in the night, contemplating my future and doubting if I was able to do it. I wasn\u2019t the player I was before and I was ready to give up. But he was like: \u2018Don\u2019t be silly, Sam, you don\u2019t become a bad player overnight.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/kate-richardson-walshs-hockey-team-in-historic-bully-off\">Kate Richardson-Walsh's hockey team in historic bully-off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One moment stands out. On a June evening, after training at Bisham Abbey and a Skype conversation with Tom, Quek decided to drive back north. \u201cHe sat me in the kitchen, it must have been midnight, and he had some firm words. He told me I was being ridiculous, it was all down to me and all the issues we talked about were in my control to sort out. That conversation was the turning point.\u201d</p> <p>It kickstarted a remarkable transformation from peripheral figure to vital cog. She recalls going on holiday to Croatia after being dropped for the qualification tournament and ensuring the hotel had a gym. A fitness plan was strictly adhered to \u201cwhile Tom spent his days drinking beer on the beach\u201d.</p> <p>Quek seems reluctant to take credit for her work ethic, regularly referring to her support system of family and friends and there is a sense that she is oblivious to the talent at her disposal. Things could also have been quite different if she had stuck with playing football for Tranmere Rovers.</p> <p>\u201cI played lacrosse, netball and football, but it came to a point where at about 16 I was at the same level with football and hockey and had to choose a path. I ended up playing a bit more hockey than football and I was never in the first team at Tranmere, always in the reserves, which was fair enough because there were two trainings a week but I would only go to one. I ended up playing a little more hockey and fell in love with it.\u201d</p> <p>At times, though, the love seemed unrequited. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say every day has been great because it hasn\u2019t. Looking back at my journey, it\u2019s maybe the most turbulent and roughest in terms of the team, but if that hadn\u2019t happen I don\u2019t think I would be the character I am today.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m quite proud now. There are times that I was embarrassed I didn\u2019t make selection, but I can sit here now and say that it taught me a valuable lesson, that I\u2019m in control of everything I do. I learned that quite late, but once I had that self-belief I cracked on.\u201d</p> <p>Cracking on is an understatement. Quek describes the training in Croatia and the regime after she returned to the national hockey complex at Bisham Abbey \u2013 where 31 centrally contracted players work on a three-weeks-on, one-week-off recovery system \u2013 as the best she has had. Her form returned and a place in England\u2019s European Championship squad that summer was secured.</p> <p>She was player of the match <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/30/england-women-eurohockey-netherlands\" title=\"\">in their dramatic 2015 EuroHockey final against the Netherlands</a> in London and, as fate would have it, they won on penalties after coming back from 2-0 down to draw.</p> <p>When it came to Rio and taking on the Dutch, who were going for a third Olympic gold in a row and the overwhelming favourites, there was an assuredness among the players. The game looked up at one point, but Britain\u2019s defensive resilience, led by an indomitable Quek performance, paid off when Nicola White made it 3-3 in the final period. Maddie Hinch, the goalkeeper, proved heroic in the shootout and gold was theirs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b0ac7b7c38f05617f65dac1d95906211e3a23ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b0ac7b7c38f05617f65dac1d95906211e3a23ef/0_215_3038_1823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Quek\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Quek celebrates after Team GB won hockey gold against the Netherlands: \u2018everyone said you shouldn\u2019t really be beating them.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEveryone said you shouldn\u2019t be really beating them, but we came back to 2-2 and beat them on shuttles last year,\u201d Quek says. \u201cI think once they knew we were going to shuttles, psychologically we had a bit of an advantage.</p> <p>\u201cWe were very calm and there was an aura of confidence in the team. You could see from making eye contact that we\u2019ve got this. We see from the amount of time and practice we put in doing the shuttles and the homework and scouting from previous shuttles, we were probably in the best possible place to win gold.\u201d</p> <p>Quek describes the reaction when Hollie Webb struck the winner<strong> </strong>as a blur as well as \u201cpure joy and almost disbelief as well\u201d, though she was in for another shock upon returning to the dressing room.</p> <p>Her grandmother, Dolly, had suffered a stroke during the Games, but her family decided to wait until after the final to break the news. A text message arrived and she instantly phoned home, bursting into tears after hearing the story. Dolly, who is making a full recovery, has become a minor celebrity in her own right. The video doing the rounds on Facebook of her being greeted by Quek in hospital surpassed three million views in five days. \u201cShe\u2019s probably more of a star than me at the moment,\u201d Quek says, that unassuming nature coming across once more. \u201cShe\u2019s 95, a strong woman and I\u2019m so proud I could call her my nan.</p> <p>\u201cThe most special thing was giving her a hug, regardless of the medal. It was just making sure she was OK, but she\u2019s been so proud in the hospital, telling everyone: \u2018My granddaughter won an Olympic gold medal.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/women-hockey-gold-olympics-hollie-webb\">Hollie Webb: Hockey World Cup ruin laid ground for gold medal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While on a personal level her family influence was key, it is hard not to ignore that for Team GB the path to gold was made easier by such forensic planning.

Great Britain sent an team to Brazil in advance to ensure the facilities were up to scratch and a local plumber was hired to work on their accommodation so as not to rely on the village\u2019s in-house contractors.</p> <p>Then there is the Lottery funding. While the price of each medal won by Team GB is understood to have been more than \u00a34m, Quek is right to point out that the players earn just enough to survive. There is also the pressure of performing \u2013 failure in Rio would have meant the sport\u2019s funding would be cut, which would not affect just the elite, but the grassroots.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really important for us to reach the podium and make sure we had the same funding or maybe got a little bit more,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst and foremost, that was the most important box to tick off. They basically fund each athlete to be able to train full-time.

I\u2019m half Asian \u2013 my dad\u2019s from Singapore, my mum is English \u2013 so I would like to inspire people who think they might not be suited to hockey.

Numerous endorsement offers have been made, but she will be picky. The ideal path post-hockey would be to \u201cbecome like Gabby Logan or Clare Balding\u201d on the small screen, but before that there is some more business to take care of. \u201cI\u2019m trying to enjoy it and ride the wave.

  "<p>Last week, the California state senate passed <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AJR43\">Assembly Joint Resolution 43</a>, urging the federal government to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>WHEREAS, A national carbon tax would make the United States a leader in mitigating climate change and the advancing clean energy technologies of the 21st Century, and would incentivize other countries to enact similar carbon taxes, thereby reducing global carbon dioxide emissions without the need for complex international agreements; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of California, jointly, That the Legislature hereby urges the United States Congress to enact, without delay, a tax on carbon-based fossil fuels; and be it further Resolved ... That all tax revenue should be returned to middle- and low-income Americans to protect them from the impact of rising prices due to the tax<br></em></p> </blockquote> <p>Copies of the Resolution were sent to President Obama, Vice President Biden, House Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, and to all members of Congress representing California. The document specifically calls for the type of revenue-neutral carbon tax advocated by the grassroots organization <a href=\"http://citizensclimatelobby.org/\">Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby</a>. Studies have shown that a rising carbon tax with all revenue returned to taxpayers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy\">would have a modestly beneficial impact on the economy</a>, while cutting carbon pollution at faster rates than current policies.</p> <h2>California exerts its climate leadership<br></h2> <p>California has become the US leader in tackling global warming. 10 years ago, the state passed <a href=\"http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ab32/ab32.htm\">the Global Warming Solutions Act</a>, requiring that its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 be no higher than 1990 levels. California achieved that goal in 2010, 10 years early, and is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions\">among the lowest per-capita carbon polluting states</a>. <br></p> <p>On the same day last week, the state legislature also <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article97383292.html\">passed a bill expanding the Global Warming Solutions Act</a>, requiring a 40% cut in California\u2019s carbon pollution from 1990 levels by 2030. In other words, California isn\u2019t just calling on the federal government to take action on climate change; the state is leading the way.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether any climate legislation can survive in the current toxic partisan political climate of Washington DC.

Its requirement that carbon polluters pay for the costs of their pollution appeals to the political left, while its free market, small government approach appeals to the political right. <br></p> <h2>Revenue-neutral carbon tax is hard to dislike<br></h2> <p>By returning 100% of the taxed revenue to American households, the policy blunts the rising costs of energy produced by burning fossil fuels. In fact, studies project that <a href=\"http://citizensclimatelobby.org/household-impact-study/\">a majority of Americans would receive a rebate larger than their increase in energy bills</a>; only those who use the most fossil fuel energy would see costs rise more than the rebate.</p> <p>It\u2019s a policy that\u2019s hard to dislike. It makes polluters pay, goes a long way toward tackling the immense threat of human-caused global warming, results in cleaner air and water by reducing the burning of dirty fossil fuels, and has a modestly beneficial overall economic impact. However, many in the fossil fuel industry oppose the policy for obvious reasons, and through campaign donations they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/05/the-republican-party-stands-alone-in-climate-denial\">a solid grip on the Republican Party</a>. In fact, pressure from fossil fuel lobbyists convinced House Republicans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jun/13/the-grand-oil-party-house-republicans-denounce-a-carbon-tax\">pass their own Resolution condemning a carbon tax</a> less than three months ago.</p> <p>Thus it\u2019s difficult to see California\u2019s urging having much impact on Congress. Perhaps if the 2016 elections are a disaster for the Republican Party, they\u2019ll change direction away from extreme partisanship and climate denial. <a href=\"http://citizensclimatelobby.org/ccls-promise-we-will-pass-a-carbon-fee-bill-by-the-end-of-2017/\">Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby is optimistic</a> that with enough grassroots lobbying, they can convince Congress to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax in 2017.</p> <p>It may take more states following California\u2019s lead in calling on Congress to address the climate threat. California is certainly influential - it has the world\u2019s 6<sup>th</sup>-largest economy, on par with that of France. The state put a price on carbon pollution via a cap and trade system in 2012, and since then <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=CARGSP,\">its economy has continued to grow</a> while <a href=\"http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/pubs/reports/2000_2014/ghg_inventory_trends_00-14_20160617.pdf\">emissions have fallen</a>. <br></p> <h2>An opportunity the GOP must take<br></h2> <p>It would certainly behoove Republican Party leaders to reverse their climate denial platform. This is an issue on which - as with civil rights and gay marriage - they\u2019re on the wrong side of history, and the electorate is quickly moving in the opposite direction. Climate denial is <a href=\"http://thebulletin.org/climate-change-generation-gap9351\">predominant among old, white men</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2921195/young-conservatives-to-gop-on-climate-hello-are-you-listening/?utm=share_twitter\">young conservatives want the government to take climate action</a> to preserve their future.</p> <p>In 2012, the GOP published <a href=\"http://goproject.gop.com/\">an \u2018autopsy report\u2019</a> that concluded young voters are \u201crolling their eyes at what the party represents.\u201d Focus groups called them \u201cscary,\u201d \u201cnarrow minded,\u201d and an \u201cout of touch\u201d party of \u201cstuffy old men.\u201d The report perfectly encapsulates the party\u2019s stone-age stance on climate change.</p> <p>Of course, the report also concluded that \u201cmany minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country,\u201d and the party proceeded to nominate Donald \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">ban all Muslims</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/backing-wall-republican-donald-trump-gop\">build a wall</a>\u201d Trump for president. <br></p> <p>In other words, the Republican Party correctly identified its problems in 2012, and has since proceeded to make those problems even worse. But it\u2019s only a matter of time until they\u2019re forced to shift away from the current extreme, including on climate denial, or risk permanently alienating a majority of American voters. <br></p> <p>California\u2019s Resolution is urging them to move in that direction. Don\u2019t be surprised if more states follow suit and turn up the heat on GOP climate denial.<br></p>",

In 2004, these supposedly white, male and mostly southern fans of the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/3/4/1495637/-NASCAR-has-a-political-problem-and-they-just-made-it-substantially-worse\">National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing</a> were targeted by Democrats in their battle with George W Bush. In 2016, after eight years of Barack Obama, they should be a bastion of enthusiasm for Trump.</p> <p>While other former swing demographics, such as \u201csoccer moms\u201d in the suburbs, look lost to Clinton for good, white men in America\u2019s red states are at the heart of Trump\u2019s support. Early on, the campaign heralded an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/704626119836901376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">endorsement by Nascar boss Brian France</a> and several drivers.</p> <p>Yet recently, outside the <a href=\"http://www.nascarhall.com/\">Nascar Hall of Fame</a> in Charlotte, the mood among visiting families who spoke to the Guardian before a recent Trump rally in the city seemed at best to have stalled.</p> <p>At first, Keith, a former military man from nearby Fayetteville, home to Fort Bragg, the world\u2019s largest military base, was supportive.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely against Hillary and I voted for [Trump] for the primary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no filter. He\u2019s gonna tell you the truth.\u201d</p> <p>North Carolina is perhaps the most important of the traditional battleground states this year. In 2012, it was the only swing state that Obama lost to Mitt Romney. Since then it has swung further to the right, replacing one of its senators with a Republican in 2014 and sitting at the centre of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/north-carolina-judge-transgender-bathrooms-identity-choice\">a conservative backlash</a> against transgender rights.</p> <p>Nonetheless, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">five of the last presidential opinion polls here have show Clinton ahead</a>. If Trump cannot win North Carolina, something is going badly wrong.</p> <p>Keith, who like many Trump voters was reluctant to give his surname, echoed the very issue that the campaign is most worried could alienate voters in increasingly diverse states like this come November.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Saying \u2018I am the only one who can fix everything you need\u2019 sounds a lot like a dictator in Latin America or North Korea</p> <footer> <cite>Mark, 35, from Connecticut</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe way he deals with certain things worries me,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration is a big thing. You can\u2019t just ban a certain race from coming into the country. It doesn\u2019t work that way, especially as it\u2019s the land of the free.\u201d</p> <p>For core supporters, Trump\u2019s intolerant views and loud mouth matter less. For example, Keith\u2019s friend Kaycee, an accountant from Great Falls, Montana, was less worried: \u201cI would vote for Trump even though his social game isn\u2019t so hot. He is an incredible businessman and I really think that\u2019s what America needs right now. Sometimes he has no filter, but sometimes that\u2019s not a bad quality.\u201d</p> <p>But among floating voters, particularly in states without a tradition of voting Republican but where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/01/trump-clinton-kaine-rust-belt-pennsylvania-ohio\">Trump\u2019s economic message is resonating</a>, people are easily turned off by the billionaire\u2019s brash style.</p> <p>\u201cFrom where I come from, they call him a bullshit artist,\u201d said Neil, a 63-year-old self-employed heating and air-conditioning contractor from Providence, Rhode Island, who was also visiting the Nascar Hall of Fame on the day Trump landed in town.</p> <p>\u201cI am not a big fan. I just don\u2019t trust what he says. He\u2019s got that very pushy attitude. From a political standpoint, I don\u2019t think he is doing that well. He just squirts off what\u2019s off the top of his head. I don\u2019t think he spends a lot time thinking about what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p> <p>The younger voters get, the bluer the state they come from, the more Trump\u2019s style is a turn-off. Even, it turns out, for white dads at the Nascar shrine.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s thin on policy, big on broad-based authoritarian statements,\u201d said Mark, a 35-year-old engineer from Connecticut. \u201cSaying \u2018I am the only one who can fix everything you need\u2019 sounds a lot like a dictator in Latin America or North Korea or something.</p> <p>\u201cI think he is very popular in a very narrow strip of America. That works well in a Republican primary, but not in a general election.\u201d</p> <p>A failure to capture states like North Carolina would kill Trump\u2019s hopes of winning the White House. Worse, for Republicans, the mood among potential voters here speaks to the party\u2019s concern about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/republican-donors-trump-congress-local-races-sheldon-adelson\">losing the control of the Senate</a> that was gained two years ago with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/north-carolina-midterm-elections-thom-tillis-obamacare\">victories like that of Thom Tillis</a>.</p> <p>Senate seats last for six years, so Tillis is safe for now, but his North Carolina colleague Richard Burr is up for re-election.

  "<p>Welcome to the Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States of America. There\u2019s been a coup, the president has been murdered and an all-powerful, Christian fundamentalist army has imposed a terrifying new order on its citizens. The country\u2019s borders have been shut. There is no escape. Women are the main target of the regime\u2019s brutality. Their rights and personal freedoms have been abolished. They are no longer allowed to work, to own assets or to be in relationships not sanctioned by the state. They are now categorised according to marital status and reproductive ability. They are either Wives, married to Commanders, the founders and shapers of the new regime; Econowives, the spouses of lower ranking men; Marthas, too old to have children and now domestic slaves; Aunts, the regime\u2019s propagandists; or Handmaids, considered fertile and forced to bear children for officials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/14/margaret-atwood-road-to-ustopia\">Margaret Atwood: the road to Ustopia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s against this backdrop of a nightmarish, future theocracy that we are introduced to the central character. Known simply as Offred (\u201cOf-Fred\u201d), she is a Handmaid, the literal property of the Commander. Offred is careful not to give much away and we know very little else about her: her age; that she was married to a divorc\u00e9 in former times and that the relationship was annulled; that this is why her child was taken from her and placed with another family and why she was arrested. But Offred is our window onto Gilead. We learn about her new life, her mundane routine, her daily shopping trips, her visits to The Wall to pray over the rotting bodies of dead dissidents. Offred\u2019s social function as a Handmaid is to submit to the Ceremony \u2013 a humiliating ritual of sexual intercourse in the presence of the Commander\u2019s wife \u2013 in order to conceive. She has no other purpose. Already on her second placement as a Handmaid, she knows that if this assignment fails she has one more go before she is declared invalid and shipped off to the Colonies to clean up toxic waste along with the other women that Gilead considers useless or dangerous. </p> <p>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale<em> </em>was published in 1985 to overwhelming critical acclaim. It won the Governor General\u2019s award for English-language fiction that year, and the inaugural Arthur C Clarke award in 1987. Often labelled a feminist dystopia, the novel captivates and terrifies in equal measure. Is Gilead the result of puritanism, misogyny and megalomania taken to their logical end? Is Atwood shooting readers a warning that this is where fanaticism and militarisation at the expense of humanity might lead?<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Offred\u2019s narrative is a way of protecting dignity and human experience in the face of oppression.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Undeniably. But there is another side to Atwood\u2019s story and to classify it as only a bleak, cautionary tale would be simplistic. Throughout The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, we\u2019re offered glimpses of a narrator at first pushing back against the system, and then breaking the rules. She reads fashion magazines, (\u201cI read quickly, voraciously, almost skimming, trying to get as much into my head as possible before the next long starvation\u201d), she plays Scrabble, she steals butter to use as hand cream since all cosmetics are banned. She smokes a cigarette. She risks hurried, coded conversations with her shopping partner, Ofglen. She learns of a resistance movement that has been rescuing women and smuggling them over the border into Canada. Suddenly, there\u2019s a hope. Just a whisper, but it\u2019s out there.</p> <p>She finds a message etched by a predecessor into a cupboard in her room: \u201cNolite te bastardes carborundorum.\u201d Don\u2019t let the bastards grind you down. Her confidence grows. She has sex with the Commander outside of the Ceremony. She\u2019s no longer just an object. She embarks on an affair with his chauffeur, Nick. She dares to fall in love: \u201cWe huddle together while the storm goes on outside. This is a delusion, of course. This room is one of the most dangerous places I could be. If I were caught there would be no quarter, but I\u2019m beyond caring.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/20/handmaids-tale-margaret-atwood\">Margaret Atwood: Haunted by The Handmaid's Tale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even Offred\u2019s Tale, recorded onto cassette tape and preserved for future generations, is a way of protecting dignity and human experience in the face of oppression. I was once here. </p> <p>The book ends with an academic lecture on the Handmaid\u2019s memoirs, set hundreds of years in the future. We learn that soon after Offred\u2019s affair with Nick, the Commander\u2019s house is raided by the secret police and that Offred is taken away. No one knows where to. The recording breaks off, but the implication is that the raid was staged by Nick and that Offred was very likely saved. We know that Gilead lasted many more years before collapsing. Now it\u2019s a history lesson. Atwood\u2019s final message is a promise. The regime which attempted to annihilate hope failed. The human spirit is, ultimately, indomitable. </p>",
  "<p>On 13 July at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony opened the 2016 ESPY Awards with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/14/lebron-james-call-end-gun-violence-espys\">an appeal to end gun violence and racial profiling</a>. James, just weeks removed from bringing Cleveland its first championship in more than 50 years, urged his fellow athletes to speak out on important issues and find ways they can make a difference in their communities. \u201cWe all have to do better,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The three minutes and 30 seconds of not-sticking-to-sports by four of the biggest stars in the NBA was well received \u2013 or at least as well received as anything remotely \u201cpolitical\u201d can be in our hyper-partisan times.

Without a doubt, Kaepernick\u2019s decision to sit for the anthem and avert his eyes from the American flag is optically different than a simple appeal for action. Yet the QB using his platform as an athlete to bring attention to an issue is fundamentally in line with the request made at the start of the ESPYs. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/28/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-rex-ryan-nfl\">Rex Ryan: US anthem about respect for military as Kaepernick fallout continues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bigger difference \u2013 and one that makes Kaepernick\u2019s actions far riskier and even braver \u2013 is the stature of the athlete delivering the message. James, Wade, Anthony and Paul have 15 NBA titles, Olympic gold medals and NCAA championships between them. Whereas Kaepernick might not start over Blaine Gabbert on a team that went 5-11 last season and saw its head coach get fired. People are more willing to listen to athletes whose accomplishments are unimpeachable. It\u2019s why the ESPYs opened with four NBA stars speaking and not Nick Young, Steve Blake and a couple of Sixers.

Kaepernick\u2019s play has declined every season since taking the 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2012 and last year he lost his job altogether midway through the season to a Jaguars reject. There has been little indication in camp that Chip Kelly is ready to give Kaepernick the starting job back. And that was before Anthemgate. That was before he officially became a Distraction.

You may not like what Kaepernick is saying or how he is saying it, but he has a platform with his $19m that someone making $19,000 does not. If Donald Trump \u2013 who claims to be a billionaire 10 times over \u2013 can say America loses all the time and is not great, then an athlete worth a fraction of a billion can say the country has problems, too, no? </p> <p>People listen to those with fame. They listen to athletes. They listen to LeBron, one of the greatest athletes in history. They listened to Muhammad Ali, the greatest boxer of all-time. They would have listened to one of the greatest quarterbacks ever if Kaepernick had become that. They may have even heard him. But Kaepernick isn\u2019t LeBron or Ali.

  "<p>The global coalition for a total ban on the trade in ivory is taking shape. In Africa calls for the ban are led by the 29 nation African Elephant Coalition (AEC). In the consumer countries, both the US President Obama and China\u2019s President Xi have made commitments to close the domestic markets which will have a huge impact on demand. </p> <p>To be sure, progress towards building the coalition is uneven. Key African nations such as Zimbabwe and Namibia are opposed to the ban, and have even petitioned CITES for a relaxation of current restrictions. In Europe, while the French Environment Minister S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal has signed a decree banning the trade, in the UK the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says it is still \u201cworking\u201d on its pledge to implement a total ban on ivory sales. </p> <p>Conservation organisations used the occasion of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), held in Nairobi on 27 and 28 of August to call for Japan to throw its considerable weight behind the campaign to ban the ivory trade.</p> <p>Their statement, published in <a href=\"http:// https://gallery.mailchimp.com/3020c8a54e53b0491d74af64c/files/Final_Joint_conservation_Statement_TICAD.pdf\">English </a>and <a href=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/3020c8a54e53b0491d74af64c/files/Joint_Statement_Wildlife_Direct_TAE_TICAD6_.pdf\">Japanese</a> and signed by representatives of 21 African, Japanese and international conservation groups, concluded as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Japan is one of Africa\u2019s most important development partners. They have made major contributions and commitments to support conservation. Now the conservation community call for 5 actions to be agreed at TICAD:</p> <p><strong>1. </strong>Japan to permanently close legal domestic markets of ivory, and aggressively close down online trading sites that deal in ivory, all to crush demand.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>2. </strong>Japan to suspend ivory registration immediately, to prevent loopholes that allow fraudulent registration and laundering of illegal ivory.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Japan to support the Elephant Protection Initiative.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>4. </strong>Japan to strengthen cooperation on elephant conservation initiatives and combating the trafficking of ivory to Japan through joint investigations and mutual legal assistance.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Japan\u2019s Prime Minister and First Lady to jointly issue statements to discourage the selling and buying of ivory in Japan and to initiate an education and outreach campaign to Japanese citizens on the importance of saving elephants by stopping poaching and ending ivory trade.</p> <p>Kenya is proud to be hosting the first TICAD conference in Africa and we look forward to positive outcomes of the discussions that the conservation community.</p> </blockquote> <p>Japan\u2019s support is important for three reasons. Firstly, Japan is a highly respected and influential development partner in Africa. If Japan speaks up for elephants, its voice will be heard and listened to, in ivory producer and consumer countries alike. </p> <p>Secondly, Japan\u2019s willingness to take the politically difficult decision to close down the domestic ivory trade in support of calls by AEC will provide further evidence of her commitment to \u2018African ownership\u2019 of its development.</p> <p>The third reason is that banning the ivory trade is essential to fulfil Japan\u2019s long-term commitment to fostering peace and stability on the African continent. While the spotlight has been on China, the world\u2019s largest market for ivory, Japan\u2019s contribution to fuelling the poaching and ivory trafficking epidemic in Africa has remained in the shadows.</p> <p>In fact, the situation in Japan provides one of the clearest examples of why elephants can only be saved by banning all trade in ivory, not just the \u2018illegal\u2019 trade. Sales of ivory are legal in Japan but recent evidence has highlighted how it is impossible to distinguish legal and illegal ivory. </p> <p>Speaking on the Kenyan TV programme \u2018NTV Wild Talk\u2019 Airi Yamawaki, co-founder of the Japanese-Kenyan NGO \u2018Tears of the African Elephant\u2019 described how an ivory tusk can be registered as \u2018legal\u2019 in Japan simply by asking a neighbour to sign a document vouching that is has been in your family for a long time. Registered tusks are not marked, so that same registration form can be used for multiple tusks, again and again. No registration at all is required for pieces of ivory weighing less than 1 kg.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvsj21F_FI4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cvsj21F_FI4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Airi Yamawaki of the NGO \u2018Tears of the African Elephant\u2019 talks about Japanese involvement in the ivory trade on the Kenyan TV series NTV Wild Talk. The interviewer is Smriti Vidyarthi. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Statistics from National Geographic show that as at 2014, Japan had registered 6,000 tusks, up from 500 in 2010. Yahoo Japan also closed sales worth $7 million in 2014, up from $2 million four years earlier. According to <a href=\"http://eia-global.org/images/uploads/EIA_Japans_Illegal_Ivory_Trade_12102015.pdf\">a recent report by Environmental Investigation Agency,</a> there is no meaningful control of the illegal ivory trade in Japan even at the most basic level. </p> <p>Airi Yamawaki described how in Japan, as in China, ignorance of consumers is the biggest problem that needs to be overcome. Ivory is used mainly to manufacture \u2018Hankos\u2019, personal seals that are required by law in order to conduct business transactions. These seals can be made of many materials, but ivory is supposed to bring luck, so people choose ivory without even thinking about it\u2014and without any knowledge of where the ivory comes from.</p> <p>Tears of the African Elephant has been working hard to change this situation by raising awareness among Japanese consumers through its project \u201cNo Ivory Generation\u201d, as well as reaching out to conservation organisations in Kenya. Airi told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is important that the international community does not underestimate Japan\u2019s role as an ivory consumer and the effect of legal ivory trade. With Kenya having hosted TICAD6, I hope that Kenya will use their friendship with Japan, to win their support on elephant conservation.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"476e96267bf05bfe56cbf7007ed33fbad8631290\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/476e96267bf05bfe56cbf7007ed33fbad8631290/0_94_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Visitors and activists pose at a stall set up by the NGO \u2018Tears of the African Elephant\u2019 to raise awareness in Japan about the threat to elephants from the ivory trade.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visitors and activists pose at a stall set up by the NGO \u2018Tears of the African Elephant\u2019 to raise awareness in Japan about the threat to elephants from the ivory trade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tears of the African Elephant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now elephants have a new and influential ally in Akie Abe, wife of the Japanese Prime Minister.

I spoke about the powerful bond that Kenyans have with elephants, which are revered as sacred in some tribes. Some people believe that we came from elephants and that is why we must aspire to be like them, empathetic and fiercely protective of one another. I also explained their keystone role in the ecology of Africa.</p> <p>Following her visit, Mrs Abe posted the following comment on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/akieabe\">her Facebook page</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was invited by First Lady Mrs Kenyatta, who is also doing a lot of conservation work, to visit the Sheldrick\u2019s animal orphanage.

about its impact on two vulnerable species, the yakka skink and the ornamental snake.</p> <p>The ACF argued Hunt had made an \u201cerror of law\u201d by not factoring in the impact of overseas \u201ccombustion\u201d of the coal over the 60-year life of the mine.</p> <p>Hunt had found it was \u201cnot possible to draw robust conclusions on the likely contribution of the project to a specific

frameworks\u201d in Australia and countries importing the Adani coal.</p> <p>Justice John Griffiths in his judgment ruled it was \u201cplain that the minister did give consideration to greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion emissions and made an express finding that the proposed action would not have an unacceptable impact on the world heritage values of the reef\u201d.</p> <p>Griffiths also accepted Hunt\u2019s submission that articles of the World Heritage Convention to which Australia was a signatory gave \u201cconsiderable latitude to state parties as to the precise

  "<p>If you want your child to be a healthy weight, don\u2019t use the D word. Talking about diets or even weight is bad for all adolescents, <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/08/18/peds.2016-1649\">the American Academy of Pediatrics said this week</a>. The academy\u2019s latest guidelines aim to prevent not only eating disorders but also obesity. They are particularly aimed at preventing teenagers who are trying to lose weight from tipping into eating disorders such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/anorexia\">anorexia nervosa</a>. Neville Golden, professor of pediatrics at Stanford University Medical School and lead author of the guidelines, said that <a href=\"http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2016/08/new-guidelines-offer-one-approach-to-prevent-teen-obesity-eating-disorders.html\">40% of those admitted for eating disorders are dieters</a> who got out of control. \u201cScientific evidence increasingly shows that, for teenagers, dieting is bad news,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Teenagers in the US who diet in ninth grade (around 15 years of age) are three times more likely than non-dieters to be overweight by 12th grade. But dieting is also the most important predictor for developing an eating disorder. Hence the academy\u2019s new one-size-fits-all guidelines. Wellness is the word preferred to weight. But wellness needs to be managed, too. Eating disorders can start with teenagers wanting to eat \u201chealthily\u201d and eliminate \u201cbad\u201d foods. This can slip into skipping meals and severely restricting foods. Likewise, exercise can become compulsive \u2013 especially after people praise teenagers for losing weight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/19/should-parents-comment-on-daughters-weight-diet\">Should parents ever comment on their daughter\u2019s weight?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what can you do to reduce the risk of eating disorders?

Ouch. So here, thanks to the academy, is that advice.</p> <h2><strong>The solution</strong><br></h2> <p>Don\u2019t talk about dieting with your child, but go big on healthy eating and more physical activity instead. Do not talk about weight \u2013 yours, theirs, anybody\u2019s. Encourage your teenagers to feel positive about their bodies \u2013 which is tough when half of teenage girls and a quarter of boys dislike their shape. But adolescents who are encouraged by parents and peers to exercise and eat healthily are happier with their bodies. Family dinners are also protective. A study of more than 13,000 pre-adolescents and adolescents found that having family dinners most days reduced the risk of eating disorders \u2013 parents can be role models for healthy eating, monitor their child\u2019s intake and have a chat.<br></p> <p>Never tease teenagers about weight. Up to 40% of girls are teased \u2013 it doubles the risk of being overweight and increases the risk of unhealthy dieting. <a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/bouve/directory/rachel-rodgers/\">Dr Rachel Rodgers</a>, associate professor at the department of applied psychology at Northeastern University in Boston, says families should try to protect teenagers from the emphasis society puts on appearance and weight. It is better to push a \u201ctotal diet\u201d \u2013 eat anything, but in varying quantities. Can these guidelines really prevent eating disorders?

A big part of that is a mourning or grief, a loss. A lot of the songs started on a piano, played late at night at one of our parents\u2019 houses, so there\u2019s the introspective aspect. Then we turned up the volume and created pop or rock songs. But there\u2019s a wistfulness at the core of the songwriting.\u201d </p> <p>The title of the album, which comes out this November, is a metaphor for being caught between the twin waves of adolescence and adulthood, and specifically about coming of age in an iconic city such as New York.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about how your relationship with a city can be like a relationship with a person,\u201d says Hill, who admits he was drawn to NYC via Woody Allen\u2019s bittersweet romances of the 70s. There is even a song on the album called Annie Hall, named after the eponymous heroine of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/annie-hall-comedy\">Allen\u2019s 1977 Oscar-winning </a>comedy. </p> <p>Still, where Allen\u2019s characters were often solipsists, even narcissists, Pavo Pavo are all about \u201cthe collective vision\u201d. \u201cSome bands focus on the bedroom genius narrative, but we\u2019re trying to subvert that and write songs that are stories telling collective narratives that have to do with the many personalities in the band,\u201d Hill says. \u201cThey\u2019re really about our friendships with each other, which is unusual for pop songs. They\u2019re love letters to each other.\u201d</p> <p>Hill grew up with classical musician parents before gravitating towards rock; these days, he moonlights as a string arranger, notably for Dirty Projectors. Eliza Bagg is, notes Hill, \u201clike the director of the film \u2013 she has an amazing aesthetic sensibility and vision.\u201d She also has, he laughs, \u201cthe power of veto \u2013 she decides whether something is right, every step of the way.\u201d Green is \u201cthe funny case\u201d who lives in LA and \u201cwas part of the recording process but doesn\u2019t play live with the band \u2013 his role is TBD.\u201d Romer is Hill\u2019s best friend; the pair grew up together in the same suburban town. \u201cHe\u2019s a totally essential piece of the puzzle \u2013 a lot of the harmonies are him.\u201d As for Vaughn, he\u2019s \u201ca very exciting drummer who\u2019s as wild offstage as he is on.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.drive.com.au/content/dam/images/g/j/0/h/v/m/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gizh2p.png/1440143789843.jpg\">Has he ever driven a Rolls Royce into a swimming pool?</a> \u201cNo, he has a 1991 Honda Accord.\u201d </p> <p>The sleeve of Young Narrator in the Breakers features two women, hand in hand, walking towards an unknown destination.

The songs range from the wonky Beach Boys of Wiserway to Ran Ran Run which sounds like TV on the Radio producing the Shirelles, Bagg\u2019s vocals all ghostly wisps. Some of it is folky and Fleet Foxes-ish, other parts are Flaming Lips-y and spacey. Sometimes they sound like both. The gadget fetishism never gets in the way of a good melody: the Aquarium is a lovely slow-motion drift; We\u2019ll Have Nothing Going on a lush, shimmery treat.

  "<p>The first public hint that Bungie was working on a new game \u2013 a new franchise \u2013 to follow its astonishing run of success with Halo, the iconic first person shooter, came in the form of an easter egg in its penultimate entry in that series, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/sep/28/halo3-odst-xbox-microsoft\">Halo 3: ODST</a>.</p> <p>It was 2009. At that point, development on the new game had barely started. The earliest work was concept art, ideas for characters and weapons showing a fusion of high fantasy swords-and-sorcery and post-Halo space opera. But Bungie already had a name, and a setting. It was enough for the teaser image, which showed the earth, flanked by an artificial moon. The caption: \u201cDestiny awaits.\u201d</p> <p>Seven years on, Bungie has rebuilt itself around Destiny. The walls of its huge open-plan studio in Bellevue in Washington state are still adorned with that early concept art, recognisable even after countless iterations as the first steps on a $500m journey to build a new type of console game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9f6dc0a64ce166f5395ec54772fa11b2cb866ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9f6dc0a64ce166f5395ec54772fa11b2cb866ea/23_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Halo: ODST Easter Egg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Halo: ODST Easter Egg</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bungie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in most aspects, the studio has changed almost as much as Destiny itself. After 10 years working on Halo, Bungie had to teach itself how to make a massively multiplayer game from scratch. It\u2019s a never-ending conundrum but two years into Destiny\u2019s projected decade-long lifespan, the team has got as far as anyone. At times, it has been rocky progress, but with the game\u2019s fourth expansion out in September and its first sequel following next year, Bungie has finally got the time to look back at how it all happened.</p> <h2><strong>Forethought</strong></h2> <p>\u201cWhen we made Halo 1, we didn\u2019t have a plan for Halo 3. It wasn\u2019t part of an intentional series of games. We were just doing our best to make an amazing game,\u201d says Jonty Barnes, Bungie\u2019s vice president of game development. \u201cAnd so we asked ourselves, \u2018Hey, what would we do differently if we knew that we were gonna create a franchise that would last over a decade? What lessons have we learned from Halo, so we don\u2019t paint ourselves into a corner? What would we want to do if we were to reinvent the Bungie shooter? And what did we want to hold on to that was super important to us?\u201d<br></p> <p>Barnes, an English expat who cut his teeth at influential developers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/20/lionhead-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-british-video-game-legend\">Lionhead</a> in the 1990s on games including cult classic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/11/dungeon-keeper-free-to-play-evil\">Dungeon Keeper</a> and AI trailblazer Black and White, now has responsibility for the strategic view at Bungie. While most of the staff are focused on specific projects, with some working on September\u2019s expansion Rise of Iron, and others focusing on next year\u2019s Destiny 2, he has the chance to take the longer view.</p> <p>\u201cWe believed that the core action game was the most important thing to hold on to in terms of Bungie\u2019s craft. Bungie has got a history of doing games that allow players to play together. While PvP [player versus player] on Halo was very competitive, we also had a lot of people playing cooperative Halo, and we felt like we hadn\u2019t tapped into that opportunity. We really wanted to lean into that very heavily with Destiny, and knew that that would create more opportunities for players to play together.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so we laid out a series of games, that was the 10-year plan. It would be disingenuous to say that\u2019s the same plan that we\u2019ve got today, but I will say, if you look at the original vision of the first release of Destiny and the goals that we set out, we kept to that clear vision of what we believed was important, and executed on it.\u201d</p> <p>It is true that Destiny hasn\u2019t had an easy ride to get where it is. On launch, the game was an odd mix of the extremely polished action that Bungie had developed a reputation for throughout its years on Halo, tied together with an overarching plot which, to put it kindly, made no sense. Narrative threads were introduced with little explanation, or dropped without resolution, while dialogue was corny at best (particular highlights included \u201cI don\u2019t have time to explain why I don\u2019t have time to explain\u201d and a bored-sounding Peter Dinklage, voicing the player\u2019s main companion, exclaiming \u201cThat wizard came from the moon!\u201d). A huge chunk of the game\u2019s formidable worldbuilding, meanwhile, was exiled to Bungie\u2019s website and the game\u2019s companion app, rendering it invisible to most players.</p> <p>In October 2015, <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731\">gaming site Kotaku revealed</a> that the game felt that way because it had been substantially rewritten in the run-up to launch. With just six months to go before the planned release, Bungie chiefs had decided that the story of Destiny just didn\u2019t work. \u201cThey decided it was too campy and linear,\u201d Kotaku\u2019s Jason Schreier wrote, \u201cand they quickly decided to scrap [the initial] version of the story and start from scratch.\u201d</p> <p>Two years on, though, the decision is starting to pay dividends. The story, Schreier wrote, wasn\u2019t just rewritten for tone, but also to make it less linear, allowing the game to be played in an order largely of the player\u2019s choosing; the same decision led to the introduction of the Director, the menu screen from which players pick what missions to play. By the launch of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/22/destiny-taken-king-review-finally-good-game\">The Taken King,</a> the third expansion pack for Destiny, which came out in September 2015, that flexibility was being used to offer alternative versions of missions, one-off challenges and special quest chains which could be played at multiple points in the story.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly obvious from the releases that we\u2019ve done since the first game that we want to improve our craft in storytelling,\u201d said Barnes. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress there: I think we didn\u2019t realise the potential of storytelling. Personally, I\u2019ve found Rise of Iron to be the most satisfying so far.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Slot machines</strong></h2> <p>Halo had shown that Bungie could do plot, even if Destiny at launch sparked some awkward questions about that. And there\u2019s never been any doubt that wonderfully tactile action and beautiful landscapes are the studio\u2019s greatest strengths. Talk about Bungie games for any length of time and someone will bring up the skyboxes \u2013 the vast, gorgeous scenery that sits on the edge of the game world, showing the rings of Halo curving up to infinity, or the towering spires of the Vex infestation on Venus rising out of the earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61fe3a65ad6035c11943162bd6f7c4429969fbc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61fe3a65ad6035c11943162bd6f7c4429969fbc0/84_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Halo 3\u2019s skyboxes, showing an unfinished Halo installation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Halo 3\u2019s skyboxes, showing an unfinished Halo installation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bungie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The director of Rise of Iron, Chris Barrett, got his start in the studio on the art team, and can still remember his last skybox, in Halo 2: \u201cit looked out over all of inside the Covenant ship, and it had a Forerunner thing in the middle\u2026 it\u2019s about being able to stand in the world and look around. We can make it feel like a painting, you know, we can extend the image beyond just the gameplay space into something bigger and grander. I think that\u2019s definitely something we\u2019ve always tried to do.\u201d</p> <p>Those strengths gave the basis for Destiny\u2019s success. But what no one, not even Bungie, knew is whether or not they could build a game that mixed that essence with the loot-collecting mechanics of a game like Diablo and the massively-multiplayer side of an RPG like World of Warcraft.</p> <p>Most frustrating to players was the fact that Bungie seemed to be repeating the mistakes of earlier games, blundering through the same process of trial and error rather than learning from those who came before. When the game launched, for instance, enemies dropped \u201cengrams\u201d: coloured baubles which could be opened to receive weapons and armour. The rarer the engram, the rarer the loot contained within \u2013 sometimes. Initially, the rarest engrams, dubbed legendary, would occasionally contain garbage. It was clearly intended to heighten the excitement of seeing what the engram contained, but felt to players like a slap in the face, as their glee at finding a rare item was ripped away from them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c906c7fe86dba4012f1057335047f2aa2c74a041\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c906c7fe86dba4012f1057335047f2aa2c74a041/0_6_995_597/500.png\" alt=\"Destiny\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screenshot from Destiny: Rise of Iron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bungie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similar problems abounded. The first raid \u2013 a co-op activity where a group of people team up online to take on massive enemies \u2013 which launched shortly after the game itself, dropped items which could only be upgraded by re-running the raid, tearing the dropped weapons apart, and using their pieces to upgrade the first items. Again, the intent was clear: offer players some compensation for earning duplicate weapons. But it also led to a deeply unsatisfying loop, where scoring a new piece of armour just meant more work earning the same item three or four times until you managed to gain enough resources to level it up so it was better than the old one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e817d45d8eaac3332c62c46d0bef6573e6f5039\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e817d45d8eaac3332c62c46d0bef6573e6f5039/0_18_1440_864/1000.png\" alt=\"A Hive Ogre in chains.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Hive Ogre in chains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bungie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou always can learn from prior art,\u201d agrees Barnes. He points out that Bungie weren\u2019t total novices to the area, with their fifth and final Halo game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/sep/12/halo-reach-xbox-360-game-review\">Reach</a>, having a fairly intricate progression system for player-versus-player combat. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen other games. We\u2019re avid gamers, you know: a lot of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/world-of-warcraft\"> World of Warcraft</a>. I mean, it\u2019s been around a long time. There\u2019s a lot of lessons to learn from that space.\u201d</p> <p>The Kotaku article detailing Destiny\u2019s early woes even claims explicit instruction was drawn from Warcraft creator Blizzard\u2019s 2009 game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/may/16/diablo-3-pc-game-review\">Diablo 3</a>, shortly after Destiny\u2019s initial release. Blizzard, who are part of the same corporate family as Destiny\u2019s publisher\u2019s Activision, went to Bellevue to share their own tale of launching a commercially successful but critically shaky game.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Bungie had to work out a system that worked for its own unique game. \u201cThe first version of the player progression was in Excel,\u201d Barnes says. \u201cJason [Jones, design lead] coded a whole bunch of algorithms and, you know, gear-to-player permutations to model, like, \u2018What would be the player experience after 30 minutes? What would be the player experience after five weeks? What would be the player experience after six months?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But spreadsheets couldn\u2019t predict every aspect of player behaviour. Most famously, the team failed to spot an exploit that became known as the \u201cloot cave\u201d: players, standing in a particular spot, could shoot at a never-ending stream of enemies, and collect astronomical quantities of gear in a short period of time. It was a funny quirk of an evolving game, and the cave has entered Destiny lore, but it was also fairly damning. After all, what did it say about the game that players would rather stand in the same place shooting bullets into a hole for hours on end than actually play the game as it was intended?</p> <p>The loot cave was easy to fix, but the broader problems of the in-game economy (killing enemies, getting guns, levelling up the guns to kill more enemies, to get more guns, etc) \u2013 what Barnes calls the \u201cinvestment game\u201d \u2013 took a while longer. Today, he says, \u201cit\u2019s wrong to say that the original investment game isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s just evolved. On the surface it\u2019s probably unrecognisable, but there\u2019s key systems that continue to persist.\u201d</p> <p>Barrett adds that the experience on Halo helped a lot. \u201cWe definitely have got a great foundation there, but the specifics of how the economy works or the drop rates or the mechanics of Nightfall (a particularly hard co-op mode) and things like that are something we\u2019re always looking at.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Tweak, tweak and tweak again.</strong></h2> <p>The story of the first two years of Destiny has been one of constant refinement. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that after we released the first game we were very anxious and very fast to make some changes to make improvements, because we learnt a great deal very quickly from being in the wild\u201d, Barnes says.</p> <p>Now, though, the pace of those changes should be declining. The team has learned what works and what doesn\u2019t \u2013 even if some of those lessons may have seemed obvious to gamers with a decade\u2019s experience on game such as World of Warcraft and Diablo. \u201cWe have a greater understanding of the game two years after the fact, and we don\u2019t have to make such reactionary changes,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cI\u2019m sure when we do a major release there will still be some major reaction that we\u2019re gonna want to participate [in], but I don\u2019t imagine it being on the same scale.\u201d</p> <p>Barrett feels that the team now has the breathing room to address the smaller issues, moving from firefighting to the polishing that distinguishes the best Bungie games from its competition. And, of course, more stuff. \u201cThere were some things that, once we have millions of people playing it, are easy to iron out. But I think the game is in a pretty solid state that way, and what players really want is more and more content.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFTn6jQk338\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EFTn6jQk338?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Rise of Iron Trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>With Rise of Iron, Destiny moves into a brief period of stability in its first phase of life. Following the third expansion, the Taken King, Bungie moved from a period of regular DLC packs to a more fluid schedule of live events, smaller updates and the occasional large expansion pack, and it has now settled into a rhythm that most players seem OK with \u2013 occasional content droughts notwithstanding.</p> <p>And then, in a year or so, it will start all over again. The existence of Destiny 2 has been confirmed, but little else is known about the game. One thing that is known, though, is that for once, Bungie has very few other examples to learn from. The number of successful MMO sequels can be counted on one hand, thanks to the inherent difficulties of the form: do you close the previous game? Can characters be carried over? How do new players enter on a level playing field if so? What do old players get for their years of service if not?</p> <p>Since the launch of Destiny, Bungie has grown into a machine built to answer these questions, and more. Six hundred people now work for the company, all with a single-minded focus on making more of Destiny. Over the equivalent period of Halo\u2019s lifespan, the company had gone from being a small Mac-focused games company to the jewel in the crown of Microsoft\u2019s console division. Who knows where it will be by the end of Destiny\u2019s run at the top?</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/22/destiny-taken-king-review-finally-good-game\"><strong>Destiny: The Taken King review: finally, the game it should have been</strong></a><br></li> </ul>",

Research suggests that up to 60% of consumers would pay more for environmentally or socially responsible products. Interestingly, the proportion of people who actually pay more for these products is significantly lower than those who say they will. I know of a leading American company that bases their investments on 15% of their target market paying more for a product with a positive sustainability story.

It\u2019s nudges, pokes, prompts, subtleties \u2013 and more nudges.</p> <p>The cold hard truth is that businesses will invariably want to explore any potential commercial benefit of more ethical operations, looking at opportunities to \u201csell\u201d sustainability either by charging a slight premium (\u201crenewable only\u201d energy tariffs) or by outcompeting a rival (two bars of chocolate at the same price, but one is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/fair-trade\" title=\"\">Fairtrade</a>).

He had spent eight months in prison for burglary, and 10 years on probation.</p> <p>The sperm bank had inadvertently included the donor\u2019s name, <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2016/06/07/bc-families-sue-sperm-bank-after-genius-donor-turns-out-to-be-felon-with-mental-health-issues\">Christian Aggeles</a>, in an email to the couple. A Google search did the rest. His stepfather had testified in court that Aggeles\u2019s psychotic episodes began aged 19, well before he started donating in Georgia. Aggeles\u2019s sperm led to the birth of at least 36 children worldwide.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like a dream turned nightmare in an instant,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2016/04/09/he-was-the-perfect-sperm-donor-then-26-families-found-out-he-wasnt.html\">said Collins</a>. The couple, alongside at least three other families, have filed lawsuits against the Georgia-based sperm bank, Xytex Corporation, which also supplied sperm to British couples. <a href=\"http://blog.xytex.com/an-open-letter/\">Xytex denies wrongdoing</a>.</p> <p>Such cases are not unique. Like Collins, Hanson and their son, many families and individuals are now coming to terms with vital information that their donors withheld.</p> <p>The ramifications of such discoveries can be immense. \u201cThe most important entity to me is [my son] potentially facing a very debilitating lifestyle,\u201d Collins says. \u201cI felt like I was duped by Xytex and I failed my son for having chosen Xytex. In hindsight, a hitchhiker on the side of the road would have been a far more responsible option for conceiving a child.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee090bc39f6b519c318bce0ed61259c6b10ee0ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee090bc39f6b519c318bce0ed61259c6b10ee0ca/0_296_5608_3365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xytex Corporation website\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Families have filed lawsuits against the Georgia-based sperm bank, Xytex Corporation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Goldman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What level of risk do Aggeles\u2019s genes confer? The architecture of mental health disorders is complex. The genetic component of schizophrenia, explains Professor Cathryn Lewis, professor of genetic epidemiology and statistics at King\u2019s College London, is not a single gene, but is combined across many genes. \u201cThere are likely to be thousands of inherited variants that control risk of schizophrenia. Each change slightly increases or decreases our risk, but none of them alone will enable us to predict whether someone is likely to develop schizophrenia.\u201d</p> <p>Even exciting new <a href=\"http://www.broadinstitute.org/news/7823\">findings in the C4 gene</a> require careful interpretation. \u201cIt\u2019s a single piece in a large genetic jigsaw puzzle,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cTesting one gene tells us nothing about an individual\u2019s risk of developing schizophrenia.\u201d</p> <p>Mental health conditions also reflect a mix of <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/hhhermh\">interacting environment and social factors</a>. Not to mention that many people with schizophrenia <a href=\"http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/178/6/506\">respond to treatment and live full, productive lives</a>.</p> <p>Donor anonymity was abolished in the UK in 2005. Donor-conceived offspring are now legally entitled, at the age of 18, to information on their donor\u2019s identity. However, this was not retrospectively applied: those conceived before April 2005 (that\u2019s 21,000 people born between 1991 and 2004 alone) cannot identify their donor unless the donor steps forward voluntarily. Some are never even told they were donor-conceived in the first place.</p> <p>Tyler Blackwell discovered as a teenager in Maryland that he has 35 half-siblings. His second surprise: having the same <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/sperm-donors-24-children-told-fatal-illness-medical/story?id=14115344\">condition that his donor father, John (not his real name) had not revealed</a>. John\u2019s sister found the Blackwells through a family ancestry site. It transpired that John, who had not replied to their correspondence, had an aortic aneurysm, which had ruptured at the age of 43. He had survived. At least three other family members were similarly affected. Tyler saw a cardiologist as a precaution, was diagnosed with an aneurysm and underwent surgery. Without an operation on an aneurysm of this type, the mortality from rupture is up to 97%. When rupture occurs, patients usually <a href=\"http://patient.info/doctor/thoracic-aortic-aneurysms\">die within six hours</a>. \u201cThere is no one who knew about it,\u201d said his mother of the sperm bank involved. \u201cIf I could foretell the future, I would have picked a different donor.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/01/sperm-donation-laws-can-lead-to-untold-heartache-for-both-donors-and-recipients\">Sperm donation laws can lead to untold heartache \u2013 for both donors and recipients | Margaret Ambrose</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Financial incentives could underlie some instances of deception. However, the UK\u2019s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority <a href=\"http://www.hfea.gov.uk/\">(HFEA)</a> sets the limit for sperm donors at \u00a335 per clinic visit and egg donors at \u00a3750 per cycle of donation, plus expenses. These limits, it states, aim to reward altruism and discourage coercion. Rules vary internationally. One California cryobank \u201creimburses your time and expenses with compensation of up to $1,500/month\u201d with \u201cperiodic incentives such as movie tickets or gift certificates for extra time and effort expended by participants\u201d.</p> <p>Danish sperm donor 7042 unwittingly <a href=\"http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_186023.asp\">passed on neurofibromatosis</a> to at least 11 of his children, after his sperm was used in clinics across the US, Canada, Belgium, Greece, Spain, Thailand and the UK. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1109/\">Neurofibromatosis</a> is associated with brain and nerve tumours, bone deformities, visual impairment, high blood pressure and learning difficulties. Offspring have a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1109/\">50% risk of inheriting it</a>. Denmark has since mandated that donor sperm can be used in a maximum of 12 inseminations. In the UK, no more than 10 families can be created using egg or sperm from a single donor. Donated eggs are not risk-free, but sperm donors usually have more offspring who can pass on inherited conditions to the next generation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a point where you have to draw the line, and say we\u2019re not creating designer babies here</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is no such thing as reproduction without risk. There is, however, an ethical responsibility towards the child to be conceived and their hopeful parents. If a donor develops a genetic condition years after donation, there is no system at present that enforces disclosure.</p> <p>Donors now must test negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis, with further screening informed by ethnicity \u2013 such as cystic fibrosis in those of Caucasian descent and sickle-cell disease in African and Afro-Caribbean populations. <a href=\"https://britishfertilitysociety.org.uk/press-release/new-guidelines-for-screening-of-sperm-egg-and-embryo-donors-in-the-uk/\">Guidelines</a> state that potential donors should be assessed for conditions with a genetic component \u2013 cleft palate, spina bifida, congenital heart malformations, psychosis and others \u2013 but that decisions on eligibility should be individualised.</p> <p>These screening regulations do not always apply to the unknown number of UK citizens who travel abroad to find donors, use unlicensed clinics or buy home-insemination kits online. Although psychological evaluation is required by most international authorities, this will not bar donors who have not yet developed symptoms of a serious mental health disorder. For them, the diagnostic tool is time.</p> <p>Genetic screening is more affordable and comprehensive than ever before. So, should we turn away from the donor\u2019s account and towards the laboratory? Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, is wary. \u201cI think the perfect genome probably doesn\u2019t exist, so it\u2019s really a question of where the line should be drawn. Only about 4% of men who come forward to be sperm donors are accepted. If we were to impose a whole new set of exclusion criteria based on theoretical risks, it is possible there won\u2019t be any sperm donors at all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"397c7812f7553fb56e0c1687a0b3ef49260087b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/397c7812f7553fb56e0c1687a0b3ef49260087b3/0_311_5086_3052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frozen sperm stored in a sperm bank\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frozen sperm stored in a sperm bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: monkeybusinessimages/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With enhanced screening, donors might be diagnosed with genetic conditions that would have remained undiscovered for ever, or are untreatable. Perhaps there is an argument for not knowing.</p> <p>Kevin, who works in photography in London, is not only a donor-conceived person but a donor himself. He believes that prospective parents should know as much as possible about the donor\u2019s medical history. \u201cBut there is a point where you have to draw the line, and say we\u2019re not creating designer babies here,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>He understands the distress of Elizabeth Hanson and Angela Collins, yet worries about reading too much into specific cases. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame if people let it overshadow the industry and take it to be some sort of wide-reaching corruption. It is one story. Every day there are lots of babies being born to couples who have fertility problems and that\u2019s much more important to remember.\u201d</p> <p>Eleven offspring have been born from his donations. Why did he donate? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if someone hadn\u2019t donated. Somebody did that and that\u2019s why I am here.\u201d</p> <p>Jess Cresswell discovered aged 28 that she was donor-conceived. Seven years later, she still does not know who her biological father is, but feels her parents gave her the best life they could. Since some of her own family medical history is missing, how does she feel about donor screening?</p> <p>\u201cI think they should be screened but I also think that, just because they have some sort of hereditary condition, they shouldn\u2019t necessarily be excluded. It\u2019s the parents\u2019 discretion; some people would rather have a child knowing there\u2019s a risk of picking something up than not, if that was their only option.\u201d</p> <p>It is now easier than ever for donor-conceived people to find their genetic family. The <a href=\"https://www.donorsiblingregistry.com/\">US Donor Sibling Registry</a> has helped connect more than 10,900 people with their half-siblings and/or their donors. Nearly 70% of those who sign up match with a biological relative, and almost 80% of this group match instantly. The UK has a <a href=\"http://www.hfea.gov.uk/donor-sibling-link.html\">Donor Sibling Link site</a>.</p> <p>Direct-to-consumer genetic tests have revolutionised this space. In 2005, a 15-year-old sent a saliva sample to an online service, had his genetic code uploaded, used a tracking website and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/nov/03/genetics.news. FamilyTreeDNA\">met his biological father 10 days later</a>. Kevin found a half-sister through a donor-sibling registry and two half-siblings through ancestry sites. He later inadvertently discovered some of his donor\u2019s details. Two hours on, Google revealed his donor\u2019s name. The two have since stayed in contact.</p> <p>One last thing: Aggeles received mental health treatment and picked up a degree in cognitive science two decades after he first registered at university. He is now working on a master\u2019s in artificial intelligence.</p>",

At least nine seats have changed hands and there remain six undecided but the overall result is clear \u2013 the Labor party won resoundingly with at least 15 seats in the 25-seat parliament.</p> <p>The CLP will be lucky to hold three, which means it\u2019s likely there will be more independents than official opposition members. The chief minister-elect, Michael Gunner, has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/28/northern-territory-michael-gunner-seeks-urgent-briefing-on-juvenile-detention\">his government will look at the financial mechanisms</a> to ensure all non-Labor MLAs receive adequate resources.</p> <p>Successful CLP candidate Lia Finocchiaro and ex-CLP turned independent speaker Kezia Purick have both said they will work with independents to be an effective opposition.

Francis Xavier Kurrupuwu had held the seat, which encompassed the Tiwi Islands and Western Arnhem Land for the past term.</p> <p>Kurrupuwu suffered less than half the swing against him than the CLP average but it wasn\u2019t enough and, with less than half the votes counted, it appeared Labor\u2019s Lawrence Costa would win. </p> <p>Costa, who has Tiwi heritage, lives on his Pitjarmirra outstation on Melville Island. He is the former chief executive of the Tiwi Islands local government and was most recently a health service development officer.</p> <h2>Arnhem</h2> <p>Larisa Lee, the incumbent independent member who since the 2012 election had quit the Palmer United party which she\u2019d joined after quitting the CLP, suffered one of the biggest defeats on Saturday, with just 60 primary votes in her favour with 46% counted.</p> <p>Elected Labor member Selena Uibo is an award-winning educator who has taught in her mother\u2019s homeland community of Numbulwar since 2012. Uibo has previously spoken about <a href=\"https://www.womeninfocus.com.au/t5/Community-Stories/Selena-Uibo-Change-through-education-in-Numbulwar-NT/ba-p/1843\">a \u201cglass ceiling\u201d effect in remote communities</a>, which sees managerial roles go to non-local people. </p> <h2>Brennan</h2> <p>Incumbent MLA Peter Chandler had largely avoided implication in the series of scandals that rocked the CLP government over the past four years. However, he too lost his (previously very safe) Palmerston seat, suffering a swing against him in line with that against the party.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s Tony Sievert will leave his job with the health department to become the member for Brennan and has previously worked as a corrections officer and in youth and community services.</p> <h2>Drysdale</h2> <p>Drysdale is another formerly very safe CLP seat to fall in Palmerston. It was previously held by Lia Finocchiaro, who was preselected for the new seat of Spillet and was the only CLP candidate to hold on during Saturday\u2019s whitewash.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s Eva Lawler is a former bureaucrat in the Department of Sport and Recreation and the education department. She is also a former educator. In the previous Labor government Lawler was a senior adviser to Marion Scrymgour, the NT education minister who introduced the controversial policy dictating the first four hours of school in Indigenous communities must be taught in English.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labor\u2019s deputy chief minister, Lynne Walker, could be the only Labor incumbent to lose</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Fong Lim</h2> <p>The Darwin seat of Fong Lim did not suffer as big a swing against it as some other CLP strongholds, contested by all new faces. David Tollner, the controversial incumbent who featured heavily among the CLP scandals of the past four years, sought but failed to gain preselection in the new electorate of Spillet and was left with no seat to stand for.</p> <p>His replacement, Tim Dixon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/clp-candidate-wont-support-plans-to-normalise-darwin-aboriginal-community\">distanced himself from some of Tollner\u2019s more divisive policies</a> during the campaign but, with about half the ballots counted, he had lost the seat with about 41% of the two-party preferred vote. It was also contested by two high-profile independents.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s Jeff Collins is a Darwin-based lawyer, councillor for the Law Society NT and member of the human rights committee for the Law Council of Australia. Collins and his family moved to the Northern Territory from Sydney in 2012.</p> <h2>Namatjira</h2> <p>Controversial figure Alison Anderson retired at the election, having represented the central desert seat of Namatjira as an independent after quitting the Palmer United party, and before that the CLP, with Larisa Lee.</p> <p>Despite her political affiliations, Anderson threw her support behind the Labor candidates in Namatjira and neighbouring Stuart, and the CLP saw a whopping swing of more than 34% against it with almost half the votes counted.</p> <p>Incoming Labor member Chansey Paech counts himself as a fifth-generation Centralian and was elected to the Alice Springs council in 2012. He has previously campaigned for youth services in the desert town to assist the high number of kids at risk.</p> <h2>Port Darwin</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/27/its-a-thumping-labor-wins-northern-territory-election\">'It's a thumping': Labor wins Northern Territory election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another inner Darwin seat vacated by a controversial minister. Attorney general John Elferink\u2019s announcement of his retirement in November was this year followed by the broadcast of Four Corners\u2019 episode on juvenile detention. Elferink was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/27/adam-giles-praises-john-elferink-despite-northern-territory-detention-scandal\">stripped of two portfolios</a> and remained largely away from public view for the remainder of the campaign, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/jul/26/northern-territory-juvenile-detention-reaction-royal-commission-footage-four-corners-tear-gas-restraint-live?page=with%3Ablock-5796b7fce4b01845934fe72e\">reported death threats</a> against his family. His CLP replacement candidate, Rohan Kelly, had worked in education supporting children with special needs, and in the department of infrastructure. With two thirds of the vote counted, Kelly saw a 12.8% swing against him and he lost to Labor candidate Paul Kirby.</p> <p>Kirby is the Northern Territory organiser for the Electrical Trades Union and came up against the economy-driving Inpex resource project in a dispute over retrenchments that went before the Fair Work Commission.</p> <h2>Sanderson</h2> <p>The most recent deputy chief minister, Peter Styles, had hoped his local work for his suburban Darwin seat of Sanderson over two consecutive terms might save him but, with a 14.3% swing after a third of votes counted, Labor\u2019s candidate, Kate Worden, took the seat.</p> <p>Worden has been a Northern Territory public servant since 1995, working in government departments including mines, education, health, consumer affairs and, most recently, housing, where she oversaw complaints and compliance. During the campaign Worden spruiked Labor\u2019s commitment to increase government contracts with NGOs to five years in order to reduce red tape and staff turnover, and improve long-term planning capabilities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1baecaf9b74b4e83f3022be2754cb867f98ec60b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1baecaf9b74b4e83f3022be2754cb867f98ec60b/0_0_4935_2776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott McConnell, former ALP member Karl Hampton, traditional owner Conrad Ratara and ALP campaigner Robin Granites at the Northern Territory ALP victory celebrations in Alice Springs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott McConnell, former ALP member Karl Hampton, traditional owner Conrad Ratara and ALP campaigner Robin Granites at the Northern Territory ALP victory celebrations in Alice Springs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grenville Turner/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Stuart</h2> <p>Incumbent CLP member and Warlpiri woman Bess Price is predicted to have lost her central Australia seat of Stuart. There are a number of factors being considered, including the general swing against the CLP but also the redistribution of the electorates, which saw Stuart gain areas traditionally supportive of Alison Anderson \u2013 a powerful Indigenous politician who supported the Labor candidate, Scott McConnell, after she announced her retirement a few weeks ago. Price accused Anderson and McConnell of telling voters \u201cwe will give you grog and Bess will take it away\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-17/nt-election-confusion-accusations-fly-at-remote-polling-station/7760476\">a charge Anderson denied.</a></p> <p>Alice Springs-born McConnell is a former park ranger and the former head of the Ingkerreke Outstation Service and Ngurratjuta/Pmara Ntjarra Aboriginal Corporation.</p>",
  "<p>Hello guzzlers,</p> <p>Today\u2019s puzzle comes courtesy of Jelmer Steenhuis, a legendary Dutch puzzle designer. It\u2019s a contemporary twist on riddle that has been around since medieval times, and may be of use to revellers out partying today.</p> <blockquote> <p>Three friends set off to carnival with a jerry can containing 1.2litres of rum punch. On arrival they decide to go to three separate sound systems. So they must divide the booze equally between themselves. They have brought two large bottles for this purpose. But then they discover that these bottles have no measurements on them.</p> <p>One of the friends spots an empty 50cl can of Red Stripe and an empty 15cl vial of something marked \u2018rave juice\u2019 on the ground. There\u2019s a water tap on hand to clean the can and the vial.</p> <p>The friends are able to divide the punch into three equal portions by pouring between the jerry can, the two bottles, the beer can and the vial.</p> <p><em>How do they do it?</em></p> <p>Remember that the only measurements they have are for a full can and a full vial, but they also know there is 1.2litres of rum punch in the jerry can to start with.

The Extremely Young Victoria, let\u2019s hope, starring a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gogglesprogs\" title=\"\">Gogglesprog</a>. And then In Vitro Victoria, in which the heroine will be played by a grownup swimming in amniotic fluid in a repurposed burkini that the costume department have borrowed from armed cops who removed it from women on French beaches. Failing that, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/laura-trott\" title=\"\">Laura Trott\u2019s used omnium outfit</a>.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/firstlook/victoria\" title=\"\"><strong>Victoria</strong></a> (ITV), Coleman wakes up one morning to discover she isn\u2019t time-travelling in the Tardis with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peter-capaldi\" title=\"\">Peter Capaldi</a> any more. Instead, it\u2019s 1837 and she is poised to become the queen following (sad face) the death of her uncle, the king. I don\u2019t know who Coleman\u2019s agent is, but this kind of brilliant career move suggests they aren\u2019t getting paid enough.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t all sunshine and lollipops in 1837. The servants nick anything from the palace that isn\u2019t nailed down. The tsar\u2019s emissary thinks it\u2019s OK to grope Her Majesty at the coronation ball. Which it isn\u2019t. The CGI is just terrible. Victoria\u2019s mother is not just German but dim and in thrall to a courtier with a constipated face (Paul Rhys, superb as the pantomime villain). Her uncle wants to bump her off and become king. Few royal watchers think the 18-year-old is fit for purpose, which is understandable given that the carpenters have made the thrones six inches too tall, so her feet dangle ridiculously.</p> <p>Only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rufus-sewell\" title=\"\">Rufus Sewell</a>, as Lord Melbourne, the prime minister, believes the new queen has what it takes to front the imperial operation that will subjugate much of the world\u2019s landmass under British rule. I\u2019ve long followed Sewell\u2019s career with interest. He was the smouldering Byronic Will Ladislaw in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108858/\" title=\"\">Middlemarch</a>. Then he was the smouldering Nazi in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740299/\" title=\"\">The Man in the High Castle</a>. Here he\u2019s a middle-aged prime minister whose years of smouldering have apparently taken their toll. Hitherto world-weary after his son\u2019s death and his late wife\u2019s dalliance with Lord Byron, Melbourne finds, in Coleman\u2019s artless queen, a reason to live, while she finds a surrogate father and mentor. Naturally, public opinion assumes Vicky and Lord M are getting it on, which they\u2019re not. Or maybe they are? You can\u2019t rule out the possibility. I\u2019m just saying.</p> <p>No matter. He makes her realise that as she is queen, she can do anything \u2013 even change her name. And so she does. \u201cI do not like the name Alexandrina,\u201d she tells Melbourne. \u201cFrom now on I want to be called \u2026\u201d She pauses for effect: \u201c\u2026 Stacey.\u201d Only kidding. She renames herself Victoria. Which, at the time, was totally radical. Now, not&#xa0;so much.</p> <p>But, just then, overcome with paranoia, the new queen orders royal doctors to check whether Lady Flora Hastings, a seemingly turncoat maid of honour, is really pregnant by Rhys\u2019s evil courtier or has been stuffing palace pillows up the proverbial jumper. In fact, Lady Flora\u2019s bump is a tumour and she is dying of cancer. What\u2019s more, she is <em>virgo intacta</em>, reports the doctor.&#xa0;\u201cBut is she with child?\u201d asks Victoria, clearly not the brightest candle in the palace. \u201cThe one usually precludes the other,\u201d counsels Melbourne. Chastened by her misstep (ordering gynaecological probing of a dying woman on a dimwit hunch? So wrong, not to mention unsisterly), Victoria realises \u2013 or so you would hope \u2013 that she should wield power with more wisdom in future.</p> <p>And so Coleman becomes our queen. She clearly has what it takes. The last shot shows Victoria fulfilling her regal duty, sitting at a&#xa0;desk signing documents she doesn\u2019t bother to read. Our constitutional monarchy is such a beautiful thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f21b440796a86f9c040e0726a795b752c6dfff2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f21b440796a86f9c040e0726a795b752c6dfff2b/750_311_2856_1714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mrs Slocombe (Sherrie Hewson) and Miss Brahms (Niky Wardley) in Are You Being Served?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mrs Slocombe (Sherrie Hewson) and Miss Brahms (Niky Wardley) in Are You Being Served?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Kershaw/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her lingerie lampooned, her randiness ridiculed, her sexuality impugned \u2013 hasn\u2019t Mrs Slocombe suffered enough? Clearly not. In Derren Litten\u2019s spirited one-off homage to the 40-year-old sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/23/keeping-up-appearances-are-you-being-served-porridge-till-death-us-do-part-return-bbc-sitcom-season\" title=\"\"><strong>Are You Being Served?</strong></a> (BBC1), she was brought back to life to suffer again.</p> <p>Sherrie Hewson gamely played the pink-wigged battleaxe as she returned to her workstation covered in sewage, the result of a blockage caused by her \u201cintimate lady wipes\u201d. But she wasn\u2019t the only victim. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a&#xa0;whole bottle of Vosene to clean my pussy.\u201d So nice (ironic face) to have Mrs Slocombe\u2019s pussy back.</p> <p>In the past, I would have dismissed Are You Being Served? as misogynistic and homophobic. Like Operation Yewtree, it exposed so much that was wrong about the 1970s \u2013 not least in its cruel depiction of a middle-aged woman whom we laugh at in her tragicomic attempts to get some action, and a closeted gay man living with his mum. Litten, sensibly, didn\u2019t airbrush the show, but fondly disinterred its double entendres. Deck covered in seamen? Check. Mrs Slocombe clutching Jimmy Connors\u2019 balls? Check. Taking Miss Brahms up the Regal? Check.</p> <p>Thank heavens it\u2019s only a one-off, though: a&#xa0;little of Mr Humphries (Jason Watkins) mincing in his mother\u2019s kitten heels goes a long way. In the second of last night\u2019s double-bill of 70s retreads, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais gently imagined how the grandson of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/04/broadcasting.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Ronnie Barker\u2019s old lag</a> would fare in the slammer.

Happily, though, tinned pineapple remains the leading carceral currency.</p> <p>But the BBC missed a trick. Instead of recommissioning Are You Being Served? and Porridge, they should have remade the notorious 70s sitcom <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068096/\" title=\"\">Love Thy Neighbour</a>. If only they would commission an episode set in 2016, featuring a cultural clash, not between black and white families, but between benefit-cosseted Brits (I\u2019m thinking Wayne and Waynetta Slob redux) and hard-working, gorgeous east European immigrants (played by Milla Jovovich and Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107) next door, furious at the EU referendum result.

It shares a similar philosophy with those experiences, characterised by abstract worlds and pioneering storytelling.</p> <p><em>Bound</em> opens unlike any other video game, with a pregnant woman walking along a beach ruminating on her youth via her childhood drawing book. Her memories unfold in a beautifully fragmented way, with each page presenting a new abstract world. Mechanically, it requires the negotiation of an imaginative yet relatively stress-free 3D platform puzzle game that plays with space and gravity. There isn\u2019t any combat, but hazards must be avoided through beautifully choreographed, balletic dance moves, and though the game is short-lived, speed running is encouraged for replayability. Striking, unique and highly recommended for&nbsp;anyone looking for new experiences in gaming. <strong>RH</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"886fddfdb81f056ed930873fb5b11c544f4509fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/886fddfdb81f056ed930873fb5b11c544f4509fe/151_54_1709_1026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fired up: The King of Fighters XIV.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fired up: The King of Fighters XIV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.deepsilver.com/en/games/the-king-of-fighters-xiv/\" title=\"\"><strong>The King of Fighters XIV</strong></a></h2> <p>PS4, Deep Silver, cert: 12<br>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <p>SNK\u2019s celebrated three-on-three fighting game suffered from a shaky debut, with numerous critics lambasting the \u201clast-gen\u201d graphics seen in early trailers.&nbsp;It\u2019s fair to say that this first 3D entry in the mainline series (<em>Maximum&nbsp;Impact</em> should be ignored) is&nbsp;hardly cutting edge, but the engine has&nbsp;undergone significant work and has&nbsp;blossomed into a respectable-looking&nbsp;title.</p> <p>Traditional modes are all present and correct, with story, missions, galleries and a robust online feature set, and considering that <em>KoF XIV</em> doesn\u2019t use any of the previous games\u2019 assets, its roster of 50 characters (15 of which are brand new designs) is a welcome surprise.

  "<p><em>Commonwealth</em> is an outstanding novel by Ann Patchett \u2013 winner of the Orange prize for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/14/fiction.reviews1\" title=\"\"><em>Bel Canto</em></a> and author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/state-of-wonder.html\" title=\"\"><em>State of Wonder</em></a> \u2013 in which two family trees intertwine. It is a story in which nothing is a given and graftings do not always take. Every extended family is happy \u2013 and unhappy \u2013 in its own way. The opening is a show stopper \u2013 an overview of a christening party. To write about any party, you need to be a multitasker. Virginia Woolf and Ernest Hemingway are literature\u2019s showiest party-throwers but this Californian party has form too. Patchett is light, incisive and all-seeing. She keeps dialogue to a minimum and lets actions speak for themselves.</p> <p>Fix Keating, a cop, is married to a great beauty, the uncalculatedly seductive Beverly: \u201cStrands of yellow hair had come loose from her French twist and were falling into her eyes.\u201d Her baby, for whom the party is ostensibly being thrown, is named Frances. We will get to know \u201cFranny\u201d as she and the novel grow up. But our initial focus is on Bert Cousins, deputy district attorney, who gatecrashes the party because of his need to escape the tedium of toddlers and his tired wife, Teresa, on a Sunday afternoon. The irony of his escaping family life for a christening party needs no underscoring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jun/27/has-ann-patchett-picked-the-best-75-books-of-the-past-75-years\">Has Ann Patchett picked the best 75 books of the past 75 years?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bert finds himself in a suburban Eden where thirst is quenched by gin and oranges (in lieu of Eve\u2019s apple). The fact that Bert should not, by rights, be at the party at all is a further ironic twist of the orange juicer. Patchett is a pleasure to read: there is a no-fuss casualness to the prose that is only possible when a writer is in control of every word and she is master of her art.</p> <p>When Bert finds himself impulsively kissing Beverly, what neither of them knows is that this is the beginning of the end of their first marriages. Months later, Teresa will gather that she is not to have custody of her children in summer and will feel (though she loves her children keenly) that she has been \u201chanded the divorce equivalent of a Caribbean vacation\u201d. A further irony \u2013 or is it boomeranging karma? \u2013 is that Bob\u2019s initial toddler-dodging will lead to his seeing more of his own offspring than ever before. Patchett explores, with wry sympathy, the fallout from one, lustful gin-stoked encounter and its far-flung consequences over the decades.</p> <p>During long summers of neglect, the stepchildren hang out and conspire. Some of the children are more dysfunctional than others. One unsupervised day, they find gin and a gun in the glove compartment of Bert\u2019s car and set off to a lake. Cal, the eldest of Bert\u2019s children, is stung by a bee \u2013 a small event with colossal consequences. But Patchett has an even bigger idea waiting to take hold and make this already gripping novel even more compelling. She asks: what happens when real life is exploited in fiction? It is a fascinating question to pose within a novel. For who knows what \u2013 or whom \u2013 her own fiction might be exploiting as she writes (we have no means of telling). Franny, as an adult, has become a Chicago cocktail waitress, having given up her study of law. Her two criteria: \u201cnot to be a lawyer and to keep her clothes on\u201d. The second of these resolves has to be scrapped when she falls in love with Leon Posen, a famous American writer, \u201csomewhere in the dark woods past 50\u201d. He is amusingly and plausibly conjured: singular, quirky and self-deprecating.</p> <p>After Leon and Franny become lovers, she tells him about her dysfunctional siblings and he helps himself to all of it in a novel that then becomes a huge hit. Literary people do not come out of this novel well. There is a hugely entertaining account of how Frances unwittingly becomes Leon\u2019s unpaid housekeeper as writers come and go from their rented summer villa: narcissistic, ghastly, unappreciative spongers who never lift a finger to help and yet launch conversations beginning: \u201cWhy reprint Chekhov\u2026 \u201d while helping themselves to the herbed chicken breast Franny has slavishly produced, before continuing: \u201cWhy not have the courage to publish some young Russian writers instead?\u201d</p> <p>It is only when Albie, the most disturbed of Bert\u2019s sons, finds out that his life has been hijacked and used in a novel that the plot thickens and irredeemably curdles. What is so skilful is the way that Patchett makes no moral judgments. She shows but does not tell. She never preaches. She lets readers reflect on what is involved in stealing from life: emotional copyright is, in this unpushy and brilliant novel, more powerful than anyone dared suppose.</p> <p><em>Commonwealth is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a318.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/commonwealth-428573.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a315.57</em></a></p>",

Turnbull is dividing supporters of marriage equality over the process \u2013 plebiscite vs. parliamentary vote.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the difference: Howard was not a republican. It\u2019s hard to judge him too harshly. A scorpion does what a scorpion does. A politician using political tactics to defeat his political opponents is not new.</p> <p>But Turnbull tells us he is in favour of marriage equality. Yet now that he is the prime minister he\u2019s using Howard\u2019s tactics with little thought for the consequences. No one \u2013 including Turnbull \u2013 should be surprised when marriage equality ends up in the same place as a republic: defeated at the ballot box in a plebiscite and off the agenda for years.</p> <p>This is most likely exactly what certain Coalition MPs had in mind when proposing a plebiscite on same sex marriage.</p> <p>Turnbull is all over the shop when it comes to relying on a public vote to deliver significant legal and social change. On the one hand, he is incredibly alive to challenges: publicly and in conversations with the Referendum Council advising on constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians, Turnbull is constantly reminding that success is difficult and should not be taken for granted. <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/fairfaxipsos-poll-85pc-of-voters-back-indigenous-recognition-20150705-gi5jpi\">Polls</a> indicate that upwards of 85% Australians support constitutional recognition \u2013 and yet Turnbull is rightly quite concerned that Australia only holds a referendum if and when it can succeed.</p> <p>As Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHAys0HnLP0\">says</a>, the only successful referendums have been ones that were \u201cuncontroversial and had little to no opposition.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, Turnbull seems an absolute Pollyanna when it comes to a same sex marriage plebiscite \u2013 despite the fact that the issue is controversial and does have opposition. On Sunday he <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/insiders/content/2016/s4528077.htm\">told</a> the ABC Insiders program: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no question that the fastest way, the way you guarantee that there is a vote in the parliament on gay marriage \u2013 in this parliament \u2013 is to support the plebiscite. Personally I have no doubt the plebiscite will be carried, and the same sex marriage legislation will sail through the parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>Technically speaking, the fastest way to guarantee a vote in the parliament on gay marriage is if the prime minister brought forward a bill on the subject and let his party room have a free vote. No plebiscite is needed to give the parliament permission to have a vote.</p> <p>I have previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/25/a-plebiscite-on-same-sex-marriage-might-kick-our-politicians-into-action\">supported</a> a plebiscite, if for no other reason than there seemed to be no other way to advance the cause.</p> <p>But the longer the debate drags on, the more difficult it becomes. If anything, look at the campaign for constitutional recognition. It\u2019s an initiative that\u2019s been formally underway for nearly a decade: expert panels, Senate reports, a <a href=\"http://www.recognise.org.au/\">taxpayer-funded campaign</a> and now <a href=\"https://www.dpmc.gov.au/indigenous-affairs/constitutional-recognition/referendum-council\">a Referendum Council</a> (of which I am a member). Yet the longer it takes the more out of reach the goal seems. Expectations are raised and frustrated, opposition becomes entrenched, and events overtake the original idea.</p> <p>If we\u2019d had a marriage equality plebiscite within a year of Tony Abbott\u2019s original proposal, I think there would have been less angst and fear, more hope and momentum, and (maybe) more civility. But now the issue is growing more politically charged and the same infections that beset constitutional recognition \u2013 expectations, fear, weariness, anger and other events \u2013 risk contaminating the debate on marriage equality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/marriage-equality-plebiscite-i-take-this-barrage-of-bigotry-dressed-up-as-debate-personally\">Marriage equality plebiscite: I take this barrage of bigotry dressed up as 'debate' personally | Kerryn Phelps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull, of all people, should not be so sanguine about succeeding with a \u201cyes\u201d vote at a marriage equality plebiscite. There\u2019s a lot of support for same sex marriage, but there\u2019s a soft middle in that support that will be vulnerable to a \u201cno\u201d campaign. Some people may not be fussed if same sex couples marry, but those same people might not be fussed enough to rouse themselves on a Saturday to go vote for it \u2013 especially if their vote isn\u2019t binding on MPs.

Since 2004, WA\u2019s per capita overdose deaths have risen from the lowest to the highest in the country, a 222% increase.</p> <p>The national increase over the same period was 37%.</p>",

How widespread instances of illegal and unethical behaviour are within Australia\u2019s financial services industry<br></p> <p>2. How Australia\u2019s financial services institutions treat their duty of care to their customers<br></p> <p>3. How the culture, ethical standards and business structures of Australian financial services institutions affect the behaviour of these institutions<br></p> <p>4. Whether Australia\u2019s regulators are really equipped to identify and prevent illegal and unethical behaviour<br></p> <p>5. Comparable international experience with similar financial services industry misconduct and best practice responses to those incidents<br></p> <p>6.

All it can do is inquire and report. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cA royal commission, established with the very wide terms of reference \u2026 would run for many years, cost hundreds of millions of dollars and at its conclusion present a report.

It would delay justice for those who urgently need it.\u201d<br></p> <p>He also suggested Shorten should appoint some of Labor\u2019s keenest minds to the House of Representatives economics committee that will eventually compel chief executives of the major banks\u2019 to answer questions about interest rates and bank behaviour.</p> <p>Turnbull created the new rules for the committee  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/04/shorten-royal-commission-banks-respect-goverment\">after outrage over the banks\u2019 recent decision</a> not to pass on Reserve Bank\u2019s recent rate cut in full.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/scott-morrison-says-banking-industry-needs-a-culture-shift-not-an-inquiry\">Scott Morrison says banking industry needs a culture shift, not an inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the government was frustrated by the banks\u2019 failure to pass on the interest rate cut and needed to do practical things to increase transparency.</p> <p>In his letter to Turnbull, Shorten criticised the prime minister\u2019s response to the scandals plaguing the banking industry.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to restore trust in our banking and financial system,\u201d Shorten said in his letter. \u201cYour piecemeal approach is doing the exact opposite.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>When Meg was 12, her mother, Annie, found herself unable to look at her. Seeing her daughter made Annie feel unsettled, at times almost angry. At first, she couldn\u2019t figure out why. </p> <p> \u201cAnd then, Meg turned 13 and suddenly, everything slid into place for me,\u201d Annie says. </p> <p>\u201cI found myself thinking, \u2018She\u2019s so tiny.

It was something big and ugly, and it just broke.\u201d</p> <p> Annie was 13 in 1987 when an Anglican priest began sexually abusing her, over a period of eight to 10 months. Seeing her daughter turn the same age was a trigger that not only bring back memories of the abuse, but that also helped her to comprehend just how small and innocent she would have been. </p> <p>He was in his mid 30s, and used Annie\u2019s vulnerability after the acrimonious divorce of her parents and his knowledge that she had been sexually abused by a family member to his advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6f7f82994f65d74791a0e463fce71bedc9e6d98e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f7f82994f65d74791a0e463fce71bedc9e6d98e/0_0_2136_2836/753.jpg\" alt=\"Annie, who was abused for many years as a child from 1979 onwards by a priest.

But it is the experience of her family members she wants to highlight. They are the secondary victims, whose stories are often lost.</p> <p>Annie and her family believe abuse pervades the lives of secondary victims but support for them is haphazard and scarce. They hope that by sharing their experiences, religious and other institutions will do more to recognise and address the impact of abuse beyond the primary victim. </p> <p>Meg said at first she was unsure why her mother had begun to treat her differently. She did not know the extent of her mother\u2019s abuse at the time.</p> <p>\u201cI guess it was always obvious that something had happened to Mum, because sometimes she would cry or blank out but I didn\u2019t know exactly what she was upset about,\u201d Meg, now 14, says.</p> <p>\u201cBut when I first turned 13 that\u2019s kind of when I knew something more was going on. For a while though, I thought I\u2019d just done something wrong, I thought I\u2019d upset Mum in some way and that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t really talk to me any more.\u201d </p> <h2>Robbed of a childhood</h2> <p>Annie was first raped when the priest lured her alone into the church where he preached. Knowing that Annie was devastated about the death of her dog, the priest told her that if she looked toward the altar and prayed to God, she would see her beloved pet again. He made her lean towards the pew and, as she did, he pulled down her underwear and sexually abused her.</p> <p>Annie\u2019s police statement was made last year, when she was 42. </p> <p> \u201cAfter I got home there was a lot of blood there and it hurt for a while,\u201d it said. \u201cFor around two weeks, I remember I had a lot of trouble going to the toilet.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/australia-fails-the-same-lesson-every-time-the-nauru-files-show-how-secrecy-hides-abuse\">Australia fails the same lesson every time. The Nauru files show how secrecy hides abuse | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Annie recalls the priest raping her five times. She is unsure why the abuse eventually stopped. But it she says it robbed her of her childhood and left her without an identity, unable to accept love, her victim impact statement said. </p> <p>By the time she was in year 12, Annie had a nervous breakdown. Her former high marks at school crashed. Her mother threw her out of home for several weeks, forcing Annie to steal food from garbage bins to survive. </p> <p>When her mother accepted her back home, Annie was terrified of starving again, and began to eat as much as she could and to hide food in her bedroom. Between 1991 and 1992, Annie gained 30kg. </p> <p>In 1994 Annie\u2019s mother made her talk about her withdrawn and surly behaviour to a bishop her mother was friends with.<strong> </strong></p> <p> Annie brought up the name of her perpetrator to the bishop. He told her: \u201cI\u2019m going to stop you here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you to think very carefully about coming forward with this,\u201d Annie recalls him telling her. \u201cThink of the lives that could be ruined by this.\u201d </p> <p>The bishop questioned Annie\u2019s memory of what happened and told her that if she told anyone else, people would think she wanted it, that she was partly responsible. </p> <p>Letters written by church officials at the time and seen by Guardian Australia reveal that senior members of the church knew of the priest\u2019s abusing but did nothing.</p> <p>Annie\u2019s mother called her a slut and a whore. She accused her daughter of breaking up the family by causing trouble.<strong> </strong>Though she was awarded a scholarship to attend a prestigious college in 1994, Annie dropped out after less than a year. That same year, when she was 21, she tried to take her life. </p> <p>She has since worked in low-level jobs where people half her age serve as her boss. She cannot go near churches, even for funerals or weddings. She dreads sleep because of the nightmares she knows will come. She has considered and attempted suicide more than once.<br></p> <p>Annie\u2019s husband, Mark, and her three children, Robert,Meg,and Ella, do not know the full extent of her abuse, though they know most of the crucial details.

They protected them, they covered up their crimes, and they were often not held to account, and that\u2019s something that really upsets secondary victims.

He learned about the abuse of his mother just before Christmas, after he had finished his year 10 exams. Annie and Mark had been talking to detectives and representatives from the Anglican church and they felt it was time Robert knew what was going on. He is angered most by the fact that no one had helped his mother.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost worse, not helping when you can see something is wrong,\u201d Robert says. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that if you see or know about something wrong you have to do something. If you hide something like this happening to someone it\u2019s wrong.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThey [the church] should also know that the effect isn\u2019t just on that one person. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a web. Like a spider that keeps on building its web, things like this just keep building. I\u2019m not the only one who has been affected, my friends have, too, even if they don\u2019t know it, because they see how I am affected. They don\u2019t know what the cause is, and they won\u2019t for a while. But they see something is wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Robert says he feels angry that he cannot always talk about the problem with friends or adults who \u201cthink the world is safe and simple\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not. Because sometimes I come home and I\u2019ve got Mum going through this. I\u2019ve got Ella, who doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on, but who is asking questions every day.

I\u2019ve got to live with the fact that Annie can\u2019t completely trust me the way I\u2019d like her to, the way I trust her. And I just have to accept that. That\u2019s part of the package.

They want to do something to hold their family member\u2019s perpetrator to account. But it\u2019s very important that the victim or survivor have control over what happens, and if and when they take action or go to police.\u201d</p> <p>There is little research on the impact of sexual assault on secondary victims, the Australian Institute of Family Studies says.</p> <p>\u201cTo the extent that secondary victims are considered in the literature, the focus is usually on the manner in which their response to the victim/survivor\u2019s experiences helps or hinders the primary victim\u2019s recovery,\u201d the institute says.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an important concern. Higher levels of unsupportive behaviour by family members has been found to be more likely for sexual assault victims than for victims of non-sexual assaults.\u201d But few studies had examined the trauma experienced by someone finding out a family member had been sexually abused, the institute says.</p> <p>The royal commission into institutional responses into child sexual abuse acknowledges the lack of research.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have a right to have peace in your life.

What are the impacts of child sexual abuse on the intimate partners and children of child sexual abuse survivors? And what are the support needs of the families of child and adult child sexual abuse survivors?\u201d she says.</p> <p>Annie says there is not enough acknowledgement of the quiet role secondary victims play in trying to be supportive while grappling with their anger and sadness. While telling her family about the extent of her abuse has been difficult, especially while also repeating her story to members of the church, the royal commission and police, Annie says the experience has ultimately proved worthwhile.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a certain kind of freedom that comes with coming forward,\u201d she says. \u201cThe process is flawed, it\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not OK, and survivors and their families deserve better.

The legal issues are not clear cut. Timor and Australia agreed on three treaties from 2002 and 2006 to share resources in adjacent maritime areas and to suspend maritime boundary claims for 50 years. Timor has amassed a $16bn Petroleum Fund as a result.</p> <p>Australia may be right to argue that it is lawful to manage disputes in this way. In practice, however, Timor had little choice but to cut a deal. In 2002, Australia cunningly withdrew its consent to the compulsory settlement of maritime boundary disputes at the international court of justice and under the UN law of the sea convention.</p> <p>This was technically legal. Countries may give or withhold their consent in advance to international adjudication. Timor was thus prevented from suing Australia in an independent court \u2013 even if its substantive legal claims to maritime boundaries were correct.</p> <p>Australia prefers negotiation on boundary disputes to adjudication. Negotiation has some advantages. But it also often benefits a country with more bargaining power, as in the huge imbalance between Australia and Timor. China similarly prefers negotiation over courts in the South China Sea because it has more leverage over its neighbours.</p> <p>When negotiation breaks down, there is then no independent court to apply international law, which provides the underlying rules on where boundaries should be drawn. An obstructive country can simply refuse to reach agreement or to recognise another country\u2019s rights. </p> <p>Timor now argues that the 2006 treaty is invalid because Australia spied on its treaty negotiators, thus gaining an unfair advantage. While spying alone does not invalidate a treaty, fraud can. It is untested whether espionage constitutes fraud.</p> <p>That claim is being tested in another case, a binding arbitration between Australia and Timor \u2013 itself tarnished by Australia\u2019s seizure of documents from Timor\u2019s lawyer in Canberra, Bernard Collaery. In 2014, the international court of justice ordered Australia not to interfere with Timor\u2019s legal communications, since doing so may undermine the equality of parties to a dispute under the United Nations Charter. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/australia-illegally-occupying-maritime-territory-of-timor-leste-protesters-say\">Australia illegally occupying maritime territory of Timor-Leste, protesters say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the treaty is invalid it would reopen the boundary and resource issues.

There are practical concerns too about the economic and environmental feasibility of Timor\u2019s ambitious development plans.</p> <p>Timor\u2019s boundary claims are nonetheless strong. Australia\u2019s last minute, peremptory removal of international judicial oversight in 2002 may well indicate that it privately agrees.</p> <p>Ultimately, what is technically legal may not necessarily be wise, just, or ethical foreign policy. There is an inescapable perception that Australia is denying its tiny, impoverished neighbour its sovereign birthright to determine its boundaries, control its own resources, and shape its own destiny.</p> <p>This dynamic contaminates the wider bilateral relationship.

  "<p>Last week, in the lead up to the new parliament, the treasurer Scott Morrison sought to outline <a href=\"http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/speech/015-2016/\">his economic vision</a>. Unfortunately, rather than provide any clear ideas of where he sees the nation\u2019s economy heading, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/scott-morrison-hits-out-at-taxed-nots-and-warns-of-recession-risk\">the speech</a> was a mishmash of internal inconsistencies, statistical misreadings, and statements which made less sense the more you paid attention to them. </p> <p>The big take away from the speech was Morrison\u2019s desire to ape Joe Hockey\u2019s outlook of the world as being divided into two types. Where Joe Hockey talked of \u201clifters and leaners\u201d Scott Morrison has decided that \u201cthere is a new divide \u2013 the taxed and the taxed nots\u201d.</p> <p>Sigh.</p> <p>I guess then we can also say that there is a new divide in treasurers \u2013 those who simplistically view the world through ill-thought out binary oppositions, and those who don\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/a-piece-of-string-a-banana-and-a-cassowary-walk-into-scott-morrisons-bar\">A piece of string, a banana, and a cassowary walk into Scott Morrison's bar | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morrison\u2019s shtick about net-taxpayers comes from the finding by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (Natsem) that 53% of households in Australia are net taxpayers \u2013 down from 56% in 2005.</p> <p>Now suggesting that this means \u201cmore Australians are ... likely today to be net beneficiaries of the government than contributors\u201d as Morrison did is dopey enough, but the treasurer went further. He argued it meant \u201con current settings, more Australians today are likely to go through their entire lives without ever paying tax than for generations\u201d.</p> <p>The problem is the Natsem modelling is a snapshot. It doesn\u2019t look at people\u2019s paying of tax throughout their lifetime. </p> <p>Morrison\u2019s use of the snapshot to suggest things about people\u2019s lifetimes would be like looking at the current unemployment rate of 5.7% and saying the rate means you have a 5.7% chance of being unemployed at some point in your life. </p> <p>Thus the treasurer arguing that \u201cmore Australians\u201d are \u201cnever paying more tax than they receive in government payments\u201d is a gross exaggeration.</p> <p>Never? Really, treasurer?</p> <p>The Natsem data shows the major reason for the decline in the number of net-taxpayers is the ageing population. While 53% of Australians are net-taxpayers, when you exclude those over 65 the figure rises to 67%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of net taxpayers by household type (2015)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XADuQ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Of course the overall rate of net-taxpayers is falling \u2013 since the start of the century the percentage of the Australian population over 65 has gone from 12.4% to 15%.</p> <p>I look forward to Morrison suggesting we need to do something about those taxed-not pensioners. </p> <p>But no. </p> <p>Morrison didn\u2019t even use his assertions to make a strong case for his changes to the taxation of superannuation \u2013 clearly one area where the \u201ctaxed-not\u201d could be taxed more. </p> <p>All he did was meekly refer to \u201cimproving the flexibility of superannuation\u201d \u2013 a phrase so feeble that the only thing it lacks more than meaning is any conviction by Morrison towards his own policy.</p> <p>Rather his target is \u201creining in the growth in welfare spending\u201d. </p> <p>Let us not forget that the most recent data from the department of social security shows the number of those on welfare has declined over the past 15 years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of the working age population on welfare\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tSg9q/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And the one longitudinal study (that is, looking at how things change over the course of lifetimes) in Australia, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.melbourneinstitute.com/downloads/hilda/Stat_Report/statreport_2016.pdf\">the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) Survey</a> by the Melbourne Institute, also fails to support the treasurer\u2019s line of attack.</p> <p>The latest survey report for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/21/housing-affordability-inequality-and-our-flatlining-household-incomes\">2013-14 financial year</a> found that 32% of individuals aged 18\u201364 were living in a household that received income support at some stage in that year \u2013 well down on the 38% of individuals in 2001.</p> <p>The rest of Morrison\u2019s speech was not much better for logical strength.</p> <p> He spoke of some good sense about the fragilities of the Chinese economy \u2013 though when Morrison says \u201cin China, events may prove far less predictable\u201d one wonders how that stacks up against the prediction he made <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F842ee7d9-89d4-4e4f-bc93-045b018bbeb2%2F0140%22\">in parliament last year</a> of the \u201cprosperity and jobs that [the China-Australia free-trade] agreement will deliver\u201d. </p> <p>But elsewhere he struggled to stay consistent. </p> <p>For example, he argued on the one hand that we must \u201cget debt under control by returning the budget to balance through disciplined expenditure restraint\u201d, but he later noted that \u201cwe have kept expenditure under control\u201d and yet also that \u201cexpenditure as a share of the economy remains stubbornly high\u201d.</p> <p>So we must restrain our spending which is under control and stubbornly high?</p> <p>He also suffered from having foolishly said last year in <a href=\"http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/transcript/001-2015/\">his first press conference</a> that \u201cwe have a spending problem, not a revenue problem\u201d.</p> <p>Now he noted that forecasts for nominal GDP growth in the past two years were reduced from 5.25% to 2.5% due to \u201cthe reduction in the terms of trade, commodity prices, in wages and in profits\u201d.</p> <p>That reduction flows through to lower revenue via company and personal income tax. But Morrison cannot bring himself to admit error; thus he termed this not as a \u201crevenue problem\u201d but an \u201cearnings problem\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit like saying you never called someone short, just that they lacked height. </p> <p>Elsewhere he demonstrated his ability to say things, which, like an M. Night Shyamalan film, collapse the moment you subject them to any thought.</p> <p>He agreed with \u201cthose in the banking sector who have said they believe the key to making this cultural shift is to restore banking as a profession\u201d.</p> <p>So banking is not a profession now, but it once was? When did it stop? And if that means something has gone wrong, why did Morrison also suggest that \u201cwe are in even better shape today when it comes to the resilience of our banking and financial system than we have ever been\u201d?</p> <p>So our bankers are no longer acting like professionals, and yet our banking system is in better shape today than ever before?</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest logical car crash came near the beginning of the speech when, after outlining that Australians are becoming too complacent and have been split into the taxed and not-taxed, he asked:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/scott-morrison-hits-out-at-taxed-nots-and-warns-of-recession-risk\">Scott Morrison hits out at 'taxed-nots' and warns of recession risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cAre we more interested in preserving the benefits of what the past 30 years of economic reform has given us, than relinquishing and reinvesting some of those dividends to create a stronger economy for both our own future and the generations that follow?\u201d</p> <p>Is Morrison actually saying we shouldn\u2019t be interested in preserving the benefits of the past 30 years of \u201creform\u201d? </p> <p>And if he really is saying that we need to give up \u201cthe benefits\u201d of this reform in order to create a stronger economy, that doesn\u2019t say much for the worth of all that reform. So we have had 30 years of reform which delivered benefits that now need to be relinquished so we can have a stronger economy? </p> <p>And what exactly are \u201cthe benefits\u201d? Is Morrison suggesting the benefit of economic reform was welfare and people being taxed-not? If that is the case, then again, doesn\u2019t that suggest the reform was basically a failure, given Morrison views welfare as a negative and decries the numbers of the taxed-not?</p> <p>Or is he just saying we need to give up the benefits of reform in order to have more reform in order to benefit again later on?</p> <p>What a scintillating sales pitch.

  "<p>Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/timber-creek-3m-native-title-payout-paves-way-for-billion-dollar-liability-claims\">federal court decision</a> awarding compensation for the extinguishment of native title in the township of Timber Creek in 1994 by the Northern Territory government is an important milestone in the development of our native title laws. It establishes a judicial precedent and a new paradigm for assessing the monetary value of native title in the Australian legal system.</p> <p>The applicants, the Ngaliwurru and Nungali peoples were opposed by the Northern Territory and the commonwealth.</p> <p>The lead applicant, Alan Griffiths, a man steeped in Aboriginal law, lives with his wife in a small outstation on the far western edge of the Northern Territory. When I visited them last year, I found them living in a bush bough shade, with no power and limited access to water. It was not my idea of an easy life. But they exuded optimism; they were on \u201ccountry\u201d, close to important sites, living off the land and visited regularly by family. Access to country remains as important as ever to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/timber-creek-3m-native-title-payout-paves-way-for-billion-dollar-liability-claims\">Timber Creek $3m native title payout paves way for billion-dollar liability claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Justice John Mansfield\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2016/2016fca0900\">decision</a> in Griffiths v Northern Territory of Australia breaks new ground in a number of areas. It is built on the foundation of the constitutional provision that compulsory acquisition of property by government must be on \u201cjust terms\u201d.</p> <p>The court decision provides not just for financial compensation linked to the freehold value of the land, but importantly also acknowledges that the intangible impacts of dispossession can have seriously adverse impacts on native title holders. Mansfield noted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The evidence was that for the Ngaliwurru-Nungali Peoples, ancestral spirits, the people, the country, and everything that exists on it, are viewed as organic parts of one indissoluble whole and that the evidence of loss was significant and keenly felt \u2026</p> </blockquote> <p>Mansfield\u2019s careful and rigorous reasoning makes clear that every case will be different, and will be shaped by local circumstances. His reasoning led him to award $512,000 for the financial loss of non-exclusive possession over 34 lots in the township, and $1.48m in interest for the delay in payment of over 20 years.</p> <p>In addition, and of most significance for Indigenous interests and policymakers, the court awarded a sum of $1.3m related to the intangible impacts of the dispossession involved in the extinguishment of their native title rights. Academic anthropologists have long recognised that this is a looming policy issue; see for example Diane Smith\u2019s 2001 <a href=\"http://caepr.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/Publications/DP/2001_DP222.pdf\">research paper</a> on \u201cvaluing native title\u201d.</p> <p>Mansfield acknowledges the complexity of the judgment on this issue but demonstrates an impressive grasp of the deep-seated and ongoing nature of the damage done to Indigenous people\u2019s connection to country, to culture, and ultimately to the native title holders\u2019 place in the world as they understand it. In this context, the sum awarded is arguably modest, even paltry.</p> <p>The policy implications of Mansfield\u2019s decision extend way beyond Timber Creek, and beyond the legal system itself.</p> <p>The decision\u2019s implications apply primarily to native title which has been extinguished since 1975 and subsequently validated by the Native Title Act. The extent of the areas affected is as yet unknown, but even comparatively small areas may involve very significant valuations where the extinguished tenure was used for urban development.</p> <p>While the principles established in Griffiths will apply to determined native title, the real impact will be on yet to be claimed and determined native title which has been extinguished since 1975 when the Racial Discrimination Act was enacted. Most claims to date have focused on native title which has not been extinguished. This decision will potentially unleash a further round of claims seeking determinations of native title which has, since 1975, been extinguished.</p> <p>The decision will reinforce and strengthen a trend for state and territory governments to negotiate settlements with native title claimants outside of litigation in order to avoid potential compensation awards.</p> <p>The Griffiths decision has strengthened the leverage of Indigenous interests in those future settlement negotiations. The stakes involved for all parties are now considerably larger, and the policy and political arguments in favour of negotiation over litigation have been strengthened.</p> <p>In addition, federal-state conflict will likely be enlivened over an issue first raised in 1993. The Keating government offered to underwrite 75% of the cost of state and territory compensation costs in an attempt to assuage state concerns over the passage of the commonwealth Native Title Act. In the fevered atmosphere of the times, no state or territory accepted the offer, and 23 years on, it is no longer clear whether the commonwealth is prepared to renew the offer.</p> <p>Western Australia has negotiated at least two significant financial agreements, the Yawuru native title agreement in Broome and the Noongar settlement in the south west which were clearly aimed at pre-empting the potential for the awards of huge compensation payments arising from the validation of extensive residential development (with significant freehold valuations) on the margins of Perth, Broome and potentially elsewhere since 1975. Similarly in Victoria, the state has established a legislative <a href=\"http://www.justice.vic.gov.au/home/your+rights/native+title/traditional+owner+settlement+act\">framework</a>, the Traditional Owner Settlement Act 2010, to encourage regional settlements rather than litigation, and has negotiated one settlement agreement to date.</p> <p>Technically, there has been no determination of compensation under these settlement agreements, and thus the cost of the negotiated settlements does not come within the terms of the Keating government offer. But the link is there, and the issue will inevitably be enlivened as state and territory governments work through the implications of the Griffiths decision.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/indigenous-mps-to-meet-youth-in-push-for-constitutional-recognition\">Indigenous MPs to meet youth in push for constitutional recognition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, looking to the next 25 years, the commonwealth itself needs to examine carefully its approach to regulating native title. Given the dollars at stake in resource negotiations, and now in potential compensation claims, the shallow regulatory oversight over the native title negotiation space, and the very real risk that native title groups will be short-changed by carpetbagger advisers, the potential for a future high court decision establishing a fiduciary duty on the commonwealth in relation to the allocation of compensation funds arising from the extinguishment of native title cannot be dismissed.</p> <p>The native title system administered by the courts is mind-numbingly complex, legalistic, extremely slow and cumbersome, and prone to political hyperbole and grandstanding from all quarters. While states such as WA and Victoria have been strategically proactive, other state and federal governments which followed the Keating government have largely failed to make the leaps of imagination and common sense required to bring ordinary justice to native title holders.</p> <p>The courts, for all their faults, have demonstrated that step by small step, they can span the gap. Mansfield\u2019s decision in Griffiths is a huge leap of judicial imagination and yet another small but valuable step towards justice for Australia\u2019s dispossessed first peoples.</p> <p><em>Michael Dillon is a visiting fellow at the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University.</em></p>"
