Those are important states for Trump, but not sufficient for him to win the presidency if he loses states like Florida or North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump campaign should be concerned,\u201d said Scott Tranter, co-founder of Optimus, a Republican data analytics firm. His firm\u2019s analysis suggests a \u201cstrong final showing for the Clinton campaign\u201d in early voting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91724e6b48fd50b00e50d62c383c3cb298c8139a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91724e6b48fd50b00e50d62c383c3cb298c8139a/0_47_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clinton campaign is looking to build an insurmountable lead in Florida and North Carolina during early voting. If she wins either of those states, she\u2019ll probably be the next president.</p> <p>Using 2012 as a guidepost, she appears to be in a strong position in early voting.</p> <p>While Democrats tend to do better in early voting, Republicans usually post an initial lead with mail-in ballots before Democrats surpass them during in-person early voting in mid to late October.</p> <p>Democrats so far have kept it close with mail-in ballots, giving Clinton a chance to run up the score with in-person early voting. To do that, she\u2019ll need non-whites and young people to turn out near the high levels they did in 2012 for Barack Obama.</p> <p>In North Carolina, Democrats have moved ahead of Republicans in early voting. Republicans had held a modest lead based on mail-in ballots returned, but that was at a much narrower margin than in 2012, when Mitt Romney narrowly won the state. After in-person voting began on Thursday, Democrats overtook Republicans in overall votes cast.</p> <p>In Florida, a record 3.1 million people have requested ballots, more than one-third of the total voters in 2012. Democrats have requested almost as many ballots as Republicans: 39 percent vs. 40 percent.</p> <p>By comparison, in 2008, Republicans held a lead of 49 percent to 32 percent in requests, according to an analysis for AP by Catalist, a Democratic analytical firm. Obama won in Florida in 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>Democrats are also showing momentum in the 2nd congressional district of both Maine and Nebraska. The two states allocate electoral votes by congressional district.</p> <p>There\u2019s more where that came from. <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/8aeeaf8ed917469da03b1381cbe13d47/Early-voting:-Democrats-show-strength-in-key-battlegrounds\">Read further here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580a3eb8e4b055209adaff6f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T17:14:13.232Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clinton to meet with Black Lives Matter activists</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In advance of her rally in Cleveland, Ohio, this afternoon, Hillary Clinton will meet with Movement for Black Lives activists Brittany Packnett and DeRay Mckesson, her campaign reports.

I mean, when Michelle, you know, she had her own sort of professional life, and she was very committed, as she is now, to the kids. And so there was this understanding between them before he ran for president that you know, that was his career. She would be as supportive as she could, but she wasn\u2019t really involved. You know, she wasn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t campaign terribly much for him in 2004 when he ran for the Senate, for example, a campaign that I was involved in.

It has a handful of allies in the House and states.</p> <p>From the Panama Canal to the Tea Party, from Phyllis Schlafly to Sarah Palin, the conservative intellectual has viewed the New Right as a sometimes annoying but ultimately worthy friend. New Right activists supplied the institutions, dollars and votes that helped the conservative intellectual reform tax, crime, welfare, and legal policy. But that is no longer the case. Donald Trump was the vehicle by which the New Right went from one part of the conservative coalition to the dominant ideological tendency of the Grand Old Party.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T14:41:29.535Z\">at 3.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5809f6f0e4b005f21833bc73\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T12:51:26.058Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. </p> <p>Can we say we\u2019re in the home stretch?

Media reports focused on the tools the company introduced to allow users to view and manage ad tracking rather than the new powers Google gained.</p> <p>DoubleClick is an advertising serving and tracking company that Google bought in 2007.

It also means that the DoubleClick ads that follow people on the web could be personalized based on the keywords that individuals use in Gmail.</p> <p>Google isn\u2019t the first company to track individuals in this way. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/31/facebook-tracks-all-visitors-breaching-eu-law-report\">Facebook has been tracking logged-in users</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/10/facebook-admits-it-tracks-non-users-but-denies-claims-it-breaches-eu-privacy-law\">and even non-users</a>) by name across the internet whenever they visit websites with Facebook \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d buttons.</p> <p>Google says that the change is optional and is aimed at giving people better control over their data. </p> <p>\u201cGoogle is actually quite late to this game. By now, most of the websites you visit are already sharing your activity with a wide network of third parties who share, collaborate, link and de-link personal information in order to target ads,\u201d said Jules Polonetsky from Future of Privacy Forum.</p> <p>\u201cSome users may appreciate relevant advertising, many others may not. What\u2019s critical is that there are easy ways for those who want to avoid the more robust types of data targeting to be able to take easy steps to do so.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/10/facebook-admits-it-tracks-non-users-but-denies-claims-it-breaches-eu-privacy-law\">Facebook admits it tracks non-users, but denies claims it breaches EU privacy law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Technology companies argue that such tracking allows them to deliver much more targeted, relevant advertising across the internet.

That wall has just fallen.\u201d</p> <p>A Google spokeswoman said that its advertising system had been designed before the smartphone revolution, and that the update in June made it easier for users to control their ad preferences across multiple devices.</p> <p>The company says that more than one billion Google users have accessed the \u2018My Account\u2019 settings that let them control how their data is used.</p> <p>\u201cBefore we launched this update, we tested it around the world with the goal of understanding how to provide users with clear choice and transparency,\u201d Google said. \u201cAs a result, it is 100% optional - if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged. Equally important: we provided prominent user notifications about this change in easy-to-understand language as well as simple tools that let users control or delete their data.\u201d</p> <p>Users that don\u2019t want to be tracked in this way can visit the <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols/search?utm_source=HelpCenter&amp;utm_medium=websearch&amp;utm_campaign=\">activity controls</a> section of their account page on Google, unticking the box marked \u201cInclude Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services\u201d.</p>",

The England international started the goalless draw on Monday when Philippe Coutinho dropped into central midfield in the absence of Adam Lallana and Georginio Wijnaldum. But with the midfielders in contention for the visit of Tony Pulis\u2019s team, and Liverpool\u2019s strongest spell against United arriving when Roberto Firmino replaced Sturridge as the central striker, the 27-year-old faces fierce competition for a starting role.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/21/jose-mourinho-roman-abramovich-chelsea-friends\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho on Roman Abramovich: \u2018We were never friends\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Klopp accepts this is a testing period for a forward whose only goals at club level this season came at Burton Albion in the EFL Cup. But, drawing comparisons with players such as Robert Lewandowski and Gerd M\u00fcller, he believes it can prove beneficial to Sturridge in the long term.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager, who insists the United performance will not influence his selection against West Brom, said: \u201cI think this is a good moment for Dan. It is not easy for him. Most of his time in his life football has been so easy because he is so skilled. The right moment, easy goal, simple goal. The job to do for him, for all of us, before he ends his career is not to think about when he had a moment like this.\u201d</p> <p>Klopp added: \u201cDaniel is hard-working, he is fit, he is doing what all players have to do in the moments like this when it doesn\u2019t quite go for you: keep working. You can\u2019t do a bicycle kick or what Jamie Vardy did last year. His shot when we thought he had to run another 20 yards and then boop! Goal! Sometimes it works. We have to work on this together. He didn\u2019t score, that is the truth, but he had some really good games for us. That is also the truth. For me the [Sadio Man\u00e9] goal against Leicester was the goal of the season so far. It was the kind of movement that we have been working so hard on, then you see it come off. He [Sturridge] makes this way, out of the box, to take two defenders with him and then it opens everything. It is a sign of development. So I\u2019m fine with it.\u201d</p> <p>The Liverpool manager admitted he remained in awe of Sturridge\u2019s finishing in training but, while that has yet to transfer into Premier League matches this season, he has no plans to speak to the striker over his current frustrations. \u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you have a problem, you don\u2019t want someone coming up to you all the time, tapping your shoulder and saying: \u2018Hey, it\u2019s all right! You can do it!\u2019 I respect these guys. I know they know. So let\u2019s go through it.</p> <p>\u201cIf we had a shooting exercise now, there would be tears in your eyes when you see him. You are like: \u2018That is unbelievable!\u2019 But then you see the games. There are moments when you think he should score and he doesn\u2019t but you have to carry on. It is a very useful moment in his career. A big name \u2026 Lewandowski. There were times when he didn\u2019t score. Gerd M\u00fcller. There were games he didn\u2019t score. I still can\u2019t believe that. You look back on his career and he scored 600 times but there were moments when he didn\u2019t score. It is only about handling situations like this. It is not to make a big thing about it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The suggestion that the previous government failed to address questions surrounding air quality (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/19/cameron-aide-said-government-was-exposed-on-heathrow-over-air-quality\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 20 October) does not reflect the progress that has been made on the issue since December 2015. Since then, the government\u2019s air quality plan, updated modelling undertaken by Heathrow and an independent study by Cambridge University have all shown that baseline air-quality levels around the airport will have significantly improved by the time a new runway is built, as the nation\u2019s vehicle fleet gradually becomes cleaner.</p> <p>The Airports Commission\u2019s analysis concluded that a third runway at Heathrow can be delivered in accordance with EU air-quality limit law, and would have less impact on health receptors (where people live and work) than a runway at Gatwick would have on the community in that area. A new runway at the UK\u2019s hub airport represents an opportunity to deliver significant improvements to air quality around Heathrow: the redesign of local roads, support for sustainable transport and the opportunity to introduce an airport emissions charge all have the potential to bring improvements in air quality.</p> <p>Since the Airports Commission\u2019s unanimous recommendation to the prime minister that Heathrow should expand, we have put in place a triple-lock guarantee on air quality. This includes a commitment to meeting our existing targets to improve air quality, ensuring that action can be taken if required to reduce road traffic and a commitment that extra capacity at an expanded Heathrow will only be released when it is clear that the airport\u2019s contribution will not delay compliance with EU air quality limits.</p> <p>Expanding Heathrow will deliver up to \u00a3211bn in economic benefits for the whole of the UK, creating up to 180,000 new jobs and 10,000 apprenticeships. It has the support of unions, business, local residents and politicians, with 71% of Conservative MPs and 73% of Labour MPs backing a third runway in a recent poll of parliamentarians.</p> <p>The government\u2019s decision on airport capacity follows a rigorous, independent, \u00a320m, two-and-a-half-year deep-dive into the issue, including a public consultation. It confirmed that Heathrow would not delay compliance with EU air quality limits, would see fewer people affected by noise and is the best choice for expansion.

Both of my books get deeply unfunny on that topic, because when you\u2019re writing about how your government sanctions child abuse and sexual assaults, withholds medical and psychological treatment for detainees and fails to prevent torture, even murder, on their watch while insisting that they\u2019re worried about \u201csaving lives at sea\u201d, it\u2019s impossible not to wonder what the actual hell is happening to us.</p> <p>But most importantly, there\u2019s the fact that the last few years have seen the government achieve \u2026 what, exactly? Abbott\u2019s triumphs, such as they were, were all in cancelling programs and projects of the Gillard and Rudd governments, without actually creating anything of his own. Turnbull\u2019s first year-and-a-bit hasn\u2019t even reached that low bar: 100-plus days since the election, and the closest we\u2019ve come to progress is the dead-in-the-water plebiscite.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/20/halal-products-funding-islamic-extremism-claims-nationals-mp\">Halal products may be funding Islamist extremism, claims Nationals MP</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Government is a powerful force for good, when it\u2019s given a chance to do what it\u2019s designed to do.

  "<p>Lewis Hamilton, even at his most graciously well behaved, has been outmanoeuvred by his rival Nico Rosberg in the buildup to Sunday\u2019s United States Grand Prix.</p> <p>Hamilton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/20/lewis-hamilton-f1-title-nico-rosberg\" title=\"\">when asked how he would feel if he lost his world title</a>, said he would take it like a man. But when his Mercedes team-mate was asked how he would react if he lost, he replied: \u201cI have not thought of that.</p> <p>Such negative thoughts I will fully avoid. It won\u2019t make me any faster this weekend if I think how I might feel if I lose. That doesn\u2019t work. I am just planning to go for more race wins at the moment and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton loves this circuit, its swoops and climbs, its fast curves and overtaking possibilities, and he was quickest in Friday morning\u2019s practice, beating Rosberg by 0.315 seconds, though he was slower in the afternoon. He may well win here on Sunday \u2013 he usually does, having been victorious in three of the four races staged at the Circuit of the Americas. It\u2019s easy to see him cavorting again under his black Stetson and in a haze of sprayed champagne at the top of the podium. But even that, and three other wins in the remaining races, might not be enough to bring down the remorselessly consistent Rosberg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/20/lewis-hamilton-f1-title-nico-rosberg\">Lewis Hamilton ready to move on and come back stronger if he loses F1 title</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In downtown Austin the other evening Mercedes invited F1 correspondents into their virtual garage. We wore noise-cancelling headphones and were asked to take part in a listening experience, taking in the sonically rich environment of Hamilton\u2019s and Rosberg\u2019s garages, using recordings made at Silverstone in the summer. It was difficult not to feel that Rosberg is virtually champion, a dogged compiler of points amid Hamilton\u2019s self-inflicted or unlucky mishaps.</p> <p>As Hamilton will ruefully attest, it is very difficult to wrong-foot the German. Would he, someone asked, just drive for second places, with a lead of 33 points? \u201cI am aware of that but I will definitely not be putting any thought into that,\u201d said Rosberg. \u201cI am definitely going for the win rather than trying to bring home any second places. If I am in second place, behind Lewis, I will still be pushing for the win.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much pressure Lewis is putting on himself. I am just trying to win this race, as I have done for the past three years. I am just trying to focus on this race.\u201d</p> <p>Rosberg insists he is taking things race by race, which may not be the stuff of tabloid headlines but seems to be working for him. \u201cIt is just something that has come about and I am sticking to it because it is working well,\u201d the 31-year-old said. \u201cWhy waste energy thinking about other things? It is better to stay in the zone and focus.\u201d Thank goodness the more emotional Hamilton is a little less predictable.</p>",
  "<p>Higher borrowing costs and lower tax receipts could deprive Philip Hammond of up to \u00a314bn when he presents his autumn statement next month, denying him vital funds to boost the economy after the Brexit vote, a leading tax and spending thinktank has warned.<br></p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that an unexpected downturn in the public finances in September was likely to be repeated in the next few months and bust the government\u2019s annual borrowing limits set earlier this year.</p> <p>Thomas Pope, an economist at the IFS, said the Treasury\u2019s room for manoeuvre would be tight after figures for the first six months of the financial year showed tax receipts had failed to match projections by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).</p> <p>He said: \u201cBorrowing looks set to be higher than the OBR forecast in March, possibly by a reasonable margin. The trend so far suggests that over the year as a whole receipts could undershoot by \u00a314bn.\u201d</p> <p>Pope said income from other sources could limit the hole in the Treasury\u2019s budget to \u00a38bn, but it could nevertheless act as a brake on plans to support a wide range of infrastructure projects and provide incentives for businesses to invest.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/public-deficit-10-bn-corporation-tax-receipts-philip-hammond-shock-into-slugs\">The IFS report followed a collapse in corporation tax receipts to the lowest level since 2009 that helped widen the budget deficit in September to \u00a310.6bn. </a></p> <p>A slowdown in the growth of VAT receipts was also blamed for pushing the deficit \u00a31.3bn higher, or 14.5%, than the same month last year and above the \u00a310.5bn recorded in August.</p> <p>City analysts, who had expected an \u00a38.5bn shortfall, said the OBR would need to rip up its pre-Brexit vote forecasts after a run of projections from all the major economic institutions showing GDP growth and tax receipts slowing next year.</p> <p>In recent months Hammond has sent conflicting signals about the likely size and scope of extra spending to compensate for the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations and forecasts of growth for next year that have halved from around 2.2% to nearer 1%.</p> <p>Immediately after the vote he ripped up George Osborne\u2019s fiscal rule of achieving a budget surplus by the end of the parliament, and talked about the need for extra spending to create jobs and improve the country\u2019s infrastructure. </p> <p>But he has sought to dampen expectations by emphasising that he is constrained by volatile international money markets, which could drive up the government\u2019s borrowing costs if he is seen to be reckless.</p> <p>Hammond said on Friday: \u201cWe have already made significant progress in bringing the public finances under control, reducing the deficit by almost two-thirds since 2010, but our debt and deficit remain too high. We remain committed to fiscal discipline and will return the budget to balance over a sensible period of time, in a way that allows us the space to support the economy as needed.\u201d</p> <p>The weak September figures took the budget deficit to \u00a345bn for the first six months of the year, down nearly 5% from the same period in 2015. The Office for National Statistics could not offer a reason for the dive in corporation tax receipts.</p> <p>Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said if the public finances continued on the current trend, borrowing would overshoot the OBR\u2019s forecast of \u00a355.5bn for the financial year by about \u00a317bn.</p> <p>He said: \u201cEven before the vote to leave the EU, the OBR\u2019s fiscal forecasts were looking optimistic. But the weaker economic prospects over the next few years as a result means that these forecasts are likely to be revised substantially in the autumn statement next month.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/britishamericantobacco\">British American Tobacco</a> has offered to pay $47bn (\u00a338bn) for full control of Reynolds American in a takeover that would create the world\u2019s biggest tobacco company.</p> <p>The cash-plus-shares deal would plunge BAT back into the US market after a 12-year absence and is also expected to speed the development of e-cigarettes and vapes.</p> <p>BAT, whose brands include Lucky Strike and Benson &amp; Hedges, already owns 42.2% of Reynolds and is offering to buy the remainder of the firm, which traces its roots back to before the American war of independence.</p> <p>The British firm has owned a stake in Reynolds since 2004, when it merged its US subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson with RJ Reynolds Tobacco to create Reynolds American.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the moment Reynolds American was born, this was always the most likely outcome,\u201d said Cenkos Securities analyst Rae Maile. \u201cThe US marketplace is fundamentally very attractive and offers a source of sustainable profit growth.\u201d</p> <p>BAT said it was prepared to pay $56.50 a share, comprising $24.13 in cash and $32.37 in shares. The offer, structured as a merger, is worth 20% more than Reynolds\u2019 closing price on Thursday and values the US company at \u00a366bn. The combined firm would be valued at about \u00a3157bn.</p> <p>BAT\u2019s shares, the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 index this year, initially rose before closing down nearly 3% at \u00a346.66, despite a strong trading update for the first nine months.<br></p> <p>Revenues were up 8.1% stripping out exchange-rate movements, while it sold 497bn cigarettes, 2.2% more than last year.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/mar/07/bat-bucks-market-fall-amid-talk-of-interest-in-reynolds-america\">Speculation has been rife for months that BAT might decide to buy out Reynolds</a> as tobacco companies jockey for position.</p> <p>BAT said that buying the number two US tobacco company, after Philip Morris, would give it a leading position in the American market, the world\u2019s second biggest after China. </p> <p>Reynolds has a 35% market share in the US, where it owns the low-cost market leader Pall Mall, Newport, the top-selling menthol cigarette, and Camel, a mid-market brand popular with younger Americans.</p> <p>BAT could produce its own brands in the US via Reynolds\u2019 factory in Tobaccoville, North Carolina.<br></p> <p>While smoking rates in the US are declining, analysts said it remains a market with huge growth potential. Population growth means that while smoking rates are falling, the number of smokers has remained relatively constant at about 45 million people for several decades.</p> <p>US cigarettes are also relatively cheap compared with prices in the UK, leaving scope for the company to boost profits by raising prices.</p> <p>A tie-up would also allow BAT and Reynolds to build on their existing technology-sharing partnership in e-cigarettes and vapes.<br></p> <p>The nascent market for what Reynolds calls \u201ccigalike products\u201d has no dominant player, but BAT would be able to combine its Vype brand with the US firm\u2019s Vuse products.</p> <p>BAT said it expected cost savings of $400m, a relatively low figure for such a large merger because its lack of presence in the US means there is limited overlap in their businesses.<br></p> <p>Nicandro Durante, BAT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe proposed merger of our two great companies is the logical progression in our relationship and offers all shareholders a stake in a stronger, truly global tobacco and next-generation products company.\u201d<br></p> <p>BAT said Reynolds shareholders would gain from the deal by holding shares in a bigger company with the clout to sell Reynolds\u2019 brands round the world.<br></p> <p>Guy Ellison, the head of UK equities at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, said that while the timing of the move was a surprise, the strategic rationale made \u201cperfect sense, pivoting BAT further towards the high-value US market, consolidating some strong brands and Reynolds\u2019 position in next-generation tobacco\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>The Guardian was the family paper because my mother decided that when she went to university she should read a quality daily: she chose the Manchester Guardian, so I was brought up on James Cameron and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nancybankssmith\" title=\"\">Nancy Banks-Smith</a>. I\u2019m 50 now, so I\u2019ve been reading it for some 35 years. When&#xa0;it did its big design change in the mid-80s, I was working on a student magazine and we all earnestly and a bit arrogantly picked apart the new look.</p> <p>I\u2019m a solicitor in a large international commercial law firm. It\u2019s fair to say I don\u2019t come across many other Guardian readers in my line of work. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joris-luyendijk\" title=\"\">Joris Luyendijk</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/voices-of-finance\" title=\"\">Voices of Finance</a> series was&#xa0;very perceptive: it made me realise that the City, in which I work, must seem like a rather exotic zoo. I like the way the Guardian is constantly taking its readers into bits of the world they\u2019d probably rather not go.</p> <p>The paper has always mattered to me somehow. I was stupidly proud when I fed a story to the diary in the early 90s and saw it in print. When, a few years later, the business section covered a case I was involved in, I was furious at how wrong they got it and how they seemed to have been taken in by a not very pleasant character. I was disappointed, as a headmaster might be of a lively but troublesome pupil.</p> <p>I live in Warwickshire. We moved out of London some 20 years ago. We still regret leaving its life and opportunities and so many of our friends, but the peace and the beauty of ever-changing light on the country fields as we walk our dog make up for a lot, as do the local schools and house prices. More importantly, friendship and support come easily in our little town. And we can be in the stalls at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 25 minutes. We\u2019d have to live in Shaftesbury Avenue to see theatre that good that quickly in London. We&#xa0;see a lot of plays.</p> <p>I love the fashion and the sports pages: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jesscartnermorley\" title=\"\">Jess Cartner-Morley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hadleyfreeman\" title=\"\">Hadley Freeman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barneyronay\" title=\"\">Barney Ronay</a>.

But Epstein says: \u201cIf we have more races here we will be competing for a limited base of fans, and we could be weaker for a number of years. Five or 10 years down the road we would build a bigger audience overall. But there could be some pain first.\u201d</p> <p>Epstein, who is impressed by the way Melbourne and Montreal promote their race weekends, added: \u201cWe are competing for the entertainment dollar. Promoters have to become more creative. I would like to see more money spent on promoting the sport. I think fees should be lower so we can lower the ticket prices.\u201d</p> <p>He would also like to see more cars on the grid and, most of all, an American driver. \u201cHaving an American driver would be huge. We can always be welcoming but there\u2019s no substitute for the home town hero. People connect with personalities.\u201d</p> <p>At least the Americans have their own team this year. Gene Haas, who made his millions in machine tools, is the founder of the Haas team which has made an impressive debut this year. \u201cFrom the standpoint of Formula One, being a global product, it\u2019s important to be in the United States.

Carney cut his teeth as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, where the credo tends to be kill or be killed rather than turn the other cheek. Publicly, he will shrug the attacks off. Those who know him say that in private he would not have been so relaxed. \u201cHe will have have been furious, absolutely livid,\u201d said one. </p> <p>Carney could get his own back. He was lured to Britain by Osborne to take charge at Threadneedle Street in 2013 on an \u00a3800,000-a-year salary. The then-chancellor wanted the Canadian to serve for eight years but Carney said he would only stay for five. The implication was that he had political ambitions back in Canada and did not want to tie himself down in the UK for too long.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau\u2019s</a> election victory means there is not likely to be a vacancy as prime minister at any time soon. Other options have also been closed off. Carney might be considered a good bet to run the International Monetary Fund, but Christine Lagarde has just been given a second five-year term.</p> <p>As a result, the attractions of staying on at the Bank for eight years have increased over time. Having been committed to leaving in 2018, Carney has been keeping his options open and has said he will make a final decision by the end of the year.</p> <p>But is Carney ready to walk? If the governor thought that he had lost the confidence of the prime minister and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the answer would be yes. As it is, a charm offensive is being mounted to persuade him to stay.<br></p> <p>The Treasury says there is no \u201cGet Carney\u201d campaign being mounted in Whitehall. On the contrary, Hammond went out of his way in New York earlier this month to say he wanted the governor to stay on until 2021. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>For her part, May took immediate steps to smooth things over with the Bank as soon as it became clear that her comments were being interpreted as an attack on the governor. Downing Street called Threadneedle Street on the morning after the speech to say sorry. The Bank accepted the apology and says it was a cock-up rather than a conspiracy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/criticising-mark-carney-tory-hobby-bank-england-governor\">How criticising Mark Carney became the new Tory sport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The backdrop to the debate about the governor\u2019s future is the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Sterling has fallen sharply on the foreign exchanges, the economy is slowing and the Treasury is planning to announce higher borrowing in the autumn statement next month. Former members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee say this is not a good time to be questioning Threadneedle Street\u2019s independence or to be pushing the governor towards the exit.</p> <p>Former monetary policy committee member Kate Barker said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Carney should go. To remove him in a way that looks political would be really, really unhelpful.\u201d</p> <p>Another former MPC member, Andrew Sentance, thinks there is an argument for changing the Bank\u2019s inflation target in order to make life easier for savers and pensioners, but added: \u201cThe government has got so much on its plate with Brexit that it does not want to go and pick a fight with the Bank of England.\u201d</p> <p>Those who know the governor say the decision is finely poised but won\u2019t be affected by what is written about him. Instead, it will depend on whether he sees being in charge at the Bank until 2021 as a challenge that will burnish his reputation or a poisoned chalice from which he doesn\u2019t need to drink.</p>",

Things will move when owners are ready for them to move but that doesn\u2019t mean that progress isn\u2019t being made.\u201d</p> <p>Waller, who joined the NFL in 2007 after spending 17 years working for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/diageo\">Diageo</a> and its predecessor companies, said the organisation had been \u201cmethodical\u201d in its expansion into the UK. Its plans were heavily backed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/02/george-osborne-nfl-american-football-team-london\">George Osborne, the former chancellor, who publicly courted the NFL and talked up the prospects of a permanent team in London.</a></p> <p>The NFL agreed a deal to play at Twickenham, the home of English rugby, as a stepping stone to expanding further in the UK and potentially establishing a permanent London-based franchise. Other scheduled events at Wembley mean it could not expand the number of matches played there. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/tottenham-could-one-day-hosy-a-nfl-franchise-says-chairman-daneil-levy\">The organisation has also struck a deal to play at least two matches a year for a decade at Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s new stadium from 2018</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to work our way through, in a disciplined way, the issues of putting a team here so you can look everybody in the eye and show them you have done the due diligence,\u201d Waller said. \u201cTo me, the big issue for us putting a team here is that team has to be competitive.\u201d</p> <p>Waller said that the NFL\u2019s progress in the UK was ahead of their expectations and that the NFL highlight shows on the BBC are \u201cbringing in literally the youngest demographic of any show on the BBC\u201d.</p> <p>The NFL will also play a game in Mexico this year and is looking to expand in Canada, Germany and China. However, Waller insisted that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU would not change the NFL\u2019s strategy and could actually help the sport.</p> <p>\u201cNo, we have to manage that,\u201d Waller said when asked whether Brexit changed anything. \u201cOne of things you learn in an international business is that you can\u2019t control any of the environments that you operate in so you have to be agile and adept at managing changing circumstances. I don\u2019t think anybody yet knows what the implications of Brexit will be and they will be different to what we currently anticipate them to be I am sure. But I am pretty sure we will find a way like everyone else to not only manage around it but make the most of it</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/01/london-jacksonville-jaguars-argentina-pumas-marquee-sports\">London proves lush habitat for Jaguars and Pumas hunting cash</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cObviously in the short term you have currency fluctuations and those are both positive and negative for us. The currency takes the revenues down, but the expenses go down as well. I think the biggest impact will be what the implications are for free movement of labour and moving backwards and forwards across borders.\u201d</p> <p>The NFL is expected to generate record revenues of more than $13bn (\u00a310.7bn) this year \u2013 a mixture of TV income, sponsorship deals, ticket sales and merchandise \u2013 up 50% on 2010, well ahead of the \u00a33.3bn recorded by the Premier League\u2019s 20 clubs, which includes ticket sales.</p> <p>The NFL has a significantly different business model to the Premier League. While English football clubs are effectively free to spend as they wish, the NFL has a salary cap, a draft system that means the worst team in the league gets the first pick of the best college graduates, and shares the money generated from television, ticket and merchandise sales between all the teams. The NFL is effectively a socialist system in the biggest free market economy in the world.</p> <p>\u201cI think the beauty of our model is that its socially equitable and economically allows all teams to be more or less equal,\u201d Waller said. \u201cThat is the heart of what being a fan is about \u2013 the belief that any team can win on any day. I think our league has structured itself and our ownership has consciously taken decisions to keep the competitive and economic equity and keep balance. That I think is a huge strength but there is a lot of work that is required to keep that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When most shows change their theme song it\u2019s a cosmetic difference, just a little something to freshen the old girl up. When Crazy Ex-Girlfriend changes the song it\u2019s a whole new mission statement. Rachel Bloom\u2019s hilarious relationship show (with musical numbers!) may be a little bit more focused for its second outing and that makes this often overlooked gem twice as good. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/21/crazy-ex-girlfriend-rachel-bloom-im-not-saying-love-is-bull-but\">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend's Rachel Bloom: 'I'm not saying love is bull, but\u2026'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzY3EaJTuJk\">original theme song</a> recapped the logline for the program each week, telling the audience that Rebecca Bunch (Bloom) was working hard at a New York job but it made her blue. After a chance encounter on the street with her middle school ex Josh Chan (Vincent Rodriguez III), she decides to quit her career at a white-shoe law firm and move to West Covina, California, a dumpy suburb that just happens to be Josh\u2019s hometown. She repeatedly tells everyone \u2013 including her new bestie and co-worker Paula (Donna Lynne Champlin), her low-energy neighbor Heather (Vella Lovell) and Josh\u2019s best friend Greg (Santino Fontana) \u2013 that she didn\u2019t move there for Josh, it\u2019s just a coincidence. However, we all know that she\u2019s kind of crazy. </p> <p>The new theme song tries to mitigate Rebecca\u2019s insanity. \u201cI\u2019m just a girl in love,\u201d Rebecca sings in an Andrews Sisters style. \u201cI can\u2019t be held accountable for my actions.\u201d It\u2019s not Rebecca that\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s love that is making her crazy. The chorus echoes her sentiment. \u201cThey say loves makes you crazy,\u201d they sing. \u201cWhen you\u2019re calling her crazy, you\u2019re calling her in love.\u201d</p> <p>After the first season finale, when Rebecca and Josh finally have sex and she confesses that she moved to West Covina to be with him, their relationship entered an entirely new phase, one that is just as difficult to navigate as the high-level stalking of season one. What it says in the song is true. So much time is spent on the courtship and trying to figure out how to get someone close enough that love can blossom, but what are any of us supposed to do once we get it. Rebecca and Josh certainly don\u2019t know. It\u2019s doubly hard for them watching their romantic ideals get crushed. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrgVFtawutg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VrgVFtawutg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Since Josh\u2019s ex kicked him out when he dumped her, he\u2019s crashing at Rebecca\u2019s, but he\u2019s sleeping on the couch and refusing to admit they sleep together. Rebecca is trying to make him comfortable, but they\u2019re both struggling with intimacy. Josh has sex with her every night \u2013 Paula says he\u2019s \u201cF-sploiting\u201d her for sex \u2013 but he refuses to let her in emotionally. Rebecca finds herself no closer to her ideal of romantic love even though she\u2019s landed him, which was supposed to be the hard part. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The first several episodes of this season are about the characters dealing with getting what they wanted all along. Rebecca conquered Josh, but didn\u2019t expect their union to be so complicated. The first musical number in the premiere is called Love Kernels, and Rebecca sings about how she takes every compliment, nice gesture and kind word from Josh and binges on them in her memory when she\u2019s insecure about the trajectory of their partnership. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Rebecca isn\u2019t the only one struggling. Paula got Rebecca and Josh together and it fixed her marriage and got her a new friend. So why does she still feel like her life is lacking meaning? Greg wanted his life to have a wake-up call, so he decided to join AA and get sober (with all the casual drinking that happens on TV, it was hard to realize he was a drunk until it was pointed out). But now that he\u2019s getting his act together, dealing with his emotions rather than drinking them away is a lot trickier than he expected. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/17/best-fall-tv-2016-rocky-horror\">The week's best TV: Rocky Horror, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Black Mirror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This all makes the show sound like a dreary treatise on romance. While it is (a treatise on romance, that is, certainly not dreary) what makes it one of the best shows on television is that it is so much more. There are still the campy if emotional music numbers (early highlights include a Snow White-esque number for Paula and Greg, singing an Irish folk song about what would happen when he got drunk) and more than enough comedy to cover over those deep feelings that are bubbling right below the surface. <br></p> <p>Still it\u2019s Rebecca\u2019s craziness that keeps this train chugging along. As the comparison of the theme songs suggest, this new season is a contrast between the anxiety of acquiring love and the anxiety of holding on to it, but they\u2019re all symptoms of the broken way that we all think about relationships. Even as they progress, Rebecca is finding out that the song stays the same. <br></p>",

Constitutionally, it can demand a Belgian veto, and a Belgian veto can scupper the whole deal.<br></p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the Walloons\u2019 problem with the deal? </strong>They think it favours big corporations over small businesses, that their agriculture will be undermined by cheap Canadian imports, and that Ceta will erode environmental standards and weaken labour laws.</p> <p><strong>I seem to have heard these arguments before. </strong>Indeed. It is the clash of free trade versus protectionism now being played out in the UK and all over Europe. If Ceta falls, there\u2019s not much hope for the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between Europe and the US, and very little prospect of the post-Brexit UK getting the sort of free trade deal it wants with the EU.</p> <p><strong>How come the Walloons have all this power?</strong> It reflects the hopelessly fragmented nature of Belgian political life. The system is based on a series of checks and balances between French-speaking Wallonia and Dutch-speaking Flanders. It makes the country more or less ungovernable \u2013 literally so after the 2010 election,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Belgian_government_formation#Speculation_on_the_possible_partition_of_Belgium\"> when it had no elected government for 589 days</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why doesn\u2019t Belgium just split?</strong> The idea has been floated. Some Walloons favour joining France, while others prefer Germany.</p> <p><strong>Not to be confused with:</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedonia#Duck_Soup\">Freedonia</a>.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cAbout time someone stood up against the dehumanising forces of global neoliberalism.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cWhat a bunch of Walloonies.\u201d</p>",

Taylor, 46, did not respond to several emails and calls seeking comment.</p> <p>At the other end of the corporate scale, Anthony Scaramucci of New York is the co-founder and co-owner of SkyBridge Capital, a $12bn hedge fund, which is not a small business.<br></p> <p>Another Trump adviser, Joe Salvucci of Pennsylvania, owns and is chairman of Peak Technical Staffing, a large employment agency that brings in annual revenues of about $60m by supplying companies with contract staff. Salvucci, 60, said he bought the business from his father about 30 years ago.<br></p> <p>Salvucci and his company have been accused of failing to act on allegations of sexual assault and harassment made by female staff, and even of retaliating against those who made them. He denies this.<br></p> <p>In 2013, 27-year-old manager Allison Trathen alleged that her boss in an Illinois branch of Peak Technical subjected her to a campaign of harassment that culminated in him following her into an elevator and assaulting her by rubbing his genitals against her backside while grunting.<br></p> <p>Trathen alleged in a federal lawsuit that she emailed Salvucci, the Trump adviser, three times anonymously to say that she was being sexually harassed by her boss, eventually identifying him by name. \u201cI just want my supervisor to stop with the inappropriate texts/emails and to stop trying to touch me inappropriately,\u201d she wrote. She said no investigation was opened.<br></p> <p>When she was assaulted by Williams a second time, she said, she took a leave of absence, and Williams was allowed to resign. But even after that, she alleged, one of Salvucci\u2019s senior executives insisted to her that the activity had been a \u201ctwo-way street\u201d and tried to have her sign a document saying she would comply with company policy on harassment.<br></p> <p>In court filings, Peak Technical denied Trathen\u2019s allegations that she had alerted Salvucci, the chief executive who is now a Trump adviser, about her claims of sexual harassment. But the company eventually settled her lawsuit, for an undisclosed amount.<br></p> <p>In 2007, office administrator Mary McLaughlin alleged that she was terminated from her job after telling bosses in a Michigan office that she was sexually harassed by a co-worker. The alleged harasser was also terminated from his job.<br></p> <p>Peak Technical then advised another company where McLaughlin had applied for a job not to hire her, saying she was \u201csomewhat unstable and defensive\u201d, according to a $300,000 lawsuit McLaughlin brought against the company.<br></p> <p>Denying that McLaughlin\u2019s termination was related to the harassment allegations, Peak Technical said in a court filing that it was due to \u201cperformance deficiencies\u201d. After McLaughlin named Salvucci\u2019s sister as a witness she planned to call at trial, the case went to mediation. McLaughlin\u2019s attorney said it was \u201cresolved under a confidentiality agreement\u201d.<br></p> <p>In 1992, Rebecca Magnuson, a 27-year-old Peak Technical employee in Virginia, alleged that she was constantly sexually harassed by the manager of a Volkswagen dealership to which she was assigned. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/donald-trump-net-worth-forbes-400\">Donald Trump's net worth is down $800m, according to Forbes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The manager repeatedly made lewd comments about Magnuson\u2019s body, she claimed, and asked her three times to leave work with him and check into a hotel, telling her \u201che could make or break her career\u201d.

  "<p>Early afternoon at Crystal Palace\u2019s Beckenham headquarters and, as first-team players drift off contemplating their pre-match homework, Alan Pardew is talking about progress. He has left his analysts working out how best to customise a new computer program which will allow the manager to pore over previous performances with his squad, \u00e0 la Gary Neville at his SkyPad, on a giant touchscreen television. The glorified tablet dominates the back wall of the main meeting room in the revamped complex.</p> <p>Across the canteen area, in their own corner of an open-plan office, Pardew\u2019s senior coaching team are sifting through scouting reports and preparing their summaries of Leicester City, opponents in waiting on Saturday.

As for the homework, checks will be made on the central server that those to feature against the champions have scrutinised video clips of their immediate opponents, accessible via an app on their smartphones. The level of detail is painstaking on what would otherwise appear, to lurch into Uefa parlance, a run-of-the-mill \u201cmatch day minus two\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a different world to dear old Mitcham all those years ago,\u201d says Pardew, reflecting fondly on Palace\u2019s base during his playing days, when strength and conditioning revolved more around dreaded cross-country runs on windswept Farthing Downs or weights in a dingy unheated gym. \u201cBut you have to be right at the cutting edge. There is more knowledge out there, and you\u2019ve got to use it or fall behind. That is what I\u2019m being allowed to do here, on and off the pitch. I\u2019ve been given the chance to make something special.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people ask me about England \u2026 well, if I was still at Newcastle, I\u2019d be pretty keen on that England job. But, with all this here, I\u2019m left thinking: \u2018Why would I really want to leave this club now?\u2019 Obviously, I\u2019d like to win trophies, and that\u2019s very difficult even if we did come ever so close last season. But that isn\u2019t the only way to measure success. Success can be a legacy. Maybe I can create one here so that, one day, people look back and say: \u2018When Pardew was there that was a great period for the club.\u2019 I remember the chief executive at Southampton after Nicola Cortese thanking me for the platform I left them. That recognition is always nice. That\u2019s like winning a trophy for me.\u201d</p> <p>It is 22 months since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/29/alan-pardew-newcastle-leave-crystal-palace\" title=\"\">Pardew walked away from Newcastle</a>, ninth in the top flight with average gates pushing 52,000, to return to his native south London and a club whose exploits first caught his imagination when Malcolm Allison, resplendent in his lucky fedora, took Palace to the 1976 FA Cup semi-finals. The team loitered just beneath the relegation cut-off but, if there had been any doubt about accepting the chairman Steve Parish\u2019s approach, a phone call with Tony Pulis offered reassurance. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/14/tony-pulis-crystal-palace-leaves\" title=\"\">He\u2019d walked away</a>, but told me: \u2018Pards, there\u2019s a lot of growing that club could do. You can definitely take them forward.\u2019 It reinforced what I\u2019d suspected. The fans\u2019 frustration with the owner [Mike Ashley] at Newcastle had turned to frustration with me and the owner, so the timing was right. And it wasn\u2019t as much of a gamble as people thought. If I could keep Palace up, we\u2019d be the only London-based Premier League team south of the river.\u201d That was achieved with a 10th-place finish, establishing a platform for progression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38342bedbaf8c311de9518f3acbae9437e84114b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38342bedbaf8c311de9518f3acbae9437e84114b/0_80_3434_2287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Mandanda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The signing last summer of Steve Mandanda, a sweeper-keeper, is regarded by Alan Pardew as crucial business. \u2018His distribution has changed the way we play,\u2019 the manager says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had spent his first summer back at Palace overseeing the upgrade of the training complex and, aside from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/10/crystal-palace-yohan-cabaye-paris-saint-germain\" title=\"\">the signing of Yohan Cabaye</a>, tweaking the playing squad. This time around, the changes implemented on the pitch have been more far-reaching. A team whose forte had been resilience and biting on the counterattack needed to impose themselves as they became more established at this level. That wretched run of league form, yielding two wins in 21 matches, over the second half of last season had convinced Pardew change was required. His mind had been made up long before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">FA Cup final was lost to Manchester United</a>. \u201cEveryone pointed to a contrast between the first and second halves of our season but, while that existed in terms of results, it didn\u2019t in terms of our ability to control games,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat that run showed me was we couldn\u2019t properly impose control, and the depth of quality wasn\u2019t there to cope with injuries.</p> <p>\u201cSo we reacted, in terms of the first team but also up and down the club. You can point to the transfer policy, which has obviously stepped up in terms of the personnel we\u2019re bringing in \u2013 Cabaye last summer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/crystal-palace-sign-christian-benteke-liverpool\" title=\"\">now Christian Benteke</a> \u2013 but you don\u2019t always get it right. When we finished fifth with Newcastle [in 2012] we felt changing Danny Simpson and getting in a better right-back would be the way forward. He left and, a few years later, became a Premier League title winner with Leicester. We joke about that when we see each other. So it\u2019s not just about bringing players in.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also about what we do on the training pitch, even down to the keep-balls being different. We\u2019re focusing on technique more, in recruitment and training across the age groups. We\u2019re close to a tie-in with a team in Spain who produce good young players with a view to setting up a cultural and coaching exchange with them, seeing what they do differently through the academy and into the first team. And then there are the changes to the current team\u2019s style out on the pitch.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll always be a good counterattacking team, a side at our best when in the lead, and trying to transform the approach without taking anything away from that threat is a challenge. I played here under Steve Coppell and even he\u2019d admit his teams were very rigid. We bashed it down the sides, we were uncompromising, we pushed high up the pitch and put loads of crosses in the box. Well, we\u2019ve retained a bit of that because we\u2019re still the leading crossers in the Premier League. But what\u2019s wrong with asking players to use their imagination, their game intelligence, as well as oomph and spirit? I don\u2019t just want them to do basic things. I\u2019m asking them to do complicated things.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When people ask me about England ... well, if I was still at Newcastle, I\u2019d be pretty keen on that England job</p> <footer> <cite>Alan Pardew</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The summer signing who sets the tone is not Benteke at the team\u2019s pinnacle, but Steve Mandanda at the other end. The Frenchman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/01/crystal-palace-andros-townsend-alan-pardew\" title=\"\">secured for \u00a31.4m from Marseille</a>, is so comfortable with the ball at his feet that Pardew could argue he, rather than Pep Guardiola, kickstarted the summer\u2019s fad for sweeper-keepers in English football. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we got a free run at him: he\u2019s a France international; he\u2019s been in Ligue 1\u2019s equivalent of the PFA team of the year five times; he was captain of Marseille, a legend in the eyes of their fans. There is no mystery to this player. I told the chairman: \u2018This guy will force us to play. Even if one or two of our players are a bit tentative and might not show for the ball, he\u2019ll give it to them anyway. So they\u2019d best be ready.\u2019 His distribution has changed the way we play.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to make radical changes to the team\u2019s style is risky, I know. But it\u2019s not a risk without reward: a fifth year in the top flight, the most this club has ever had in one stretch, and another bonus in terms of the money to take the team forward. Playing as we did would get us 14th, 15th, all being well. Now, we could still finish 14th, but we would still have taken the club forward [in terms of the style]. It becomes more about keeping this group together. If I can do that for two years, and add to it in January and the summer, we\u2019ll have a great chance of Europe. It\u2019s about whether I can keep them fit, and whether or not, for example, a Paris Saint-Germain comes knocking for Christian if he scores 20 goals. If that happens he\u2019s gone and I\u2019ve got to find another player within our budget. Those things can happen. But, at the moment, we\u2019ve built a good ship and it\u2019s steaming in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>The strength of Pardew\u2019s relationship with Parish is key. \u201cI speak to managers at bigger clubs who don\u2019t have a good time, or even the same level of communication, with their chairmen,\u201d he says. But there is regular dialogue, too, with the American investors Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who are consulted on all the major decisions. They recognise the need to redevelop Selhurst Park, plans which are edging closer to becoming concrete. They pushed for Benteke\u2019s record \u00a327m purchase and eventually considered Mandanda\u2019s signing \u201ca no-brainer\u201d. \u201cAmericans are analytical in their sports, which are very stop-start, so the numbers tend to add up,\u201d says Pardew. \u201cThat\u2019s why Moneyball works for baseball. It doesn\u2019t work so well for football because it\u2019s a fluid game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78f5c859c5cd241c2d6dc6461337492b529ac550\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78f5c859c5cd241c2d6dc6461337492b529ac550/0_0_5220_3564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Pardew\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Pardew would like to coach abroad before he retires: \u2018My agent is always going on at me to learn Spanish and have that in my locker \u2026 but the States are getting bigger, China\u2019s getting bigger, the market\u2019s getting bigger.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo the stats don\u2019t always tell the whole picture.

It\u2019s about having the right numbers, the right athleticism, the right fit for this particular club.

The redevelopment of the stadium is a big phase for them, and they\u2019re big into community and producing our own talent.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\" title=\"\">final presidential debate</a>, thankfully the last set piece in a wretched campaign, revealed what is admirable and loathsome in American politics. Hillary Clinton displayed a razor-sharp intelligence and a quick wit. Her facility with facts trumped Donald Trump\u2019s lack of them. Americans finally saw on Wednesday why Secretary Clinton had got rich from giving lectures after leaving office. Her fluency with words, which has earned her $22m in speaking fees, appeared to silence her opponent. Mr Trump, a boastful, thin-skinned billionaire who trades in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\" title=\"\">racism</a> and misogyny, was left squawking on the sidelines of the debate. His jibes revealed a&#xa0;man out of his depth. His answer was to plunge down deeper. By disgracefully refusing to rule out calling this a rigged election he gave up a fight he had by then lost.</p> <p>Americans should vote for Secretary Clinton as an able and proven politician. A Trump presidency would be bad for America and dangerous for the world, so a vote for Secretary Clinton is the most effective way of preventing it. Mr Trump has been exposed for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">questionable tax arrangements</a>, outrageous business practices and irregularities at his charity. The billionaire is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\" title=\"\">grabber and kisser</a> of women who he presumed gave consent because he was famous. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\" title=\"\">numerous allegations</a> of sexual assault by Mr Trump. He has demonstrated that he has neither the conscience, training nor sense of history \u2013 and the desire to be judged well by it \u2013 to occupy the White House. Secretary Clinton possesses such attributes. She has a serious and sustained commitment on issues like education, healthcare and equality, and she has stood consistently for the rights of women, ethnic minorities, children and the disabled through her long career.</p> <p>However, there are fewer reasons to vote for Secretary Clinton than one would have hoped. For more than two decades she has been part of a political establishment that shaped a dysfunctional country. She has been unable to escape being tarnished by the most damaging policies \u2013 notably around <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36020717\" title=\"\">criminal justice</a> \u2013 of&#xa0;her husband\u2019s administration. There are well-founded concerns, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\" title=\"\">highlighted by transcripts of her speeches</a>, that she is too close to Wall Street to be an effective check on&#xa0;its excesses if&#xa0;elected.</p> <h2>The mood for change</h2> <p>Even so, as the first female president she would represent a symbolic transformative change in American politics. In some ways what Secretary Clinton has had to deal with are ingrained cultural attitudes about what success and leadership look like. These were exposed by the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\" title=\"\">finding that Mr Trump would win if only men voted</a> and Secretary Clinton would win if only women voted. That most men favor Mr&#xa0;Trump over Secretary Clinton demonstrates at some level a more insidious sexism than the one Mr Trump peddles: that centred on the mind, not the body. It is a hostility \u2013 deeply embedded but rarely conceded \u2013 against seeing women as genuinely equal.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the 2016 presidential campaign has been one of the most confrontational contests of the modern era. The mood for change has been more pervasive and volatile, and has been supercharged by Mr Trump, a braggart with tyrannical instincts. The backdrop to this election has been genuine and understandable public anger about economic insecurity, growing inequality and frustration with elites. Mr Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left have reflected that mood in their very different ways. That is not going to disappear after 8 November. The election has also raised real questions about the crisis of American democracy. Mr Trump encouraged violence against opponents and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">threatened to jail Secretary Clinton</a> if he took office.</p> <p>The civility that has marked out US democracy as ordered and restrained appears dead. The next president will have to resurrect it. The political topography of a polarized and resentful nation has been obscured by the preternatural equanimity of Barack Obama. Mr Trump has in some ways skilfully exploited these divisions. On social security he has moved to the left on the campaign trail, telling jobless Americans that he would <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2016/08/08/social-security-where-clinton-and-trump-stand/#6dbc02aa4f40\" title=\"\">not touch their benefits</a>. Mr Trump also wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the landmark measure that increases health coverage for low-wage workers and benefits <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/health/immigrants-the-poor-and-minorities-gain-sharply-under-health-act.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">large numbers of immigrants and minorities</a>. This contrasts with the real estate magnate\u2019s offer to expand the US health programme for the elderly \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20161020/clinton-trump-tangle-on-preserving-medicare\" title=\"\">Medicare</a> \u2013 which benefits overwhelmingly older, whiter voters.</p> <p>These dog whistles have been part of American politics for decades. But they come at a time when there is a sense that there are too many losers from economic growth in the country. Driving discontent in the US is a system that no longer defuses high levels of inequality with opportunities for all. The&#xa0;middle classes <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-13/u-s-poverty-rate-falls-to-post-recession-low-as-incomes-gain\" title=\"\">are poorer today than in 2000</a>. Since the Great Recession the top <a href=\"http://equitablegrowth.org/research-analysis/u-s-top-one-percent-of-income-earners-hit-new-high-in-2015-amid-strong-economic-growth/\" title=\"\">1% of families in the US have captured 52% of the income growth</a>. There\u2019s understandable anger that the wealthy were bailed out while ordinary Americans were hollowed out. Voters rage that, in the current incarnation of globalization, jobs that disappeared when the US decided to import rather than manufacture did not come back \u2013 they simply popped up elsewhere, usually in China.</p> <h2>The Sanders effect</h2> <p>Nowhere has this fury been more keenly felt than in the country\u2019s former manufacturing heartlands, tapping into America\u2019s long history of resistance to free trade and making protectionism a potent political force once again. The politician who has shaped the politics of the country and accounted for populist anger is Senator Sanders. The man from Vermont understood, earlier than most, that voters see the economy as rigged against them by a political system that has been corrupted by big money. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/06/03/the-democrats-generation-gap/\" title=\"\">His campaign was backed three to one by millennials in the Democratic primaries</a>. This month his favorability ratings in opinion polls <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/cx4orjzwhb/econTabReport.pdf\" title=\"\">are only bettered by Michelle&#xa0;Obama</a>.</p> <p>Senator Sanders\u2019 insurgent campaign has transformed Democratic politics \u2013 forcing Secretary Clinton to adopt, albeit sotto voce, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-election-democrats-sanders-commentary-idUSKCN0Y90C9\" title=\"\">key planks of his program</a> such as a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour, tuition-free public college and opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 President Obama\u2019s big trade deal. Until this week, Secretary Clinton failed to outline enough of a bold reform program. Tellingly, she offered signs of one in the final televised debate, making unprompted promises to push immigration reforms, a key Sanders point, within the first 100 days of her presidency.</p> <p>Although domestic politics has framed the campaign, Secretary Clinton\u2019s election would be greeted with relief and optimism in most world capitals other than Moscow and Damascus. Despite her <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/hillary-the-hawk-a-history-clinton-2016-military-intervention-libya-iraq-syria/\" title=\"\">hawkish outlook</a>, she will have no alternative but to recognize that the 21st century no longer always looks to the United States as an indispensable hegemon, whether benign or threatening. Secretary Clinton should focus on US soft, not hard, power \u2013 dealing with climate change and working out fairer global trade arrangements.</p> <p>If Secretary Clinton is elected she must recognize the mood without pandering to its demons. She needs to bring the bold ambition about the role of government to this era that Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt each did in earlier times. She has the intelligence, the seriousness and the experience to do this. The&#xa0;US presidency is hugely powerful: 10% of all posts in federal government are allocated on the basis of political patronage. Secretary Clinton offers the best chance of ensuring those jobs go to competent people. Her choice of Treasury secretary in the aftermath of the banking crisis will be watched with special care, as will an olive branch appointment to Senator Sanders of the kind that president Obama made to her in 2008. She offers the greatest hope that the supreme court defends abortion rights and looks again at issues like campaign finance as well as background checks on gun owners. Yet America will soon find itself weakened at home and abroad if the new president is as badly served by congress as Mr Obama has been for most of his tenure.</p> <p>There is a danger, if Mrs Clinton wins, that&#xa0;the Republicans will relapse into the Hillary-hatred that has marked them for a quarter century. The tragedy of this election is&#xa0;that, to become president, Secretary Clinton has had to talk more radically than she actually felt; to be an effective president she may be compelled to act more conservatively than she&#xa0;now says she wants to do.</p>",

  "<p>A Mississippi woman is appealing a district court\u2019s ruling that her nearly 100-day incarceration in a county jail, without being offered bail or an attorney, did not violate her civil rights.</p> <p>The ruling, handed down by district judge Sharion Aycock last month, outlines a little known gap in constitutional law that in certain scenarios can lead to extremely long pre-trial detention periods for minor crimes, for no compelling reason.</p> <p>Despite the fact that the woman, 34-year-old Jessica Jauch, was only accused of the sale of a small quantity of prescription drugs, county officials held her for more than three months due to the county\u2019s own scheduling convenience, as the criminal court was out of session at the time of her arrest. </p> <p>Aycock\u2019s ruling that this was not a violation of her rights has deeply troubled civil liberties activists and scholars, who are now looking to use the case to highlight some of the most unfair and under-discussed practices of the criminal justice system.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe supreme court has never specifically said, this is the amount of time the court has to provide a prompt bail hearing,\u201d said Brandon Buskey, a senior staff attorney at the Criminal Law Reform Project of the ACLU.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of this void where the states can make up their own rules. But one would think that the time to have a prompt bail hearing is prior to three months after they\u2019ve been taken into custody,\u201d Buskey said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/traffic-courts-low-income-people-minorities-california\">California judge who mocked blind man emblematic of failed traffic court system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jauch was arrested for misdemeanor traffic offenses in Starkville, Mississippi, in April of 2012. Shortly after her arrest, authorities located a felony drug warrant for Jauch out of Choctaw County, one county over from where she had been picked up, and transferred her to the custody of the sheriff there.</p> <p>According to Jauch\u2019s court filings, from the moment she was transferred to the Choctaw County jail, she asserted her innocence to anyone who would listen, and asked to be taken before a judge so she could post bail. The county sheriff, Cloyd Halford, allegedly told Jauch and her friend that he did not have to take Jauch before a judge until the next court term, which was about three months away. At no point during this time was Jauch provided an attorney.</p> <p>The warrant Jauch was being held for was issued over an alleged drug sale of eight tablets of alprazolam, a commonly prescribed anti-anxiety drug widely known by its trade name, Xanax. An informant told prosecutors that Jauch had sold her the tablets for $40, and prosecutors managed to secure a grand jury indictment for Jauch, likely based on this testimony, although it can\u2019t be sure exactly what evidence jurors heard, as grand jury proceedings are confidential in the US.</p> <p>Prosecutors also stressed that videotape existed of the transaction which clearly showed the transaction.</p> <p>Sheriff Halford allegedly told Jauch\u2019s mother that they had her daughter \u201cdead to rights\u201d committing the crime on video \u201cand that she was going to prison for a long time and was a terrible person\u201d, according to Jauch\u2019s complaint.</p> <p>But once Jauch was finally taken to court, 96 days later, the state\u2019s case utterly crumbled. Her newly appointed counsel watched the videotape and found that it depicted no such crime, and in fact merely showed Jauch borrowing $40 from a friend. That friend, who was the state\u2019s confidential informant, had, as the complaint alleges, \u201cused her own narcotic pain pills to frame Ms Jauch in order to gain leniency for her own crimes\u201d.</p> <p>After Jauch\u2019s attorney brought the contents of the tape to the prosecutor, the charges were promptly dropped.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The deeper problem is that when people get those bail hearings, they\u2019re often meaningless because they are unaffordable</p> <footer> <cite>Alec Karakatsanis, Civil Rights Corps</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the failure of prosecutors to either watch or disclose the contents of the video is troubling, none of the facts of the failed indictment are particularly novel. Prosecutors routinely secure shaky indictments of suspects that are later dropped. But for Jauch, this bad indictment meant losing three months of her life without even being offered the possibility to secure a pre-trial release, a right that Jauch\u2019s suit against the county claimed are guaranteed by the fourth, sixth, eighth and 14th amendments to the constitution.</p> <p>But Aycock, the district judge, dismissed those claims one by one in her decision. She argued, among other things, that because Jauch was indicted by a grand jury she lost her right to a probable cause hearing under Mississippi law. Typically these hearings happen during the initial appearance before a judge when someone is arrested, and also include the setting of bail.</p> <p>But just because Jauch had lost her right to the former, Buskey said, it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the latter. The first part \u201conly answers the question of whether the initial custody was lawful\u201d, Buskey said. \u201cIn order to fully address this case you have to get at, how long is it legal to hold somebody before or after indictment without any kind of court process.\u201d</p> <p>Alec Karakatsanis, executive director of the Civil Rights Corps, said he thinks case law is on Jauch\u2019s side, citing language in the case of US v Salerno that declared access to pre-trial liberty a \u201cfundamental right\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cOnce you call something fundamental right, if the government wants to infringe that right, it has to meet strict scrutiny,\u201d Karakatsanis said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way that delaying [a bail hearing] more than a few days is going to be a narrowly tailored way of furthering any compelling government interest.\u201d</p> <p>Karakatsanis added that for all the problems Jauch\u2019s case raises, the fact is that many more Americans who are given bail hearings are still held in the same unnecessary limbo by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/justice-department-jail-bond-case-georgia-maurice-walker\">being offered bail so high they simply cannot pay.</a></p> <p>\u201cThe deeper problem is that when people get those bail hearings, they\u2019re often meaningless because they are unaffordable,\u201d Karakatsanis said. \u201cThis is all just indicative of a system that is indifferent to the horrific harm caused by locking people in cages.\u201d </p>",

He tells me 12 times in the first 15 minutes that the dental test is \u201calready being used by the government\u201d. In February, he explains, he heard about a court case in his constituency involving a young Afghan man accused of assault, who claimed to be a teenager but looked older. Davies duly tabled parliamentary questions, asking <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2016-02-19/27499/\">what proportion of asylum seekers had been suspected of making fraudulent claims to be under 18</a>. Of the 500-1,000 subjected to an age assessment each year, came the written answer, between half and two thirds were judged to be over 18.</p> <p>Now Davies gets out his iPad to show me a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257462/assessing-age.pdf\">gov.uk document about how to assess an asylum seeker\u2019s age</a>, which mentions that teeth can be X-rayed \u2013 or, alternatively, wrist bones. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think we can deny the test exists!\u201d Has the dental test been conducted on the Afghan in his constituency? \u201cNo. But look.\u201d He points at the webpage. \u201cIt\u2019s a test that\u2019s already used. And written answers to my questions appear to demonstrate that the test is being used in the UK on about 500 people a year. So I\u2019m not suggesting something new.\u201d</p> <p>He is simply suggesting that we X\u2013ray the teeth of all asylum seekers in Calais who look \u201csignificantly\u201d over 18. \u201cI mean, of course, if they say they\u2019re 17 and the X-ray says 19, we\u2019d give them the benefit of the doubt.\u201d The tests would be conducted by \u201cwhoever does it at the moment. It\u2019s already being done at the moment.\u201d But the BDA, I point out, says dentists cannot perform X-rays for non-medical purposes. \u201cThat\u2019s what they are saying \u2013 but it\u2019s my understanding that it\u2019s already in use.\u201d So dentists are already doing this? \u201cEither that,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cor they\u2019re doing the wrist test.\u201d</p> <p>Disconcerted by my doubt, he presses: \u201cWould you not say that is the implication of what I\u2019ve got here?\u201d I read the gov.uk webpage closely. It comes at the very bottom of a 17-page list of non-medical methods typically used to determine an asylum seeker\u2019s age, and states that \u201cin some instances\u201d an applicant may choose to challenge the findings of those methods by submitting dental X-rays. There is no suggestion here, nor in anything else he shows me on his iPad, that X-ray dental tests can or ever have been imposed on anyone in this country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/21/david-davies-gay-marriage-interview\">David Davies, Conservative MP: 'I may well be wrong'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Davies looks taken aback. \u201cOh. Oh that\u2019s interesting. You could be right there.\u201d He leans in to study the text on his screen. \u201cMmmm. You could be right.\u201d</p> <p>After 11 years in parliament, the Welshman retains an amateurishly naive air that is both likable and troubling. He reminds me a lot of Alan Partridge. When I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/21/david-davies-gay-marriage-interview\">first interviewed him four years ago</a>, he had just called gay marriage \u201cbarking mad\u201d on Radio Wales, and was astonished by the exception taken to his assertion that \u201cmost parents would prefer their children not to be gay\u201d. Now, as then, the cold certainties of his rightwing pronouncements are difficult to square with their tentative, self-effacing delivery. But if he had seemed out of his depth in 2012, his guilelessness today feels more like the self-belief of someone who knows that even if people still don\u2019t like what he says, now they have to listen.</p> <p>Notwithstanding his misreading of current practice, if a dental test is such an innocuous idea, why does he think it has caused uproar? He considers this in silence for eight seconds. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to ask your readers. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be the first to get angry about it.\u201d Some critics have suggested a dental test evokes slave traders examining teeth in order to determine a slave\u2019s market value. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not the case at all.\u201d Then there are its echoes of concentration camps where Nazis plundered Jews\u2019 teeth for their gold. Davies looks amazed. \u201cI just don\u2019t see this at all. I think some people are trying to make a rather tortuous analogy here. I just don\u2019t get that at all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecb971beef8f32b4f813e19eccb77b1cd61d4527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecb971beef8f32b4f813e19eccb77b1cd61d4527/24_291_3459_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young refugee who arrived from the \u2018Jungle\u2019 camp in Calais.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young refugee who arrived from the \u2018Jungle\u2019 camp in Calais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then he brightens. \u201cShould I try to say, \u2018If dental tests are causing an issue and the wrist test is accurate, let\u2019s go with the wrist one\u2019? I don\u2019t really mind. I can\u2019t really see the analogy with slavery or concentration camps \u2013 but if that is the main sticking point here, fine, let\u2019s do wrists! I don\u2019t mind me being tested, by the way. No, no, no. Bring it on. If someone thinks this is outrageous, well I\u2019ll be the first to volunteer. Come and X-ray my wrist! Have a look at my teeth! People are saying this is a really intrusive thing to do \u2013 well, I don\u2019t feel intruded upon. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p> <p>Davies talks as if oblivious to any connection between how refugees are discussed in Westminster and treated in public. The purpose of a dental test, he keeps saying, is not to \u201ckeep people out\u201d but to ensure that provision intended for migrant children is not misappropriated by sharp-elbowed adults. But however good his intentions, or pragmatic his proposal, does he not see that talk of mandatory dental tests dehumanises refugees? That when discussing the most vulnerable of youngsters, tone matters as much as logic?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m slightly concerned that this argument is being used to stifle debate, and that stifling of debate is likely to cause anger. I saw it when people said the Leave campaign might not have encouraged hate crime, but that there\u2019s a correlation between the Leavers and hate crimes. And I refute this.\u201d He sees no causal link between the referendum and the dramatic spike in hate crimes? \u201cNo. I think it\u2019s a case of people who lost the referendum trying to use the allegation that their opponents have caused totally unacceptable crimes to shut down debate. And I sense this happening again now. I worry slightly that anyone who raises any kind of concern at all about this is immediately sort of likened to a Nazi slave trader or to someone who supports violence. For the record,\u201d he adds, channelling pure Partridge, \u201cI\u2019m totally and utterly opposed to hate crimes of any sort.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/hate-surged-after-eu-referendum-police-figures-show\">He doesn\u2019t think hate crimes have gone up at all</a>. \u201cThe government has just made them easier to report.\u201d</p> <p>Before entering parliament, Davies had been a Territorial Army soldier, a special constable and a lorry driver for his father\u2019s haulage company. His approach to a debate is anecdotal rather than academic, with a tendency to fixate upon individual sources or details that risks making him come across as rather credulous. Someone told him that an asylum seeker in Wales with grey hair had claimed to be 17, and he references this constantly. He believes our courts use dental tests because \u201can MP who\u2019s a lawyer told me\u201d, and when I ask for examples of British \u201chospitality being abused\u201d, he reverts back to the case of the Afghan asylum seeker in Monmouthshire. The sexual significance of owning Erasure albums had preoccupied him greatly during our previous interview about gay marriage, and now he appears to have inferred an awful lot from one gesture a migrant made to him during a recent visit to \u201cthe Jungle\u201d camp in Calais.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b42ff2ccf3a230f151bd79e351af43f0edd58520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b42ff2ccf3a230f151bd79e351af43f0edd58520/234_497_6325_3796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Davies addressing the Welsh Conservatives spring conference earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davies addressing the Welsh Conservatives spring conference earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI asked one person why he came, and he made a gesture to suggest he would find it easier here to find cash-in-hand.\u201d Davies also saw a caravan that displayed a sign offering to coach asylum seekers in what to say to UK immigration officers. \u201cSo, it\u2019s obvious that people are looking for ways to circumvent the rules. They want to come to the UK for a better standard of living.

  "<p>At 66 years old, Duncan Foster thought his hitchhiking days were over. He would regularly thumb a lift to watch football matches as far away as Leeds (60 miles as the crow flies) as a young lad growing up in Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria.</p> <p>But as a pensioner, now living alone in the nearby village of Whittington, he was happy to rely on the bus to go for a few pints with old mates back in Kirkby. With 111 services passing through the village each week, including one handily timed around last orders, he could maintain his social life without drink-driving \u2013 or forking out \u00a36 for a taxi for the three-mile journey to and from Kirkby.</p> <p>All that changed in April, when Lancashire county council drastically cut bus subsidies, which resulted in Whittington suddenly receiving just five buses a week, all one-way. Foster was outraged. But instead of sulking at home \u2013 or switching to soft drinks at the pub and taking the car \u2013 he decided to start a one-man protest.</p> <p>He paid \u00a38 for a hi-vis reflective jacket on which he had printed \u201clift please \u2013 no buses\u201d, and stood at the largely dormant bus stop with his thumb out hoping to be picked up. It nearly always worked, with the retired building site engineer getting lifts from friends and strangers alike.</p> <p>Less intrepid residents unable to drive find themselves stuck at home or forced to move, he said. \u201cI know one gentleman had to move because he needed to get to Kendal for hospital appointments.

In Cumbria, the bus budget is now zero, down from almost \u00a31.84m in 2010-11.

Steve Hurst, from the market town of Rothbury, started Spirit Buses \u201cto plug a gap\u201d in the Coquetdale valley.</p> <p>But on 5 November, the Spirit Bus will make its final journey after carrying 50,000 passengers in its two-year life. Hurst is throwing in the towel after accepting he could not continue to offer a service that paid him no salary. Almost 31, he still lives with his parents. According to his dad, Rich, who runs a deli in Rothbury, he draws no salary and relies almost entirely on \u201cthe bank of mum and dad\u201d to survive. His parents even make him his daily packed lunch. \u201cI\u2019m in debt, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d said Hurst on Friday, talking on hands-free as he drove the bus.</p> <p>Hurst had hoped to win another contract to run a service between Morpeth and Rothbury, opening up economies of scale that would have made his two rural routes financially viable. But Northumberland council awarded the contract to Arriva, saying it offered better value for money, despite Hurst having run a 100% reliable service for the previous year, compared with Arriva, which had a reputation for frequent breakdowns and delays. Whether out of spite or thoughtlessness, Arriva celebrated by changing the timetables so that its buses no longer linked with Spirit\u2019s at the key interchange town of Morpeth, resulting in a drastic fall in custom for Spirit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a133691d62886bab5d55d154983d7a0bb3d03519\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a133691d62886bab5d55d154983d7a0bb3d03519/0_494_5628_3346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Coquetdale circular bus route running through rural Northumberland from Rothbury.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"595\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Coquetdale circular bus route running through rural Northumberland from Rothbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI feel tremendously sad to be packing it in.

The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bus-services-bill-overview\">bus services bill</a> going through parliament should address this, he said. \u201cOf course you do need the big operators, but you can\u2019t expect little independents to put on these lifeline services and not make a profit while the big operators make loads. Either the big operators need to be told that they have to also operate the lifeline services, or the independents need more help.\u201d</p> <p>Passengers are sorry to see Hurst give up. \u201cSpirit Buses will be a huge miss on our roads,\u201d said one regular on Spirit\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cYou did a community service, not just a bus service. I have seen you deliver parcels to outlying villages, you provide weather reports &amp; beautiful photos.

He decided to leave the tabard at home, sharing a taxi with local retired couple John and Maureen Keegan, both 76, who now make just one weekly shopping trip into Kirkby Lonsdale each Friday because of the bus cuts. On Friday morning John had put the finishing touches to a homemade timetable he and Foster had devised, which proposed altering existing services in the Lune Valley to give four services a day instead of just one.</p> <p>Buses are a lifeline for villages like Whittington, said Keegan, which has lost its pub and has a pop-up post office that opens for just two hours a week in the village hall. \u201cNowadays there are an ever-decreasing number of services in rural villages, with shops, post offices, GP practices and pubs shutting down all the time. Buses have never been more vital for people to access these services elsewhere.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Play It Loud: An Epic History of the Style, Sound, &amp; Revolution of the Electric Guitar is just that: a swooping, all-encompassing timeline of the instrument\u2019s early days to its beyond-essential role in pop culture and music. Written by Brad Tolinski and Alan Di Perna, with a foreword by Carlos Santana, the book dives into the electric guitar\u2019s place in our society, tracing its evolution in sound, style, look and purpose. Here are 10 things we learned from reading:</p> <p><strong>Leo Fender didn\u2019t know how to play guitar. </strong>The inventor of the famous guitar brand, which includes the Telecaster and Stratocaster models (favored by Kurt Cobain and Jimi Hendrix), never learned how to play his own instrument. Fender began as an accountant with a knack for repairing radios, later turning that hobby into a full-time electronics operation. The highly versatile Telecaster, which he developed in 1950, became the first mass-produced solid-body electric guitar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/19/how-the-world-plugged-into-the-electric-guitar\">How the world plugged into the electric guitar</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The sounds of the electric guitar made it to outer space. </strong>In 1977, both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched into space with remnants of international life and culture onboard. On each vessel was a gold-plated phonograph record with 115 sounds and images curated by a team led by astronomer Carl Sagan. Along with selections that included the likes of Bach and Beethoven, Sagan decided to throw in \u2013 however controversial it was at the time \u2013 Johnny B Goode by Chuck Berry, an American rock\u2019n\u2019roll anthem defined by its rollicking electric guitar lick.</p> <p><strong>George Delmetia Beauchamp is just as important as Leo Fender and Les Paul.</strong> His name may not ring a bell, but Beauchamp designed the first fully functional guitar pickup and secured a US patent for the electric guitar in 1937. The pickup, which converts string vibrations into amplifiable electrical signals, makes an electric guitar what it is; without one, there is no electric guitar. Beauchamp was also a founder of the popular Rickenbacker guitar brand alongside his friend and business partner Adolph Rickenbacker. Rickenbackers were often seen in use by both John Lennon and Paul McCartney in the era of the Beatles, also a go-to guitar for the classic rock sound of bands including the Who, the Eagles and Steppenwolf.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/01/how-the-electric-guitar-i-threw-away-20-years-ago-found-its-way-back-to-me\">How the electric guitar I threw away 20 years ago found its way home</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Hawaii was key in the development of the electric guitar. </strong>There was a giant Hawaiian craze in the 1910s and 1920s, with a rise in popularity of the island\u2019s sounds and culture (as often seen in movies and Broadway performances). Integral to Hawaiian music is the Hawaiian-style steel guitar, which most of early electric guitar development modeled itself after.</p> <p><strong>The first electric guitar was made out of cast aluminum.</strong> Hitting the market in 1932, the A-25 was also called the \u201cFrying Pan\u201d.</p> <p><strong>People didn\u2019t like the Les Paul Trio at first. </strong>With a thrice-weekly performance slot on NBC\u2019s Fred Waring\u2019s radio program, The Chesterfield Hour, listeners often wrote in to complain about the \u201cstrange and unpleasant sound of the newfangled electric guitar Les Paul was playing\u201d. In the late 1930s, there were many demands to fire him; today, the Les Paul guitar brand is an essential part of pop culture, and Paul himself is both in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c8da5499d7286c2926c3bee50dc0bce186e5837\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c8da5499d7286c2926c3bee50dc0bce186e5837/0_0_600_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Clapton\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Eric Clapton was in a bad mood during the photoshoot for Blues Breakers. </strong>The 1966 Clapton/John Mayall collaboration sees Clapton on the album art reading a copy of UK comic book the Beano.

Nicknamed \u201cThe Beano Album\u201d, it\u2019s often considered to be one of the most important guitar recordings ever made.</p> <p><strong>The Beatles made the very first rock record with guitar feedback. </strong>1964\u2019s I Feel Fine has a sound that was accidentally discovered by the band and put to use on the single, thanks to their open-minded producer George Martin.</p> <p><strong>Pete Townshend turned his guitar into a machine gun.</strong> That was the actual sound he went after, slamming his guitars into speaker cabinets and toggling the pickup-selector switch violently. \u201cTo me the guitar was a symbol,\u201d explained the Who\u2019s lead guitarist. \u201cIt was a metaphor for a machine gun. And the only thing you could do with a machine gun in the 60s was break it across your legs. That\u2019s what I did.\u201d You can hear these specific sonic strategies on songs like My Generation and Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere.</p> <p><strong>Jimi Hendrix\u2019s first Stratocaster was one of Keith Richards\u2019 guitars.</strong> The white instrument was given to him by Linda Keith, Richards\u2019 girlfriend at the time. Hendrix had wanted one for years because it was played by two of his biggest idols, Buddy Guy and Otis Rush. Supposedly, it was given to Hendrix without Richards knowing.</p>",

Now divided into flats, they were once the heart of a community \u2013 and the names of these houses (Birch, Aster, Ivy, The Lodge) may yet become synonymous with cruelty, child abuse, incompetence and cover-up.</p> <p>Of all the scandals being investigated by the inquiry chaired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/11/child-abuse-inquiry-prof-alexis-jay-to-take-over-from-lowell-goddard\">Prof Alexis Jay</a>, this has the potential to be the most disturbing of all. The secrets of Shirley Oaks appear to be slowly emerging from some of the thousands of children who grew up in what used to be Britain\u2019s biggest care home.</p> <p>Raymond Stevenson was one of them. His parents split up when he was two years old. He and his older brother stayed with his father, but it was too much for a working dad. And so the two of them were put into Shirley Oaks, just outside Croydon. It would be Stevenson\u2019s home until he was 18.<br></p> <p>The 80-acre site, with its cottages, swimming pool and school, should have given him the start in life his parents could not. But like many of his friends, he wanted to forget the place when he left, and bury the things he had experienced there. Those memories remained out of reach until two years ago.</p> <p>Stevenson was at his flat in Brixton one evening when he received a phone call. \u201cA boy I had kept in touch with rang me out of the blue,\u201d he says. \u201cHe told me he had something to say.\u201d</p> <p>The caller explained that he had been sexually abused at Shirley Oaks, and that his brother and sister had, too. At first, Stevenson was shocked \u2013 and then enraged. He smashed up his flat. He knew this story was just the tip of the iceberg: that the history he had forgotten would grow to take over his entire life.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d lived with it all these years and he was at the end of his tether,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cHe had come to me for help \u2026 and he knew I couldn\u2019t turn him down.\u201d</p> <p>He was right. In his peer group, and around south London, Stevenson has a reputation. He made his name as a music manager \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/mentors-massive-price-tag-for-jessie-j-6423139.html\">he discovered and nurtured Jessie J</a>. He\u2019d earned respect for standing up to criminals who once tried to strong-arm him out of a nightclub he ran, and he had worked with the Home Office on an anti-gun crime campaign video. Those who have crossed Stevenson know him to be stubborn and street-smart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e22fda0c2d984128e4407562fdccea98d3e3953f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e22fda0c2d984128e4407562fdccea98d3e3953f/1117_148_1432_1790/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Cornish, AKA Jessie J, in 2003 when Raymond Stevenson was her mentor.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Cornish, AKA Jessie J, in 2003, when Raymond Stevenson was her mentor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the work that would become his calling, Stevenson, now 53, would have to prove it. Within days of that first call, he and his long-term business partner, Lucia Hinton, put their business to one side and set about finding out as much as possible about Shirley Oaks, the people who ran it and the children who went through it.</p> <p>And because it was \u201cRaymond from Shirley Oaks\u201d making inquiries, people who hadn\u2019t dared to come forward before, or felt they had been let down by the authorities and the police in the past, have told him their stories.</p> <p>So far almost 700 former residents of Shirley Oaks have approached him \u2013 and the support group he set up \u2013 Shirley Oaks Survivors Association (<a href=\"http://www.shirleyoakssurvivorsassociation.co.uk/\">SOSA</a>) \u2013 has taken testimony about abuse from 400. They include two army officers, and two others awarded MBEs. And more emerge every day.</p> <p>What they believe they can prove \u2013 from witness testimony, from hundreds of pages of official documents that have been leaked to them, and from former staff and \u201chouse parents\u201d who now support them \u2013 is that Shirley Oaks was infiltrated by paedophiles from the mid-1950s until its closure in 1983. They have identified 60 suspected paedophiles; there may be more. One of the abusers is said to be a former member of Scotland Yard\u2019s vice squad. And the abuse didn\u2019t stop at Shirley Oaks. It wormed its way into all of Lambeth\u2019s children\u2019s homes, and continued until the early 1990s.</p> <p>Are all the claims true? Stevenson has no reason to doubt them. And neither, it seems, does Lambeth council, which ran Shirley Oaks for 20 years, or the police, who are desperate to speak to the survivors who have come to him.</p> <p>In fact, SOSA compiled a report that so horrified the council that it has agreed in principle to pay compensation to potentially hundreds of victims. The material uncovered by the group, now compiled into six lengthy reports, is one reason why Lambeth is <a href=\"http://www.shirleyoakssurvivorsassociation.co.uk/iicsa\">among Jay\u2019s core investigations</a>.</p> <p>Stevenson has no doubt about what they show. \u201cThis was about the industrial sexual abuse of children in a home,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t need high-profile names to be one of the worst, one of the most disgusting things that has happened \u2026 it was another world, horrible.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson had a partial view of this when he was growing up. He recalls being beaten and knowing \u201cfrom the age of six that there was something wrong\u201d with the way children were treated. \u201cI was not aware that people were being sexually abused, but as I got older, we were aware that there were places you shouldn\u2019t go because of the potential for sexual abuse. There were houses \u2013 the lodge house, the boiler house \u2013 there were those places that we knew had the potential for that.</p> <p>\u201cThese were dark houses, dark cottages that we would never go to. Some of my friends lived in those cottages, so I\u2019d wait round by a tree until they came out. It\u2019s only in hindsight that you know that everyone who left their cottage left all the evil inside.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b170a23d924c35cc4db958d55e421e39cab7856f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b170a23d924c35cc4db958d55e421e39cab7856f/0_0_2192_1316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It was a failed system, and with failed systems people can take advantage\u2019 \u2026 Shirley Oaks children\u2019s home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was a failed system, and with failed systems people can take advantage\u2019 \u2026 Shirley Oaks children\u2019s home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: shirleyoaks.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says the children didn\u2019t talk about what was happening. \u201cThere was nothing to talk about. It was like going to the shops. The beatings were part of the system \u2013 you couldn\u2019t question it because there was nothing to compare it with. So you accepted it.\u201d Instead, he says, \u201cwe tried to live proud\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe all wanted to project that survival instinct,\u201d he says. \u201cYou suffered in silence together, and you protected each other as much as you could. My best friends didn\u2019t know about the nights I spent locked in the coalshed. They didn\u2019t know about the nights I wandered around in the dark. Why would I tell them? They had their own nightmares to deal with.</p> <p>\u201cRemember, many of the kids at Shirley Oaks had been abused already. That\u2019s why they were there. They didn\u2019t know any different. It was supposedly normal, because we were children who didn\u2019t deserve anything more than what we got. I had no concept of cruelty. It was normal to me. It was all I knew, the walls of Shirley Oaks.\u201d</p> <p>This was not the vision that Shirley Oaks\u2019s founders had had in the early 20th century. Opened in 1904 by the Bermondsey Board of Guardians, it was designed as beacon of progressiveness that would allow children to \u201cbe brought up in a home environment rather than a large, regimented institution \u2026 living in small groups with house parents, on a site including school, workshops, administration block, infirmary etc, in a self-contained community.\u201d With up to 400 children on site at any time, the home was a new way to deal with vulnerable and troubled children from boroughs all over London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"524bcca450db4a639eeb941fe621d5acc4624cfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/524bcca450db4a639eeb941fe621d5acc4624cfc/0_468_2840_3547/801.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Jay, head of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation, which will investigate the history of Shirley Oaks.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Jay, head of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation, which will investigate the history of Shirley Oaks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Hunter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many thousands of them will have gone into and come out of Shirley Oaks unscathed \u2013 most of the \u201chouse parents\u201d likely did their best, with the best of intentions. Stevenson recalls two who had a profound effect on him \u2013 Aunty Charmaine and Uncle Bob \u2013 and prevented him from self-destructing.</p> <p>But during the 1960s and 70s in particular, the home appears to have been infected by what Stevenson calls \u201cthe virus of child abuse\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTheir (paedophile) network before the internet was perfect,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were in touch with each other, they knew each other, they were advertising for like-minded people. We know the word spread. People were directed to Shirley Oaks. We knew it had to be orchestrated. But we needed to know how. Once we got it, we could predict which children would be abused, which children were targeted.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson says he has been able to map which abusers went where and for how long \u2013 work, he says, that could have been done by the police or the council if they had ever had the appetite to do it. He insists they didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Hinton says talking to so many people about such personal matters has been \u201cfucking harrowing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe enormity of it \u2026 you have grown men who have never met me who are willing to share with me in graphic detail the horrific ordeals they have been put through,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is heart-wrenching for people to have to relive this. People don\u2019t understand that they don\u2019t just come in and say: \u2018This is what happened to me.\u2019 For some people it has taken months for them to pluck up courage. The first thing we did was get counselling in place and we take our time with them.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand they are damaged souls in their general life, aside from the abuse. I am a mum, I have two children. And the thought of children going through what these people have gone through \u2026 I am not sure grateful is the right word \u2026 but we are very grateful that they have felt able to trust us, to believe in what we are doing.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson adds: \u201cI know I couldn\u2019t have survived what some of the people have gone through, I know it. End of story. So I am not looking at someone who is a victim, I am looking at someone and thinking: \u2018My God, you have gone through all that, the least I can do is give you everything that I have.\u2019 Our mandate is unquestionable, we cannot fail. What happened to them is indisputable. The facts are there. We have to deliver them truth and justice. Because they handed us truth on a plate.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/aug/05/child-abuse-survivors-react-to-resignation-of-inquiry-chair-lowell-goddard-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4pj56\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2631831\"            data-video-name=\"Child abuse survivors react to resignation of inquiry chair Lowell Goddard \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC/ ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a471d2e4b06a087f2af360\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/05/160805ChildAbuseSurvivors_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/05/160805ChildAbuseSurvivors.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/05/160805ChildAbuseSurvivors_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/05/160805ChildAbuseSurvivors_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/05/160805ChildAbuseSurvivors_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/aug/05/child-abuse-survivors-react-to-resignation-of-inquiry-chair-lowell-goddard-video\">Child abuse survivors react to resignation of inquiry chair Lowell Goddard</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Stevenson is coy about his endgame, and how he intends to secure it. For him, getting compensation for the abused is a first step. What is less clear is where and how the anger of the people he represents will be directed next. It might be channelled through the national inquiry; some of his members may decide to talk to the police, though so far they have been reluctant. \u201cThey [the police] have been part of the problem, not the solution,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the moment, Stevenson says he is sitting on information that has the potential to shame authorities \u2013 and individuals \u2013 charged with protecting children in care. \u201cFrom very early on we knew the abuse could not be random. There were too many recurring themes that enabled it to go on, and it couldn\u2019t happen on such a scale and be random because these people kept bumping into each other.</p> <p>\u201cLambeth council was inept and corrupt. It was a perfect storm. We understood that Shirley Oaks was a failed system, and with failed systems people can take advantage. We learned that the problem was widespread and that we couldn\u2019t trust the police.\u201d</p> <p>He is mistrustful of the media, too: \u201cThey have gone for the wrong people at the wrong time, without enough evidence, which has really damaged everything.\u201d So Stevenson is doing things his way \u2013 toughened by all the things he has been through, and driven on by the survivors behind him. The combination is unsettling for the police, the council, the inquiry and the establishment he intends to rock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/08/hundreds-of-alleged-abuse-victims-threaten-to-boycott-jay-inquiry\">Hundreds of alleged abuse victims threaten to boycott Jay inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI can honestly say that the scars I carry from Shirley Oaks will be with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cBut they are nothing compared with the stories we have read and heard.

Inspectors reported that a small group of detainees said some staff used insulting, aggressive or racist language and that they felt unsafe in areas not covered by CCTV. </p> <p>Inspectors said the concerns raised were consistent with evidence presented by Panorama \u201cwhich showed targeted bullying of vulnerable boys by a small number of staff\u201d.</p> <p>They added: \u201cA larger group of staff must have been aware of unacceptable practice but did not challenge or report this behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>In an earlier Ofsted report on Medway, inspectors said staff and middle managers reported feeling a lack of leadership and having \u201clow, or no confidence in senior managers\u201d.</p> <p>The then chief inspector of prisons, Nick Hardwick, said: \u201cManagerial oversight failed to protect young people from harm. Effective oversight is key to creating a positive culture that prevents poor practice happening and ensuring it is reported when it does.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that senior managers at Medway received performance-related pay awards in April amounting to between 10-25% of their annual salaries, according to seniority.</p> <p>In February, G4S announced their intention to sell off their UK children\u2019s services arm of the business, including two secure training centres. In May, the MoJ said the National Offender Management Service would take over the running of Medway. In July, Noms formally took control of the STC.</p> <p>Lela Xhemajli was detained at Medway in 2009, aged 15. She says she was unlawfully restrained numerous times in the 18 months she spent at the STC, including one occasion in which her face was repeatedly slammed into icy ground. Now in employment, having \u201cturned [her] life around\u201d, she says she was angry when she heard about the pay awards to managers.</p> <p>\u201cI assumed the senior management team would be sacked after what was revealed in the investigations. But now it looks like they have been rewarded for allowing children to be abused in prison on their watch,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Former Labour MP Sally Keeble, who has highlighted alleged G4S abuses in children\u2019s secure training centres for more than a decade, said: \u201cThis is people making personal profit out of tragedy, and it is completely unacceptable. Given the government\u2019s expressed concern about the need to protect vulnerable young people, I would hope that justice minister Liz Truss would intervene and make sure these bonuses are not being paid by a Ministry of Justice contractor.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for G4s confirmed that no senior managers at Medway were disciplined or dismissed following the Panorama and Guardian investigations. He said two duty operational managers had been dismissed.</p> <p>The spokesman said: \u201cFour people working at Medway were eligible for performance related pay this year under a mix of personal [non-financial] and financial objectives. One received no payment and the remaining three received reduced payments, based on elements of personal and financial performance.\u201d</p> <p>The MoJ declined to comment, saying the pay awards were a matter for G4S.</p>",

I\u2019m not old enough to remember it myself, but as a parent it touches a raw nerve about how you could ever cope with losing your children in circumstances like that.</p> <p>And some of the reporting, after all this time, still has the capacity to move you.</p> <p>Roy Greenslade has published on his blog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/oct/20/aberfan-a-reporters-letter-home-reveals-the-true-horror-of-the-tragedy\">a letter that Alix Palmer wrote home to her mother from the village</a>, where she had been sent to report for the Daily Express:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I saw such dreadful things, Mummy. They brought out the deputy headmaster, still clutching five children, their bones so hardened that they first had to break his arms to get the children away then their arms to get them apart. And the mothers of two of them watched it happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>The most impressive coverage I\u2019ve seen today is by WalesOnline. They have produced <a href=\"http://aberfan.walesonline.co.uk/\">a beautifully designed special feature on Aberfan</a>, which includes the testimony of several survivors and rescue workers who have never spoken publicly before about their experiences.</p> <p>I truly urge you to spend some time reading through it \u2013 I can\u2019t stop thinking about these words by Melvyn Walker about the impact it had on him as an eight year old who had escaped from one of the classrooms:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I couldn\u2019t go to school for two years.

It is simply too large and too centralised, for example patients shouldn't need to travel to a central hospital for an ultrasound; patients and their families shouldn't need to explain the same symptoms/history at every shift change to all the new staff. While emergency care is amazing the primary care can be completely patchy depending on where you're unlucky to be ill. In many European countries private capacity is incorporated into health services and it works remarkably well without fears of money grabbing or lousy service. The problem with the Tory approach is that privatisation never really works in the UK, because making profits becomes paramount and share ownership promoted as a virtuous ideal - there are scant examples of real value and improvements being delivered by privatisation. So the problem is a psychological British one: why can't we do privatisation to actually improve service? Other countries do.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5809dda3e4b0cd26ff71f73c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/guardian-readers\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T13:42:26.068Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Are baby boxes on the way for Scotland?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another conversation our team of moderators found particularly interesting this week (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/oct/21/baby-boxes-the-nhs-join-our-live-look-at-the-week-to-discuss?page=with:block-5809dccfe4b055209adafd6c#block-5809dccfe4b055209adafd6c\">see 13:35</a>) was around this article on baby boxes in Scotland.

It is scary to suddenly come across part of the British population who must have had a simmering anti-foreign sentiment for a long time. I've lived here longer than I lived in my native country and if someone is asking me now if I wanted to become British to make my life here secure, I think I would have to be nearly desperate to do so as this country is split, with nationalism raising its ugly head. Having read plenty of blogs, I can't but help that many of the people having voted BREXIT have done so because they felt left behind and unheard and are under the impression that they will get back what the lost over the last 40 or so years. What they want back cannot be got back as what they want is for globalisation to go away, as the world is so meshed up now that you can't have control as one has to compromise in this globalised world. If people think that foreign people undercut their own wages, ask if something produced or service rendered more expensive than created or done by people in another country will not be left unbought, making it unproductive so that said UK worker will be out of a job soon, never mind if the competition is working within the UK or in another country.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>What do you think?

  "<p>To use the senseless death of a school shooting victim to promote one\u2019s warped political agenda is, to use a trendy term, deplorable. One should expect nothing less from the odious low-budget film company Pure Flix, whose work includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/17/gods-not-dead-review\">God\u2019s Not Dead</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/01/gods-not-dead-2-review-pure-flix\">God\u2019s Not Dead 2</a> and the forthcoming God\u2019s Not Dead 3. (Yes, God\u2019s Not Dead 2 ended with a Marvel Studios-like stinger.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/03/christsploitation-christian-hollywood-gives-thanks-for-the-new-wave-of-faith-movies\">Christsploitation \u2013\u00a0Hollywood gives thanks for the new wave of faith movies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their latest, I\u2019m Not Ashamed, bends the horrible tragedy of the Columbine massacre into a false narrative of Christian martyrdom. Rachel Scott was killed that horrible day because she didn\u2019t hide her faith from the killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who, it is suggested, could have done great things had they only gone to church and not played video games and read about Darwin.</p> <p>But Before I\u2019m Not Ashamed unleashes its violence it is mostly just a long, winding high school drama. Rachel (Masey McLain) is a typical teen who wishes she stood out in the crowd more. After sneaking out one night with friends to meet with boys and sip beer, she is grounded by her religious mother, and later sent from Colorado to her cousins in Louisiana for the summer. Her inner tumult is calmed by accepting Jesus, visualized by a white light pouring into church windows before leaping off a deck with Adirondack chairs into a lake.</p> <p>But back at school there\u2019s still the usual awkwardness around boys. She likes Alex (Cameron McKendry), her drama club mentor, but she grows quite close to Nate (Ben Davies), a homeless kid she helps get back on his feet with her church group. There are also her friends, experimenting more with alcohol and dating, and who suggest she should tamp down her Jesus freak side if she ever wants to get what she truly wants.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJJ2xphZjjA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RJJ2xphZjjA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I\u2019m Not Ashamed features a lot of voiceover from Rachel\u2019s diaries, in which, as teens are wont to do, she exaggerates her problems. Since her interest is religion, she sees every daily confrontation as some great ethical parable. \u201cI\u2019m drowning in a lake of my own despair,\u201d she writes, worried if Alex sees her as a girlfriend or just a friend. It\u2019s the type of thing that an adult would look back on and be mortified to think others would ever read.</p> <p>Rachel\u2019s spiritual journey eventually leads to aggressive do-gooderism. She\u2019s sickened by school bullying and decides to be everyone\u2019s confidante and support system. She even flirts with the disabled kid. Her positive energy, she hopes, will start a chain reaction. Wouldn\u2019t you know that\u2019s the same phrase used by Harris and Klebold, who similarly loathe the brutish jocks at the school. But instead of gospel they read about Hitler and play violent video games. \u201cIf only this was Columbine,\u201d Klebold muses as he blasts people to digital bits. \u201cMaybe it could be,\u201d Harris responds.</p> <p>To the film\u2019s credit, these moments of absolute atrociousness aren\u2019t too common. And there is a saving grace here with newcomer Masey McLain. She is, undeniably, a terrific, warm and engaging performer. Wearing kooky hats (as Rachel Scott often did) she exudes the excitability of a drama club kid with great intelligence. The public and private Rachel are, at first, quite different, until her eventual decision to be an out-of-the-closet believer. Even with this rancid script and amateurish direction, McLain sells this inherently undramatic turn as an emotional triumph. It\u2019s not enough to actually recommend the film, but it gets you rooting that McLain cracks out of the \u201cfaith-based\u201d ghetto and continues to work. The sky is the limit for her.</p> <p>Whether or not Rachel Scott was specifically targeted during the attack, and if she was asked if she still believed in God before she was shot, is something that people on the internet like to quarrel about. I don\u2019t much recommend looking into it too deeply because no one really knows, websites devoted to Columbine theories are horrible and, frankly, it doesn\u2019t matter. What does matter is exploiting this young woman\u2019s horrible fate to fit a previously constructed phony narrative of oppression. The only way that Pure Flix can continue to sell tickets (and tie-in books) is by whipping its audience to a froth of paranoia. Doing good, as Rachel Scott did, simply isn\u2019t enough. One must be looking over one\u2019s shoulder at all times for the secular humanists plotting to destroy America. It\u2019s probably not a coincidence I\u2019m Not Ashamed comes out just a few weeks before the general election.</p>",

  "<p>It happened three years ago, with an \u00a385 M&amp;S <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/14/marks-and-spencer-coat-kilt\">pink wide-lapel coat</a> \u2013 and now it has happened again. After racking up thousands of views on Zara\u2019s website and being spotted on the likes of <a href=\"https://fashionbombdaily.com/steal-olivia-palermos-london-fashion-week-zara-urban-collection-high-collar-sweater-and-side-band-trousers/\">Olivia Palermo</a>, a pair of \u00a359.99 black wide-legged trousers has become The Item \u2013 a much-desired high street designer knock-off that attracts punters in droves, sells out everywhere, and gives the brand responsible a firm grip on the zeitgeist.<br></p> <p>It works like this: a piece of clothing appears in a high street shop. Resembling something on the catwalk or a trend in the ether, it is usually placed at the entrance by the security gates. Eminently more wearable (and cheaper) than its designer counterpart, and having had a decent run in glossy magazines, it gets snapped up. People see it on their friends, and compelled by a desire to own something they don\u2019t need, want it, compounded by the fact that it is a) now out of stock and b) worn by fashion-cognisant types who can sniff out a cult piece a mile off. And lo, The Item is born.</p> <p>The Zara trousers, with two thick red stripes down the side, have the tics \u2013 stripe width, shape \u2013 of <a href=\"http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2015/10/pfw-chloe-ss16/\">Chloe\u2019s SS16 track pants</a>, without wading into plagiaristic waters. They racked up 1,000 views a week online, and despite arriving in store almost two months ago, according to the eCommerce site <a href=\"https://www.lyst.co.uk/\">Lyst</a>, they are currently the second most-viewed product on the site.</p> <p>It helps, of course, that they are flattering, that an \u201cAmerican socialite\u201d like Palermo who can afford Chloe has bought them, and that Zara is often designed with taller, slimmer people in mind so that their wearers act as ersatz models. And that, thanks to the fact the athleisure market (sporty-looking clothes that would be wholly disastrous worn on the track) has exploded, or even peaked \u2013 there are currently more than eight variations of this sort of pseudo-trackpant at Zara alone \u2013 the market is flooded; there is too much choice. The same is likely to happen with a Mango skirt \u2013 patent with a looped belt \u2013 which has had a 122% increase in page views in the last two weeks and is now mostly sold out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think people can feel disenfranchised from high-end fashion and thus don't feel any guilt about buying 'fakes'</p> <footer> <cite>Katherine Ormerod</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Any feeling that the derivative nature of The Item should limit its success misreads the consumer mood. \u201cI do think that people can feel disenfranchised from high-end fashion and thus don\u2019t feel any guilt about buying \u2018fakes\u2019,\u201d explains Katherine Ormerod, editorial director at Lyst. \u201cThe high street has become increasingly brazen with its rip-offs, fuelled no doubt by the countless loopholes that allow brands peddling near-identical fakes to evade prosecution. For a consumer it is a quandary \u2013 if you would never be able to afford the JW Anderson buckle skirt, why wouldn\u2019t you opt for Mango\u2019s imitation? Especially when it has been reinvented in patent \u2013 the season\u2019s hottest fabric?\u201d </p> <p>While these items aren\u2019t exactly fakes (moreover there is a lag \u2013 the M&amp;S coat came a year after the catwalk versions, and the Zara trousers are last season\u2019s Chloe) the inspiration is palpable. And, in a new twist, Zara keeps restocking the trousers \u2013 so expect to see them even more.</p> <p>People also look to certain brands, Zara included, for direction. Zara, apparently, plants spies on the front row of fashion shows, and can efficiently reproduce an on-trend item in a few weeks. But equally powerful has been the recent wave of designer-high street collaborations, which allows labels to control things. November sees the arrival of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/oct/20/kenzo-x-hm-what-to-buy-from-the-new-collaboration-in-pictures\">Kenzo x H&amp;M collaboration</a> and one item \u2013 a pink shearling and leather jacket \u2013 looks set to be another Item. </p> <p>The M&amp;S pink coat was not the first illustration of the high street cult, but was one of the most effective examples of what can be done with excessive PR hammering, advertising, celebrity endorsements (Daisy Lowe, nothing short of this generation\u2019s everywoman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/oct/14/pink-coat-fashion-buy-ask-hadley\">wore hers a lot</a>) and, to an extent, mirroring of the catwalk. The 2012 shows were heavy with pink coats, from Osman to Jil Sander, and while this coat was not a direct rip-off, it bore the correct hue. This coat became the perfect representation of our confused love of fashion, of wanting to be on trend without having the capital, and wanting to buy into a trend \u2013 a whimsical, impractical one at that \u2013 for under \u00a3100. And when you consider what counts as cult on the catwalk \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/19/dhl-t-shirt-vetements-fashion-paris-catwalk\">Vetements\u2019s DHL T-shirt</a> (ironic) or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/hermes-birkin-handbag-best-investment-returns\">Herm\u00e8s Birkin bag</a> (huge waiting list, four-figure price-tag) \u2013 these are accessible.<br></p> <p>Of course, the moment something is branded as cult it automatically renders it uncool, at least among certain legions. \u201cWe all know they [the trousers] are Zara now \u2013 there\u2019s something so precise about the cut and finish that could entirely pass for designer,\u201d explains Hannah Almassi, editorial director at <a href=\"http://www.whowhatwear.co.uk/\">Who What Wear UK</a>, who doesn\u2019t own a pair, but does get why the world does. \u201cYou can\u2019t place these trousers as high street or high fashion, the side stripe and wide-leg silhouette are inherently flattering, and tap into athleisure without making you feel like a slave to the trend.\u201d </p> <p>Still, no amount of advertising or celebrity endorsement can control a cult: it just happens and, it would seem, arbitrarily. \u201cWhenever I shop in Zara I steer entirely clear of the must-have hot pieces,\u201d explains Ormerod. \u201cYou can see them a mile away \u2026 I\u2019ve been to too many dinners wearing the same outfit as someone sitting next to me.\u201d </p> <p>For every customer who buys into a cult item, there\u2019s a customer who doesn\u2019t want to be part of a cult. The strange thing is: for as long as we want what we can\u2019t have, we\u2019ll still want The Item \u2013 even if, in fact, everyone else has it, too.</p>",
  "<p>A Conservative minister has scuppered the progress of a new law to pardon all gay and bisexual men in England and Wales historically convicted of sexual offences that are no longer criminal.</p> <p>The legislation, put forward by John Nicolson of the SNP, failed to pass to its next stage in the House of Commons after an emotional debate that brought former Labour minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/21/chris-bryant-commons-plea-gay-pardon-law\">Chris Bryant close to tears.</a></p> <p>Nicolson\u2019s bill would have given an automatic pardon to men convicted under the obsolete laws relating to gross indecency with other men.

He argued that the bill did not give strong enough protections against men being accidentally pardoned for sex with a minor or non-consensual sex.</p> <p>An attempt by the SNP to force a vote was unsuccessful because there were not the requisite 100 MPs in the House of Commons. Debate on the bill is set to resume on 16 December but it is unlikely to progress without the support of the government.</p> <p>Ministers announced earlier this week that about 40,000 dead people will be pardoned, three years after a posthumous pardon was issued to the second world war codebreaker Alan Turing for the offence of gross indecency.</p> <p>But out of the 65,000 men convicted under the abolished laws, about 15,000 are still alive and will have to go through an administrative process in order to obtain a pardon.</p> <p>Bryant, the former shadow leader of the House of Commons, fought back tears in parliament as he said it was not good enough for the government to automatically pardon those who are deceased while requiring the living to apply to the Home Office.</p> <p>\u201cWhy on earth would you want to write to the home secretary and say, \u2018Please can I be pardoned\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy on earth would you want to go through a process all over again? Why on earth would you want someone to analyse whether or not you were guilty at all way back when?\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in parliament, Bryant recalled a group of gay and bisexual MPs who opposed the appeasement of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, but were bullied by the government of the day and branded the \u201cglamour boys\u201d. He said they and others should receive \u201csomething that feels like an apology\u201d.</p> <p>Crispin Blunt, the Conservative former justice minister, also warned that the government\u2019s proposals do not have the desired \u201csymbolic effect\u201d, while Nigel Adams, another Tory MP, labelled the behaviour of ministers as \u201ca little bit slippery\u201d.</p> <p>Wes Streeting, a Labour MP, shouted \u201coutrageous\u201d as Gyimah made his arguments and later tweeted that the minister had \u201ccome to work to block a bill to deliver justice for people imprisoned and chemically castrated for being gay \u2013 what a guy\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/lgbt-gay-men-pardon-persecution-law\">Gay men\u2019s lives were ruined by the British state: a pardon is not enough | Jonathan Cooper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nicolson said his bill would \u201cprovide a blanket pardon for any gay man convicted of a crime which is no longer a crime\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe meaning of that is patently obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the crime for which you were convicted is still a crime, by definition you are not pardoned,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let nobody be confused about that.

  "<p>\u201cPfff,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, shrugging his shoulders dismissively.</p> <p>That was how the European commission president replied to a journalist asking about Theresa May\u2019s Brexit comments during her first European council meeting. </p> <p>There was no special event, he added, and he was right. </p> <p>The prime minister was given just five minutes to set out her view on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU at 1am, after a six-hour session in which the European leaders ate pan-fried scallops, crown of lamb with roast figs, and iced vanilla parfait, while discussing the migration crisis and Russian aggression in Syria. </p> <p>Her \u201cclear message\u201d that the UK was leaving the EU but would play a full role until that point was met with silence, before the group moved on to a short final discussion on housekeeping issues about how the summit is organised. </p> <p>Juncker\u2019s spluttered response may have been a momentary reaction to an issue he did not want to address; but more likely it was a deliberate attempt to offer broadcasters an enduring image of Britain being sidelined.</p> <p>And it highlighted how for May the European council, like other events with her counterparts on the continent since the EU referendum, provided a somewhat awkward encounter. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b1e89a8f719250508f43311fdd50da11d7cfd16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b1e89a8f719250508f43311fdd50da11d7cfd16/0_262_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrats in the European parliament\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrats in the European parliament, said the behaviour of the British government was creating a lot of anger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EU summits are an unusual environment for leaders, as they haggle over texts during dinner meetings without back-up from their advisers. </p> <p>But one government source said the Brexit decision had put May in \u201ca very odd position\u201d at the summit, far removed from the experience of her predecessors. \u201cIt is a very different personal experience from the one Cameron or Brown or Blair or Major had \u2026 She is on her way out and we are on our way out.\u201d</p> <p>And that is why, in Brussels, Brits feel increasingly like pariahs in the room.</p> <p>Despite claims from other leaders that the UK would remain a full and involved member of the EU until article 50 is triggered, May\u2019s own irritation at being cut out of a meeting of the other 27 leaders in Bratislava last month was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-uk-centre-of-european-decision-making-until-brexit\">quickly slapped down by European politicians.</a> </p> <p>Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrats in the European parliament, said: \u201cWhen somebody wants to leave a club, it is not normal that such a member wants to decide about the future of this club.

May\u2019s promise that Britain will control immigration while keeping maximum economic access was given short shrift. \u201cThe fundamental freedoms are inseparable,\u201d said Schulz.</p> <p>But the Tory MEP leader, Syed Kamall, hit back, telling journalists in the huge media room of the Justus Lipsius building, headquarters of the European council, that it was just posturing.</p> <p>No 10 sources stressed that May was a central part of discussions about the atrocities in Syria, working closely with her French and German counterparts. </p> <p>Behind closed doors, she did receive a warmer welcome. With Taavi R\u00f5ivas, Estonia\u2019s prime minister, she discussed a strong defence relationship between the two countries. A source at No 10 claimed the leader even stressed that Brexit brought some opportunities.</p> <p>With Klaus Iohannis, the president of Romania, the focus was on cooperation on counter-terrorism. Both he and R\u00f5ivas insisted they wanted a close relationship with the UK, and May said her hope was to guarantee the rights of their citizens already in Britain, if the same could be promised for Britons in their countries.</p> <p>But British officials are advising May to be cautious about what she can negotiate in bilateral meetings, which can be warm, informal and easy to misinterpret.

  "<p>The government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/20/posthumous-pardons-law-may-see-oscar-wilde-exonerated\" title=\"\">has announced</a> it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/posthumous-pardons-for-gay-and-bisexual-men-share-your-views\" title=\"\">pardon men</a> convicted of having sex with other men. These men were convicted of crimes that couldn\u2019t apply to men and women having sex with one another or women having sex together. They were crimes that only consenting adult men could commit. It\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/apology-posthumous-pardons-for-gay-men\" title=\"\">welcome development</a> \u2013 even men who have died will receive a pardon; but does pardoning those men unlucky enough to get caught actually address the trauma to which the British state subjected LGBT people?</p> <p>For centuries, LGBT people have been hounded in this country, but in the 20th century the full force of the state was used against homosexual men. Lesbians weren\u2019t the victims of the criminal law, but they fared little better. The concept of a trans identity was simply rejected.</p> <p>We were all despised.</p> <p>I grew up in rural Devon in the 1970s, a gay kid at a local comprehensive. This was England, and even though homosexuality had been partially decriminalised the decade before, England remained a very hostile place to be gay. Homophobia was the norm. It was so normal, there wasn\u2019t a word for it then.</p> <p>In myself, I didn\u2019t mind who I was, but I knew others did and that I couldn\u2019t be known to be gay. There would be too many consequences. There was always the risk of violence, physical or verbal. They called me \u201cpoof\u201d. How could they tell? I lived in genuine fear of being found out. My sexuality had to be stifled.</p> <p>Of course, as I entered my late teens random sexual fumbling occurred; casual encounters with strangers. I told no one. On one level I was ashamed, but I adapted. I grew to relish the taboo. I had no idea that I was committing criminal offences. Homosexuality may have been partially decriminalised in 1967, but only if you were over 21 and the sex took place in private. I was under 21, and was not protected by the law. I still remember a few years later meeting a 19-year-old who\u2019d been convicted of gross indecency. At least he can be pardoned now.</p> <p>And then along came Aids. I went into a genuine state of anxiety. I could tell no one about it. Like so many young gay men of my generation, my future was shadowed by the spectre of Aids.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/20/posthumous-pardons-law-may-see-oscar-wilde-exonerated\">Posthumous pardons law may see Oscar Wilde exonerated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story that I have just told will resonate with gay and lesbian people who are now 40-plus. From a tender age we learned to cope, to avoid, to control. Can bullying be managed? With so little experience of life, how do you avoid violence and the fear of it? How do you deal with rejection? And as for yearning, how is that suppressed?</p> <p>In the years that followed 1967 the number of convictions for gross indecency, an offence that could only be committed by consenting gay men, doubled. Prosecutions peaked in the 1980s. Between 1967 and 2003, when the gross indecency law was finally consigned to history, it is believed that there were up to 35,000 convictions, although actual figures are unclear.</p> <p>There was also something remarkably naive about the 1967 act. It didn\u2019t address the reality of most gay men, for whom finding a private space was a near impossibility. How could they bring sexual partners home to their parents or wives?</p> <p>So is the abuse of the LGBT community an unfortunate accident of history? Like apartheid, criminalising gay men distorted everything and its poison permeated every aspect of life. Who was not complicit in the torment of the LGBT community? By pursuing gay men, did the UK end up with a sexual offences regime that was not fit for purpose and that could be easily manipulated by others, which in turn left the most vulnerable exposed?</p> <p>And what about Aids? Did the pre-existing and ongoing persecution of gay men exacerbate the crisis? To what extent were safe sex messages for gay men hampered because in the early years of the Aids crisis there was no experience of dealing with this widely criminalised underclass?</p> <p>We all lost too many to Aids. None of us were equipped or prepared. Our anger and sadness will always live with us. But was our loss intensified by those who should have protected us? Why in the midst of the Aids crisis, for example, did the government introduce legislation banning the so-called promotion of homosexuality? At a time when we most needed the pastoral care of the state, it turned on us and magnified our pain.</p> <p>My story is just one of many. We now live in a world that is unrecognisable to that in which I came of age. But should we feel resentment and anger that our generation and the countless generations before us were subjected to treatment that, if meted out to others, would be described as persecution?</p> <p>British government policy relating to LGBT people destroyed lives. We may still be living with the mental health consequences of those policies, and if you take just one issue, LGBT suicide, its full extent has never been acknowledged. We also know there is extensive alcohol and drug addiction within the LGBT community. We are entitled to question why this is, and we deserve answers.</p> <p>Pardoning those who were convicted for seeking intimacy is a decent gesture, but it is only a gesture and gives no answers, explanations or real remedies. Nor does it capture the experience of every single one of us. The state made us outsiders, and for many this included being an outsider from their families \u2013 those they loved the most. The human spirit is indomitable, and the LGBT spirit is no less so. We survived, but that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t entitled to the truth, to have our stories heard and to a fully reasoned explanation and apology for our persecution. We need more than pardons for those convicted. What\u2019s needed is an independent investigation in to how the British state could have treated us as it did.</p>",
  "<p>India\u2019s cricketing brains trust will not have summoned an emergency meeting to redraft their plans for the five-Test series against England after studying the second day\u2019s play here. They will be content to stick with plan A, which is, as usual, to spin for victory.</p> <p>The pitch at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium, while slow, is still offering turn but, with the exception of a brilliant first over from Moeen Ali just before lunch during which he removed Imrul Kayes and Mominul Haque, England\u2019s triumvirate of spinners found it tough going in the cauldron of Chittagong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/21/england-gareth-batty-test-wicket-bangladesh-cricket\">England\u2019s Gareth Batty relishes first Test wicket in 11 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ball continued to spin throughout the day but as it increasingly looked as if it had been ripped from the teeth of a stubborn, ill-trained golden retriever, it did so with less venom. Moreover, the inability of the England spinners to becalm the Bangladesh batsmen became ever more apparent. Often a succession of maidens can lead to mistakes by the batting side in these conditions but no such pressure could be applied.</p> <p>In part this was down to the excellence of the batsmen. Tamim Iqbal led the way with a high quality 78 from 179 balls, which may not suggest he was motoring along but on this pitch and with a sluggish outfield it probably translates to a rate of over four runs per over at Lord\u2019s.</p> <p>Then the other experienced men in the Bangladesh middle order \u2013 Mahmudullah, the wonderfully impish Mushfiqur Rahman, and the old pragmatist, Shakib Al Hasan \u2013 sustained the torment into the final session. The home side were 221 for five at the close in what is proving to be a compelling game \u2013 mainly because there is sufficient encouragement for the bowlers, spin bowlers that is.</p> <p>None of the English spinners could match the control of the 18-year-old debutant, Mehedi Hasan. He snatched one more victim in the morning, while the left-armer Taijul Islam took two wickets as England added 35 more runs. Chris Woakes was caught at short leg from the first ball of the day, Adil Rashid contributed a skittish 26 while Stuart Broad was caught behind off Mehedi after yet another review.</p> <p>The 10 reviews in the England innings was a world record. Perhaps the third umpire, Sundaram Ravi, should put in for a pay rise. Out in the middle, poor Kumar Dharmasena had yet another of his lbw decisions overturned and will probably not choose this week to knock on the ICC\u2019s doors in search of an increased salary. After two days he has raised his finger six times and only once has a batsman been required to head off to the pavilion.</p> <p>Bangladesh\u2019s response to England\u2019s total of 293 was sedate and secure. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/21/england-gareth-batty-test-wicket-bangladesh-cricket\">Gareth Batty shared the new ball</a> with Stuart Broad. His first delivery for England in 11 years was short and cut for four by Imrul Kayes but when he found a better length he sometimes beat the bat with sharp turn. After six overs he gave way to Moeen, whose second delivery fizzed off the pitch to clip the top of Kayes\u2019s off stump. Three balls later Haque, another left-hander, edged the ball into Jonny Bairstow\u2019s hip; the ricochet ballooned up to Ben Stokes in the gully.</p> <p>But England could not capitalise after lunch. Rashid spun the ball sharply but too often the pressure was relieved by loose deliveries and the subsequent cheap runs. International batsmen do not dread the unplayable ball anywhere near as much as being unable to score. Even Moeen, after his dream start, allowed the batsmen too much leeway.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/21/india-to-use-decision-review-system-for-first-time-in-upcoming-test-series-against-england-cricket\">India to use DRS for first time in upcoming Test series against England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tamim\u2019s judgment of length was impeccable; he favoured punching the ball off the back foot through the covers, which he did with surprising power. He has a magnificent record against England \u2013 an average of 65. Even so the constant presence of a long-off when the off-spinners were bowling to him seemed a precaution too far on a pitch such as this. Surely he should have been required to earn the right to tap the ball down to long-off for a single?</p> <p>Mahmudullah offered disciplined support until the last over before tea when he pushed forward to a Rashid leg-break and was neatly caught at slip by Joe Root. After tea Tamim, loitering on the back foot once too often, became Batty\u2019s first Test wicket for 11 years when he was neatly caught by Bairstow. At last Batty could permit himself a characteristic roar \u2013 he always attracts the adjective \u201cfeisty\u201d but until this point the 39-year-old had been going about his business as decorously as a choirboy.</p> <p>Shakib bristled from the start in a stand of 58 with Mushfiqur, who was caught \u2013 not so neatly this time \u2013 by Bairstow just before the close, thus becoming the first batsman to succumb to a seam bowler (Stokes) in the match.</p> <p>It is, of course, the spin department that causes more anxiety for England. These are early days on the expedition but the spin trio failed to convince. Briefly Moeen with his extra pace through the air was threatening but he could not consolidate.</p> <p>Rashid was exasperating \u2013 on turning pitches so many free runs can make him a liability.

But the priest is a drunk and a thief who tries robbing his savior; the hero is actually a killer, though not, he insists while taking the priest\u2019s bullets and water, a thief. Cue the credit sequence, a full-blown homage to the spaghetti western, A Fistful of Dollars. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/13/in-a-valley-of-violence-review-ethan-hawke-tongue-in-cheek-western\">In a Valley of Violence review: Hawke underplays in tongue-in-cheek western</a> </p> </aside>  <p> In the Valley of Violence, directed by Ti West, packs a lot into its opening moments. It also speaks to the state of westerns today. Despite occasional rumors of its demise \u2013 and two decades where memorable entries were the exception \u2013 the western is now surprisingly vibrant, thanks to a flexibility that allows movies and TV series to celebrate the genre\u2019s traditions, deconstruct its conventions or do both. </p> <p> \u201cThe western has always been the American epic,\u201d says Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University\u2019s Bleier Center for Television &amp; Popular Culture. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting and violent and huge. We don\u2019t have a single text like The Iliad or The Odyssey but the western is our story.\u201d</p> <p> Westerns never died off but few were made from 1980 to 2003. They returned with a vengeance after 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq. \u201cIt was a time that sent people into shock and America was longing for a way to figure out what went wrong, who we are, what are values are and where we go in future,\u201d says Richard Aquila, author of Wanted Dead or Alive: The American West in Popular Culture.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1wF1SS4rpg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w1wF1SS4rpg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> \u201cThe story and the archetypes in westerns may be simple, but that allows you to use subtext to tie things in to what is happening now,\u201d says West, whose previous credits were mainly within the horror genre.

John McClane\u2019s \u201cYippee Ki Yay, motherfucker\u201d is that generation\u2019s most memorable cowboy quote. For two decades, westerns were slick Hollywood confections like Young Guns, Tombstone, Maverick and Wyatt Earp or comedies like Three Amigos and City Slickers that satirized overly familiar tropes. There was one glorious span from 1989 to 1992 with four stirring exceptions: the Lonesome Dove miniseries in 1989, followed by the smash hit Dances With Wolves, Thunderheart and Clint Eastwood\u2019s final word on the topic in his classic Unforgiven.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c39a4e8699870209a8c778da75ce87f48a8777b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c39a4e8699870209a8c778da75ce87f48a8777b5/0_83_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of Deadwood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of Deadwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Deadwood paved the way for the new westerns, Thompson says.

The ending of the scintillating remake of 3:10 to Yuma was deadlier than the original, The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford was a mournful study of a society obsessed with myth and celebrity, and There Will Be Blood was about greed, oil and violence (or the Republican party under Dick Cheney).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/15/craig-zahler-on-bone-tomahawk\">Best western: why Bone Tomahawk became a gunslinging cult hit</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The Coen brothers\u2019 riveting No Country for Old Men was \u201ca morality play with an ending that shows good doesn\u2019t necessarily triumph over evil,\u201d Aquila says, a good fit for a country frightened of terrorists and bogged down in a misguided war. The Coens returned to the western under a new president three years later with a more hopeful film, their True Grit remake. \u201cThat shows how we use the western myths,\u201d he says, adding that the next great western of the Obama era was Django Unchained, which showed a black man as the gunslinger hero. (This year\u2019s box office success of The Revenant and The Magnificent Seven reveals a desire \u201cfor a more traditional American spirit\u201d and a tough-guy hero, he says, although our presidential candidates confound every reasonable archetype).</p> <p> Meanwhile, television produced Justified, Longmire and Hell on Wheels. But the western\u2019s new life derives not just from quintessential American visionaries like Quentin Tarantino and Tommy Lee Jones (2014\u2019s The Homesman) but from foreign-born film-makers from Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu to Kristian Levring (2014\u2019s The Salvation), John Maclean (Slow West) and David Mackenzie (Hell or High Water).</p> <p> \u201cWe don\u2019t get bogged down in what small-town America was like and we can have a slight cynicism and criticism about America and the genre,\u201d says Maclean, whose timely tale is about the rude awakening awaiting a naive immigrant on his journey into the new world. Maclean\u2019s film is lit with a glow, like a fable \u201cto comment on storytelling and the myths of the west\u201d, which he directly punctures with sly humor. </p> <p> The freshest takes these days find new ways to subvert, escape or toy with the familiar cliches. Westworld is so aware that it is about an artificial landscape its customers know so well that guests choose between white or black hats before venturing into the playground of the wild west. \u201cThey are picking up on our traditional notions of the western but then playing with them,\u201d Aquila says, while remaining timely by exploring our anxiety about topics like artificial intelligence.</p> <p> \u201cThis is still our historical epic,\u201d Thompson adds. \u201cThe western is going to be around for a long time.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I arrived in the UK when I was just 13 years old and was completely alone. </p> <p>I spent a year travelling through 10 countries, was sent to jail, had my face burnt with chemicals and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/18/70-of-migrants-to-europe-from-north-africa-trafficked-or-exploited-un-united-nations-survey\">almost died in the Mediterranean</a>. </p> <p>Three weeks after all this was finally over, I found myself in front of five strangers who were tasked with assessing my age.

My father had been killed by US forces, so the Taliban tried to recruit me and my older brother to fight in their \u201choly war\u201d. I was only about 10 or 11, but the option they gave us was fight or die. The government, meanwhile, wanted us to be informants.<br></p> <p>Instead, my mother took the decision to send us away. She saved me but she also lost me, because 10 years later I am not the same Gulwali she knew. We said goodbye in Peshawar, Pakistan, and she handed me and my brother over to traffickers, telling us to stay together and keep hold of each other\u2019s hands.<br></p> <p>Almost immediately the agents separated us. I did not see my brother again for 14 months. We travelled on every form of transport; walking through the night, often hungry and thirsty, sometimes sleeping in bunkers or chicken coops. The traffickers didn\u2019t treat us like humans; we were just commodities. The worst point was crossing the Mediterranean from Turkey to Greece. I had never seen the sea before, but I was on a boat built for 20 people loaded with 120 people. We were on it for 50 hours with no food and water, and by the time we were rescued it was sinking.<br></p> <p>The journey was like snakes and ladders. I was arrested and sent to jail in Bulgaria before being sent back to Turkey. In Iran I had to run away from a police prison. What kept me going was faith and the hope of finding my brother. I came to England because I had heard that was where he was heading. It took me more than 100 attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/travel-chaos-warning-as-french-farmers-and-truckers-plan-calais-camp-protest\">get on a lorry in Calais</a>.

We survived because the refrigerator wasn\u2019t turned on. I finally got to the UK. After being arrested and sent to an immigration centre I had my age assessment. They asked me questions about my family background, my journey \u2013 even silly questions about the province I came from in Afghanistan. After three or four hours they announced I was not 13 but 16-and-a-half.<br></p> <p>They said I couldn\u2019t have travelled so far when I was still so young, and that I was too smart to be 13. I know I looked older than I was \u2013 I still do, but I grew up in a harsh, mountain environment and had been through a long, hard journey. They tried to give me a new date of birth. I was so angry. I felt they were worse than the smugglers \u2013 they had been heartless, but they hadn\u2019t tried to change my identity. I was so angry I ripped up the paper the assessors gave me, in front of them.<br></p> <p>In fact they refused to believe I was even from Afghanistan, although they never told me where else they thought my home was. It was stressful and distressing: I didn\u2019t know why they were saying all this. Now I know it is because the Home Office have to put you in school and in foster care and give you the <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/pdf/refugee_children_guidelines_on_protection_and_care.pdf\">legal rights of a child</a> if you are under 16.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/refugees-teeth-britain-children-calais-europe\">As a nation would we ever sink so low as to check refugees\u2019 teeth? | Hugh Muir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead they put me in a independent living centre with adult asylum seekers and told me when I was in 18 (which, according to them, was in a year and a half) I would be deported back to Afghanistan. After that, I felt broken inside. I felt hopeless that I had come all this way, through so much hardship, and now people were saying I was a liar; it was so bad that I tried to kill myself twice in the months that followed. Last year they sent 4,000 former unaccompanied minors back, even though there is fighting in 30 out of 34 provinces in Afghanistan. <br></p> <p>Finally, by chance, I found my brother. He was visiting London and met some people from my centre, who told him they knew someone who looked just like him. I moved up to Bolton to be with him as soon as I could. There I found an education centre for migrant children called <a href=\"http://www.bolton.gov.uk/website/pages/SupportforfamiliesnewtotheUK.aspx\">Starting Point</a>. The headteacher there said a few small words that changed my life. She said she believed me. It meant everything.<br></p> <p>The teachers at the school fought on my behalf, and I also took matters into my own hands. I went to the Afghan embassy and got a birth certificate and a passport; I went to a specialist doctor to confirm my age. Eventually because I also had my Home Office card with my real name on it, the Home Office had to accept I was telling the truth.<br></p> <p>From then on I was put into foster care and allowed to go to school. I got 10 GCSEs and five A levels, and I have just graduated with a degree from Manchester University. Along the way I have written a book, spoken at the UN and carried the Olympic torch. All of those things happened because I was able to get the support and help I needed.<br></p> <p>But it is also why it hurts so much when I read the news reports claiming the young people being brought over from Calais under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/14/child-refugees-in-limbo-in-calais-because-of-home-office-delays\">the Dubs amendment</a> are lying. Why do we have this attitude of suspicion towards refugees? These young people have been through trauma and hardship. They are humans. They don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this. Media reports like this just create hatred against refugees and politicians should be ashamed for jumping on the bandwagon.<br></p> <p>When I go into schools now I often see 16-year-olds who, to me, look 14, because people from different parts of the world look different. People in the UK are brought up in peace and security, with no responsibility, but these young people may have seen their homes burnt and their families killed.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/oct/21/refugee-children-uk-bureaucracy-social-work\">Refugee children arriving in the UK need support \u2013 not bureaucracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If these young people are older than they say, even then they should not be shamed like this, with their <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/child-refugee-front-pages-see-british-media-taken-to-task-by-twitter-users_uk_5805f0cce4b0dcd0298fb183\">pictures splashed across newspapers</a>.

After 10 years I think the world has not got better; things are worse. It\u2019s so hard to see the lack of compassion, the lack of action.

Some were innocents easily bamboozled by his cunning plans.<br></p> <p>What is so baffling is that in the course of the 20-plus years he worked for three News International titles - News of the World, Sunday Times and Sun on Sunday - the editors and managers failed to appreciate that fact.</p> <p>Did they not have pause for thought when a jury asked to convict the Earl of Hardwicke on a drugs charge in 1999 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/23/linusgregoriadis\">sent a note to the judge</a> saying they wouldn\u2019t have convicted him had they been allowed to take Mahmood\u2019s extreme provocation into account?</p> <p>Were their suspicions not aroused by high-profile courtroom reverses? There was the collapse of one involving five men accused of plotting to kidnap Victoria Beckham in 2002. One of the men later successfully sued the paper for libel. Did that not give News International pause for thought?</p> <p>Another case involved three men prosecuted in 2006 for buying a non-existent substance, \u201cred mercury\u201d, in order to build a non-existent \u201cdirty bomb\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/26/newsoftheworld.pressandpublishing\">They were cleared.</a></p> <p>In both cases, there were complaints from lawyers about Mahmood\u2019s investigative methodology, which included the use of agents provocateur.</p> <p>But these cases came relatively late in Mahmood\u2019s employment by News International. What is truly extraordinary is that he worked for the company at all after his first spell as a Sunday Times reporter in the late 1980s, when he left under a cloud after tampering with the main-frame computer in order to cover up a mistake.</p> <p>It amazed Sunday Times executives that, after such an act of dishonesty, he was able to return to the Wapping complex after just a couple of years to take up a job with the News of the World.</p> <p>In his new post, he quickly set about creating a special position for himself, working outside of the normal chain of command. A succession of editors turned a blind eye to his unorthodox methods because he provided the paper with a string of scoops.</p> <p>He was allowed to build his own team of helpers and to spend lavishly in order to invent scenarios that helped him to entrap people. He was able to fly people across the world, book luxury hotels, ply people with champagne and create fake websites.</p> <p>To do so, he drew on the vast resources of one of the world\u2019s major media companies, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. When judges and lawyers complained about his activities, that company defended him at every turn.</p> <p>It spared no funds in providing him with his legal defence following the collapse of the Tulisa Contostavlos case and his prosecution for conspiring to pervert the cause of justice. It also kept him on full pay when he was remanded before trial.</p> <p>But News Corp has not not been Mahmood\u2019s only defender. The Metropolitan police have a lot to answer for down the years.</p> <p>They have often worked hand in glove with Mahmood, especially over the Beckham kidnap and red mercury cases. When one of Mahmood\u2019s \u201cassistants\u201d, Florim Gashi, decided to tell the truth about Mahmood\u2019s methods, police officers flew to Croatia to interview him.</p> <p>It appeared that, at last, Scotland Yard was taking complaints about Mahmood seriously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/17/newsoftheworld.pressandpublishing\">as the Guardian reported in 2005</a>. That investigation came to nothing because officers decided there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/met-police-accused-of-ignoring-warnings-on-fake-sheikh\">insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations.</a></p> <p>Even so, it should have been a warning that there was something nasty in the News of the World woodshed. Instead, as with the phone-hacking scandal, the link between News International and Scotland Yard remained tight.</p> <p>Note also how Mahmood\u2019s relationship with his employers survived the closure of the News of the World after the hacking scandal broke in 2011.</p> <p>By that time he had broken the story of the Pakistani cricketers involved in so-called \u201cspot fixing\u201d during matches. It was regarded as his greatest public interest story.</p> <p>Although the overwhelming majority of the paper\u2019s staff were fired, Mahmood was retained and placed back on the Sunday Times, to the intense irritation of several staff members who knew the circumstances of his 1988 departure.</p> <p>It was only a brief return. Once Murdoch launched the Sun on Sunday, Mahmood was transferred to that title and it was there he delivered the Contostavlos story that was to prove his downfall.<br></p> <p>When he was convicted, a News UK spokesperson said the company was \u201cdisappointed by the news\u201d. You bet it was. Disappointed to have been found out, yet again, as employing a law-breaking journalist. </p>",
  "<p>Unanimous votes are rare in parliament. The House of Commons interfering in the Queen\u2019s honours system, perhaps rarer still. Yet, yesterday, parliament voted unanimously to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/philip-green-labelled-billionaire-spiv-in-commons-debate-on-knighthood\">strip Philip Green of his knighthood</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/kicking-bhs-philip-green-absurb-heres-who-mps-should-castigate\">Kicking Philip Green is absurd. Here\u2019s who MPs should be castigating | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no doubt that he deserves it. During his time at BHS, Sir Philip Green treated the company as his own personal plaything. Instead of investing in its branches and developing its brand, he ran down the pension scheme and used the company to line his own pockets. Then, when years of woeful \u2013 some would say wilful \u2013 mismanagement made itself felt, he jumped ship like the proverbial rat from a sinking ship.</p> <p>It would be laughable for him to retain his honour for \u201cservices to retail\u201d in the face of such conduct. But while the revocation of a knighthood might make headlines, we shouldn\u2019t let it distract us from the real issues.</p> <p>Stripping Green of his knighthood won\u2019t create jobs for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-is-sad-and-very-very-sorry-to-bhs-workers-video\">11,000 who lost them</a>, or fill the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/philip-green-unlikely-to-be-compelled-over-bhs-pension-deficit-says-expert\">\u00a3571m deficit in the pension fund</a>. Nor will it fill the hole left on high streets up and down the country, pay back the \u00a36m owed to HMRC, or ensure that firms in BHS\u2019s supply chain \u2013 many of them small businesses, the foundation stones of our economy \u2013 are paid what they are owed.</p> <p>If yesterday\u2019s vote achieves anything, it will be to put pressure on Green to pay back the pension deficit in full, from his own ample wealth. It would make for a reassuring ending. There may be the occasional person who acts irresponsibly, but rest assured, when that happens, your democratic representatives can be relied upon to roundly condemn them and right the situation. Surely that means the system works?</p> <p>But yesterday\u2019s vote was purely symbolic, an act of tokenism. If Green does make good his promise to replenish the pension fund, it will be due to popular pressure, not the power of the law. This is the most extraordinary thing about the whole affair \u2013 legally, Green has done nothing wrong. We are not talking about a criminal caught with his hands in the till. As repugnant as it seems, he was acting within the letter of the law.</p> <p>This matters because it points to a broader problem. The Tories will have us believe that the BHS scandal arose from the moral failings of one man. But it is the system that is bent. The destruction of the pension scheme is not unique to BHS. Just weeks ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/bernard-matthews-pensioners-regulation-shareholders\">Bernard Matthews went into administration</a>, and it was pensioners, including in my own constituency of Norwich South, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/bernard-matthews-pension-pot-to-receive-just-1p-in-the-pound\">who paid the price</a>.</p> <p>And let\u2019s not forget the questionable role played by the auditors who signed off on BHS as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d just a year before it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/sir-philip-green-sells-off-lossmaking-bhs\">sold off for \u00a31</a>. Or the huge City financial advisers who waved through the sale of BHS to Dominic Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions then went on to receive millions in salaries and management fees from the company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/napoleon-or-billionaire-spiv-mps-line-up-to-take-a-shot-at-philip-green\">Napoleon or billionaire spiv? MPs line up to take a shot at Philip Green</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Good businesses are the lifeblood of the economy. But, as responsible business people up and down the country know, the system too often allows good businesses to be undercut by bad. Green is the product of decades of deregulation and market deference, which have encouraged the use of companies to extract wealth rather than create it.</p> <p>Over recent weeks, we have heard the government claiming to have thrown out the laissez-faire fanaticism that has dominated Conservative thinking for 30 years. We have faced the incongruous sight of a Conservative prime minister deploying the language of fairness, democracy and workers\u2019 voices while talking about the economy.</p> <p>But are we really to believe that the party of billionaires and tax avoiders is now the champion of the working class, ready to transform our economy in the interests of fairness? If there is any truth at all to this rhetoric, the government would offer more than gestures. They would tighten up the law on pensions and takeovers to make the fate of BHS a thing of the past. They would take on a corporate culture in which short-term greed prevails over long-term investment. And they would require companies to attend to all stakeholders, rather than just a narrow group of shareholders.</p> <p>They would make sure the system rewards the wealth creators.</p> <p>But for the last six years, the Tories have implemented the harshest attack on living standards in a generation, while dishing out corporate welfare and turning a blind eye to conduct that is easily equal to Green\u2019s. To call them the party of the working class is fanciful.</p> <p>I hope yesterday\u2019s vote will help to hold Green to account. I hope even more that it serves as a wake-up call to start addressing the deeper problems with how our economy is governed. Let\u2019s see if the prime minister takes this opportunity to show that her conversion to Labour\u2019s values is more than just rhetorical.</p>",
  "<p>I was 29 and mowing the lawn at my mother\u2019s house in Birmingham, Alabama, on a hot day in&#xa0;July 1985 when I looked up and saw two police officers. When my mom saw the handcuffs, she screamed. They asked me whether I&#xa0;owned a firearm, and I said no. They asked if my mother owned one, and I said yes. I asked the detective 50 times why I&#xa0;was being arrested. Eventually, he told me I&#xa0;was being arrested for a robbery. I&#xa0;told him, \u201cYou have the wrong man.\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t care whether you did it or not. You will be convicted.\u201d</p> <p>At the station, it became clear I\u2019d&#xa0;been at work when the robbery occurred. The detective verified this with my supervisor, but then told me&#xa0;they were going to charge me with two counts of first-degree murder from two other robberies. They said my mother\u2019s gun was the same kind as the one used at the crime scene, and that I matched the description of the man they were looking for. That was enough for them to pursue charges.</p> <p>When I met my appointed lawyer, I&#xa0;told him I was innocent. He said, \u201cAll of y\u2019all always say you didn\u2019t do&#xa0;something.\u201d I might have seen him three times in the two years I&#xa0;waited for trial. The only evidence linking me to the crime was the testimony of a ballistics expert who&#xa0;said the bullets from the murder weapon could be a match to&#xa0;my mother\u2019s gun. They found me&#xa0;guilty and on 17 December 1986 I&#xa0;went to death row.</p> <p>On death row, the day starts at 2.45am. At 10am they bring lunch. Dinner was at 2pm. And that was it. They don\u2019t care about actual mealtimes: they say they have to get&#xa0;through everyone, so they start early. The cell was 5ft x 7ft. You spend about 24 hours in there.</p> <p>For three years I didn\u2019t say a word to another human. I had to watch 54&#xa0;men walk past to be executed. My&#xa0;cell was 30ft from the chamber and I could smell the burning flesh. There were 22 who took their own life. Going into my fourth year, I&#xa0;heard the man in the cell next to me crying. He told me his mother had died. I said, \u201cWell, now you have someone in heaven to argue your case.\u201d The next morning, it was as though a light had come on: my sense of humour was back.</p> <p>I let my mind travel. I&#xa0;visited the Queen; I married Halle Berry. My mind went everywhere, and at night I\u2019d come back and check on my body.</p> <p>Without lawyer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/01/bryan-stevenson-americas-mandela\">Bryan Stevenson</a> and the <a href=\"http://eji.org/\">Equal Justice Initiative</a> (EJI), I&#xa0;wouldn\u2019t be where I am now. I wrote to him after seeing him on TV one day while being walked back to my cell. I&#xa0;got to meet him in 1995 and finally had someone to fight for me.</p> <p>He hired a ballistics expert and when we got the news that the bullets didn\u2019t match, we went to the attorney general. They refused to take an hour to re-examine the case because it would be a \u201cwaste of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d, and I sat on death row for another 16 years.</p> <p>EJI kept pushing for a retrial and eventually, on 3 April 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/03/alabama-man-death-row-freed-anthony-ray-hinton\">the State&#xa0;of Alabama dropped all charges</a>. I was released that same day. I&#xa0;couldn\u2019t take it in: when you\u2019ve been locked up for nearly 30&#xa0;years, nothing is the same. It was like walking out on to another planet at the age of 58. Someone had to introduce me to the internet.

And in your evidence, in your letter and in your speech you are getting into political partisanship, removing yourself from your Olympian detachment, damaging the Bank\u2019s ability to regulate through influence, which has historically been just as important as the letter of the law.</p> </blockquote> <p>On 13 June, Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, wrote to Carney telling him to stay out of the referendum debate just as he would a general election.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You are prohibited from making any public comment, or doing anything which could be construed as taking part in the referendum debate.

You were the intended beneficiary.</p> <p>\u201cThe motive was to protect and enhance your reputation. You wanted another scalp and Tulisa Contostavlos\u2019s conviction would have allowed that, and to achieve that, when you saw a problem, you were prepared for the court to be deceived.\u201d<br></p> <p>Mahmood\u2019s lawyer John Kelsey-Fry QC told the judge: \u201cHe stands before you a very frightened man.\u201d</p> <p>Kelsey-Fry added that over the years Mahmood had been responsible for sending many individuals to prison and had worked with police. \u201cMr Mahmood is not expected to be the most welcome, nor the most popular, inmate,\u201d he said, adding prison would be \u201cmuch harder\u201d because of that.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe has brought a catastrophe upon himself,\u201d said Kelsey-Fry. \u201cA lifetime\u2019s work will be forever tarnished.\u201d</p> <p>Some saw him \u201cmerely as an entertainment journalist targeting celebrities\u201d, but Mahmood had \u201coften placed himself in personal danger in pursuing professional criminals\u201d and had \u201craised awareness in areas of genuine public concern\u201d, said Kelsey-Fry.</p> <p>He had received awards and recognition. \u201cSo whatever people may say of him today that career has provided some valued service.\u201d</p> <p>The judge said he took into account Mahmood\u2019s previous good character, \u201cand accepted that in the course of your career you have done some good work in the past\u201d.</p> <p>Mahmood was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 costs.</p> <p>Referring to Smith, the judge said Mahmood had \u201cmade use of a loyal person, partly an employee, in order to achieve your purpose\u201d.</p> <p>As the two stood in the dock, he told them: \u201cYou have been convicted by the jury of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. You, Alan Smith, agreed to and did alter your original witness statement to remove the passage that you both realised could be used to support Tulisa Contostavlos\u2019s case in an entrapment hearing.\u201d</p> <p>Trevor Burke QC, acting for Smith, argued for a suspended sentence saying the driver had numerous health problems and was to undergo knee and hip replacement surgery soon. </p> <p> Gordon also acknowledged a letter from the editor of the Sun on Sunday and one from Mahmood\u2019s mother\u2019s GP. The sentence would affect Mahmood\u2019s mother, who was \u201celderly and infirm\u201d, the judge heard. Mahmood was divorced, and had joint custody of his 14-year-old son. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2016/oct/21/tulisa-contostavlos-reflects-mazher-mahmood-jailing-bbc-documentary-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58gya\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2826910\"            data-video-name=\"Tulisa Contostavlos reflects on Mazher Mahmood jailing in BBC documentary \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC - Tulisa: The Price of Fame\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580a3940e4b005f21833bdd1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/21/161021tulisa_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/21/161021tulisa.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/21/161021tulisa_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2016/oct/21/tulisa-contostavlos-reflects-mazher-mahmood-jailing-bbc-documentary-video\">Tulisa Contostavlos reacts to Mazher Mahmood jailing in BBC documentary</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In an interview to be shown on Sunday on BBC1, Contostavlos said Mahmood was now serving the prison sentence she could have faced.</p> <p>\u201cIf you were to go back in time and someone was to say to me three years ago: \u2018OK, Mazher Mahmood is going to be facing the same amount of time in jail as you were, he\u2019s going to be the one in the firing line and the press are going to put him on the front pages and destroy his reputation as they did to you,\u2019 it\u2019s bizarre.

But they must not be held to ransom by a corrupt or unscrupulous press. So please let\u2019s cleanse this stain on our democracy once and for all.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign group Hacked Off said the need for the second part of the Leveson inquiry was \u201coverwhelmingly clear\u201d. Part two, expected to investigate law-breaking and improper conduct within media organisations, was put on hold until criminal proceedings end. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: \u201cCriminal investigations relating to the Leveson inquiry have not yet been completed and we have always been clear that the conclusion of these cases must take place before we can consider part two of the inquiry.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s public finances suffered a shock setback in September after a collapse in corporation tax receipts widened the budget deficit to \u00a310.6bn.</p> <p>A slowdown in the growth of VAT receipts was also blamed for pushing the deficit \u00a31.3bn, or 14.5%, higher than September last year and higher than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/government-borrowing-higher-than-expected-at-105bn-figures-show-brexit\">the \u00a310.5bn recorded in August</a>.<br></p> <p>City analysts, who had expected an \u00a38.5bn shortfall, warned that the figures were a setback for Philip Hammond as he prepares to boost public spending in his autumn statement next month. The chancellor is seeking ways to boost growth next year to cushion the economy against a widely expected slowdown following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>In recent months he has sent conflicting signals about the likely size and scope of extra spending to compensate for the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations and forecasts of growth for next year that have halved from around 2.2% to nearer 1%.</p> <p>Immediately after the vote he ripped up George Osborne\u2019s fiscal rule of achieving a budget surplus by the end of the parliament, and talked about the need for extra spending to create jobs and improve the country\u2019s infrastructure.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/philip-hammond-rules-out-splurge-in-public-spending-in-autumn-statement\">But he has sought to dampen expectations</a> by emphasising that he is constrained by volatile international money markets, which could drive up the government\u2019s borrowing costs if he is seen to be reckless.<br></p> <p>The weak September figures took the budget deficit to \u00a345bn for the first six months of the year, down nearly 5% from the same period in 2015. The Office for National Statistics said it could not offer a reason for the dive in corporation tax receipts.</p> <p>Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said if the public finances continued on the current trend, then borrowing would overshoot the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s (OBR) forecast of \u00a355.5bn for the financial year by about \u00a317bn.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He said: \u201cEven before the vote to leave the EU, the OBR\u2019s fiscal forecasts were looking optimistic. But the weaker economic prospects over the next few years as a result means that these forecasts are likely to be revised substantially in the autumn statement next month.\u201d</p> <p>Government expenditure since April has been kept in check, rising by \u00a35.9bn or 1.7%, to \u00a3348.7bn while tax receipts from the biggest sources of income \u2013 income tax and national insurance \u2013 increased at a faster pace. National insurance was 7% higher at \u00a359.3bn and income tax rose 2.7% to \u00a378.7bn.</p> <p>These improvements were undermined when the usually strong September corporation tax receipts proved much weaker, limiting the tax take to \u00a321bn in the first half of the year. The interest bill on the government\u2019s debts caused another headache for the Treasury after it increased by \u00a3800m, or 9%.</p> <p>The OBR said the rise in debt interest payments and a change in the monthly profile of contributions to the EU budget opened up a gap between central government expenditure and income to 4.5% from the first six months last year.</p> <p>Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the rise in government borrowing underscored the weakness of the UK economy. </p> <p>\u201cThe UK\u2019s ability to generate tax revenue has diminished following the financial crisis, and this underlying weakness is likely to be exacerbated further if the UK economy slows as we predict,\u201d he said, adding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/16/invest-in-housing-and-broadband-business-lobby-tells-chancellor\">it was vital the chancellor offered incentives</a> to \u201cinvest, create jobs, and support growth\u201d. </p> <p>Hammond said: \u201cWe have already made significant progress in bringing the public finances under control, reducing the deficit by almost two-thirds since 2010, but our debt and deficit remain too high. We remain committed to fiscal discipline and will return the budget to balance over a sensible period of time, in a way that allows us the space to support the economy as needed.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2017. An earlier version said incorrectly that corporation tax receipts fell in September to the lowest level since 2009. </p>",
  "<p>Forty years ago this week, young readers were eagerly anticipating the latest issue of their favourite British comic, <a href=\"https://bigmouthmag.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/action-comic-britains-brutal-weekly-real-70s/\">Action</a>.<br></p> <p> But the 37th issue never dropped through letterboxes. Facing a mounting wave of political and commercial pressure, the publishers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/ipc\">IPC</a> cancelled the title \u2013 even though that week\u2019s comic, cover-dated 23 October 1976, had already been printed.</p> <p> Almost 200,000 copies were pulled from distributors and sent to be pulped. Action was killed off in its prime.</p> <p> But why? A print run like that would have today\u2019s publishers salivating; according to <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/full-2015-mag-abcs-breakdown-cosmopolitan-bucks-trend-uk-magazines-decline-average-4-cent/\">Audited Bureau of Circulation figures</a> released early this year, even the once mighty Beano barely tops 33,000 weekly sales.</p> <p> But it wasn\u2019t poor sales that killed Action \u2013 quite the reverse. Kids, especially boys, were lapping it up, and that was the problem: Action was too popular and too violent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8941eaa7c0f554c1a03a70cf29a8111cb70678d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8941eaa7c0f554c1a03a70cf29a8111cb70678d/0_0_400_573/349.jpg\" alt=\"Action comic\" width=\"349\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> Strips such as Hook Jaw, about a savage Jaws-like shark; Kids Rule OK!, a post-apocalyptic thriller in which only teenagers survive; and Look Out For Lefty, which featured <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/footballviolence\">football hooliganism</a>, caused moral outrage among adults, leading directly to Action\u2019s ignominious demise.</p> <p> \u201cAction was a very important comic,\u201d says launch editor <a href=\"https://patmills.wordpress.com/\">Pat Mills</a>. \u201cIt was modern, it was exciting, but, most importantly, it didn\u2019t talk down to kids. It was about empowering them, about giving them stories where they had the power. They could relate to that. It wasn\u2019t a comic where figures of authority were in control.\u201d</p> <p> Most comics aimed at boys at the time were war comics \u2013 Victor, Warlord, Battle, and the Commando pocket books. \u201cIPC came to me and my brief was to create a comic that was as powerful as Battle,\u201d Mills recalls, \u201cbut more so \u2026 They wanted to make it a really modern comic.\u201d</p> <p> So Mills took a look around. He saw <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/punk\">punk rock</a> and football terrace violence and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-obituary\">Muhammad Ali</a> and queues outside the cinema for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jaws\">Jaws</a>. If Action was going to reflect the modern world, it had to reflect these things. So he set to work. </p> <p> The British comics industry was quite a staid, safe environment at the time. \u201cWe must have seemed like a nightmare to these guys,\u201d Mills smiles ruefully. \u201cI told the management that I was going to do a story about a black boxer and they were horrified. They said the hero would have to be a white boxer, but perhaps he could have a black sidekick. I said, \u2018Haven\u2019t you heard of Ali?\u2019\u201d</p> <p> The story did appear as Mills intended, as BlackJack, written by John Wagner. This being a comic aimed at boys, Mills also wanted a football story. Look Out for Lefty didn\u2019t just tackle the action on the pitch, but the violence on the terraces. </p> <p> Mills cheerfully admits that he took direct inspiration from the popular culture at the time. \u201cJaws was the big story, this incredible movie about a shark, a force of nature. And I wanted some of that, so we did Hook Jaw. But I didn\u2019t want it to be like King Kong \u2013 I wanted nature to win!\u201d</p> <p> One remarkable thing about Action was that it was tacitly aimed at working-class children.</p> <p>\u201cThe only time we saw working-class characters they were sidekicks, like Digby in Dan Dare, or they were figures of fun,\u201d Mills says. \u201cEven Alf Tupper, the Tough of the Track, was presented as this odd character who trained for his races in his pit boots and ate fish and chips as soon as he crossed the finishing line.</p> <p> \u201cKids got what we were trying to do immediately. There was this whole culture of punk, of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/james-herbert\">James Herbert</a> books such as The Rats, of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://richardallen.wordpress.com/\">Richard Allen</a>\u2019s Skinhead novels \u2026 It was all edgy and different, and Action was definitely a part of that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4239c9b329b58a95b4e51472cd380fa18a769d3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4239c9b329b58a95b4e51472cd380fa18a769d3c/0_0_400_577/347.jpg\" alt=\"Action comic\" width=\"347\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> Despite that, says Mills, the team putting together Action always had \u201ca definite moral compass\u201d. He says: \u201cWe weren\u2019t saying, \u2018Go and pick a fight on the terraces\u2019, but we were showing that sort of thing happened, as kids already knew.\u201d</p> <p> Action launched on 23 February and immediately began to grab headlines, notably in the Evening Standard, which ran a piece headlined: \u201cAARGH lives \u2026 but the blood is printed red.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee a youth murder five policemen,\u201d the story continued, \u201csee a body hurtle through a car window, see several limbs chomped off by today\u2019s most modish monster, the killer shark. All this and more, some in glorious Technicolor, in the new British children\u2019s comic called Action, second issue out today.\u201d</p> <p>The furore continued to mount through the spring and summer, until the magazine closed that autumn, after just 36 gloriously ultraviolent issues.</p> <p>According to Mills, it was the story Kids Rule OK! that \u201cgot us banned\u201d. Set in a world without adults where gangs of teenagers run amok, Mills acknowledges that it was a riff on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Wallis\">Dave Wallis</a>\u2019s 1964 science fiction novel Only Lovers Left Alive. The final instalment featured a gang advancing on a cowering adult, a policeman\u2019s helmet beside him on the ground.</p> <p>The Sun branded Action a \u201csevenpenny nightmare\u201d and the presenter Frank Bough tore a strip off IPC\u2019s John Sanders when he appeared on the teatime news programme Nationwide.</p> <p> \u201cThe hounds were baying for blood,\u201d says Mills. A week after the Nationwide story, Action was debated in the House of Commons. Two of the UK\u2019s biggest distributors told IPC they weren\u2019t happy, with WH Smith rumoured to have declared that unless Action was axed it would refuse to stock any IPC titles.</p> <p> Issue 37 was duly pulped, but some copies had already been sent to contributors and a few stored in the archives. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have one, you\u2019ll probably know that one <a href=\"http://downthetubes.net/?p=22473\">sold last year on eBay</a> for more than \u00a32,500.</p> <p> \u201cI feel a great sense of loss for Action,\u201d says Mills, who launched 2000AD for IPC a year later. Action returned briefly in sanitised form and was eventually merged with Battle.</p> <p> It\u2019s been gone for 40 years, but not forgotten. Mills and comic writer Kev O\u2019Neill are writing a series of novels that fictionalise the Action episode; the first in their Read \u2019Em and Weep series, Serial Killer, is published next year. Titan Comics is publishing <a href=\"http://comicsalliance.com/titan-hookjaw-spurrier-boyle-sdcc-2016/\">a </a>brand <a href=\"http://comicsalliance.com/titan-hookjaw-spurrier-boyle-sdcc-2016/\">new series of Hook Jaw</a>, starting in December. And 2000AD\u2019s current publishers, Rebellion, have acquired the rights and archives of a host of IPC titles. </p> <p>They\u2019ve just produced a collection of old strips from the girls\u2019 comic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/oct/03/misty-the-girls-comic-returning-from-the-70s-to-a-new-age-of-children\">Misty</a>, and the odds are they\u2019ll be blowing the dust off those old Action strips, so who knows?

  "<p><strong>I was born in Leeds in 1979,</strong> and grew up in the suburb of Moortown. We lived on a new estate, and had a huge garden. We were on the fifth floor, with floor-to-ceiling windows, and could see across the city. I remember loads of rainbows and sunlight beaming in.</p> <p><strong>My parents bought that home</strong> in the 70s, so there was a white carpet, glass tables and white leather furniture. I&#xa0;remember it being chic. My mum, Linda, was married at 19, but that was not considered young in the 70s. She waited until she was 23 to have me, which was considered quite reserved. My sister Candice was born 18 or 19 months after me. My youngest sister, Rhea, was born four-and-a-half years after me.</p> <p><strong>My dad, Chris, is from St Kitts.</strong> He worked in computers. I remember the first laptop when he brought it home. People from primary school came to check it out \u2013 it was huge.</p> <p><strong>My mum would take us to ballet,</strong> and we used to go as a family to Brownies. My dad used to take us to Saturday music school. My parents would never say: \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to practice your violin now before tea.\u201d We were self-motivated.</p> <p><strong>We went to Baptist church</strong> as a family, and that took up so many nights a week. We would go to weddings and see our mum and aunties dancing, and, when our cousins came round, we would make up plays and dances. I&#xa0;used to play music in the services, and at 13 or 14 would lead the whole church of 200 people.</p> <p><strong>My dad is one of six,</strong> and my mum is one of four, so I had lots of cousins. And the two families lived nearby. My nanna and grandad lived in a big house in Chapeltown, and we would be there every Sunday with our cousins, and my&#xa0;nanna would cook St Kitts\u2019 dishes. My dad\u2019s parents were also building a&#xa0;house back in St Kitts. And they finished their dream house, with mango and guava trees and roses, and went back when I was 16 or 17.</p> <p><strong>My mum\u2019s mum was really sociable. </strong>She grew up in the working men\u2019s clubs culture, and would sing and tap dance. She was an entertaining granny: she used to do karaoke and we used to have parties at her house.</p> <p><strong>My parents got divorced</strong> for the same reason that most people\u2019s parents get&#xa0;divorced: the relationship had stopped working. I was about 12 or 13.&#xa0;But our&#xa0;families are still close, and&#xa0;we will&#xa0;be together for Christmas, Easter, birthdays and Mother\u2019s Day. In&#xa0;Caribbean culture, extended family is a solid unit.</p> <p><strong>My mum was fine about me leaving</strong> home to go to university in Leeds: she still had two daughters at home. She was really into salsa, so she used to be out every Thursday night at the club where I worked. She\u2019s a hip mum.</p> <p><strong>My sister Candice is a Labour councillor</strong> for Hounslow and really into social justice, and Rhea is an actor.</p> <p><strong>I have learned about marriage</strong> from people in our church. I would see those guys talk and discuss and argue and be fine. So I felt a marriage could be really elastic in that sense. People whose parents are divorced think that as soon as you have an argument it\u2019s all over, but a good marriage is robust.

It\u2019s also at the center of recent prisoner strikes across the country, and is the only place where correctional officers have gone on strike as well. On 6 October the US Department of Justice (DoJ) announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/06/alabama-prison-doj-investigation\">state-wide investigation</a> of Alabama\u2019s prisons for men, targeting sex abuse, violence, and generally unsafe conditions for both prisoners and officers. Such a colossal investigation is, according to legal experts, unprecedented.</p> <p>Current employees at the prison are afraid to discuss conditions inside. But Lt Curt Stidham agreed to meet and describe life at the prison for the Guardian. He left Holman this summer but Holman hasn\u2019t left him; at a local pizza place he insisted on sitting in the corner, facing the doors. \u201cI need to be able to see,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find all the officers are like this.\u201d</p> <p>He sketched a layout of the prison on a napkin, and described the hierarchy of officers. \u201cThere\u2019s the warden at the top, then two captains, and then lieutenants,\u201d he said. As a lieutenant his first order every day was to figure out how many of his shift officers had reported for duty. The prison is run by a staff as thin as the razor wire that surrounds the prison. Sometimes as few as nine guards would try to control the entire population, Stidham said. </p> <p>And how big is the population?</p> <p>\u201cNine-hundred fifty,\u201d he said, in a facility built to house 637.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5069519dea1e2719864e69d07f5b571f861fba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5069519dea1e2719864e69d07f5b571f861fba/0_0_3588_2153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curt Stidham recently resigned as a guard at Holman prison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curt Stidham recently resigned as a guard at Holman prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Teague/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The department of corrections confirmed Stidham\u2019s allegations. \u201cOver-population and understaffing, yes,\u201d said Bob Horton, spokesman for Alabama\u2019s prisons.

It had two wire fences and six towers, which should have given guards a constant view from every angle. But today it\u2019s a shell game \u2013 typically only two of the towers are manned at any time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37eac1540dfe96e7e27553804439bf46f59e0884\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37eac1540dfe96e7e27553804439bf46f59e0884/0_204_3918_2350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A guard tower at Holman penitentiary in southern Alabama.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A guard tower at Holman penitentiary in southern Alabama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Teague/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first warden at Holman, Novy Lee Hale, toured the prison with his granddaughter, Teresa.

They arrived in droves, and they stayed longer; Lisa Graybill, a prisons expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center, called it a \u201csentencing binge\u201d.</p> <p>Now Alabama has the nation\u2019s most overcrowded prison system. It was built to hold 13,318 inmates. According to the department of correction\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.doc.state.al.us/docs/MonthlyRpts/2016-08.pdf\">latest report</a>, in August, the population now exceeds 24,000. </p> <p>That means officers have to cut corners, according to Stidham, the recently resigned lieutenant. Regulations might call for two officers to transport a prisoner, for instance, but there\u2019s only one available. Or a lone guard might stand at the door of a dorm housing 115 inmates; if a group of prisoners assaults another one, it\u2019s that guard\u2019s job to wade into the chaos and protect the victim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Stidham unfurled a canvas jacket on the trunk of his car, revealing dozens of prison-made knives.

In September he got word that one of his officers, 44-year-old Kenneth Bettis, had refused to give a prisoner an extra tray of food, and the prisoner had stabbed him in the temple with an icepick-like weapon.</p> <p>While Bettis was in the hospital the prisoners staged a strike on 9 September, refusing to work in the prison\u2019s kitchen or the license-plate production plant. Inmates at other prisons across the US enacted similar plans, involving as many as 24,000 prisoners who demanded safer living conditions.</p> <p>A few days later Bettis, the guard, died in the hospital. That night the officers from Bettis\u2019s shift all gathered at a gas station off the prison grounds and discussed how to respond. Someone suggested officers call in sick during an extended \u201cblue flu\u201d. Others were angrier. They decided to skip work for one day, as a protest of Holman\u2019s treacherous conditions.

  "<p>A new law designed to cut the high rate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/22/observer-editorial-sex-selection-law-amendment\">sex-selective abortions</a> in Armenia is inadequate, limiting women\u2019s reproductive choices and putting lives at risk, according to women\u2019s rights groups.</p> <p>The ex-Soviet country, with a population of just under 3 million, has the third highest rate of abortion of female foetuses in the world, behind <a href=\"http://www.unfpa.am/sites/default/files/Sex_Imbalance_report_Eng_final-with%20cover-final.pdf\">China and Azerbaijan</a>. </p> <p>In August, the government outlawed sex-selective terminations in response to pressure from the international community and the United Nations Population Fund (Unfpa), which warned of an impending demographic crisis because of the number of foetuses being aborted due to their gender.</p> <p>Since the fall of the Soviet Union rates of sex-selection <a href=\"http://www.unfpa.am/sites/default/files/Sex_Imbalance_report_Eng_final-with%20cover-final.pdf\">have risen in </a><a href=\"http://www.unfpa.am/sites/default/files/Sex_Imbalance_report_Eng_final-with%20cover-final.pdf\">Armenia</a>, meaning that while approximately 105 boys were born for every 100 girls (around the natural rate) in 1991, by 2015 the figure had changed to 115 boys for every 100 girls. </p> <p>Under the new law, a woman seeking an abortion must attend a counselling session with her doctor and then wait for three days for the procedure. The government says this is to allow doctors to pass on information about the dangers of abortion.</p> <p>But local women\u2019s rights activists have criticised the new rules for keeping the burden of choice on the woman<strong> </strong>and warn that, instead of curbing the practice, the law could actually limit access to safe reproductive care and force women into choosing riskier forms of abortion.</p> <p>Ani Jilozian at the Women\u2019s Support Centre in the capital, Yerevan, says the law is a \u201cband-aid solution\u201d that focuses on reducing sex-selective abortions without addressing the causes: poor socio-economic conditions and patriarchal values.</p> <p>\u201cIn traditional Armenian families, daughters-in-law move in with their husband\u2019s family \u2026 [and] the eldest son is the one to care for the parents,\u201d says Jilozian. In a country with almost no social security net, this tradition means boys remain the favoured offspring.</p> <h2>Soviet legacy</h2> <p>Armenia\u2019s long history of easy access to abortion is one of the legacies of the Soviet Union, which was the first state to legalise the procedure in 1921. A widespread mistrust of contraception means abortion has remained the primary method of birth control.</p> <p>Armenia\u2019s birthrate has also dropped in the post-Soviet period: at present, 1.5 children are born per family, compared with 2.5 in the 1980s, according to birth registration figures <a href=\"http://www.unfpa.am/sites/default/files/Sex_Imbalance_report_Eng_final-with%20cover-final.pdf)\">collected by the UNFPA</a>. And if a family plans to have only one or two children, there is more pressure to ensure one of them will be a boy, Jilozian explains.</p> <p>Economic hardship and the arrival <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Highlights%20&amp;%20Features/eca/armenia/missing-girls-report-english.pdf\">by the end of the 1990s</a> of sonogram technology, which can predict a foetus\u2019s sex , are also said to be contributing factors to the rise. </p> <p>Such is the scale of the problem in Gegharkunik, a region in the east of the country, that<a href=\"http://www.epress.am/en/2016/09/26/domestic-violence-natural-part-of-family-life-in-armenias-gegharkunik-province.html\"> the Women\u2019s Resource Centre Armenia</a> (WRCA) has instigated a campaign against gender-based violence, which included discussions on sex-selective abortion. </p> <p>Women they spoke to described the pressure they were under to produce boys. One said that her first child was a daughter, but then she had four abortions before she conceived a son.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women are going to continue to have sex-selective abortions, but the risk of unsafe abortions is a lot higher'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another woman said she had paid 150,000 drams (\u00a3260), the average monthly salary in Armenia, for an illegal abortion. The current legal limit for a termination is 12 weeks, after which it is only allowed for certain \u201csocial\u201d reasons, such as if the woman was raped or is a single mother.</p> <p>Others claimed doctors asked pregnant woman if they wanted to abort their female foetus, and for a fee offered to perform the procedure at home.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Jilozian is dubious about whether a law on its own will help women like those the WRCA spoke to in Gegharkunik. Without an overhaul of the patriarchal social structures<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>\u201cwomen are going to continue to have sex-selective abortions at the same rate, but the risk of having unsafe abortions is a lot higher\u201d, she argues.</p> <p>Human rights lawyer Gabriel Armas-Cardona is also concerned that the mandatory waiting period in the bill is in contravention of human rights concerning access to healthcare. \u201cUNFPA Armenia is adamant that something needs to be done to the point where they\u2019ll even tolerate policies that violate human rights,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For Lara Aharonian, co-founder of the WRCA, the focus on the abortion procedure is misplaced. She believes sex-selective abortion should be seen as part of a broader problem with gender inequality in Armenia.</p> <p>\u201cIf you really want to eradicate sex-selective abortion, you go to the core of the problem,\u201d she says. \u201cHow boys and girls are raised differently, the gender roles, breaking gender stereotypes.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A Ukrainian seaman has died after falling from a height on a ship stranded for months off the North Tyneside coast.<br></p> <p>The accident happened on the Brasschaat bulk carrier, which has been anchored in the North Sea since June after its owner went bust.</p> <p>A coastguard helicopter was called shortly after 2.20pm on Thursday to reports that a person had fallen from a height.</p> <p>Fellow crew performed CPR in an attempt to save the man\u2019s life before paramedics and a doctor arrived. Northumbria police confirmed on Friday that the 29-year-old man had died. </p> <p>The Brasschaat bulk carrier is one of three ships that have been anchored a mile and a half out to sea near Tynemouth since June. They were owned by a Belgian company, Sobelmar, which hit financial problems last year, and have been managed by an India-based crewing agency, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, since June.</p> <p>It is understood that the man, who has not yet been named, had been onboard the Brasschaat since 20 June.</p> <p>A spokesman for Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said on Friday: \u201cIt is with deep regret that we confirm that a crew member serving on board the managed vessel MV Brasschaat suffered a fatal accident yesterday afternoon whilst carrying out his shipboard duties.</p> <p>\u201cNext of kin were immediately informed and a full investigation into the cause of the accident is now under way by all the relevant authorities. The deceased individual was a Ukrainian national. No other details are being released at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Police officers were on board the 179m-long Brasschaat as it was brought to shore at Northumbrian Quay in North Shields on Friday for investigation. It is understood that the Brasschaat shipmaster is due to give a statement to police about the man\u2019s death. Fifteen seafarers remain onboard the vessel.</p> <p>Local residents have previously expressed concerns that the three ships are eyesores blighting the Tynemouth coastline. </p> <p>One resident of nearby Whitley Bay, <a href=\"http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/three-carrier-ships-been-left-11741438\">quoted by Newcastle\u2019s Evening Chronicle</a> in August, said: \u201cI don\u2019t want our coast to become a kind of dumping ground for container ships.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere are three of them a couple of miles offshore which are sitting high up in the water so it doesn\u2019t look like they have any cargo. I don\u2019t know if they have a skeleton crew but they seem empty and they\u2019ve been there for ages.\u201d</p> <p>The Brasschaat was named after its home district in Flanders, while the other stranded ships, Vyritsa and Zarechensk, have Russian names.<br></p> <p>Sobelmar, whose contracts included fertilisers, grain and coal, shipped between Murmansk in Russia and western Europe and the Baltics. The firm was reported to be seeking bankruptcy protection last year after restructuring talks with its German bank broke down. This year the lender HSH Nordbank was granted control over the four-bulker fleet, according to the shipping news service TradeWinds.</p> <p>It is thought that the three ships off North Tyneside\u2019s coast had initially been part of Sobelmar\u2019s plans to renovate an ageing fleet. It is not clear how they came to be in the north-east, but Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement has an office in Newcastle.</p>",

Too bad we can't try them | Jean Hannah Edelstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I was 16 years old, I lied about my age and got a job working in the Hostess Twinkie factory in Natick, Massachusetts. Going in at 7 am in my brand new work boots, dollar signs dancing in front of my eyes, I felt mighty good. Coming out at 4 in the afternoon was a different story. </p> <p>That night, I returned covered in sweet, white chemical goo. I could barely walk and nausea danced a merry jig from my gut up to my eyeballs. You just try standing on the floor with two conveyor belts in front of you, each moving at a different speed. One has Twinkies, one has cardboard boxes, and you have to put six Twinkies in each box. You can\u2019t miss one or it squelches on the floor further down the line. You can\u2019t vomit no matter how seasick you are. You can\u2019t scream. You can\u2019t move. You can\u2019t pee. You might die if you have to do this one more minute. Turns out, you really might die.</p> <p>A recent study found that the less control you have over your job, the more likely you are to drop dead. Researchers studied 2,363 Wisconsin residents in their 60s for seven years, and found that \u201cthose in high-stress jobs with little control over their workflow die younger or are less healthy than those who have more flexibility and discretion in their jobs and are able to set their own goals as part of their employment.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/rude-co-workers-contagious-job-atmosphere\">Are your coworkers rude? Careful \u2013 it's catching | Jean Hannah Edelstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They also found that people with less control in demanding jobs were 15.4% more likely to die than those with more liberty to structure their own timelines and goals. They recommend that employers ease up a bit, for the good of all and suggest \u201cjob crafting,\u201d which involves employees to redesign their jobs to make them more meaningful.</p> <p>The more freedom employees in stressful jobs have, in other words, the more they flourish. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re in a Twinkie factory or managing a hedge fund \u2013 if you get to choose when you have your coffee break and what you want to get done before that, you\u2019re more likely to be productive, and to live to work another day. If the boss lays off trying to control you all the time, you also get better at your job.</p> <p>These research subjects were a bunch of 60-year-olds, but the principles easily transfer to managing, say, 6-year-olds. We parents know this \u2013 give \u2018em freedom (or the illusion of freedom) and they\u2019ll grow in confidence and become more competent human beings. </p> <p>Job angst is very real. In Japan, there is a word for dropping dead from work stress: karoshi. However, let us remember the word for dropping dead from no work and no possibility of work: starvation. Sure, spending your days feeling seasick in a Twinkie factory is awful. But spending your days wondering how you\u2019re going to feed your children has to be worse. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/employers-cant-force-you-to-be-happy-labor-relations-board\">It's official: employers can't force you to be happy.

  "<p>Of all the antique sculptures that were rediscovered in the Renaissance, and which infused and possessed the imaginations of later generations of artists, it is hard to think of one more powerful than the statue of the sleeping Ariadne in the Pio Clementino museum in the Vatican. Probably a Roman copy of a Hellenistic original, it was acquired by Pope Julius II in 1512. He displayed it as part of an elaborate fountain installation, with water playing around the sleepily recumbent figure. At the time, that figure was identified not as the mythical heroine Ariadne, but as Cleopatra \u2013 partly because of the snaky bracelet that coils round one of her upper arms, thought to depict the queen\u2019s asp. For Pope Julius, the sculpture had tremendous symbolic appeal: he was the conquering Roman, the heir of the Caesars, she was the subjugated Egyptian ruler. At the same time, through some intriguing act of intellectual slippage, she was, by virtue of her watery setting, a nymph in a grotto \u2013 erotic, sensual, hovering in some delicate reverie between sleep, death and wakefulness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a609652e8c0255e67b95510d26cffd70bb4c51e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a609652e8c0255e67b95510d26cffd70bb4c51e3/0_66_1297_947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Ariadne, Phrygian marble.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Ariadne, Phrygian marble.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Musei Vaticani, Museo Pio-Clementino</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sculpture is not, at the moment, on public view. To see it now, one must apply for a pass and be conducted solemnly past the scarlet cords that separate the rush of visitors from the <em>sala degli animali</em> \u2013 a stone menagerie of harts, boars, bulls, wolves and foxes that look as if they have just been petrified by the imperious wand of a passing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Witch\">White Witch</a>. Beyond the frozen animals, there opens up a long corridor of antique sculptures, over which Ariadne \u2013 as she is now known, after a scholarly reidentification in the late 18th century \u2013 presides from her niche at the end, flanked by the magnificent Barberini candelabra (said to have been excavated at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/19/history\">Hadrian\u2019s villa</a> in Tivoli). She is thrillingly solid, enormous, a great weight of limbs encased in stony drapery, her left hand pillowing her cheek, her right thrown back over her head. This is Ariadne at the moment of waking on the shore of the island of Naxos, where she has been abandoned by Theseus after helping him to kill the Minotaur on Crete. When Ariadne sees Theseus\u2019s ship sailing away towards the horizon, she will, after her first despair, rain down terrible curses on him, as well she might: she was very much the brains of the Minotaur-slaying operation, supplying the hero with a sword and a thread by which to find his way out of the labyrinth. Later, she will encounter the god Bacchus and his tipsy train of followers, and he will transform her into a beautiful constellation that will shine ever more out of the night sky.</p> <p>The sculpture also blazes a trail through art history. You can see her traces everywhere: in the pose, most obviously, of innumerable naked Titian beauties (<a href=\"http://www.abcgallery.com/T/titian/titian19.html\">in the foreground of <em>The Andrians</em></a>, for example; and in his various Dana\u00ebs, penetrated by Zeus as a shower of gold). There are echoes in Bernini\u2019s extraordinary sculpture of the Blessed Ludovica Albertoni in the church of San Francesco a Ripa in Rome: the recumbent woman is writhing in pain, or pleasure. You can see a version of her (another, similar sculpture owned by the Medicis) in a beautiful tiny landscape by Vel\u00e1zquez. Nicolas Poussin made a little wax copy of her to keep in his studio. She\u2019s in the elaborate landscaped gardens of Stourhead, Wiltshire, this time in the dark and ferny embrace of a real dripping grotto \u2013 as a nymph commissioned in the 18th century by the fabulously rich banker Henry Hoare from John Cheere. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/jan/26/1\">Giorgio de Chirico </a>obsessed over her, almost certainly without ever having seen the original statue. He depicted the sculpture in a series of eight paintings produced in Paris between 1912 and 1913. His Ariadnes lie in near-deserted city squares whose porticoed buildings throw out sharp shadows against the evening light. They exhale melancholy and isolation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e5418d690d1ed502526909b3a2ff7e444b9fab1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e5418d690d1ed502526909b3a2ff7e444b9fab1/0_37_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Titian\u2019s Danae, painted in 1544.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Titian\u2019s <em>Danae</em>, painted in 1544.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Crabtree/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just over a decade later, another version of Ariadne made her appearance, this time painted by a female hand. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/jan/26/1\">Dod Procter</a>, born Doris Margaret Shaw in 1890, grew up in Newlyn, Cornwall, where she studied at the art school established by Elizabeth and Stanhope Forbes, and later at Atelier Colarossi in Paris, where she absorbed the work of impressionist and post-impressionist painters. After the first world war she returned to Cornwall with her artist husband Ernest Procter, and in the 1920s worked on monumental paintings of solitary women.</p> <p>Her <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/procter-morning-n04270\"><em>Morning</em> </a>(1926) shows a woman, asleep and perhaps on the verge of waking, with her right arm thrown back over her head. George Eliot\u2019s description of the Vatican Ariadne, in <em>Middlemarch</em>, might also serve to describe Procter\u2019s subject: \u201cShe lies in the marble voluptuousness of her beauty, the drapery folding around her with a petal-like ease and tenderness.\u201d Well, not marble: paint. But even so, the white sheets and nightgown that Procter has arranged around her model strongly recall the pale chilliness of antique sculpture. View the image in a certain way and you could almost feel that the stony solidity of those sheets was consuming the young woman, like some heroine from Ovid\u2019s <em>Metamorphoses</em> being steadily transformed into a rocky outcrop. But despite the cool density of that cotton drapery, the figure is a sensuous being, fleshy and pink, and her left fingers \u2013 departing from the original pose \u2013 hover suggestively around her crotch, not unlike the exploring hand of Fragonard\u2019s female subject in <a href=\"http://collections.frick.org/media/view/Objects/172/6523?t:state:flow=0b1039bf-e2ee-4ea2-b72b-891b08940ca2\"><em>Reverie</em> in the Frick Collection</a> in New York. The sitter for Procter\u2019s painting was Cissie Barnes, the 16-year-old daughter of a Newlyn fisherman, and there\u2019s an ordinariness here: she\u2019s very definitely not a mythical heroine, even if we\u2019re being reminded of her Renaissance and classical forebears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1c763cc74c939d5547ac93dbc00177beb5e2622c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c763cc74c939d5547ac93dbc00177beb5e2622c/176_75_3237_2726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Marguerite Kelsey by Meredith Frampton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"842\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portrait of Marguerite Kelsey by Meredith Frampton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are two versions of Procter\u2019s painting. One belongs to the Tate, bought for the nation by the Daily Mail after it was voted \u201cpicture of the year\u201d at the 1927 Royal Academy summer exhibition. A smaller version,<em> Early Morning</em>, owned by the Royal Pavilion and Museums, Brighton and Hove, will be on loan to Pallant House Gallery this autumn for its<em> </em>exhibition <em>The Mythic Method</em>. Its curator, Simon Martin, has excavated a seam of British art made between 1920 and 1950 that explores a kind of modernist classicism. His title comes from TS Eliot\u2019s 1923 essay \u201cUlysses, Order and Myth\u201d, in which the poet argued that James Joyce\u2019s \u201cmythical method\u201d, his means of deploying Homer\u2019s <em>Odyssey</em>, represented \u201ca step toward making the modern world possible for art\u201d; \u201ca way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history\u201d.</p> <p>Martin\u2019s artists include painters such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/may/13/walk-through-british-art-tate-britain-rehang\">Meredith Frampton</a>, whose deliciously frosty portraits channel<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/04/frick-collection-masterpieces-mauritshuis-the-hague\"> Ingres </a>and Flemish painters such as Hans Memling as much as antique models. One would struggle, in fact, to see in such works \u2013 and those by artists such as William Roberts and <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/ithell-colquhoun-931\">Ithell Colquhoun</a> \u2013 precise visual analogues to Joyce\u2019s joyful prose. And yet Martin\u2019s thesis is that these artists are engaged in a project that has some kind of parallel with <em>Ulysses</em>, insofar as they are also using myth, or classicism more generally, to give a shape to the \u201cimmense panorama of futility and anarchy\u201d of the postwar world. Their way of co-opting the classics is through clean lines and ordered compositions, in bathers and shepherds and broken antique columns; it is all rather far from the generosity, wit and bodily exuberance of <em>Ulysses</em>.</p> <p>An art that is poised, monumental, static, cool: some of the works from the 1930s resemble what one might lazily think of as fascist art \u2013 but without the actual fascism. Under only slightly different political circumstances, some of this stuff could have been co-opted with ease towards far-right faux-heroics. On the other hand, one of the works in the exhibition is a series of studies by Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant of elegantly classicising figures (flavoured strongly too with influences of Piero della Francesca). They were preparatory sketches for a mural in John Maynard Keynes\u2019s rooms in King\u2019s College, Cambridge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5b8fce5a55733d9f206bdf4136437b60303c9369\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b8fce5a55733d9f206bdf4136437b60303c9369/0_0_3600_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ernest Proctor\u2019s The Day's End, 1927.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"850\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ernest Proctor\u2019s <em>The Day\u2019s End</em>, 1927.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Leicester Arts and Museums Service</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Martin argues that classical compositions created a safe arena in which difficult, sometimes unspeakable, subjects could be tackled or at times defused \u2013 not just Procter\u2019s vision of female sensuality, but the matter of the first world war and all the pain and chaos that went with it. He points to Francis Derwent Wood\u2019s memorial to the Machine Gun Corps, a familiar sight to those passing Hyde Park Corner in London. There\u2019s no hint of machine gunnery and all the filthy savagery that that must have involved, but rather a heroically naked youth, one leg bent, one hand on his hip, holding a sword by his side. Martin says that the sculptor was thinking of antique models such as the Hermes of Praxiteles, but the pose recalls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/oct/04/art\">Benvenuto Cellini\u2019s bronze Perseus,</a> holding aloft the bloody head of the gorgon Medusa. Derwent Wood, by contrast, sublimates any hint of violence.</p> <p>All sorts of things are sublimated by artists shown in <em>The Mythic Method</em>. The painter Lancelot Glasson was another artist to use the Vatican Ariadne as a model; Martin argues that his painting <em>Repose</em>, of two naked girls languidly picnicking atop a cliff, takes an intriguing interest in bodily perfection, given that Glasson himself lost a leg in the war. is subjects in the 1920s and 30s were often nudes, or athletes, or both.</p> <p>The second world war heralded another turn of the screw for the kind of art Martin has brought together. A classical world is also a world in ruins. An untitled 1939 canvas by Frank Runacres shows a kind of perverted version of D\u00fcrer\u2019s famous print <em>Melancholia</em>. A brooding female figure sits in the centre of both works, but in his version, Runacres has collapsed statuary, columns, marble torsos and timber over her head in a chaotic heap. The blitz had not yet happened. When it did, the fluted columns of Wren churches would lie wrecked and broken and Henry Moore\u2019s figures would huddle in the tube like the wraithlike denizens of Hades or wind their wool like implacable, terrifying Fates.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Mythic Method: Classicism in British Art 1920-50</em> is at <a href=\"http://www.pallant.org.uk/\">Pallant House Gallery, Chichester</a>, from 22 October to 19 February 2017.</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>Donald Trump has boasted of being the law and order candidate, but legal scholars and ex-government ethics officials have warned against what they see as his cavalier attitude toward potential conflicts of interest and the rule of law, based on the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s rhetoric and policy stances.</p> <p>Specifically, ethics and legal scholars say that Trump\u2019s notion of creating a supposed \u201cblind trust\u201d for his businesses, if he becomes president, that would let his children run the Trump Organization without an independent trustee is risible. Trump told Fox News last month: \u201cI will sever my connections and I\u2019ll have my children and my executives run the company, and I wouldn\u2019t discuss it with them.\u201d</p> <p>He told CNN last month that \u201cI would most likely put it in a blind trust and they [his children and executives] would run it, or something.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2016/apr/21/donald-trump-brand-white-house-business-empire\">Why winning the White House would be the best deal of Donald Trump's business career</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, legal experts say, is not how a blind trust is supposed to work. Richard Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer for President George W Bush, says that in a true blind trust \u201cthe trustee has to be independent of the office holder and certainly not the sons and daughter\u201d. Additionally, he said, Trump would have to sell off his real estate assets and an independent trustee would then have to place his funds or investments in a new trust without revealing the contents to Trump or his children.</p> <p>Other legal scholars concur. \u201cAbsent a truly blind trust, Mr Trump would be able to make decisions that could benefit his business interests,\u201d says Lloyd H Mayer, a law professor and tax specialist at Notre Dame. \u201cNothing Trump has said indicates he\u2019s interested in setting up a truly blind trust where neither he, nor his family members, nor his close associates would know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>The criticisms of Trump\u2019s blind trust proposal echo other recent controversies over legal issues over which Trump has faced fire from scholars and former government officials for challenging, or ignoring, social and legal norms through his policy stances.</p> <p>Some legal scholars, for instance, note that Trump has shown contempt for press freedoms by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">advocating changing the libel laws</a> to make it easier to sue the media \u2013 and \u201cmake lots of money\u201d in Trump\u2019s words \u2013 while using inflammatory words to paint a picture of a vast press conspiracy ranged against him.</p> <p>Painter sees Trump\u2019s talk of changing libel laws as glib and dangerous since he \u201cdoesn\u2019t acknowledge there\u2019s a constitutional problem\u201d, given the first amendment right to free speech.</p> <p>In a similar vein, Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-us-election-result\">stonewalling and equivocating over whether he would accept the election results</a> \u2013 win or lose \u2013 drew widespread bipartisan fire as a rebuke to the principles of democracy.<br></p> <h2>Conflicts of interest</h2> <p>Most recent presidents have taken pains to curb conflicts of interest or appearance problems \u2013 even though the president and vice-president are exempt from the conflict of interest statute that other executive branch officials have to follow.</p> <p>But legal scholars say that Trump would potentially face more conflict of interest problems than previous presidents given the global nature of his real estate empire and business dealings \u2013 from Azerbaijan to Turkey and from China to India \u2013which could be impacted by government economic or foreign policy decisions and often involve licensing agreements with his name and brand on hotels plus residential and office properties.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents, who have used blind trusts to hold and manage their assets while in office, this kind of arrangement would not work for Trump because he has integrated his children into the management of his business operation, and his assets are so closely tied to his name and identity,\u201d says Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University who specializes in legal ethics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c1008c96c9f33cdd5fc5d9a8f7cae7d3752e6c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c1008c96c9f33cdd5fc5d9a8f7cae7d3752e6c8/173_0_4526_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Frey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further, Trump and his businesses could face legal risks under the constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, an ethics measure that bars a president from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments, or entities controlled by those governments. Painter points out that Trump\u2019s real estate empire has often relied on foreign bank loans \u2013 including from the Bank of China \u2013 which could create problems if new loans were made, or old ones renegotiated, under terms that deviated from normal rates, thus giving Trump\u2019s businesses a financial edge.</p> <p>Other experts agree that the emoluments clause could impact Trump\u2019s businesses. \u201cIf Donald Trump\u2019s business arrangements involve his receiving payments, directly or indirectly, from a foreign government or an entity it controls, that would violate the emoluments clause,\u201d Clark said.</p> <p>As legal criticism has escalated of Trump\u2019s unusual concept of a blind trust, his son Eric Trump last month tried to defend it in an ABC television interview by noting that his father would not make decisions as \u201cit relates to the company\u201d, and that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be involved in government\u201d.</p> <p>Those broad assertions haven\u2019t quieted critics of Trump\u2019s notion of a blind trust. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have cosmetic value because his interests are presumably aligned with his kids\u2019,\u201d says Ken Gross, a partner with Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom.</p>",

However, the ECJ referred the final decision back to the Scottish courts.</p> <p>The SWA has been backed by two major European producers\u2019 associations and nine EU member states, including France and Spain. It argued the measure was disproportionate, as it penalised every consumer and restricted free competition, whereas using taxation would still allow retailers to set their own prices, and compete against each other. </p> <p>But health campaigners argue that only minimum unit pricing (MUP) effectively targets the cheap alcohol most often consumed by young people and dependent drinkers, while having only a small impact on those who drink moderately, including low-income moderate drinkers.</p> <p>In Friday\u2019s ruling, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, wrote that the policy did not contravene European law. </p> <p>Rejecting the argument by the SWA that there is no evidence a general reduction in the population\u2019s alcohol consumption would have any significant health benefit, Carloway argued that an increase in hazardous levels of drinking in Scotland could be linked to the availability of cheap alcohol. \u201cThe fact that the legislation would affect moderate drinkers in some way does not detract from the legitimacy of the aim as a measure designed for the general protection of public health and life.\u201d</p> <p>The Scottish government\u2019s public health minister, Aileen Campbell, said: \u201cI am delighted that the highest court in Scotland has reinforced the initial judgment in our favour from 2013.

We hope that minimum pricing will now be put in place as quickly as possible so we can start seeing the benefits.\u201d</p> <p>Following the judgment, campaigners in England called on the UK government to follow Scotland\u2019s lead. David Cameron floated a minimum price of 40p a unit for England and Wales under pressure from the medical profession and the police, but later rejected minimum pricing.</p> <p>Emily Robinson, deputy chief executive at Alcohol Concern, said: \u201cThe aim of MUP is to protect the young and the vulnerable, heavy drinker so it\u2019s been troubling to see a powerful section of the alcohol industry using their huge resources to oppose this and put profits before people\u2019s health.</p> <p> \u201cAll the evidence shows that MUP will save thousands of lives, the economy millions and cut alcohol-related crime so we look forward to its introduction and hope our government will follow suit.\u201d</p> <p>The Sheffield Alcohol Research Group, from the University of Sheffield, which has been studying the effects of minimum unit pricing since 2008, says it has found the policy to be consistently effective and well-targeted.</p> <p>The group estimates that introducing a 50p minimum unit price in Scotland would result in 60 fewer deaths, 1,300 fewer hospital admissions and 3,500 fewer crimes due to alcohol within the first year. </p>",

  "<p>Dozens of US states have accused a British multinational company of \u201cshamelessly preying on patients in need of help\u201d by profiteering from a drug at the forefront of combating America\u2019s opioid epidemic. </p> <p>Thirty-five states <a href=\"http://ncdoj.gov/getdoc/bf3cc3e1-a9d8-4a03-bcde-eec0ca8fdd2f/Suboxone-complaint.aspx\">are suing</a> Reckitt Benckiser for allegedly running \u201can unlawful, multi-pronged scheme\u201d using patent laws and false safety concerns to dominate the market and maintain an artificially high price for Suboxone, a drug used to fight addiction to prescription painkillers and heroin. Federal authorities have been investigating the company over similar issues for the past four years. </p> <p>In 2010, Reckitt \u2013 which manufactures well-known brands in the UK from household cleaners to Durex condoms \u2013 was fined after it admitted manipulating Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) to direct doctors away from a rival generic and toward one of its own more expensive drugs. Two years earlier a company whistleblower revealed memos that showed executives spoke about using safety and patent issues to maintain market dominance. </p> <p>The legal action comes amid federal investigations and congressional hearings into the escalating costs of treatments and life-saving drugs used to combat an opioid addiction crisis that has claimed more than 250,000 lives in the US over the past 15 years. </p> <p>Suboxone contains two drugs \u2013 a painkiller, buprenorphine, and an opiate blocker, naloxone \u2013 which were out of patent at the time the medicine came on to the market. But in 2002 Reckitt was granted a seven-year licence to exclusively sell Suboxone tablets because of its work devising and testing the drug. </p> <p>It went on to earn Reckitt hundreds of millions of dollars a year as the opioid crisis widened and the number of patients seeking treatment for painkiller or heroin addiction rose. Government programmes such as Medicaid met the cost of treatment for some people. </p> <p>The legal action by the states and the District of Columbia alleges that shortly before its Suboxone licence expired in 2009 the company conspired with a New Jersey firm, MonoSol RX, to create a new version of the drug as a film dissolved under the tongue. It has a patent until 2022. </p> <p>Reckitt is accused of having incrementally increased the price of its tablets until they were 50% more expensive than the film in order to encourage patients and doctors to switch. According to the lawsuit, once most prescriptions had moved to the film, the company took the tablets off the market. </p> <p>Reckitt then allegedly expressed \u201cunfounded concerns\u201d to the Food and Drug Administration about children getting access to Suboxone tablets in order to delay approval of generic versions of the drug. The company <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.naabt.org/documents/Reckitt_Benckiser_Pharmaceuticals_Inc_2012_FDA_Citizen_Petition.pdf\">filed papers with the FDA</a> claiming that the packaging for its film was more difficult for children to open than the bottles for Suboxone tablets. The safety claim was based on a single study paid for by Reckitt. </p> <p>The FDA took two years to reject the move and suggested that pills were probably safer than film. But by then Reckitt had ensured that 85% of prescriptions were written for the film version of Suboxone, earning it about $1bn a year \u2013 20% of the company\u2019s profits.</p> <p>The states taking legal action contend that this was a device to delay the sale of generic Suboxone tablets and allow Reckitt to keep the price of its film, and profits, artificially high. The company is facing questions as to why, if it believed selling Suboxone in bottles put children at risk, it did not act while it was still using them and why it continued to sell its pill version in bottles in other parts of the world.</p> <p>The US\u2019s Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation of Reckitt in 2012. Two years later, Reckitt sold off Suboxone manufacturing as a new company, Indivior. </p> <p>In September, Senator Edward Markey <a href=\"http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/LTR-FTC-Suboxone%20antitrust%209-27-16.pdf\">wrote to</a> the chair of the FTC, Edith Ramirez, requesting it to use \u201cthe full force of its authority to accelerate its investigation\u201d into whether the company and others have \u201cthwarted competition, unlawfully increased profits or illegally extended monopolies\u201d. Markey also accused it of attempting to stall the investigation by withholding thousands of documents from the FTC. </p> <p>Reckitt did not respond to a request for comment. Indivior, which is also named in the lawsuit, said: \u201cWe cannot comment in detail about pending litigation, but we disagree with a number of the claims made by the attorneys general, and we will contest this lawsuit vigorously.\u201d </p> <p>MonoSol Rx said the allegations \u201care wholly without merit and the suit is both factually and legally deficient\u201d.

The result was that when doctors searched using the brand name it failed to show the generic alternative and instead directed them to Gaviscon Advance.

An Australian court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/14/nurofens-maker-admits-misleading-consumers-over-contents-in-painkillers\">ordered Reckitt</a> to pull the drugs from shops.</p>",
  "<p>For more than 50 years the Vatican\u2019s relationship with China has been intractable.

But more than a country, a great culture, with an inexhaustible wisdom,\u201d the pope told Asia Times this year.</p> <p>Since his election in 2013, there have been subtle signs that the relationship between the Vatican and Beijing has warmed. There was <a href=\"http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/08/14/pope_francis_sends_telegram_from_plane_to_china_/1104531\">the telegram Francis sent</a> to President Xi Jinping as his papal plane flew in Chinese airspace on the way to Taiwan in 2014, and the gift of a silk print, symbolic of Christianity\u2019s presence in China, that was reportedly given to the pope this month by a representative of Xi, though the accuracy of that story has not been confirmed.</p> <p>Chinese Catholics are free to go to mass and attend church, but barred from proselytising. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/christian-church-leader-hu-shigen-jailed-chinese-human-rights-crackdown\">\u201cunderground\u201d Catholic church</a> exists, and members and its clergy have faced persecution by authorities.</p> <p>No one believes that negotiations between the two sides will lead to formal diplomatic relations, a move that would force the Vatican to break ties with Taiwan. Jeroom Heyndrickx, a Belgian priest who has championed the negotiations, said the talks were centred on whether the Vatican would be given permission to appoint its own bishops. </p> <p>There is also a disagreement over the the fate of eight \u201cillegal\u201d bishops appointed by officials in China, some of whom have been excommunicated by the Vatican.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere have been some efforts at dialogue in the past, but never so intensive and ongoing and with perseverance on both sides,\u201d Heyndrickx said. \u201cThe situation is more hopeful now than it has been in 65 years.\u201d </p> <p>Reaching an initial agreement on the bishops could make it easier to tackle other issues, such as the fate of the China Catholic Patriotic Association, a state-controlled organisation that controls the church and appoints bishops.</p> <p>Heyndrickx said negotiations between the Vatican and Beijing were set to recommence later this month. A preliminary agreement that was reportedly reached in August would allow the pope to choose bishops from candidates recommended by the CCPA.</p> <p>Church sources have separately told Reuters that China is preparing to ordain at least two new bishops before the end of the year, and these appointments would have the blessing of the Vatican. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.asianews.it/news-en/What-will-2016-bring-the-Church-in-China-36349.html\">most vocal critic</a> against any such deal is Cardinal Joseph Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong and critic of China\u2019s human rights record. \u201cIt is unthinkable to leave the initial proposal in the hands of an atheist government who cannot possibly judge the suitability of a candidate to be a bishop,\u201d he wrote <a href=\"http://www.asianews.it/news-en/What-will-2016-bring-the-Church-in-China-36349.html\">in an article</a> for AsiaNews in September.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/china-arrests-christians-opposed-cross-removals-zhejiang\">China arrests Christians who opposed removals of crosses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The apparent warming of relations between Beijing and Vatican coincides with a controversial \u201ccross-removal\u201d campaign in eastern China.

But the real difficulty in hammering out a deal was not resistance inside the Vatican but rather China\u2019s objections.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that Xi has a strong wing of the party apparatus that says if you give the Christians, and the Catholics in particular, an inch, they are going to take a mile. Ultimately this is about who controls the Catholic community. Is the primary loyalty to the state or the pope?,\u201d Allen said.</p> <p>Successive popes have had an answer to that question: it can be both. \u201cBut the Chinese to date are divided on whether that is true,\u201d Allen said.</p> <p>The difference between the current negotiations and previous talks is Francis himself. The first non-European pope is viewed as less political and more sympathetic to interests outside the US and Europe, experts say.</p> <p>Francesco Sisci, a senior researcher at China Renmin University in Beijing, noted that Francis was the first pope to have his homilies translated in China.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, he is not a superstar, he is not as popular as a rock star, but he is known to the Chinese public and that is very different from other popes, who were totally unknown\u201d Sisci said.<br></p> <p>Richard McGregor, a China expert and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/13/the-party-richard-mcgregor-review\">author of The Party</a>, said it was not clear why agreeing a deal with the Vatican would be a priority for senior officials. \u201cThere are lots of obstacles in the way of a genuine deal. At the same time, they have many other political priorities in the area of managing and keeping a lid on religion, so it is hard to see why China would compromise.\u201d</p> <p>While a deal would be a propaganda coup for Beijing and put pressure on Taiwan, McGregor said there were \u201cfundamental issues of authority\u201d at stake that would make it hard for the Vatican to demand any guarantees on control of the church in the mainland.</p> <p> Pope Francis is said to have a special devotion to Mary, the \u201cundoer of knots\u201d. After brokering a deal that saw the US and Cuba <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/18/us-cuba-deal-a-marriage-18-months-in-the-making-blessed-by-pope-francis\">restore diplomatic relations</a> last year, the pontiff may find a breakthrough with China during the year of mercy a deal worth doing, no matter how big the knot.</p>",

Linda, 42, who has taught for 11 years says she is losing \u00a3100 a month because of the fees her umbrella firm charges. Another supply teacher told us his take-home pay has been \u201cdrastically reduced\u201d.</p> <p>Few people will have heard of umbrella companies, yet critics say they have become the latest way to exploit more than half-a-million temporary workers in the UK, denying them basic employment rights and shifting the employer\u2019s responsibility to pay national insurance contributions (NICs) and pensions.</p> <p>Usually, supply teachers hired under an umbrella arrangement are paid extra, say \u00a3140 a day rather than \u00a3120. But from this they have to pay two lots of NICs \u2013 both the employee\u2019s rate and the 13.8% employer\u2019s rate. The extra pay is also supposed to cover holiday entitlements and pensions, too. What\u2019s more, there are usually admin fees on top.</p> <p>According to teachers\u2019 union NASUWT, almost a third of supply teachers have been forced to join an umbrella company in order to get work from an agency. Patrick Roach, deputy general secretary, said: \u201cWe are finding that more and more supply teachers are being forced into this form of self-employment without any choice.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have found them to be at best unhelpful, and at worst corrupt. It can take weeks, or even months, to be paid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The National Union of Teachers also has \u201cserious reservations\u201d. It says the main concern is \u201cone of principle\u201d adding, \u201cthe high fees charged by agencies and umbrella companies drain funding for education away from schools \u2013 but they still pay supply teachers much less than those directly employed by local authorities and schools. Furthermore, many umbrella companies are based overseas in order to avoid liability for tax on their profits.\u201d</p> <p>All the teachers Guardian Money spoke to would only agree to be quoted on the basis on anonymity, fearing that if identified they may not obtain work.</p> <p>Linda told us she had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about using an umbrella company and having to pay fees for administration she would have done herself. \u201cIf I earn more than \u00a3180 I am charged between \u00a315 and \u00a328 simply for using the agency\u2019s nominated umbrella company,\u201d she said. \u201cOther supply teachers I know are in the same boat. Over four weeks this easily adds up to over a \u00a3100.\u201d</p> <p>Peter said that there was now no choice about whether you were paid by the agency or an umbrella firm. \u201cI have found them to be at best unhelpful and at worst corrupt,\u201d he said. \u201cAs well as having to pay a fee, they cannot be relied upon to pay what you have already earned by prior agreement with the supply teaching agency. It can take weeks or months to be paid. They deduct a large fee and charge the teacher the employer\u2019s NICs.\u201d</p> <p>Another teacher claimed he had been short-changed. \u201cThe rate does not allow for the fact we have to pay employer\u2019s NICs,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the company the agency uses for payment charges \u00a36 per day service charge to employees.\u201d</p> <p>Umbrella companies aren\u2019t just common among supply teachers \u2013 the practice is rampant in the construction industry and is moving into other sectors. When Katherine Petts (not her real name) came to the end of her contract as a pharmaceutical company worker, her employment agency, Hays, offered her a nine-month contract doing a similar job on the same salary. \u201cIt seemed perfect, my salary was \u00a340,000, and I was able to step into the same role.\u201d But then came the sting in the tail \u2013 she was told she either had to join an umbrella company or set up a limited company to get paid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am technically self-employed paying both employer and employee tax. I\u2019m going to have to look for another job</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She decided to opt for the umbrella company. \u201cThe idea of setting up a limited company just seem too onerous,\u201d she said. But within a fortnight she realised that meant she was \u00a375 a week worse off. \u201cThe fee is \u00a322 a week and I also have to pay both employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s NICs. I also chose to take my holiday pay upfront, which you would think would make me better off, but it has not. I\u2019ve also been told I will have to, at some point, join a pension as part of auto-enrolment. That will mean I pay both my own and the employer\u2019s pension contributions.</p> <p>\u201cIn my old role I was temporary staff and paid on the PAYE system. Here I am technically self-employed paying both employer and employee tax, and it sucks. I\u2019m going to have to look for another job \u2013 \u00a375 a week is our food bill and then some.\u201d</p> <p>UCATT, the union which represents construction workers, is leading a fightback, and has described these companies as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ucatt.org.uk/umbrella-company-con-trick\">con-trick</a>\u201d. New government rules in 2014 were designed to tackle the sham of \u201cself-employment\u201d among construction workers in the hope they would be paid on a normal PAYE basis. \u201cInstead, overnight, thousands of construction workers were given no option other than to operate via an umbrella company,\u201d said UCATT. It accuses the industry of \u201cblatant tax dodging\u201d, calculating that for a \u00a3700-per-week construction worker, HMRC picks up more than \u00a3200 in tax when they are directly employed, but less than \u00a3150 when they go through an umbrella company.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80a7ff810e10ab00c2dd0df1c24c8413387715a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80a7ff810e10ab00c2dd0df1c24c8413387715a9/0_9_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Construction workers ona building site\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hit: use of umbrella firms is rampant in construction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The union was behind a motion overwhelmingly passed at this year\u2019s TUC conference to fight the use of umbrella firms. The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cWe have real concerns about the growth in umbrella companies around the UK, which could lead to an avoidance of basic employment rights and tax obligations.</p> <p>\u201cThere are often long supply chains involved and it can be very difficult for workers to enforce their rights and get treated fairly.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Hays said that the way its temporary workers were paid was at an individual\u2019s discretion. \u201cNeither Hays, nor the client, dictates this, nor benefits from one pay arrangement over another. The onus is therefore on the individual to choose the option that is most appropriate for them and to check any companies they decide to work with,\u201d it said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/12/paye-off-payroll-employers-employees-dodging-tax\">PAYE or off-payroll: the employers and employees dodging tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The trade association representing umbrella companies strongly disputes the criticisms. Julia Kermode of the FCSA (the freelancer and contractor services association) cites case studies where supply teachers have been very happy to use umbrella companies \u2013 especially where they may be working in several different schools across the week, possibly through different agencies. Then the umbrella makes payments smoother and more efficient.</p> <p>Kermode says UCATT\u2019s criticisms are based on a misunderstanding about tax. \u201cThere should be an uplift on the rate [when paid via an umbrella company] to take account of the employer\u2019s national insurance,\u201d although she acknowledges that it can\u2019t be guaranteed in each and every case that the worker receives the appropriate uplift.</p> <p>\u201cWhen unions first became aware of umbrella firms they were concerned about the apparent deduction of employers\u2019 NICs from pay. However, this deduction should be factored into calculating the assignment rate, ie, it is in addition to workers\u2019 gross pay. All employers are legally required to pay employees\u2019 NICs, as well as processing employee deductions.</p> <p>\u201cUmbrella firms enable individuals to receive all benefits of employment whilst working on numerous different assignments. Good firms are wholly transparent in their dealings with workers, providing them with a clear contract of employment, all statutory rights and benefits, and transparency in how their pay is calculated.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>You always know an election is near in the US when Democrats and Republicans start to discuss the plight of black Americans. </p> <p>Most of the time, little is said about the high levels of poverty in black communities.

Democrats believe they need a turnout of black voters on par with the numbers reached during the 2008 and 2012 election. Then, more than half of young black voters participated, outpacing their white and Latino peers in the process. More than 92% of them voted for Obama; black millennial support for Clinton peaked at <a href=\"http://genforwardsurvey.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/GenForwardAugust2016Toplines_final-1.pdf\">60%</a> this August. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/milwaukee-wisconsin-segregation-young-black-voters-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58xy9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2815974\"            data-video-name=\"America's most segregated city: the young black voters of Milwaukee \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5805697ee4b005f21833a798\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/18/161017Wisconsinv2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/18/161017Wisconsinv2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11966459&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/milwaukee-wisconsin-segregation-young-black-voters-election-video\">America\u2019s most segregated city: the young black voters of Milwaukee</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>After spending the winter and spring months describing black voters as a \u201cfirewall\u201d against the surging Bernie Sanders campaign, Clinton surrogates now try to explain the reluctance to embrace Clinton as stemming from a lack of information about her campaign. In other words, if the campaign simply tweaks its messaging or if young black voters would only consult her website, they would see that Clinton has a robust platform to address their concerns. </p> <p>While it is certainly true that Clinton has gone out of her way to use the language of the Black Lives Matter movement and to highlight the unquestioned racism of Donald Trump, she faces three problems that no campaign promise can adequately address. </p> <p>The first problem for the Democrats is the dreadful continuation of police killing black men. </p> <p>The police killings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">came so quickly in September</a> that most people had forgotten that on 15 September, police in Columbus, Ohio, shot and killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/tyre-king-shooting-funeral-columbus-police-officer-bryan-mason\">13-year-old Tyre King</a>. Described as 4ft 11in and 95lb, King was shot three times in the back, according to an autopsy. And in the last several weeks, there have been continued protests in El Cajon in southern California and in Charlotte, North Carolina, in response to two killings. There was also the video-recorded killing of unarmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/terence-crutcher-shooting-not-guilty-plea-betty-shelby\">Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>. </p> <p>Even where police killings of black men and boys do not receive national attention, they reverberate within the neighborhoods and wider communities for days, weeks and months afterward. Indeed, the crisis of police violence was identified by black millennials as their number one concern above all other issues. In a <a href=\"http://blackyouthproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BYP-millenials-report-10-27-15-FINAL.pdf\">poll</a> taken last August, 91% of black and 71% of Latino millennials described \u201cpolice killing of Black people as a serious problem\u201d. Seventy-seven per cent of black millennials said that they or someone they knew had been \u201charassed\u201d by the police. </p> <p>The Democratic party has appeared completely incapable of putting a stop to it.</p> <p>It has now been 19 months since Obama\u2019s commission on policing in the 21st century released its report and offered 58 recommendations for reform. The police have killed more than 1,000 people in that time. Furthermore, for all the publicity that some cases have received, it is more likely than not that the police officers will not even be charged, let alone punished. </p> <p>In the absence of actual reform, Democrats led by Obama seem to stress the need for understanding on both sides \u2013 as if police violence were the product of misunderstanding as opposed to oppression at the hands of an armed appendage of the state. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s platform is more substantive than that, as she calls for spending a billion dollars to better train police, legislation against racial profiling and dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. While one can debate Clinton\u2019s ability to actually follow through on these promises (and whether they would actually produce the kind of accountability the Black Lives Matter movement is demanding), the bigger problem for Clinton is one of credibility. </p> <p>Supporters of Clinton have denounced the perception of her as untrustworthy, calling it ignorance or sexism. It is undeniable that some of the vitriol directed at Clinton has misogynistic undertones, especially when it comes from Trump and his supporters. But to reduce all criticism of Clinton to gender discrimination is both disingenuous and dishonest. </p> <h2>America\u2019s \u2018first black president\u2019?

What has been left out of the happy tale is the way Clinton used poor and working-class black people as political grist to rebuild an electoral coalition of old Reagan Democrats and moderate white Republicans. </p> <p>In 1993, Bill Clinton went to the church where Martin Luther King Jr delivered his last speech before his assassination. Clinton <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/excerpts-from-clinton-s-speech-to-black-ministers.html?pagewanted=allhttp://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/excerpts-from-clinton-s-speech-to-black-ministers.html?pagewanted=allhttp://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/excerpts-from-clinton-s-speech-to-black-ministers.html?pagewanted=all\">said</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[King] would say, \u201cYou did a good job creating a black middle class of people who really are doing well \u2026 You did a good job. You did a good job in opening opportunity.\u201d But he would [also] say, \u201cI fought for freedom \u2026 but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandonment, not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them, as if they don\u2019t amount to anything. I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people. I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandonment.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton had perfected the southern cadence \u2013 in this case, literally speaking as if he were Martin Luther King Jr \u2013 that intimated an insider\u2019s perspective on black life, while clearly communicating to white voters a rejection of the \u201csystemic racism\u201d which Hillary Clinton speaks so much about today. </p> <p>(Of course, these were the words of Bill and not Hillary \u2013 but the painful efforts to parse out where her politics begin and his end are specious. Aside from the fact that Hillary\u2019s comments about \u201csuper predators\u201d aped the sentiment at the core of Bill\u2019s law and order agenda, we can\u2019t ignore how she has cast her years in the White House as part of her vast political experience that makes her more prepared than anyone else to be president.)</p> <p>This skilled blame game continued throughout Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, during which the Democratic party as a whole helped to structure the wider context within which the discussions about crime and welfare reform were taking place. </p> <p>For example, in the aftermath of the Los Angeles Rebellion in 1992, the then candidate Bill Clinton traveled to South Central Los Angeles and diagnosed the roots of the crisis. He <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-03/news/mn-1956_1_los-angeles\">said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p> \u201cPeople \u2026 are looting because they are not part of the system at all any more. They do not share our values, and their children are growing up in a culture alien from ours, without family, without neighborhood, without church, without support.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>As a result, Clinton and the Democratic party of the 1990s played a pivotal role in helping to shift the discussion <em>away</em> from \u201csystemic racism\u201d, as it had been in the 1960s and 1970s, back to a focus on the culture and family structure of African Americans as the root of black inequality. Bill Clinton and his political partner, Hillary, were not passive observers of an ideological attack that posited crime and punishment over government assistance and public welfare; they, in the 1990s context, were its architects. </p> <h2>\u2018Free stuff\u2019 and the anti-capitalist politics Hillary won\u2019t touch </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e838388000f4c20912f60b4dfcaa8cbefc1c83b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e838388000f4c20912f60b4dfcaa8cbefc1c83b/901_162_1463_878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bernie sanders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Young black voters were most attuned to Sanders\u2019 redistributive political agenda.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second problem the Clinton campaign faces is the developing anti-capitalist politics of young voters, especially black millennials. </p> <p>Though Clinton supporters chastised Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign for its poor showing among African Americans, what went without much comment is how well the Sanders campaign did among young black voters. In fact, 44% of black voters aged 18 to 30 voted for Sanders, compared with the 32% of votes that went to Clinton. Sanders, by <a href=\"http://genforwardsurvey.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/GenForwardAugust2016Toplines_final-1.pdf\">comparison</a>, received only 33% of the white youth vote. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, Sanders\u2019 campaign began with little attention paid to racial inequality, but that slowly shifted over its course. Nevertheless, young black voters were most attuned to Sanders\u2019 redistributive political agenda. Polling found that \u201cpoverty and inequality\u201d together were listed as the third most important issue for black millennials. </p> <p>This fits with the growing anti-capitalist sentiment among young people today. According to a Harvard University poll of young adults from ages 18 to 29, 51% said they <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/26/a-majority-of-millennials-now-reject-capitalism-poll-shows/\">did not support capitalism</a>; conversely, 33% said they supported socialism. This is a political awakening that has been developing over the last several years. In the year that the Occupy movement announced its arrival in 2011, a Pew poll found 47% of young people did not support capitalism. </p> <p>Today, that sentiment is deeper than just an anti-capitalist feeling: it is also expressed positively and in support for redistributive social programs. Forty-eight per cent of millennials support health insurance as a \u201cright for all people\u201d. And 47% agree that basic necessities, such as food and shelter, are \u201ca right that the government should provide to those unable to afford them\u201d. Clinton mocked Sanders supporters during the primary fight for wanting \u201cfree stuff\u201d.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-supporters-audio-leak-228997\">leak</a> of remarks Clinton made during a February fundraiser demonstrates her grasp of at least some of the reluctance of millennials to embrace her candidacy: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And on the other side, there\u2019s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we\u2019ve done hasn\u2019t gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don\u2019t know what that means, but it\u2019s something that they deeply feel. Some are new to politics completely. They\u2019re children of the great recession. And they are living in their parents\u2019 basement \u2026 They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don\u2019t see much of a future \u2026 If you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn\u2019t pay a lot, and doesn\u2019t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. </p> </blockquote> <p>For whatever insights Clinton may demonstrate here, there is also a kind of smug undercurrent that links newness to politics with the \u201cnaive\u201d desire for \u201cfree healthcare\u201d and \u201cfree college\u201d. </p> <p>Months later, after a bruising primary with Bernie Sanders, Clinton now supports some aspects of \u201cfree college\u201d. This sudden switch, in addition to contributing to the perception that Clinton will say anything to curry political favor, speaks to the larger disconnect between her campaign and young voters. Young people wonder how it is that a wealthy nation like the US with its 400 billionaires can also be home to 45 million people living in poverty. The young people, like those of the Occupy movement and Black Lives Matter, care less about what is politically realistic and more about what is just. </p> <p>This concern expressed by millennials is not just altruistic, but it is deeply personal. </p> <p>For some black millennials, their lives teeter on the edge of catastrophe. There is breathless reporting of gun violence in Chicago, but outside of the city there is remarkably little said about the conditions within which the violence gestates. Forty-seven per cent of 20- to 24-year-old young black men are unemployed. Among black 16- to 19-year-olds, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-youth-unemployment-urban-league-0126-biz-20160124-story.html\">14%</a> are neither working nor in school. </p> <h2>Candidate Obama was no President Obama</h2> <p>Finally, the main factor in black millennials\u2019 shortage of enthusiasm for Clinton may be the thin portfolio of reform offered by Barack Obama. </p> <p>Obama won in 2008 and 2012 in part because of the historic turnout of young black voters. This was the generation that had politically come of age during the endless wars of the Bush administration; it had witnessed the collective shrug of the federal government in response to the catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina. Black youths also watched as their families were the canaries in the mine shaft of the pending economic meltdown in 2008. The ensuing wave of home foreclosures began to take effect in black communities in 2006 and 2007. </p> <p>This was the context of Obama\u2019s run against Bush in 2008, when Obama jettisoned the cookie-cutter political campaign. </p> <p>He righteously counseled: \u201cChange doesn\u2019t come from Washington \u2026 change comes to Washington.\u201d While on the campaign trail, he made speeches that invoked the legacy of the abolitionist movement against slavery, the labor movement of the 1930s that made unions possible, the gay rights movement and, of course, the civil rights movement. Obama rhetorically tried to situate his campaign among those social movements: underdogs in the grassroots doing the impossible for the good of the nation. </p> <p>But candidate Obama was no President Obama, who quickly distanced himself from the loftiness of his campaign. The rise of Black Lives Matter is, in no small part, a product of his inability or unwillingness to directly and forthrightly address the persistence of racial inequality. The paralysis of the president in the face of racism and injustice was a bitter pill to swallow. </p> <p>Obama has reminded all who would listen that he was not the president of black America, but the president of the US. Even if this disappointment was never measured in opinion polls, today it can be measured in the waning interest of black millennials in the Clinton campaign. It can even be detected in the terse words of Obama, who recently said it would be a \u201cpersonal insult\u201d to him if black voters did not mobilize in big numbers to elect Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>But perhaps it is most clearly borne out in the anger of black millennials, as exemplified in this <a href=\"http://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2014/12/01/dear-mr-president-a-letter-from-tef-poe?page=2\">letter</a> from the St Louis artist and poet Tef Poe, written at the height of the Ferguson uprising:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When an assault rifle is aimed at your face over nothing more than a refusal to move, you don\u2019t feel like the American experience is one that includes you. When the president your generation selected does not condemn these attacks, you suddenly begin to believe that this system is a fraudulent hoax \u2013 and the joke is on you. Racism is very much alive in America, but as a president with so much melanin in his skin, you seem to address it very bashfully \u2026 Now we are organizing against you and members of your party as though we didn\u2019t vote for you to begin with. This saddens me, because we rooted for you. Me and my friends are young. We voted for you because initially you spoke our language. We believed you would be more of an activist than a typical suit-and-tie teleprompter politician. Are you not outraged by the treatment of your own people by law enforcement?

All with a black president at the helm. Under such circumstances, it is a remarkably hollow argument to insist that a vote for Clinton is a vote to be able to continue to organize. </p> <p>The insistence that things will simply get worse under Trump as the motivation to vote for Clinton is to gloss over, if not ignore, the deep and profound ways that young people are already suffering. Yes, life can always get worse, but this narrow fixation ignores the more pressing question: how do things get better? </p> <p>Clinton should pay heed: a growing number of young black people are not settling for the question of \u201cwho will cause the least harm\u201d.

I was born in the 1960s when sex between men was still illegal. The law may have changed in 1967 but attitudes did not, and I experienced homophobia all through childhood. It destroyed my confidence and ideas about myself. There was a real hangover of hate from that appalling law. <br></p> <p>So as a young man I was deeply affected by the fact people were allowed to hate me for being gay. If they could hate me for something I couldn\u2019t change, I decided I would hate them right back. I devoted myself to gay filmmaking, which is what I do now and much of my work is very confrontational. Therefore I think that as well as pardoning gay men who are now dead, many people still living are owed an apology for the impact of anti-gay laws. <br></p> <p>Alan Turing, the gay mathematician who killed himself following his conviction for gross indecency, is an important person to remember but there are lots of other ordinary men who had their lives ruined. The horror and shame continued well into the 1960s and 1970s and it was only really the 1980s when gay men became more visible. It took 20 years for people to realise that it\u2019s not OK to be homophobic. So yes an apology from the government is needed because there were many people let down by these laws. </p> <h2>Kamaal Hussain, 48, from London: \u2018This does nothing to amend the damage done by those convictions\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fd7fc6e51cfa6775690f8b3770045efa01194527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd7fc6e51cfa6775690f8b3770045efa01194527/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Kamaal Hussain\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This should have happened decades ago, but I\u2019m pleased to see it now. Of course it cannot compensate for the years of pain and stigma, let alone the actual bodily harm done through techniques such as chemical castration, which Alan Turing was subjected to, but it\u2019s a half win. <br></p> <p>While it is a step in the right direction, it does no good for those who are already deceased, and lacks the compensation for those who are still living. Homosexual acts between men may have been decriminalised in 1967, but the age of consent was not equalised until the beginning of this century. So it wasn\u2019t lowered to 18 until 1994, and finally 16 in England and Scotland in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_(Amendment)_Act_2000\">2000</a>. There are relatively young men who have been deeply affected by this: put on child abuse registers, carrying around sex offender records, serving time in prison. <br></p> <p>The pardoning of people is a start, but it does nothing to amend the damage done by those convictions. Maybe nothing can. </p> <h2>Tom Katsumi, 36, from London: \u2018It implies that we are helpless and grateful subjects of a forgiving government\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"45437714e6a9aeb6dcedada4a5cb248bd1a1cdf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45437714e6a9aeb6dcedada4a5cb248bd1a1cdf7/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Tom Katsumi\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m a gay man who thinks it\u2019s wrong to issue a pardon. A pardon is forgiveness for an error or offence, the only offence here was by the UK government and so the idea of being \u201cforgiven\u201d by them is highly offensive. After the Conservatives managed to dispel their \u201cnasty party\u201d image through the legalisation of same sex-marriage (despite a majority of them voting against) they seem to be going back to tried-and-tested methods and are using us as pawns once again to distract from their seemingly total destruction of the UK. I don\u2019t have any historic convictions, nor do I know anyone who does, but this ruling affects all gay men \u2013 in that it sets the tone that we are helpless and grateful subjects of a forgiving Tory government.</p> <h2>Emer O\u2019Farrell, 43, from London: \u2018A pardon feels like a gift rather than something that\u2019s necessary\u2019</h2> <p>A pardon feels like it\u2019s a gift rather than a necessity. The message should be that the crime no longer exists and these people are innocent. This would be how I prefer it to be done. It still feels like it\u2019s in the realm of \u2013 \u201cyou have offended, but we forgive you\u201d. It\u2019s strange to offer a pardon when nothing has been done wrong. Pardoning is a problematic word, so maybe the way this has been approached is wrong.</p> <h2>Richard Beresford, 56, from Surrey: \u2018These tiny steps forward are very positive\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cbf76e018d246547ab942e1bd17d93b330452b2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbf76e018d246547ab942e1bd17d93b330452b2c/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Richard Beresford\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>You could argue, what is the point in pardoning people who are dead and buried? What difference does that make? Other than make the nation feel better. I might not be gay but I believe it sends out a positive message. It might be a good way to move forward. Alan Turing was wrongfully punished and a posthumous pardon brings this to people\u2019s attention. It is a more significant move for the people who have a negative perception of homosexuality. It might make them think twice about their prejudice.

Everyone will have their own favourite, but the Joy of Six has a soft spot for Nick Cusack\u2019s goal against Scarborough.

  "<p>One of the funniest scenes in the whole of early Victorian literature comes at the moment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview27\">Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s <em>Cranford </em></a>(1853) when Miss Betty Barker sits down to arrange a tea party for half a dozen of her female friends. Almost immediately it becomes clear that the selection criteria are horribly skewed, and that the proud hostess is driven not by her personal liking for the genteel middle-class ladies who stray beneath her gaze but by the question of their social origins.</p> <p>As a former lady\u2019s maid turned high-class milliner (in which situation she bans farmers\u2019 wives from the shop and confines her attentions to condescending gentlefolk), Miss Barker has a hawk\u2019s eye for social distinctions. It turns out that the tea party is to be patronised by a local potentate named the Honourable Mrs Jamieson, which instantly raises her into a seventh heaven of snobbery. Miss Jenkyns, as a clergyman\u2019s daughter, is a sine qua non. A certain Miss Pole, too, makes the cut, although precedence ordains that Miss Jenkyns (\u201cthe rector\u2019s daughter, Madam\u201d) shall be asked ahead of her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/audiobooks.features\">Rachel Redford reviews Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so Miss Barker winnows on, effortlessly separating patrician corn from arriviste chaff. There is space for the widowed Mrs Forrester, on the grounds that \u201cAlthough her circumstances are changed, Madam, she was born a Tyrrell, and we can never forget her alliance to the Bigges, of Bigelow Hall.\u201d Inevitably a line has to be drawn somewhere, and it is finally scratched in the sand before the ambiguous figure of Mrs Fitz-Adam \u2013 a woman for whom Miss Barker has the greatest respect, she explains, before pronouncing sentence: \u201cI cannot think her fit society for such ladies as Mrs Jamieson and Miss Matilda Jenkyns.\u201d Mrs Fitz-Adam\u2019s crime is to be the daughter of a farmer named Hoggins.</p> <p>The distinguishing mark of Miss Barker\u2019s effort at party planning is how often something very like it recurs in the novels and short fiction of the 1840s and 1850s, whose drawing rooms positively throb to the sound of people calculating, in desperate earnest, whom they will and won\u2019t sit down to supper with. Sometimes the situation is presented in reverse \u2013 seen, that is, from the perspective of those keen to decline the entertainment to which they are so cordially bidden. There is an equally terrific moment, for example, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/11/broadcasting.arts\">Thackeray</a>\u2019s extended short story \u201cA Little Dinner at Timmins\u2019s\u201d (1848), a deathless expos\u00e9 of middle-class social pretensions which owes more than a little to the world of <em>Vanity Fair</em>.</p> <p>Here the rising young barrister Fitzroy Timmins, buoyed by an unexpected windfall and urged on by his ambitious wife, decides to give an evening party in their modest London drawing room with the aim not of giving pleasure to their friends but enhancing their social status. An invitation is sent to the local MP, Mr Topham Sawyer, at which an outraged Mrs Sawyer informs her husband over the breakfast table that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know where things will end\u201d and that \u201cthe most dangerous and insolent revolutionary principles are abroad\u201d. Mr Sawyer concedes that the invitation is \u201cdamned impudence\u201d but counsels acceptance on the grounds that \u201cthey are my constituents and we must go\u201d.</p> <p>The significance of Thackeray\u2019s and Gaskell\u2019s \u2013 and to a certain extent Dickens\u2019s \u2013 dispatches from the front line of middle-class mores lies in how deviously they tamper with the standard notion of snobbery, traditionally conceived as top-down but in their hands much more bottom-up. Early Victorian fiction boasts a fine old cargo of upper-class snobs and status-mongers whose outlook on life largely consists of despising those people beneath them in the pecking order \u2013 think of Dickens\u2019s the Honourable Mrs Skewton, the grand aristocratic dragon of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/23/charles-dickens-favourite-dombey-son\"><em>Dombey and Son</em> </a>(1846), or Thackeray\u2019s Major Pendennis dancing delighted attendance on the Duke of Wellington in the course of his morning stroll.</p> <p>Quite as abundant, though, are the legions of middle-class characters anxious to carve out space for themselves in the worlds through which they move by exaggerating their very slight superiority to the people with whom chance or professional circumstance forces them to associate. Tuft-hunting Mrs Timmins, who christens her son Bungay de Bracy Gashleigh and would prefer it if his name could be spelt \u201cTymmyns\u201d, may never be able to persuade a duchess to set foot in her house, but the knowledge is not enough to prevent her from trying to impress the other barristers\u2019 wives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f80d8864511061f9e8ab6c340a51857f0b7356f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f80d8864511061f9e8ab6c340a51857f0b7356f2/0_0_1583_1099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration from The Diary of a Nobody, which first appeared in Punch in 1892.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration from <em>The Diary of a Nobody</em>, which first appeared in Punch in 1892.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Culture Club/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In focusing their attention onmiddle-class drawing rooms, social aspiration and upward mobility, pasteboard invitation cards and hired butlers, the novelists of the early Victorian period were making an important point about some of the demographic realities of their era. For this, as social historians remind us, was a middle-class age, in which political power had begun its slow migration from the land. The future lay in an emerging bourgeoisie tethered to such up-and-coming professions as law, journalism and the City, and symbols of this transformation could be found in milieux as distinct from each other as Buckingham Palace and Fleet Street.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/09/queen-victoria-tyrant-honest-children-sex\">Queen Victoria</a>, who disapproved of aristocratic excess and could be seen in both her habits and family life to exemplify the advantages of meek domesticity, this new social grouping had a moral symbol, and in the weekly magazine Punch, founded in 1841 and a huge hit with its middle-class readership, they had what amounted to a house journal. Punch might mock middle-class pretensions \u2013 one of its early hits was the novelist Albert Smith\u2019s account of the deeply pretentious Spangle-Lacquer family \u2013 but equally none of its readers would have been in any doubt that the old social order was changing, and that they themselves were a part of the newer and more meritocratic tide that was sweeping it aside.</p> <p>The tradition of minutely particularised middle-class interiors dominated British literature for nearly a century and a half, and can still be seen at work today. One of its abiding characteristics was an ability to colonise entire social landscapes that had previously existed some way beneath its original focus. Most of HG Wells\u2019s early social-realist fiction can be seen as studies in what might be called the search for lower-middle-class identity. They are full of humble characters striving desperately to maintain their social positions and convince themselves of their ascendancy over the people around them \u2013 a struggle that nearly always involves them in a complicated balancing act of disdaining those on the upper rungs of the social ladder while aiming endless volleys of mockery at those who might be supposed to occupy the echelons below.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/13/hg-wells-kipps-classics-review\"><em>Kipps </em>(1905)</a>, the story of Art Kipps, a draper\u2019s apprentice who inherits a fortune and tries to ascend into a new social world, spends countless paragraphs outlining some of the practical consequences of this outlook on life for the lower-middle-class people actually living it. The orphaned hero\u2019s aunt and uncle, in whose care he originally resides, are retired shopkeepers, of whom Wells pointedly remarks that \u201cthey were always very suspicious about their neighbours \u2026 they feared the \u2018low\u2019 and they hated and despised the \u2018stuck up\u2019 and so they \u2018kept themselves to themselves\u2019, according to the English ideal.\u201d</p> <p>The senior Kippses lives are consequently founded on a series of fine social distinctions, so fine that you sometimes feel that it would take an anthropologist to tease out the full extent of their implications. Thus, when their nephew returns from the bitter thraldom of the draper\u2019s shop for his first holiday and enquires about the fate of the Pornick family, whose daughter Ann he secretly loves, it is to be told that \u201cShe\u2019s gone as help to Ashford.\u201d But even the departure of a neighbour\u2019s daughter to domestic service can\u2019t go ungarnished or fail to be pressed into service as a stick to beat what is seen as social pretension. \u201cHelp!\u201d the elder Kipps disparagingly glosses. \u201cSlavey is what we used to call \u2019em, but times are changed.

Walter Bagehot once complained that Thackeray spent far too much of his time in a quest to demonstrate, as he put it, \u201cthat ninth-rate people were 10th-rate\u201d, just as, nearly a century later, John Updike criticised Kingsley Amis\u2019s novels for their \u201cfussy social judgments\u201d. To which one might reply that the greater part of life consists of social judgments, that everyone is, to a greater or lesser degree, a snob, and that what we believe about our position in the world is an essential part of our search for an identity. Mr and Mrs Timmins, Miss Betty Barker and the senior Kippses are all busily burnishing and refining that most vital of existential accessories: the personal myth.</p> <p>If rather fewer class comedies get written in the early 21st century, the explanation can be put down to fracturing demographics. A social scientist recently calculated that, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as \u201cthe middle classes\u201d, merely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/13/social-class-21st-century-mike-savage-review\">a dozen or so socio-economic categories</a> with some kind of affinity to what used to be thought of as the essential tenets of bourgeois life. All this sets those novelists bent on writing amusingly about class the almost insuperable difficulty of establishing their terms, and \u2013 even more problematic, perhaps \u2013 convincing readers of the accuracy of their judgments. The defining mark of the Grossmith brothers\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2014/jun/09/diary-of-a-nobody-pootering-around-on-stage-in-pictures\">Mr Pooter in <em>The Diary of a Nobody</em></a><em> </em>(1892), after all, is that he is \u201cmiddle class\u201d at a time when to be middle class meant something. He is as convinced of the sanctity of his clerical job and his rented house in Holloway as he is of the Earth\u2019s periodic transit around the sun.</p> <p>No modern fictional character could have Mr Pooter\u2019s certainty, his <em>amour propre</em>, or, it might be argued, his particular brand of comic potential. Life is too complex for that, too multi-layered \u2013 and even Mr Pooter, come the <em>Diary</em>\u2019s final stretch, is lamenting the arrival of \u201cnew people\u201d in society who can\u2019t properly be placed or accounted for according to the old yardsticks.</p> <p>But domestic fiction lost something when old-style bourgeois life became too complicated to examine in the round, and the critics (and the readers) who sometimes protest that the trouble with contemporary novels is that they aren\u2019t actually about anything are really only noting the fact that when it bade farewell to fussy social distinctions, the English novel also said goodbye to one of its principal subjects.</p> <p>\u2022 DJ Taylor\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/new-book-of-snobs.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>The New Book of Snobs</em></a> is published by Constable.</p>",

  "<p>Speaking at the Conservative party conference last month Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, set out a vision of Britain as a \u201csoft power superpower\u201d, projecting values through influence, ideas and the power of persuasion.

The symbolic importance of the battle can hardly be over-stated. It was from Mosul that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Isis leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/05/islamic-state-leader-muslims-caliphate-video-abu-bakr-baghdadi\" title=\"\">declared his caliphate</a>.</p> <p>But how the battle for Mosul is won will also matter. Military victory is all but assured. The danger is that it will be secured at the price of mass civilian casualties and an avoidable humanitarian catastrophe \u2013 and that is where judicious use of the UK\u2019s soft power could make a difference.</p> <p>The early warning signs are already visible. As the advance on Mosul has gathered pace, the flow of displaced civilians has mounted. Save the Children staff near Hawija, another battle front some 100 miles south of Mosul, are dealing with young children arriving on the verge of starvation. Many have escaped Hawija, evaded Isis checkpoints and trekked for 36 hours on perilous mountain paths across terrain laced with improvised landmines. The humanitarian response has been hampered by a chronically under-funded appeal that has left reception centres desperately short of food, water and medicines.</p> <p>Far worse could be in store. Much of the civilian population is now concentrated in the old city on the eastern bank of the Tigris. This is the poorest part of Mosul. If Iraqi forces mount an artillery barrage or unleash irregular militias, the scenes from Mosul could mirror the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/aleppo-must-be-cleaned-declares-assad-amid-outcry-over-bloody-siege\" title=\"\">horror of eastern Aleppo</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/2016-10/impending-mosul-assault-puts-600000-children-line-fire\" title=\"\">600,000 children living in the city</a> will inevitably figure prominently in the body count.</p> <p>Escaping Mosul is not easy. Civilians are understandably loth to negotiate Isis roadblocks, and fearful of what may lie on the other side. But once the fighting starts in earnest, people will move. The UN estimates that more than 1 million people could flee the city.</p> <p>This is a predictable humanitarian emergency that could have been planned for in advance. Yet only half of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54506#.WAjTyTYrKuo\" title=\"\">UN\u2019s $284m emergency appeal</a> has been funded \u2013 and the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/iraqi-forces-advance-toward-isis-held-mosul-1476702688\" title=\"\">six camps that have been established</a> are currently equipped to accommodate fewer than 60,000 people. For the purposes of comparison, try imagining the entire population of Birmingham on the move and a humanitarian effort to cater for a population half the size of Sutton Coldfield.</p> <p>So how can the UK exercise soft power in defence of fundamental values such as the protection of children in conflict, upholding humanitarian law and minimising civilian casualties?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In marked contrast to the situation in Aleppo, the UK has both direct and indirect influence in Iraq</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In marked contrast to the situation in Aleppo, the UK has both direct and indirect influence in Iraq. Along with other coalition partners, the UK is extensively involved in training local forces: more than 18,000 Iraqi security forces and peshmerga have been trained to date. Britain\u2019s armed forces are on the ground around Mosul, along with American counterparts, providing advice on tactics \u2013 and the UK is part of an alliance that carries weight with the Iraqi government.</p> <p>Soft-power engagement should start with the clear message that Iraqi commanders on the ground must protect civilians. The mistakes, including the indiscriminate artillery bombardments that led to mass civilian casualties in cities such as Falluja and Ramadi must not be repeated.</p> <p>It is already clear that insufficient preparation has been made for civilian protection. Military commanders have used radio broadcasts to instruct families and children trapped in Mosul to stay inside and put white flags on their homes. At best this will be ineffective. At worst it will turn civilians into identifiable human shields. This is downright unacceptable.</p> <p>One of the most urgent priorities now is for military commanders to identify, open and maintain safe humanitarian routes in and out of Mosul as troops advance. Both regular military and irregular forces need to understand that failure to protect humanitarian access is a violation of the Geneva conventions \u2013 and a war crime.</p> <p>But facilitating safe exit is just part of the equation. The UK should now launch a major international initiative aimed at closing the financing gap for humanitarian provision. My colleagues in Save the Children will be administering one of the camps. But our preparations, like those of other humanitarian agencies, have been hampered by chronic funding deficits. Make no mistake: failure to close these deficits will hurt children who have suffered enough and surely have the right to expect our best effort.</p> <p>Mosul is more than a test of military strength. In a region where the bottom line of what is acceptable in armed conflict has been lowered to the point of disappearance, it is a chance to reassert international human rights. And for the UK, Mosul is an opportunity to demonstrate that soft power can be effectively deployed in the defence of children whose lives are on the line. If there is a better cause, I cannot think of one.</p>",
  "<p>Barring fog, storms or runway protests at London City airport, this morning we will fly from London to the Isle of Man to become the first heterosexual couple living in the UK to enter into a civil partnership in the British Isles. Unfortunately this option is not open to us in the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/14/heterosexual-couple-are-first-in-britain-to-become-civil-partners\">First heterosexual civil partnership in British Isles celebrated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Isle of Man is a crown dependency but not actually in the UK, so can make its own laws. And this new law is one we like. In July, this small island of some 90,000 people, best known for its annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/isle-of-man-tt\" title=\"\">TT motorbike race</a> and snub-tailed cats, zoomed into the lead in the race for social equality.</p> <p>It matched the UK by legalising marriage for same-sex couples, but also changed its laws to allow different-sex couples to formalise their union in civil partnerships.</p> <p>Consider that homosexual activity was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/05/isle-of-man-legalise-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">still illegal in the Isle of Man until the 1990s</a>, and you see how fast has been its path to progressive legislation.</p> <p>As things stand, our civil partnership will not be recognised on mainland Britain. But it\u2019s a start. Since the introduction of civil partnerships for same-sex couples in the UK in 2004, we\u2019ve been interested in finding an alternative legal grounding to formalise our long relationship. But like many, we were disappointed to discover that couples in our situation were excluded by law. Even when David Cameron\u2019s government brought in same-sex marriage, it didn\u2019t equalise the law to allow different-sex civil partnership; wedded as the then PM was to the pre-eminence of marriage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c9168791217ddfc5721f27db19cdb03ea9c78ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c9168791217ddfc5721f27db19cdb03ea9c78ab/0_129_1538_923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Loat and Claire Beale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Loat and Claire Beale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This anomaly is being challenged, though.

Their case is that in insisting that civil partners \u201cmust be of the same sex\u201d, the government is in contravention of the Human Rights Act. They are the trailblazers for <a href=\"http://equalcivilpartnerships.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Equal Civil Partnerships</a>, a movement we support, including its fundraising efforts to mount a proper campaign for a change of law in the UK.</p> <p>So when the Isle of Man did what the UK has so far failed to do, we jumped at the chance to take advantage of its more progressive legislation. We made our first trip to the island earlier this month to apply in person.</p> <p>We discovered that if you are UK residents, you are not allowed to just stay on the island the night before your appointment \u2013 but hanging around on the island for eight days while the licence is granted is fine. Maybe the island\u2019s tourist office will be offering eight-day \u201call-inclusive\u201d civil partnership holidays soon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With two children, a mortgage, and 24 years together, we feel we\u2019ve worked out how to be a \u2018happily unmarried' couple</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Apart from that, and the hassle of finding a paper-based proof of our address in an age of digital banking, applying was straightforward. Happily the sun shone, the air was fresh and we found the Manx people to be warm and friendly. With stage one complete, we\u2019re now setting out to complete stage two: the official legal undertaking, which involves a simple ceremony and form-signing in the registry in Douglas.</p> <p>But why not just get married? Why should we? After all, with two children aged over 10, a dog, a mortgage, 24 years of living together and dozens of rows, we feel we\u2019ve pretty much worked out how to be a \u201chappily unmarried\u201d couple, and we don\u2019t see why we need to fall in with an archaic institution to validate our relationship. We aren\u2019t acting on impulse or a whim.

This statelessness exacerbates their vulnerability. They are vulnerable to trafficking, child labour and sexual exploitation. Their statelessless also makes the process of accessing social protection systems almost impossible at times, and they become invisible in the shadows of our society. </p> <p>Simply placing two children in each local authority throughout England and Wales is a bureaucratic decision that fails the test of meeting needs, managing risk, and balancing competing human rights. In this sense, it fails to assess children\u2019s need for relationships or take into account the relationships they may have already built. </p> <p>There is a significant amount of research from around the world, and solutions from other countries, which demonstrate what works and what adds to the harm they\u2019ve already experienced.</p> <p>The children do not come from one homogeneous group but from different cultures and traditions and speak different languages. They are without their families, and isolation is a huge emotional and psychological part of their recent experience. </p> <p>They may, or may not have, made peer relationships that have substituted for family relationships. They have been living in unhealthy, dangerous, unhygienic camps and have survived. They will have encountered some trustworthy adults but may have been abused or harmed by others.</p> <p>Many countries have been significantly more active in meeting the needs of these children than has the UK. For example, Germany, Greece and Thailand have set up reception centres for six to eight young people at a time to provide safety, security and stability for a period to help with their adjustment to a different culture, climate and language. This provides them some space for recovery. </p> <p>Other counties have also done research into what works, much of which points to combating isolation and the importance of peer relationships. Peer relationships are formed more often before relationships with adults \u2013 mixed messages from adults seen as \u201cin control\u201d perpetuate confusion and mistrust. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/aug/23/child-migrants-denied-essential-services\">EU states are denying child migrants essential services</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know that relationships are key to recovery and achieving positive change.

There is also a plethora of networks for practical cooperation that have been built up over the past 40 years.</p> <p>Last month in Ware, Hertfordshire, I saw lifesaving asthma inhalers rolling off the production line.

Just as we will need to agree new relationships for sharing information for security, counter-terror and defence post-Brexit, so we should consider whether we wish to retain links to market networks and which ones. Practical consideration on issues such as this will enable both the UK and other EU countries to identify areas where it is mutually beneficial for cooperation to continue.</p> <p>Politicians across the world have worked for years to tear down barriers to trade but we now risk tipping into a new era fuelled by protectionism. Public support for trade agreements will not be regained if politicians focus only on the small minority of elite consumers who shop across borders. The vast majority of people consume in their local area. Decisions on what a new relationship between the UK and EU should be or what trade agreements we should make with other parts of the world need to be made from the viewpoint of the ordinary consumer.</p> <p>Having free movement of goods across the single market has on the whole given consumers greater choice, greater diversity and lower prices \u2013 despite the propensity for the European political left to add extra costs into the supply chain or ban certain products.</p> <p>Import prices matter to consumers, and trade deals with other parts of the world will bring new opportunities in the longer term, but currently more than 50% of the products that we import into the UK come from other EU countries. If we have to rely on a World Trade Organisation backstop for these products, then British consumer products will face expensive tariffs, especially on food, and negotiating a new free-trade agreement with Brussels to rectify this could take many years of uncertainty.</p> <p>So before we walk away from our entire relationship with the single market, it is important to seriously consider strategies to maintain substantial portions of today\u2019s barrier-free trade with the EU. Some politicians in other EU countries may say no to an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d relationship for the UK, but when one examines the EU\u2019s own \u201csingle market scoreboard\u201d on the different approaches that individual countries within the EU sometimes take to implementing single market agreements, it is clear that some of those same countries already take quite an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d approach themselves.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Good morning Gruff. </strong><strong>What did you have for breakfast?</strong></p> <p>Is this a microphone check or a real question?</p> <p><strong>This is a very real question.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a strange one because in most radio interviews people ask you what you had for breakfast to check the microphones. Then usually they keep the answer in because I suppose it\u2019s more interesting than what\u2019s to follow.

I\u2019m on about 20 a day.</p> <p><strong>Bloody hell!</strong></p> <p>I did an experiment with Bunf, the guitarist from Super Furry Animals, during a day of interviews and we decided to drink as much coffee as we could physically take. They were espressos, sometimes doubles, and we got to about 13 each and then found that we just couldn\u2019t physically take any more. It\u2019s strange.</p> <p><strong>Doesn\u2019t coffee do some interesting things to your bowels? (1)</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve no idea. Everything was fine, no sorry tales.

I think there was a movement here in Cardiff a few years ago for a tropical Wales. Graffiti started to appear with a Tropical Wales Now slogan and demands that were quite ambitious. The weather in Wales is quite consistent all year round, like it is in the tropics, it\u2019s just grey and wet and cold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/gruff-rhys-set-fire-to-the-stars-review-indie-hero-turns-jazz-era-soundtracker\">Gruff Rhys: Set Fire to the Stars review \u2013 indie hero turns jazz-era soundtracker</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/gruff-rhys-set-fire-to-the-stars-review-indie-hero-turns-jazz-era-soundtracker\">soundtrack</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/06/set-fire-to-the-stars-review-dylan-thomas-elijah-wood\">Set Fire to the Stars</a> (2) is coming out two years after the film. Why the delay?</strong></p> <p>Lots of very uninteresting logistical circumstances. There\u2019s no real explanation. I did a live concert a year ago when I thought it was going to come out. It doesn\u2019t matter, I don\u2019t feel much pressure. It\u2019s a relief and a joy that\u2019s it finally out. It\u2019s a commissioned work so it\u2019s not a regular solo album where I come up with everything based on internal instincts and my own thoughts. I\u2019m more of a songwriter so I\u2019d imagine someone who buys my records might expect some songs but there\u2019s only three sung songs on this record. But it was very freeing for me. I was able to indulge in 20 instrumentals.</p> <p><strong>The press release mentions \u201cagro-jazz\u201d \u2013 what\u2019s that?</strong></p> <p>At the time I wrote some sleeve notes and I can\u2019t remember if it was agro as in an aggressive take on jazz or what. The word jazz comes with a lot of connotations for me, both good and bad, so I aggressively took jazz on. I only used instruments that were available in the 1950s but beyond that I didn\u2019t try and make specifically 50s music. It\u2019s mainly exercises in what krautrock would sound like played by a jazz band in 1950.</p> <p><strong>The album features the worst instrument on the planet \u2013 the saxophone. (3) What\u2019s your least favourite instrument?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve gone through periods of having problems with the saxophone. I think it was badly used in the 70s in particular. But I\u2019ve worked myself through my phobia.</p> <p><strong>How? Can you give me some advice?</strong></p> <p>Well, just by listening to some records where it\u2019s used properly. Especially deep glam rock where people don\u2019t solo, they make guttural noises with it. Another way would be to go to extremes and embrace the synthetic saxophone. There\u2019s a saxophone-shaped synthesiser that goes into the electronic world. In the right hands it\u2019s potentially a good thing, but it can go either way.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur7_jT-obmc\">I Love EU</a>, your song encouraging people to vote remain, wasn\u2019t enough to change the voting public\u2019s minds. (4) Why do you think people voted to leave? </strong> </p> <p>It was pretty tight. It was a close vote and there was an array of reasons as to why people voted to leave, some justified and a lot completely unjustified and based on xenophobia. I think what would have tipped it into a majority would be, for me, a constant barrage of misinformation by careerist politicians who thought very little of the consequences of the vote for the general public.</p> <p><strong>Do you think if there was another vote now, things would be different?</strong></p> <p>Opinion polls in Wales suggest so. I don\u2019t think the negative impact of the vote will be clear for a while. In terms of the environment and unemployment, I think it\u2019s going to deteriorate in the coming years, especially if we\u2019re still governed by a bunch of climate change deniers and a government that\u2019s willing to let the free market reign with no tax. In the short term, I\u2019ve no idea if the vote would change with the same media around. It\u2019s such an ill-defined vote because nobody knows what Brexit is. I don\u2019t even like the word Brexit. I try not to use it because it\u2019s such a shit word. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/brexit-means-brexit-theresa-may-jonathan-lynn-yes-minister\">Brexit means Brexit</a>, but what is Brexit?</p> <p><strong>Right, no more politics.

Does that sort of thing excite you? Mixing it up with the big pop acts? </strong> </p> <p>I think we had records peak at 11, 12 and 13. <strong>(5)</strong> At the time, when the CD was prevalent \u2013 which was a strange small silver disc that people used to put into machines \u2013 most record companies would make two CD singles of the same song with different B-sides and remixes. It was a scam to make people buy the record twice. The second disc would be full of meaningless remixes so the band wouldn\u2019t actually have to do anything. We felt that was a complete rip-off, so we refused to play those kinds of games. When those records were going to 11 and 12, we felt validated because the people who were in the Top 10 had played those kind of games.</p> <p><strong>So if the charts had been based on principles, you guys would have had No 1 hits?</strong></p> <p>(Laughs) No, we would have been at No 6. On a good day. We were No 1 in the album charts for a few days but then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/10/destinys-child-new-song\">Destiny\u2019s Child</a> came in and took our spot. <strong>(6)</strong> You can\u2019t argue with that, though. We were like, \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Will the Super Furry Animals shows at the end of the year lead to a new album do you think?</strong></p> <p>Not for the time being, no. We\u2019ve been touring again for about three years and we\u2019re going up to Christmas and then we probably won\u2019t do anything for a while. I\u2019m on my way to band practice later. We played a few weekends ago at Liverpool Psych Fest and I think voltage governs how a lot of records sound. Like a record mastered in America with American power will sound different to a record made in Europe, for example. Then you have maverick mastering studios that go off the grid, so they have their own generators powered to full capacity by an insanely powerful voltage. <strong>(7)</strong> Unfortunately at Liverpool Psych Fest we tried to power 400 volts through the bass amp and it blew up in the first song. So we plugged another one in and that blew up. It was quite a dramatic, situationist set with loads of technicians on stage doing live repairs while we played.</p> <p><strong>OK. How do you feel about Facebook?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve never been on Facebook but I have a Facebook account that takes in all my other social media. I only had it put up there because there were a lot of people claiming to be me and having conversations with my friends as me. I felt like it showed a lack of ambition in a way \u2013 why pose as me when you could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>, for example?

Every day you signed on and would be paid cash. I had it a couple of times when a little bloke would come on a motorbike and pick you up to take you to a job.\u201d Thirty-five years later, Johns still looks more like a brickie than a movie star: short, slightly stout, bald as an egg, in a woolly jumper and jeans, with a throaty geordie voice you can imagine yelling at his pals from the scaffolding. There are not many Oscar-tipped actors called Dave, but Johns was tickled earlier this year to be listed, by Variety magazine, as a potential Academy award winner for his part in his debut film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving\">I, Daniel Blake</a>.

As he puts it: \u201cI pissed myself.\u201d</p> <p>For the past 27 years, Johns has been <a href=\"http://davejohns.net\">plugging away on the UK comedy circuit</a>. It didn\u2019t earn him the big bucks, but it kept him out of the jobcentre. There were a few telly appearances, a Never Mind the Buzzcocks here, an 8 Out of 10 Cats there, plus a few stage appearances alongside bigger names, such as his bit part alongside Christian Slater in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/mar/29/theatre\">One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest</a>, when he was hung up on a wall and told to go, \u201cArrgggh.\u201d But, until a year ago, he paid his bills as a jobbing comic, getting heckled at by stags and hens in the small towns of Britain, taking any gig that would keep his mortgage payments up to date.</p> <p>All that looks set to change with the release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jun/15/i-daniel-blake-trailer-ken-loach-palme-dor-winner-video\">I, Daniel Blake</a>, which arrives in cinemas in the UK today with a string of major prizes to its name, including Cannes\u2019 Palme d\u2019Or.

It turned out to be a character in Loach\u2019s latest film, about the benefits system and sanctions regime.</p> <p>After a few auditions with various potential leading ladies, Johns got the part of Daniel Blake, a widowed carpenter who tries to sign on after suffering a massive heart attack that renders him unfit for work. The film charts his attempts to retain his dignity in the face of the callous bureaucracy of the department for work and pensions\u2019 welfare programme, which requires him to not just spend 35 hours a week searching for jobs his doctor has said he is too unwell to take, but also to prove that he has done so \u2013 all with a handwritten CV cobbled together after a mandatory workshop ordered by his \u201cwork coach\u201d at the jobcentre.

There are certainly similarities between Johns and his character.

He recalls an earnest conversation with a man at a Q&amp;A at a film festival, who asked what Johns\u2019 \u201cprocess\u201d was. \u201cHe had trained at the Lee Strasberg school of acting. He said: \u2018I loved the film. What was the process? Did you and Ken Loach, for example, discuss how Daniel would sit?\u2019 And I went: \u2018Er, no, I just sat down on the chair.\u2019 I don\u2019t understand that intellectualising of it. I think [acting] has to come from just raw feeling.\u201d</p> <p>I, Daniel Blake was filmed in chronological sequence and made on location in Newcastle over 10 weeks, with the actors receiving just a few pages of script at a time. If Daniel was going to receive a phone call, that would be all that Johns would know. He would be given a phone, put it to his ear and on the other end would be the fitness-to-work assessor leaving a message. The unfolding drama was shared on a strictly need-to-know basis, so that during what is arguably the film\u2019s most agonising scene, in a real food bank, with real food bank volunteers, even Johns didn\u2019t realise what his co-star, the heartbreakingly brilliant Squires, was going to do \u2013 and ended up gasping with horror, just like many audiences. Another of the most memorable scenes took place in a real mini-mart, remembers Johns. \u201cThey didn\u2019t close it, they didn\u2019t have extras.

He recently spoke at the Labour party conference and is optimistic that the film will prompt audiences into action.

It concludes that social media can level the playing field for disadvantaged candidates. </p> <p>While negative portrayals in traditional media can put women off politics, social media can be a way for female politicians to engage the public on their own terms and become known without relying on journalists or political parties. According to the report, 86% of female politicians use social media. It is low cost, which is good for women because they receive fewer private donations on average than male politicians. It\u2019s also a flexible and time-efficient format for campaigning, allowing women to bypass what the report\u2019s author, Harvard University\u2019s Thomas Patterson, describes as the \u201cmotherhood penalty\u201d. Women with children are as active on social media as those without, he says.</p> <p>British MEP Julie Ward, speaking at the report\u2019s launch said: \u201cWomen have found a space for themselves on social media that they didn\u2019t have on a platform otherwise.\u201d </p> <p>Globally, only 22.8% of national members of parliament are women, and there are still 38 countries in which more than 90% of MPs are men. </p> <p>But women still fail to fully utilise social media, falling short when it comes to using it as a humanising device, not just a broadcasting tool. \u201cAlthough research has found only marginal differences in how female and male leaders use social media, personal postings are an exception,\u201d says the report. While men tend to view messages about their private lives as a way to demonstrate their softer side, women tend to worry such exposure will activate gender stereotypes that counter an image of strong leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/julia-gillard-says-online-abuse-deters-women-from-political-careers\">Julia Gillard says online abuse deters women from political careers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kaja Kallas, an Estonian MEP, says it can be difficult to find the balance of showing a lighter side online without pandering to an entertainment-driven news cycle. \u201cWomen tend to keep themselves from it to show they are serious,\u201d she says. \u201cBut people don\u2019t really like serious topics.\u201d</p> <p>McGuinness is always surprised by what works on social media.

Half of the women surveyed \u2013 regardless of country, background, age, position and party \u2013 had received insults or threats online.</p> <p>McGuinness has a coping strategy.

  "<p>Rushcliffe borough council in Nottinghamshire has introduced spot fines for extreme cases of anti-social behaviour under the public space protection order (PSPO) powers given to councils by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/contents/enacted\">Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014</a>. Reports claimed the council planned to issue \u00a3100 spot fines to homeless people \u2013 the council countered that these fines would be used as a last resort. But the terms under which the council states it will enforce these powers are vague and subjective: while many people will not be affronted by the sight of a rough sleeper on a bench, for others a homeless person bedding down in a park is seen as threatening their use of public space.</p> <p>The use of PSPOs has accurately been described as a form of wide-ranging anti-social behaviour order (asbo) for public behaviour and space. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/08/pspos-new-control-orders-public-spaces-asbos-freedoms\">Author Bradley Garrett points out</a> that while \u201casbos were directed at individuals, PSPOs are geographically defined, making pre-defined activities within a mapped area prosecutable.\u201d No surprise then that the people most often targeted by these new powers, which forbid certain behaviour in designated spaces such as drinking and congregating (or \u201csocialising\u201d as ordinary people might call it), are often the most marginalised and scapegoated in society.</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.hackney.gov.uk/update-on-hackneys-public-space-protection-order\">Hackney council planned to introduce a PSPO</a> with a clause targeting rough sleeping in 2015, and public anger forced a backtrack, although it admitted it would not rule out future PSPOs. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-35153934\">Exeter city council</a> used the powers to confiscate 57 tents from homeless people in the city in 2015. Freedom of Information requests by <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/local-councils-across-england-and-wales-are-criminalising-the-homeless\">Vice magazine earlier in the year</a> revealed 1 in 10 councils are using PSPOs in essence to criminalise homelessness.</p> <p>Homelessness has complex causes, and entrenched homelessness presents particular difficulties: the reasons people sleep on the street are myriad, and many people simply don\u2019t want the help offered to them. The rate of mental health problems reported in the single homeless population is extremely high \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.homeless.org.uk/facts/our-research/homelessness-and-health-research\">80% of homeless people report a mental health problem</a>. Homeless people who refuse help are often those who need more complex outreach, rather than being castigated and threatened with fines. </p> <p>Rushcliffe council\u2019s response to media reporting on its PSPO proposals says: \u201cThe \u00a3100 fixed penalty notice is very much a last resort and would only be given out to people who are acting in an anti-social way, are refusing support and assistance from the council and relevant charities.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take a genius to understand that all people are different, and despite their dehumanising treatment homeless people are too: not everyone will want to accept the outreach offered, and threatening someone in a dire situation with a fine is both cruel and unworkable. Good luck enforcing legal action against a person with no fixed abode, let alone a postal address for a court summons. </p> <p>But amidst this spirit-dampening, boneheaded bureaucratic tide is a sign of hope: each time a council tries this, the public are furious. While local government may treat homeless people as an irritant, a problem to be dealt with that is no less annoying than tackling rising damp in your house or sitting through a root canal procedure at the dentist, their residents are up in arms. </p> <p>The fury is two-fold: that homelessness can still exist, and that homeless people are treated so cruelly, crated off, fined and swept from public view. Seeing people sleeping in shop doorways is uncomfortable, but the answer is not for the police to harry them into shadowed alleyways away from the public gaze but to help them \u2013 and end homelessness. Fining homeless people for being homeless is akin to breaking your friend\u2019s good leg because they\u2019re hopping while the other is in plaster, or setting someone\u2019s car on fire because it\u2019s got a flat tyre. It doesn\u2019t help, and the logic has departed entirely from the Act. Luckily the public don\u2019t have any truck with it, and the groundswell of anger about homelessness can hopefully translate into pressure to end it, for every homeless person, for good.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\">Sign up</a> for your free Guardian Housing network newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you on the last Friday of the month.

  "<p>Whether it be as an athlete, a coach or a member of backroom staff, there is no shortage of career options in sport. But the industry is also one of the most competitive in the world. </p> <p>So if events such as Euro 2016 or the Rio Olympics have inspired you to work in a sector worth <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/business-of-sport/potential-of-sport-20billion-industry/\">\u00a320bn a year in the UK</a> alone, what can you do to stand out from the crowd and score your dream job?<br></p> <p>Three graduates who have gone on to work in elite sport share their top tips for getting into the industry.<br></p> <h2><strong>Explore all aspects of the industry, and stay up to date<br></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8df40ad14ea102cb7e71ca55a1d45f6ec615fcc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8df40ad14ea102cb7e71ca55a1d45f6ec615fcc3/1585_11_593_741/400.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Bromley\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Tom Bromley, 25, studied sport science and personal training at the University of Bedfordshire. He is academy sport specialist for professional football team, MK Dons.</em></p> <p>Elite sport is so broad, it is crucial to understand all of the different areas before choosing one in particular. This is clearly important if you are unsure which area you would like to progress in, but it is also vital for those who may already have a fixed idea of their field. It may uncover opportunities that were not previously obvious, and will be a great help if you ever decide to move into a different area.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-membership\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/getting-a-job-in-sport-how-to-turn-your-passion-into-a-rewarding-career-27630836576\">Getting a job in sport: How to turn your passion into a rewarding career</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This should start with your degree \u2013 if not before. Sports science degrees are notoriously broad in their subject content and as such provide an excellent opportunity to look at all of the different fields. By doing this, I identified and therefore focused on what I found enjoyable but equally challenging, and found a role where I could put what I had learned into practice.<br></p> <h2></h2> <p>The world of sport is developing quickly and you don\u2019t want to be left behind. Again, this starts with your degree, but it is even more important when you have completed your studies. In addition to having a clear grasp of key fundamentals, elements of what you have learned may go out of date very quickly, both in terms of research and best practice.<br></p> <p>You can do this by building the professional aspect of the industry into your day-to-day life. For example, attending relevant events and drawing on the knowledge and expertise of those around you. Also, subscribe to industry magazines such as The Sport &amp; Exercise Scientist, and be sure to read any related national news coverage.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Work with different people, and communicate well<br></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"05522c4c19afe2ada2dea32c7e9786d14d5ea5a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05522c4c19afe2ada2dea32c7e9786d14d5ea5a3/28_3_195_244/195.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Daniels\" width=\"195\" height=\"244\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Barbara Daniels, 51, studied English at Lancaster University, before becoming a national level women\u2019s cricketer and coach. She now works across a number of sports, such as golf, as a coach educator, helping coaches inspire participation and performance.</em></p> <p>Some of the best coaches I have worked with are those who have coached in all sorts of circumstances across the sports spectrum. They are not only focused on working with elite players, even though that may be where they ultimately want to work. As a player one of my most inspiring coaches had a PE teacher\u2019s background and coached a number of different sports. She was as effective working with youngsters as she was with senior international players.<br></p> <p>The creativity and innovation she used in keeping young players interested and enjoying the sport helped us in what can sometimes be quite dull performance environments. She was open to new thinking from outside of cricket and that curiosity and love of finding ways to help people learn and improve have become the foundation of my philosophy as I work with coaches from different sports and cultures.</p> <h2></h2> <p>This sounds simple but is a lifetime\u2019s study. At the top level, working with athletes can be less technically focused and more about understanding them as people. This means spending time listening to what players/athletes really want: what motivates them to develop, which won\u2019t only be about winning; what helps them to deal with failure and success; what gets in the way for them; what knocks their confidence.<br></p> <p>To do this, you have to be genuinely interested in the person before the athlete. It means asking difficult questions and not necessarily knowing all the answers. This is true at all levels and in any walk of life where you are involved in working with people and helping them to develop. So, they are great skills to develop full stop.<br></p> <h2><strong>Build a strong support network, and jump at every opportunity<br></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fb7ad5c7600d05fa3eb436f281d776debda234a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb7ad5c7600d05fa3eb436f281d776debda234a8/331_280_585_731/400.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Ward\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Jonathan Ward, 25, graduated with a degree in physical education from the University of Wolverhampton.

Getting into the elite sport industry is not easy, because it\u2019s so competitive, and it\u2019s likely that you will face some setbacks along the way.</p> <p>For me, injuries derailed my original ambitions to be a football coach, but my friends and family stopped me from getting disheartened. While you might think you have a clear head, it is easy to be caught up in the moment, so getting the objective opinion of others can be really helpful. </p> <p>But it\u2019s one thing to get the advice, you also have to listen and understand. Only this way did I make the right decisions for me and my career. And of course your university lecturers have so much knowledge and experience that you can gain from.</p> <h2></h2> <p>Elite sport is not an industry where you can sit around expecting things to come your way magically. You have to make your own success, by getting out there, meeting people and by putting yourself forward for opportunities. If you are willing to consider stepping out of your comfort zone, benefits are there to be had. For example, I was offered an opportunity to play football out in San Diego.<br></p> <p>Going overseas was a big step, but was actually one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done. It was great to explore a new environment and I learned so much from experiencing how sport is delivered in another country that this really helped to propel my career forward. Sometimes it can be scary to throw yourself into something new, but invariably the benefits will outweigh the risks.<br></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

I note that the Daily Mail is mentioned 14 times and the Daily Telegraph 22. Game of Thrones, The Godfather and The X-Files all feature. Northern Ireland? Not once. The Republic of Ireland? Zilch. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bull's_Other_Island\">John Bull\u2019s Other Island </a>was apparently cut off by a thick mental fog for the duration of the campaign.</p> <p>The careless rapture of England\u2019s identity crisis leaves many of us on the other side of the Irish Sea in a cold rage. Tempers have not been calmed by the patronising vagueness of the reassurances that we shouldn\u2019t worry because everything will be all right. It doesn\u2019t help either that at the back of these reassurances is an assumption among some Brexiteers \u2013 including some of the Unionist leadership in Northern Ireland \u2013 that the Republic of Ireland is not really an independent country, and that it will simply have to follow Britain out of the EU. The suggestion that Ireland will operate UK migration controls at its own ports and airports carries with it the same presumptuous air.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74889cec318c49f67d49985c85fa02af17508ca1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74889cec318c49f67d49985c85fa02af17508ca1/0_107_3245_1947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May and Enda Kenny at a press conference on Brexit in London in July 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May and Enda Kenny at a press conference on Brexit in London in July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But anger is of little use. No one knows better than the Irish the chagrin of having your neighbours adopt a superior tone and tell you to get over your funny historic obsessions \u2013 so Ireland shouldn\u2019t do that to England now. Instead the Irish government has to do the decent thing for all concerned, which is to try to talk its British friends down from the ledge of a hard Brexit, and to talk its European friends out of pushing Britain off that ledge.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the kind of job that one sovereign government would normally undertake in relation to another. But in the current circumstances, what has normal got to do with anything?</p> <p>There are signs now that the vanquished remainers are trying to find a voice. The economic consequences of Brexit are becoming clearer and the ugly tone of the new xenophobia is becoming more repellent to the great British traditions of moderation and tolerance.</p> <p>There is still time between now and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">invocation of article 50</a> in March 2017 to galvanise a common effort across all the polities of these islands to look for a third way between hard Brexit and no Brexit. While both the Brexiteers and the EU leadership are posing this stark choice between extremes, the mutual interest in achieving a more fluent, ambiguous compromise must not be lost.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/brexit-tolerant-brtain-known-northern-ireland-peace\">Brexit has disfigured the tolerant Britain I\u2019ve known | Eimear McBride</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Zealots will find this despicable, and claim that compromises never work. But the fact is that the Irish question was solved (in the medium term at least) by just such a creative fudge. The 1998 Good Friday agreement, which came from the intimate cooperation of the Irish and British governments, is a masterpiece of ambiguity. It replaces hard certainties about identity and constitutional status with an open, contingent and deliberately slippery compromise.</p> <p>It works imperfectly, but it does work \u2013 precisely because multiple identities and political contradictions are what we all have to live with \u2013 in Ireland, Britain and Europe. It is, in this, a fine model for the kind of creative reconciling of opposing impulses that could solve the English question. And remember that it was much harder to achieve than a sensible semi-Brexit may be because it had to be negotiated across a blood-soaked table.</p> <p>The Irish government needs to forget protocol and set itself up explicitly as the champion of a soft, ambiguous and contingent Brexit that leaves open the possibility of a return ticket. Keeping Britain within the single market is a vital Irish national interest, and some of us are arrogant enough to suggest that it might be no less vital for Britain.</p> <p>Before the war of words escalates and positions petrify into irreconcilability, Ireland should make an urgent and coherent effort to plead the virtues of equivocation.

Similarly, private companies typically try to stay quiet about their political interactions with oppressive regimes.

The recommendations include: putting direct pressure on governments to desist from abuses; participating in formal and informal networks that promote collective action; and using \u201corganisational arrangements\u201d such as structured partnerships with charities to ensure support over the long-term. </p> <p>It is imperative that corporations are involved in a \u201clong-running conversation\u201d with civil society organisations about human rights, Pickering emphasises. \u201cIf there\u2019s only a relationship when an issue flares up, then it\u2019s difficult for companies to engage,\u201d he says, adding that a better solution would see companies regularly meeting with NGOs and familiarising themselves with issues.</p> <p>CAF isn\u2019t dewy-eyed; the motivation for business to get involved is far from being purely altruistic. A robust, well-protected civil society is essential to guaranteeing the kind of high political and economic governance standards that businesses need for long-term investment, its report maintains. </p> <p>This \u201cbusiness case\u201d argument is echoed elsewhere.

The company has seen a 75% reduction in bookings to Egypt since 2011, with this year\u2019s figures a 20% drop on the already low booking figures of 2015. \u201cThe question [everyone is asking] is, is Egypt stable? This is why the Luxor flight is good news for the industry as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>At the <a href=\"https://www.sonesta.com/eg/luxor/sonesta-st-george-hotel-luxor\">Sonesta St George</a> in Luxor, once visited by former president Hosni Mubarak, lines of sun loungers await bronzed guests and rows of empty tables fill the restaurants during what should be the start of high season.

They say government pledges to resuscitate the industry to 15 million annual visitors haven\u2019t been backed by logistical or financial help for those actually working on the ground. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t care about tourists,\u201d said Ahmed Ramadan Boghdady, owner of the New Monaliza souvenir stall that sits close to the famed Hatshepsut temple. \u201cYou should care for people whose jobs depend on this \u2013 the guides, those guys selling water. They only care about us once we have money. Civil servants with a monthly wage don\u2019t care about tourists.\u201d</p> <p>For Boghdady, a day of sales used to be E\u00a3600 (\u00a355). Now, it\u2019s barely E\u00a3200 (\u00a318), or sometimes nothing at all. He points at the rows of carved sphinxes, busts of Nefertiti and various pharaohs that line the shop, themselves symbols of Egyptian industry: black granite from Aswan, sparkling white alabaster from Luxor, or stones from Sinai, Sohag and Minya, all carved by local artisans . Boghdady says that tourists spend less, now that a holiday to Egypt can be done on a smaller budget. \u201cYesterday, there was a bus full of tourists here, a big bus of 400 people. They spent [only] E\u00a3245 (\u00a322.50)! Eighty per cent of my artists aren\u2019t working \u2013 look at how many pieces we have here!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cLook, the rows are three deep; before it was one!\u201d</p> <p>For its part, Egypt\u2019s government has worked to reopen attractions such as the tombs of King Seti and Queen Nefertari earlier this year, as well as four tombs used to bury royal butlers which reopened in late 2015, but adding to the rich array of attractions has done little to get visitor numbers back to their previous highs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9a4a6b41a88e3c05045248f1c0031dadf046ff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9a4a6b41a88e3c05045248f1c0031dadf046ff1/0_55_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Areeka caf\u00e9, Luxor.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Areeka caf\u00e9, Luxor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Areeka caf\u00e9</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The economic ripples of this decline reach far beyond the well-known tourist spots. On Luxor\u2019s main Television Street downtown, rows of shoe and clothes shops stand to attention under fluorescent lights, but no one is buying. The Areeka cafe on Television Street could seat up to 100 people, who come to sip ice-cold fruit juice or puff on a shisha pipe, but there are few tables taken. Owner Emad El Nubi says \u201cthere is no comparison\u201d between a good day\u2019s business today and pre-2011.</p> <p>\u201cEverything slowed down. We have no income. Prices have gone up,\u201d he said. El Nubi\u2019s family has also been forced to close their business producing rice, honey and sugar because of a lack of hard currency. The low number of tourists has sent Egypt\u2019s economy on a continued downward spiral, even as the government insists that mega-projects, such as the second Suez Canal channel, would reverse the country\u2019s fortunes. Egypt recently accepted a $12bn loan from the IMF, requiring it to slice further into subsidies and, in all likelihood, devalue its currency for a second time in a year. The result has been price hikes for basic goods and services, not to mention the sudden introduction of VAT, that have hit ordinary Egyptians in the pocket from Aswan to Alexandria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"448517f35e5ed4f573f1eb4c1875592167799811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/448517f35e5ed4f573f1eb4c1875592167799811/0_31_507_304/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ramses VI\u2019s tomb in the Valley of the Kings.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramses VI\u2019s tomb in the Valley of the Kings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kenneth Garrett/Getty Images/National Geographic Creative</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reduced numbers of tourists also mean a lack of funds. \u201cPer day, we get maybe 20 people now,\u201d said Samia Abdel Aziz, head of the Luxor Museum. The museum recently increased ticket prices to the equivalent of E\u00a3100 (\u00a39) from E\u00a380 (\u00a37.40), and added a special E\u00a350 (\u00a34.50) ticket for taking photos, without flash, of the exhibits. The revenue from ticket sales from the museum, as well as other historical sites around the country, are pooled and fed back to the Ministry of Antiquities, which maintains a separate budget from the rest of the government, funded in large part by these ticket sales. But decreased sales means less money for projects like the long-awaited Grand Egyptian Museum near Cairo, designed to draw in new visitors once it opens in 2018.</p> <p>A drop in visitor numbers is also tied to security. At the Karnak temple, an Egyptian guide gestures to a statue of Ramses II and his wife Nefertari as he conducts a tour in fluent Mandarin, while another leads a group in Russian. There is no shortage of trained guides, but safety remains a concern \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/egyptian-tourist-city-of-luxor-hit-by-suicide-bomb-attack\">Karnak witnessed a rare but troubling attack by a suicide bomber and two gunmen</a> in June last year.

When a burly American tourist with a GoPro strapped to his head and a camera atop a selfie-stick boards the train to the Hatshepsut temple, Ibrahim laughs with him and adds he should tell all his friends to come to Egypt. \u201cTell them yourself,\u201d he replies, pointing his camera at Ibrahim. \u201cPlease, please come to Egypt, we are waiting for you!\u201d Ibrahim jokingly pleads.</p> <p>But perhaps the solution to Egypt\u2019s tourism woes lies elsewhere. At the tomb of Horemheb, a ruler known for bringing stability back to the country, visitor Vinod Ramanathan from India said Egypt could easily become a top destination for Indians. \u201cIndians want to travel, as we have more disposable income now, and this is the place for that,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to know about this country, and they don\u2019t right now ... you could have many Indians travelling here.\u201d</p> <h2>Other destinations in Egypt</h2> <h2>CAIRO</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba2ea6dce77b92fa424ef8c13112e1077daeb6a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba2ea6dce77b92fa424ef8c13112e1077daeb6a4/0_542_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bar at the Windsor Hotel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bar at the Windsor Hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cairo has never had any shortage of hotel rooms, and large hotel chains have continued a steady, if depreciated, flow of business since 2011, mostly from visitors from the Gulf.

The recent addition of the <a href=\"http://www.coworkinn-dahab.com/\">CoworkInn</a> to Dahab\u2019s collection of cafes and bars is designed to bring back both Egyptian and foreign travellers who feel like working by the beach. Even so, the FCO continues to advise against \u201call but essential travel\u201d to the two towns, in part because they are closer to North Sinai, which has witnessed a spike in activity since 2013 from Sinai Province, a group now affiliated with Isis. </p> <p>Along the Red Sea coast, the town of Hurghada was previously popular with Russian, British and German visitors. A report by Capmas found that Russian visits to Egypt were down 60%, British 17.5% and German visits by 10.4% in July this year, compared to 2015. But Hurghada has begun to host many of the foreign visitors put off by travel to Sinai while, further north, the towns of Ain Sokhna and Gouna are increasingly visited by Egyptians looking for a break.</p>",

Now it\u2019s at 36m.</p> <p>Earlier this year Jones snagged a rare interview with the conservative blogger Matt Drudge. Jones and Drudge expressed mutual admiration. </p> <p>Drudge\u2019s news and opinion aggregator website, the Drudge Report, is a genuine web phenomenon and considered hugely influential.</p> <p>With about 1.37bn page views a month, the Drudge Report is the second-ranked media site in the United States \u2014 600m views behind msn.com but 300m ahead of Google\u2019s news page. </p> <p>The Drudge Report also tends to link to news items that disparage any action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>There\u2019s now a whole media ecosystem that climate science denialism can exist inside, where there\u2019s little scrutiny of the views of deniers. US-based sites like the Drudge Report, Infowars, Breitbart and Daily Caller are part of that ecosystem.</p> <p>As the Guardian\u2019s Roy Greenslade notes, Breitbart \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/aug/30/breitbart-takes-centre-stage-as-donald-trump-embraces-the-alt-right\">has the dubious honour of challenging Fox News\u2019s status</a> as America\u2019s most influential conservative media outlet\u201d.</p> <p>Not only is the outlet having influence, but its executive chairman, Stephen Bannon, is running Trump\u2019s campaign. </p> <p>Breitbart too is growing its audience, according to those <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/blog/us-media-publishers-august-2016\">SimilarWeb</a> statistics.

These viewers watched 11.8 million minutes of content, the equivalent to 22 years of view time, which illustrates the strength of the event\u2019s reach. There were 1.3 million comments made about the event, which garnered over 8 million post engagements making it one of the largest debate discussions on the internet.</p> <p>The enormous groundswell of support for Mr. Trump spurred an impressive fundraising effort as well, generating $9 million in contributions from an excess of 150 thousand donors.</p> <p>Mr. Trump has said many times that this is not a campaign, it\u2019s a movement. That is evident in the size of the crowds our campaign rallies attract, and also in the unprecedented level of engagement sparked by Mr. Trump\u2019s social media activity. According to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity, more than 96 percent of presidential campaign contributions made by members of the media have gone to Hillary Clinton.

Rudd v Gillard was exactly what it looked like \u2013 a simple, brutal wrestle for power.</p> <p>The Coalition\u2019s power struggle is between a conservative prime minister, who believes he has unfinished business and won\u2019t leave the parliament, and a moderate prime minister, with diminished internal authority, who regularly has to sublimate his own views to cultivate some kind of internal stability and esprit de corps in order to manage a parliament with a one-seat majority.</p> <p>That\u2019s a highly complex set of factors.</p> <p>Abbott v Turnbull is not just politicians being politicians \u2013 two testosterone-fuelled bulls stomping in a paddock \u2013 this is an identity struggle, and a multi-pronged one. Even as the Turnbull government exhibits signs of getting its act together organisationally, and practically \u2013 it remains riven by factional differences and philosophical ones.</p> <p>One sensible and measured government MP who watched on in horror in the chamber during Thursday\u2019s events later told me the dynamic could escalate into a complete split, \u201cconservatives against liberals, where absolute chaos reigns\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind Tony Abbott being thrown under a bus,\u201d the MP said to me afterwards, quoting the locution Bill Shorten had used with delight in parliament on Thursday, \u201cthe government was thrown under the bus.\u201d</p> <p>Other senior players close to the prime minister are adamant that a line had to be drawn. Abbott had left Turnbull with absolutely no choice, given that he had indulged in a series of deliberate provocations for the best part of a fortnight.</p> <p>A range of government sources, including people not unsympathetic to Abbott, say the former prime minister did himself absolutely no favours with his sorties this week. They said if he continued to escalate he would isolate himself from fellow travellers, particularly younger conservatives.</p> <p>Senior players say that Abbott, during a discussion with Peter Dutton on Thursday morning, was told there was evidence contradicting his public statements, made both to Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/senate-negotiations-abbott-and-labor-put-gun-control-pressure-on-turnbull\">on Tuesday night</a> and to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/19/australia-avoided-mass-casualty-tony-abbott-malcolm-turnbull\">ABC on Wednesday night</a>, that neither he nor his office had authorised a deal with the Liberal Democratic party senator David Leyonhjelm to put a sunset clause on an import ban on the Adler lever-action shotgun.</p> <p>This version of events has Abbott agreeing during the conversation with Dutton to issue a clarifying statement before question time \u2013 then reneging on that undertaking. A clarifying statement before question time would have avoided Thursday\u2019s direct confrontation in the chamber.</p> <p>But people closer to Abbott say he declined to issue a statement during the meeting with Dutton, arguing that would only inflame the situation.</p> <p>In any case, the intricacies of Thursday don\u2019t matter as much as the underlying condition, which will now roll into the coming weekend and beyond.</p> <p>The philosophical and factional standoff between the right and the moderates has manifested itself in Sydney \u2013 the home of our duelling prime ministers \u2013 in a fight over democratisation.</p> <p>For the past two weeks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/19/tony-abbott-says-nsw-liberal-party-reforms-could-yet-fall-victim-to-stitch-up\">Abbott has been baiting Turnbull</a> over his commitment to party reform, attempting to strand Turnbull between his factional fellow travellers, the moderates, and a bunch of party heavyweights, from John Howard down, who are intent on winding back the power of moderate factional players and lobbyists.</p> <p>People in the party reform camp have been worried that Abbott\u2019s politicking, which has presented rightly or wrongly as a proxy war with Turnbull, has risked derailing the substantive push.</p> <p>On Friday, before a state council meeting on Saturday, Turnbull \u2013 backed by Mike Baird \u2013 made it clear he would not go as far as Abbott wanted him to go on opening preselections to party members, at least not immediately, and not in isolation from other changes at the organisational level.</p> <p>Abbott\u2019s initial response to the Turnbull/Baird position was more positive than he\u2019d been during the week, superficially at least. Picking an overt fight, after the week just gone, would be incendiary behaviour. But this particular fight is a long way from being over. Given that this issue will now go to a party convention for resolution, all the positioning and proxying will roll on. </p> <p>There\u2019s an irony in all this too. It was completely overshadowed during a high-octane parliamentary week but the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, was also battling internal ructions in his home patch in Victoria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/16/the-conroy-conundrum-enforcers-departure-leaves-bill-shorten-exposed\">The Conroy conundrum: enforcer's departure leaves Bill Shorten exposed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the past week two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/19/bill-shorten-forced-to-clarify-support-for-colleagues-as-labors-factional-row-continues\">serious things happened to Shorten</a>. He was visited by a deputation of leftwingers demanding he intervene in Victoria to stop institutional friends of the leader threatening people\u2019s preselections, including those of two female shadow cabinet members.</p> <p>Anthony Albanese also shirtfronted him, delicately but comprehensively, over the leader\u2019s unfathomable decision to back a Senate candidate to replace Stephen Conroy who is already generating considerable controversy.</p> <p>Shorten is in a spot of bother at the moment by any objective measure, bother that could escalate from its current scale of inconvenient to a one you could characterise as downright troublesome.</p> <p>Anyone notice?</p>",
