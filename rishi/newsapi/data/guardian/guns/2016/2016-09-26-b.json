  "<p>The UK must not water down its environmental laws as it leaves the European Union, one of the government\u2019s most senior advisers on climate change has warned.</p> <p>Lord Krebs, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change\u2019s (CCC) adaptation committee, told the Guardian: \u201cIt will be absolutely crucial that governments in the UK replace European legislation and don\u2019t see this as an opportunity to say we can now have dirtier vehicles or less efficient household appliances.\u201d</p> <p>Krebs said EU regulation played an essential part in setting industrial pollution, energy use and air quality standards in the UK, and also on habitat protection, biodiversity and marine conservation \u2013 areas controlled by the UK and devolved governments. </p> <p>\u201cIt is really, really important that we replace that legislation,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The peer, a former head of the Food Standards Agency, is to tell Scottish ministers on Tuesday their efforts to prepare for the potentially severe impacts of global warming are being undermined by poor monitoring and weak delivery timetables. </p> <p>He said his experts found there was insufficient evidence to say whether Scotland\u2019s vulnerability to global warming was decreasing or not when they reviewed the Scottish climate change adaptation programme. </p> <p>In a detailed <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017/national-summaries/scotland/\">climate change risk assessment</a> for the UK released in July, the CCC said Scotland was already experiencing the first signs of climatic change, and faced huge risks if manmade warming continued, particularly to infrastructure, farming and housing. </p> <p>It said annual rainfall had increased 13% since the early 20th century, while sea levels at Aberdeen had increased by about 15cm in the last century. Maximum temperatures had already increased by 1C, cutting average snow cover in the central Highlands. </p> <p>Under a high-impact scenario, it said, summer temperatures in Edinburgh could rise by 4.4C by 2060, and five-day rainfall levels increase in the city by nearly 25% to 78.4mm. </p> <p>As well as altering habitats, often to the benefit of farming, that would increase risks of severe flash floods of the type that devastated north-east Scotland earlier this year but also introduce damaging droughts in farming areas \u2013 currently a rare occurrence in Scotland.</p> <p>Data published separately on Monday found that greenhouse gas emissions from Scottish industry had fallen again last year, by 10% for a group of six gases. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency said that brought overall emissions down by 34% since 2007.</p> <p>The CCC\u2019s analysis of the <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2014/05/4669\">Scottish climate change adaptation programme</a>, published on Tuesday, found that 109 of its 148 policies and proposals for improving resilience had no timescale for delivery, even though ministers said they were \u201con track\u201d. Another 11 had been revised or delayed, and there was no information on another eight. It said good progress on adapting key target areas was only being made in two out of 28 target areas: roads and railways, and in energy distribution. </p> <p>Scottish planners and ministers were given a red mark for failing to deal with flood plain developments and for failing to make progress on soils and agriculture; there was an urgent need to address this. In 12 areas there was no information or monitoring, including emergency planning, healthcare, recovery from extreme weather and building on flood plains. </p> <p>There was still no clear strategy on coastal erosion, damage to biodiversity from warming rivers and lochs and the potential for disruption to telecommunications and digital infrastructure, despite those being raised by the committee nearly five years ago.</p> <p>Krebs will tell MSPs at Holyrood on Tuesday that even though the Scottish strategy was simpler and clearer than the UK government plan for England, a lack of data and target-setting is now a pressing issue. It was too unclear in many cases who was responsible for these policies, he added, despite clear leadership on climate from Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister. </p> <p>In many key areas, \u201cwe simply don\u2019t know [if resilience is being improved] because we don\u2019t have the data\u201d, Krebs said.</p> <p>\u201cScotland and England are in a pretty similar place in terms of progress [but] I would say Scotland wants to put a bit more emphasis on collecting information to show what\u2019s actually happening,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Roseanna Cunningham, cabinet secretary for climate change in the Scottish government, said the CCC report had found her government\u2019s adaptation programme was \u201ca positive start in taking steps to prepare\u201d and further improvements were under way. </p> <p>\u201cWe have been developing and improving our adaptation response, for example with new indicators and reporting duties on public bodies and our new national centre for resilience. We will continue to develop our approach and the next adaptation programme, due to be published in 2019, will be based on the best available evidence and the advice and recommendations of the [CCC],\u201d she added.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of Saudis have signed an online petition calling for the government to abolish the country\u2019s guardianship system, which prevents women from engaging in fundamental tasks without the permission of a male relative.</p> <p>\u201cWomen should be treated as a full citizen,\u201d said activist Aziza Al-Yousef who, along with other activists, has been fighting against the guardianship system for a decade.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not only a women\u2019s issue, this is also putting pressure on normal men ... this is not an issue for women only,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/02/saudi-arabian-divorced-women-and-widows-to-get-greater-legal-powers\">Saudi Arabian divorced women and widows to get greater legal powers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under Saudi law, women require the permission of a male guardian to travel, marry, or exit prison and it may be needed to be granted employment or access to healthcare. </p> <p>A guardian is typically a woman\u2019s father or her husband if she is married; a widow may have to seek permission from her son if she has no other men of age in her life. </p> <p>But in recent years, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/saudi-arabia-woman-driving-car-ban\">growing protest movement</a> has sought to end the system. Yousef and other prominent activists started holding workshops and performing studies on the religious validity of the guardianship system five years ago. The campaign picked up steam this summer after Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a blistering report on the system.</p> <p>The report gave birth to a hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/iammyownguardian\">#IAmMyOwnGuardian</a>, which spread awareness on the issue. </p> <p>Hala Aldosari, researcher in women\u2019s health, who wrote the petition and worked on the HRW report, said the hashtag gained support among women of all ages and backgrounds. </p> <p>On the two days leading up to the petition, an estimated 2,500 women sent direct telegrams to the Saudi King\u2019s office imploring him to end the guardianship system. The petition racked up 14,682 signatures after promoting it on Twitter, Aldosari said. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia\u2019s government agreed to abolish the guardianship system twice \u2013 in 2009 and 2013 \u2013 after a review by the United Nation\u2019s Human Rights Council. It instituted some reforms by, for instance, making it easier for women to work, appointing women to the King\u2019s advisory board, and allowing women to vote and run as candidates in municipal elections. However, these reforms had limitations and stopped short of providing women basic rights.</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/05/saudi-arabia-reform-plan-approved-economic-council-vision-2030\">the government outlined its Vision 2030</a>, an economic plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/16/saudi-arabia-reduce-reliance-oil-vision-2030\">reduce the country\u2019s dependency on oil</a>, which called for more involvement of women in the labor market. However, the guardianship system runs counter to that, as some employers require women to submit permission from their guardians. Engaging Saudi women in the economy is vital as they currently outnumber men in higher education and will be key to weaning the country off oil. </p> <p>According to Hamid M Khan, deputy director of The Rule of Law Collaborative at the University of South Carolina, many members of the Saudi royal family are open to the idea of reform but senior clerics in the country \u2013 whose approval would likely be needed to deconstruct the system \u2013 are averse to change. </p> <p>\u201cMany in the royal family \u2013 not all but there is a significant number in the royal family \u2013 actually view this is as a bit exhausting,\u201d Khan said. </p> <p>According to Khan, the law stems from an understanding of the Qu\u2019ran which dictates classes of males which one is forbidden to marry. Some Islamic jurisprudence scholars have made the case that any woman should be accompanied by a guardian when in the presence of any man not on that list. </p> <p>\u201cThis notion of guardianship is not necessarily embedded in the Qur\u2019an but it\u2019s based upon the jurist view that there are certain patriarchal understandings about the necessity of guarding a woman from these men,\u201d Khan explained. Beyond laws dictating marriage contracts, no other Muslim majority country employs guardianship laws similar to Saudi Arabia\u2019s. </p> <p>Yousef said some prominent Saudi clerics have also signed the petition, to indicate their belief that the system is not derived from Islamic law. Aldosari said that many more clerics came out after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/saudi-arabia-women-action-driving-laws\">26 October 2013 movement</a>, where Saudi women pushed for the right to drive. </p> <p>\u201cThey all declared that this is not religion, this is all government rules and it should be changed,\u201d Yousef said. </p>",
  "<p>In what will be portrayed either as a motivational masterstroke or a needless act of compassion, Bubba Watson has been named as a fifth and final vice-captain to the USA Ryder Cup team.</p> <p>Watson was controversially overlooked by Davis Love III for one of his four captain\u2019s playing picks.

When I told the team members and assistant captains last night, we were still in disbelief. What Bubba did really shows how together the US team really is and we are excited to have him.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we started talking about this year\u2019s Ryder Cup, we felt like we needed experience with our assistant captains. We needed some former captain experience and some possible future captain experience.</p> <p>\u201cObviously Bubba rounds that out: major championship experience, Ryder Cup experience, on our side. We\u2019ve got a great mix of guys that think differently.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting on the selection of Moore, who is one of two rookies on the USA team against six for Europe, Love added: \u201cIt was a tough decision. We waited until the last minute to catch a hot player.</p> <p>\u201cRyan obviously, week after week after week after week, was the hottest player since the US PGA Championship, and even before, he\u2019s been the most consistent in all of the statistics; in the top-10 finishes, obviously a win last month. He\u2019s just been right there at the forefront for us.\u201d</p> <p>Love admitted the death of Arnold Palmer, who had a terrific Ryder Cup record among a series of personal triumphs, may bring an emotional element to the home team which he will need to control.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we are all dealing with the loss of a family member, and how is that going to affect both teams over the next few days?\u201d he added. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to settle in a little bit.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times I\u2019m just sitting alone by myself and tear up. So who knows how it\u2019s going to play out for an inspiration, but I think we\u2019re just going to have to deal with it the next couple days. For a lot of us, he was our captain, as well, and will always be \u2018The King\u2019 for us. It\u2019s going to be a different week for both sides, I think.\u201d</p> <p>Darren Clarke, Europe\u2019s captain, agreed. \u201cWhat I was going to say to the players I\u2019m still going to say to the players,\u201d he said. \u201cBut obviously with this passing of The King, it\u2019s a slightly different perspective on the whole thing now. He will be missed. He was a lot of these guys\u2019 [the players] hero as well.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be another great chapter in the history of the Ryder Cup, and certainly one that goes along with honouring Mr Palmer as well.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke unsurprisingly praised McIlroy, who took delivery of the FedEx Cup in addition to the Tour Championship on Sunday evening. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful young man and an unbelievable golfer, so he\u2019s a hugely inspirational figure for our team,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cI feel very lucky that he\u2019s on our European side.\u201d</p>",

Perhaps because of his deference to his former employers \u2013 Dyche continues to be held in very high regard by Watford fans, who appreciate that his 35% win ratio while at the Hornet helm was something of a miracle in unusually testing circumstances \u2013 but more likely simply because they have been pretty well matched in recent years, every one of those four games has been drawn. In fact these teams have drawn five of their last six encounters (a 0-0, a couple of 1-1s, a 2-2 and a 3-3 \u2013 they\u2019ve covered their bases), which is one more draw than they had experienced in all of history before lateish 2011 (not a very long history, but still 29 games\u2019 worth).</p> <p>As for this season, Burnley surprised the world with a 2-0 win over Liverpool back in August, but we\u2019re still not quite sure what that game meant. Were Liverpool displaying a familiar weakness in games they really should be winning? Did Burnley display a widely unexpected top-flight match-readiness? Or was it just a bizarre and inexplicable gag from the footballing gods in a game where the visitors had 80% of the possession, 89.7% of the shots, and 92.3% of the corners? After all, that afternoon apart Liverpool have been excellent, and Burnley a fair way below average. Only time, and games like this one, will tell.</p> <p>Watford have started the season excellently, emerging from an opening five-game burst that looked exceedingly testy \u2013 four of last season\u2019s top six, plus Chelsea \u2013 with seven points and in eighth place before this weekend\u2019s matches (a two-goal victory here would send them seventh). They\u2019ve also been quite good fun, both scoring and conceding in every game. For now they appear good enough only to be beaten by teams that are probably pretty decent (only Arsenal and somewhat fortunate Chelsea in the league so far), while remaining The Kind of Team You Don\u2019t Want to Lose To (Especially At Home). </p> <p>Winning here, though, might suggest an imminent upgrade to Watford\u2019s status. \u201cIt will be very important for them to win against us. Maybe they will be a little bit aggressive towards us and I think it is going to be a difficult away game,\u201d says Walter Mazzarri\u2019s translator. \u201cWe have shown that we can fight against anyone, but the real step forward I want to see is how we will behave against a club like Burnley.\u201d</p> <p>Both sides will be missing key players through either injury or regrettable ancient tweeting. Watford\u2019s Daryl Janmaat, who wasn\u2019t always great in Newcastle\u2019s back four last season but looks a very fine fit in Walter Mazzarri\u2019s preferred back five, has hurt and possibly even fractured a shoulder and will probably be replaced by Nordin Amrabat, who attacks well enough but as Arsenal showed can be a liability in defence. The other wing-back, Jose Holebas, could also miss the game with a muscle strain. Burnley, meanwhile, are without the strikers Ashley Barnes, who is injured, and more importantly last season\u2019s top scorer, Andre Gray, for whom this is the first of a four-game Twitter-related suspension.</p> <p>An evening of thrills, skills and great suspense lies ahead*.

  "<p><a>On Sunday night</a> I interviewed Lyle Shelton, head of the Australian Christian Lobby, on Sky News about same-sex marriage. </p> <p>Just two Christians \u2013 me and Lyle \u2013 having a chat about the role of religion in the public square, and about the nature of marriage, the teachings of Jesus and how we interpret the gospel. Also, we spent a bit of time disagreeing about whether \u201cradical gender ideology\u201d is the inevitable outcome of legalising same-sex marriage. Shelton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsAust/status/779978961849688064\">says it is</a>; I say it is not.</p> <p>The ACL and others who oppose same-sex marriage have seized upon gender theory and programs like Safe Schools and conflated them with marriage equality. It is a gross misrepresentation to say that one is necessarily related to the other, or as Shelton claims, that legalising same-sex marriage may well mean that Safe Schools becomes compulsory in every school in Australia. It is a convenient straw man (person?) argument to introduce doubt and fear. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/26/coalition-and-labor-fail-to-commit-to-marriage-equality-compromise\">Coalition and Labor fail to commit to marriage equality compromise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Frankly, if Malcolm Turnbull and George Brandis wanted to do one thing, just one thing, to help the marriage equality campaigners, it would be to strongly call this argument out for the sham that it is. </p> <p>Shelton and I didn\u2019t change each other\u2019s mind on same-sex marriage. He still opposes it; I still support changing the Marriage Act to allow two people to marry, regardless of gender.</p> <p>But it was an illuminating discussion nonetheless.</p> <p>Firstly, it showed that the opposition some conservative Christian groups have against same-sex marriage is not just opposition to homosexual people accessing marriage, but rather presents one of the last remaining battlegrounds for them to stand against changes that are fundamentally altering the nature of heterosexual marriage.</p> <p>For example, when Shelton argued that the state should not institute in public policy ways to create families where a child is \u201cdeprived\u201d a mother and a father, I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsAust/status/779990550480945152\">asked him </a>about no-fault divorce. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really good question,\u201d he said, going on to explain that while he would never want people to be forced to remain in a marriage that was abusive, he would have preferred that the waiting period for a no-fault divorce had been set at two years so as to give people pause about the decision to end a marriage.</p> <p>Shelton\u2019s argument is that the shift from understanding marriage as a covenant to a contract has undermined the very idea of marriage as an enduring and stable basis for families in society.</p> <p>There is an element of truth to that, if we are honest. But then again, it is folly to think that marriages were more idyllic and society was a better place back in the days when women and children had virtually no rights. </p> <p>But why is denying same-sex people the right to marry going to undermine marriage as a \u201ccovenant\u201d? If anything, granting same-sex couples the right to marry would strengthen marriage as an institution in society. </p> <p>Andrew Sullivan, an American, Christian, homosexual and conservative writer, argues that extending marriage to same-sex couples strengthens the very notion of marriage as the basis for which families form. If these couples can\u2019t access marriage, Sullivan argues, they will form families without marriage, demonstrating to heterosexual couples that cohabitating or civil unions are legitimate alternatives to marriage. </p> <p> When it comes to whether homosexual couples choose to become parents, Shelton raises a range of concerns: that legalising homosexual marriage will lead next to a push to legalise commercial surrogacy, or spur the use of anonymous sperm or egg donors, and \u201cdeny\u201d children the chance to have a mother and a father.</p> <p>When I put to him that infertile heterosexual couples were already pushing for commercial surrogacy, or that we can and have created legal ways to ensure that children created through donor sperm or eggs have the right to know their biological parents, he acknowledged that these changes in how families are created \u2013 heterosexual or homosexual \u2013 have had massive changes to family relationships.</p> <p>And that is what seems to really worry Shelton and those who share his views.</p> <p>I suspect Shelton knows full well that changing the legal definition of marriage isn\u2019t going to suddenly introduce these ideas and technologies. These \u201cother ways\u201d of creating children \u2013 surrogacy, IVF, donors \u2013 are already part of the fabric of heterosexual marriage. They are available to heterosexual couples (married of not) and homosexual couples (married or not). </p> <p>Keeping the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman isn\u2019t going to keep these technological changes at bay. They are already here. Same-sex marriage provides Shelton and others a chance to argue again against a contest they\u2019ve already lost when it comes to heterosexual marriage.</p> <p>We did talk about Jesus. It was quotes at 20 paces: me citing Jesus\u2019 commandment to love one another, and to lay down one\u2019s life for another, or Jesus\u2019 description of his mother and brothers (his family) as not those who were biologically related but those who heard the call of God and responded in love. </p> <p>For Shelton, it was Jesus saying that a man will leave his mother and a woman will leave her home and the two shall become one.</p> <p>Jesus, I said, was a first century man in the Middle East. He had to reflect a certain culture and time. (I mean, if we lived exactly as Jesus did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to enter the church when I was menstruating.) In short, as our understanding of humanity unfolds, so too does our understanding of God and how we are to live as God\u2019s people.</p> <p>For Shelton, Jesus\u2019 rather specific words on marriage carry more weight. That is the nature of theology right there \u2013 attempting as humans to discern what is truthful and important in the gospels. Shelton and I aren\u2019t the first theologians to disagree on how to interpret the gospels, and we won\u2019t be the last.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/would-church-leaders-support-a-populist-vote-on-euthanasia-or-abortion\">Would church leaders support a populist vote on euthanasia or abortion? | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But when I asked him if he accepted that there is a difference between a sacramental understanding of marriage and a legal definition, he demurred. There is, he says, but he believes they are so intrinsically related in our culture and human history that he doesn\u2019t make such a distinction.</p> <p>Lastly, we got on to an area of (sort of) agreement \u2013 religious freedom. Shelton is concerned that the plebiscite legislation does not spell out how religious freedom will be protected, and he wants to see florists and bakers able to refrain from providing services to homosexual weddings based on their religious convictions. </p> <p>I don\u2019t agree with Shelton that our laws should provide such exemptions, but I do agree that the Turnbull government must spell out what it proposes when it comes to religious freedom before asking Australians to take part in a plebiscite, or MPs to vote in parliament. </p> <p>At Guardian Australia\u2019s event <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/mar/31/why-knot-a-spirited-panel-discussion-on-marriage-equality-live\">Marriage Equality: Why Knot?</a>, opposition leader Bill Shorten ruled out supporting the sorts of exemptions Shelton proposes. When I spoke to the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, last week on Sky News, he said he was certain the government would outline soon what it proposed in terms of religious freedom, and would do so before a vote on same-sex marriage. All of us, religious or not, should keep a close eye on them when they do. </p>",

But the moon also has rarer qualities: evidence of abundant liquid water, a rocky core that would have a range of chemicals, and energy generated by tidal heating \u2013 the moon is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one face always toward the gas giant.</p> <p>Should the moon have water, energy and organic chemicals, it could have the basic building blocks that developed into life on Earth. \u201cFor a long time humanity has been wondering whether there is life beyond Earth,\u201d Nasa astrophysicist Paul Hertz said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky enough to live in an era where we can address questions like that scientifically.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a special interest in any place that might possess those characteristics.

The slave owners\u2019 insistence on skin colour as a marker of identity continues to haunt us. Edward Long\u2019s celebrated History of Jamaica, a key text for pro-slavers and racists who believe in the natural and essential differences between black and white, was first published in 1774 and is still in print today.</p> <p>Ideas about racial difference that began with slavery were recalibrated across the centuries to encompass other colonised subjects \u2013 whether Indian, Aboriginal or east Asian. All were defined as racialised others, inferior to white Britons, and this process was central to imperial rule.</p> <p>A British history that told this story of exclusion would help us to understand the present. \u201cThe great force of history,\u201d wrote the African-American activist and writer James Baldwin, \u201ccomes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do.\u201d The structures and practices that underpin black inequality are not new.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/12/british-history-slavery-buried-scale-revealed\">The history of British slave ownership has been buried: now its scale can be revealed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Britain likes to tell a story about itself as a tolerant and inclusive nation, the first to abolish the slave trade and slavery: in essence, of a long slow march from Magna Carta to our contemporary, democratic society. This remains powerful and attempts to challenge or question it are strongly resisted.</p> <p>History, however, provides us with the means to pursue that questioning. Britons need to grasp a history that takes responsibility for the debt \u2013 moral, political and economic \u2013 owed to others, to give us a much stronger understanding of the benefits that we at the imperial centre have reaped. One such example is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/30/slavery-reparations-call-overshadows-david-camerons-visit-to-jamaica\" title=\"\">current campaign by Caribbean nations for reparation</a>, which demands an exploration of the continuities between Atlantic slavery and the present day.</p> <p>My work as a historian has convinced me that ways of thinking about race are the most destructive legacy of Britain\u2019s imperial past. In the wake of the Brexit vote we have witnessed a deeply disturbing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/30/police-report-fivefold-increase-race-hate-crimes-since-brexit-result\" title=\"\">increase in the number of hate crimes</a> committed against Poles, Muslims and racial minorities. Globalisation, with all the losses it has brought for so many, has clearly acted as a trigger for this upsurge of rage and resentment, the wish to \u201ctake back control\u201d and \u201csecure our borders\u201d.</p> <p>The legacy of slavery is the dehumanisation of others and assumptions of white superiority, as well as terrible disparities of wealth and power. These could not be starker than they are today.</p>",

After the taxi driver became his prime suspect in the abduction of O\u2019Callaghan, Fulcher, the senior investigating officer, had ordered that he be arrested. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/19/sian-ocallaghan-murder-detective\">Halliwell refused to say where O\u2019Callaghan was so Fulcher had him taken to a remote hill fort, Barbury Castle, where he met him</a> in person. Fulcher believed O\u2019Callaghan was still alive and wanted to give Halliwell one last chance to come clean. </p> <p>Halliwell agreed to take Fulcher to O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s body \u2013 she was already dead \u2013 and from there led him to a field where he had buried Godden\u2019s body some eight years before. </p> <p>A judge initially ruled that this \u201cconfession\u201d evidence was not admissible in court. There was other evidence linking Halliwell to O\u2019Callaghan and he was to plead guilty to her murder in 2012. But he denied having anything to do with Godden\u2019s death and was only convicted last week following a trial at Bristol crown court. </p> <p>Fulcher insisted he was right to act as he did \u2013 morally but also in law.</p> <p>Of the encounter with Halliwell, he said: \u201cIt was an extraordinary moment. We had a bond formed at Barbury Castle and at Uffington White Horse and Eastleach [respectively where O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s and Godden\u2019s bodies were found].

This means that the normal investigative priorities of securing evidence, arresting an offender and prosecution are relegated.\u201d</p> <p>Fulcher said there had been no Pace-compliant way of getting O\u2019Callaghan back had she been alive \u2013 or of finding Godden\u2019s remains. </p> <p>He added: \u201cIt was a straightforward choice. In Sian\u2019s case, do I try to save her life or don\u2019t I? As far as Becky is concerned, do I find Becky or don\u2019t I? There is no middle ground. I conducted negotiations under the kidnap procedures. What else could I do?

The additional information we have learned about Halliwell\u2019s character during the court case, alongside the facts established regarding his modus operandi, will assist us going forward.</p> <p>\u201cSerious and major crime investigations are a complex aspect of policing. It remains our commitment to keep an open mind and follow the evidence wherever that may take us, so if there are further victims of Halliwell, then our investigation will work tirelessly to bring justice for all those concerned.</p> <p>\u201cTo assist us in this, we strongly discourage speculation as this will cause further distress to families and friends of people who are currently missing across the country, who will clearly be desperate to have news of their loved ones. We would, however, welcome any new information from the public, or indeed, from Halliwell himself.\u201d </p> <p>Elaine Pickford, the mother of Sian O\u2019Callaghan, said on Monday she felt there was too much speculation around Halliwell\u2019s suspected victims. </p> <p>She said: \u201cDespite my belief that there is likely to have been more victims, I personally do not feel it is helpful to either the police or those families to publicly speculate on those victims, scenarios and to presume.\u201d</p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>It has taken 20 years but Frankie Dettori appears to have been forgiven by at least a section of the bookmaking community for his Magnificent Seven at Ascot, when he won every race and redistributed \u00a340m of their wealth among thousands of betting shop punters. Ladbrokes, for whom the veteran jockey now works as an ambassador, hosted a bibulous lunch on Monday in a smart Mayfair restaurant to mark the anniversary this week, bringing along a handful of key witnesses to reminisce between courses.</p> <p>\u201cBookmakers, in the long run, they always win,\u201d Dettori says, taking his seat at the table. \u201cThey were angry with me on the day but I think they\u2019ve made their money back.\u201d</p> <p>It is a rather downbeat way to reflect on one of the very few days in racing history when it seemed anyone really could make a fortune at the game. That was certainly the message taken away by the Ladbrokes PR director, Mike Dillon, who recalls the \u201cweeping and teeth-gnashing\u201d on the following Monday morning as his firm worked out its share of the payout at around \u00a310m. \u201cI remember at the time thinking it would be really good for racing [and betting on racing]. I told them: \u2018Don\u2019t put that in the trading budget, put it in the marketing budget.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt was the chance of a lifetime and the right guy to win those seven races. Had it been Lester \u2018Stoneface\u2019 Piggott who did it, he\u2019d have gone straight into the weighing room, no interviews, maybe smoke a cigar and that would be it. Frankie was brilliant, presented the cheque to every big winner, went on breakfast TV and every news channel known to man.\u201d</p> <p>From this distance, 1996 seems another world. Footage from the day shows the 25-year-old Dettori looking so boyish he surely left school only that week. John Hanmer reveals he and his fellow BBC commentator Sir Peter O\u2019Sullevan sank most of two bottles of champagne before going on air, a very old-school way of approaching a big day. The software that now allows bookmakers to keep a constant eye on their liabilities had yet to be written, so Dillon describes shop managers from all around the country calling in after race five or race six to say: \u201cI\u2019ve got this bet here, it could cost us \u00a3100,000 \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Ladbrokes\u2019 biggest winner on the day, John Bolton, is here, grinning as if he had just banked the \u00a3500,000. A Somerset cattle farmer, he was in London to celebrate his wedding anniversary and grouped Dettori\u2019s rides in various bets that morning because his wife, Mary, liked the Italian. She then went shopping, he went to the track. In those days before mobile phones were in every hand, he had to wait until he got back to Ascot station to call her at their hotel with the news and a question of burning importance. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got that betting slip, haven\u2019t you&#xa0;... ?\u201d</p> <p>Strictly, the Boltons were due \u00a3930,000 but Ladbrokes, in common with other big firms, had a half-million ceiling on shop payouts. The limit, now \u00a31m, exists \u201cto protect us against freak events, acts of God,\u201d said a spokesman for the firm. \u201cAnd in a way, that\u2019s what this was.\u201d</p> <p>Dettori is not widely seen as a modest man but he is certainly inclined to play down his part in achieving those seven successes, describing how he was overtaken by a sense of disbelief as the afternoon progressed. \u201cThe emotions were so high, I felt like a numbness. From race three, I was no more in control of my destiny. The adrenaline, the buzz ... they say you go into a zone, I was definitely in the zone. From races three to five, it was natural instinct and adrenaline took over. You do what you have to do because you\u2019re taught to do it from day one but I was not in control any more. When it came to the sixth, panic sets in.\u201d</p> <p>The panic was because Dettori recognised he could become just the fourth jockey in 320 years of English racing to ride six winners on one card, joining Sir Gordon Richards, Willie Carson and Alec Russell.</p> <p>\u201cI could be one of those guys in this elite group. The great AP&#xa0;McCoy had been trying it every Monday at Newton Abbot and couldn\u2019t do it. I was so close, I got sweaty hands, a dry mouth, really nervous.\u201d</p> <p>As it turned out, Dettori had little to worry about because if he rode one certainty at Ascot that day, Lochangel was it, a top-class sprinter who would win the Nunthorpe two years later. This was her debut success and she hacked up. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy,\u201d he says now. \u201cI\u2019d done something historic. That was me done. After that, I shut up shop. I thought, it can\u2019t get any better than this. I never even thought about seven.\u201d</p> <p>His final mount, Fujiyama Crest, had been friendless at 12-1 in the morning but thanks to the exploits of his jockey, had been hammered down to 2-1 by the \u2018off\u2019. Dettori was carefree, playing to the crowds as he walked out to the paddock for the last time that day and as he cantered to the start. He did not expect to win, adding: \u201cAnd you know what, I didn\u2019t want that race to spoil my day. The reason he won, I didn\u2019t give a shit. I never put a thought into the riding. Just my adrenaline and natural instinct took over. If I\u2019d thought about it, I might have done something different. It just happened.</p> <p>\u201cI keep on meeting people from all walks of life, young people, pensioners, cleaners, taxi drivers, plumbers, that won thousands and thousands. In a small way, I\u2019ve changed their lives and I\u2019m so proud of it. I\u2019ve won every major race in the world, more or less, but I\u2019ll always be remembered for the magnificent seven.\u201d</p> <p>Dettori has enjoyed himself. It has certainly been a better Monday than chasing over to Bath to ride handicappers. \u201cLet\u2019s do this every year. Now ... how do we split the bill?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There are two ways of looking at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/26/john-mcdonnell-10-an-hour-living-wage-plan-labour-conference\">John McDonnell\u2019s speech to the Labour party conference</a>.

He used the \u201cS\u201d word \u2013 socialism \u2013 without embarrassment. He castigated Mike Ashley for the way he treats workers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international\">Sports Direct</a>. He got a standing ovation when he said a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>-led government would repeal the latest Trade Union Act, which puts fresh curbs on the right to strike.</p> <p>There was, though, a slightly hidden subtext to McDonnell\u2019s oration. He talked about productivity. He talked about his desire to ensure that the City of London continued to get access to the single market. He talked about an entrepreneurial state, under which the government would enable business to prosper.</p> <p>None of this was remotely scary, and it was taken seriously by the leaders of the business organisations present in Liverpool. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, thought McDonnell made some good points.</p> <p>As he did. McDonnell\u2019s argument is that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way modern British capitalism works. It invests too little, relies too heavily on low-cost labour, and this has resulted in a unhealthy concentration of wealth.</p> <p>On the debit side, McDonnell\u2019s policy prescription was a bit sketchy. He said a Labour government would borrow an extra \u00a3250bn for investment, but omitted to say whether this would be over one, five, 10 or 20 years. Similarly, the idea of levying the national living wage at \u00a310-plus was not accompanied by a timescale.</p> <p>Ultimately, these things matter. One of the chief negatives for Labour is that voters \u2013 whether justifiably or not \u2013 think the party is too cavalier with taxpayers\u2019 money and tends to think borrowing is the answer to every problem. </p> <p>McDonnell got a rousing reception inside the conference hall, but that\u2019s not the audience he needs to woo if Labour is to win a general election. More work \u2013 a lot more work \u2013 will be needed to flesh out Labour\u2019s programme and make it appear a sensible, pragmatic solution to the UK\u2019s real economic weaknesses.</p>",

Helmets do prevent some head injuries, and these can be very serious even when they are not immediately fatal. On the other hand, they are extremely rare. You would have to cycle tens of thousands of hours in Australia to get an injury requiring medical treatment. More than 10 times as many Americans were shot dead in 2014 as died cycling and, despite the headlines, most Americans are never going to be shot at in their lifetimes. The benefits of cycling can\u2019t be translated into such striking figures but there\u2019s no doubt that regular exercise prolongs and improves life in every way, and cycling is one of the best ways to make gentle exercise a daily routine.</p> <p>If it were true that wearing a helmet was a faff that put people off cycling there would be a finely balanced argument on public health grounds about whether to make it compulsory. But it appears that <a href=\"https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2016/205/2/no-strong-evidence-bicycle-helmet-legislation-deters-cycling\" title=\"\">cycling rates continue to rise</a> even in places where you can be fined for riding without a helmet. This doesn\u2019t, of course, prove that they wouldn\u2019t have risen further in the absence of helmet laws. The benefits of cycling are so obvious now to cyclists that they will put up with a little additional inconvenience to enjoy them. So why shouldn\u2019t they be encouraged to look after themselves? Why should the NHS be forced to bear the costs of avoidable injuries because people are too idle or hurried to take reasonable precautions?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/24/sydney-australia-war-cyclists-fines\">Sydney's 'war on cyclists': 'I got fined $106 for not having a bell'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Risk reduction cannot be the only grounds on which policy is decided.

  "<p>One of British Columbia\u2019s most influential First Nations chiefs has turned down an invitation to participate in a reconciliation ceremony with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their visit to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada\">Canada</a>, describing the symbolic ceremony as a \u201cpublic charade\u201d that papers over the Canadian government\u2019s failure to keep its promises to indigenous peoples.<br></p> <p>The Black Rod ceremony is slated to take place on Monday evening, in a private sitting room at the stately Government House in Victoria. Officials have spent more than a year carefully crafting every moment of the ceremony, which will see Prince William add a carved silver ring to the Black Rod, a ceremonial staff created in 2012 to commemorate the Queen\u2019s diamond jubilee. </p> <p>The staff is currently adorned with three rings, representing the province, Canada and the link to the UK. Prince William is expected to add a fourth ring \u2013 engraved with eagle feathers and a canoe \u2013 that will symbolise First Nations in the province. </p> <p>\u201cReconciliation has to be more than empty symbolic gestures,\u201d said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs in explaining his decision to decline the royal invitation. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/23/william-kate-duke-duchess-cambridge-urged-confront-colonial-wrongs-canada\">William and Kate urged to confront past colonial wrongs in Canada</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He had been asked to hand the ring to Prince William and invite the royal to affix the ring on the Black Rod. Last week he and the chiefs of the 115 First Nations represented by his organisation decided it would not be appropriate to attend or participate in the event. \u201cThe Chiefs-in-Assembly just didn\u2019t feel that it was appropriate to feed into that public illusion that everything is okay.\u201d </p> <p>When the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, swept into government nearly a year ago, there was a sense of great hope within the indigenous community, Phillip said. Amid crushing levels of indigenous poverty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/11/canada-first-nation-suicide-attempts-attawapiskat\">sky-high suicide rates</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/zoe-saldana-film-gone-missing-canada-indigenous-women\">thousands of missing and murdered indigenous women,</a> Trudeau had campaigned on a renewed relationship with Canada\u2019s indigenous peoples. He vowed to repeal legislation that failed to respect aboriginal and treaty rights, committed to closing the wide gap in education funding for indigenous Canadians and pledged to address the lack of clean water and dilapidated, overcrowded housing that plagues many First Nations across Canada, among other promises.</p> <p>\u201cYet that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Phillip. Instead, the Liberal government has repeatedly ignored a ruling by the Canadian human rights tribunal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/canada-discriminated-against-indigenous-children-welfare-services\">found the government was racially discriminating against aboriginal youth</a> by underfunding the welfare system. Its first budget \u2013 billed by the government as making \u201chistoric investments\u201d in indigenous communities \u2013 will not deliver the bulk of the funding until after 2019. \u201cWe\u2019re sick and tired of the lofty, eloquent rhetoric on the part of Prime Minister Trudeau,\u201d said Phillip. </p> <p>A similar situation has played out at the provincial level. \u201cThe British Columbia government has proven to be absolutely adversarial to the rights and interests of First Nation people in the province,\u201d said Phillip, pointing to the province\u2019s efforts to fast-track the Site C hydroelectric dam, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/canada-site-c-hydroelectric-dam-indigenous-rights\">a C$9bn (US $7bn) project that will see an area roughly equivalent to about 5,000 rugby fields flooded</a> in north-east British Columbia. A campaign launched globally by Amnesty International last month calls on the federal and British Columbian governments to withdraw all permits and approvals for Site C, over concerns that the mega-project tramples on the rights of indigenous peoples in northeast British Columbia. </p> <p>Philip said the hypocrisy of taking part in a reconciliation ceremony was laid bare last week as the organisation\u2019s chiefs gathered for their annual general meeting. \u201cThere were tears and gut-wrenching first-hand accounts of the tragedies in our communities. At same time we\u2019re asked to participate in a reconciliation ceremony that for all intents and purposes would suggest there is a very harmonious and robust relationship between the First Nation people and provincial and federal governments,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an illusion. We decided that for us it wasn\u2019t appropriate to participate in such a public charade.\u201d </p> <p>He wasn\u2019t sure if other aboriginal leaders would participate in the event and stressed that the decision was not meant to disrespect anyone. \u201cI apologise for any inconvenience we may have caused with our decision.\u201d </p> <p>The duke and duchess, along with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, arrived in Canada on Saturday. The family will travel British Columbia and the Yukon in a visit dotted with stops at First Nations communities and traditional ceremonies. The visit, said Kensington Palace, \u201cwill help celebrate Canada\u2019s First Nations community, its art and culture\u201d.</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>One of the most extraordinary figures in the history of popular American moviegoing has departed the stage: film director Herschell Gordon Lewis was the \u201cgodfather of gore\u201d and the \u201csultan of splatter\u201d who in the 1960s energetically pushed the envelope of bad taste with low-cost, low-brow schlock-horror exploitation pictures. Lots of blood, lots of screaming, lots of nudity \u2013 and lots of money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc518d35f21b50c0b62d6661e78543ae73822638\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc518d35f21b50c0b62d6661e78543ae73822638/0_0_3488_5194/672.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"672\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But he was more than just this. Lewis was a sort of cross between Ed Wood Jr, Roger Corman, Russ Meyer, Dale Carnegie and maybe even Bernie Madoff. Because as well as being a conveyor-belt of trash movies, Lewis was a formidable and unnervingly driven entrepreneur and compulsive wheeler-dealer who did three years\u2019 jail time in the 1970s for fraud, having conned people through crooked schemes, like a fake car rental company and \u2013 incredibly \u2013 a phoney abortion referral service, and for (nearly) all these services he borrowed money from the bank using as collateral the cinemas of which he claimed to be the un-mortgaged owner. It was a breathtaking and crazy illegality, but nothing dented his almost sociopathic self-belief and work ethic. He cranked out dozens of books on direct marketing and salesmanship and to the end of his life kept his focus on this, producing how-to guides on making money from the web. In fact, he may well have seen in the internet the same kind of wild-west, anything-goes spirit that drove him in his film-making heyday.</p> <p>Lewis came into low-budget movie-making in Chicago from a flourishing career in ad copywriting. After his softcore nudist-camp smutfests like Goldilocks and the Three Bares, Lewis found his true vocation in bargain-basement horror with his pioneering splatter film Blood Feast in 1963, about a cannibalistic caterer who kills women so that he can offer up their cooked remains in horrendous occult rituals. Lewis actually made a sequel in 2002 entitled Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat \u2013 a title which had a kind of horrible genius. John Waters was always a fan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94bbddc422bba83efeb646627d98629552eb8bb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94bbddc422bba83efeb646627d98629552eb8bb5/0_0_1952_2704/722.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"722\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After this, Lewis created A Taste of Blood and The Gruesome Twosome, which cemented his own cult reputation, and he was a master of films which appeared to have been created simply to justify the existence of outrageous titles and delirious posters: The Gore Gore Girls (aka Blood Orgy); Monster A Go-Go; Just for the Hell of It; Bell, Bare and Beautiful; The Ecstasies of Women; Alley Tramp; Sin, Suffer, Repent.</p> <p>After his brush with the law, Lewis turned his hand to direct marketing and his book titles have a very similar gamey spirit to his mould-breaking splatter: Hot Appeals or Burnt Offerings (surely inspired by his masterpiece Blood Feast?), Sales Letters That Sizzle, and Open Me Now.</p> <p>Lewis was a one-off, although perhaps his career is maybe a lesson in the fact that cinema has its origins in hucksterism and the fairground tent. But without Lewis, there would be no Robert Rodriguez, no Quentin Tarantino. Respectable cinema entertainment is Dr Jekyll; Herschell Gordon Lewis was its Mr Hyde.</p>",

As time goes on, it becomes more difficult for people not to be caught up in the dominant culture, because we\u2019re all connected to the internet. When you see people who somehow operate outside that, you\u2019re quite excited by it.\u201d <br></p> <p>However you define it, you\u2019d have a hard time arguing that the artworks in the Gallery of Everything are anything other than incredibly striking: the intricate carvings of Karl Junker \u2013 a man with schizophrenia who spent his life idiosyncratically decorating a house in Lemgo, Germany \u2013 next to the hallucinogenic painting of the New York hustler and fortune teller <a href=\"http://bombmagazine.org/article/902/st-eom\">St EOM</a> and the figurative sculpture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/15/nek-chand\">Nek Chand Saini</a>, who began his career, as Cocker puts it, \u201cnicking off in the middle of the night to build these little figures in secret\u201d but ended it being exhibited all over the world, with his 18-acre sculpture garden in Chandigarh becoming India\u2019s second-most visited tourist site, after the Taj Mahal. </p> <p>Cocker\u2019s interest began while he was a student at Central Saint Martins, when he chanced upon Cardinal\u2019s book about the subject in the library. \u201cAfter three years at an art college, the idea of people who made art from some inner compulsion, rather than wanting to show off, appealed to me.

His work \u2013 paintings in which naive figures jostle for space with idiosyncratically spelled text filled with references to the Bible and popular culture \u2013 and which fill the first room of the new exhibition \u2013 gained a wider audience, largely thanks to the patronage of rock bands. Finster\u2019s fellow Georgia natives REM commissioned him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2011/sep/22/rem-rock-band-split?index=17\">to collaborate on the cover of 1984\u2019s Reckoning</a>, wrote the song Maps and Legends about him and filmed the video for their single Radio Free Europe in <a href=\"http://paradisegardenfoundation.org/\">Paradise Gardens</a>, a sculpture park Finster created near the city of Summerville that contains more than 46,000 pieces of art. He also painted the cover for Talking Heads\u2019 1985 album Little Creatures. \u201cI think there\u2019s an affinity between rock musicians and these kind of artists because most rock musicians are also self-taught. It\u2019s not as if you go to a conservatoire \u2013 you just pick up a guitar and struggle to eventually make some kind of noise you find palatable,\u201d says Cocker. \u201cAnd having a band is like making your own little world, something you\u2019re the boss of, something you control.

If you think his work looks unsettling in the back room of a former barber\u2019s shop, Cocker notes, that\u2019s nothing to what it looks like in situ, in Rice\u2019s garden in Alabama.\u201cYou drive into his area and see all these crosses and fridges saying, you know, \u2018CESS PIT HELP ME JESUS BURN IN HELL.\u2019 It\u2019s got a bit of a Deliverance feeling about it.

We all know friends who've lost it or got obsessed</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Outsider art raises unique moral and ethical questions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/01/museum-of-everything-selfridges-review\">James Brett</a>, the exhibition\u2019s curator and the founder of the Gallery of Everything, has worked with outsider artists for more than 15 years. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important that it doesn\u2019t become a freak show \u2013 I really try to make sure that we\u2019re not doing it.\u201d Brett doesn\u2019t even like the term outsider art. \u201cIt sounds negative. It defines itself by an inside and an outside, so the artists \u2013 who are often vulnerable adults, or at least unusual \u2013 find themselves with a word that describes them that suggests an otherness that I felt wasn\u2019t correct. So \u2018non-academic artists\u2019 definitely describes them in one way, and \u2018private art-making\u2019 describes the core of it, because almost all of these artists started making art for a private purpose.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c56a3e41c520ee9802c5903c676c03f4945dcedd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c56a3e41c520ee9802c5903c676c03f4945dcedd/0_85_7099_4661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Art by Howard Finster and Nek Chand Saini at the Gallery of Everything.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Art by Howard Finster and Nek Chand Saini at the Gallery of Everything.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Furthermore, there\u2019s the issue of money. Brett is keen to create a British market for this work \u201cbecause it will bring these artists equivalence\u201d \u2013 everything in the show is for sale, at prices ranging from \u00a31,000 to \u00a350,000 \u2013 but even the notion of selling the work raises intriguing questions. What happens when an artist who created art purely out of compulsion discovers that there may be money to be made? If the power of their work rests, at least in part, on the fact that there are no commercial considerations involved in its creation, does introducing money into the equation fundamentally alter their art, destroying its authenticity? \u201cYou\u2019re 100% right,\u201d Brett says, nodding. \u201cIf I\u2019m working with an artist, I need to make sure they\u2019re not making work to order \u2013 it would be less strong if somebody wants to please. It\u2019s a minefield.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is a difficult area when you come to present the stuff,\u201d agrees Cocker. \u201cBut these artists tap into something universal: the fact that everybody\u2019s got the ability to create things. I think also that\u2019s why people react to this art and have a fascination with it. You can see the amount of work that\u2019s going into it, and you can appreciate that without knowing a backstory. We\u2019ve all got that tendency \u2013 we can all go off on one, can\u2019t we? We all know friends who\u2019ve lost it or got obsessed or whatever, so I think it\u2019s not just like, \u2018Ooh, let\u2019s look at these weird and wacky people.\u2019 It tells you something about human creativity and what it can do,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause almost all of the artists I met on that journey, the one question they could never answer was, \u2018Why do you do it?\u2019 That seemed to be a completely superfluous question \u2013 it was like they had to do it, and through doing it they would find some peace and contentment. And I think we\u2019re all a bit like that. We all have to find something that we love to do that makes us feel OK in the world.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 Jarvis Cocker\u2019s Journeys into the Outside is at the <a href=\"http://www.gallevery.com/\">Gallery of Everything</a>, London, until 20 November.</p>",

He was speaking on behalf of Fight for $15, which started off as a campaign for a $15 an hour minimum wage in the fast food sector but which is now <a href=\"http://fightfor15.org/why-we-strike/\">a global minimum wage campaign.</a></p> <p>The international speaker rarely receives much attention, and you won\u2019t see any clips from the speech on the news. But it was the probably best speech anyone has delivered so far from the conference platform, and it explained why support for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s agenda on the left is so strong better than John McDonnell\u2019s speech did.</p> <p>Unfortunately there isn\u2019t a text, but here are some key quotes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have a completely different type of economy today, and you can see it in many industries that once gave people a real shot at the middle class.</p> <p>If you look at the airports, it used to be if you worked at an airport, you worked for one of the two or three airlines in the US, no matter if you were selling tickets, or taking tickets, or driving the airplane, or serving drinks on the plane. Today, instead of working for those three or four airlines, you work for a contractor of a contractor of a contractor of the airline. You are four or five or six steps removed the real boss and where the real money is and as a result of that those jobs that in 1975 in the airports, those jobs were union, decent wages, had health insurance, today they make $7.25 an hour, no pension, no health insurance, no nothing.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s worse than that in airports. If you push one of the wheelchairs around, you are not allowed to ask for a tip, but you are allowed to accept them, so because of that you\u2019re only paid two bucks an hour. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like in the US in an industry that was 100% union, where people had decent jobs.</p> <p>Truck drivers, the same story. 1975, virtually every truck driver in the United States was in the Teamsters union. They weren\u2019t rich, it was hard work, but they had a decent life. They had a fair wage. They could hope, if they did everything right, they played by the rules, they could get their kid into school and their kid would live a better life. Today, because of deregulation, the union has been busted. Almost no truck drivers in the United States are in the Teamsters union today. </p> <p>These did not happen by accident. They did not happen because we lack money and it did not happen because it was some false choice. These are choices and priorities that our country made. Last year, just to give you a few examples of some of our choices, the money given out in Wall Street bonuses - not pay, bonuses - was more than the total earnings of every American making the minimum wage. That\u2019s a choice. </p> <p>Today corporate profits make up the largest ever share of the United States economy and wages make up the lowest share. That\u2019s a choice. Today the pay of the average fast food CEO is more than 1,200 times the average fast food worker. That\u2019s also a choice.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1dcd944a39f85ea867983fa862d341d7fa51e57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1dcd944a39f85ea867983fa862d341d7fa51e57/0_91_3459_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Courtney of the \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign addressing the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Courtney of the \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign addressing the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e94657e4b08ee6d0d2f04f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T16:03:59.160Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ian Lavery,</strong> the shadow minister for trade unions, appealed to delegates in his speech to the conference to contribute to Labour\u2019s Workplace 2020 consultation on what the world of work will look like in the future.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Workplace 2020 ... will be the biggest discussion with working people and employers in a generation.

(I did not cover it at the time because I was otherwise engaged.) And he seemed to be rattling his sabre at Labour MPs who do not support Jeremy Corbyn.

A vision of socialist change and a rejection of free market capitalism. </p> <p>It was Harold Wilson who won four general elections, who once said \u2018If Labour is not a moral crusade then we\u2019re nothing\u2019. </p> <p>Now I\u2019ve heard people lecture us about the futility of principles without power.

However, businesses will be wary of his combative tone in places and a focus on extensive intervention. </p> </blockquote> <p>From Adam Marshall, acting director general of the <strong>British Chambers of Commerce</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>John McDonnell talks of an \u2018interventionist\u2019 future Labour government, but needs to remember that there\u2019s both good intervention and bad intervention. Good intervention creates the conditions for all businesses to thrive, but bad intervention ensnares them in red tape and makes them less inclined to employ, train or invest.</p> <p>Businesses would welcome a massively expanded infrastructure programme because it helps get the fundamentals right, but their confidence would be undermined by a wave of new regulation and compliance regimes.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Mike Cherry, national chairman of the <strong>Federation of Small Businesses</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>FSB welcomes the high-profile announcement from John McDonnell that the Opposition will look at expanding the employment allowance, which was arguably one of FSB\u2019s biggest wins in recent years.</p> <p>Our members will also be pleased by moves to create new small business workspaces in local communities, strengthen small business access to finance to enable them to grow, shake-up the energy market to allow small local suppliers to compete and innovate, and bring greater parity between how the welfare system treats the self-employed and the employed.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Tim Thomas, head of employment and skills policy at <strong>EEF</strong>, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst we are supportive of a national living wage, this proposal [the minimum wage increase] would be extremely damaging. Entry level jobs would be wiped out at a stroke and, the impact on costs for employers through maintaining pay at all levels would be so dramatic that it\u2019s doubtful to see how companies would take on new workers.

All well and good but what use is that if Labour fails to oppose Trident replacement? How can Labour claim to work for multilateral disarmament if it supports the government building a new nuclear weapons system at a cost of \u00a3205bn? This means Labour is supporting nuclear rearmament.</p> <p>Lewis has clearly signalled that the Labour leadership will not seek to change Labour policy and appears to have abandoned its defence review conducted extensively over the past year. The majority of Labour members oppose Trident replacement, so where is the democracy in that?</p> <p>Lewis made it clear that this was a decision designed to avoid political attack by the prime minister - but it has merely handed Theresa May support for one of her most controversial projects.</p> <p>There is enormous opposition to Trident replacement within the Labour party and there will be huge disappointment at this U-turn by Clive Lewis. We have no doubt that Labour members will work to oppose this disastrous announcement and bring a democratic debate to Labour\u2019s conference next year.

Some of it sounded a bit technical and dull (or \u201cone for the business pages\u201d, as political reporters would put it) but that level of seriousness is a bonus in a speech from a shadow chancellor. And McDonnell does have a governing philosophy, which he has lifted from Mariana Mazzucato, the economist who sits on Labour\u2019s economic advisory committee. She wrote a well-regarded book called <a href=\"http://marianamazzucato.com/the-entrepreneurial-state/\">The Entrepreneurial State</a>, which now seems to be McDonnell\u2019s routemap.</p> <p>But, given the amount of substance in McDonnell\u2019s speech, it was surprising that the party decided to push the \u00a310 minimum wage as his big announcement. Why? <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/15/story_n_8138900.html\">Because McDonnell announced this a year ago, in what was described as his first policy announcement as shadow chancellor</a>. There was a tiny bit more detail this year, and the policy plays well with a Labour audience, but it was an old one, and it is already generating significant criticism from business.</p> <p>Although some of Corbyn\u2019s individual policies are popular, Labour still polls badly compared to the Tories on the issue of economic credibility. This morning McDonnell claimed that Labour and groups like the CBI and the IoD were all \u201con the same page\u201d in terms of economic policy. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8d371e4b03598d1ce8af8#block-57e8d371e4b03598d1ce8af8\">10.26am.)</a> If he can prove that is true, those poll numbers may start to shift.

It was a speech that contained various surprises. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis said Labour would make multilateral disarmament a priority.</strong> Emily Thornberry said the same thing earlier (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8ef7ee4b0831a514026de#block-57e8ef7ee4b0831a514026de\"> 11.01am)</a> and glossed over what this meant for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan to commit Labour to unilateral disarmament too. Lewis was a bit more forthcoming, admitting that Labour is divided on this.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As you know, I am sceptical about Trident renewal, as are many here.</p> <p>But I am clear that our Party has a policy for Trident renewal.</p> <p>But I also want to be clear that our Party\u2019s policy is also that we all share the ambition of a nuclear-free world.</p> <p>So we will take steps to make that ambition a reality.</p> <p>So we will make our long-standing multilateralism reality, not rhetoric. We will be working with international organisations, including the United Nations General Assembly First Committee on Disarmament and International Security, within the spirit and the letter of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p> <p>That will stand in stark contrast to the Tories\u2019 lip service on nuclear disarmament; they have not brought forward a single proposal as to how they intend to achieve it.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is interesting for two reasons. First, some of Corbyn\u2019s allies have argued that Labour effectively does not have a policy on Trident, because it is subject to review. They made this argument around the time of the Commons vote on Trident. But Lewis is saying that the party does have a policy, and that it is to renew Trident.</p> <p>Second, by stressing Labour\u2019s commitment to multilateral disarmament, as Thornberry did, Lewis may be pointing to a possible compromise that would enable the party to go into the election with a policy backed by Corbyn and the pro-Trident unions. (A policy that says achieving multilateral disarmament is the priority, allowing Corbyn to say he is still committed to getting rid of the UK\u2019s nuclear weapons, and Unite and the GMB to say that the party would not scrap Trident?)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis praised Nato, saying it was a body that embodies Labour values. </strong>(It was set up partly at the behest of Ernest Bevin, Labour\u2019s post-war foreign secretary.) Lewis said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, when I look at our key military alliance \u2013 NATO \u2013 I see an organisation that springs directly from our values: collectivism, internationalism and the strong defending the weak. Its founding charter \u2013 a progressive charter \u2013 includes standing up for democracy and defending human rights. These are values that I believe go to the core of our political identity. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is significant because in the past Corbyn has been very sceptical about Nato. During the Labour leadership contest last year he was initially reluctant to commit to keeping the UK in Nato, although he firmed up his support for Nato after his suggestion that Britain could leave the organisation left him exposed to criticism.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis said that Labour would fulfilling its commitments under Nato, including its collective defence obligations under article 5.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So, of course, a Labour government would fulfil our international commitments, including those under Article 5. But let\u2019s be clear: that means both our military and our diplomatic obligations. We cannot have one without the other, and nor should we.</p> </blockquote> <p>This sounds like a rebuke to Corbyn who, at a hustings in August, was reluctant to give this commitment. Asked what the UK would do if Russia invaded a fellow Nato member, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/08/jeremy-corbyns-nato-stance-first-labour-leader\">Corbyn replied:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t wish to go to war. What I want to do is achieve a world where we don\u2019t need to go to war, where there is no need for it. That can be done.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour would maintain defence spending at at least 2% of GDP.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every Labour government since Attlee\u2019s has met NATO\u2019s spending target of at least 2 per cent of GDP, every single year.

Here is the key extract:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is almost 60 years since a Labour Shadow Foreign Secretary demanded that, when it came to negotiations over nuclear weapons, he not be sent naked into the conference chamber. But people forget what Nye Bevan said beforehand in that famous speech.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt is not a question of who is in favour of the bomb, but what is the most effective way of getting the damn thing destroyed. It is the most difficult of all problems facing mankind.\u201d</p> <p>What would Bevan think of the fact that six decades on, we are now further than ever from solving that problem, and that the conference chamber he spoke of lies empty and silent.</p> <p>We all know how irresponsible it would be to ignore the problem of climate change, allow it to get worse, and leave our children and grand-children to worry about the consequences.</p> <p>So why don\u2019t we say the same about nuclear weapons which have the power to destroy the world we live in within minutes, not just over decades?</p> <p>So a future Labour government will not just revive talks on multilateral nuclear disarmament among the world\u2019s great powers, we will make the success of those talks the test of our success on foreign policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thornberry was talking about multilateral nuclear disarmament. Corbyn is also committed to unilateral disarmament (getting rid of Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent regardless of what other countries do) but he has not yet persuaded the party to adopt this policy and at the moment the issue is still under review. Thornberry\u2019s speech did not say anything about how the party would resolve this issue.</p> <p>Her speech was also noteworthy for what she said about Corbyn. No other shadow minister speaking from the platform has praised him so lavishly. She told delegates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, I\u2019m so proud to stand here today in Liverpool: a loyal member of Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet in what is now again Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party ...</p> <p>When I was selected for the neighbouring seat [to Corbyn\u2019s] in 2005 we were behind to the Liberals in every poll.</p> <p>On election day, without anyone asking him to, Jeremy left his own constituency and went round by himself knocking on doors in mine, telling voters: \u201cI know you disagreed with Iraq and so did I, so did Emily, we were on the marches together; you\u2019ve got to get out and vote Labour.\u201d I won by 484 votes.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got to know Jeremy very well since then and there\u2019s many words I know that sum him up: kindness, generosity, courage. But there\u2019s one above all and that word is integrity.</p> <p>From the constituents he represents in Ronalds Road to the Labour members he represents throughout this country, he is someone we believe in and someone we trust.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> The Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon says this passage went down particularly well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelPDeacon/status/780332568721887232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Emily Thornberry speech at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/lab16?src=hash\">#lab16</a>.

Here are the key points he has made.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell ruled out an early shadow cabinet reshuffle.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8cd20e4b03598d1ce8ada#block-57e8cd20e4b03598d1ce8ada\">8.31am.)</a></li> </ul> <p><em>UPDATE AT 3.35PM: </em>A Labour source has been in touch to say that, when John McDonnell ruled out an early shadow cabinet reshuffle on the Today programme this morning, he was not intending to give out that message. So it is possible that we might get a shadow cabinet reshuffle soon after the party conference after all.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said that Jeremy Corbyn did campaign hard for a remain vote in the EU referendum - but that he deliberately avoided being \u201cEurophile\u201d.</strong> Alan Johnson, the chair of Labour In Britain, and others have accused Corbyn of adopting a half-hearted approach to campaigning. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/marieleconte/leaked-emails-raise-more-questions-for-corbyn-team-over-eu-c?utm_term=.jeOMVa1ROd#.gevK8DwY72\">Leaked emails have shown that Corbyn\u2019s office repeatedly toned down the pro-EU content in Corbyn\u2019s campaign speeches. </a>Asked about this, McDonnell said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the accusation that Corbyn did not campaign properly for a remain vote.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was really shocked at that ... Not just Alan ... There was this view Jeremy didn\u2019t do enough during the campaign. I saw what he did. He travelled hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles, meetings all around the country. We were knocking on doors all round the country, holding mass meetings as well.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about why draft speeches were altered, McDonnell said he and Corbyn met Hilary Benn, the then shadow foreign secretary, and Angela Eagle, the then shadow business secretary, last September to explain his approach to the referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We explained to them our view was that the best way of campaigning was to remain, but reform as well, because of the criticisms [of the EU]. If we went solely on a Europhile basis we never stood a chance, particularly in areas outside of London and the south east that felt left behind in the economy overall. So our argument was remain but reform, and create a reform agenda.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell said that Labour wanted the UK to retain \u201caccess\u201d to the single market, casting doubt on the extent of Labour\u2019s opposition to a \u201chard\u201d Brexit</strong>. Yesterday Corbyn told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr that he was opposed to a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, implying the party would fight to retain full single market membership. When asked about this, McDonnell just said the party wanted \u201caccess to the single market\u201d. When pressed why he would not commit to opposing a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t want to restrict ourselves at the moment in the discussions that we are having with our European colleagues.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell dismissed David Blunkett\u2019s critique of Jeremy Corbyn (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8d4a4e4b0f55a9f4034a8#block-57e8d4a4e4b0f55a9f4034a8\">9.07am),</a> saying Blunkett was \u201ccompletely out of touch\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a lot of time for David but I just think he\u2019s completely out of touch. He should come here and talk to us about the policies we are debating at conference, all of which I think have really mass popular support. In addition to that, he should come, just feel the vibe here, because we\u2019ve got a massive new party now with over 600,000 members wanting to get out on the streets campaigning.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell suggested Labour would be willing to legislate to ensure better conditions for Uber driver. </strong>Asked if Labour supported Uber, as an example of a new, disruptive business start-up, McDonnell said he was concerned that drivers for the company did not have proper job security (because they are self-employed). He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So what you try to do is work with that company to ensure that they do abide by basic standards and employment conditions. If they don\u2019t, then you need to legislate. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour planned to invest \u00a3250bn in the economy.</strong> He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are setting up a national investment bank. We are putting into that bank \u00a3100bn. Yes, that will be borrowed, but it will be borrowed at the cheapest rates in our history. That will lever in, at the average leverage rate, another \u00a3150bn. And we will use that to invest in our infrastructure, in our skills and we will be working with entrepreneurs. </p> </blockquote> <p>During his leadership campaign Corbyn talked about <a href=\"http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/economy\">a \u00a3500bn investment programme. </a>He confirmed this figure on the Marr Show yesterday. Asked why McDonnell was just highlighting the proposed \u00a3250bn investment, a spokesman for him said that he was only talking about one aspect of the Corbyn plan. The investment programme has not been cut by \u00a3250bn overnight.</p> <p>McDonnell also insisted his investment plans would not lead higher taxes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Short term interventions like that do pay dividends pretty quickly. We think we can get growth growing very quickly in this economy and it will then pay for itself. So in the short term, yes there will be some increased costs, but borrowing at the moment is extremely low-cost.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said business backed Labour\u2019s general approach to the economy.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve been meeting with the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Chambers of Commerce, and we are all on the same page. You need government working with the private sector hand in hand, looking at where investment\u2019s needed - particularly in research and development - and then you develop the products and the markets that enable us to compete effectively with our European and other global competitors. I think that\u2019s the modern way of how you do business in government.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to apologise for calling Esther McVey, the Conservative former disabilities minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/mcdonnell-defends-calling-female-mp-stain-of-inhumanity-esther-mcvey\">a \u201cstain of inhumanity\u201d.</a> </strong>He said he was expressing the anger that people felt about McVey\u2019s disability cuts when he used the phrase in the Commons.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not apologising for the words I used in parliamentary debate. Of course you have to be constrained in your language, but also you have to be honest about how you feel. And sometimes there\u2019s such a thing as justifiable anger. That doesn\u2019t justify words like \u2018lynching\u2019 or anything else but in the parliamentary debate. if you look at my words. you will see it is an honest expression of the anger and anguish I felt in dealing with these families.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed Labour was ahead of the Tories in the polls before the leadership contest.</strong> This claim is misleading (Anthony Wells explains why <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9749\">here, at UK Polling Report)</a>, although, having made the claims in early interviews, McDonnell was more accurate on Today, talking about Labour just being ahead in some polls.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a128471545425337f8a325a02536e3b5b2821dbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a128471545425337f8a325a02536e3b5b2821dbd/0_150_5173_3104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell at the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell at the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T14:35:29.094Z\">at 3.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e8dc48e4b03598d1ce8b11\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T08:30:37.746Z\">9.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Politics Home\u2019s <strong>Kevin Schofield</strong> has more on this morning\u2019s NEC meeting.

There has to be a credible opposition party, one that the wider public can trust. </p> <p>If not, there will be a permanent Conservative majority in the Commons, with nobody to keep the government honest and accountable.</p> <p>And even for the most dyed-in-the-wool Tories that is very bad news. For the country, it\u2019s an utter disaster. Everyone should be as concerned as I am.</p> <p>The Labour party under Corbyn is not electable.

Blunkett goes on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He doesn\u2019t want to fight terrorism \u2013 he can\u2019t even bring himself to denounce Palestinian terrorists or the IRA. </p> <p>He has already said he would never push the nuclear button, and I strongly suspect he could never sanction any kind of war at all.

He has been giving interviews this morning and is about to appear on the Today programme. I will be covering that in detail.</p> <p>Overnight McDonnell and <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, have announced that a future Labour government would compensate deprived regions for any funding they will lose when the UK leaves the EU. The government has promised to make good this shortfall up to 2020, but not beyond that. Labour would continue to compensate them \u201cinto the 2020s and beyond\u201d.</p> <p>Making the announcement, Thornberry said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the period 2014 to 2020, the UK was allocated \u20ac10.8 billion in structural funding for our most deprived regions and communities. The Tories have given an undertaking hedged in conditions that funding up to 2020 will be protected.</p> <p>For the period after, they have said nothing. That is not good enough. Without long-term certainty over funding, our most deprived regions and communities cannot plan ahead. They cannot attract other investment. They cannot make progress.</p> <p>So thanks to John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, we can guarantee that a future Labour government will make up any shortfall in structural funding into the 2020s and beyond. And the same will go for the funding of peace and reconciliation projects in Northern Ireland.</p> </blockquote> <p>McDonnell has already given three interviews this morning. He was keen to talk about the funding announcement, but inevitably other topics have come up, and on Sky he found himself having to explain that he was not in favour of lynching the Tory ex-minister Esther McVey.

The next Labour government will back the clean technologies of the future.\u201d</p> <p>Within minutes, the GMB denounced the proposal, with Gary Smith, its Scotland secretary, saying it was \u201cnot ethical\u201d and an \u201cabdication of our environmental and moral responsibilities\u201d to become increasingly reliant on gas from dictatorial regimes overseas.</p> <p>Stuart Fegan, the GMB\u2019s national officer, added: \u201cIt is a nonsense that any political party serious on forming a government after the next planned general election in 2020 could promote a ban on shale gas extraction outright. With our national dependency on gas consumption set to increase in the immediate future, ruling out the possible use of a natural fuel that exists beneath our feet in parts of the UK is ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Caroline Flint, the former shadow energy secretary, also criticised the proposed ban without there being a policy to replace it. She told a fringe event: \u201cWe can\u2019t just be against things. Nobody is going to vote for a policy if they think that [energy] security is going to be at risk.\u201d<br></p> <p>The stance leaves the party even more strongly opposed to fracking than the Scottish government, which has a moratorium in place until the impacts of hydraulic fracturing are researched further. The Welsh government opposes fracking and has instructed local authorities to turn down applications.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/climate-ministers-bribe-local-fracking-environment\">Nobody can buy the silence of a climate spinning out of control | Caroline Lucas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In contrast to the negative reaction from the GMB, many environmental groups were delighted.

Within the next fortnight, the government will decide whether to accept shale company Cuadrilla\u2019s appeal against Lancashire county council who decided last year to turn down its application for two fracking sites.</p> <p>But even if the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, approves the deal as expected, Cuadrilla said construction at the two sites on the Fylde would require drilling to begin perhaps as early as April next year.</p> <p>The industry trade body told the Guardian that no wells had been drilled into shale in 2016, and it knew of none planned before 2017.</p> <p>Chemicals giant Ineos, which has heralded the promise of a \u201cshale gas revolution\u201d in the UK and last year promised to \u201cmove quickly\u201d, has yet to submit a single shale planning application, it emerged last week, but plans to submit five before the year\u2019s end. Another shale company, Third Energy, recently had its hopes of fracking in North Yorkshire this year dashed due to delays over a legal challenge by Friends of the Earth and a local anti-fracking group.</p> <p>The lack of action on the ground does not match the government\u2019s aspirations for fracking. David Cameron said more than two and half years ago that the UK was going \u201call out for shale\u201d, and ministers one year ago promised they would \u201cfast track\u201d bids.</p> <p>Tony Bosworth, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cReality and rhetoric parted ways long ago on this because quite simply the government backed the wrong horse. Opinion polls repeatedly show that people in the UK strongly support renewables and oppose fracking.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump is winning his war on reality, and can thank America\u2019s biggest news outlets for it. Ahead of tonight\u2019s presidential debate, Trump\u2019s campaign has taken umbrage at the idea that NBC Nightly News anchor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/lester-holt-debate-moderator-trump-clinton-fact-check-election\">Lester Holt</a> might fact-check him, or venture to ask follow-up questions. \u201cAll that we\u2019re asking is that, if Donald Trump lies, that it\u2019s pointed out,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, modestly proposed on ABC\u2019s This Week yesterday. \u201cA lot of people,\u201d Trump warned in response, \u201care watching to see whether or not [Holt] succumbs to that pressure.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In terms of fact-checking, the bar to doing my job is currently higher than for a man looking to lead the free world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even more bizarre than Trump\u2019s bullying is that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/presidential-debate-fact-checking-228653\">networks have caved in to it</a>, rejecting calls for live, on-screen fact-checking (with the exception of Bloomberg TV). That task will now fall entirely to Holt, who\u2019s already facing pushback on the idea that he should intervene in the all-too-likely event that Trump spews nonsense.</p> <p>The Commission on Presidential Debates head, Janet Brown, told CNN that, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica,\u201d adding that it\u2019s the \u201ccandidates\u2019 job to fact-check each other \u2013 not the moderator\u2019s job to fact check them\u201d.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, Brown\u2019s argument might hold up: like Lincoln and Douglas did in 1858, two candidates could come together and \u2013 with some loose facilitation \u2013 hash out their visions for America\u2019s future. But this is no normal election, and Trump is no normal candidate.</p> <p>Any journalist with half any eye toward the future of their profession should have more than a few concerns about what Trump\u2019s authoritarianism and aversion to basic accountability will have on their industry. Worth remembering here is that his campaign has seen a reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-battery-charges\">forcibly grabbed</a>, the Washington Post banned and sexist insults launched at women journalists who dare cross him. If Trump does become president, it isn\u2019t too hard to imagine the White House press corps shrinking to Sean Hannity, Milo Yiannopolous and a handful of misogyny-fueled alt-right Redditors.</p> <p>Still, Trump isn\u2019t an aberration so much as an extension of the Republican party\u2019s toxic last 50 years.

  "<p>A senior former banker at HBOS received a string of bribes over five years \u2013 including cash, use of a credit card, luxury holidays and payments for prostitutes \u2013 in exchange for agreeing bank loans channelled to ailing business with little or no hope of recovery, a court has heard.</p> <p>Lynden Scourfield had been in charge of dealing with many businesses across the South of England and Wales that were struggling to repay HBOS loans, deciding whether the bank should waive repayments, offer further funding, or allow the business to go bust.</p> <p>A jury at Southwark crown court was told on Monday that he had been engaged in a corrupt relationship with former banker and venture capitalist David Mills, who had set up a turnaround consultancy business called Quayside Corporate Services. </p> <p>Scourfield insisted that struggling businesses dependent on HBOS funding must hire the services of Quayside before he would advance further loans. He then signed off further high-risk loans that were not in the interests of the bank.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cScourfield advanced huge sums to the businesses, and continued to do so well past the point when it would have been obvious to any honest banker that the bank debt could and would never be repaid,\u201d prosecution counsel Brian O\u2019Neill QC told the court.</p> <p>This allowed Mills and his associates to demand allegedly excessive fees for consultancy services and, in some instances, provided an opportunity for them to take control of the struggling companies, running them for their own benefit.</p> <p>More than \u00a328m passed from HBOS through the bank accounts of either Mills, his wife or companies under his control, O\u2019Neill said. Not all of that sum stayed with the defendants, he conceded, though Mills and his wife \u201cdid benefit enormously\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, HBOS incurred losses of about \u00a3245m on lending managed by Scourfield, the jury heard, all of which ultimately had to be written off.</p> <p> \u201cThe motivation was greed,\u201d O\u2019Neill told the court. \u201cPolice ... uncovered evidence of huge rewards provided by Mills to Scourfield to effect his corruption. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThis took the form of money transfers, cash, expensive gifts, use of an American Express card for personal spending, unauthorised and inappropriately lavish hospitality, luxurious foreign travel and sexual encounters with high class escorts.\u201d</p> <p>The jury were told to ignore the fact that Scourfield was not sitting alongside Mills and five other defendants in the dock. \u201cHe is not on trial and you must not speculate about his absence or the reasons for it,\u201d O\u2019Neill explained.</p> <p>Mills faces charges of conspiracy to corrupt, fraudulent trading and conspiracy to conceal criminal property. His wife and former business associates Michael Bancroft, Tony Cartwright and Jonathan Cohen, together with a second former HBOS banker Mark Dobson, variously face similar charges. <br></p> <p>Struggling businesses the alleged conspirators were said to have used to conceal their corruption included a textile business called Magenta and a pornographic magazine firm called Remnant.<br></p> <p>The trial continues.<br></p>",

At times, the most harmless human enjoyment is in direct conflict with other animals: an increase in walking, for instance, has caused some shoreline-nesting birds to plummet in number on remote beaches.</p> <p>In Scotland, where wild camping is widely permitted, I see plenty of notices about the \u201cleave no trace\u201d principles \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.scottishcanals.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trowel-leaflet.pdf\" title=\"\">some illustrated with a trowel</a> \u2013 to teach you how to dispose of your business.

Unruly camping could be cleaned up with better education and enforcement.

It worked every time. Wild camping has helped Scotland maintain a healthier culture of enjoying nature than England.

Totally. I go into great detail to ensure everything possible has been done.\u201d</p> <p>There is a fanatical streak in Clarke \u2013 and he admits readily to having obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder \u2013 but his team are fortunate that their captain is also aware of the vast difference between sport and real life. He has a reputation for being tetchy to some interviewees but Clarke\u2019s layered past is far more interesting than whether or not he is in the mood to be charming. Of course it helps that he is relaxed and hospitable today and we can talk about him growing up amid the Troubles and his reaction to personal devastation.</p> <p>Ten years ago this month he produced one of the most memorable displays of Ryder Cup golf when, only weeks after losing his wife Heather to cancer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/sep/25/rydercup2006.rydercup10\" title=\"\">Clarke won all three of his matches at the K&#xa0;Club</a>. His steely performance was followed by a very human reaction at its tearful conclusion, as victory was tempered by grief. After such tumult, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/nov/28/golf.comment\" title=\"\">which we addressed in an interview that year</a>, Clarke should control his emotions in a mere sporting arena.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the big difference. Ten years ago was incredibly testing. The most pressure I will ever, ever feel is on the first hole of that 2006 Ryder Cup. Walking to that first tee, hitting that first shot, the world watching so soon after losing Heather, was like nothing else. Nothing compares to that intensity. Down the stretch at the Open in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/17/open-2011-darren-clarke-wins\" title=\"\">when Clarke won his only major</a>], did that experience help me win? I guess it did. The Ryder Cup first tee is a place where very few people get to stand and, in 2006, the pressure was unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke smiles at the tears that followed \u2013 when he said men from County Tyrone were not meant to cry or hug one another. But his emotion was uncorked after his singles opponent Zach Johnson conceded the putt that gave Clarke the win. \u201cIt was a lovely gesture which meant so much. I will cherish forever the support I got from my team and the Americans.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All I ask for is etiquette when our team hit their shots. Home support is an integral part of the Ryder Cup</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This week a fevered home crowd will provide partisan support but Clarke is suitably sanguine. \u201cAll I ask for is etiquette when our team hit their shots. Home support is an integral part of the Ryder Cup and creates its unique atmosphere. It\u2019s going to be loud because Davis Love III [the USA captain] and his team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/10/davis-love-iii-ryder-cup-wildcards-darren-clarke-hazeltine\" title=\"\">want to win it back</a>. But it\u2019s a huge compliment to Europe that America have formulated a taskforce to figure out how to win.</p> <p>\u201cThe atmosphere is going to be right on the edge. But Davis and I have been friends a long time and if anyone moves over that line I\u2019m sure he will step in. If roles are reversed I\u2019ll do exactly that. It\u2019s not life or death. It\u2019s sport \u2013 a game of golf.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s illuminating to meet Clarke in Belfast and to reflect on how far Northern Ireland has moved from sectarian violence. Hearing him talk about a conflict as bloody and tangled as the Troubles underpins his emphasis that the Ryder Cup, which can carry a militaristic jingoism in the US, is nothing more nor less than sporting theatre. \u201cBelfast has a wonderful feel about it these days. There are great restaurants and bars. We\u2019re so far along the peace process that people are too used to it to ever let it go back to how it was.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke grew up 40 miles away in Dungannon and he grimaces when asked if the worst of the Troubles reached his home town. \u201cOh, they did. They were all over the place. Dungannon was right in the middle of an area where lots of dark stuff happened. There was trouble everywhere. Thankfully we\u2019ve come a long way from those dark old days but we didn\u2019t give in to fear. People in Northern Ireland are very resilient. Throughout the Troubles they battled on to live as normally as they could.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/rory-mcilroy-ryder-cup-darren-clarke-hazeltine\">Rory McIlroy excited at prospect of helping boyhood hero Clarke win Ryder Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It seems incredible that, in Belfast in the 1980s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/18/carl-frampton-jeremy-parodi-barry-mcguigan\" title=\"\">boxers from Republican areas would be embraced on the Loyalist Shankill Road</a> \u2013 and amateur fighters from fiercely unionist territories were proud to box for Ireland. \u201cGolf was another mixed one,\u201d Clarke stresses. \u201cA few sports were untouched and we all played for Ireland. There is no Northern Irish golf team. Same with boxing, rugby and swimming. I was fortunate to be in two unifying sports. I played rugby and golf and they were inclusive. I was Protestant but it was no problem playing for Ireland. I was lucky because my parents got me travelling around Ireland playing in boys\u2019 tournaments. My eyes were opened to a big and different world and I wasn\u2019t here day in, day out, while the Troubles were raging.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s love of the Ryder Cup coincided with the advent of a European team to replace Great Britain and Ireland as the USA\u2019s opponents. \u201cI was born in 1968 and swept up in the Ryder Cup as a teenager. Seve [Ballesteros] changed everything when Europe became part of the Ryder Cup [in 1979] and it\u2019s grown massively.\u201d</p> <p>The 2016 Ryder Cup is being held only weeks before a US election where, disturbingly, Donald Trump harbours hopes of becoming president while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/21/ryder-cup-donald-trump-brexit-usa-europe\" title=\"\">Britain and Europe are still absorbing the Brexit fallout</a>. Clarke, unsurprisingly, does not indulge in Brexit discussions. \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d he&#xa0;stonewalls.</p> <p>Surely the European players talk about Brexit? \u201cNo. Our game is global.

Yes, it would be unprecedented for Europe to win four times in a row. Yes, I would love to add another European victory to the list.

  "<p>The final jape carried out by the trickster demigod M\u0101ui sounds more like the stuff of horror movies than a Disney children\u2019s animation. <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EP4DnCdbB1cC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=maui+death+teeth+vagina&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X0K2wH_BPO&amp;sig=EcBEhCBOMPhPxBiWj1L0XFcKGng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivl_X35KzPAhWIKMAKHVjnC7gQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=maui%20death%20teeth%20vagina&amp;f=false\">According to M\u0101ori mythology</a> (and M\u0101ui is a figure across many cultures with Polynesian roots, so the story differs depending on who\u2019s telling it) the shapeshifting hero was crushed between a set of obsidian teeth in the vagina of the goddess of death, Hine-nui-te-p\u014d, while in the form of a worm. He had been trying to travel through the body of the deity while she slept in an attempt to bring immortality to mankind.</p> <p>Disney has naturally gone in a different direction with its depiction of the mythological figure in its forthcoming film Moana, at least going by the 25 minutes of footage presented to journalists in London last Friday. Here, M\u0101ui (voiced by Dwayne Johnson) appears to have retained his famously mischievous disposition and ability to change into different creatures. The rest is absent. But there are still teeth in the tale, as the studio has discovered following a run of negative publicity ahead of the film\u2019s November release.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/27/disney-depiction-of-obese-polynesian-god-in-film-moana-sparks-anger\">Disney depiction of obese Polynesian god in film Moana sparks anger</a> </p> </aside>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKFuXETZUsI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LKFuXETZUsI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/27/disney-depiction-of-obese-polynesian-god-in-film-moana-sparks-anger\">In June, reports from New Zealand</a> suggested that some public figures of Polynesian background were less than impressed with the depiction of M\u0101ui as a bulky and oversized figure. New Zealand MP Jenny Salesa, who is of Tongan heritage, shared a picture on her Facebook account describing the film\u2019s hero as \u201chalf pig, half hippo\u201d. Then last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/22/disney-pulls-maui-childrens-costume-amid-claims-it-is-offensive\">Disney confirmed it would stop selling a boy\u2019s M\u0101ui costume</a> that some Pacific Islanders had compared to blackface, because the outfit was designed to resemble M\u0101ui\u2019s heavily tattooed, musclebound bare torso.</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising then that producer Osnat Shurer was keen to flag up Disney\u2019s careful research into Polynesian myth ahead of making the film, with directors John Musker and Ron Clements (known for hand-drawn Disney classics such as The Little Mermaid and Aladdin) having visited Fiji, Samoa, and Tahiti in 2012 in order to immerse themselves in local culture. Moana also features actors of Polynesian heritage in several of the main roles, including Johnson himself, Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords, Temuera Morrison of Once Were Warriors and 14-year-old Hawaiian-American Auli\u2019i Cravalho as the title character.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/22/disney-pulls-maui-childrens-costume-amid-claims-it-is-offensive\">Disney pulls Maui children's costume amid claims it is offensive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the film, Moana is the determined teenage daughter of a chief, who discovers that her people\u2019s history as ocean navigators has been hidden from her and sets out to find the author of their single-island entrapment, M\u0101ui. When they do finally meet, it\u2019s instantly clear the demigod has an elevated view of his own importance and expects Moana to bow down and treat him like a Polynesian rock star. Instead, Moana admonishes the oversized braggart for trapping her people for centuries after losing his magical fish-hook. </p> <p>On screen, Johnson\u2019s character appears more powerful than obese: there is certainly no wobbling flesh on show, merely a remarkable sense of dexterity and elastic grace for such an enormous fellow \u2013 but then he is a god. Moana, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/going-out/film/next-disney-film-moana-defy-8913849\">as Shurer has remarked</a>, also has a healthy body shape, Disney perhaps learning from the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/nov/28/frozen-disney-female-body-image\">backlash against the tiny waists of Frozen\u2019s Anna and Elsa</a>.

The demigod\u2019s tattoos come thrillingly to life, gorgeously hand-drawn 2D animation slotting cleverly into the CGI visuals, as he regales his young companion with tales of past glories. From journeys into the underworld to battles with giant fire monsters and coconut-armoured pirate creatures known as Kakamora, the pair\u2019s adventures also represent a liberating shift away from the traditional basis of these films in northern European legend. </p> <p>Not to mention that the very concept of cultural appropriation is a tangled one. Did, for instance, Dreamworks Animation \u201csteal\u201d eastern martial arts for the Kung Fu Panda movies? And if so, why are those films so popular in the world\u2019s most populous nation that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/11/AR2008071103281.html\">China has rejigged its entire film industry to try to produce its own equivalent</a>? Should Disney be held to account for borrowing liberally from Japanese culture on the recent Big Hero Six? </p> <p>Perhaps the studio simply needs to be a little more careful when borrowing stories from foreign cultures, especially as this is the company that once <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_at9dOElQk\">gave us the savage, pidgin English-speaking subhuman \u201cRed Indians\u201d in 1953\u2019s Peter Pan</a>, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC_mV1IpjWA\">Sebastian the workshy Caribbean crab</a> in 1989\u2019s The Little Mermaid. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC_mV1IpjWA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GC_mV1IpjWA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It will be interesting to see what the reaction to Moana is from people of Polynesian backgrounds when the movie itself hits UK cinemas on 2 December (23 November in the US).

The profit margins are enormous. The poacher in Africa sells ivory at up to $150 a kilo. At the other end of the supply line, in Beijing, it sells for well over ten times as much, with some sales reaching $2,025 a kilo, according to research by Chatham House. The markup is even bigger with rhino horn: from $1,000 for a pair of horns (average weight 6kg each) at poacher level to upwards of $66,000 a kilo in China.</p> <p>Profits have increased dramatically over the past decade, driven by the wealthy new elites in Asia, accumulating ivory carvings and tiger skins as status symbols for their homes; buying ground powder of rhino horn and tiger-bone wine as traditional remedies for almost every ailment from hangovers to cancer, none of it based on any scientific evidence. This is a demand driven by two things: greed and superstition. </p> <p>For a gangster, these animals are like bundles of cash lying almost unprotected in the wilderness.

Other agencies try to fill the gap.

None of them goes out to catch criminals.

From African bush to Asian jungle to Russian steppe, the valuable parts of animals are ripped and sliced from their skeletal sockets and shovelled onto invisible conveyor belts, almost all headed for the same destinations in South East Asia and China.

The conveyor belt to Asia sags under the weight of the ivory from something like 90 dead African elephants every day. In 2013, a single seizure in Guangzhou uncovered 1,913 tusks, the product of nearly 1,000 dead animals. The US National Academy of Sciences in 2014 found that in the previous three years poachers had killed 100,000 elephants, reducing the species to a total of only 450,000 in all Africa. And the numbers are still falling: the kill rate has exceeded the birth rate every year since 2010. Central Africa has lost 76% of its elephants since 2002.

  "<p>Murders in the US rose<strong> </strong>10.8% last year, the biggest single-year percentage jump since 1971, according to data released Monday by the FBI.<br></p> <p>The rising violence was driven by an increase in the murders of black men, and by an increase in the number of gun murders. At least 900 more black men were killed in 2015 than in 2014, according to FBI data.</p> <p>There were roughly 1,500 additional firearm murders in 2015. No other type of weapon saw a comparable increase. The number of knife murders dropped slightly. </p> <p>The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide-pct-change-sep-26-update/\" data-alt=\"Percent changes year to year\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide-pct-change-sep-26-update/\">Percent changes year to year</a> </figure>  <p><em> </em></p> <p>The net increase in murders, which follows a two-decade downward trend, erased the gains of the past few years, and put the number of murders back at 15,696, about the same number as in 2009. Murder and violent crime are still dramatically lower than they were at the peak of the violent crime wave of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The national murder rate last year was about half what it was in 1991. </p> <p>Even as murders rose, the country\u2019s overall crime rates did not increase as substantially. There was a 3.9% increase in the estimated number of violent crimes, but a 2.6% decrease in the estimated number of property crimes. </p> <p>Speaking at a violence prevention conference in Little Rock, Arkansas, attorney general Loretta Lynch said that, despite an \u201coverall increase\u201d in violent crime, 2015 still represented \u201cthe third-lowest year for violent crime in the past two decades\u201d.</p> <p>Her prepared remarks did not mention the 10.8% increase in murders. </p> <p>\u201cWe still have so much work to do,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cBut the report also reminds us of the progress that we are making. It shows that in many communities, crime has remained stable or even decreased from the historic lows reported in 2014.\u201d </p> <p>A third of the murder increase was driven by upticks in just ten larger cities: Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Washington DC, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Nashville, Kansas City, Missouri, St Louis, and Oklahoma City. </p> <p>Baltimore saw the greatest increase in murders, with 133 more people killed in 2015 than in 2014, pushing the city to its <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-deadliest-year-20160101-story.html\">highest-ever murder rate</a>.

The 10 cities that drove a third of the murder increase only account for 13% of total murders in the US, he noted. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/percent-firearm-homicides/\" data-alt=\"Guns uses for homicides\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/percent-firearm-homicides/\">Guns uses for homicides</a> </figure>  <p>There is no consensus yet on what factors might be driving a sharp increase in murders alone, but crime has become a politically charged election issue, and the uptick will probably figure in Monday\u2019s presidential debate. </p> <p>Crime trend experts said they expected politicians to overplay the significance of the new numbers and to react with \u201chysteria\u201d.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/fbi-murder-rate-rise-donald-trump-presidential-debate\">FBI to reveal likely murder spike on same day as first presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou lost 50lb.

Last year, 143 of the city\u2019s murder victims were black men and boys killed with guns, according to data from the police department. Local residents were not optimistic that a debate over a national murder increase would make them safer.</p> <p>\u201cHow do we use that data to elevate the consciousness of our community? How do we use that data to provide the opportunity for people to get meaningful jobs, with livable wages?\u201d said Jeffrey Boyd, a St Louis alderman who has lost three young male relatives to gun violence since 2003.</p> <p>\u201cI have no confidence in our federal government that they will provide an extra dime for anything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide-update/\" data-alt=\"Murders since 1960\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide-update/\">Murders since 1960</a> </figure>  <p>Advocates for criminal justice reform said they worried the one-year uptick would fuel calls for a return to damaging, tough-on-crime policies. The US has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/07/yes-u-s-locks-people-up-at-a-higher-rate-than-any-other-country/\">one of the highest incarceration rates</a> in the world, and both violent crime and mass incarceration disproportionately affect black Americans. </p> <p>The human cost of an overreaction to the murder increase could be \u201ca lot bigger\u201d than the toll of the rising violence itself, Pfaff said. He said he expected the increase to prompt calls for more arrests and more prison time. </p> <p>The wealthier white Americans whose votes help determine crime policy \u201cdon\u2019t tend to be those who feel the costs\u201d, Pfaff said. </p> <p><strong></strong> </p> <p>Early data from large cities this year suggests that 2015\u2019s uptick in murders may not be a single-year increase. A <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/crime-2016-preliminary-analysis\">report from the Brennan Center</a>, analyzing murders in 30 large cities this year, projected an additional 13.1% increase in the murder rates for those cities in 2016, with most of that increase being driven by just three cities: Chicago, Baltimore and Houston. Together, the national large city increases in 2015 and 2016 were projected to drive a 31.5% increase in the murder rate compared with 2014. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no evidence of a national murder wave, yet increases in these select cities are indeed a serious problem,\u201d the Brennan Center report concluded. Chicago alone has seen a close to 50% increase in shootings and murders this year. </p> <p>The FBI director, James Comey, has repeatedly drawn a connection between increasing violence and \u201ca change in how the police are doing their work\u201d due to the continuing nationwide protests over police killings of black citizens. </p> <p>\u201cIn today\u2019s YouTube world, are officers reluctant to get out of their cars and do the work that controls violent crime?\u201d he asked in 2015, describing \u201ca chill wind that has blown through law enforcement over the last year\u201d.</p> <p>In May, he suggested the increasing violence could be related to \u201cmarginal pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers\u201d, and said that police leaders across the country had seen a change in how their officers do their jobs. </p> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s administration has repeatedly rejected any connection between protests over police violence and increasing murders. But a Justice Department-funded report on the 2015 murder increase concluded that there <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/15/ferguson-effect-homicide-rates-us-crime-study\">might be some connection</a> between public anger over police killings and an increase in community violence. </p> <p>Criminologists caution that crime and violence are highly local, and driven by a tangle of so many different factors that it is nearly impossible to say exactly what causes a given increase or decrease. Crime statistics are also easy to over-dramatize. Murder numbers in a small town, for instance, can be dramatically distorted by a single incident with multiple casualties. A town that typically sees a murder a year will see a 100% increase in murders if it ends the year with two. </p> <p>New York City, which saw more than 2,000 murders a year in the early 1990s, saw just 352 last year, according to New York police department data. Los Angeles, which saw more than 1,000 murders a year in the early 1990s, has seen fewer than 300 in recent years. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e56e37e8dcb6826254bcb9285a380f860fd29d67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e56e37e8dcb6826254bcb9285a380f860fd29d67/0_176_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"donald trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has attacked the Obama administration for a \u2018rollback of criminal enforcement\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara D Davis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama\">blamed Obama</a> and his administration for a \u201crollback of criminal enforcement\u201d that has made the country less safe. </p> <p> This criticism is not supported by the FBI\u2019s murder data. Murders have declined through most of Obama\u2019s two terms, with a serious uptick only in his second-to-last year in office. Between 2008, the year before Obama took office, and 2014, murders dropped, with 2,000 fewer Americans murdered in 2014 than in the last year of George W Bush\u2019s administration. </p> <p>Crime experts also cautioned that a single-year uptick was not a trend. \u201cIt\u2019s the curse of success. Because we\u2019re doing better, a similar absolute change will look worse,\u201d Pfaff said.</p> <p>Despite a general downward trend over the past decades, nationwide murder numbers have increased in some recent years. In 2005, for instance, murders increased by 3.67%, according to FBI data, then increased a further 3% in 2006.</p> <p>In October 2006, the Police Executive Research Forum released a <a href=\"http://www.policeforum.org/assets/docs/Critical_Issues_Series/a%20gathering%20storm%20-%20violent%20crime%20in%20america%202006.pdf\">report </a>warning the country about \u201ca gathering storm of violent crime that threatens to erode the considerable crime reductions of the past\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cViolent crime in many of the nation\u2019s cities, from one coast to the other, has begun to spike upwards,\u201d the report argued. \u201cThe percentage of violent crime in America had the largest single-year increase in 14 years.\u201d</p> <p>The next year, murders resumed a downward trend.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone started freaking out. It was a two-year thing,\u201d Butts said.</p> <p>Criminal justice reform is \u201cone of the greatest civil rights efforts of our time\u201d, said Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change, the nation\u2019s largest online racial justice organization. <br></p> <p>Trump and other politicians, he said, \u201chave started us down a path to undo long-fought gains in criminal justice reform, and we should not let the positive momentum be derailed by a lack of facts, by fear, by racism and by demagoguery\u201d.</p> <p>Even Heather Mac Donald, a conservative crime analyst who saluted Trump\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d focus, said in July that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama\">inaccurate</a> to blame federal crime policy for murder increases. </p> <p>In general, the president and the federal government have very little power to determine the country\u2019s response to crime and violence. The country has 18,000 local law enforcement agencies of different kinds, including more than <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd13ppp.pdf\">12,000 local police departments</a>, which are largely independent from federal control. Most power to determine crime policy is in the hands of state legislators, and local mayors, police chiefs and prosecutors. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Trump and Clinton have outlined competing visions of violence prevention,<strong> </strong>with Trump touting a tough-on-crime approach, and Clinton focusing on the need to reform police treatment of black Americans and reduce gun violence through tougher gun control laws. </p> <p>These contrasting views have symbolic importance, but neither Trump nor Clinton would have much direct influence, as president, over how cities and states address violence. The justice department can use federal funding as a carrot or stick for local departments to adopt different policies, but this is a fairly limited tool for pushing top-down changes.</p> <p><em>Jamiles Lartey contributed reporting from St Louis</em></p>",

The work focuses on a doctor haunted by her role in the country\u2019s population control effort, where women are often given incentives to be sterilised and doctors have targets to reach in insanitary conditions.</p> <p>\u201cThe big question is why spend so much money and resources on birth control as opposed to providing [better] healthcare,\u201d says Simha. \u201cOf course the birth rates are very high, but so are the infant mortality rates. It\u2019s an agrarian society so you do require hands in the field and you know that at least three of your five kids are going to die in the first 10 years of their life, so of course the birth rate is going to be high in those regions. Why not provide medical facilities?\u201d<br></p> <p>To research her play, Simha spent two weeks in a rural village in the state of Jharkhand. \u201cIt was quite revealing,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no electricity in the primary health centres and there\u2019s no transportation.

On Saturday, he did \u2013 and it was a beauty, too, bursting through to belt in the winner in a game his coach called a \u201ccl\u00e1sico\u201d, against Sevilla. \u201cThe nicest thing was seeing how happy it made my team-mates,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AthleticClub/status/779762643259297792\" title=\"\">he said</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/26/serie-a-torino-roma-joe-hart-andrea-belotti\">Torino lay foundations for stab at Europe thanks to Joe Hart and the Rooster | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was that kind of weekend, one in which Balenziaga scored \u2013 putting Athletic on four wins in a row and extending Sevilla\u2019s record without an away win to 22 \u2013 and Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo didn\u2019t; a weekend that started with people asking if Barcelona would miss the injured Argentinian and ended with them asking if anyone missed Dani Alves instead after a 5-0 victory where Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar both scored, sure, but where the right-back Sergi Roberto was the outstanding player in a collective performance that was nowhere near as good as the 5-0 score suggests, three of the goals coming in the last final 10 minutes and Luis Enrique calling it \u201cmisleading\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWho remembers Alves now?\u201d the headlines wondered, remembering Alves.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to like this position,\u201d Sergi Roberto said after he got his fourth assist of the season \u2013 as many as the Brazilian provided last year.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FutbolModestoEs/status/780031612989964288\" title=\"\">Sporting\u2019s pre-match Lord\u2019s Prayer</a> did not help them much and the absence of the man that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CDLeganes/status/775689956299792384\" title=\"\">Legan\u00e9s had called \u201cGod\u201d</a> did not hinder their visitors much, either. Barcelona got a good result that got better still when, a few hours later, in a different time zone, Ronaldo watched from the bench as Real Madrid lost a 2-1 lead at Uni\u00f3n Deportiva Las Palmas.</p> <p>Ronaldo had departed, unhappy, 20 minutes earlier. \u201cIs too much being made of it?\u201d one poll asked on Monday morning. The answer was of course yes (and it has dominated <em>everything</em> since), not least by Ronaldo himself: it\u2019s not like he tried to hide his irritation. He looked away as he shook Zinedine Zidane\u2019s hand, gave the delegate Javi Garc\u00eda Coll a piece of his mind and muttered his way through the next few minutes. The decision made sense \u2013 Madrid were on course for win, having taken control, Ronaldo had not played well and is still not fully fit, he knows he needs to be more conscientious about rest, and Zidane admitted Dortmund was on their mind \u2013 but maybe it backfired when Araujo scored an 85th-minute equaliser, his blocked shot bouncing off Kiko Casilla, off him and running towards the line.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a bit of luck,\u201d the Las Palmas coach Quique Setien admitted; \u201ca <em>bit?</em>\u201d came the reply. Marca\u2019s cover ran with \u201cREBOUND\u201d and called it a \u201cfortunate\u201d goal. Madrid had the chances in the second half and should have killed it, while the goal came from Las Palmas\u2019s only real opportunity. Yet that was not entirely fair, the dismissive tone even more so. Las Palmas are seventh and <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/2946527/las-palmas-the-tiny-club-revived-and-reborn-and-briefly-leading-la-liga\" title=\"\">their start is no fluke</a>; it is, rather, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/07/resurgent-las-palmas-la-liga-relegation\" title=\"\">continuation from last year</a>. They had more possession and while the deflection favoured them, the short corner routine that brought it was superb. Besides, why is it luck when it happens <em>to</em> you but never when it happens <em>for</em> you? It\u2019s not like Madrid\u2019s two goals had not come from rebounds, too.</p> <p>And so Madrid dropped points with a second draw in four days on a weekend in which Atl\u00e9tico won 1-0 against Deportivo but lost Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez for six months; the weekend when the league got even more interesting and a lot happened, from the Canary Islands to Catalonia \u2013 and there\u2019s still Alav\u00e9s and Paco J\u00e9mez to come. There is just one point from first to second and one more from second to third. And if the top three look familiar \u2013 Madrid, Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico \u2013 there are two teams level with Diego Simeone\u2019s side and just four points separate the top eight. It is true that it\u2019s only six weeks in, but Madrid have now dropped points to Villarreal and Las Palmas; Barcelona have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/12/alaves-barcelona-la-liga\" title=\"\">lost against Alav\u00e9s</a>; and Atl\u00e9tico have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/22/manu-garcia-atletico-madrid-alaves-la-liga-blog\" title=\"\">held by them</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/29/noisy-neighours-leganes-atletico-madrid-real\" title=\"\">by Legan\u00e9s</a>.</p> <p>They might have been held by Deportivo on Sunday too, but the truth is that, results apart, in three home games this season Atl\u00e9tico have played well each time and created loads of chances. They created plenty again on Sunday, with Koke central, Filipe Luis flying and Antoine Griezmann everywhere.</p> <p>And if they were helped by the sending off of Faycal Fajr just before the break for two daft yellow cards, this was also the weekend in which the Depor manager Gaizka Garitano and goalkeeper Germ\u00e1n Lux did not even need to be asked to insist that the red card which changed the game was entirely deserved, a bout of honesty as refreshing as it was unexpected; in which they sent on a late substitute, signed as free agent, named Ryan Babel. And, yes, it is that one; and, yes, he is still only 29.</p> <p>It was also the weekend in which Villarreal, getting better all the time, looked a bit like they used to, Nicola Sansone scoring a lovely third and Alexander Pato getting the first. Yes, that Alexander Pato. And, yes, he is still only 27. He\u2019s looking pretty good, too. The weekend, too, in which the Espanyol manager Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores said he was worried about his players\u2019 heads after they conceded in the 91st and 93rd minutes, the second an 80-yard run from Sisto Pione, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqfTZC6zhc4, chicken-whisperer\" title=\"\">Betis\u2019s resident comedian</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JM9LFyixVg\" title=\"\">and captain</a> Joaqu\u00edn ended up with a bloody bandage around his \u2013 but not before scoring the winner against M\u00e1laga with it, superbly made by Charlie Mousonda \u2013 and in which Salvatore Sirigu lost his, elbowing Aritz Aduriz to leave the midfielder Vicente Iborra facing a last-minute penalty at San Mam\u00e9s.</p> <p>Iborra didn\u2019t save it \u2013 no outfield player ever has in <em>primera</em>. So Aduriz scored too, just as Balenziaga had. Eibar\u2019s Pedro Le\u00f3n didn\u2019t. He missed a penalty that would not have gone in if they had stacked up six goals together, when his standing foot lifted a divot that lifted the ball next to it, lifting the shot over the bar, over the wall and into the street on the other side.

  "<p>The parents of the youngest child waiting for a heart transplant in the UK are hoping that the plight of their 19-week-old baby will help change the law on donor transplants.<br></p> <p>Marnie Brace was born with a serious heart condition in May, and her parents have been told that without a heart transplant she will not survive. Nick and Amy Brace are calling on the public <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/128473\">to sign a petition</a> to urge Westminster politicians to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/14/wales-deemed-consent-organ-donations-increase-transplants\">follow Welsh lawmakers</a> and create an opt-out organ donor system. Currently people wishing to donate their organs after their death have to sign <a href=\"https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/register-to-donate/\">the organ donor register</a> or inform family members of their wishes.<br></p> <p>Marnie\u2019s father said he hoped their baby\u2019s situation would move people to sign the register and lobby politicians for a change in the law. \u201cWe know that Marnie will die without a new heart, so every day we are waiting for a call. We are on tenterhooks, we can\u2019t sleep \u2013 it is obviously very, very hard,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut we hope that we can use Marnie\u2019s life to get the message across that the law needs to change, so we can stop other children and their parents going through this. Everybody you know is willing to give their organs, but the law doesn\u2019t reflect that attitude.\u201d<br></p> <p>Marnie was born at the <a href=\"http://www.evelinalondon.nhs.uk/Home.aspx\">Evelina children\u2019s hospital</a> in London after doctors noticed at her 30-week scan that her heart was not functioning normally. After the birth Marnie was diagnosed as having Noonan\u2019s syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \u201cShe gets tired very quickly,\u201d said Brace. \u201cIf you hold her, you can hear her working so hard so we can\u2019t really pick her up.\u201d When Marnie was born her parents were told to prepare for the worst, he said. \u201cShe has already exceeded expectations, she is a real fighter and a real spirit.\u201d<br></p> <p>For Marnie to get the care she needs the Braces have moved from Eastbourne and are living with their 21-month-old son, Jonah, at a <a href=\"http://www.rmhc.org.uk/who-we-are/\">Ronald McDonald charity house</a> in London. Friends have set up a <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/babymarniesnewheart\">Just Giving</a> page to help support the family, as both parents have had to give up work. \u201cLike Marnie we have good days and bad days, but we take it in turns \u2013 if I spend the day crying, Amy will tell me to be strong and that we will find a heart, and if she is low, then I will be the strong one,\u201d said her husband. \u201cBut I can\u2019t even put into words how amazing the nurses who care for Marnie have been.\u201d<br></p> <p>Because Marnie\u2019s heart is so tiny the chances of her finding a match are greatly reduced. <a href=\"http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/news-and-media/news-articles/news_2015_11_20.asp\">According to NHS statistics</a>, almost 49,000 people in the UK have waited for an organ transplant in the last 10 years and more than 6,000, including 270 children, have died before receiving the transplant.<br></p> <p>\u201cOur priority is to help our girl, but we really want people to sign the <a href=\"https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/register-to-donate/register-your-details/\">donor register</a>, sign the petition and share it,\u201d said Brace. \u201cDon\u2019t just like the page on social media \u2013 we don\u2019t need niceties, we need change.\u201d</p>",

With less than 10,000 sq km to go, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/mh370-search-decreasing-possibility-plane-will-be-found-say-authorities\">seems increasingly likely it will be unsuccessful</a>. But Gibson rejects the idea that he is doing a better job than the ATSB. \u201cThey\u2019re out there in 20-metre waves, miserable, cold, trying to find something 6,000-metres deep. I\u2019m walking along a beach picking things up after the ocean has done its work,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to compare the two of us ... and what they have the possibility of finding, which is the black boxes \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s the holy grail.\u201d</p> <p>In early September, he and relatives of the missing passengers met the crew of the Fugro Equator, one of the search vessels, in port in Fremantle, Western Australia. \u201cThere were choked-back emotions and tears from these tough guys out on the boat,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cThey really care, they\u2019re really dedicated, and I hate to see the media trash them, trash the ATSB ... they really want to find this plane.\u201d For the ATSB\u2019s part, a spokesman says Gibson\u2019s efforts have reinvigorated public interest in the search, and led to more members of the public coming forward with items.</p> <p>Gibson is less effusive about the Malaysian authorities, who he has found to be slow to retrieve potential evidence. But \u201cmore frustrating\u201d are people, particularly journalists, who cherrypick evidence to suit their \u201cpet theories\u201d \u2013 of which there are plenty. \u201cSometimes it seems to me that I\u2019m the only person who doesn\u2019t know where the plane is and what happened to it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He singles out an Australian primetime current affairs programme that claimed in its \u201cspecial investigation\u201d that the plane\u2019s fuselage was intact under water, even though he believes he has found debris from the cabin interior. \u201cI was holding pieces \u2013 you\u2019ve seen the pictures. I\u2019m not under 600 atmospheres of pressure, it\u2019s not dark, I\u2019m breathing normally.

The story was authored by Jeff Wise, a high-profile but controversial commentator on the search for MH370 who has posited a number of theories, including that it was hijacked and flown to Kazakhstan on Vladimir Putin\u2019s instruction. But, says Gibson, even if it wasn\u2019t a stretch to interpret a simulated route as evidence of planning, to say the two routes \u201cclosely matched\u201d is just not true.</p> <p>The evidence thus far points to a high-speed impact that shattered the plane, including the main cabin \u2013 inconsistent with a controlled glide by a suicidal pilot.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing in the background of this pilot to indicate that he would want to end his life or everybody else\u2019s \u2013 nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only evidence against him is the absence of any other explanation.

A cyber-attack on The Hunt for MH370 website, after it published his report on the possible sighting in the Maldives, seemed professional, he says, although he does not know if his detractors are paid to discredit him, or \u201cjust mean people\u201d.</p> <p>He insists that he is driven only by the desire to find out what happened to the plane. \u201cThe problem with Malaysia 370 is there are too many theories and not enough evidence. I can tell you what we do know. The plane crashed in the Indian Ocean, somewhere south of the equator and north of 39 degrees south [latitude] \u2013 probably more likely north of 34 degrees south.</p> <p>\u201cIt did not crash in the Gulf of Thailand. It did not crash in the Bay of Bengal. It is not buried in the sand of Kazakhstan. It is not south of 40 degrees, because then debris would have gone to Australia and Tasmania \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t abducted by aliens.\u201d He says it is possible that there was an emergency that crew members tried and failed to respond to. It is also possible that the plane was hijacked.</p> <p>There is no neat narrative, which, he accepts, people find difficult. But speculation at least fuels the search.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as the interest remains in solving this mystery, I am content, because we need the search on until we do [solve it],\u201d says Gibson. \u201cWhat bothers me are the easy answers that cause us to say: \u2018Mystery solved, sweep it under the rug for ever, pin it on the pilot.\u2019 I don\u2019t like the easy answers.\u201d</p> <p>Gibson is hopeful the search will continue, in some form, beyond December. His investigation continues: \u201cI\u2019m hooked now.\u201d However, he believes governments, airlines and manufacturers \u2013 even those not directly linked \u2013 should play their part.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to solve this mystery. It\u2019s not just for the families, it\u2019s for the flying public, who need to be sure what happened never happens again. We need to know that when we get on a plane, yeah, it may crash, things happen. But it\u2019s not going to just disappear.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is a curiously grotesque image. While a tightly packed crowd all took selfies with the Democratic party\u2019s US presidential candidate, a sly photographer slipped around the side. The resulting view is unflattering \u2013 not only to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> but the crowd. They all have their backs turned to her while they hold up phones to take pictures of \u2026 themselves, with the blue-suited HRC in the background. No one seems to want a picture just of the candidate. It\u2019s a selfie or nothing. Meanwhile, waving and smiling, Clinton cuts an eerily isolated figure on her little stage, up against the wall, separated from the selfie-shooters by a railing, like a <a href=\"http://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2013/february/08/the-truth-behind-francis-bacons-screaming-popes/\">Francis Bacon Pope</a> in his glass booth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton-presidential-debate\">Hillary: here\u2019s what you need to do to ace the debate | Carla Sorey-Reed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cue <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/StephenMangan/status/780321160508628992\">jeremiads on Twitter</a> against our stupid, selfish, vacuous age.

We rage against social media, on social media, lament the selfie \u2026 on Twitter, a social media platform famous for restricting its profound essayists to 140 characters. Uh-huh. Yet there may be more to this picture than a grim revelation of the idiocy of our age. It may not quite be the hellish vision of democracy\u2019s death in the echo chamber of digital self-regard that it superficially appears to be.</p> <p>At least I hope so, because Hillary Rodham Clinton is currently the last best hope for western civilisation, the final wall against the coming Age of Trump. If the image this picture seems to present is true, we\u2019re all damned. Looking lost and ignored as people turn their backs on her to preserve their own faces for posterity \u2013 me with that politician! \u2013 the only sane choice in the 2016 US presidential election is visibly lost in trivial-mindedness. What hope of getting her arguments across if the crowd is too distracted by selfies to listen? And if the criterion of victory is going to be celebrity impact in a low-attention-span culture, the horrific truth shows its orange face: in a race to the bottom of modern culture, Trump cannot lose.</p> <p>Yet this picture may not be as bleak a comment on the modern world as all that. It takes a side-view that reveals the comedy of contemporary mores \u2013 but are these people really behaving so very badly? Imagine a photograph of the same scene taken from a different angle, facing the crowd of selfie-seekers full-on. It might be rather moving and impressive. It would show Hillary Clinton in the distance, with a mass of admirers who all face the camera as they take their pictures with her.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/millennials-presidential-debate-trump-hillary-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54cce\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2745023\"            data-video-name=\"What millennials want to hear from the first presidential debate \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e57a1fe4b03598d1ce7f96\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/23/160922hofstra_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/23/160922hofstra.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/23/160922hofstra_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/millennials-presidential-debate-trump-hillary-clinton-video\">What millennials want to hear from the first presidential debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>For who are we actually seeing here?

At the Labour party conference, people are reportedly queueing up to have selfies with Jeremy Corbyn and other heroes of the hour. I myself treasure my selfie with Len McCluskey.</p> <p>The same thing is going on here. Taking a selfie has now become the natural way for many people to mark important events, from dates to nights out to weddings \u2013 why not great political moments as well?

Every single photographer in that crowd may be a PhD in political theory who is taking a selfie ironically to send to fellow faculty members at Princeton. In a culture that licenses and promotes stupid acts you can\u2019t assume everyone who goes along with convention is stupid, let alone a coldhearted narcissist.</p> <p>We won\u2019t know the truth about this picture, and about our time, until the US election results are in. This American election may produce hell or hope. It may leave the entire world in the grip of a very dangerous man, or it may mean that the US gets its first female president to follow its first black president. Our digital age is also being tested. Has the escalation of social media, including the endless sharing of selfies, degraded and destroyed proper political debate? Is the echo chamber of sharing similar views on Twitter and Facebook empowering monsters to destroy democracy?</p> <p>If that is the apocalyptic truth of our age, this picture is an allegory of it. As they concentrate on sharing their selfies with their friends, these people turn their backs on reality. But maybe it\u2019s not that bad.

  "<p>The UK has put its name to a call at the UN this week to set up an independent mission to report on human rights abuses in Yemen. </p> <p>The proposal, which marks a shift in British policy, is due to be voted on at the UN human rights council in Geneva this week and has been welcomed by human rights campaigners, even if it stops short of what some had been seeking.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia intervened in March 2015 to support the Yemeni government against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/19/understanding-houthi-motives-complicated-essential-yemen-future\">Iran-backed Houthi rebels</a> in control of the capital, Sana\u2019a. Earlier this month the Guardian published data indicating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/third-of-saudi-airstrikes-on-yemen-have-hit-civilian-sites-data-shows\">more than a third of air raids by the Saudi-led coalition had hit civilian sites</a>. The Houthis are also accused of repeated human rights violations including the use of landmines and indiscriminate shelling.</p> <p>The wording of the draft resolution suggests the UK for the first time accepts the need for international experts to monitor human rights abuses in Yemen, and to report on them to the UN human rights commissioner. The resolution is also substantially tougher than rival proposals put forward for debate at the human rights council by Arab states.</p> <p>The draft resolution, sponsored by the Netherlands, requests the commissioner \u201cto dispatch a mission, with assistance from relevant experts, to monitor and report on the situation of human rights in Yemen, on violations and abuses thereof since September 2014, and to collect and preserve information in order to establish the facts and circumstances of such violations and abuses\u201d.</p> <p>The Dutch draft resolution calls on the inquiry team to provide an oral update of its findings to the next meeting of the human rights council and then to report in writing to the council at the session after that. The 47 members of the human rights council will vote on the motion on Thursday or Friday, but there is likely to be horse trading behind closed doors before the vote.</p> <p>The resolution has the support of 22 EU member states including France, Germany, Italy and Slovakia.</p> <p>John Fisher, advocacy director at Human Rights Watch in Geneva, said the EU-sponsored resolution \u201cstops short of a full international independent inquiry, but should be supported since it provides for international scrutiny reporting to the UN human rights commissioner. It is a key test of the UK\u2019s commitment to human rights and its claim to have a seat on the human rights council that they continue to support this resolution.\u201d</p> <p>Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, advocacy director at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said: \u201cWhat has remained in Yemen since the Saudi-led coalition began its bombardment is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. The UN\u2019s credibility hangs in the balance and this resolution should be supported.\u201d</p> <p>The UK has previously said that it is not against an independent inquiry in principle, but nonetheless voted to reject one when the same issue was raised at last year\u2019s human rights council. The UN instead voted for the appointment of a Yemeni national commission, but the UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein concluded in August that the national commission was \u201cunable to implement its mandate in accordance with international standards\u201d.</p> <p>Since then, the death toll has mounted in Yemen and three select committees in the UK parliament have called for an inquiry in the wake of allegations of human rights abuses by both sides in the 18 month-long civil war. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has also expressed his concern, but appeared dubious about the need for such a probe.</p> <p>Britain is supplying weapons to the Saudi air force, and has a role in advising the Saudi-led coalition on its air campaign in Yemen. The precise extent of the UK military advice to the Saudi air force has been unclear. </p> <p>UK Foreign Office ministers have frequently in public expressed their frustration at the slow pace at which the Saudis conducted their own inquiries into allegations that its bombing raids have either targeted civilians or repeatedly struck them.</p>",

  "<p></p> <p>There is a simple reason why there is always trouble in Nakhon Phanom. It is the reason why the US air force came here during the Vietnam war, and the reason why this dull and dusty town in north-east Thailand now serves as a primary gateway on the global animal trafficking highway. It is all to do with geography.</p> <p>Nakhon Phanom, population 30,000, sits on the western bank of the Mekong river and is directly opposite the shortest route across Laos, on the other side of the river, and into Vietnam.</p> <p>For the US air force it was the closest allied territory to Hanoi, 380km (236 miles) away as the bomber flies. For the wildlife traffickers, it is the perfect place for business. To the west, Thailand has some of the best air and sea connections in South East Asia; and to the east, across the narrow strip of Laos, are the markets of Vietnam and China, bursting with the wealth of their new economies and hungry for the flesh, skin, claws and bones of exotic wildlife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/wildlife-trafficking-network/giv-1406nXN0sgoCEN4t/\" data-alt=\"The trafficking network\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/wildlife-trafficking-network/giv-1406nXN0sgoCEN4t/\">The trafficking network</a> </figure>  <p>Today the Guardian exposes the crime family that controls this gateway. And we name three mainstream Lao companies with powerful political connections as leading brokers in the global trafficking of wildlife. Together with other suppliers they have been trading many tonnes of elephant tusk, rhino horn and lion bone from Africa and truckloads of tigers, turtles, snakes, monkeys and pangolin anteaters from Asia. A substantial amount of their business is illegal. All of these traders earn a good living; the kingpins are millionaires. All the animals they handle lose their freedom; almost all of them also lose their lives. Some species are now facing extinction as they are shovelled relentlessly into this booming black market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/animal-trafficking-cites-criminal-industry-policed-toothless-regulator\">Animal trafficking: the $23bn criminal industry policed by a toothless regulator</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The investigation has been led by a counter-trafficking organisation, Freeland, which is based in Bangkok and has previously exposed key players in this trafficking network. But when law enforcement agencies failed to act, Freeland pushed deeper, working with a Thai government surveillance team, persuading some of the traffickers to talk to them and stepping round the corrupt public officials who guard the network to gather intelligence from reliable police sources in Africa and Asia.</p> <p>Freeland has shared its evidence with the Guardian in the hope it will finally jumpstart cross-border police action against this and other networks. Over the past year, we have followed Freeland\u2019s work, met key informants and the head of the surveillance team, and widened the investigation into other parts of the supply lines that link African bush and Asian forest to the plush new suburbs of Hanoi and Beijing. Told now in full for the first time, this is the story of the Asian connection.</p> <h2>The Asian connection</h2> <p>The secret life of Nakhon Phanom revolves around one crime family, the Bachs. Four wildlife traffickers, speaking independently, name two of the Bach brothers as the key players who control the smuggling gateway from Thailand into Laos: Bach Mai, known to his friends as \u2018Boonchai\u2019, 38; and his older brother, Bach Van Limh, 45. Although they are active in Thailand, the brothers are originally Vietnamese and have networks in both countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f665cfc93d9c2d7a2989e125da7fb61d2062eda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f665cfc93d9c2d7a2989e125da7fb61d2062eda/0_0_720_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Bachs\u2019 base in Nakhon Phanom.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bachs\u2019 base in Nakhon Phanom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boonchai runs the operation in Nakhon Phanom with a dozen men and a handful of women. The surveillance team has seen them meeting African wildlife traders, unloading meat from refrigerated trucks, loading cars with hidden compartments and delivering a package to local police. Bank records show Boonchai\u2019s girlfriend, who acts as cashier for the business, has sent money to Asian wildlife suppliers. Apart from the export of wildlife through Laos, Thai police intelligence reports also link Boonchai with the importing of drugs from Laos into Thailand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab7c54a5876eb00eb393eb04f62344ba0897fa6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab7c54a5876eb00eb393eb04f62344ba0897fa6d/0_10_720_928/388.jpg\" alt=\"Boonchai poses with elephant tusks.\" width=\"388\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boonchai poses with elephant tusks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His older brother, Bach Van Limh, runs the Vietnamese end, from a town called Son Tay, which is strategically placed just inside the border from Laos and a few hours by road from Hanoi. He originally set up the family business in Nakhon Phanom some 15 years ago but recently left, allegedly after Thai police started investigating his involvement in the drugs trade. In Son Tay, according to Vietnamese police sources, Bach Van Limh is involved in running prostitutes and in smuggling cars as well as wildlife. He owns a hotel, a cafe and legitimate businesses trading gold and placing migrant workers.</p> <p>The Bachs are key players in a busy market, buying from whoever will sell to them. Among numerous smaller suppliers, three Lao companies have been operating for as long as the Bach brothers. One is already notorious in the animal world: the Xeosavang Trading Company run by Vixay Keosavang, who has been hammered by a combination of policing and publicity, much of it organised by Freeland. But just as the Bachs, until now, have escaped public attention, so too have the other Lao companies. Vinasakhone and Vannaseng are big players \u2013 both breaking the law and both still enjoying one of the world\u2019s most destructive trades.</p> <p>All three Lao companies opened wildlife farms in the early 2000s. They imported tigers bred in captivity, which was legal so long as they were used for science and education, not for commercial trade. One of them \u2013 Vannaseng \u2013 illegally imported 2,000 macaque monkeys captured and sold by villagers in Cambodia, according to an internal Lao government report. All three companies went on to break international and Lao law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07b544c81b07f111b18b7598771286700724bc93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07b544c81b07f111b18b7598771286700724bc93/57_38_587_734/400.jpg\" alt=\"Leuthai Tiewcharoen aka \u2018Fatty\u2019.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leuthai Tiewcharoen aka \u2018Fatty\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At that time, the Bach brothers were already smuggling wildlife, primarily from a dealer widely known as \u2018Fatty\u2019, though his real name is Leuthai Tiewcharoen. He ran a farm in Nonthaburi, just outside Bangkok, where he stored and bred animals he had illegally smuggled into the country \u2013 tigers from Myanmar and Malaysia as well as bears, snakes and turtles. According to a source who worked at the farm, Fatty was earning 500,000 Thai baht ($14,400) a week killing these animals in a special slaughter area and shipping the carcasses eastwards to be used in food and medicine and as jewellery and home decoration.</p> <p>Sometimes, he sent them across the Mekong himself. There was a standard technique that Fatty and other Thai traffickers used, according to the source. The trafficker would go to a remote spot on the Thai side of the river, signal to a contact on the Lao side and drop a carcass in a sealed body bag into the water. The Lao contact would row over, haul the bag back across the river, weigh it and then make a phone call to send money to the trafficker\u2019s bank account. Some of these consignments would go straight into the farms set up on the Lao side of the Mekong by the three big companies. But, according to the source, Fatty also routinely sent carcasses direct to his best smuggling contacts \u2013 the Bach brothers.</p> <h2>The South African link</h2> <p>One day late in 2002 or early in 2003, Fatty came up with a new scheme. He had met an ambitious man called Chumlong Lemonthai, then aged 35, who had been earning a living selling fruit in a street market in Bangkok but who wanted to move into the wildlife trade. Chumlong reckoned he knew somebody who could provide rhino horn, originally sourced from Africa, and bones of big cats from the dry forests of central Thailand. Fatty set up a meeting between Chumlong and the Bach brothers at his farm, hoping to earn a commission as a middleman. At first, it went well. The Bachs brought with them a suitcase containing 40 million baht (about $1m), which impressed Chumlong. He agreed to supply the horn and bones. Then it went bad for Fatty: the Bachs cut him out of the deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"436546463470a551b3ceae2c4ecc062ea293f918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/436546463470a551b3ceae2c4ecc062ea293f918/0_74_700_420/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chumlong Lemonthai.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chumlong Lemonthai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chumlong went on to thrive in the trade and, apart from selling to the Bachs, he made a connection to one of the big Lao companies, Xeosavang, owned by Vixay Keosavang, who was to become notorious as a wildlife trafficker. From his base in Paksan, western Laos, Keosavang was sucking in animals from all over Asia and illegally churning out body parts at up to ten tonnes a week, investing his profit in hotels and a transport business. By 2005, Chumlong was having trouble supplying his customers from the dwindling sources of wildlife in South East Asia, and he decided to move to the biggest potential source in the world, South Africa.</p> <p>There, Chumlong rapidly made friends with Thai sex workers in the bars of Pretoria. Through them, he got to know white South African landowners who bred lions on their ranches. Chumlong commissioned the killing of hundreds of lions and supervised the boiling of their corpses to separate the bones from the flesh. He then parceled up the bones in ten-kilo bags - roughly one bag for each dead animal - and shipped them back to the Bachs and to Keosavang, who variously sold them onwards to Vietnam and China to be boiled and brewed as a cheap substitute for tiger bones in health tonics (although there is no evidence of its medicinal effect).</p> <p>This was potentially illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which allows commercial trade in lions only within set limits. The first two white farmers he dealt with had a licence to export a limited quantity of lion bone, which could be sent to Thailand under cover of official Cites paperwork. However, the evidence also suggests that some of Chumlong\u2019s lion trade was illegal. Often, he would have the teeth and claws of lions smuggled out of South Africa by Thai sex workers; they were helped through Johannesburg airport by an airline worker whose identity is known to the Guardian. In Bangkok, a corrupt airport official guarded Chumlong\u2019s packages as they arrived in Thailand.</p> <h2>The \u2018pseudo\u2019 hunt</h2> <p>With his lion bone business flourishing, Chumlong turned his attention to rhino horn, which was in huge demand in Vietnam after 2007 when a rumour spread that a government official had used it to cure his cancer. The international sale of rhino products is prohibited in Cites, but Chumlong and other Vietnamese traffickers now started to exploit a loophole which allowed hunters in South Africa to take home one set of rhino horns each year as a trophy. They set up \u201cpseudo\u201d hunts in which a willing stooge was paid to stand next to a professional hunter while a rhino was shot dead and had its horn removed. The stooge would then have a photo taken with the corpse and allow their name to be used on the paperwork to take the horn to Asia. There, instead of being displayed as a trophy, it would be sold and ground down for traditional medicine, although rhino horn is materially no different to fingernails and no more effective as medicine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f0c058e1883a594251c7b41a2bf5322ceb5aa5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f0c058e1883a594251c7b41a2bf5322ceb5aa5d/0_151_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lion bones are ground and used as a tonic in alternative medicines desired by wealthy Chinese.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lion bones are ground and used as a tonic in alternative medicines desired by wealthy Chinese.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chumlong started to import stooges from Thailand, paying them 5,000 rand (about $350) for their help. The Bach brothers sponsored some of these pseudo hunts. Paperwork seen by the Guardian shows that at least six members of their extended family travelled from Vietnam to South Africa to take part. Then in a neat money-saving manoeuvre, Chumlong substituted Thai prostitutes from his favourite bar in Pretoria, who played the same role for him without the cost of the international air fare. In this way, Chumlong arranged the killing of dozens of rhinos, earning himself $20,000 a time for their horns, which were shipped back to Keosavang and the Bachs.</p> <p>All this was illegal, though the pseudo hunts gave him the bogus protection of Cites paperwork for their export as trophies. The evidence suggests that Chumlong was also trafficking rhino horn from poachers, whose killing of rhinos in southern Africa escalated fast from 2008 as the demand from Vietnam and China increased. By this time, Chumlong, the former street trader, had bought himself two new houses in Bangkok.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/ivory_prices-zip/giv-140668ah2gcJJjDl/\" data-alt=\"High profit margins\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/ivory_prices-zip/giv-140668ah2gcJJjDl/\">High profit margins</a> </figure>  <p>In June 2011, following work by Freeland and a Johannesburg private investigator called Paul O\u2019Sullivan, Chumlong Lemtongthai was arrested by South African revenue officers in a high-profile operation. They seized his laptop, which contained commercial records and photographs recording the death of hundreds of animals and the despatch to Asia of millions of dollars worth of ivory, lion bone, and rhino horn.</p> <p>During one six-month period, the laptop documents revealed, Chumlong had paid a total of $1,394,282.40 to a white South African hunter who was shooting rhinos in his pseudo hunts. The same documents show that Chumlong was paying $6,500 per kg for the horn \u2013 a tenth of the end-user price in China, meaning that for that six-month period his rhino traffic alone was potentially worth $13.9m to those involved. Invoices also revealed the rate at which he was commissioning the death of lions: 327 of them during one two-year period, roughly one every couple of days, for which he personally received some $350,000.</p> <h2>A kingpin falls, but the trade continues</h2> <p>In November 2012, a South African court jailed Chumlong for 40 years, though this was reduced to 13 years on appeal. Bach Van Limh tried to save him, offering $600,000 to a key official in Johannesburg to release him. Chumlong has since claimed that the official was willing to accept the bribe if his money could be paid into an offshore account, but that this alarmed Bach Van Limh, who feared that with no record of the payment, the official would renege on the deal. So Chumlong stayed behind bars.</p> <p>Keosavang was hit hard by the documents in Chumlong\u2019s laptop. A combination of publicity and pressure from the US government finally forced him to step back in early 2014. At the time, his fall was celebrated as a turning point; the removal of the kingpin from the global machine. But when Freeland followed up on their investigation, they found that the Asian connection was as busy as ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71ae0a98074caa2c57a10458578df401258e937a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71ae0a98074caa2c57a10458578df401258e937a/0_44_768_461/500.jpg\" alt=\"A rhino mutilated by poachers for its horn.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rhino mutilated by poachers for its horn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They started to focus on the Bach brothers, who had not been exposed, realising that they were key players. It emerged that Keosavang was not the only kingpin, that the other two Lao companies had been working alongside him for years and were still busy.</p> <p>The Guardian has reviewed compelling evidence that since Keosavang\u2019s decline, Vinasakhone and Vannaseng have been involved in the illegal trafficking of hundreds of tonnes of wildlife from Africa as well as Asia, following the same route used by Keosavang and the Bachs, through Laos and into Vietnam and China. During 2014 \u2013 the first year after Keosavang\u2019s departure \u2013 the evidence suggests that between them they traded $45m of animal body parts including derivatives from three iconic endangered species: tigers, rhinos and elephants. </p> <p>Other evidence separately suggests that both companies have been breaking the law on the farms they opened in Laos in 2002; that Vinasakhone has been illegally killing and selling tigers to order for buyers in Vietnam and China and also selling tigers to the notorious Golden Triangle area on Laos\u2019s borders with Myanmar and Thailand where they are sold as meat, drink and decorative skins; and that Vannaseng, on one of its farms, has been breaching Cites by trafficking hundreds of tigers and bears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a8419ee02f5e9c52d30c1fc03fec21b2c970ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a8419ee02f5e9c52d30c1fc03fec21b2c970ae3/62_129_634_380/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boonchai, Keosavang and Bach Van Limh pictured together on holiday.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boonchai, Keosavang and Bach Van Limh pictured together on holiday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keosavang himself is not known to have been directly involved in wildlife trafficking since 2014.

The team have photographed multiple visits by two South African lion bone merchants with whom Chumlong was working. They have also identified one of Boonchai\u2019s men as a Thai courier, known as \u2018Jimmy\u2019, who was caught at Johannesburg airport after Chumlong\u2019s arrest and convicted of attempting to bring undeclared cash into the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ec614d22b2639cfbf3363a90b1af7001243bad3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec614d22b2639cfbf3363a90b1af7001243bad3b/166_12_379_473/379.jpg\" alt=\"Jay Daoreung Chaimat.\" width=\"379\" height=\"473\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jay Daoreung Chaimat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thai police have traced a sequence of payments from the Bachs to other animal dealers including a 40-year-old Thai woman, Jay Daoreung Chaimat, whose \u201czoo\u201d was raided by Thai police in 2010. She was married to a police officer and was said to have other good police contacts. After the raid, she travelled to Bangkok and lobbied senior officials to sack the officer who had organised it. Following an inquiry by the Thai Anti Money Laundering Organisation, Amlo, a court in May 2014 ordered her to hand over $35.6m as the proceeds of crime. This year the order was revoked. Her Facebook page displays a photo of her smiling over a basket full of cash.</p> <p>In a town with few sources of wealth, the surveillance teams have identified warehouses, apartment buildings and a nightclub as Bach properties and videoed the Bachs and their men driving a fleet of new high-end vehicles, some of which have had their licence plates changed.

Each poem appears in two translations exemplifying different approaches: set out on facing pages, the pairs comprise what Leighton describes as, first, \u201ca fairly strict rendering, which conveys the sense and syntax, line by line, but loses, in the process, the rhythm of poetry\u201d and \u201ca free version which takes the original and [is] part interpretation, part variation on a theme.\u201d The titles are not numbered in the text.</p> <p> The Sicilian writer and politician <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-Sciascia\">Leonardo Sciascia</a> produced two collections of poetry during his career. <em>La Sicilia, il suo cuore</em> (1952) was a response to the suicide of his younger brother four years earlier. Leighton\u2019s Note on the Translations gives us a vivid impression of the sulphuric landscape of Sciascia\u2019s birthplace, Racalmuto, the mining territory where \u201cthe classical resonances of the landscape, its antiquity in story, are mingled with \u2026 more recent connotations of a fiery underworld\u201d. Hic et Nunc makes us particularly aware of those \u201cclassical resonances\u201d, with its Latin title and vantage-point of \u201ca mutilated statue\u201d. Broken, displaced, the statue is a presence so strong it addresses us directly, out of the water and across time, an immediate paradox being set up by Sciascia\u2019s juxtaposition of the sunken statue and the title\u2019s Hic et Nunc (Here and Now). </p> <p> \u201cHic et Nunc\u201d (the tag) has been described as \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(H)#hic_et_nunc\">the imperative motto for the satisfaction of desire</a>\u201d. </p> <p>It may also have an almost opposite, theological dimension, and allude to the immediate revelation of the divine presence. More loosely, it could describe the poet\u2019s response to his/her material and the way language transports the past into the present \u2013 a meaning perhaps closer to the theological.</p> <p> The stricter translation (1) has the lighter texture of the pair, and at times seems the nearest in its music to the original. The feminine endings of the Italian are picked up by the first three lines, creating an impression of wateriness and airiness. The second translation emphasises solidity in its hard opening consonants, with <a href=\"https://allpoetry.com/Stopped-Dead\">a Plathian echo in the first line</a> that might evoke the cruelly abrupt, or insufficiently prepared-for, shutdown of the body in a fatal accident or violent act of suicide. The statue is described as \u201cmutilated\u201d in the original poem and the first translation, but the emphasis in the second version is on an abrupt cessation, almost the paralysis of rigor mortis: \u201cStopped dead, I\u2019m locked/in a broken gesture\u201d.</p> <p> The imperative \u201cLook\u201d picks up the stony consonants of \u201clocked\u201d and \u201clake\u201d and contributes to the insistent tone. The literary but graceful \u201ctrees enskied\u201d is lost, while specific details are gained, such as \u201cbird flights\u201d instead of \u201cquick flights\u201d. The qualifier \u201cOnly\u201d (\u201c<em>soltanto</em>\u201d) lends fragility and evanescence to \u201conly a tremor of things\u201d in the first version, very unlike the effect of \u201cwhat I see\u2019s a world reflected\u201d in (2). The \u201ctremor\u201d itself is repositioned in the second version, from line four to line seven, and becomes \u201ctiny tremors I cannot feel\u201d \u2013 a nice evocation of ripples and also, perhaps, delicate, undetectable soundwaves. Both versions avoid the phrase \u201cdelirium of time\u201d (\u201c<em>delirio di tempo</em>\u201d) but \u201cthe thrill of time\u201d has a shiver and shimmer omitted from (2).</p> <p> Leighton\u2019s free translations may alter the original structures. Here, though, the free version is modelled on its partner. This skeletal similarity sharpens our awareness of the contrasted textures of the fleshings-out, and the differences of vocal style. The voice in (1) seems, on the whole, more vulnerable and tentative than the voice in (2).</p> <p> While the free version initially proclaims stasis, it concludes with movement and mutation, with those \u201ctiny tremors \u2026 turning the nothingness into words.\u201d Because the noun \u201cnothingness\u201d is chosen over \u201cnothing\u201d, the assertion becomes plainer. Interestingly, \u201cnothingness\u201d is closer to the Italian (\u201c<em>il nulla</em>\u201d) than the \u201cnothing\u201d of version one, which is open to the negative interpretation that maybe nothing <em>at all</em> will be changed into words. Line six introduces <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyptoton\">polyptoton</a> to reinforce the sense of process and achievement (\u201ctime changing my unchangingness\u201d) and ends on an unambiguous note of triumph.</p> <p> Leighton\u2019s commentary on the translations concludes: \u201cBetween strict and free renderings, adherence to sense and adherence to the makings of a poem in English, I have tried to catch something of the original, even if only \u2018between\u2019.\u201d This idea of \u201cbetween-ness\u201d might be in your thoughts as you compare the two versions, and <a href=\"http://www.comunitaitaliana.com.br/mosaico/mosaico9/sicilia.htm\">look back at the original</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/29/poem-of-the-week-theocritus-villanelle-oscar-wilde\">Poem of the Week: Theocritus: A Villanelle by Oscar Wilde</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/29/poem-of-the-week-theocritus-villanelle-oscar-wilde\">Dost thou remember Sicily?</a> The Sicily of Theocritus and Oscar Wilde?

  "<p>Poor Douglas Carswell. On Twitter last week he confused the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon and got crushed by the far stronger forces of social media.</p> <p>It all happened so quickly. To illustrate the point that Britain trades more with its near neighbours in Europe than larger but more distant economies such as the US or China, <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/16479\">Paul Nightingale</a>, professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, tweeted a gravitational analogy that drew a brisk response from Carswell:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DouglasCarswell/status/777610290502524929\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nightingale_P\">@Nightingale_P</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon\">@DuncanWeldon</a> actually it&#39;s the gravitational pull of the sun.

An <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=askcarswell&amp;src=typd\">#AskCarswell hashtag</a> soon popped up to poke further fun at the member for Clacton and the story was gleefully <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/douglas-carswell-tides-ukip-experts-science-mp-a7318461.html\">picked up by the press</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Jeremy1Hunt/status/778272793943212032\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AskCarswell?src=hash\">#AskCarswell</a> Why are OUR tides controlled by unaccountable (heavenly) bodies OUTSIDE THE UK?

In the eyes of many Carswell already has a difficult relationship with facts, revealed by his loud insistence during the referendum campaign that the UK would be better off to the tune of \u00a3350m a week if it left the EU, a claim repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/uk-statistics-chief-vote-leave-350m-figure-misleading\">debunked by the head of the UK Statistics Authority</a>. He had also been patronising in responding to the Sussex professor, <a href=\"surprised%20head%20of%20Science%20research%20at%20a%20university%20refutes%20idea%20sun's%20gravity%20causes%20tides.\">expressing surprise</a> that the \u201chead of Science research at a university refutes idea sun\u2019s gravity causes tides\u201d. Yet it\u2019s also true that Carswell was less wrong than many people realised. One tweeter pointed out that the sun\u2019s gravitational influence on the tides is actually <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tide.html\">about 40% that of the moon\u2019s</a>, which was news to me \u2014 and I have a degree in physics. </p> <p>Judging from his timeline, Carswell has so far admitted no scientific error. Instead he tried to move the conversation back to trade and Brexit (though even here, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nightingale_p/status/777777622365401088\">weight of evidence appears to be on Nightingale\u2019s side</a>). I suspect he was mildly embarrassed by the faux pas but felt little desire to acknowledge as much before the sneering chorus on Twitter. Why expose yourself to further mockery? But I\u2019m speculating here \u2013 I\u2019ve never met Carswell so don\u2019t really know what makes him tick. </p> <p>Today, the incident is largely forgotten. Just another twitterstorm in a teacup. But the trouble is that this is how it goes day after day on social media. Thanks to the internet, communication far beyond our real life social circles has never been easier but it\u2019s hard to escape the impression that the quality of our public discourse has never been poorer. Carswell\u2019s gravitational spat may pale beside the pervasive currents of misogyny, racism, homophobia, antisemitism and islamophobia that wash daily across the online world, but the descent into mockery and vitriol is all too rapid, whatever the topic. When was the last time you saw an enlightening exchange between a Corbynista and a Blairite?</p> <p>What is it about life online that unleashes our inner demons? We seem to have made a leap in technology for which evolution, in its blind stumbling, has not prepared us. Most likely it is another <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect\">distancing effect</a>, this time due to computerisation. We might now be able to connect with half the world but we do so from behind a keyboard. The faces \u2013 and the humanity \u2013 of the people that we interact with are easily lost in the rapid fire of typed exchanges. It is little wonder that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/jul/25/vital-question-lifes-greatest-secret-reviewed\">some newspapers are closing down their comment threads</a>. Though this may partly be for economic reasons, it is surely also an acknowledgement that they add little to public debate.</p> <p>I\u2019ve succumbed myself from time to time \u2013 and in these pages. I have on occasion taken exception to what I felt to be largely ill-founded critiques of science and scientists by the Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins, and responded with outrage, with mockery and with facts. But after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/jun/10/scientists-human-as-simon-jenkins\">the latest exchange</a>, I paused to re-consider. It might have been cathartic to vent my frustration and then to be cheered from the sidelines by friends and followers (almost all of them of a scientific stripe), but to what real end? We just seemed to be talking past one another. </p> <p>So I tried a different tack. I bought a copy of one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/jul/25/vital-question-lifes-greatest-secret-reviewed\">my favourite popular science books</a> (Matthew Cobb\u2019s Life\u2019s Greatest Secret) and sent it to the columnist with a conciliatory note, to follow up on the offer of buying him a drink that I had appended to my latest broadside. And blow me if he didn\u2019t email back to accept the invitation. </p> <p>A couple of weeks ago we met in a quiet bar around the corner from where I work and over a couple of pints of a rather tasty Kent lager talked about science, universities, Brexit, grammar schools, Northern Ireland, and the travails of online discourse. I won\u2019t go into specifics since it was a private encounter but, while we still might not agree on everything, face-to-face there was plenty of cordiality and common ground. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/22/the-web-we-want-how-do-we-make-the-guardian-a-better-place-for-conversation\">How do we make the Guardian a better place for conversation?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cTwo people who write for the Guardian had a drink and found that they agreed on some stuff? Big deal!\u201d Well, yes, I\u2019m skating on platitudinous ice and this is hardly an original point, but the meeting was to me an important reminder of how the human factor, so vivid in real life, is so readily forgotten online.</p> <p>It\u2019s complicated. Although anonymity is often blamed for online rudeness, it can also <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-psychology-of-online-comments\">foster participation and risk-taking</a>, opening up new opportunities for discussion. But how do we find the right balance between open, constructive argument and ending up in an echo-chamber? This question is at the core of the Guardian\u2019s laudable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/the-web-we-want\">The Web We Want</a> campaign. There are no easy answers \u2013 though some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/22/play-nice-how-the-internet-is-trying-to-design-out-toxic-behaviour\">experiments in nudging community self-regulation online</a> are showing promise. </p> <p>Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/aug/23/scientists-losing-science-communication-skeptic-cox\">scientists need to be mindful</a> of becoming trapped in tribal enclaves, whatever the provocation. On Twitter I try to use the mute button sparingly \u2013 only when the rancour gets too much. Each time I do feels like a defeat but I just don\u2019t have the time or the heart to engage with <em>every</em> dispute. And although it\u2019s not possible to have a drink with everyone you end up arguing with on the internet, I have resolved to try to imagine doing so. That strategy will make little headway with the out-and-out trolls or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-rift-vr-palmer-luckey-trump-shitposts\">shitposters</a>, but there are still plenty of people of good faith out there that I disagree with profoundly. Carswell may well be one of them. Should we happen to rub up against one another online, hopefully at least one of us can take away something positive from the encounter. </p> <p><em>The author </em><em>is a professor of structural biology at Imperial College and is on Twitter as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Stephen_Curry\">@Stephen_Curry</a>,</em><em> if you\u2019re looking for an argument</em><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vivosvoco.com/index.html\">Jonathan Harvey</a> was the focus of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://intermusica.co.uk/artist/Martyn-Brabbins\">Martyn Brabbins</a>\u2019 programme with the BBC Singers. Four years after Harvey\u2019s death, it provided a timely reminder of what an outstanding choral composer he was, who invariably managed to say something fresh and deeply personal, whether writing pieces still unmistakably rooted in the Anglican choral tradition, or exploring other faiths in works that made use of the latest musical technology.</p> <p>The centrepiece was the unaccompanied Forms of Emptiness, from 1986, a timelessly beautiful mix of extracts from the Heart Sutra and poems by EE Cummings that embraces several distinct musical and spiritual traditions simultaneously, whereas more modest works such as the early I Love the Lord and the very late setting of Edwin Muir\u2019s The Annunciation both seem to look back to the church music with which Harvey grew up. But there were reminders of his pre-eminence as an electro-acoustic composer too, with his 1980 tape classic, Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco, and the richly inventive Other Presences, for trumpet and electronics, in which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.musikfabrik.eu/en/ensemble/members/marco-blaauw\">Marco Blaauw</a>\u2019s playing was confronted by multiple digital reflections of itself.</p> <p>There was music by others too \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09fucPO31-4\">Britten\u2019s A.M.D.G.</a>, his rather uneven collection of settings of Gerard Manley Hopkins, and a premiere from the Flemish composer <a href=\"http://www.wimhenderickx.com/\">Wim Henderickx</a>, Blossomings, commissioned as a tribute to Harvey. The settings of Buddhist, Christian and Islamic texts are given a numinous electronic background and punctuated with trumpet solos; there are some enticing sounds but also too many cliched ones, though Brabbins and the BBC Singers devoted as much care to them as they did to Harvey\u2019s rewarding choral textures.</p>",

As Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based technology industry advocacy group the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC), points out, it is unusual for trade agreements such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/internationaltrade\">Trans Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) to take center stage in a presidential election.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What your industry does, if you can call it an industry, is bullshit. You guys don\u2019t know anything about communication.</p> <footer> <cite>Steve Jobs, as quoted by Obama's former special advisor David Axelrod</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Garfield said that the traditional axiom in policy circles is that \u201cthere\u2019s no parade for trade \u2013 no one talks about it\u201d. Yet both Clinton and Trump have declared their opposition to the TPP, while Trump \u2013 in a January speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia \u2013 said that he wanted to get Apple to start manufacturing computers in the United States again.</p> <p>So both trade and technology appear to be on the agenda, but what else do the tech companies want Clinton and Trump talking about? Public statements by both nominees on key issues, as well as their publicly available lobbying records, have been documented by the Washington DC-based Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) and its Opensecrets.org site, which together provide a rich trove of data about the issues major technology companies care about in the context of this year\u2019s elections. </p> <h2>Google: anti-competitiveness, labor issues and copyright</h2> <p>According to CRP, the number one technology company spender on lobbying is Alphabet, the parent company of Google. So far in 2016 (up to the last CRP update on 9 August), Alphabet has already spent $8.04m on lobbying \u2013 putting it on pace to spend a little less than the $16.66m it spent for the whole of 2015. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/google-lobbyists-congress-antitrust-brussels-eu\">Revealed: how Google enlisted members of US Congress it bankrolled to fight $6bn EU antitrust case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The top issues Alphabet attempted to tackle with that money were copyright, patent and trademark issues (a common item for all the tech companies on the list), labor, antitrust and workplace issues, consumer product safety, science and technology \u2013 and homeland security. Yet some of Google\u2019s biggest government-related challenges lie outside the US \u2013 notably in Europe, where the European commission has alleged that Google\u2019s comparison shopping and advertising-related practices breach EU rules.</p> <h2>Amazon: tax, product safety and aviation</h2> <p>CRP figures show that Amazon has put $5.81m worth of lobbying services in its Washington DC shopping basket. The company used that money to lobby on issues around computers and technology, taxes, consumer product safety, transportation and trade. </p> <p>It was also no surprise to see Amazon lobbying on issues related to aviation, airlines and airports \u2013 given its involvement in both the use of drones and shipping goods by air. </p> <h2>Facebook: national security, intelligence and patent law</h2> <p>Facebook is the third-largest lobbying spender, according to CRP, spending $4.97m so far this year. And it has a lot of government issues to care about. </p> <p>Homeland security, intelligence, computers and information technology, copyright, patent and trademark issues \u2013 and taxes \u2013 make up the top five issues on which it has chosen to lobby. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/us-tech-firms-visas-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-immigration\">Facebook, Apple and Amazon to lobby next president over tech worker visas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amongst the bills on which Facebook has offered comment is the \u201cRequiring Reporting of Online Terrorist Activity Act\u201d \u2013 which the Washington-based Center for Democracy &amp; Technology criticized as requiring \u201call providers of Internet communications services to report to government authorities when they obtain \u2018actual knowledge\u2019 of apparent \u2018terrorist activity\u2019 on their services\u201d. </p> <p>Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has also been very active in lobbying for immigration reform.

David Axelrod, the former chief strategist and senior advisor to President Barack Obama, has a great story in his 2015 memoir, <em>Believer,</em> in which he describes a phone conversation with the late Apple cofounder, Steve Jobs \u2013 one in which Jobs appeared to be deeply unimpressed with political media consultants, despite Jobs having requested the meeting after a personal visit from then Senator Barack Obama to Apple\u2019s offices in Cupertino. </p> <p>Axelrod quotes Jobs as saying: \u201cWhat your industry does, if you can call it an industry, is bullshit.

Not surprisingly, its top five issues for lobbying were tied to taxes, copyright, patent and trademark, telecommunications, computers and information technology \u2013 and trade. </p> <p>The copyright issues are understandable given the huge legal battles that Apple has engaged in \u2013 most notably with Samsung \u2013 to preserve the unique elements of its products (a case is before the US supreme court this month).</p>",
  "<p>What will Lester Holt do when Donald Trump says that he opposed the Iraq war from the beginning?</p> <p>Holt, 57, the most-watched daily news broadcaster in the country, has been tapped to moderate the first presidential debate Monday between Trump and Hillary Clinton.

But he has shown persistence, in exclusive interviews with both candidates in recent months, in pinning the candidates down where they would rather speak unaccountably.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton supporters hope that means that Holt might intervene, unlike his network colleague Matt Lauer at a forum earlier this month, should Trump repeat his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/trump-fact-check-iraq-war-san-bernardino-nato\">lie about having opposed the Iraq invasion</a> from the beginning, or should Trump roll out any of the other 48 \u201cpants-on-fire\u201d lies that the nonpartisan group Politifact has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/comparing-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-truth-o-met/\">counted him telling</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhzRABE4Mqw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IhzRABE4Mqw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=119\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Trump supporters may hope that a different Holt shows up, one closer to the amiable broadcaster who co-hosted a weekend morning show for 12 years.

Any doubts about the calibre of his talent that accompanied his unusual arrival in the role \u2013 amid the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/19/brian-williams-matt-lauer-interview\">career implosion</a> of his predecessor, Brian Williams \u2013 quickly dissipated.

  "<p>You can\u2019t win an election with a debate, but you can certainly lose one. And with the polls this close, the candidates\u2019 task is not about preaching to the choir; it\u2019s about capturing that elusive 10% that will ultimately decide the election.</p> <p>There are nervous Democrats all over the country. I know because I am one. As a black woman with a black husband and son, I deem a Donald Trump presidency a very real threat to my lifeblood and livelihood. I also work as a speaker coach, and was part of a team hired to train podium speakers at the 2016 Democratic national convention. I worked closely with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Angela Bassett, Senator Cory Booker, and Governor Howard Dean.</p> <p>I\u2019m not advising Hillary, but if I were, here\u2019s what I\u2019d say to her.</p> <h2>The audience will be emotionally fact-checking</h2> <p>You have staff aplenty making sure you know what to say about your campaign platforms, policy stances, and social positions. But here\u2019s the catch. People can read the <em>what</em>. We\u2019re watching the debates to see and hear the <em>how</em>: how you interact with your opponent, with the host, and with us, the audience. We\u2019re emotionally fact-checking. What about you represents us?</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard it said that you\u2019re not a natural public speaker. But you\u2019re a good conversationalist, and you know what? Public speaking and holding a conversation aren\u2019t that far apart. Trust yourself as a communicator. Shrink the room.</p> <h2>Use the power of storytelling</h2> <p>In a memorable <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUV4Ha_Tf_4\">video</a>, shown at the Democratic national convention, you spoke of your mother being left home alone overnight at age four and walking by herself to a corner cafe to get food. You took your time, you allowed the details of the story to unfold, your emotion was contained yet visible, and through the natural pauses and silences of storytelling, you were able to transfer ownership of the universality of the emotion to the audience \u2013 all in 30 seconds.</p> <p>That story is the cornerstone of my understanding of who you are. You created something more meaningful and stickier than any sound bite \u2013 a story bite. Practice concise stories about yourself or specific individuals that you\u2019ve met on the campaign trail that you can share during the debate to dovetail back into your message. And a bonus: stories are very hard to interrupt.</p> <h2>Put Trump in a trick bag </h2> <p>At Trump\u2019s first interruption, turn to him and graciously say, \u201cI think the audience would appreciate it if we could agree not to interrupt one another. Can we agree on that?\u201d If he agrees, then you have successfully managed him. If he doesn\u2019t, he looks like an uncivilized bully.</p> <p>This one\u2019s a little harder, but it would be a thing of beauty if you could provoke Trump into putting his thin-skinned quick temper or flip-flopping on full display. Perhaps in response to a question about gun control: \u201cWhat kind of person brags that he could shoot someone and not lose voters?\u201d</p> <p>If Trump accuses you of playing \u201cthe woman card\u201d \u2013 own it! We want to see the \u201cgrace and grit\u201d that Meryl Streep referred to when speaking of you at the convention. Seize control of the game: \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, Donald, it\u2019s the hand I was dealt. I\u2019ve played it all my life, sometimes with long odds, which makes the victories won even sweeter\u201d.</p> <h2>Do eye contact \u2013 well</h2> <p>During the 3 October 2012, presidential debate, Barack Obama assumed he was off-camera and could safely study his notes while Mitt Romney was answering a question. Instead, Obama was televised non-stop on a split screen. That night, we learned that looking down, even when not speaking, does not inspire confidence. </p> <p>During the primary debates you occasionally fell into the trap of holding \u201cschool teacher\u201d eye contact \u2013 characterized by sharp eye movement intended to rein in an undisciplined class. Darting eyes crack like a whip and smack of an older, judgmental disciplinarian \u2013 a look that\u2019s probably not endearing to millennials. Instead, smoothly and slowly, first turn your head and your eyes will follow.</p> <p>Respond with your head up and with steady eye contact. In the primary debates, Bernie was a master at this. He rarely, if ever, looked down. If he didn\u2019t have an immediate answer, with his head up and eyes steady, he would first validate the question, then hedge with a bit of context while he thought about his answer.</p> <p>Looking down only rarely suggests humility or gathering one\u2019s thoughts.

But while we should perhaps leave the ethical considerations up to Colombians to decide, one thing seems obvious.<br></p> <p>If Colombians are interested in development \u2013 in social progress and more equality, better infrastructure, good quality schools, functioning healthcare for all, more foreign investment and jobs, rising wages; in short, in living up to their country\u2019s potential as one of the world\u2019s great 20th century success stories \u2013 then they need to vote for an end to the conflict.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/18/colombia-women-frontline-making-peace-last-ceasefire-grassrooots-activism\">Women are on the frontline of making peace in Colombia last | Yifat Susskind and Stella Duque</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Violent conflict is the nearest thing there is to de-development. Evidence <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/documents/Development.and.Conflict2.pdf\">has shown</a> that the more violence there is in a region or country, the less development. It is fairly obvious why. How can you set up schools and hospitals when there is a danger they will be bombed? Where will the doctors and teachers come from? And how can businesses grow if they are in constant fear of losing their investments, or having to pay off armed groups? </p> <p>No business means no jobs; no schools means no education. No development. De-development, in fact, because existing schools, hospitals and businesses may fall into disuse or go under. </p> <p>Of course, the relationship also works the other way. Factors such as inequality and human rights violations provoke grievance and lead to conflict. The social conflict that has divided Colombia into haves and have-nots for centuries is not about to miraculously disappear, but breaking the vicious cycle offers a chance for differences to be aired in political debate rather than mountain skirmishes, and for development initiatives to get a stronger footing in often remote areas. <br></p> <p>The danger is that post-conflict scenarios can also be highly violent. There has already been a demobilisation in recent Colombian history, of the right-wing paramilitary forces. But many are concerned that, rather than return to civilian life, many former members of these organised terrorist forces simply formed criminal gangs and continued to wreak havoc among defenceless communities, controlling not only the illicit drug trade but also many legitimate businesses and government positions.<br></p> <p>The end of civil war does not mean the end of violence. El Salvador and Honduras have proved that. Moreover, there are countries, like Mexico and Jamaica, where there has been no formal armed conflict in living memory, but where incredibly high levels of violence can often be just as antagonistic to development efforts.</p> <p>Perhaps it is time for a new designation to describe countries that have no formal conflict, but where violence is so rife that it seriously and systematically affects efforts to govern and develop. Violence-affected states?<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/20/colombia-city-of-women-safe-haven-from-violence-conflict\">Colombia's City of Women: a haven from violence | Sibylla Brodzinsky</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Assuming Colombia does vote for peace, there are three priorities.<br></p> <p>First, a huge peace dividend must be felt by all sections of society. Those who have suffered under the poverty and inequality that has accompanied the prolonged civil war need to feel this most. Then there will be the \u201cno\u201d voters, who still need convincing that a decisive rejection of violent conflict is the best way forward for Colombia, and who could yet stand in the way of a successful peace.<br></p> <p>Second, the already significant focus on improved governance, accountability and democratic institutions must continue. These areas have suffered greatly as people of violence have taken control of important levers of power. Only gradually, and with care, can corruption be rooted out.<br></p> <p>Finally, a focus on security is needed. The development sector has sometimes failed to appreciate the importance of investing in policing and security interventions. However, in a post-conflict situation where people are expecting less violence but the threat of more is just around the corner, security has to be a key priority. It is incredibly difficult to get right \u2013 especially as Colombia\u2019s security services have themselves been strongly implicated in corrupt and violent practices \u2013 but it cannot be ignored.</p> <p>For these reasons and many others, the international community will be needed more than ever if Colombians vote \u201csi\u201d. Rather than exiting the scene as though the job were done, international agencies \u2013 both official and non-governmental \u2013 should be doubling or tripling their presence and levels of investment. The history of Colombia and of countless other conflict countries shows that a return to violence of some kind is, depressingly, a likely scenario.</p>",

The purpose of the exercise, or so they calculated, was not to install a new leader but to take the shine off the incumbent. Mr Smith was designed, and in more than one sense, to be the anti-Momentum candidate.

The challenge has not diminished him; it has swollen the size of his congregation. The immediate fear of Labour MPs is that this will now be self-reinforcing. Mr Corbyn will further consolidate his grip on the commanding heights of Labour if centre-left members who have stuck with the party despite all the ugliness of the past year are so demoralised by his victory that they give up and quit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-election-result-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-appeals-for-unity-politics-live\">Jeremy Corbyn sweeps to victory increasing his mandate as Labour leader - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Examining the entrails of defeat, many who originally backed it now acknowledge that this was the wrong challenge at the wrong time with the wrong candidate. Mr Smith ended up as the anti-Corbyn standard bearer on the grounds that a relative unknown from the soft left \u2013 \u201ca clean skin\u201d \u2013 had the best chance of getting a hearing from Labour activists. His first handicap was that he spent the beginning of the campaign having to say who he was. He had barely started to introduce himself before a ruthlessly efficient effort by Team Corbyn had already defined him as a former employee of big pharma and a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d for Blairite revanchism. He largely positioned himself in the same ideological zone as the incumbent in the belief that this would be the best way to appeal to Corbynistas. That strategy would have been no more effective had he also put on a fake beard. For this invited and received an understandable response from that constituency: why vote for an imitation when you can re-elect the real thing?</p> <p>His claims that he would make a more credible and competent leader were undermined by his propensity to gaffe. One hundred and sixty-two of his parliamentary colleagues nominated Mr Smith. The more conventionally minded of us might think that, in a parliamentary democracy, it is quite important for a party leader to command the confidence of his MPs. Yet for those to whom Mr Corbyn is an appealing figure, it is one of his virtues that his parliamentary party are so hostile to him. Being the MPs\u2019 candidate was not an asset for the challenger \u2013 it was massive liability. I have talked to a lot of Labour MPs who spent time canvassing members. They universally report that many activists blamed the party\u2019s predicament and Mr Corbyn\u2019s abysmal personal poll ratings not on the leader, but on the mutinous behaviour of Labour parliamentarians. The depiction of the challenge as a \u201ccoup\u201d and the framing of the contest as Members v MPs, Grassroots v Westminster was toxic.</p> <p>So Labour is back to where it was at the beginning of the summer, with a vast chasm between a leader with a mandate from the members and MPs claiming a rival mandate from their voters. With this difference. Those divisions are now more starkly exposed, more deeply entrenched and more poisonously bitter. One MP speaks about \u201ctaking bodyguards\u201d to protect him at the conference. Another expresses genuine fear that fist fights \u2013 or worse \u2013 will break out in Liverpool.</p> <p>If there can\u2019t be a genuine peace between the two sides, could there at least be some form of truce? In his victory speech, a much crisper and more polished performance than 12 months ago, Mr Corbyn made magnanimous-sounding noises about wiping the slate clean. His campaign manager and shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, tells us that the party can move on from the venom that has flowed over the summer. \u201cWhat is said on tour, stays on tour.\u201d Even some of Mr Corbyn\u2019s most implacable critics know that it would sound churlish to snipe this weekend and have largely fallen silent for the moment.</p> <p>Beneath the surface, though, it is already evident that the party is as riven as ever. There will now be a struggle for control of the party machinery at both national and local levels. There is also the question, of importance to the country as well as to the Labour party, of whether it can become at least semi-functional as an opposition to the Tories in parliament. I can find some MPs willing to unresign and return to take on a frontbench role. Some will do so for fear of retribution in their constituencies or for careerist reasons. Some argue that the parliamentary party now has to make at least a show of being co-operative or the membership will carry on blaming the MPs, rather than the leader, when things go wrong. One of this tendency says: \u201cWe have to stop being an excuse for his failings.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/24/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-leadership-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54fx5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2746904\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn wins Labour leadership election - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e66580e4b0831a51401dec\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/24/160924CorbynWins_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/24/160924CorbynWins.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/24/160924CorbynWins_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/24/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-leadership-election-video\">Jeremy Corbyn wins Labour leadership election</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Others are prepared to return to the frontbench on the grounds that it is their duty to be a voice for the 9 million people who voted Labour at the last election and to provide an opposition to the Tories. Yet many say they will only do so if the parliamentary party is allowed to elect at least some of the frontbench. That would give them a way of returning on their terms and with at least some shreds of dignity. Mr Corbyn\u2019s circle sound extremely resistant to that. From their point of view, they have good reasons not to accept the demand. They don\u2019t see why he should agree to elections that would surround him with hostiles in his top team.</p> <p>Nor do they see why he should concede to the demands of the parliamentary party when he has just seen off its attempt to unseat him. The general emollience of his victory speech had a streak of menace when he warned Labour MPs \u201cto respect the democratic choice that has been made\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/24/jeremy-corbyn-leadership-win-shows-labour-is-now-a-changed-party\">Corbyn leadership win shows Labour is now a changed party</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With or without shadow cabinet elections, a lot of senior Labour figures will not serve in his team anyway. They say they cannot bite their tongues for long when, as they see it, the Labour party they love is being destroyed. They ask how it is possible to sit on Mr Corbyn\u2019s frontbench when 172 of them have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/jeremy-corbyn-loses-labour-mps-confidence-vote\">publicly declared him unfit to be leader of the opposition</a>.</p> <p>One thing they will now have time to ponder on is why their advice was rejected by the party. It might be convenient for moderate Labour MPs to blame the failure of the challenge entirely on the flaws of the challenger, but it would also be wrong. What the last three months have exposed again are fundamental weaknesses on the centre-left. Labour MPs often express dismay at Mr Corbyn\u2019s claims to be building a \u201csocial movement\u201d superior to his parliamentary party. They mock it as the politics of protest and a betrayal of Labour\u2019s founding purpose, set out in Clause I of the party constitution, to aim for power. The former frontbencher Tristram Hunt wittily despairs that his party is becoming \u201cthe political wing of the Stop the War coalition\u201d. They are right to say that there is a big difference between rousing rallies of the already converted and the harder challenge of moving enough of the wider population into your column to win a general election.</p> <p>Sound as that analysis might be, you can see why Team Corbyn are not receptive to lectures about electability from critics who can\u2019t win \u2013 can\u2019t get anywhere near winning \u2013 an election in the Labour party. Comprehensively out-organised by Team Corbyn and their union backers in last year\u2019s contest, the anti-Corbynites vowed to do much better this time. They have developed some infrastructure in the form of the groups <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/21/anti-corbyn-group-funded-tony-blair-spin-doctor-benjamin-wegg-prosser\">Labour Tomorrow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/anti-corbyn-labour-mps-plan-breakaway-group-in-parliament\">Saving Labour</a>. The latter claims to have signed up 120,000 new members. But the result speaks for itself. Momentum out-recruited and out-organised them. Labour has now become the largest political party in western Europe. That may say nothing about its capacity to win a general election under its current leadership, but it does say something.</p> <p>Love him or loathe him, Mr Corbyn \u2013 or what he represents \u2013 is capable of attracting and enthusing support. If they are ever to get their party back, his opponents will have to do the same. And they will have to offer a more enticing prospectus than begging people to join Labour to save the party from itself. They have again failed to beat Jeremy Corbyn. Perhaps the best thing Labour moderates could do now, strange as this may seem, is to try to learn from him.</p>",

There is some evidence to suggest that parent lobbies are becoming more protective, he added.</p> <p>\u201cBut librarians would argue that the best way to guide your children\u2019s reading is to read with them, and talk about what you read. For every parent convinced that a book is evil, there are two other parents who think it\u2019s wonderful. So you have the right to guide your own children\u2019s reading \u2013 but not to dictate or suppress someone else\u2019s,\u201d said LaRue. \u201cThe truth is, [these] issues are already a part of many children\u2019s lives, and suppressing books about them doesn\u2019t help anyone. In fact, these books may tell children that they are not alone, that what\u2019s happening to them is not unique, and it can be survived. The world can be a dangerous place, but reading about it makes it less so.\u201d</p> <p>Judith Platt, director of free expression advocacy at the Association of American Publishers, agreed. \u201cBanning books by diverse authors, or books dealing with people or situations that are unfamiliar or strange to the majority of Americans, creates fear rather than promoting understanding. Young people especially need books that shed light on a diversity of experience, background, culture, gender, and religion,\u201d she said. \u201cBooks that feature people of colour, people with disabilities and people seeking answers to questions about gender identity create opportunities for learning and openness.

  "<p>In the coming weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/paris-climate-agreement-poised-to-come-into-force\">the Paris climate agreement could be about to enter into force</a>. Action to meet the deal\u2019s targets of holding global warming to 2C is most clearly visible in the energy sector - where a low-carbon transition is underway. There is, however, one sector where, until now, action has been invisible owing to its exemption from contributing to the fight to limit carbon pollution: international aviation.<br></p> <p>Aviation is one of the top-10 global carbon polluters. The industry <a href=\"http://www.icao.int/Meetings/a39/Documents/WP/wp_209_en.pdf\">emits more CO2 each year than the 129 countries with the lowest annual emissions</a>. Worryingly, those <a href=\"http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/aviation-and-marine-report-2009.pdf\">emissions are expected to balloon by 300%</a> if no concerted action is taken sooner rather than later. In 2010, 2.4 billion passengers travelled by plane, but <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/pressroom/facts_figures/Documents/vision-2050.pdf\">by 2050 that number is expected to rise to 16 billion</a>. <br><br>The global agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\">reached in Paris last December committed the world\u2019s governments to fighting climate change</a>. Curbing aviation emissions is absolutely essential to fulfilling those commitments. However, aviation was conspicuous by its absence from the text.</p> <p>Aviation has, in fact, historically found itself in a parallel universe when it comes to the industry\u2019s contribution to the fight against climate change: it has made none. Airlines have been operating in a world where they pay no fuel taxes, are VAT-exempt, face no legally-binding fuel efficiency requirements, <a href=\"http://carbonmarketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Aviation-Policy-Brief_final.pdf\">and have no limits placed on their CO2 emissions</a>. But this could all be about to change and not before time.</p> <p>The UN body responsible for international civil aviation, ICAO, has been charged with creating a global market-based mechanism to offset the industry\u2019s growth in emissions from 2020 onwards. Transport ministers from all around the world are set to meet at the next ICAO Assembly in Montreal, from 27 September to 7 October 2016, and they must live up to their responsibilities. It is essential ministers agree a global market-based mechanism for international aviation that delivers carbon neutral growth from 2020 - with a significant ramping up of that ambition over time.</p> <p>Such a commitment to carbon neutral growth post-2020 would, itself, not be enough to fulfil the goals of the Paris agreement. And the current state of negotiations suggests that any final agreement will, in any case, fall far short of even that fundamental commitment.</p> <p>Worryingly, in a blatant attempt to delay vital action, <a href=\"http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2016-09-06-02.aspx\">ministers are set to agree that binding limits should not come into force before 2027</a>. Until then, two \u2018voluntary phases\u2019 of the scheme are expected, allowing continued and limitless growth in aviation emissions. Furthermore, the current proposals are plagued by a large number of unacceptable exemptions that are pegging back ambition. <br><br>EU Transport Ministers attending the ICAO Assembly have a duty to make sure the global market-based mechanism is robust enough to deliver on the commitments made in Paris. </p> <p>This means, firstly, ensuring the ambitions of the scheme remain dynamic, and under constant review. It is essential that the scheme includes guarantees on the environmental integrity of offsets, and that it prohibits double-counting and provides transparency on the offsets used. Secondly, the scope of participation must be sufficiently wide-ranging, and the wealthiest countries must take responsibility for their historical burden and pledge to do more to reduce emissions. </p> <p>Finally, allowing regional blocs such as the EU to take further measures to curb aviation emissions is an essential part of enabling them to honour the commitments they made in Paris, especially if ICAO fails to deliver. Under EU law, international flights to and from the European Union will once again fall under the block\u2019s emissions trading scheme from 2017. It is vital, therefore, that there are no attempts to water down this mechanism. <br><br>While the ICAO compromise is too weak to deliver what is necessary to keep temperature increases below dangerous levels, it does have the potential to deliver significant action if certain clauses are strengthened and the widest possible political engagement is secured.</p> <p>This is why we must all increase the pressure on our governments to make sure they reach an agreement in Montreal that is as ambitious as possible and finally shakes aviation from its parallel universe, forcing it to take a stake in efforts to tackle our common challenges. With a Paris deal coming into action, the world cannot afford a failure in its first global attempt to put words into action.</p>",

It was reported as being within 100 metres of the shore at 5.20am. Its engine failed at 6.40am and it was forced by waves on to the rocks at 7.10am.</p> <p>For the plaintiffs, Michael Cranitch SC played to the court a series of videos that showed the 30-metre wooden fishing vessel being tossed by waves closer and closer to the island\u2019s rocks.<br></p> <p>The videos showed the boat dangerously overcrowded, with passengers clinging to a mast in the middle of the deck. Those on board can be heard screaming as the boat is pushed closer to the rocks, and then overwhelmed by the spray sent back from the cliffs.<br></p> <p>Watching the boat in severe distress, one person can be heard on the video asking: \u201cWhere the fuck\u2019s the navy?\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is really bad on their part,\u201d another witness says.</p> <p>In a later video, the first voice says: \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, it\u2019s going to end in disaster.

A later phone call reports \u201cwe\u2019ve got a major catastrophe here\u201d, with a witness reporting the boat was \u201csmashing against the cliffs\u201d.</p> <p>The plaintiffs\u2019 statement of claim to the court argues that Siev 221 entered Australia\u2019s contiguous zone at 9pm on 14 December.

Recently, it has produced the curious conceit of the dual Instagram account; in which users have two Instagram accounts, one reserved for their close friends, and another for anyone who wishes to follow them.</p> <p> \u201cRinstagram\u201d and \u201cFinstagram\u201d, then. Account users have their real-Instagram (their rinsta) which has high follower numbers and offers a more polished and performative visual narrative. Think classic Instagram. Filtered selfies. Pleasing photos of food. Drink poised in air, quixotic rural or seaside landscape in the background. Their fake-Instagram (their finsta) is a second Instagram account reserved for their close friends. With low follower numbers (followers are usually kept in the low double figures), they use this account to share more candid pictures of their lives \u2013 often wilfully unattractive ones, pulling faces and the like.<br></p> <p>Users are mostly in their teens and part of their double life is to hoodwink prying parents. They\u2019ll allow parents access to their performative, public account; but the secret more ungainly account, (often under an assumed name) is kept under wraps, just for pals. This split online identity has found its way into the lives of people who really shouldn\u2019t have to hide their proclivities from their parents.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4690b66e5212a03f910fd2bc453b582ed7dfa829\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4690b66e5212a03f910fd2bc453b582ed7dfa829/0_48_3985_2389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"instagram on a phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wholesome, perfected shots are the hallmarks of a classic Rinstagram account.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.kimeastonsmith.com/\">Kim Easton Smith</a> is a freelance travel journalist and digital media consultant. Smith runs two Instagram accounts, one public account documenting her travels and another private account, which features images from her day-to-day life. She initially set up her public-facing travel account so as not to annoy her friends with smug travel shots and to \u201cshamelessly hashtag\u201d. The public account is very much an extension of her personal brand; targeted and strategic. Her personal account makes for a relief from that.<br></p> <p>\u201cI made the other one private earlier this year when I took a break from work. Before, I felt that as a journalist, I needed to have an online presence that looked cool and zeitgeisty; like I had my finger on the pulse. Eventually, I decided to give it a rest, changing my account to private, updating my profile to not say much about me.\u201d<br></p> <p>Smith admits she does think about how she looks on Instagram, putting it down to the permanence of the platform. While Twitter might be used for transient opinions or throwaway remarks, Instagram feels more like an enduring chronicle.<br></p> <p>\u201cI use it as a memory aid and love scrolling back through it, so I choose the moments I want to share.\u201d<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://nancyelizabeth.bandcamp.com/\">Nancy Elizabeth Cunliffe</a> is a folk musician who has always used Instagram to document pictures of her day-to-day life, curios that captured her imagination and updates on her music career. She recently set up a separate private account to specifically document a long hike she took across Spain.<br></p> <p>\u201cI may not want to share a picture of an outstanding paella with most of my followers, but I certainly want to record it for my memory\u2019s sake.\u201d<br></p> <p>As a musician, Cunliffe has a somewhat public life and so relishes the opportunity to keep some things just to herself.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to keep a little bit private in an era when it feels mandatory to share everything with people you have never met. My private account is more boring. I uploaded a picture of the gear in my backpack for my hike. That is pretty uninteresting to most people.\u201d<br></p> <p>A study conducted earlier this year determined three quarters of British people <a href=\"http://www.custard.co.uk/over-three-quarters-of-brits-say-their-social-media-page-is-a-lie/\">admit to lying about themselves on social media</a>. There have been instances of people <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/news/a52955/how-i-faked-a-hot-new-boyfriend-on-instagram/\">successfully</a> faking their lives, such as the Cosmopolitan writer who <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/news/a52955/how-i-faked-a-hot-new-boyfriend-on-instagram/\">fabricated an entire relationship</a> with a few carefully constructed photographs. Are we more comfortable blurring the lines of reality and fantasy online? What is perhaps most interesting about the Rinstagram and Finstagram phenomenon is how the public facing, performative account is deemed our real account, while the private, more honest account is our fake Instagram. Are we privileging our branded, public identities over our private, honest selves?<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1439507153b5d21bff92b6f6aaaa04365137d1f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1439507153b5d21bff92b6f6aaaa04365137d1f1/297_0_5291_3175/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mixed race young boy and girl making a funny face while taking a self portrait with mobile phone.

We do not always fully disclose. How we filter reality online is not that different to a conversation with a friend. Narratives of the self always contain an element of self-censorship.\u201d<br></p> <p>Cardo determines the performativity of Instagram less a false representation of our lives and more \u201ctechnologically optimistic\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are always performing. In every social interaction we are to a degree performing. We are constantly filtering the content from our lives. You don\u2019t tell a friend about when you went to the toilet. It is no different; just that Instagram allows us the control to more accurately perform an idealised life.\u201d<br></p> <p>Every image, Cardo believes, is a message \u2013 you are communicating something about your status and your lifestyle no matter who the audience are or what the intention is.<br></p> <p>Scope <a href=\"http://www.techtimes.com/articles/11232/20140726/social-media-make-people-feel-inadequate-jealous-survey.htm\">released research in 2014</a> revealing over 60% of people said social media makes them feel inadequate about their own lives. Does she recognise a certain pressure to conform to an idealised life? Is a private, less-filtered account of your narrative, your Finstagram, an escape from this? Cardo believes there are spaces for performance and spaces for intimacy online in the same way as there is during face-to-face socialisation. It is important, she thinks, to consider how we interact with Instagram and other social networks not as a platform for broadcasting, but as a tool for conversation.</p> <p>\u201cInstagram is an interaction and by simply following a person online we are actively participating in it.\u201d <br></p> <p>Does she see this dedicated space for communicating with our close friends as a move towards the humble, presumed virtues of social networking; that it is less about performing and more for connecting and keeping in touch with our friends.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere is a capacity for both to coincide.

  "<p>How does a company know what resources should be developed internally versus what should be handled externally?</p> <p>This question teases out all the meaty issues facing a company \u2013 past, present and future. It\u2019s not really the answer that matters so much.

We all want simple answers to problems.</p> <p>But getting this decision wrong can be very damaging. Hidden costs and other unknowns can make things take two or three times longer or many times more expensive to deliver. Also technology can evolve faster than implementation leaving the original decision irrelevant before the job is even done.</p> <p>John Allspaw is the chief technology officer at <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Etsy</a>, and author of two books about web operations. He says the build or buy discussion is a very important part of running a healthy business. \u201cThe best choice for the organisation is where the company is, not how featureful a product is. It\u2019s not a technical decision. It\u2019s a cultural one.\u201d</p> <p>While the question is crucial for all sectors it is particularly relevant to media companies and those who are dependent on the internet to run their business.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the digital world there is no sensible long-term strategy for owning the way media is delivered</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Customer data once seemed like a core asset and a good place to draw a line between build v buy. On one hand you might argue that your customers are your most important and most valuable asset and that you should never give away control of that data to a third party. But as the technology providers became more sophisticated the advantages of managing your own customer data became weaker and weaker.</p> <p>The notion that third parties shouldn\u2019t have a view into confidential business information evaporated as services like <a href=\"http://www.salesforce.com/uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Salesforce</a> and Google\u2019s Gmail improved, and once that happened hosted software solutions for every business function you can think of hit the market. And they continue to do so.</p> <p>If core assets and data control aren\u2019t the right vectors for teasing out the line between build v buy, then maybe a strategy can be formed around the means of production. </p> <p>Media companies decided long ago that delivering their web pages via servers they own and control was cost-prohibitive compared with the advantages gained by using a third party like Amazon Web Services, for example. Even the channels for reaching readers are getting outsourced, as social platforms like Facebook become so effective at getting a message in front of people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jul/28/facebook-dominance-journalism-world-view\">Facebook's dominance in journalism could be bad news for us all</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the digital world there is no sensible long-term strategy for owning the way media is delivered. </p> <p>Allspaw says that cost-benefit analysis can be a useful way to approach the issue because it\u2019s a universally understood way of thinking about the business. \u201cIt\u2019s not a software-specific thing. There are analogies in civil engineering and mechanical engineering. Organisations have the same discussion when planning for the number of engineers, accountants, or lawyers needed to solve a problem. It\u2019s a core function of running a successful organisation.\u201d</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean the build v buy decision is a calculation made via spreadsheets. \u201cYour decisions have to be fluid,\u201d says Allspaw. \u201cAt what point during the development in these projects would you know that you are doing the right thing? All decisions can depreciate like a car driving off the lot. The question isn\u2019t \u2013 was the decision correct or not. The question is \u2013 how often are you going to evaluate that truth.\u201d </p> <p>The cost of dealing with the decision in the future can help a lot in shaping the internal discussion. While some projects have a clear event horizon that make decisions easier, most do not and require constant evaluation. </p> <p>Understanding how willing the organisation is to veer its core activities off their intended path in order to get the most out of a third-party tool may surface the real costs of using it. And in order to understand the answer to that question an organisation needs to really understand what it is trying to do and have a way of talking openly about that and changing when it needs to.</p> <p>\u201cThere are parts of Etsy\u2019s infrastructure where we started using an external service, and then the service ran its course and we brought it in-house,\u201d said Allspaw. \u201cAnd then later we decided to go back out again and use another third party. The answer to the question is the largest \u2018it depends\u2019 ever.\u201d</p> <p>This is why the question is so important to the health of a company. It gets under the skin of the decision-making process and puts the organisations\u2019s goals and operations front and centre of the internal discussions.</p> <p>Build v buy isn\u2019t a binary choice. As Allspaw says: \u201cIt\u2019s about whether or not we are able to rationalise to ourselves how we made that decision.\u201d</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cBrought to you by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/25/content-funding\">here</a></em><em>.</em></p>",

Over their years of research, DRI has documented abuse within state-run, and donor-funded facilities \u2013 including orphanages and psychiatric wards \u2013 from the Ukraine to Guatemala. In the process they have exposed institutionalisation as a worldwide human rights issue.</p> <p>Last year, when investigating Mexican institutions for children with disabilities, DRI found \u201catrocious abuses that fall inside the definition of torture\u201d. Investigators recorded prolonged use of restraints in centres \u2013 like those in San Luis Gonzaga \u2013 that caused high levels of suffering, physical deformities and dislocations. Any restraint of people with mental disabilities \u201ceven for a short period of time, may constitute torture and ill-treatment\u201d, according to the UN\u2019s rapporteur on torture.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even in the best of institutions children don\u2019t get their full needs met</p> <footer> <cite>Helen Dent</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Paraguay, researchers found autistic children locked in cages at a state-run hospital. The children were only allowed to spend a few hours every other day in an outdoor \u201cpen littered with excrement, garbage and broken glass\u201d, as <a href=\"http://www.driadvocacy.org/strategic-litigation/\">DRI described it</a>. There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/mexican-women-mental-health-problems-pressured-sterilisation\">reports of forced sterilisation</a> of patients in Mexico \u2013 some pressured by health professionals \u2013 to cover up sexual abuse within an institution.<strong> </strong>In Ukraine, the teams discovered that children were given classifications depending upon the \u201cseverity\u201d of their disability. Children classed as level three or four were considered to be \u201cuneducable\u201d, and were expected to remain in an institution for life.</p> <p>Though the organisation has come across well-equipped, clean facilities and many families believe they\u2019re doing the right thing for their children, DRI\u2019s president Laurie Ahern maintains \u201cthere is no such thing as a good orphanage. Nothing replaces a family. Children still have psychological and developmental delays \u2013 you need someone to look into your eyes, a primary caregiver, and that doesn\u2019t happen in an orphanage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven in the best of institutions children don\u2019t get their full needs met,\u201d says Helen Dent, professor of clinical and forensic psychology at Staffordshire University. Dent watched DRI\u2019s videos from the institution in Mexico, and her impression is of a \u201cclean and modern\u201d facility where \u201cthe staff are trying to care for the children with apparently few resources\u201d.</p> <p>She adds: \u201cThe young man banging his teeth against the cot side was clearly in need of adult attention both to stop him from self-harming and to provide positive stimulation to remove the need for self-harm. Most people kept in such circumstances would suffer serious consequences and show unusual behaviours.\u201d</p> <p>The alternative, argues DRI, should be that development funding is moved to community- and family-based care. Their campaign is a monumental task that requires changing mindsets on a global scale.</p> <p><strong>\u201cThey were literally hosed off to be cleaned\u201d</strong><br></p> <p>It was after visiting the Samuel Ramirez psychiatric hospital in Mexico City more than 20 years ago that Eric Rosenthal decided to found DRI.</p> <p>With a slight tremble in his voice he recalls an area surrounded by barbed wire where both children and adults were held naked. \u201cThey were literally hosed off to be cleaned. They were fed on trays ... they all lunged for common food and had to fight over it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were tied down. It was the most horrendous dehumanisation. These people look like animals when they\u2019re left this way, and that\u2019s how they were treated.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfa7a83382a48e725b233e3363f52b0749f60f25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfa7a83382a48e725b233e3363f52b0749f60f25/1530_586_1379_828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Rosenthal, founder of Disability Rights International\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric Rosenthal, founder of Disability Rights International.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rosenthal, 52, studied both mental health and international human rights before turning to law. A lifelong activist, he strongly felt the rights of people with disabilities had been overlooked by the international development and human rights communities. DRI was established with a $20,000 fellowship in an empty office above a dance studio in Washington DC. </p> <p>The organisation bases its model on Amnesty International, researching and exposing injustices to push for change. Over the past two decades, Rosenthal has visited hundreds of institutions in more than 30 countries, accompanied by a team of volunteers who are often medical experts. </p> <p>The team is small, but they\u2019ve made some genuine advances over the years. DRI now has offices in Mexico, Guatemala, Ukraine and Serbia, and have produced 18 major investigative reports. An expose of abuse in one particular facility that DRI collaborated on with the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/16/magazine/the-global-willowbrook.html?pagewanted=all\">New York Times Magazine</a>, contributed to the historic 2006 UN treaty on people with disabilities, which called for disabled people to have the same human rights as the able bodied.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re exporting a model that we know is harmful to children</p> <footer> <cite>Laurie Ahern</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The organisation\u2019s work has also led to the European Union introducing a policy where European money cannot be used for maintaining any kind of institution. And in Serbia, DRI\u2019s efforts have led to a law that children under the age of three can\u2019t be institutionalised. Serbia now has one of the lowest percentages of children in institutions \u2013 though the number of institutionalised children with disabilities remains high.</p> <p>After the landmark UN treaty \u2013 the DRI focused its efforts on stopping new entrants to existing facilities. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to establish international law than enforce that law,\u201d Rosenthal says. \u201cIf we could get countries to agree on a moratorium of no new admissions to institutions, then they would whittle [the numbers] away \u2013 it would save families, save kids at the most vulnerable point in their lives. And that was Laurie\u2019s idea.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e2b6de2be4038dcabaac3156ef5c4f84a3e4a6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e2b6de2be4038dcabaac3156ef5c4f84a3e4a6a/0_697_2832_3539/800.jpg\" alt=\"Laurie Ahern, president of Disability Rights International\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laurie Ahern, president of Disability Rights International.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Laurie Ahern, 62, is the brainchild of DRI\u2019s global campaign to end institutionalisation. Rosenthal sings her praises, and when speaking to her on the phone from her office in DC, it\u2019s not hard to see why. Her passion for the cause is admirable. She cares deeply for her colleagues and seems to dedicate every waking hour to this campaign.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re exporting a model that we know is harmful to children,\u201d Ahern says. \u201cWhen I began visiting orphanages and institutions for children some 13 years ago, and witnessed unimaginable human rights abuses and torture perpetrated against children \u2013 left to die lonely painful deaths, immobile children left in cribs for years, no touch, no love \u2013 I knew we had to do something big.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that we can change,\u201d she adds. \u201cThis is really not a complicated problem; this is about donors putting money to families and not supporting orphanages.\u201d Other organisations such as <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/\">Lumos</a>, the charity founded by JK Rowling, also campaign for deinstitutionalisation, and Lumos has just launched <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/post/jk-rowlings-speech-special-lumos-gala-performance-harry-potter-and-cursed-child\">a global campaign</a> to raise awareness of the issue. DRI, Lumos and other organisations including the <a href=\"http://www.replace-campaign.org/\">Replace Campaign</a> all support the idea that we should change this culture of institutionalisation and work on keeping families together, supporting communities, and improving social networks. Lumos believes that the institutionalisation of children can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/17/jk-rowling-fairytale-orphanage-lumos\">eradicated globally by 2050</a> (backing this statement with figures including the 70% reduction of the number of children in institutions in Moldova over the last decade, despite the country\u2019s high poverty rates).</p> <p>There is also an economic argument, Ahern adds: \u201cIt\u2019s so much less expensive for government to support families to [help] children with disabilities go to school, than it is to pay to keep them in an orphanage for a long time.\u201d For example, in Tanzania\u2019s Kagera region, the yearly cost for one child in institutional care is <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/sites/default/files/In%20Our%20Lifetime_2015_Sept2015_0_0.pdf\">reportedly $1,000</a> (\u00a3770) \u2013 six times the cost of supporting a child in foster care. And in Romania, residential care for children costs up to $280 (\u00a3216), while family reintegration and local adoption costs about $19 (\u00a315) per child.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/13/concerns-unregulated-volunteer-tourism-industry\">Volunteer travel: experts raise concerns over unregulated industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <p>But in many senses they\u2019re fighting an uphill battle. Institutionalisation is still a development model \u2013 and in some countries it even constitutes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/13/concerns-unregulated-volunteer-tourism-industry\">method of tourism</a>, or voluntourism \u2013 supported by donors and governments.</p> <p>Money is a big problem. There is little or no funding for the services that can prevent family separation or for social care networks. Any funding that does come through is often used to renovate or reopen institutions, especially facilities for people with disabilities, rather than support the structures that can help replace them. </p> <p>Although 32 state-run institutions in Georgia were shut and replaced with family and community-based services in the last decade, a <a href=\"http://www.driadvocacy.org/report-documents-atrocious-human-rights-abuses-in-the-republic-of-georgias-orphanages-and-institutions-for-people-with-disabilities/\">2013 DRI investigation</a> found that US government money had funded two institutions specifically for disabled people, in the years since. Between 2008-2012, <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/sites/default/files/Lumos%20The%20Time%20is%20Now%20April2014%20FINAL_0.pdf\">\u20ac5.6m (\u00a34.8m) of EU funding</a> (pdf) was spent on renovating children\u2019s institutions and those for people with disabilities in just one county in the Czech Republic. Despite this investment, the quality of care did not improve and the Czech ombudsman still reported concerns over serious neglect and abuse in these facilities. </p> <p></p> <p><strong>\u2018When no one is watching out, bad things happen to children\u2019</strong></p> <p>But for Ahern and her colleagues there is no question of giving up. I speak to her just before she is about to go on holiday for three weeks \u2013 her only time off throughout the year. Can she ever switch off? \u201cYes I can. It\u2019s for my own survival and because I want to be able to stay and continue to do this work.\u201d She is going to spend time with her granddaughter, who is a poignant reminder of why she works with DRI. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine her going through what I\u2019ve seen other children go through unnecessarily. In recent years the investigations have become even more nefarious than I thought they ever could be \u2013 the trafficking of children for sex, pornography, organs. There\u2019s no way I ...\u201d she falters. \u201cI can\u2019t put that into the back of my mind and just let it go.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask Ahern about her motivation for the work, she says: \u201cI was abused as a child. I wish someone had come and rescued me; I wish somebody had spoken to me when I couldn\u2019t speak.\u201d Ahern believes that children left in institutions, especially those with disabilities, are forgotten. \u201cWhen no one\u2019s watching out for children \u2013 whether that\u2019s conflict or an orphanage \u2013 bad things happen to children. There\u2019s a sphere for abuse and neglect.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/20/we-need-to-stop-treating-people-with-disabilities-as-less-than-human\">We need to stop treating people with disabilities as less than human</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the most extreme cases of neglect she has seen was in the Tbilisi Infants Home in Georgia, where children with hydrocephalus \u2013 a buildup of fluid in the brain \u2013 were left untreated, which is extremely painful and life-threatening. \u201cBabies, six months old with huge heads were just laying there moaning. I was overwhelmed with grief because we know the problem can be taken care of and the child can have a perfectly normal life,\u201d she says. The NGO found more than 50% of the children with this treatable condition died in the institution.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see this and not be moved,\u201d Ahern says. She tells me about the time when, a few years ago, she walked into a Serbian institution to find teenagers with cerebral palsy who looked like children because they had not been allowed to leave their beds in 10 years. Worse, this was not the first time she had come across this situation.</p> <p>\u201cBut you can take action, get a little angry, and then you see change.

  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen\" title=\"\">Bruce Springsteen</a> first played London in November 1975, he was so angered by the hype surrounding the show \u2013 \u201cFINALLY! London is ready for Bruce Springsteen\u201d \u2013 that he stormed around the Hammersmith Odeon destroying posters and flyers. \u201cMy business is SHOW business not TELLING. You show people and let them decide,\u201d he rails in this compelling and often painfully candid autobiography. The night\u2019s performance \u2013 as ever, a barnstormer \u2013 sealed his reputation in a country he revered, \u201cthe isle of our heroes\u201d.</p> <p>Springsteen\u2019s epic live shows, habitually three to four hours long, are part of his legend, his triumph. Why he submits to them, even now as a sixtysomething, is a mystery explained in <em>Born to Run</em>. There is the joy of performance \u2013 \u201clife-giving, muscle-aching, mind-clearing, cathartic pleasure and privilege\u201d \u2013 and a work ethic inherited from his blue-collar New Jersey upbringing.</p> <p>Then comes the revelation of a deeper propellant, a profound unease that began in childhood \u2013 Bruce was nicknamed \u201cBlinky\u201d in primary school on account of his fluttering eyelids \u2013 and erupted into full-blown depression in his 30s, on the eve of 1984\u2019s <em>Born in the USA</em>, the album that brought him global stardom. \u201cMy depression was spewing like an oil spill over the beautiful turquoise green gulf of my carefully planned existence,\u201d recalls Bruce. In despair he called his manager, Jon Landau, who knew something of the problem and who told him bluntly: \u201cYou need professional help.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/12/bruce-springsteen-40-years-on\">Forty years on, why the Boss was born to run and run</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So began a lifetime of counselling and medication for a condition \u2013 one notes the recurring imagery of \u201cdarkness\u201d in Springsteen\u2019s prolific output \u2013 whose sure-fire cure has always been the dazzling stagecraft of heroic guitar poses, dramatic knee skids, athletic piano leaps and air-punching exuberance. \u201cExposed in front of thousands, I have always felt perfectly safe,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you can\u2019t get rid of me.\u201d</p> <p>Who knew? Certainly few of the millions for whom Springsteen has been a joyous, affirmative force, a man not without his moody, reflective moments, for sure, but to most eyes a model of dignity, whose songs empathised with the marginalised and the oppressed, and who defiantly sang: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrKh1zxv_rQ\" title=\"\">I believe in the promised land</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Depression was in the family, not in the exuberant Italian lineage of his mother, but plain enough in his dour, heavy-drinking Irish father, with whom the young Bruce had a troubled, warring relationship to which he returns repeatedly here, admitting that \u201cI was always in the market for a surrogate and appreciative daddy\u201d, a role that would be fulfilled by assorted friends and managers. There is a lot of self-knowledge on display here, and acknowledgment of the help and love he has received from fellow travellers and, most of all, from his second wife, singer Patti Scialfa, with whom Springsteen has three children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Later, he would learn to live 'high on the hog', but the belief in graft and self-control has never vanished</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Boss\u201d, as Springsteen is known \u2013 a name he dislikes and conspicuously absent here \u2013 has never shied away from interviews, and his 18 studio albums have been endlessly analysed and the inspirations for their songs located in a plethora of biographies. <em>Born to Run</em> adds little that\u2019s new, but its narrative voice proves insightful. Springsteen\u2019s high school years were spent forming bands such as <a href=\"https://brucebase.wikispaces.com/The+Castiles\" title=\"\">the Castiles</a> that negotiated a tricky path between competing teenage cliques \u2013 the pompadour and sharkskin-sporting \u201cgrease\u201d and the cheerleading, college-bound \u201crahs\u201d who populated the segregated New Jersey shoreline. The \u201csmall-town Caesars\u201d and \u201cgreaser girls with dive-bomber bras\u201d would show up later on Springsteen\u2019s early albums.</p> <p>First, though, came a rugged apprenticeship with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxyprIEfHqU\" title=\"\">Steel Mill</a>, a Zeppelin-style heavy rock band formed&#xa0;by an 18-year-old Springsteen once his parents had departed for a new life in California. Left to fend for himself, Springsteen became a \u201cfaux hippy\u201d, living in the concrete storeroom of a surfboard factory, too much of a control freak to do drugs or drink (\u201cMusic was going to get me as high as I needed to go\u201d).</p> <p>Later, he would learn to live \u201chigh on the hog\u201d, but the belief in graft and self-control has never vanished; \u201cwork\u201d is one of the most favoured words in his book. By his own admission no musical revolutionary, Springsteen worked at his craft, winning a contract with Columbia Records as a singer-songwriter, to be hailed as first \u201cthe new Dylan\u201d (one of several) and then, in a review by his future manager, Jon Landau, as \u201crock and roll\u2019s future\u201d. Springsteen is droll about this accolade but, as he came to see it, \u201cif somebody had to be the future, why not me?\u201d</p> <p>By the standards of most rock star autobiographies, <em>Born to Run</em> is neither sensational nor self-serving (you can forgive Bruce for dropping that Jack Nicholson called him \u201cking of New Jersey\u201d at Sinatra\u2019s funeral), with plenty of self-deprecatory digs and way fewer cars than in the songs. Springsteen has delivered his story with quiet dignity.

On Sunday the Northern Irishman had just completed media duties on account of claiming $11.5m on the outskirts of Atlanta when he was apprised of Palmer\u2019s death. McIlroy, like the rest of us, knew this was coming but was still deeply moved. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/sep/26/the-king-arnold-palmer-greatest-moments-pictures\" title=\"\">A sporting pioneer is no more</a>.</p> <p>Every player at the top level of golf recognises Palmer\u2019s role in their riches. Almost single-handedly, Palmer hauled golf into fresh commercial territory both with the late 1950s recognition of what television meant and a swashbuckling, risk-taking style which appealed to the masses. So, too, did a low-key background far removed from the snotty-nosed entitlement which has so undermined golf. Palmer, The King, was the people\u2019s champion. He transcended golf, just as he did generations.</p> <p>Palmer was the first player to earn $1m through on-course pursuits. By 2008, he commanded $30m via off-course projects. Palmer had a drink named after him, an unmistakable logo and was golf\u2019s maiden brand; a brand which did not just survive decades and playing retirement, it actually grew. For fun, the seven-times major winner was a pilot. His last flight was in 2011, aged 81, from California to Orlando.</p> <p>In this, a Ryder Cup week, it is worth reflecting on the emotion and inspiration which surrounded the European team in 2012 following the death of Seve Ballesteros. That had been four months before matters got under way at Medinah, which offers some perspective as to what will resonate in the hearts and minds of the United States players from Friday.</p> <p>\u201cArnold leaves an impact on the game and on sports in America that is unmatched,\u201d said Davis Love III, the United States captain. \u201cAs we approach the Ryder Cup this week, our team will keep Mr Palmer\u2019s family in our prayers and will draw from his strength and determination to inspire us.\u201d</p> <p>Palmer played six Ryder Cups, all marked by victory, and captained his nation to comfortable glory in 1975. This was merely reflective of individual brilliance. Palmer\u2019s professional wins totalled 95. Between 1958 and 1964, 25 major starts saw 16 top fives, five runners-up places and those seven triumphs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/sep/26/the-king-arnold-palmer-greatest-moments-pictures\">'The King' Arnold Palmer's greatest moments \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou inspired millions, you changed the game,\u201d said Jordan Spieth.

My own involves sitting inside his cluttered office at Bay Hill last March, conducting an interview as the legend\u2019s beloved labrador, Mulligan, lay at my feet. Palmer\u2019s health was clearly failing but his handshake remained firm.</p> <p>More notable was that unmistakable aura of greatness, the kind not common even among standard sporting royalty.

He spoke enthusiastically about a golf course project in the Highlands of Scotland, which will continue apace, thereby illustrating Palmer\u2019s business savvy even at a point where, privately, he most likely knew the odds against seeing it through.</p> <p>This year at Augusta National, in realisation of failing health, onlookers realised they were saying farewell to Palmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/07/masters-2016-arnold-palmer-nicklaus-player\" title=\"\">as he posed on the 1st tee </a>alongside Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player on the opening day of the Masters. But the truth, the admission of that, was understandably too painful for anybody to say publicly. Palmer donned the Green Jacket four times; between 1958 and 1964 he finished no lower than ninth at the first major of the year.</p> <p>The final words here should belong to Nicklaus, who may be golf\u2019s most decorated major winner but did not have anything even approaching the commercial savvy which set Palmer apart. \u201cHe was one of my best friends, closest friends, and he was for a long, long time. I will miss him greatly,\u201d Nicklaus said. \u201cHe was more than a golfer or even great golfer. He was an icon. He was a legend. He took the game from one level to a higher level, virtually by himself.\u201d</p> <p>Tributes poured in on Sunday evening but, primarily, the message was of thanks.

  "<p>A diagnosis of breast cancer can be frightening, and many of the <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/breast-cancer/about/risks/definite-breast-cancer-risks\" title=\"\">known risk factors</a> \u2013 genetics, ageing, being a&#xa0;woman \u2013 are beyond our control. That is why myths are attractive. They sell us the idea that there is something simple we can do to protect ourselves from cancer. We look at three of the most common myths.</p> <h2><strong>Your bra could be killing you</strong></h2> <p>The idea that wearing an underwired bra can cause breast cancer has been around since 1995, when <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dressed-Kill-between-Breast-Cancer/dp/1930858051\" title=\"\">Sydney Singer and Soma Grismaijer published their book Dressed to Kill,</a> which claimed there was a link. The idea was revived last year when a practitioner of alternative medicine <a href=\"http://goop.com/could-there-possibly-be-a-link-between-underwire-bras-and-breast-cancer/\" title=\"\">wrote an essay on&#xa0;Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s website</a>, Goop. What these people have in common is that none of them is a cancer researcher or medical doctor.</p> <p>Singer and Grismaijer\u2019s \u201cstudy\u201d was not reviewed by medical experts and published in a respected journal, as is&#xa0;the norm for bona fide scientific discoveries. According to a version of&#xa0;their story now doing the rounds on&#xa0;Twitter, they interviewed more than 4,000<strong> </strong>American women and discovered that women who don\u2019t wear bras have a \u201c1 in 168 chance\u201d of developing breast cancer, as opposed to a \u201c3 in 4 chance for those who wear a bra 24 hours a day\u201d.</p> <p>Their explanation is that underwired bras block circulation of lymphatic fluid, causing breasts to swell with \u201ctoxins\u201d (a word more associated with pseudoscience, in my experience, than&#xa0;genuine medical knowledge). It is unlikely, though, that that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3524994\" title=\"\">lymph fluid</a> <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-underwire-bras-cause-cancer/\" title=\"\">would be trapped by an underwire</a>, because it <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/19079.htm\" title=\"\">doesn\u2019t flow in that direction</a>, and a properly fitting bra <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/fitness/Pages/a-sports-bra-can-reduce-breast-pain-during-exercise.aspx\" title=\"\">prevents breast ligaments from overstretching</a>. Scientists have also criticised Dressed to Kill for not taking into account known risk&#xa0;factors for breast cancer, most notably obesity, which increases the likelihood a woman will wear a bra for longer periods.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25192706\" title=\"\">A comprehensive 2014 study </a>by the globally respected <a href=\"http://www.fredhutch.org/en.html\" title=\"\">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Centre</a> in Seattle found that no aspect of bra-wearing was associated with breast cancer risk, and Breast Cancer Now, Cancer Research UK, the American Cancer Society, and the US National Institutes of Health are just a few of the organisations that have <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/998348.stm\" title=\"\">stressed the lack of evidence</a> that wearing bras increases cancer risk.</p> <p>American obstetrician and gynae-cologist <a href=\"https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2014/04/13/your-bra-is-not-killing-you/\" title=\"\">Dr Jennifer Gunter</a> has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gwyneth-paltrow-bras-breast-cancer_us_56266d6de4b0bce34702523c\" title=\"\">described this myth as \u201ccruel\u201d,</a> saying that it scares women and could cause women with a breast cancer diagnosis to blame themselves for wearing a bra. If you find your bra is painful, you should not panic that you have cancer, but you should head to the high street and get measured for a new bra.</p> <h2><strong>Sweat-free armpits or healthy breasts? You have to choose</strong></h2> <p>The idea that antiperspirants cause breast cancer is usually justified either by the idea that preventing underarm stickiness blocks \u201ctoxins\u201d from being sweated out, or that the aluminium salts used to block the sweat glands are absorbed through the skin and trigger cancer. The source appears to be an <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/antiperspirant.asp\" title=\"\">email hoax</a> which spread so quickly that cancer charity helplines were overwhelmed by <a href=\"http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2007/08/31/breast-cancer-deodorants-or-the-no-links-effect/\" title=\"\">anxious callers</a> worried they had been doomed by their personal hygiene routines.</p> <p>The vast majority of harmful substances in our bodies are flushed out by the liver and kidneys (which is why we drink lots of water when we are hungover), not sweated out through our armpits. Almost all the studies purporting to show that antiperspirants cause cancer <a href=\"https://www.cancerwa.asn.au/resources/cancermyths/deodorants-breast-myth/\" title=\"\">are from a&#xa0;single laboratory</a>, with <a href=\"http://time.com/3922814/deodorant-cancer/\" title=\"\">Dr Philippa Darbre</a> often the only named author. One of the studies that, at first glance, shows <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=17629949&amp;ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum\" title=\"\">aluminium is present in breast tissue</a> is, on a second look, <a href=\"http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2007/08/31/breast-cancer-deodorants-or-the-no-links-effect/\" title=\"\">inconclusive</a> because the authors didn\u2019t compare normal (non-cancerous) tissue. Unless&#xa0;there is significantly more of something in a tumour compared with normal tissue, it isn\u2019t wise to speculate that it has a role in cancer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/94/20/1578.long\" title=\"\">A 2002 study</a> published by the Journal of the National Cancer Institute studied 1,606 women and discovered there was no link between the use of antiperspirants and cancer. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17037719\" title=\"\">Another study, in 2006</a>, compared women with and without breast cancer and found that 82% of women who were cancer-free had used antiperspirant whereas only 52% of the women with breast cancer had, which certainly doesn\u2019t support the theory that antiperspirants increase cancer risk.</p> <h2><strong>Mammograms emit cancer-causing radiation, or squeeze tumours so the cancer spreads</strong></h2> <p>Finding breast cancer early <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25928287\" title=\"\">reduces your risk of dying from it by up to 25%&#xa0;</a>\u2013 which makes the myth that mammograms cause cancer, or make it&#xa0;spread, a particularly dangerous one.&#xa0;The consensus in the medical community is that the benefits of mammograms far outweigh any risk. An annual, 20-minute mammogram involves <a href=\"http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/mammograms/benefits_risks\" title=\"\">a tiny dose of radiation</a>, less&#xa0;than a chest X-ray and nowhere near enough to increase the risk of developing a cancer. The <a href=\"https://www.cancerquest.org/cancer-biology/metastasis/overview-metastasis\" title=\"\">process of metastasis</a>, in which cells break off a tumour, spread, and settle in a different place in the body to create a secondary tumour, is biologically complex and <a href=\"http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-myths\" title=\"\">can\u2019t be caused by squeezing a tumour</a>. Mammograms are frightening because of the potential that they will find a&#xa0;cancer \u2013 but the mantra that <a href=\"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/issue/oct2013/feature1\" title=\"\">early detection saves lives is true</a> and one of&#xa0;the reasons that what used to be a&#xa0;death sentence is now survived by <a href=\"https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/information-support/have-i-got-breast-cancer/what-breast-cancer\" title=\"\">eight out of every 10</a> women diagnosed with breast cancer.</p> <p>If you are worried about cancer, you can find reliable information from<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Cancer-of-the-breast-female/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\"> NHS Choices</a>, or the websites and helpline of registered cancer charities such as <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/\" title=\"\">Cancer Research UK</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.ie/\" title=\"\">Irish Cancer Society</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macmillan.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Macmillan Cancer Support</a>.

  "<p>A lot has been written about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/startups\" title=\"\">startups</a>. It usually involves devoted employees working long hours to deliver explosive growth via ping-pong tables while the head of fun publishes another piece of thought-leadership about inspirational, values-led culture. Some startups are like that, but the amount of coverage they receive is inversely proportional to their number. There is another type of startup \u2013 rudderless, pointless and stuffed with clueless children \u2013 about which we\u2019ve heard little.</p> <p>Over the past five years I\u2019ve worked at two companies, both startups when I joined. One still is, the other has been bought by a multinational giant and just about coughs out a profit. While they could hardly be more different, both were fertile ground for all the qualities listed above \u2013 and more.</p> <p>One of the first problems experienced by fast-growing startups is the need to hire quickly. Ordinary companies have human resources departments with policies and protocols. Startups often have no need for an HR person because they don\u2019t have enough employees to warrant one. So you end up with people hiring their mates without interviews; staff knowing that their friends are going to be made redundant before their friends know; and line managers having to conduct performance reviews of the person they\u2019re going out with.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/hillary-clinton-working-presenteeism\">Presenteeism is rising fast \u2013 and only bosses can stop it | Peter Cheese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Startups that become successful are also beset by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2014/jan/16/paula-principle-part-time-holding-women-back\" title=\"\">Peter principle</a> \u2013 the idea that people are promoted to the level of their incompetence. High-growth startups don\u2019t need brilliant employees; they just need employees who don\u2019t screw up. They are like the governments of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentier_state\" title=\"\">rentier states</a> \u2013 in the short term at least, the money is guaranteed. Just don\u2019t accidentally have sex with someone you manage, or invade another country, and you\u2019ll be fine.</p> <p>The clueless people in this stratum are then rapidly promoted by the founders because they see them as the loyal veterans who were \u201cthere when we had no office, you guys, remember? Eh! Am I right! Super cool.\u201d</p> <p>I was one of them. In three years I went from an entry-level position to head of department, managing a team of more than 40 people and spending the entire time trying to look as though I knew what I was doing, with a varying degree of success. It\u2019s not that those of us in management were incapable, but any capabilities we had were a happy coincidence rather than justification for our positions.</p> <p>This particular company outgrew its startup label and the adults soon arrived, only to stumble upon the most almighty mess: hundreds of terrible decisions, many of them irreversible, made by people who think <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp\" title=\"\">Ebitda</a> is a grime artist. It turns out that adults sometimes have children so they tend not to join startups until they perceive the risks to have lessened. Unless they are the ones who start them, in which case they invariably start yacht shopping and quoting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/02/elon-musk-tesla-space-x-paypal-hyperloop-simulation\" title=\"\">Elon Musk</a>.</p> <p>That leads us to the second big problem of startups, which is the people who start them. A startup without leadership is just a group of people. You might as well be standing at a bus stop. The founder or founders have to understand the product or service, have a vision for where the company is heading, and a strategy to get it there. I\u2019m still not sure how it is possible to start a company and receive millions of dollars in funding without any of those things, but I am here to tell you that it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19e310b231cd48047dd1659a8e8f628d6a21d321\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19e310b231cd48047dd1659a8e8f628d6a21d321/238_458_3238_1943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man\u2019s hands on keyboard of laptop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hunched over a computer, the boss in question would assault the keyboard as though his intended target was the desk beneath it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PhotoAlto / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a normal company, the personality of the boss is usually diluted by the fact that the question of how to successfully run the business was answered a long time ago. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve worked with your fair share of infuriating people, but they are rarely running the whole show \u2013 and if they are, the show rarely consists of 15 people and no audience.</p> <p>It\u2019s very unlikely that the chief executive of an established company would see an advert on the way to work and immediately decide to use it as the basis for an entirely new go-to-market strategy, work on which must begin the second they arrive at the office. In a startup, all it takes for that to happen on a regular basis is for the person in charge to be a capricious narcissist with terrible <a href=\"http://performance-appraisals.org/faq/biasrecency.htm\" title=\"\">recency bias</a>: which, as luck would have it, our chief executive was.</p> <p>A startup founder\u2019s personality problems can manifest themselves in a variety of ways: pathological lying to interviewees and customers about the product; wildly contradictory decision-making; and the voicing of a million ridiculous ideas, every single one of which demands a response. (And because all the ideas are generally so hysterically unworkable, pointless or illegal \u2013 or all three \u2013 the response tends to be no, which of course means that you are the problem.

All cute breathy vocal-sighs and crashing dissonance, her music is what might have happened had Petite Meller signed to 90s Warp, or the next (il)logical step after the likes of FKA twigs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/02/why-i-love-kelela-bim-adewunmi\">Kelela</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/08/sza\">SZA</a>: a sort of industrial-strength R&amp;B; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/26/aaliyah-fashion-originator-athleisure-health-goth\">Aaliyah</a> meets Aphex Twin. </p> <p>Last year, Sarasara did <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbGkUhALBKo\">a cover of David Bowie\u2019s Heroes</a>. Why? \u201cBecause my parents used to listen to him a lot, and I grew up with his music and never quit listening to him,\u201d she explains. \u201cI started to play with recording my voice and it just came. So I published it on the internet and six months later he died. It was weird.\u201d</p> <p>Sarasara has some experience of death. Her parents \u2013 French father and Moroccan mother \u2013 died in a car crash when she was 14. She went to live with her grandmother for a year \u201cbut then she passed, too\u201d. So she went back to live in her parents\u2019 house \u201cas an emancipated child\u201d, although she hardly went wild. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to get teenage crazy as I had to become a grownup right away,\u201d she admits. \u201cMy only goal was to become self-sufficient as fast as possible.\u201d</p> <p>So she enrolled at college, where she studied English and Spanish, and then European business management and law \u2013 she has a master\u2019s degree, and is studying for a further degree in philosophy and the history of thought at night school. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good way for me to seek my answers, to realise what it means to be alive, and how to enjoy day-to-day life,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Amorfati (Latin for \u201clove of fate\u201d or \u201clove of one\u2019s fate\u201d) was another way for her to work out her feelings regarding all the tragedies she endured growing up. It starts with Juju, full of noise and drone, with eerie shrieks and cackles and guitars that sound like synths (or vice versa). As barnstorming album openers go, it\u2019s not exactly <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjyVW2izEw0\">Let\u2019s Go Crazy</a>. Sarasara\u2019s voice is freakishly high \u2013 like a gentle perfumed sigh that can pierce your eardrums \u2013 but she insists it\u2019s natural, \u201cwith a little bit of reverb, and that\u2019s it\u201d. </p> <p>She adds: \u201cI have a really high voice\u201d, then demonstrates by singing up the scale. \u201cSee?\u201d she says, proudly. \u201cI used to practise classical singing when I was younger. I\u2019m probably a soprano.\u201d Next track, Sun, is mooted to be a single, which is somewhat wishful thinking. \u201cGive me a taste, just enough to close my eyes,\u201d she sings unnervingly, over what sounds like a lullaby as envisaged by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knUDV_ppSyE\">Einst\u00fcrzende Neubaten</a>. Before you know it she\u2019s rhyming \u201curgency\u201d with \u201cemergency\u201d and intoning repeatedly: \u201cMy lover wants me dead.\u201d What\u2019s that all about? \u201cAfter my parents died, I just started to hook up with the wrong people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was with a guy who was into drugs and stuff and I started to maybe put my nose in that, too \u2026 It was a bad thing for me, so I quit. He didn\u2019t realise what he was doing, but it was very dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Succubus sounds like the sort of thing the creatures from Avatar might put on for their morning calisthenics. Wonderland is swirling, gaseous, like watching smoke dance. Sapphire is esoteric and experimental but still somehow engaging: there is a lightness here, a diaphanous quality, that one associates with pop. Purpleblue could be from an alternative universe where all the contestants on X Factor or the Voice choose songs from Vulnicura or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYxKWvbQ-Pc&amp;list=PL48A5B03D5459E5C1\">Homogenic</a>. Love is glitchy and heavily textural, like techno played by toy elves, with a suitably sinister edge. Somehow primal yet sophisticated, captivating and mysterious, enchanting and ambitious, Amorfati sounds as though it was a pleasure to make; a pleasure with a lot of pain involved. Was Sarasara exorcising her demons? \u201cIt is an exorcism, yes,\u201d she agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s me saying, \u2018I accept everything that happened to me, it\u2019s OK, and now I\u2019m here and I should be grateful for everything.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What did Herbert \u2013 who produced the album at his studio in Whitstable, Kent \u2013 make of her? \u201cI think doing this was a little bit different for him,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had a lot of fun.\u201d</p> <p>How did he describe her far-out pop? \u201cFKA twigs on Venus\u201d or anything like that?</p> <p>She laughs. </p> <p>\u201cWe talked about how he\u2019d never heard anything like me,\u201d she says, acknowledging the implicit extraordinariness of the statement, \u201ceven though he\u2019s worked with Bj\u00f6rk!\u201d </p> <p><strong>The buzz: </strong><a href=\"http://www.veryintrospective.com/home/s-a-r-a-s-a-r-a-euphoria/2016\">\u201cHer voice and swirling rhythms completely envelop you.\u201d</a> </p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> She makes Bj\u00f6rk sound ordinary. </p> <p><strong>Most likely to: </strong>Be geeky. </p> <p><strong>Least likely to: </strong>Smoke weed every day. </p> <p><strong>What to buy: </strong>Debut album Amorfati is released on 14 October by One Little Indian. </p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Bj\u00f6rk, FKA twigs, Vanessa Paradis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/01/new-band-of-the-week-noah-no-52\">Noah</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://sarasaramusic.com/\">Links: sarasaramusic.com</a></p> <p><strong>Ones to watch: </strong>\u00c4ngie, Baby in Vain, Moses Sumney, Bad Sounds, Pumarosa.</p>",

  "<p>We see aerial footage, captured late at night, of a road in a remote location lined with trees and shrubbery. On ground level a hand reaches for a spade in long grass. Synthesisers and low-pitched rumbles provide creepy sound effects. The colour palette is grim and washed out: lots of greys and a ghostly veneer.<br></p> <p>The scene plays like something out of a horror movie or True Detective. Then the voice of a steely narrator kicks in: \u201cIt was a crime that shocked the nation. A young woman brutally raped and murdered by a violent criminal who should never have been on the streets.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/jill-meagher-could-have-been-prevented-says-coroner\">Jill Meagher murder could have been prevented, says coroner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The voice belongs to John Silvester, a long-time crime reporter for the Age. This program, Conviction, airs on Tuesday night: an hourlong ABC documentary examining the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/jill-meagher-could-have-been-prevented-says-coroner\">2012 murder of the Melbourne journalist Jill Meagher</a> and the process to convict <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/13/jill-meagher-murderer-adrian-bayleys-jail-term-cut-by-three-years-on-appeal\">her killer, Adrian Bayley</a>.</p> <p>That opening re-enactment is, if not sensational, certainly borderline. It\u2019s the kind of intro Silvester himself tends to be wary of.</p> <p>\u201cAs a rule I don\u2019t like re-enactments. I think more often than not they can look cheap and nasty,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, as you saw, the actual crime was not re-enacted. I also don\u2019t pretend to be a television reporter. I don\u2019t write scripts, I tend to just talk.\u201d</p> <p>On the beat since 1979, Silvester \u2013 the son of a former Victoria police assistant commissioner \u2013 has won three Walkley awards and published more than 30 books. Some of them formed the foundation of the long-running Underbelly TV series. Directed, produced, shot and edited by Terry Carlyon, Conviction focuses largely on the investigators who \u2013 after an emotional, high-profile case \u2013 imprisoned a person many believe would have become a serial killer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d6e8d4a70445d588ff9d0c55dafd189cd72d3e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d6e8d4a70445d588ff9d0c55dafd189cd72d3e3/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two investigators on the Jill Meagher case, Paul Rowe and David Butler, on Sydney Road in Melbourne, where the ABC radio producer was last seen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two investigators on the Jill Meagher case, Paul Rowe and David Butler, on Sydney Road in Melbourne, where the ABC radio producer was last seen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Silvester and Carlyon previously collaborated on an ABC program <a href=\"http://iview.abc.net.au/programs/trigger-point/DO1132V001S00\">documenting police shootings</a>, which, Silvester believes, paved the way for police cooperation in Conviction: \u201cI think senior police saw that [Trigger Point] as pretty fair and balanced so there was probably some brownie points there,\u201d he says. But, during those early discussions, their involvement was anything but guaranteed. </p> <p>\u201cThere was certainly debate at the highest level about whether [the police] would cooperate with us. Because, one, some of their members were truly traumatised by this death and the investigation,\u201d Silvester says. \u201cAnd, two, they were concerned about letting out secrets of the interview room. So there was a debate. But, when we sat down with them, these stern men in dark suits, it became abundantly clear they wanted to tell their story.\u201d</p> <p>Silvester believes the Meagher case struck such a nerve with the general public because \u201cwe are judgmental\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/13/jill-meagher-murderer-adrian-bayleys-jail-term-cut-by-three-years-on-appeal\">Jill Meagher murderer Adrian Bayley's jail term cut by three years on appeal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe was young and pretty and working in a good job with a nice husband. We tend to unconsciously value such people\u2019s loss as greater than others. But it was also the fact that Jill was doing something all of us do: she was walking home from the pub. And that\u2019s not the sort of Melbourne that we know.\u201d</p> <p>The journo-cum-narrator (also associate producer) describes the case as one that exposed fundamental flaws in the justice system. Silvester says Bayley should have been in jail for a previous offence but successfully appealed: not on the conviction but the length of the sentence. <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/victoria-brings-in-stricter-parole-laws-after-jill-meagher-murder/story-e6frgczx-1226669510864\">The parole system has subsequently tightened</a>, making Bayley one of the most hated criminals within it.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not because of the romantic notion that oh, you killed a lovely woman so we hate you. It\u2019s much more base than that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe parole system was totally reviewed and it\u2019s now just harder to get paroled. There\u2019s a lot of crooks in jail who blame Bayley for that. The fact was, the parole board was chronically underfunded. They still used hard copy. You\u2019d go in there and there\u2019d be manilla folders. Files and files and files.\u201d</p> <p>At one point in Conviction we watch news footage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/22/jill-meagher-husband-two-years\">Jill\u2019s husband, Tom Meagher</a>, fronting the media to warn the public against sharing information about the accused online. Many outraged users on social media had established that the killer had a substantial criminal record.</p> <p>But, when a person appears in court, their record is suppressed in order for the jury to deal with facts of the case rather than the history of the accused. Sharing information about Bayley could have benefited his legal team if they were to argue the course of justice had been perverted. And, while inspiring in its sentiment, a protest of 30,000 people arranged on social media, Silvester says, \u201cwould have been much more problematic if Bayley had decided to plead not guilty\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca477ce2607d4e78335a59d2a6c55bf0e705ab9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca477ce2607d4e78335a59d2a6c55bf0e705ab9d/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Journalist John Silvester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018But when we sat down with them, these stern men in dark suits, it became abundantly clear they wanted to tell their story\u2019: John Silvester (centre) interviews David Butler for Conviction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The veteran journalist is no stranger to suppressing information for the greater good; he says crime reporters deal with it all the time. To illustrate the point, Silvester uses the following hypothetical situation involving a murder investigation. The only real lead the police have is that the killer may have been driving an orange Commodore. Do you then report about the Commodore, understanding it increases the likelihood of the vehicle being destroyed?</p> <p>\u201cNo. In that case you\u2019d sit back and let it run out,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty cowardly to say \u2018if I don\u2019t write it somebody else will\u2019, because ultimately a lot of the stories you write blur into insignificance. Do you want to remember at the end, oh yeah, that murder was not solved because the orange Commodore was burnt?\u201d</p> <p>Somebody who has reported on crime for as long as Silvester, and with such a high profile, inevitably becomes known on both sides of the law. Silvester acknowledges there are people stewing on their grudges in prison \u201cwho probably have too much time on their hands\u201d but says he\u2019s \u201cfairly relaxed about it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, put this into perspective. If I was running around being timid when I\u2019m reporting on it, where would that place us [in comparison to] the investigators from the Purana taskforce? Or from the homicide squad who deal with these people routinely? </p> <p>\u201cYou might be shitty the police didn\u2019t turn up on time when your house got burgled. You might be shitty police pulled you over and you got a speeding ticket. But I reckon any balanced person sitting and watching Conviction would, at the end of it, turn around and say \u2018I\u2019m so happy they are out there doing this work for us\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Conviction airs on the ABC on Tuesday 27 September at 8.30pm</em></p>",
  "<h2>Tom Lehrer \u2013 The Elements<br></h2> <p>If you only memorise one of these songs, make it Tom Lehrer\u2019s famous list of all the elements in the periodic table sung to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s Modern Major-General. Besides being a useful way to get to know the list, being able to sing The Elements gives you something to show off when in the company of nerds.

For one, the whole point of a periodic table is to see the elements ordered by atomic number, and this order vanishes in the song. For another, Lehrer wrote the song in 1959, since when a lot of element-discovering has gone on (if you want to be pedantic, and you should, it\u2019s been mostly element-creating). Lehrer prepared an excuse by singing at the end: \u201cThese are the only ones of which the news has come to Harvard/And there may be many others but they haven\u2019t been discar-vard\u201d.

With a fundamental (base) frequency of 60hz, this would therefore trigger sine partials of 60hz, 120hz and 300hz.\u201d </p> <p>I don\u2019t know enough about harmonics to explain the explanation, but I hope \u2013 like me \u2013 that you get about half of the idea.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/7306407\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/7306407\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Prime Composition \u2013 Daniel Jones</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Decreeing that the music should cycle \u201cthrough a Triassic sequence every 64 numbers\u201d was Jones\u2019s one \u201ccompositional decision\u201d he says. He also got reality to help direct the video by representing each prime factor as a circle in scale with its size. Otherwise Prime Composition just does what numbers do, and sounds strangely good.</p> <h2>The Mosquito</h2> <p>Almost everyone loses at least some of their hearing as they get older \u2013 a process called <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Hearing-impairment/Pages/Causes.aspx\">presbycusis</a> \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t happen suddenly. Even in their twenties, people\u2019s sensitivity to extremely high-pitched sounds generally begins to fade. The phenomenon is so reliable that almost no one in their thirties or above can hear the kinds of piercing whines that would have been insufferable in their teens. Such sounds rarely occur in daily life, however, so no one notices.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UilX9h5hoTY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UilX9h5hoTY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Mosquito: can you hear it?</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is the principle behind the Mosquito, a device designed by an inventor called Richard Stapleton, who first understood the effects of presbycusis during a visit to his father\u2019s factory in London when he was 12, and he alone found the noise in the welding room impossible to bear. In 2005 Stapleton launched the Mosquito as, to put it bluntly, a teen-repellent. A small (and robustly built) speaker, it emits a flickering shriek of 17KHz that is so annoying to young people that it drives them away from the vicinity \u2013 generally around a shop. Despite some concerns that the Mosquito may be discriminatory, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jun/20/teenager-repellent-mosquito-banned-europe\">perhaps even illegal</a> under human rights law, it appears not to cause any harm and <a href=\"http://www.compoundsecurity.co.uk/security-equipment-mosquito-mk4-anti-loitering-device\">remains on sale today</a>.

In February, this became possible for the first time when it was definitely announced that the <a href=\"http://www.space.com/31916-what-gravitational-waves-sound-like-video.html\">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory</a> (LIGO) project had, of all things, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\">observed gravitational waves</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqhUANNFXw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TWqhUANNFXw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Heavy sounds\u2026 The LIGO gravitational wave chirp </figcaption> </figure>   <p>In effect the experiment was carried out with two ultrasensitive microphones, one in Louisiana and one in Washington state. Rather than listening for ripples in the air \u2013 like normal microphones \u2013 they picked up the ones in spacetime caused by the collision of two black holes 1.3bn years ago. By converting the signal into a conventional sound wave, the researchers were able to make it audible to human ears. In future it seems likely that more of the universe will be studied this way, and other \u201csounds\u201d of vast and ancient celestial events will be recorded. The chirp will always be the first, however. </p> <h2>Pluto, the Renewer</h2> <p>With its semi-astrological response to our solar system, not to mention its astronomically inaccurate running order, Gustav Holst\u2019s Planets suite was never very scientific to start with. Nor when it was written, between 1914 and 1916, was there any knowledge of Pluto, and Holst did not rectify the matter even after the \u201cninth planet\u201d was discovered in 1930, four years before his death.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T5BM_BE8iQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_T5BM_BE8iQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Pluto, the Renewer \u2013 Colin Matthews</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2000, however, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/arts/music/08plut.html\">the Halle Orchestra commissioned Colin Matthews</a> to compose a further movement, which he called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2015/jul/15/sounds-pluto-new-horizons-colin-matthews-holst\">Pluto, the Renewer</a>. With impeccable timing, it was commercially released in 2006, just weeks after the International Astronomical Union announced that Pluto was not a planet after all. <a href=\"http://www.fabermusic.com/repertoire/pluto-the-renewer-3427\">Matthews always knew its status was disputed</a>, and in fact his fanciful and dramatic six minutes well suit what we now know of Pluto\u2019s startlingly active surface \u2013 as does Leonard Bernstein\u2019s improvised \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7xlK5d7Kig\">Pluto the Unpredictable</a>\u201d from 1972. The fact that Pluto is now neither a proper planet nor properly a part of the Planet suite seems an apt reminder that science is seldom as neat and tidy as we\u2019d like.</p> <h2>Sonifications</h2> <p>We are used to graphs that help us understand what data is saying, but some patterns make more sense as sounds \u2013 or even music, if that\u2019s what you hear. Take earthquakes in Oklahoma, which have become much more frequent recently, some say as a result of fracking. It is one thing to know this, another to look at the numbers in a chart, and still a third thing to listen to a decade of data with each tremor recreated as a \u201cplink\u201d that grows louder and deeper in proportion to its power. This track, prepared by Michael Corey and Jim Briggs, creates a feeling of gathering catastrophe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/thisisreveal/the-oklahoma-shakes\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F209728441&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Or there\u2019s proteins, which as you\u2019ll remember do a lot of the clever stuff in living things, and which are essentially long strings of differently combined amino acids.

Kate Bush \u2013 Pi</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kate-bush\">Kate Bush</a> addresses the subject of her song Pi more literally, by actually singing the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter deep into the lower decimal places with feeling and intensity. It\u2019s a great song, which does not just gesture vaguely at irrational numbers as a cool metaphor, but lets one of them actually write the lyrics. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://usability.typepad.com/confusability/2005/11/kate_bush_sings.html\">as attentive Bush fans quickly pointed out</a>, she gets pi wrong by singing \u201c3,1\u201d at the 54th decimal place where it should have been \u201c0\u201d, and later by skipping 22 decimal places altogether. Perhaps we\u2019ll credit her with hiding these errors as a deliberate mistake to reel in true pi enthusiasts \u201cwith an obsessive nature\u201d like the one she sings about.

In contrast, neighbouring Thailand \u2013 which itself is thought to have a problem with under-reporting, <a href=\"http://bangkok.coconuts.co/2014/03/21/most-thailands-rape-victims-are-students\">recorded 32,000 rapes</a> in the same year.</p> <p>Based in a small, second floor office in a crowded Yangon neighbourhood, Legal Clinic Myanmar\u2019s group of 30 lawyers are among the few people in the country seeking to secure rape convictions in the face of official silence.</p> <p>\u201cBurmese Women are often too ashamed to report a rape case,\u201d said Hla Hla Yee, a solicitor who founded the clinic in 2011 to offer free legal advice and support to vulnerable people, particularly women. \u201cThey also often don\u2019t know anything about the law and how to get justice.\u201d</p> <p>More often than not, she added, crimes against women are made to disappear: the rape survivor is forced to marry the man who assaulted her, or one family gives money to \u201ccompensate\u201d, or pay off, the other. </p> <p>In 2014, the <a href=\"http://www.genmyanmar.org\">Gender Equality Network</a>, an umbrella organisation for more than 100 Burmese NGOs and civil society groups including Legal Clinic Myanmar, found that <a href=\"http://www.genmyanmar.org/publications/Behind%20the%20SilenceFullReportEnglish.pdf\">almost half of women surveyed</a> had experienced either non-partner rape, sexual assault, or sexual harassment. Many more had experienced marital rape, which is not against the law in Myanmar.

But Myanmar\u2019s women also need new laws.</p> <p>\u201cIn Myanmar, there is no particular law to protect women, and there is a general lack of rule and order,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Corruption is rife in the criminal justice system, she added. Even when rapists are prosecuted their sentences vary in length.

The mother of two 16-year-old boys, in 2006 she was housed in temporary accommodation by Brent council after leaving an abusive relationship (her name has been changed to preserve her anonymity). The two-bedroom flat she was placed in was managed by a housing association. It didn\u2019t own the property, instead <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_(law)\" title=\"\">leasing it from the&#xa0;freeholder</a>.</p> <p>In 2011, a social worker brokered an informal shared custody arrangement with her ex-husband, meaning her sons would now divide their time between their parents\u2019 respective homes. Critically, the boys\u2019 child benefit and housing benefit payments were transferred to Gunita\u2019s ex-husband. This meant that, even though Gunita was still the main emotional carer, in the eyes of the housing authorities she had essentially become a single person.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4926b0a27117a9d750df135ab8dbee7169d9b4bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4926b0a27117a9d750df135ab8dbee7169d9b4bf/0_218_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedian Russell Brand at a 2014 protest to save social housing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comedian Russell Brand at a 2014 protest to save social housing at the New Era Estate in east London, putting an eviction notice on the office of Edward Benyon who, after buying the estate, was accused of forcing up the rents and making tenants homeless.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jules Annan/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gunita had always paid her rent, but in August 2015 she received an eviction notice from the housing association. The freeholder wanted to move the social tenants on so they could let the flat on the private market. Gunita made a homelessness application to Brent, and received a phone call from a caseworker asking her to view a one-bedroom property. She tried to explain that, with two 16-year-olds living with her half the time, one bedroom would be too small. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t listen,\u201d she says. \u201cHe just said: \u2018You have to take this property. I know you are single because you are separated. Your boys are not living with you.\u2019 I tried to explain that we are sharing custody, but he just said the same thing again and again.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later, Gunita received a letter stating that Brent would be discharging its duty towards her. Once the eviction had gone ahead, she would therefore need to find a place in the private sector. For someone receiving jobseeker\u2019s allowance, there was little prospect of raising enough money for a deposit, even if she could find a private landlord who would accept a <a href=\"https://hackneyrenters.org/2016/02/22/just-one-studio-flat-in-all-of-hackney-and-seven-other-reasons-why-landlords-and-estate-agents-should-say-yesdss/\" title=\"\">tenant in receipt of housing benefit</a>. Now realising that she was facing street homelessness, Gunita\u2019s mental health deteriorated dramatically.</p> <p>This situation could have been avoided had the council offered Gunita a second chance. She accepts that she should have looked at the property, but is adamant that the ramifications of turning down an offer were never fully explained.

  "<p>On the cover of <a href=\"http://www.garyyounge.com/\" title=\"\">Gary Younge</a>\u2019s new book, <em>Another Day in the Death of America</em>, there\u2019s a full frontal of a smiling white American family. It\u2019s a portrait of a 1950s American dream that stands in brilliant contrast to the reality of the country that is revealed beyond this cover. Take the story of 16-year-old African American Samuel Brightmon, who lived in Dallas. Having spent the evening at home with his family and a friend playing Uno (and cheating, \u201cthough not as egregiously as usual\u201d), he offered to walk his friend part of the way home. When they passed a car with its headlights off but brake lights on they remarked on it but&#xa0;kept going. Not for long, however: a shot rang out, killing Samuel. \u201cOne minute we\u2019re playing Uno,\u201d his friend reflected, \u201c10, 15 minutes later \u2013 boom.\u201d Samuel\u2019s wake was held on 29 November, the day he would have turned 17. No one has been charged with his murder: the working assumption being that this was just another case of mistaken identity.</p> <p>Samuel is one of the 10 people known to have been killed by guns on 23 November 2013. That\u2019s the day <em>Guardian</em> journalist Gary Younge randomly selected for this book, after which he spent 18 months unearthing the stories that lay behind these young lives and their premature deaths. It is a gripping account that leads the reader through places as disparate as the vast corn and soya fields of Michigan and the killing fields of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/12/barack-obama-gun-violence-chicago\" title=\"\">Chicago</a>, where gunfire is now so common that dogs are said to have stopped barking at it. It\u2019s a journey through a deeply troubled America that will make its reader want to join the author in howling at the moon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The stories that Younge has uncovered are often sensational but he tells them without hyperbole</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ten young lives: 10 deaths from guns. But <em>Another Day in the Death of America</em> is not a book about gun control: it\u2019s a book about what has happened in a country where there is no gun control. And although all the victims were at the beginning of their lives, this is not a book about innocents gunned down. It is, instead, a gripping account of the conditions that turn so many of America\u2019s powerless into victims. There are stories to make the reader weep. Like those of nine-year-old Jaiden Dixon and 11-year-old Tyler Dunn, who had two things in common: the first that they both loved US reality TV show <em>Duck Dynasty</em>; the second that they were both shot by people they knew \u2013 in Jaiden\u2019s case, by his mother\u2019s ex-boyfriend; in Tyler\u2019s case, mistakenly, by his best friend. And there are other stories of those apparently less innocent \u2013 those who themselves may have killed, before in turn becoming victims.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to mourn lives cut down prematurely but what makes this book stand out is the strength of its analysis. Younge counters our understandable reaction to feel more deeply for \u201cinnocents\u201d or \u201cangels\u201d by examining the structural roots of a crisis that has resulted in such everyday killings. He nails a succession of myths (or as he calls it, \u201cfrisks the straw men\u201d): that, for example, America is a meritocracy, or that the current crisis resides in the failure of African American families (of the 10 deaths, seven were black, two Hispanic and one white) to discipline their children, or that talking about crime (which he forensically examines) is a taboo subject among African Americans.</p> <p>In his 2015 book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/08/between-the-world-and-me-sukhdev-sandhu-review\" title=\"\"><em>Between the World and Me</em></a>, Ta-Nehisi Coates writes to his son about the danger to black bodies in America, and about the sting of his own father\u2019s leather belt, which was the result of his fear of what might befall his son in the face of such dangers. This is a world that Younge also explores as he writes of the \u201ccocoon world\u201d in which black parents&#xa0;try to wrap their children in the hope of keeping them safe. And yet in the impoverished communities where most of these victims exist, Younge shows how this effort is often fruitless.</p> <p>One of the many strengths of his book is the sensitivity with which he approaches the families, thus allowing them to share their lived experiences with the reader. And what they share is heart-rending. Take, for example, Regina, mother of 18-year-old <a href=\"http://homicides.suntimes.com/2013/11/24/tyshon-anderson-shot-dead-in-south-chicago/\" title=\"\">Tyshon Anderson</a>, killed in a gang-related incident. \u201cI hate the fact that he\u2019s gone,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I look at it like now I don\u2019t have to worry about him being out there killing nobody else or nobody else trying to kill him. It was sad to see him laying there. But I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s over, because now every day I have to live is a day when they\u2019re not going to kill him.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/09/richmond-california-ons-gun-crime\">A radical approach to gun crime: paying people not to kill each other | Jason Motlagh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here\u2019s another of the parents, Samuel Brightmon\u2019s father, Willie, talking about how little the rest of America cares about the death of children like his son. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a black child shot, it\u2019s a flash,\u201d he says. \u201cLike a flash of lightning. You see it and you\u2019ll be like, was that lightning? That\u2019s how it is when a black child gets murdered or gets killed. No big news\u2026 in the end result you are still living in a white world. And we\u2019re still thought of as less than. And basically, they\u2019re saying we don\u2019t matter. But if it was their child, they want the world to come to a halt.\u201d</p> <p>The stories that Younge has uncovered are often sensational but he tells them without hyperbole and accompanies them with an analysis that lays bare the reality of being black and poor in America: in the everyday existence, for example, of the need for local organisations such as <a href=\"http://momocares.org/\" title=\"\">Mothers of Murdered Offspring</a>, or in the matter-of-fact presentation of the more than 20% of children in Chicago public schools who, in 2012, are said to have witnessed a shooting, or in the disclosure that African Americans are six times more likely to be incarcerated, twice as likely to be unemployed, and almost three times more likely to live in poverty than whites.</p> <p>Despite the composure of his writing, there is passion in Younge\u2019s condemnation of a system that renders the poor and the dark in America invisible. In illuminating the stories of some of these people and of their communities, Younge has provided us&#xa0;with a beautifully told and empathic&#xa0;account that wrenches at the&#xa0;heart even as it continues to engage the brain.</p> <p><em>Gillian Slovo\u2019s latest novel, </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ten-days-429740.html\" title=\"\"><em>Ten Days</em></a><em>, is published by Canongate.

Welcome to the race for the international community\u2019s top diplomatic job \u2013 United Nations secretary general.</p> <p>The eventual winner of the contest will ascend to become a secular saint, an ambassador of peace and voice of the poor and downtrodden. But the road to such a lofty position is paved with landmines and booby traps. </p> <p>On Monday, the UN security council will hold the fifth of a series of straw polls aimed at picking a winner from the remaining nine contenders in the race, in which the 15 council members will cast secret ballots. </p> <p>The clear leader to date has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/antonio-guterres-united-nations-secretary-general\">Ant\u00f3nio Guterres</a>, the former Portuguese prime minister and UN high commissioner for refugees.

Each contender had to present a personal manifesto before the 193 countries in the general assembly, and Guterres won points for his humour, charisma and mastery of his brief. But his route to the secretary generalship could still be blocked by a veto from one of the five permanent council members, most plausibly Russia. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ab686cfd75d8d0e862e273aefc8dd6e4bd7aff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ab686cfd75d8d0e862e273aefc8dd6e4bd7aff4/0_1303_2757_1654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Guterres\u2019 route to the job could still be blocked by a veto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonio Guterres\u2019 route to the job could still be blocked by a veto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moscow argues it is the turn of an eastern European to provide the UN leadership, and may balk at the former leader of a western European Nato member state taking the helm.

But the account turned out to be a fake. </p> <p>In second place is Slovakia\u2019s foreign minister, Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, who enjoyed a surprise surge from second last after his country\u2019s pro-Russia prime minister, Robert Fico, visited Moscow <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://euobserver.com/foreign/134722\">four days before</a> the third poll and made a point of highlighting his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/357330-slovakia-eu-russia-sanctions/\">criticisms of EU sanctions</a> on Russia over Crimea. For that reason, Laj\u010d\u00e1k may face a veto from one or more of the western members of the permanent five.</p> <p>Third-placed Vuk Jeremi\u0107, the former Serbian foreign minister, will almost certainly be vetoed by the US, diplomats say. Washington has not forgiven Jeremi\u0107 for his opposition to Kosovan independence, amid its perception that he used his time as president of the general assembly as a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/25/unga-presidents-serbian-nationalism-rankles-western-powers/\">platform for nationalist rhetoric</a>.</p> <p>The threat of vetoes, however, will only become decisive in the next round, when the permanent five will cast coloured ballots.

A fortnight ago, government officials briefed journalists in Sofia that Borisov was about to swing his support behind Georgieva. However, soon afterwards he changed his mind and said he <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/bulgaria-mulls-kristalina-georgieva-for-un-post-ban-ki-moon-secretary-general/\">would wait to see</a> how Bokova did in the fifth ballot on Monday before making up his mind. </p> <p>Since then, Russian officials have been canvassing votes for Bokova as a way of keeping Georgieva out of the race. </p> <p>\u201cIf Russia can get her to 10 \u2018encourages\u2019 it would be hard for Borisov to defenestrate her. If she stays at seven or eight, she is not safe,\u201d said Richard Gowan, an expert on the UN at the European Council for Foreign Relations. </p> <p>Even if Georgieva did make a late entrance into the race, she could still face a veto from Russia. She is after all a member of a European commission, currently enforcing sanctions on Moscow. </p> <p>The permanent five\u2019s potential vetoes in the secretary general contest are bargaining chips on a table on which rivalry in Syria, Ukraine and other conflicts is being brokered. The poisonous atmosphere in the council could make for a protracted struggle to which the most qualified candidates fall victim, opening the way for a more obscure contender. </p> <p>Alternatively, Gowan argues, the permanent five might momentarily bury their differences to protect their shared privilege, as failure to do so would open the way for the wider UN membership in the general assembly to play a greater role in resolving security council deadlock.</p> <p>\u201cFor all the geopolitical difference, the logic of P5 control means they could still do a deal.

Ambitious politicians, given an open goal, tend to take a shot at it.</p> <p>When the wound-licking is done, the more important matter will be what kind of relationship Britain should have with the EU after the divorce. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s powerful but testy finance minister, has just got shirty with the foreign secretary\u2019s blithe suggestion that there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/france-and-germany-brush-off-johnsons-eu-baloney-jibe\" title=\"\">not necessarily a trade-off between the single market and freedom of movement</a> inside the EU. That will not necessarily please Angela Merkel, who has phrased her response to Brexit with deliberate calm. \u201cShe knows punishment beatings won\u2019t help get this sorted,\u201d a confidant in the Kanzleramt tells me. Merkel does not remotely like Brexit and believes it a mistake for Britain and Germany. But as a child of the old East Germany, she is keenly aware that elites sounding bitter or resentful about a popular movement is counterproductive.</p> <p>Absolutists on both sides are reluctant to move on. Yet they must, for the good of Britain and also the wider EU, which is more afflicted by post-referendum turbulence than it can readily admit. Practical inquiry will soon turn to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\" title=\"\">whether Brexit should be of the soft or hard variety</a>. The \u201csofty tendency\u201d wants to retain single market access, or at least as much of it as can be salvaged via trade deals. And while Sch\u00e4uble is right that the Lisbon treaty links freedoms of movement to single market access, that does not account for the EU\u2019s tendency to state that things are inviolable \u2013 and then, under pressure, negotiate on them.</p> <p>A generous offer on freedom of movement for those with guarantees of work and study places, for instance, would get a better reception in Europe than the hardline anti-immigration suggestion that Fortress Britain needs very few incomers to prosper. Hard Brexit advocates are already staking out their ground: \u201cSome vainly advocate retaining features of EU membership after leaving but this is not practical,\u201d raps the longstanding Tory Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin.</p> <p>But the ghosts of pre-EU diplomacy stalk post-referendum Europe. Better to&#xa0;look to the early 19th century and Count Metternich, wheeler-dealing to save the fortunes of Austria by dogged pursuit of d\u00e9tente with France and alignments with Prussia/Russia (\u201cunthinkables\u201d and \u201cimpracticals\u201d in their day too), rather than the trumpet blasts of Boris or Jean-Claude Juncker. \u201cEvents which cannot be prevented must be directed,\u201d the great Austrian diplomatic fixer once remarked \u2013 a lesson for those who have to deliver on the Brexit promise.</p> <p>Many convinced, outraged, piqued or spuriously confident voices will say that hard Brexit is the decisive way to go. Nigel Farage is already priming his comeback in defence of this proposition. Perversely, it appeals to avowed sceptics in Britain and those in the institutional EU who still believe that putting Britain out in the cold is the best way to cauterise revolt elsewhere. Here is a recipe for deepening animosity. Geography is master of all our fates and post-Brexit, we still have to share a continent.</p> <p>A gentler methodology requires patience about the pace of negotiations from the British, government and an acceptance in the EU that since Britain is the first big \u201cex-member state\u201d, its final status will, by definition, be something that has not existed before. The hardest part might not be finding a fudge on freedom of movement, via work permits and a broad deal on student visas \u2013 but the right recipe for maintaining trade and cultural links. If soft Brexit\u2019s contours are still vague, it starts with a state of mind, which understands that Brexit needs to be delivered and does not only harp in bad faith on the defeat of remainers, but which also accepts the great jeopardy in leaving the EU, and thus that the process is best undertaken as circumspectly as possible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It will cause ructions inside the Conservatives, but the least worst option is better than the alternatives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A \u201cUsain Bolt\u201d model, in which a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\" title=\"\">race to trigger article 50</a> becomes the starting gun for the fastest possible Brexit, will cut off compromises, deepen misunderstandings and leave a sulky UK offshore from a bruised and crosser EU, with practical details of how we will associate with member states dangerously unclear.</p> <p>The softy tendency must start to build a coalition of support and make its case.

It will cause ructions inside the Conservatives and a wider argument about what Brexit is to mean, but the least worst option is better than the alternatives. Metternich had a natty coinage for that too: \u201cThe obvious is always the least understood.\u201d Not for the first time, he was on to something.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Anne McElvoy is senior editor at the Economist</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88e7f80e8aeb785320ae23980a9a38a426e5f3ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88e7f80e8aeb785320ae23980a9a38a426e5f3ae/0_230_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Many like Nigel Farage will say that hard Brexit is the decisive way to go.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

The UK had <a href=\"http://www.industry.gov.au/resource/Documents/radioactive_waste/RoyalCommissioninToBritishNucleartestsinAustraliaVol%201.pdf\">carried out atomic tests</a> in 1952 and 1956 at the Montebello Islands off Western Australia and, in 1953, at Emu Field, north of Maralinga.</p> <p>The British had requested and were granted a huge chunk of South Australia to create a \u201cpermanent\u201d atomic weapons test site, after finding the conditions at Montebello and Emu Field too remote and unworkable. Australia\u2019s then prime minister, Robert Menzies, was all too happy to oblige. Back in September 1950 in a phone call with his British counterpart, Clement Attlee, he had said yes to nuclear testing without even referring the issue to his cabinet.</p> <p>Menzies was not entirely blinded by his well-known anglophilia; he also saw advantages for Australia in granting Britain\u2019s request. He was seeking assurances of security in a post-Hiroshima, nuclear-armed world and he believed that working with the UK would provide guarantees of at least British protection, and probably US protection as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/31/why-cabinet-sought-only-partial-clean-up-of-british-nuclear-test-site\">Why cabinet sought only a partial clean-up of British nuclear test site</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was also exploring ways to power civilian Australia with atomic energy and \u2013 whisper it \u2013 even to buy an <a href=\"https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/walsh51.pdf\">atomic bomb with an Australian flag on it</a> (for more background, see <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/historical-journal/article/rethinking-the-joint-project-australias-bid-for-nuclear-weapons-19451960/DCE2FC212FCE7F81F5A6951B21357916\">here</a>). While Australia had not been involved in developing either atomic weaponry or nuclear energy, it wanted in now. Menzies\u2019 ambitions were such that he authorised offering more to the British than they requested.</p> <p>While Australia was preparing to sign the Maralinga agreement, the supply minister, Howard Beale, wrote in a top-secret 1954 cabinet document:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although [the] UK had intimated that she was prepared to meet the full costs, Australia proposed that the principles of apportioning the expenses of the trial should be agreed whereby the cost of Australian personnel engaged on the preparation of the site, and of materials and equipment which could be recovered after the tests, should fall to Australia\u2019s account.</p> </blockquote> <p>Beale said he did not want Australia to be a mere \u201chewer of wood and drawer of water\u201d for the British, but a respected partner of high (though maybe not equal) standing with access to the knowledge generated from the atomic tests.</p> <p>That hope was forlorn and unrealised. Australia duly hewed the wood and drew the water at Maralinga, and stood by while Britain\u2019s nuclear and military elite trashedtracts of its landscape and then, in the mid-1960s, promptly left. Britain carried out a total of 12 major weapons tests in Australia: three at Montebello, two at Emu Field and seven at Maralinga. The British also conducted hundreds of so-called \u201cminor trials\u201d, including the highly damaging Vixen B radiological experiments, which scattered long-lived plutonium over a large area at Maralinga.</p> <p>The British carried out two cleanup operations \u2013 Operation Hercules in 1964 and Operation Brumby in 1967 \u2013 both of which made the contamination problems worse.</p> <h2>Legacy of damage</h2> <p>The damage done to Indigenous people in the vicinity of all three test sites is immeasurable and included displacement, injury and death. Service personnel from several countries, but particularly Britain and Australia, also suffered \u2013 not least because of their continuing fight for the slightest recognition of the dangers they faced. Many of the injuries and deaths allegedly caused by the British tests have not been formally linked to the operation, a source of ongoing distress for those involved.</p> <p>The cost of the cleanup <a href=\"http://www.industry.gov.au/resource/Documents/radioactive_waste/martac_report.pdf\">exceeded $100m</a> in the late 1990s. Britain paid less than half, and only after protracted pressure and negotiations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jan/22/nuclear-testing-british-servicemen-compensation\">Bomb test 'guinea pigs' fight for redress in court</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Decades later, we still don\u2019t know the full extent of the effects suffered by service personnel and local communities. Despite years of legal wrangling, those communities\u2019 suffering has never been properly recognised or compensated.</p> <p>Why did Australia allow it to happen? The answer is that Britain asserted its nuclear colonialism just as an anglophile prime minister took power in Australia, and after the US made nuclear weapons research collaboration with other nations illegal, barring further joint weapons development with the UK.</p> <p>Menzies\u2019 political agenda emphasised national security and tapped into cold war fears. While acting in what he thought were Australia\u2019s interests (as well as allegiance to the \u201cmother country\u201d), he displayed a reckless disregard for the risks of letting loose huge quantities of radioactive material without adequate safeguards.</p> <p>Six decades later, those atomic weapons tests still cast their shadow across Australia\u2019s landscape. They stand as testament to the dangers of government decisions made without close scrutiny, and as a reminder \u2013 at a time when leaders are once again preoccupied with international security \u2013 not to let it happen again.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This piece was originally published by <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/sixty-years-on-the-maralinga-bomb-tests-remind-us-not-to-put-security-over-safety-62441\">the Conversation</a>.

I believe in accountability. My problem is when people bring that accountant-trained lens to services that you can\u2019t always measure in numbers, time spent and standardised outputs delivered.</p> <p>We\u2019re living in a world that is increasingly measured by the bottom line and economic growth at any cost. It\u2019s a world where people are reduced to human resources and where \u201cunproductive\u201d members of society are rendered invisible. And nowhere is that more so than in our prison system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/05/prison-teachers-protest-against-job-cuts-and-outsourcing-to-staff-without-degrees\">Prison teachers protest against job cuts and outsourcing to staff without degrees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which is why it comes as no surprise that the New South Wales Baird government is preparing to rid the system of more than 130 expert educators. In their place, the government wants to bring in outside \u201ctrainers\u201d who will not need to have tertiary teaching qualifications.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/05/prison-teachers-protest-against-job-cuts-and-outsourcing-to-staff-without-degrees\">Their plan is partly based on a report by KPMG</a>, according to a senior source at the NSW Teacher\u2019s Federation. It has not been made public.</p> <p>The NSW corrections minister, David Elliott, told a state parliamentary committee: \u201cYou do not need to have a bachelor\u2019s degree to teach literacy to a prisoner\u201d. What\u2019s really needed in our jails, he suggests, is a much stronger focus on teaching basic vocational skills.</p> <p>On the face of it, that makes some sense. Surely the solution to recidivism is to turn out former inmates who are ready to enter a trade or who are at least literate and numerate enough to get a job in a factory or shop.</p> <p>Except that inmates are already being taught literacy and numeracy as part of a curriculum that aims to engage them in a deeper educational experience \u2013 an experience that many of them never had as kids or teenagers. And it\u2019s that engagement that can, for some, become a turning point in developing confidence in themselves and seeing that they have a role in the world outside the prison walls.</p> <p>Unbelievably, prison is sometimes the first place that many inmates get access to quality education and health services. For many of them, their major contact with state services has involved child welfare, police and the courts.</p> <p>Those who work in prison education \u2013 and that\u2019s not an easy gig \u2013 will tell you that it can take months and even years to gain the trust of an inmate. But that when it works, the pedagogical relationship is incredibly rewarding.</p> <p>Visual arts educator Elizabeth Day has worked in prison education for 26 years and she has witnessed incredible breakthroughs in her work with prisoners. She says that art classes, which are only a small part of the curriculum, can be very powerful in giving inmates an opportunity to explore their potential and their cultural identities.</p> <p>She also says that Indigenous inmates, who are disproportionately represented in our prison population, respond particularly strongly to art and Aboriginal culture programs. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I ran into a former Indigenous student recently at an art exhibition. He had reestablished himself as an artist on the outside. He was reconciling with his family and he said how important the arts and Aboriginal culture programs in jail had been in gaining an understanding of being affected by the Stolen Generations.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not the kind of experience that prisoners are likely to get from learning how to count or weld. Yes, they need vocational skills. Yet, the deeper issue is that education is not merely about teaching people how to do things. At it\u2019s best, it\u2019s about teaching them how to know themselves and how to find their place in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/face-the-facts-competition-and-profit-dont-work-in-health-education-or-prisons\">Face the facts: competition and profit don't work in health, education or prisons | John Quiggin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As someone who was privileged enough to graduate with an elite law degree, I am always conscious of why and how our prison system remains a holding pen for people who never had that kind of educational opportunity. They are literally the ghosts of our civil dead.</p> <p>People who have had so little opportunity to be taught by people who care about their personal education \u2013 as opposed to processing them to produce more statistics about their literacy and numeracy \u2013 deserve to be taught by the best. Not by trainers, but by dedicated teachers.</p> <p>As Elizabeth Day told me when explaining her perseverance: \u201cI quote Barack Obama who said that the best teachers should be in the worst places.\u201d</p> <p>If we want to change the horrific revolving door that our prison system has become we need to value and pay the people who care about building relationships with inmates and understand them before they can teach them. And if money is the issue \u2013 think about what it costs to keep building prisons and sending the same people back.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cIf our civilisation is to survive,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/10/karl-popper-enemy-uncertainty\">Karl Popper</a> writes at the beginning of this passionate defence of freedom and reason, \u201cwe must break with the habit of deference to great men.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/open-society-and-its-enemies-4.html\"><em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em></a>, conceived in the 1930s, and completed in the 1940s, would become a key text of the 1960s, and its author a profound, sometimes thrilling, influence on a new generation of college students. Thus, a book inspired by the Nazi invasion of Austria in 1938, but actually written in the secluded tranquillity of New Zealand\u2019s South Island, became a rallying cry, on behalf of western liberal democracy, for the postwar renewal of the European tradition.</p> <p>Before the inevitable backlash, Popper, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 intellectual determined to address \u201cthe difficulties faced by our civilisation\u201d, became a touchstone for progressive opinion. His fierce critique of Plato, Hegel and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/14/karl-marx-greatness-and-illusion-review-gareth-stedman-jones\">Marx</a> was understood as an assault on totalitarian thought, and became widely fashionable, even when denounced by dissenting scholars and rivals. At the same time, <em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em> (published in two volumes: <em>The Spell of Plato</em> and <em>The High Tide of Prophecy: Hegel, Marx, and the Aftermath</em>) was the product of the philosopher\u2019s own intellectual journey.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The rhetorical force and clarity of Popper\u2019s writing is singular and impressive, and never less than intensely readable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a young man, Popper had adopted Marxism, a decision that would seriously influence many of his later ideas. For a few months in 1919 he had even considered himself a communist, becoming quite at home with the orthodoxies of class conflict, and the central tenets of Marxist economics and history. Although he quickly became disillusioned, this youthful flirtation with Marxist ideology would lead him to distance himself from those who believed in violent revolution. Eventually, during the long disillusionment of the 1920s, he came to realise that the sacrifice of human life must be a last resort, and that radical thought and conduct must be exercised with exemplary caution and prudence.</p> <p>Popper was not only dismayed by the failure of democratic parties to prevent fascism from taking over Austrian politics in the 1920s and 1930s, he suffered directly from the consequences of this historic failure. The Nazis\u2019 annexation of Austria, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/century/1930-1939/Story/0,,127158,00.html\">Anschluss of 1938</a>, forced the young philosopher into permanent exile. Henceforth, he would devote himself to a lifelong assault on totalitarian thought in general, and Marxism in particular.</p> <p>His philosophical interests also concerned science and the uncertainty of knowledge. Some of his teaching, indeed, would eventually play an important part in the intellectual development of Thomas Kuhn (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/20/100-best-nonfiction-books-all-time-thomas-s-kuhn-structure-of-scientific-revolutions-paradigm-shift\">No 21 in this series</a>). Popper questioned the idea that there were inexorable laws of human history, believing history to be influenced by the growth of knowledge, which is always unpredictable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/10/karl-popper-enemy-uncertainty\">Karl Popper, the enemy of certainty, part 1: a rejection of empiricism | Liz Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Popper had first expressed his arguments about science in <em>The Logic of Scientific Discovery</em> (1934), arguing that science proceeds through bold, competing conjectures subjected to rigorous testing. He once said that \u201cnext to music and art, science is the greatest, most beautiful and most enlightening achievement of the human spirit\u201d.</p> <p>But it was as the sponsor of the idea of \u201cthe open society\u201d, and defender of democratic systems, that he became most widely known. <em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em>, finally published in 1945, has been described as one of the most influential books of the 20th century. As well as popularising the open society, it argued that communism and fascism were philosophically linked, and demonstrated the subtle interconnections of politics and culture: \u201cThe contention that Plato\u2019s political programme is purely totalitarian, and the objections to this contention,\u201d writes Popper, \u201chave led us to examine the part played, within this programme, by such moral ideas as Justice, Wisdom, Truth and Beauty.\u201d In response, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/nov/18/bertrand-russell-philosopher-religion-ethics-life\">Bertrand Russell</a>, an important champion, declared Popper\u2019s work to be \u201ca vigorous and profound defence of democracy, timely, interesting and very well written\u201d.</p> <p>With hindsight, it\u2019s the rhetorical force and clarity of Popper\u2019s writing that is both singular and impressive, and also never less than intensely readable: \u201cWho can doubt that Plato reveals here how seriously he was impressed by the creed of the open society, and how hard he had to struggle to come to his senses and to realise where he was \u2013 namely, in the camp of its enemies.\u201d</p> <p>In his introduction to a second edition, Popper concedes the degree to which his work was influenced by the second world war: \u201cThe fact that most of the book was written during the grave years when the outcome of the war was uncertain may help to explain why some of its criticism [is] more emotional and harsher in tone than I could wish. But it was not time to mince words.\u201d</p> <p>Popper claimed he\u2019d never made any explicit reference to the war. Nonetheless, his book \u201cwas an attempt to understand those events and their background, and some of the issues which were likely to arise after the war was won\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/20/100-best-nonfiction-books-all-time-thomas-s-kuhn-structure-of-scientific-revolutions-paradigm-shift\">The 100 best nonfiction books: No 21 \u2013 The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas S Kuhn (1962)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the spirit of the cold war, and the political climate in which <em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em> was first being read, Popper did not hesitate to declare Marxism \u201ca major problem\u201d and just \u201cone of the many mistakes we have made in the perennial and dangerous struggle for building a better and freer world\u201d.

But not by insulting them | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nevertheless, we shouldn\u2019t delude ourselves: the poll reveals a substantial constituency into which Hansonism can tap.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth then considering the difference between the first and the second incarnations of Pauline Hanson.</p> <p>The 90s-era One Nation targeted \u201cAsians\u201d and Indigenous people, denouncing the bipartisan commitment to multiculturalism in the name of an older Australia and its cultural norms. That rhetoric was largely nostalgic, since the Anglo monoculture of the Hansonite imaginary had, at least in the cities, already given way to multiracial cosmopolitanism. </p> <p>Since then, of course, the integration of Australian capitalism into Asia has only intensified with, for instance, recent economic prosperity driven by a mining boom dependent upon Chinese markets.</p> <p>The widespread pandering to Hanson after her early electoral successes masked the extent to which One Nation was pushing against the prevailing economic and political winds.</p> <p>The rebooted project is rather different.</p> <p>In Hanson\u2019s recent speech, Asians barely featured. In their place, we heard an almost exclusively anti-Muslim rhetoric. That rhetoric built on 15 years of warnings by the major parties that al-Qaida (and then Islamic State) represented a near-existential threat to Australia.</p> <p>The \u201cwar on terror\u201d has fundamentally reshaped both foreign and domestic policy. In its Defence Budget Brief 2014-2015, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/iraq-deployment-to-cost-australia-about-400-million-a-year-20140915-10h35o.html\">the Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimates</a> the nation has allocated nearly $20bn on military deployments in the past two decades, overwhelmingly in Muslim nations. Since 9/11, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/reactive-anti-terror-laws-risk-further-eroding-freedoms-without-making-us-safer-50959\">Australia has enacted more than 60 separate anti-terrorism laws</a>, many of which challenge basic principles of democratic jurisprudence.</p> <p>The most recent budget allocates over $35bn to defence, national security and law enforcement. \u201cKeeping Australia and Australians safe and secure is the highest responsibility of the government,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2015-16/content/glossy/nat_sec/html/nat_sec-01.htm\">we\u2019re told</a>.</p> <p>In other words, if the original One Nation was swimming against the tide, Pauline Hanson 2.0 is surfing a wave. Since 2001, Australians have been told again and again to be very scared of Muslims. The Hansonites repackage that message in a more plebeian format, presenting Islam as an all-purpose scapegoat for social and economic anxieties.</p> <p>Presented in that light, the Essential Poll isn\u2019t that surprising.</p> <p>Yet an explanation of anti-Muslim sentiment shouldn\u2019t become a justification for it.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/progressives-can-attract-hanson-supporters-but-not-by-insulting-them\">response by my colleague Peter Lewis</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/04/pauline-hanson-takes-centre-stage-again-but-this-time-we-should-listen-not-lampoon\">others</a>, deserve to be debated. </p> <p>\u201c[H]ere\u2019s the challenge to everyone concerned or affronted by these findings,\u201d Lewis writes. \u201cHow do you tell half the population that they are wrong? The answer is you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis notes that one quarter of voters think they\u2019ll be less secure in their job in the next two years, and only a third expect to be employed by the same boss in five years time.</p> <p>That genuine uncertainty, he says, fuels populism of the left and the right. Rather than denouncing Hanson voters, we should be addressing their real concerns. He argues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a progressive political agenda that can resonate with all these disengaged and distrustful people, while at the same time taking the heat out of their fear and insecurity.</p> <p>It\u2019s about such unfashionable ideas as income distribution, workplace bargaining rights, industry development and corporate responsibility.</p> <p>That\u2019s the political challenge to responding to Hanson and her supporters: not to call them names that may make us feel superior but to listen and harness their sense of protest to more constructive ends.</p> </blockquote> <p>Certainly, we\u2019ve seen a depressing tendency in which so-called progressives respond to Hansonism and other manifestations of conservative populism by denouncing ordinary people as incorrigible bigots and suggesting measures to short circuit the democratic process so as to keep the oiks under control.</p> <p>And there\u2019s a lot to like in Lewis\u2019 call for a different kind of politics.</p> <p>Nevertheless, you can\u2019t build a \u201cprogressive political agenda\u201d without tackling bigotry.</p> <p>In Jim Crow America, for instance, the vast majority of whites identified African Americans as inferior. Would anyone really argue that, in that context, progressives should have opted not to say that white supremacy (a majority sentiment) was wrong? </p> <p>In any case, Islamophobia, like other forms of racism, isn\u2019t merely a moral obscenity. It\u2019s also a material obstacle for those committed to progressive change, undermining unity against our common enemies. How, for instance, do you campaign for workplace rights if your co-workers want to deport you for wearing a headscarf? How do you mobilise people against corporate power if they\u2019re obsessed with banning halal foods?</p> <p>To put it another way, reconstructing a different kind of politics depends on defeating racism, just as much as defeating racism rests on rebuilding a different kind of politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/23/first-dog-on-the-moons-reverse-racist-history-of-australian-racial-intolerance\">First Dog on the Moon's reverse-racist history of Australian racial intolerance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, while popular Islamophobia might sometimes be a cipher for economic uncertainty, that doesn\u2019t mean that activists fighting for economic justice should orient to Islamophobes. On the contrary, precisely because the left\u2019s so weak, attempts to reconstruct a progressive alternative should begin with those who reject bigotry, not those who embrace it.</p> <p>In particular, progressives need to build support among those communities facing the brunt of contemporary racism. How will that ever be possible if we\u2019re not willing to denounce Islamophobia whenever we encounter it?</p> <p>Again, it\u2019s not simply a moral question.</p> <p>Almost as soon as any serious movement gets off the ground, activists will be confronted by questions about national security, Islam, terrorism and the like, simply because those issues are so central to contemporary politics. That\u2019s part of the reason the anti-globalisation movement of the late 90s collapsed: anti-corporate campaigners weren\u2019t prepared for the post-9/11 world.</p> <p>You can\u2019t dodge the key issues of the era \u2013 and, as the Essential Poll shows, one of the key issues today is Islamophobia.</p> <p>Though the survey\u2019s definitely worrying, there\u2019s no reason to conclude the bigots can\u2019t be defeated. But if we\u2019re going to win, we need to actually fight.</p>",

  "<p>Coming to music late in life, Colin Lillie \u2013 the self-proclaimed \u201cgypsy Scotsman\u201d \u2013 took a circuitous route. A murky background rife with drugs and alcohol; an escape from the motherland in order to follow a woman, with whom it ultimately didn\u2019t work out. </p> <p>Lillie ended up in Alice Springs in around 2005, sleeping rough with nowhere to go, but, a few years later, he picked himself up. He met a woman in 2008, who he now calls the love of his life. He started writing songs and, for the first time, he began to sing.</p> <p>Glass Homes is the result of reinvention. It pulsates with a great deal of darkness, infused with love and redemption \u2013 conflicting themes Lillie manages to marry with ease.</p> <p> As a result, it\u2019s also a deeply personal album. In Bloody Knuckles, on which he duets with the singer-songwriter Leanne Tennant, he sings of \u201cthe fear of intimacy after living in the darkness\u201d. In She, Lillie refers to the feminine within him that \u201csoftens the masculine\u201d, that then allowed his life changes to occur. On Damn You, he sings, \u201cWhile you all stand picking on my God with my wrist open sharing my blood / Damn you as you damn me\u201d. </p> <p>On top of their subject matter, a great deal of the power in these songs comes via his voice. This is the centrepiece of Glass Homes. It aches on songs like Neverland and the album closer, Will You. It rumbles menacingly on opener Give Thanks and steps to the front on Brother. It tears at heartstrings on Damn You. At times it evokes Michael Stipe but, for the most part, it\u2019s all Lillie: uniquely rough-hewn and smoke-stained; raw and real.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPBEvGtcRjc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QPBEvGtcRjc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> All of this comes together over a sonic soundscape as varied and undulating as the Scottish Highlands, a constantly shifting stylistic blueprint. Keyboards paint layered backdrops over a melding of acoustic and electric guitars, the surprising addition of a small brass section on Brother adding a sinister edge as he sings, <em>\u201c</em>I walk blindly in the darkness that sets me free\u201d. Cello and viola, used sparingly, add depth.</p> <p>Much credit here is due to producer Mark Myers (The Middle East, Emma Louise). Myers and Lillie spent a good deal of time together over pre-production, reportedly forming a strong artistic bond that has manifested here in a cohesive sound.<strong> </strong>Myers contributes guitar, keys, bass, trumpet and vocals, and guides the album with subtlety and care.</p> <p> With his debut record, Lillie has reached within himself and brought forth something truly special; a glass house is one thing, open for the world to see, but a Glass Home is another entirely.</p>",
  "<p>Rory McIlroy delivered the most powerful Ryder Cup message to the United States yet with a dramatic success at the Tour Championship which also ensured the Northern Irishman claimed the $10m FedEx Cup prize. At the start of Ryder Cup week Europe are the side with momentum. With the purses added together, McIlroy departed Georgia $11.5m richer than when he arrived.</p> <p>After a final round of 64 at East Lake McIlroy prevailed over Ryan Moore in what was the fourth sudden-death play-off hole. As McIlroy converted from 15ft for a birdie, days before taking his place in the European team at Hazeltine, their captain Darren Clarke surely joined with the celebrations. Clarke will inherit a McIlroy brimming with confidence and, once more, holing putts which count.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/24/ian-poulter-ryder-cup-darren-clarke\">Ian Poulter: \u2018I\u2019m not giving up the ghost \u2013 I still have a couple of Ryder Cups in me\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For McIlroy this means a second success on the PGA Tour within a month and taking delivery of the FedEx Cup for the first time. The latter had been a stated ambition of his at the beginning of 2016. Had Moore emerged victorious from the play-off \u2013 which had also included Kevin Chappell for one hole \u2013 then Dustin Johnson would have won that aggregate prize. The bigger picture related to Hazeltine, as McIlroy would have been perfectly well aware.</p> <p>McIlroy\u2019s day had rather trundled along before an epic moment on the 16th during regulation play. There the 27-year-old holed out from 137 yards for eagle. The demonstrated euphoria was as turbo-charged as McIlroy has ever produced. This served as a reminder that, when in his finest touch, McIlroy is the best entertainer in the sport.</p> <p>Yet he still had work to do, with Chappell holding a two-shot lead with only two holes to play. Chappell was to bogey the 17th, with McIlroy erasing the remaining shortfall courtesy of a birdie on the 72nd green which concluded a back nine of 30. On the last McIlroy played a sumptuous greenside bunker shot to tap-in range.</p> <p>Moore, who had matched McIlroy\u2019s Sunday score of six under par, displayed tenacity during the play-off but had no answer to McIlroy\u2019s three on the 16th. The duo had traded both birdies and pars during the earlier holes. For a spell there was a genuine concern as to whether this contest would conclude during daylight hours. Whereas McIlroy was regarded as the favourite, he also carried a record of four defeats in four earlier play-off appearances on the European and PGA Tours. The sense that another such scenario might fall against him had been endorsed by missed opportunities to win in the first two knockout holes. He was ultimately not to be denied, though; for all McIlroy\u2019s widespread popularity there had been a feeling that the East Lake crowd were seeking an American champion.</p> <p>Johnson had started day four when tied for the lead with Chappell. The US Open champion was to slip surprisingly to a 73, leaving his FedEx dreams in the hands of others. \u201cObviously Rory played really great,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cSo obviously hats off to him. He earned it and he deserves it.</p> <p>\u201cIf Ryan would have beat Rory in the play-off, I would have had a chance to win the FedEx Cup, which obviously would have been really cool. But it didn\u2019t feel right because I didn\u2019t win the Tour Championship. That\u2019s why I was here \u2013 to win. I knew I controlled my own destiny.\u201d</p> <p>Chappell, who was seeking his maiden PGA tour victory, had seen McIlroy close-up during a practice match on Wednesday. He admitted to nerves in the sudden-death format but reflected on a \u201clife-changing\u201d season with positivity. It seems inevitable he will sample victory of his own soon.</p> <p>\u201cFinishing with a five, I\u2019m not going to win any golf tournaments,\u201d said Chappell. \u201cI have to learn from it. I will be better next time. I am proud of the way I fought. It just wasn\u2019t enough today. I woke up this morning pretty nauseous but I got myself in a good place before I teed off. I realised how hard it is to win out here but also how good my game is. I gave guys who have been at the top of leaderboards all year all I had.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Mickelson headed for Hazeltine in fine fettle after an inward nine of 29 on Sunday . Mickelson\u2019s 66 was semi-remarkable given the appearance of a triple-bogey seven at the 7th. Mickelson criticised the \u201cdisconnect\u201d between the PGA Tour and the Ryder Cup during post-match media duties. It is the PGA of America which controls Ryder Cup matters.</p> <p>\u201cWhy the Tour set it [the course] up so differently from what we\u2019re going to have next week is a lack of communication and working together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Tour doesn\u2019t own the Ryder Cup, let\u2019s say, or doesn\u2019t work in conjunction with the PGA of America.</p> <p>\u201c The European Tour would never have the set-up be so different the week before the Ryder Cup. We\u2019re not going to have rough like that; this is the worst rough I\u2019ve seen in years. We\u2019re not going to have that rough next week.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Na, who has something of a reputation for playing at snail\u2019s pace, showed it is not always thus by completing 18 holes in two hours as a single at the front of the field. Na subsequently denied he was seeking to change perception.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about that,\u201d said Na. \u201cIt was really just about having fun. I wanted to break par and play well.\u201d By close of play this background chatter was immaterial. The United States cannot say they have not been warned. McIlroy has returned to the form of his life at the perfect moment.</p>"
