Crowd trouble at football was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/west-ham-watford-london-stadium-supporters-violence\" title=\"\">back in the headlines</a> after last week\u2019s Premier League game against Watford. There was fighting with away fans, who were poorly segregated, and in the lower tiers West Ham supporters fought each other. On Friday 20 fans were banned and had their season tickets revoked.</p> <p>\u201cI was disgusted, ashamed to be a West Ham fan,\u201d said lifetime follower Ciro Castaldo, who stood near one of the troublespots. So why are so many fans losing their temper and self-control? Why are parents saying they feel so unsafe they cannot take their children to games? Why are West Ham beset by spectator problems after signing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/west-ham-olympic-stadium-club-pay-per-season-rent\" title=\"\">best stadium deal in living memory</a>, whereby they pay only \u00a32.5m a year to lease a stadium built with taxpayers\u2019 money?</p> <p>There are no simple answers, but poor planning, poor stewarding, pig-headedness among some supporters, and even popcorn have all played a part. While practical issues are largely to blame, some fans cite a wider problem of the creeping gentrification of football.</p> <p>For former Manchester United captain Roy Keane in 2000 <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=roy%20keane%20prawn%20sndwiches%20guardian\" title=\"\">it was fans eating prawn sandwiches</a>. For West Ham\u2019s more robust supporters in 2016 it is popcorn, which is on sale around the stadium. \u201cPopcorn? What have they done to West Ham\u2019s soul?\u201d was one fan\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/westham_central/status/763429282475630596\" title=\"\">reaction on social media</a>.</p> <p>Standing up at football matches in England\u2019s top two divisions is illegal. The Premier League has no intention of making any changes, and a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: \u201cThe government currently has no plans to change its position and introduce standing accommodation at grounds covered by the all-seater requirement.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is that tens of thousands do stand up every weekend, and have done for years. Stewards, and the clubs that employ them, turn a blind eye. At West Ham\u2019s former home, the Boleyn Ground, usually known as Upton Park, an entire section stood up at every game for more than 10 years.</p> <p>They were in the lower section of the Bobby Moore Stand, named after the club\u2019s most famous player. Now they stand up in the Bobby Moore Stand in the new stadium, but West Ham sold seats in that section to people who did not know about the tradition. There are arguments. Children often cannot see.</p> <p>Children are all over the stadium. The club\u2019s family section has 1,400 seats, but there are 25,000 family members. After offering junior season tickets for \u00a399, West Ham has more under-16s, around 10,000, than any other club. That would explain the presence of popcorn. \u201cWe are very proud to have so many families and children attending our games,\u201d said a club spokesman.</p> <p>\u201cIn some ways the old regulars, the authentic fans, feel threatened,\u201d said <a href=\"https://hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pete May</a>, author of a forthcoming book <em>Goodbye to Boleyn</em>. \u201cStanding up and singing is the only link they\u2019ve got with the old West Ham, and they\u2019re worried it\u2019s going to disappear in the creeping commercialisation and the 60,000 crowds. They don\u2019t want to change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The potential for growth is clear, but West Ham are an East End club, not a Chelsea or an Arsenal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Iain Dale, the political blogger, former Conservative candidate, radio presenter and West Ham fan, said: \u201cThose who do stand now, they\u2019re just being selfish. We all stand up at times, when we have a corner, for example. It\u2019s part of the football experience. But standing throughout the game, they ruin it for others. If you have kids behind you, why would you do that?\u201d</p> <p>Peter Caton, 55, is among those who stand up at every game. He is one of the many fans who blame Karren Brady, the club\u2019s vice-chairman, for \u201criding roughshod over supporters\u2019 wishes\u201d by moving the club to the new home.</p> <p>West Ham are among the 20 richest clubs in the world. Their move has added 22,000 seats to matchday income and their supporters, too, are wealthy \u2013 \u201cright at the top in terms of highest average income\u201d, according to Dale. The potential for growth is clear, but West Ham are an East End club, not a Chelsea or an Arsenal.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are standing their ground quite literally,\u201d said Caton. \u201cWest Ham has a core of working-class support and Brady wants to turn us into Arsenal. But we\u2019re not Arsenal. There was no proper consultation of fans before we moved. They\u2019ll have to carry me out if they want me to sit down, and I won\u2019t come back.\u201d</p> <p>There are more complaints about the lack of pubs near the stadium \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a half-hour walk\u201d said May \u2013 and the pre-match eateries at Westfield are way upmarket from old Upton Park favourites. \u201cThe food outlets are all very different and the whole experience of the Olympic Stadium will appeal more to a middle-class audience than working-class,\u201d said Dale.</p> <p>\u201cBut if you ignore the trouble for a moment, it is the most amazing stadium, every seat has a good view. The negative stories need to be balanced out by the fact that most people like the place. When we start playing well again a lot of problems will ebb away.\u201d</p> <p>Others from around England will see the bitterness as another example of the distancing of elite football from \u201creal\u201d fans. It was an affordable sport watched by largely working-class fans before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Hillsborough disaster</a> brought an end to terraces, before Nick Hornby\u2019s <em>Fever Pitch</em>, the Premier League (25 years old next year), the Sky Sports stranglehold, and Keane\u2019s \u201cprawn sandwich\u201d outburst.</p> <p>By the end of the 1980s, wrote Andrew Hussey in an essay on Hillsborough for the <em>New Statesman</em>, football fans \u201chad become the object of scorn and derision. To be working class, to be a football fan \u2026 was to be scum\u201d. Many working-class fans have felt marginalised ever since.</p> <p>But while Premier League stadiums are nearly 97% full every week you will not find many in the boardrooms harking back to 30 years ago when the <em>Sunday Times</em> said football was \u201ca slum sport played in slum stadiums and increasingly watched by slum people\u201d.</p> <p>And there can be no complaints about ticket prices at West Ham. While Chelsea fans must pay \u00a356, plus a membership fee, even for the cheapest match seat, and Liverpool fans felt obliged to stage a walkout protest over price hikes in February, West Ham sold season tickets for \u00a3289 \u2013 around \u00a315 a game. \u201cThe club have done a really good job of keeping the prices down,\u201d said Dale. \u201cA lot of fans who were priced out at Upton Park can now afford to come, and I see a lot more black and Asian faces in the crowd.\u201d</p> <p>There was, he said, a divide between the old-style fans and some of those 22,000 newcomers. \u201cOld\u201d fans believe the \u201cnew\u201d fans leave games early, return to seats late after half-time popcorn forays, and never stand up and sing.

Tory MPs loyal to the old order, and those dismissed from government by May, feel bruised and talk carefully but deliberately, in code. \u201cBold to say the least,\u201d said one sacked minister last week, raising his eyebrows and adding that he was \u201cone of a lot of people who she needs to vote with her on things\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday in the Commons, the new education secretary, Justine Greening, gave details <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/14/why-does-theresa-may-want-to-bring-back-grammar-schools-video-explainer\" title=\"\">of the prime minister\u2019s grammar school revolution.</a> \u201cWe do not want to see a return to the old binary system of good schools and bad schools,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery child deserves a place in a great \u2026\u201d The Speaker had to intervene as the opposition benches erupted, asking where her mandate for more grammar schools was.

First to his feet was former Tory education secretary Kenneth Clarke, who asked Greening to make sure that \u201cthis change does not damage the opportunities for pupils in other schools and does not distract priority from raising the standards of all schools for all pupils which has been the objective of this government\u201d.</p> <p>Nicky Morgan, sacked by May as education secretary, voiced her worries, as did the normally restrained Tory chair of the education select committee, Neil Carmichael. \u201cThere is no desire in my constituency for us to have selection,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/15/anna-soubry-sacked-as-theresa-may-carries-out-evening-reshuffle/\" title=\"\">another dismissed minister, Anna Soubry</a>, before former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers weighed in.

As it was, David Cameron chose Monday to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\" title=\"\">announce that he was standing down as an MP</a>. The former PM insisted that he was not going in a huff because May was trashing his policies but because he did not want to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d. May had \u201cgot off to a cracking start\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Two months into her premiership, Theresa May\u2019s poll ratings remain in honeymoon territory. She is seen by most voters as a reassuring presence and a strong and competent leader, while the ratings for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are dire. She is also seen as slightly less rightwing than Cameron, and her chancellor, Philip Hammond, as a little to the left of his predecessor&#xa0;Osborne.</p> <p>Before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister\" title=\"\">she entered Downing Street for the first time on 13 July, </a>May said her government would not be driven \u201cby the interests of the privileged few\u201d but by those who had had little or none. \u201cWe will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls, we\u2019ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws we\u2019ll listen not to the mighty, but to you. When it comes to taxes, we\u2019ll prioritise not the wealthy but you.\u201d She was clear, then, that the days of government by the \u201cNotting Hill set\u201d were over. But few expected her to move so fast and so boldly. Her supporters insist that a clear theme to her leadership is already emerging, much of it shaped by her chief of staff, the pro-grammar school Nick Timothy.</p> <p>Unlike the Cameron inner circle, from which May felt excluded, they say she wants not just to show that she cares about \u201cthe bottom 10%, but all those who deserve a chance\u201d. One ally said: \u201cTo her, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/george-osborne-to-chair-northern-powerhouse-partnership\" title=\"\">northern powerhouse looked like a gesture</a>, like it was just about being generous to the north. She wants to prioritise the whole country. If you understand that, you begin to understand her.\u201d</p> <p>Writing on these pages, Phillip Blond, the inventor of one-nation red-Toryism who became disillusioned with Cameron, says May is developing a new post-liberal Conservatism that challenges the idea of so much power and wealth being concentrated in the hands of the elite. For Blond and other \u201ccommunitarian\u201d conservative thinkers, the hope is that the May era will herald an end to laissez-faire economics and usher in an era of proactive government, dedicated to building a more inclusive society. Quite how her approach to grammar schools will help all children, however, is a question being asked by far more Tory MPs than are needed to kill her flagship education plan stone dead in the Commons. The Cameroons are not happy and joke that her biggest achievement in office so far has been to unite Labour over grammar schools in a way it could not have managed itself.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/george-osborne-to-chair-northern-powerhouse-partnership\" title=\"\">Osborne has launched an organisation to reboot the northern powerhouse idea.</a> Last week, at an event hosted by the pollsters Opinium and the Social Market Foundation, Nicky Morgan suggested May would lack the appeal to centre-ground voters that Cameron had.</p> <p>With Brexit to deal with, a majority of 17 and no direct mandate of her own, Theresa May may soon realise the downside of taking risks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"db1cfa10b4d3c7c34bd80b2c7680e525d155ddd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db1cfa10b4d3c7c34bd80b2c7680e525d155ddd7/0_73_4456_2673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne\u2019s plan to abolish the deficit was among the first Cameron policy to be jettisoned.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Osborne\u2019s plan to abolish the deficit was among the first Cameron policy to be jettisoned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>CAMERON REFORMS BEING REVERSED</strong></h2> <p><strong>THE DEFICIT </strong></p> <p>The Tory election manifesto in May 2015 was clear: \u201cThe way to keep our economy secure for the future is to eliminate the deficit entirely and start running a surplus. Anything less would be to ignore the lessons of the past.\u201d Then came Brexit, out went David Cameron and George Osborne and all that changed. Even before becoming leader, Theresa May said she would no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by 2020, abandoning Osborne\u2019s pledge to more than balance the books by the next election. In July, his successor as chancellor, Phillip Hammond, went further, saying his first autumn statement would be a chance to \u201creset fiscal policy\u201d. The statement is expected to mark an end to austerity \u2013 with which Osborne will always be associated \u2013 and usher in an era of more state investment to boost the economy, improve infrastructure and create jobs.</p> <p><strong>NORTHERN POWERHOUSE </strong></p> <p>On Friday, Osborne said May\u2019s government had had \u201ca wobble\u201d on his plans for a northern powerhouse. But he claimed through gritted teeth that it was now \u201c100% committed\u201d. However, that overstated the reality. May made it clear on entering No 10 that she wanted a broader, nationwide industrial strategy rather than merely a \u201cnorthern\u201d one \u2013 an approach that covered the whole country. Initially, she even seemed reluctant to use the term \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, reflecting her clear reservations and suggesting that she thought it was a something of a stunt. To keep the flame of the policy, which he launched in 2014, very much alive Osborne announced on Friday that he would chair a new organisation to advance the plans, including greater devolution of powers.</p> <p><strong>OBESITY </strong></p> <p>May\u2019s government has come under fire from the BMA, the Tory chair of the health select committee, Dr Sarah Wollaston, and celebrity chef, Jamie Oliver, for watering down plans for an ambitious anti-obesity strategy. Professor Parveen Kumar, chair of the BMA\u2019s board of science, said the government had \u201crowed back on its promises by announcing what looks like a weak plan, rather than the robust strategy it promised\u201d. Given concerns that NHS bills are soaring as a result of obesity, the government left itself open to attack. It said food companies would not be compelled to reduce levels of sugar in products but would be subject to voluntary targets. Kumar said this approach would be \u201cpointless\u201d. Wollaston said the plans showed \u201cthe hand of big industry lobbyists\u201d. Ministers said the plans, including a voluntary target to cut sugar in children\u2019s food and drink, were bold and announced new measures to try to expand sporting provision in primary schools.</p> <p><strong>GRAMMAR SCHOOLS </strong></p> <p>David Cameron said in 2006 that he did not want a return to selection. \u201cThe prospect of bringing back grammar schools has always been wrong and I\u2019ve never supported it. And I don\u2019t think any Conservative government would have done it.\u201d Instead, his administration sought to raise standards across the state sector by increasing school autonomy through the expansion of academies and Michael Gove\u2019s free schools project. May changed tack unexpectedly, prompting a huge row and raising concerns among many of her MPs. \u201cFor too long, we have tolerated a system that contains an arbitrary rule preventing selective schools from being established \u2013 sacrificing children\u2019s potential because of dogma and ideology,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth is that we already have selection in our school system \u2013 and it\u2019s selection by house price, selection by wealth. That is simply unfair.\u201d</p> <p><strong>HOUSING</strong></p> <p>May\u2019s housing minister, Gavin Barwell, hinted strongly in a speech that the government would shift its focus from home ownership to helping those in the rented sector. \u201cWe need to build more homes of every single type and not focus on one single tenure,\u201d he said in terms that were seen in the housing industry as softening it up for a change of direction. Barwell appeared to recognise that many of those most in need are renters, who desire more security and protection. He also suggested that the government could ditch plans to build 200,000 \u201cstarter homes\u201d by 2020 \u2013 a plan that has been widely criticised on the grounds that such homes, although supposedly for those on low incomes, would turn out to be unaffordable for the less well off.</p> <p><strong>PRISON REFORMS </strong></p> <p>The new justice secretary, Liz Truss, threw Gove\u2019s plans for sweeping reforms of prisons in England and Wales into huge doubt within weeks of entering office. Under Gove\u2019s plans, prisons would have gained more control over budgets and how they were run. Truss said she was \u201cnot committing\u201d to such legislation. The Ministry of Justice insisted it was still \u201ctotally committed\u201d to prison reform although what emerges is likely to be Truss\u2019s blueprint. She told the Commons justice committee that she wanted to speed up the pace of change, including giving governors greater autonomy, as Gove suggested, but was looking at the \u201coverall system\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"94632e3beb4b44744444a140863c6d98bf8d974f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94632e3beb4b44744444a140863c6d98bf8d974f/1190_237_1166_1456/801.jpg\" alt=\"Phillip Blond\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillip Blond</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephane Grangier - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>WHAT THE ANALYSTS SAY</h2> <p><strong>PHILLIP BLOND, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE-RIGHT RESPUBLICA</strong> <strong>THINKTANK</strong></p> <p>To chart the direction of the Conservative party under Theresa May, one need only point out the differences between her and David Cameron.</p> <p>Cameron unfortunately (and despite the early PR) turned out to be quite conventional. He was both an economic liberal and a social liberal, whereas I suspect May is neither. This does not make her a reactionary, but potentially somebody who can be revolutionary and can create a transformative and good post-liberal politics.</p> <p>Across the west, the failure of the liberal elite (both left and right) to recognise the damage liberalism has wrought has provoked all manner of reactionary politics, from Trump in the US to Le Pen in France. Yet we have failed to identify the cause \u2013 ever more extreme liberalism. On liberalism\u2019s watch, we have seen a massive concentration of wealth and power; whereas socially, we have witnessed the dismissal and humiliation of working-class people, coupled with the mindless endorsement of mass migration, as if we could replace the servile class with those more compliant. Unless we develop a non-regressive form of politics, the future promises to be more primitive and inhabited by racists, nationalists and perhaps fascists, because the conventional centre is empty, outmoded and has nothing to offer.</p> <p>That is why I have great hopes for May \u2013 she has the right targets and doesn\u2019t believe in old solutions. From recognising that infrastructure such as Hinkley Point shouldn\u2019t just go to the highest bidder but that government should retain a veto, to the idea that the poor, like the middle class, should have access to excellent schools.</p> <p>Expect more of the same, from mutualising infrastructure such as railways, to creating assets and savings for working people. I can also imagine her remodelling migration on the basis of shared values and integration, so as to draw its poison and keep Britain open to the world. In short, May is post-liberal, and that could be the most progressive politics we have had in decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0ecd063c0ab6b1dafced8153c94db0ec31d61696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ecd063c0ab6b1dafced8153c94db0ec31d61696/445_1146_1137_1420/801.jpg\" alt=\"David Green\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Green</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>DAVID GREEN, DIRECTOR OF THE CIVITAS THINKTANK</strong></p> <p>Is Mayism different? Thatcherism was dominated by the view that freedom was the absence of government, which implied reducing the scope of the state by deregulating and privatising.</p> <p>For Mayism, freedom is a political achievement. If everyone is to have a share in prosperity, then it requires active government, not least in the form of a \u201cproper industrial strategy\u201d.</p> <p>Cameronism was more about image building than problem solving. Putting forward policy ideas under him might have got the reaction: \u201cThat\u2019s a good line, I can use that in a speech.\u201d Not so now. Mayism is different because it recognises that globalisation has not delivered for everyone. During the EU debate, Tories such as Boris Johnson criticised globalisation as manifested in the \u201cfour freedoms\u201d of the EU. They have little to do with personal freedom. Rather, they are the doctrines of laissez-faire economics, which lumps together four different things. Goods and services are produced with buying and selling in mind; but labour and money are not primarily commodities.</p> <p>Gordon Brown used to argue that the free movement of labour was counter-inflationary, which could only be the result of lowering wages. Now Theresa May defines the lowering of wages as a problem. Too much immigration makes it harder for people to make ends meet and achieve their personal best.</p> <p>The unexpected commitment to grammar schools comes from the same philosophical root. To be free is to be able to develop your talents to the full, but active government is needed to give everyone a fighting chance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71a4b1302777f54af4050e56edd37e3c21ffbe93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71a4b1302777f54af4050e56edd37e3c21ffbe93/1969_524_2653_3316/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ayesha Hazarika\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ayesha Hazarika</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sent by her</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>AYESHA HAZARIKA, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER ADVISER TO HARRIET HARMAN AND ED MILIBAND</strong></p> <p>Theresa May is no novice.

Why? The obvious reason is because she is trying to put clear water between her and Cameron. But there is more to it than that.She will know how critical the first big moments are for a new prime minister. Your first words on the steps of Downing Street. Your first PMQs. Your first hires and fires. And critically, your first fight.</p> <p>She knows the grammar school row will not be easy. Many on her own side hate it.

  "<p>Kristian Jensen, Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, gave a precise response last week to a request by Russia for the nations to enter bilateral talks over the ownership of the north pole. He flatly rejected the move. \u201cWe need to apply the international rules,\u201d he told reporters.</p> <p>The Russian request and the swift Danish response are intriguing. The United Nations is currently assessing Russian, Danish and Canadian claims to own sizeable chunks of the Arctic seabed. The Russian move was generally viewed as an attempt to strike a deal that would cut out Canada, while Denmark appears to believe its case is strong enough to exclude such manoeuvres.</p> <p>One thing is clear. The Arctic is heating up in meteorological, political and environmental terms as nations fall over themselves to exploit the region.</p> <p>Apart from Denmark\u2019s rebuff of Russia\u2019s Arctic overtures, Canadian explorers announced last week they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt\">discovered the wreck of HMS Terror</a>, one of the two ships belonging to British explorer Sir John Franklin\u2019s doomed attempt to sail the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific. (The other expedition ship, Erebus, was discovered two years ago.) These two vessels have enormous symbolic importance because Canada believes they support its claim to own the passage, which other nations, such as the US, argue is international waters.</p> <p>Then there were the recent moves by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt\">China to invest in mines in Greenland</a>, where declining ice cover is exposing vast outcrops of ores, including minerals crucial to mobile phone manufacture.

Summer sea ice, which once covered 7.5 million sq km around the north pole, this year dropped to 4.13m sq km, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-second-lowest-level-ever-recorded\">its second lowest figure on record, it was announced.</a> The rate of annual change \u2013 brought about by soaring fossil fuel emissions and rises in global temperatures \u2013 is now equivalent to a loss greater than the size of Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cLoss of sea ice has local to global effects, from animals and ecosystems to encouraging further warming by exposing ocean water,\u201d said Twila Moon, at Bristol University. \u201cWe should all be shocked by the dramatic changes happening in the Arctic.\u201d</p> <p>Most scientists now expect that, at current emission rates, the Arctic will be reliably free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of the century. By \u201cfree\u201d they mean there will be less than 1m sq km of sea ice left in the Arctic, most of it packed into remote bays and channels while the central Arctic Ocean over the north pole will be completely open. And by \u201creliably\u201d, scientists mean there will have been five consecutive years with less than 1m sq km of ice by the year 2050. The first single ice-free year will come much earlier than this, however.</p> <p>\u201cThe Arctic is opening up, and all sorts of flashpoints lie ahead,\u201d said Klaus Dodds, professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London. \u201cIf the central Arctic Ocean is freed of ice for several months a year, who will control the fishing and the dumping of waste there? The Russians have also made it clear they want to drill for oil and gas.\u201d</p> <p>This point was also stressed by Professor Chris Rapley, of University College London. \u201cAn increasingly ice-free Arctic is a geopolitical game changer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Already there are profound changes, with invasive species pouring into the warming Arctic and threatening existing populations, according to Melanie Lancaster of WWF\u2019s Arctic programme. \u201cSpecialised Arctic species such as polar bears [are already] showing signs of stress. Conservation action is urgently needed.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Arctic, its wildlife and its four million inhabitants face a major handicap: the region\u2019s lack of centralised protection and control. The Antarctic Treaty bans all mining, oil drilling or the presence of the military and strictly monitors all environmental hazards around the south pole. By contrast, although no nation owns the north pole, the Arctic nations \u2013 Russia, Canada, the United States, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark \u2013 have very different ideas about how to run the world\u2019s most northerly regions.</p> <p>\u201cArctic environmental protection is currently determined by individual nations, by politicians who often meet far from its borders: in Moscow, Copenhagen and Washington,\u201d said Professor Michael Byers of the University of British Columbia. \u201cThey have very different levels of commitment to protecting the environment \u2013 with Russia at the bottom and the Nordic nations at the top.\u201d</p> <p>And it is not just the Arctic nations who are eyeing up the riches around the north pole. China recently assigned itself the status of being \u201ca near-Arctic state\u201d. It views the opening Arctic seas as an opportunity to maintain its access to the world\u2019s most important resources. Some of the Earth\u2019s major stocks of fish are migrating north as the planet heats up while the Arctic\u2019s mineral resources are being exposed by retreating ice.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese have made no secret that they have their eyes on the Arctic\u2019s fish and minerals,\u201d said Dodds.</p> <p>This raises the question of what the Inuit and other Arctic people think about resources being exploited by others. \u201cThey are not against resource development but they do like to be consulted and involved,\u201d said Dodds. \u201cThey do not want to be cheated. However, there are often disagreements within communities about the choices they have to make. Will a mining development ruin a village\u2019s tourist potential, for example?\u201d</p> <p>Byers was cautious. \u201cI have enormous sympathy for the local peoples in the Arctic but they are few in number and have limited resources. They are trying to insert themselves into the decision-making of some of the most powerful companies and countries in the world,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Relations with indigenous people are one of the flashpoints that may trigger serious disputes in the region. There is already bitterness among the Inuit about their treatment in the past and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada is currently investigating the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/06/canada-dark-of-history-residential-schools\">serious abuse that thousands of children received</a> in residential schools last century. That resentment could colour future attempts to develop the region.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f9af48e883d9b7e7812481e9d4e332aefe28634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f9af48e883d9b7e7812481e9d4e332aefe28634/0_210_5184_3111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Greenland government is trying to balance the discovery of minerals and other new opportunities brought on by climate change with the old ways of doing things.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Greenland government is trying to balance the discovery of minerals and other new opportunities brought on by climate change with the old ways of doing things.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of all the Arctic nations, Russia has been the most determined to exploit the region as it warms, however. \u201cYou can see that determination in the way it responded to the Arctic 30 incident,\u201d said Duncan Depledge, Director, All-Party Parliamentary Group for Polar Regions Secretariat. In 2013, Greenpeace activists attempted to scale the Prirazlomnaya drilling platform as part of a protest against Arctic oil production. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/19/greenpeace-protesters-arrested-arctic\">Russians arrested them at gunpoint</a> and charged the activists initially with piracy and later with hooliganism and only released them after two months of detention. \u201cThat is an indication of how seriously they take the Arctic,\u201d added Depledge.</p> <p>This point was backed by Dodds: \u201cThe Russians are hell bent on showing the world they mean business here.\u201d</p> <p>Could that determination lead to an outbreak of hostilities? Byers was not convinced. \u201cThe Arctic is a very expensive region in which to operate and Russia is not a wealthy country. The cost of militarising the Arctic would be prohibitive. They might want to police it so that they can control outfits like Greenpeace but I don\u2019t see them having a war with another Arctic nation.\u201d</p> <p>The implications for the region are still worrying, nevertheless. As Rapley stated: \u201cThe ongoing thinning [of Arctic summer sea ice] is especially significant and the implications are profound. The Arctic nations are jostling for advantage, and the economic and ecological consequences of new trade routes opening up have yet to unfold. The changes that have occurred have been greater and faster than predicted. The planet is sending a clear message: time is running out.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Two years ago today the people of Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. David Cameron, the then prime minister, breathed a huge sigh of relief. But fast forward to 23 June, the day of the European Union referendum, and his luck finally ran out.</p> <p>Never in our peacetime history have so many dials required resetting as a consequence of a single day\u2019s events. Cameron has gone and so that task falls to Theresa May. The shift in the UK\u2019s place in the world is comparable only to the disposal of the British Empire \u2013 which took place over many years and to a timetable largely under the control of British ministers. It left remarkably few psychological scars. By comparison, 23 June was guillotine day.</p> <p>The referendum was a shock to the political system and our constitutional framework. But that framework was already shifting. Since May 2010 we have had two UK-wide referendums \u2013 on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum,_2011\" title=\"\">voting system</a> and on EU membership \u2013 and a third where, although the question was limited to the voters of Scotland, the potential impact on the whole of the UK was considerable.</p> <p>We have seen the introduction of fixed-term parliaments and of police and crime commissioners. Local authorities have seen their role in education, housing and social care eroded. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/30/osborne-launches-national-infrastructure-commission\" title=\"\">national infrastructure commission</a> has been established to speed up major projects in transport and other areas. The fabric of local accountability and control is shifting. There is talk of devolving power away from Whitehall and Westminster to local level, including further directly elected mayors.</p> <p>A lot of change and more to come, but these issues have not been shaped by any constitutional master plan. Under Cameron, they seemed to be a reactive, piecemeal process, in response to short-term political pressures.</p> <p>And what about the issues that have <em>not</em> been raised? The government\u2019s devolution concessions in Scotland have inevitably led to questions from Wales and the regions of England. While the Blair government showed its reforming credentials in devolution, limited reforms to the Lords and the introduction of a London mayor, most of England was unaffected.</p> <p>And while turnout in the EU referendum was high, turnout in elections \u2013 even general elections \u2013 is far lower than 30 years ago. When the voters do bother to vote, they are increasingly less inclined to support the two big brands at Westminster. The minor parties \u2013 the Greens, Ukip and the nationalists \u2013 are now in the ascendancy.</p> <p>Our democratic process \u2013 indeed, our democracy \u2013 is drifting. It is time to have a broader look at how we conduct the business of democratic representative government. We need to shape a system that is better understood and which commands the electorate\u2019s confidence.</p> <p>If we had been writing this article in an earlier age, the words royal commission would have appeared long before now. Forty years ago, a royal commission was the response of choice to a wide range of issues: anything from trade unions to medical education to gambling.</p> <p>But the fact that past commissions achieved less than expected does not mean we should automatically reject the idea. Indeed, they could be just the type of life raft that the new prime minister needs. We believe there is now a case for a royal commission to consider the design and operation of our democratic processes, as well as the internal relationships between the nations and regions of the UK.</p> <p>There are 10 big issues:</p> <p>\u2022 What can be done to improve the effectiveness of legislators in the House of Commons and their response to the concerns of voters?</p> <p>\u2022 What should be the future relationships between the two Houses of Parliament?</p> <p>\u2022 Is devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland working as well as it could, and how should we respond to proposals for a second Scottish referendum on independence?</p> <p>\u2022 Is there now a case for devolution to England, either to the country as a whole or to the regions? If so, in what form?</p> <p>\u2022 What changes are needed in local government? What should its role be in education, housing, transport and health (including a possible combined health and social care system)?</p> <p>\u2022 How could the structure of central government (the \u201cmachinery of government\u201d) be reshaped to make it more responsive to the needs of the population?</p> <p>\u2022 Is there a case for new arrangements to improve democratic accountability of the public bodies overseeing important local services such as NHS trusts or non-departmental public bodies \u2013 or even more direct scrutiny by parliament and its select committees?</p> <p>\u2022 Should major constitutional decisions, such as calling referendums, be removed from the pressing concerns of politicians and vested in a new independent constitutional review body, or perhaps subjected to a \u201csuper majority\u201d in parliament?</p> <p>\u2022 What could be done to increase participation in the democratic process (such as voting at the age of 16, electronic voting, elections on Sundays, polling stations at supermarkets and so on)?</p> <p>\u2022 How can we address the legitimate concerns about tax avoidance and tax havens under the British crown?</p> <p>Some of these areas have been looked at before but usually only in isolation. Few of the proposals which have emerged have made much headway. In the uncertain future we now face, it is time to look at them in the round. We need to make our systems fit and proper for the 21st century.</p> <p>The UK has long prided itself on punching above its weight in the world. The Brexit decision requires us to reconsider our position in the new global order. But first we need to look with urgency at how the mechanisms in our system work together. This requires us to focus with intensity and urgency on how we want our democratic processes to work. We are confident that the UK has the resources and the energy to do that, and that the establishment of a royal commission on the constitution would assist that process. We hope the new prime minister agrees.</p> <p><em>Alun Evans, chief executive of the British Academy, was director of the Scotland Office from 2012-2015.

  "<p>Asked by Bloomberg this month about Russian involvement in the hacking of the US Democratic national committee, Vladimir Putin issued a non-denial denial. Basically, his answer boiled down to this: whoever did it did a good thing. This response only added to the stir created by the initial accusation that Russia was behind the activities of the \u201cFancy Bears\u201d. The fear of Russia manipulating presidential elections in the world\u2019s mightiest democracy has been spreading across the United States.</p> <p>Getting to the real perpetrators of hacking attacks is notoriously difficult. Yet seen from the Kremlin hackers perform a valuable public service by revealing secrets \u2013 not to foreign intelligence services, but to the western public. The political power of these revelations was first demonstrated by WikiLeaks, which broke the confidentiality of US diplomatic cables. The effect was much enhanced by the Snowden files, which exposed, <em>inter alia</em>, US spying on other western leaders.</p> <p>Information warfare has become, alongside geo-economics (sanctions and counter-sanctions), one of the principal battlefields in the new confrontation between Russia and the west.</p> <p>Some cases look like direct tit-for-tats. The exposure of the Democratic national committee leadership secretly supporting one candidate against another and thus rigging the primary vote appears as payback for Hillary Clinton\u2019s diatribes against Russia\u2019s own flawed parliamentary elections of December 2011. The opening of World Anti-Doping Agency medical files shows that US Olympic champions did take banned drugs, while Russian athletes were banned <em>en masse</em> from participating in the Rio Games.</p> <p>However, all this is just the tip of the iceberg. It may seem that all Russia is doing is trying to get even and making its accusers appear guilty of the same crimes with which they charge Moscow. There is a big difference, though. Russian public life is permeated with cynicism. The president is a tsar. Elections are about confirming rulers in power, not changing them: \u201cYou first get into the Kremlin, and then I\u2019ll vote for you.\u201d People get rich not before they enter government service or after they leave it, but while they are in government. Law is a tool of the high and mighty. This cynicism has its limits, and the Russian people\u2019s proverbial patience may suddenly snap, but their level of tolerance is generally high. By contrast, western political systems have become used to more than a fair share of hypocrisy. Call it political correctness, or values, or ideology, but western societies are more vulnerable to the exposure of wrongdoing and abuse which is not individual but systemic, particularly when it comes to democracy.</p> <p>It is one thing for the Russian people to be told that their vote has been stolen; it is totally different for the American electorate to believe, as Donald Trump has suggested, that presidential elections can be rigged. And democracy is again becoming an issue all over the European Union and America.</p> <p>Putin certainly sees the widening gulf separating western elites from their disgruntled co-citizens, left behind in the process of globalisation and unrestrained money-making, and \u2013 insult to injury \u2013 branded \u201cdeplorable\u201d. He also notes that the triumph of democracy over communism three decades ago has led to the political systems of Europe and America essentially eschewing any meaningful competition within those systems.</p> <p>With inequality on the rise, this only leads to dissent and challenge emerging from outside the established systems and against them. As someone who is now locked in a battle with the US political establishment, he closely studies the state of his adversary and draws conclusions from it.</p> <p>One conclusion which might surprise him is the notion that he can manipulate not just European politicians but also American elections, and lead, single-handedly, a global challenge against the existing liberal democratic order. By now Putin paranoia has reached a level far above the occasional playing of the \u201cRussia card\u201d against the opponent. This betrays a degree of uncertainty among the ruling elites of the western world which one could not imagine even a few years ago. This uncertainty is not necessarily good for Russia, as the risks tend to mount, but it surely can and will be exploited in the ongoing great power struggle.</p> <p>There are many lessons to be drawn from the demise of the Soviet Union a quarter of a century ago. One is that imperial hubris is eventually punished; another is that attempts to bring a supposedly advanced political system to a nation unprepared for it usually ends in failure, and that the elites who get too far away from their public are caught up with the reality when it is already too late.</p> <p>Modern western nations are not like the USSR, but their leaders might wish to consider that, in the end, what killed the Soviet system was not Reagan\u2019s Star Wars, or even the scarcity of goods in the shops; the people in that part of the world had known worse. What actually did it was the loss of public faith in the domestic political system. So, improve or beware of exposure.</p> <p> <em>Dmitri Trenin is director of the Carnegie Moscow Center</em></p>",
  "<p>The outbreak of anti-German sentiment in Britain that greeted the news that Queen Victoria was to marry Prince Albert rang unpleasantly familiar bells for the author of ITV\u2019s new hit costume drama, <em>Victoria</em>, when she researched Sunday night\u2019s episode.</p> <p>\u201cI wrote these scenes long before the Brexit vote, but it did feel uncannily prescient when I saw it again on screen. I was slightly horrified and quite depressed by it really. Our Little Englander suspicions have been around a long time,\u201d said writer Daisy Goodwin.</p> <p>The former television producer, who has enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/the-week-in-tv-victoria-collection-night-of-are-you-being-served-porridge-till-death-us-do-part\" title=\"\">critical acclaim </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/05/itvs-victoria-narrowly-beats-poldark-return\" title=\"\">high audience ratings</a> in the past few weeks for her first television series, which stars Jenna Coleman as the young queen, said this weekend she had been surprised to find British prejudice against Germans had roots far further back than she had guessed.</p> <p>\u201cI had thought a lot of the anti-German feeling in this country started with the first world war but, as I read around, I found it had been here a long time by then,\u201d she said.</p> <p>After studying the newspapers and parliamentary debates of the era, Goodwin tried to reflect the public mood in her dramatic version of the months leading up to Victoria and Albert\u2019s wedding in February 1840.</p> <p>Scenes in Sunday night\u2019s episode will show politicians, including the Duke of Wellington, expressing fears that a foreign country might gain sway over the British empire, while the young Queen\u2019s advisor, prime minister Lord Melbourne, played by Rufus Sewell, attempts to reassure his peers. But concerns were not limited to Westminster.</p> <p>\u201cThere were lots of cartoons at the time of Albert as a sausage. He really was fighting against a prejudice that was not of his making,\u201d said Goodwin, in support of her fictionalised account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"157901350d282e4e6f7e350e138f858c7ced9f97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/157901350d282e4e6f7e350e138f858c7ced9f97/0_193_3104_3880/800.jpg\" alt=\"Daisy Goodwin, the writer of Victoria.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daisy Goodwin, the writer of Victoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hansard parliamentary records for January 1840 show that after the Queen formally stated her intention of \u201callying myself in marriage with the Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg and Gotha\u201d, she was quick to ask for an income for her future husband.</p> <p>\u201cThe constant proofs which I have received of your attachment to my person and family persuade me that you will enable me to provide for such an establishment as may appear suitable to the rank of the prince and the dignity of the crown,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She was right to want clarification: parliament was not keen to offer her groom either a title or a large state allowance. Instead MPs were mainly concerned to reassure themselves and the public that he was not a Catholic gold-digger.</p> <p>Lord Seaford\u2019s kinder comments recorded in Hansard reveal the patriarchal attitudes of the age: \u201cIt was impossible, considering the age and sex of the sovereign, that their lordships could consider this event drily, as a mere political alliance, or without feelings of the most anxious solicitude as to its influence upon the future domestic happiness of her majesty.\u201d</p> <p>Goodwin was interested to see that popular prejudice against Germans took a different form in Victoria\u2019s day. Far from being caricatured as officious and expansionist, they were ridiculed as chaotic and ill-educated.</p> <p>\u201cGermany did not really exist as a country \u2013 it was a collection of principalities,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were thought of as a ramshackle country that was rather low grade, a bit like the way some ignorant people might talk about Romanians now. It was thought Albert wasn\u2019t grand enough to marry the Queen of England and Wellington asked for reassurances about his Protestantism.\u201d</p> <p>A report in an edition of the Observer from 25 November 1839 supports Goodwin\u2019s portrayal of the sniffy remarks made about his family background: \u201cThe singular fortunes of the family of Saxe Cobourg [sic] are the extraordinary and wonderful incidents of the age. The domain of Cobourg, the patrimonial estate of the present duke, the eldest of the family and brother of Leopold, was a very principality, the net revenue did not exceed \u00a3700 per annum. Of course upon such an income, the family pride was difficult to support, and the means of education for the younger branches extremely restricted.\u201d</p> <p>The article goes on: \u201cNever before, perhaps, in so short a space of time, did a family attain fortunes so magnificent without deeds of arms or special services of any public nature.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f85428454dbbc9135a26d6fb8906ec8536d28f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f85428454dbbc9135a26d6fb8906ec8536d28f6/0_129_2660_3325/800.jpg\" alt=\"A contemporary engraving of the couple.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A contemporary engraving of the couple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rischgitz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <em>Times</em> came to the same conclusion on 11 February 1840: \u201cIt would scarcely be possible to find in history an instance of a princely house increasing its hereditary possessions to such a degree and at the same time extending itself upon three Royal European thrones.\u201d</p> <p>Goodwin explained that worry centred on sexual politics and snobbery, as well as religion: \u201cAlbert was penniless and that certainly worried them. They did not want to give him a proper title, like Duke of Edinburgh, because they did not want him to sit in the house of Lords. He was furious about it because he had a strong inclination towards public service,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Albert\u2019s uncle Leopold I, king of the Belgians, the man who brokered the engagement and is played in the series by Alex Jennings, had been viewed as a fortune hunter when he married Princess Charlotte of Wales in 1816. He was given a state allowance of \u00a350,000 a year that he continued to draw long after Charlotte died in 1817.</p> <p>\u201cThe Coburgs were a little like the Kardashians, or maybe even the Middletons,\u201d said Goodwin. \u201cAnd there was concern that a member of the royal family was marrying into the family once again.\u201d</p> <p>Coleman\u2019s Victoria, who, quite correctly, Goodwin points out, has no German accent as, although her mother was German, she was raised in England, asks why her people hate Germans so much. \u201cMelbourne is said to have told her, \u2018I don\u2019t mind their talents, but I don\u2019t think much of their beauty,\u2019\u201d said Goodwin.</p>",
  "<p>My West Yorkshire working-class background offers a microcosm of the absurdities of the selective schooling debate (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/observer-view-on-grammar-schools\">Selection is bad for children, bad for society</a>\u201d, editorial comment, last week). After passing the 11-plus, my brother went from a suburban primary to a grammar and then on to a distinguished career as a professor of biochemistry. In contrast, I attended an inner-city primary where, from a cohort of 36, only one boy passed the 11-plus. I was the first student from my secondary modern to get to university, though the lack of modern languages at school denied me access to an arts degree; I settling for a science degree, which I struggled to pass.</p> <p>I am proud of my brother but bitter about how a discredited system limited my opportunities. From a career as a comprehensive school teacher, I know that most of my working-class students thrived in that milieu, whereas I had schoolfriends, some brighter than me, who left school at 15 after feeling like failures at 11.<br><strong>Philip Wood </strong><br>Kidlington, Oxon </p> <p>At 11, after missing out on \u201cgrammar school mobility\u201d, I attended Quarles secondary modern on a large housing estate to the east of London. This was an outstanding school, managed by an exceptional headteacher and supported by a committed staff.</p> <p>Classes were streamed, and two of these would go on to take O-levels. Many achieved results better than the local grammar school. I graduated with a degree in economics, then taught for 30 years. If Mrs May intends to promote social mobility, the lesson of my experience is that you do it for all by ensuring that schools are well resourced, led by quality management employing inspiring teachers. You do not do it by waving the \u201cgrammar\u201d magic wand at a small percentage of the school population which has just reached 11.<br><strong>A Guyver</strong><br>Ashcott, Somerset</p> <p>Grammar schools have been a potent engine of social mobility, giving bright children from working-class families the chance of a first-class education and a better start in life, which many comprehensives do not give. These families are mostly Labour supporters. It is secondary moderns that have failed to give less academic children good vocational training for the workplace.<br><strong>RJ Roscoe</strong><br>Carlisle</p> <p>A key feature of debates about selective education is the acceptance that, in their heyday, grammar schools were academically successful, yet contemporary evidence, easily available, strongly suggests otherwise. The Crowther Report in 1959 found that nearly 40% of grammar school children were leaving with three or fewer O-levels; a truly dire outcome for the brightest 25% or so of pupils. I suspect that if Ofsted teams could be transported back to the 1950s and 1960s to inspect grammar schools using today\u2019s criteria, large numbers would be placed in special measures or given notice to improve.<br><strong>Dr Adrian Elliott</strong><br>York<br></p> <p>\u201cSeven Decades of Schooling\u201d (In Focus, last week) starts by claiming that Butler\u2019s 1944 Education Act provided for a tripartite structure of secondary education. Not so. It was left to the coalition\u2019s Ministry of Education to issue a pamphlet, The Nation\u2019s Schools, in May 1945, suggesting a division into grammar, modern and technical schools. Butler\u2019s Labour successor, Ellen Wilkinson, endorsed that proposal in a December 1945 circular that not only advocated tripartism but reasoned that grammar schools should take no more than 25%-30% of 11-plus children, lest standards be diluted.</p> <p>You are not, alas, alone in perpetuating this myth about the 1944 Act.

  "<p>Shortly before the fateful referendum, Lord Carrington, the Tory party\u2019s most distinguished elder statesman, was at a Sunday lunch in the country, listening patiently to the younger element discussing the merits or otherwise of one Alexander (Boris) Johnson. When they eventually paused for breath, the great man spoke, and brought the conversation to a halt with the simple remark: \u201cAnyway, he won\u2019t do.\u201d</p> <p>I recalled this episode last week when Ken Clarke, one of my favourite Tories of the generation after Carrington, and now in turn very much an elder statesman in his own right, was reported as saying something that could be paraphrased as \u201canyway, the referendum won\u2019t do\u201d.</p> <p>What Ken apparently wrote in an email to a constituent was that most politicians \u201cpaid lip-service to the supposedly democratic nature of the [referendum] exercise\u201d, but he would do his best \u201cto contribute to mitigating the disaster that this decision on 23&#xa0;June might otherwise cause\u201d.</p> <p>He said he would probably vote against any move to trigger, via the infamous article 50, the Brexit process, and noted the shambles the government has already got itself into over trying to square the circle of remaining in the single market and customs union while satisfying the anti-immigration lobby.</p> <p>Which brings us to an interesting revelation by Nick Clegg, who has just published his version of the coalition years that wrecked the Lib Dem vote in last year\u2019s general election. Here we are, with the biggest housing crisis since the second world war, and Clegg tells us that either David Cameron or George Osborne (he can\u2019t remember which, but that hardly matters since, to coin a phrase, they were \u201call in it together\u201d) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/nick-clegg-did-not-cater-tories-brazen-ruthlessness\" title=\"\">told him</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing: it just creates Labour voters.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg found Osborne\u2019s behaviour \u201cvery unattractive, very cynical&#xa0;\u2026 Welfare for Osborne was just a bottomless pit of savings, and it didn\u2019t really matter what the human consequences were.\u201d</p> <p>This, from a recent interview in the <em>Guardian</em>, provides chapter and verse for the conclusion that my fellow critics and I came to about Osborne right from the start of his nasty austerity programme. Not only was the attack on the poor disgraceful, and out of keeping with the kind of Conservatism believed in by Tories such as the late Ian Gilmour (who was meant to be one of David Cameron\u2019s heroes), but it must have contributed to the revolt against London and the establishment that was one of the factors behind the Brexit vote.</p> <p>In which context, the Oxford economist Andrew Graham \u2013 son of Winston Graham of <em>Poldark</em> fame \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/17/uk-in-control-post-brexit-fantasy-eu-trade-only-remaining-clout\" title=\"\">wrote in the course of the referendum campaign</a>: \u201cOne of the more unedifying aspects of this campaign is observing Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, both members of a government that has been imposing cuts in public services, having the gall to blame [the pressure on public services] on immigration.\u201d</p> <p>Now, for the moment Theresa May has ruled out not only a second referendum but even a parliamentary vote on article 50. But Tim Farron, the leader of the Lib Dems, made the point last week that, as the public wakes up to the realisation that leaving the EU is a \u201ccalamitous situation that our children will pay for\u201d, the prevailing belief that a second referendum is out of the question may be challenged.</p> <p>I would add to Farron\u2019s observation: yes, \u201cthe people have spoken\u201d, but human nature is fickle, especially when faced with dawning reality, and the people may want to speak again. Indeed some of the people are already upset at reports that they may have to pay for visas to go to the continent.</p> <p>One of the more bizarre aspects of this rotten business is the title that has been bestowed upon my old friend and champion of civil liberties, David Davis. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Pure <em>Yes, Minister.</em> You could not make it up.</p> <p>Many people seem to have forgotten that Davis could well have become leader of the Conservative party until he was upstaged by David Cameron, who is now reduced to saying that at least one promise he kept was the one to hold a referendum \u2013 in truth, the one promise he should never have kept.</p> <p>Davis backed what turned out to be Theresa May\u2019s ultra-short-lived campaign, although he had often disagreed with her in the past. There is a mutual respect there, but it is already being sorely tested by May\u2019s understandable desperation to maintain as many trading advantages as possible, while Davis is quite cavalier about the single market.</p> <p>He believes that the completion of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations in the 1990s was more important for the British economy than joining the single market (which latter move Mrs Thatcher, no less, initiated).</p> <p>One can agree to disagree on this, but what is especially absurd about Brexit is that the kind of regulations and tariff barriers that are in prospect for British business would make current complaints about \u201cBrussels\u201d look like a vicarage tea party.</p> <p>Yes, sorry: I refuse to accept the prevailing view that we must accept the results of the referendum and \u201cmove on\u201d. Bully for Ken Clarke and Tim Farron: I am right with them, and I hope many others will join us.</p>",
  "<p>It was good to see the Scottish government last week finally accede to the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s polite request, expressed once or twice in the past few years, that pupils from our more disadvantaged areas be granted slightly <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14726604.Scottish_universities_consider_national_fair_access_scheme_for_poorest_students/\" title=\"\">easier access to university</a>.</p> <p>The phrase \u201ceasier access\u201d though, misrepresents and distorts the reality of the daily struggles that pupils from a non-privileged background encounter when trying to reach a Scottish university. There is nothing easy about it.</p> <p>Unlike children who were lucky enough to be born to parents who live in houses with conservatories and mono-block driveways, children from Possil and Easterhouse do not get access to private, at-home tuition.</p> <p>These children emerge from communities where the urban apocalypse of premature death, disease, unemployment and violent crime can often choke an academic blossoming before it has begun. Thus the student make-up of our top universities and colleges is largely free from one large sector of Scottish society. They reward privilege and wealth and have failed to bend a little to recognise success in adversity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/10/scottish-universities-sturgeon-glasgow-st-andrews-edinburgh-strathclyde\" title=\"\">The response to the government\u2019s plans to make access to university fairer</a> was trite and predictable. Universities Scotland, the body which represents 19 institutions, said there would be a consequent \u201cdisplacement\u201d if more students from disadvantaged backgrounds were to gain access.</p> <p>Such a response conveniently fails to recognise that this educational \u201cdisplacement\u201d theory has exclusively worked against children from poorer areas since comprehensive education was established.</p> <p>If there is now to be a \u201cdisplacement\u201d of middle-class pupils then so be it. They already have the unfair advantages of private tuition and fee-paying schools that enjoy huge tax breaks. If some of them now have to work a bit harder to get into university then that\u2019s a levelling of the playing field; not a \u201cdisplacement\u201d.</p> <p>The government\u2019s announcement on easier access for poorer students also comes at a time when it seems that Scotland\u2019s system of education is facing its biggest overhaul in 50 years.</p> <p>While all other areas of life in Scotland have been altered, updated or revolutionised to keep pace with technological and cultural changes in society, the way she educates her children has remained motionless in a 1960s time-warp.</p> <p>Teachers are trained in the same way as they always have been; local authorities get to appoint staff and heads, and none of them will ever be disciplined or relieved of their duties through incompetence or rank unsuitability. The Educational Institute of Scotland is permitted to hold entire educational authorities to ransom, and parents are largely cut out of matters pertaining to their children\u2019s education.</p> <p>Despite the needs of schools from different socio-economic regions varying drastically, headteachers have very little autonomy to use their funds in the way they deem to be most appropriate.</p> <p>This antediluvian approach was dismally encapsulated in the words of Jamie Petrie, the head of Broomhouse primary in Edinburgh. \u201cThere are few other jobs where the public can tell folk how to do their jobs, yet in schools we are expected to accept this.\u201d</p> <p>Rarely has such a short statement contained so much that is wrong and so much that is arrogant. Not only ought schools to work in partnership with parents but there simply isn\u2019t any other area in Scottish public life where \u201cthe public\u201d aren\u2019t allowed an opinion.</p> <p>It is this sort of attitude by an out-of-touch teaching establishment in Scotland which has seen education in this country stranded in a state of stasis, captured in a sociological specimen jar to be gawped at by disbelieving future generations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/25/alexsalmond\" title=\"\">John Swinney</a>, the deputy first minister of Scotland and education minister, is the Scottish National Party administration\u2019s go-to politician when an important area of public life requires failing public trust to be restored. He doesn\u2019t easily make enemies. Last Tuesday he unveiled a <a href=\"https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/john-swinney-devolve-education-decisions-school-level\" title=\"\">review of school governance</a>. He has spent the entire summer hinting at its contents and taking informal consultations, so the shift of power and funding from councils to headteachers that it signals did not come as a great surprise.</p> <p>If Swinney can deliver this though \u2013 and there is still much detail to be painted in \u2013 it will constitute the most radical change in the educational delivery model in living memory.</p> <p>Swinney, it seems, wants to devolve much more of the decision-making process to schools. He isn\u2019t cutting out the important role of local authorities in delivering education, simply allowing the professionals to forge a new and much more collaborative partnership with parents.</p> <p>This would build on the relationship that already exists between headteachers and parent councils. Intriguingly, the review of school governance would also provide the means for parents to move against incompetent and arrogant local authorities who are seeking to close successful schools against the wishes of staff and parents.</p> <p>Crucially, it hints at permitting headteachers the autonomy to identify failing teachers and either improve them by performance management or encourage them to find a more suitable, non-teaching role.</p> <p>If the attainment gap that exists between pupils from poorer schools and those from wealthier ones is to be reduced, it won\u2019t happen simply by easier access to university. The changes must start in the primary school and continue seamlessly on to secondary school.</p> <p>The education minister has also moved to slap down any suggestions that, by offering more autonomy to headteachers and giving a greater say to parents, that he is paving the way for the discredited free schools model that exists in England.</p> <p>This is important. There can be no room for classroom teachers who don\u2019t possess the required postgraduate qualifications, and there must be no scope for private individuals to hijack the running of a school according to their own passing whims.</p> <p>There remains a great deal to do to address ingrained habits in Scottish schools and to bring it into the 21st century, but Scotland\u2019s education minister looks like he has grasped the&#xa0;issues.</p> <p>By the time the consultation period for his proposals has ended, his party will have been in charge of education in Scotland for a decade. That\u2019s more than enough time for material and significant change to have occurred.</p>",
  "<p>Tim Boxall points at a shape in the field bordering the seven-acre wooded pen where he keeps 1,500 pheasants. \u201cHere you are,\u201d he says. \u201cLook! There\u2019s one over here.\u201d He bends down and prises the remains of a pheasant from the long grass. \u201cThat\u2019s a buzzard kill, you can tell by the way it\u2019s been eaten.\u201d</p> <p>Boxall is a gamekeeper, raising 10,000 pheasants a year to be killed in commercial shoots on the land he rents in Gloucestershire. This year, however, the pheasants have something other than Boxall\u2019s clients to fear: the buzzard.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying: where there\u2019s livestock, there\u2019s going to be deadstock,\u201d Boxall says. \u201cYou accept the buzzards are always going to have some, but this year was horrendous. I lost 500 pheasants at \u00a33.75 each. It cost me \u00a375 a day to pay someone to sit there all day to watch over them, basically sunbathing for two weeks, but it did keep them away.\u201d</p> <p>The buzzard\u2019s robust health \u2013 and its appetite for pheasants \u2013 has brought the protected bird of prey into the sights of the shooting industry. At the end of July, Natural England, the government agency tasked with protecting England\u2019s wildlife, issued a licence allowing a gamekeeper to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/issue-of-buzzard-licence\" title=\"\">shoot up to 10 buzzards</a> to stop them killing pheasants. Last week it announced that four more licences were under consideration. While the announcement couldn\u2019t come soon enough for Boxall, it has left many conservationists up in arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c2ce041c145ffe77c3423b56626e98415df708a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2ce041c145ffe77c3423b56626e98415df708a1/0_0_3818_3750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gamekeeper Tim Boxall with the remains of a dead pheasant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"982\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gamekeeper Tim Boxall with the remains of a dead pheasant found next to his pen in Gloucestershire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Glaister/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you take a buzzard out, others will move in,\u201d said the broadcaster and naturalist Chris Packham, describing Natural England\u2019s decision as a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. \u201cAll you are doing is making a vacuum. In practical terms it\u2019s doomed to fail. In ethical terms it\u2019s abhorrent. These are native birds being killed to protect a non-native species, it\u2019s Lewis Carroll, it\u2019s insane.

In order to protect a private business concern. To protect a few of the tens of millions of non-native game birds that are released into the countryside each year.\u201d</p> <p>Gamekeepers, however, are having none of it. \u201cThe RSPB line is nonsense,\u201d said a spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.nationalgamekeepers.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Gamekeepers\u2019 Organisation</a>. \u201cIn law it\u2019s quite clear: Natural England cannot grant a licence for any purpose that would adversely affect the sustainable status of the species concerned. There has to be a genuine need and no other satisfactory solution. Natural England cannot refuse a licence if those tests are met.\u201d</p> <p>While campaigners question the morality of the decision, they cannot question its legality. The gamekeepers\u2019 organisation backed a successful judicial review launched by a gamekeeper last year to challenge Natural England\u2019s decision to refuse him a licence to control buzzards. Under the terms of the high court ruling, Natural England must \u201cbalance the protection of wild birds against the requirement to prevent serious damage to livestock\u201d. The court further ruled that, \u201cwhere birds are either in pens or are significantly dependent on people, they are classed as livestock\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6cde85a5428a66ff6cf3792740d271778549a3a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cde85a5428a66ff6cf3792740d271778549a3a5/0_913_4912_6140/800.jpg\" alt=\"Broadcaster Chris Packham\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broadcaster Chris Packham has described the buzzard hunting licence as a catastrophe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The buzzard, a protected bird of prey, has recovered from near extinction in the Victorian age to become one of the conservation movement\u2019s success stories. With between 57,000 and 79,000 breeding pairs in the UK, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bto.org/\" title=\"\">British Trust for Ornithology</a>, it is one of the fastest growing bird populations in the country. In support of its decision, Natural England noted that in July the trust declared that buzzards \u201care not considered to be of current conservation concern\u201d.</p> <p>An estimated 40 million non-native pheasants are released into the British countryside each year. A report for the <a href=\"https://basc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Association for Shooting and Conservation</a> estimated that on average between 1% and 2% of pheasant poults were killed by birds of prey.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of hyperbole and panic about this,\u201d said the gamekeepers\u2019 organisation spokesman. \u201cAll birds are protected by law. Buzzards are no different. The only difference is one of perception, that for years it\u2019s been believed that in some ways buzzards are different, that they have a separate protection. You can\u2019t go on saying that there was once a time when this [species] was scarce and using it as a reason to prevent licences.\u201d</p> <p>However, campaigners say that the legal shooting of buzzards will make it more difficult to police the illegal shooting of birds of prey. Calling the move shameful, Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.league.org.uk/\" title=\"\">League Against Cruel Sports</a>, said: \u201cAuthorising this protected raptor to be killed purely to boost the profits of private shooting interests sets a very dangerous precedent. It\u2019s difficult to see how the police can effectively tackle the illegal persecution of these birds of prey now the floodgate of government-approved exceptions to the law has opened.\u201d</p> <p>Boxall remembers when buzzards were rare. \u201cWhen I came here in 1990 you never saw buzzards,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you did you thought, bloody hell, what\u2019s that? They used to feed on carcasses, but they can\u2019t do that now because farmers aren\u2019t allowed to leave carcasses, so they turn to the next easiest thing. The next thing we\u2019ll get is red kites. They\u2019re lovely birds, but they have to eat.\u201d</p> <p>The gamekeeper pauses and cocks an ear. \u201cThat\u2019s a buzzard calling now. He\u2019s up in a tree there somewhere. It must be teatime.\u201d</p> <h2>WING AND A PRAYER</h2> <p>\u25a0 MPs are to debate banning driven-grouse shooting, after a petition launched by Mark Avery, a former RSPB conservation director, gained more than 120,000 signatures.</p> <p>\u25a0 The Hen Harrier Action Plan, a government-led initiative involving conservation groups, landowners and shooting organisations, collapsed in July following incidents of shooting and poisoning.

  "<p>One of Britain\u2019s most prestigious law firms has banned the use of \u201cDear sirs\u201d from all of its legal documents and communications, apparently the first of the \u201cmagic circle\u201d of top City legal companies to do so.</p> <p>Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer has stopped using the phrase from this weekend. In the UK the firm will now address all communications to \u201cDear Sir or Madam\u201d, while in the US all correspondence will start with \u201cDear Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d. Equivalents in Cantonese, Mandarin and European languages have also been agreed across Freshfields\u2019 global network.</p> <p>The firm implemented the change after one of its London associates researched legal documents from the last 10 initial public offerings of private company shares. It found 81 law firms and banks exclusively used \u201cDear Sirs\u201d on letters and communications during the process. Freshfields\u2019 joint managing partner Chris Pugh said: \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively small change, but it\u2019s a significant point and you notice that when everyone immediately accepts that the change needs to happen.\u201d\u201cI hope it will shed light on other things that we might inadvertently be doing that risk alienating people we communicate with - not only people at Freshfields but clients and other professionals as well.\u201d</p> <p>Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, the UK\u2019s largest charity for women\u2019s rights, said the change was long overdue. \u201cIt\u2019s to be welcomed, but it is pretty basic stuff which we should all be doing really. I still get referred to as \u2018Mr Sam Smethers\u2019 by the media, despite being the chief executive of a women\u2019s charity. We have to think about the language we use as it reveals the assumptions and decisions being made. Even parliament continues to use \u2018he\u2019 in legislation, the assumption being that that will refer to everyone. We should be looking at gender neutral language for our legislation too.\u201d</p> <p>Law firm Withers said the male address was \u201caccepted standard\u201d. A spokesman said: \u201cIt very much depends on who we\u2019re writing to. If they are an individual then it depends on their gender and title. If it\u2019s an organisation, then we currently use \u2018Dear Sirs\u2019 as that remains the accepted standard.

  "<p>Two of the highest-level global summits ever convened on refugees and mass migration take place in New York this week: one by the United Nations and the other by the White House. This should be the reform moment when the world comes together to update a broken system that is struggling to meet contemporary displacement challenges. But a combination of inter-agency turf wars and government foot-dragging make this unlikely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/world-will-not-face-up-to-refugee-crisis-un-obama\">Why won\u2019t the world tackle the refugee crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tomorrow\u2019s UN meeting will focus more on abstract principles of commitment than concrete practice. A conference originally conceived with the intention of addressing the situation of Syrian refugees and the Mediterranean morphed into a negotiation of two \u201cGlobal Compacts\u201d: one on refugees and one on migration. But even these have collapsed in negotiations, such that the final declaration now reveals only vague principles, denuded of substance by spoiler governments.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s Obama-led Leaders\u2019 Summit is about pledging. Unable to elicit additional resettlement places from Congress, the administration has focused on playing an international convening goal. It has sought commitments in three areas: additional humanitarian assistance, more resettlement places, and a focus on jobs and education. But with states experiencing donor fatigue, significant new pledges seem improbable.</p> <p>The tragedy is that these meetings have become irresponsibly removed from the real challenges on the ground. They will do little to directly address systematic non-compliance with refugee law in Europe or Australia, to ensure that refugees stuck in camps are not indefinitely trapped in limbo, to address the plight of millions of urban refugees, or to define a response to the millions of people who will be displaced by factors such as climate change that fall outside the existing refugee framework.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Today people are mainly fleeing fragile states characterised by mass violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The summits have largely bypassed the biggest and most urgent questions relating to institutional reform. There is widespread acknowledgement that the system is broken and yet no appetite to fix it. In 1971 the international monetary system reached its crisis moment and reformed; 2016 should be that moment for refugees. Change is needed because the refugee system was created in the early cold war largely to meet US interests in avoiding the return of displaced Germans to the communist bloc. And yet, in a radically changed world, this time-warped framework is still expected to apply.</p> <p>The basic idea in the 1951 Refugee Convention \u2013 that refugees should not be returned to serious harm \u2013 remains as relevant today as ever. However, its focus on refugees as people fleeing \u201cpersecution\u201d has become antiquated. Today people are mainly fleeing fragile states characterised by mass violence. While courts have sometimes managed to shoehorn contemporary displacement into outdated language, the result is arbitrary exclusions and erratic responses: in 2014 recognition rates for Eritrean asylum seekers ranged from 26% in France to 100% in Sweden. Meanwhile for many years Germany would not recognise Somali refugees because the harm they experienced was from non-state actors rather than a persecuting government.</p> <p>Organisational reform is also off the table. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) does what it does very well: humanitarian aid and camp management, and legal advice to states. But these are no longer the primary things a UN refugee agency needs to be doing. The tools needed today are political engagement, development and economics, and the ability to work in urban environments. The disjuncture is exemplified by the stark reality that the overwhelming majority of Syrian refugees receive no assistance whatsoever from UNHCR or its partners. A UN refugee agency remains indispensable but donor states should be asking for an updated model.</p> <p>On the ground, the default model is one of humanitarian assistance in camps. But too many refugees in camps get stuck there for decades, where they usually have no right to work. 56% of the world\u2019s refugees are in protracted situations, having been in exile for at least 5 years. Refuge needs to be reconceived as at least as much about development as about humanitarianism. It needs to offer jobs and education to the nearly 90% of the world\u2019s refugees who are in developing countries, including the majority who are now in cities.</p> <p>Tragically, a vision for legal, organisational and operational reform will not feature on the agenda this week. Addressing these issues is the key to finding sustainable solutions not only to the Syrian crisis but also inevitable future movements.</p> <p>But there may still be hope. In order to save face, the UN conveners will now use 19 September to launch an ongoing two-year intergovernmental process. At the margins of the formal meetings, governments, businesses and civil society have mobilised to launch a range of exciting initiatives. These pathways may still leave the door ajar for meaningful change.</p> <p><em>Alexander Betts is director of the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford.

It had decided that this was no longer necessary, and the property was not suitable for a domestic let.</p> <p>The problem, according to another Cotehele tenant, Kate Maciver-Redwood, is that the National Trust has failed to maintain its properties properly, which causes ill-feeling among the tenants. Her family runs Haye Farm, and she says it has taken three years for the local surveyor, who is responsible for maintaining the rented cottages, to arrange repairs. The Maciver-Redwoods have to pay half the cost, but have no control over the work.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been seven-and-a-half years since the windows were painted and if they\u2019d been properly maintained they wouldn\u2019t need to be replaced,\u201d she said. \u201cNow they\u2019re almost falling out.\u201d</p> <p>She said they had spent \u201ctens of thousands of pounds\u201d installing a new kitchen and repairing the floor after regular flooding. When they first moved into Haye Farm, the farmhouse was full of chickens because the door had been left open.\u201cThey put our rent up 30% two years ago. I said \u2018If this helps you crack on, then we\u2019ll go ahead with it.\u2019 How stupid and naive were we?\u201d</p> <p>Tenants in Cornwall are not the only ones who are unhappy. Last year, the villagers of Low Newton-by-the-Sea in Northumberland complained when the National Trust refused to re-let a seaside cottage when it became vacant and instead turned it into a holiday let.</p> <p>The village of Blickling in Norfolk has five holiday lets out of 17 National Trust properties. The population declined from 136 to 113 between 2001 and 2011, according to the latest census.</p> <p>According to the charity\u2019s housing policy, its aims include helping to meet \u201cidentified social housing needs where we are a significant housing provider\u201d, and it also talks of selecting tenants with skills to help with its work and favouring people who make a contribution to the community.</p> <p>Yet that policy does not seem to be being followed, said Robin Kisby: \u201cIt talks about \u2018tenant custodians\u2019, but really it seems to be about making money.\u201d</p> <p>The National Trust made \u00a344m from tenants last year, a rise of 39% since the 2008 global financial crisis, while wages have remained broadly static. It makes another \u00a310m from holiday cottages, and has added about 100 to its portfolio in the past 10 years. In 2006, it was advertising its \u201cunique collection of over 320 properties\u201d; now it is offering 418.</p> <p>A National Trust spokeswoman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a policy of turning domestic rentals into holiday cottages. The number of holiday cottages has increased very modestly over recent years, by around five a year. That\u2019s a rise of 0.3% as a proportion of our overall rented housing stock.\u201d</p> <p>And holiday cottages were not always created from tenanted properties \u2013 sometimes they came from other farm buildings or operational buildings that were not residential. She said that two holiday lets in Yorkshire had recently been transformed into permanent rentals, and that in 2015, 64% of tenants who responded were \u201csatisfied with us as landlords\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe take our responsibilities for houses we rent out very seriously, which is why we are spending more than \u00a325m this year on annual maintenance and refurbishment. We\u2019ve never invested more than we do now.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>She has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in both the country of her detention and that of her birth. Condemned to death on drug-smuggling charges, she was temporarily reprieved hours before her execution, but still languishes on death row in an Indonesian prison. And last week the skies darkened again over Mary Jane Veloso, a Filipino maid whose plight has captured the imagination of two populations that know all about the vulnerability of migrant workers.</p> <p>After the Philippines\u2019 president, the newly installed Rodrigo Duterte, visited Jakarta, <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/09/12/duterte-has-given-the-green-light-for-mary-janes-execution-jokowi.html\">it was reported</a> that he had given his Indonesian counterpart, Joko Widodo, the go-ahead to execute her. Duterte has begun a ferocious and bloody war on drugs in the Philippines. That change of political direction has, it seems, led to yet another twist in the tortured tale of a woman who lost control of her life from the moment she entered Indonesia in 2010, hoping, she has said, to take up a job in domestic service.</p> <p>Amid public outrage in the Philippines, Widodo subsequently clarified that Duterte had said: \u201cPlease, go ahead with the process in line with the law in Indonesia,\u201d without naming Veloso. Few of her supporters were reassured. \u201cWe demand an immediate explanation from President Duterte \u2026 duty-bound to defend the rights of Filipinos overseas, especially drug-trafficking victims like Mary Jane,\u201d said <a href=\"https://migranteinternational.org/\">Migrante International</a>, a group that campaigns for the Veloso family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0090873d752a1b94c0a6ec792905fcf76cf711e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0090873d752a1b94c0a6ec792905fcf76cf711e8/0_35_4316_2589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cesar and Celia Veloso, Mary Jane\u2019s parents, at a rally in Manila before President Duterte\u2019s visit to Indonesia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cesar and Celia Veloso, Mary Jane\u2019s parents, at a rally in Manila before President Duterte\u2019s visit to Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romeo Ranoco / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born to an impoverished family in the northern city of Cabanatuan, Veloso married at 17 but later separated from her husband. She moved to the United Arab Emirates in 2009 to earn money for her two young sons in the Philippines.</p> <p>Veloso says that she had to flee Dubai after an attempted rape and was then duped into smuggling drugs into Indonesia. Her case has become the focus of sympathy in both the Philippines and Indonesia, where many families have loved ones working abroad, often in poor conditions with abusive employers. Before the original date set for her execution last April, more than 200,000 signatures from 127 countries were collected for a <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/91333-save-mary-jane-top-10-signed-change-org-petitions\">#SaveMaryJane petition.</a></p> <p>Veloso says that a woman called Maria Kristina Sergio, the daughter of one of her godparents, told her to move to Indonesia for a maid\u2019s job in 2010. In an account that Sergio disputes, Veloso says the woman gave her new clothes and a bag that she says she was unaware had 2.6kg (5.7lb) of heroin sewn into it. \u201cWe\u2019re poor and I wanted to change our life, but I could never commit the crime they have accused me of,\u201d Veloso wrote last year in a letter to the then president, Benigno Aquino.</p> <p>Her legal team launched two appeals in Indonesia, one that argued she did not have a competent translator, and a second saying she was scammed. Both were rejected.</p> <p>As her April 2015 execution date approached, protesters in the Philippines and Indonesia rallied to save her and hundreds of people held vigils outside the Indonesian embassy in Manila. Even world boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao made a public plea for her life.</p> <p>Two days before Veloso\u2019s execution date, her family was allowed a visit. She explained to her sons that she would not be coming home. Her youngest child, six-year-old Mark Darren, said he would try to think that \u201cMama is in heaven\u201d.</p> <p>Then Indonesia shot dead eight people, including two Australians, part of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling ring, four Nigerians, a Brazilian and an Indonesian. But not Veloso, although several newspapers in the Philippines reported she was dead. The hashtag \u201cmaryjanelives\u201d trended on Twitter across the Philippines and Indonesia.</p> <p>The reprieve was down to an unexpected turn of events in her homeland. Veloso\u2019s alleged trafficker, Sergio, had handed herself in to police hours before the execution. And Aquino, invoking a regional treaty that compels nations to co-operate on transnational crime, asked Indonesia to keep Veloso alive. He said she was needed to testify in the case against Sergio and another man, now accused of trafficking, illegal recruitment and fraud.</p> <p>Indonesia\u2019s president insisted that the execution was merely postponed, but the campaign for clemency had new grounds for hope.</p> <p>A year on, the accession of Duterte to the presidency has again changed the dynamics of Veloso\u2019s case. Duterte\u2019s first three months in office have been dominated by a bloody crackdown that has left 3,526 alleged drug dealers and addicts dead, most of them in extrajudicial killings by vigilante groups, actions that were publicly encouraged by Duterte before he was elected.</p> <p>Senator Leila de Lima, who has been leading a senate hearing into the killings and is one of the main domestic critics of Duterte, said that she was \u201csad and heartbroken that the president will throw away all our efforts to save a life just like that, when it is still in his power to request the holding off of the execution\u201d. But it was no surprise, she added, that Veloso\u2019s life might seem of no worth to an administration that had adopted judicial or extrajudicial executions as \u201cgovernment policy\u201d.</p> <p>Even Duterte has said that fighting for Veloso\u2019s life would sit badly with his drugs crackdown. \u201cIt would have left a bad taste in the mouth to be talking about having a strong posture against drugs and here you are begging for something,\u201d he told reporters, adding that he told Widodo he supported the death penalty in Indonesia. Capital punishment was outlawed in the Philippines in 2006.</p> <p>Veloso\u2019s legal team told the <em>Observer</em> it was very concerned. \u201cMary Jane is a victim of dire poverty, of lack of real opportunities for a decent job, of pernicious drug and human trafficking. The law may be the law, but it should not be blind or deaf to reality,\u201d lawyer Edre Olalia wrote in an email. \u201cAs the leader of this nation and as the <em>pater familias</em> of all Filipinos, President Duterte is expected to rise to his bounden duty and fight for her, and fight hard as he does for all victims of this transnational infection.\u201d</p> <p>Widodo\u2019s reported conversation with Duterte has reinvigorated public interest in Veloso\u2019s case and the office of Indonesia\u2019s attorney general said last week that she would not be killed in the next wave of executions. The judge in the case involving Sergio said that she would fly to Indonesia this month to get a deposition from Veloso in her prison cell. Veloso\u2019s supporters believe that a trial can vindicate her, if it can prove she was used as a pawn.</p> <p>\u201cWinning the case will codify Mary Jane\u2019s innocence and erase all doubts that she should be spared from execution,\u201d said Garry Martinez, chair of Migrante International.</p> <p>Ruperto Santos, a prominent Roman Catholic bishop in the Philippines, said that \u201cconflicting reports regarding the actions of President Duterte\u201d on the Veloso case were regrettable. \u201cLet us continue to pray for her, that her life be spared.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2016 to clarify that people killed in the crackdown are alleged, not necessarily proven, to be drug dealers and drug addicts. <br></p>",
  "<p>For all its clarity, novelty and wit, there was perhaps something foolhardy in Podemos\u2019s decision to model its last election manifesto on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/podemos-manifesto-ikea-catalogue-flat-pack-policies\">Ikea catalogue</a>.</p> <p>The symbolism was not hard to fathom: here, cooed the pages showing candidates at home, was a bright, straightforward, modern party; an explosion of youthful colour along the musty, dark-wood corridors of traditional Spanish politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/spain-mariano-rajoy-third-general-election-christmas-day\">Spain braces itself for unwanted gift on Christmas Day: a third election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the eve of the election in June \u2013 Spain\u2019s second in six months \u2013 Podemos had every reason to cheerful. Bolstered by the decision to run on a joint ticket with United Left (IU), a leftwing coalition that includes the Communist party of Spain, things were looking overwhelmingly positive. Experts and polls alike predicted that the new alliance, Unidos Podemos, would consolidate the phenomenal gains made by the grassroots social movement in the December vote and achieve its dream of replacing the Spanish Socialist party (PSOE) as the pre-eminent voice of the left.</p> <p>Until the first exit polls came in on the evening of Sunday 26 June, the <em>sorpasso</em> (overtaking) was taken for granted. A few hours later, though, it seemed that in true flatpack fashion someone had mislaid the instructions, snapped the dowels and lost a few vital screws. Unidos Podemos failed to make gains and lost more than a million votes. No party achieved a majority and Spain, not for the first time, found itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/spanish-elections-exit-polls-show-deadlock-likely-to-continue\">without a government</a>.</p> <p>Since then, the question for Podemos supporters has been simple: why had the blisteringly successful force that erupted from popular discontent over austerity and corruption to threaten four decades of two-party rule suddenly fallen short? A few obvious answers suggested themselves. Perhaps the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, three days before, had sent voters scurrying back into the familiar arms of the PSOE and the conservative People\u2019s party (PP); perhaps the attempts by the Podemos party leader, Pablo Iglesias, to reach out to the centre ground by diluting the revolutionary rhetoric had confused and alienated people.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, the party\u2019s poor performance led to weeks of introspection that have further revealed the ideological tensions at its core. Most visible has been the rivalry between Iglesias and Podemos\u2019s policy chief and number two, I\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n. If Errej\u00f3n has pushed for a more pragmatic approach to the PSOE, with a view to sharing power after December\u2019s election, then Iglesias has gone out of his way to antagonise the Socialists, once memorably reminding parliament of the anti-Eta death squads that operated under the government of former PSOE leader Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez.</p> <p>Now the growing tensions are coming to a head in Madrid, where competing factions are vying for control of Podemos\u2019s birthplace and its future. On one side is Tania S\u00e1nchez, a former IU MP, who, along with Madrid councillor Rita Maestre, hopes to make the local party a more \u201cfriendly, female and decentralised\u201d outfit.</p> <p>Opposite them are the Iglesias loyalists, such as the party\u2019s general secretary in the capital, Luis Alegre, who has long had a troubled relationship with the Errej\u00f3nista faction.</p> <p>To complicate things further, S\u00e1nchez, who is standing to be the party\u2019s new leader in Madrid, is a former girlfriend of Iglesias, while Maestre used to go out with Errej\u00f3n. In an attempt to head off the inevitable innuendo, both women put out a statement: \u201cWe are not girlfriends or ex-girlfriends, we are human beings who make our own decisions. We don\u2019t need a man to help us or lead us \u2026 We\u2019re protagonists who defend a Podemos for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Iglesias responded coolly, saying he was convinced there would be \u201cfar better candidates\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53a5196b496b71caf62b153829cd0f59a6e020fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53a5196b496b71caf62b153829cd0f59a6e020fa/281_0_3038_3798/800.jpg\" alt=\"Madrid councillor Rita Maestre\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Councillor Rita Maestre speaks at a political event in Madrid last June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Parra/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no division between Iglesias and Errej\u00f3n when it comes to objectives, but there is one when it comes to means and strategies,\u201d says the sociologist and commentator Jorge Galindo.</p> <p>\u201cIglesias has forged an alliance with the anti-capitalist movements because he thinks about a strategy involving a Leninist assault by the proletarian vanguard.</p> <p>Errej\u00f3n, on the other hand, who\u2019s more of a populist in the Latin American sense \u2013 Ecuador, Bolivia \u2013 has a much closer alliance with the policy-oriented group: first you deliver and do things for the people, then you create dominance.\u201d</p> <p>Though it may object to the religious image, Podemos is indeed a broad church or, as Galindo puts it, \u201ca half-formed political animal, a coalition of pretty varied interests that\u2019s kept together by electoral success and by the drive to occupy new space\u201d.</p> <p>Antonio Barroso, an analyst at the political risk advisory firm Teneo Intelligence, sees the internal divisions as a sign that the party is coming of age politically. \u201cIt was like a virgin party when it emerged, formed of <em>c\u00edrculos</em> [working groups] to represent the people. At the end of the day it\u2019s just becoming a classic party with its internal quarrels.\u201d</p> <p>In one way, says Barroso, Podemos is now little different to the PSOE. The Socialist leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is facing growing calls from within the party to reverse his long-held refusal to end Spain\u2019s nine-month political impasse by allowing the country\u2019s acting prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, to form a minority government led by his People\u2019s party.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Podemos has shaken up the debate and shaken up parliament.

As well as benefiting from a more hierarchical structure, the PP was also the only party to increase its seat count in June, taking 14 more seats than in December and finishing first, albeit well short of an absolute majority.</p> <p>With third elections now looming in December, the pressure is on the other parties to rescue Spain from an unwelcome Christmas present. With the PP holding firm and the Socialists starting to squirm, it is up to Podemos to show that it can regain the unity and momentum that it lost on 26 June.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t live up to expectations, and that\u2019s true. But to go from zero to 69 seats in one election is insane by Spanish standards,\u201d says Barroso. \u201cThey have shaken up the debate and they have shaken up parliament. The question now is: where does it go from here? Does it become another party in parliament that will continue growing or does it become a marginal force?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Everton have not always responded well to adversity in the past but there is steel running through the side under Ronald Koeman. They went behind to the most dubious of away goals midway through the first half but simply brushed the injustice aside, recovered within minutes and went on to claim a handsome victory. Everton now sit second in the table and have scored six goals in their last two games, though it must be said Middlesbrough, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/12/sunderland-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sunderland earlier in the week</a>, do not possess the most resolute of defences.</p> <p>\u201cOur start was not good,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cWe needed to be more aggressive with the pressing but we got there in the end and played some great football. We have improved a lot physically and we have brought in players with a lot of&#xa0;energy.\u201d</p> <p>Gareth Barry enjoyed an eventful evening as he made his 600th Premier League appearance, only the third player to record such a milestone after Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard. The Everton vice-captain could have gifted Middlesbrough an opening goal when he lost the ball in front of his own penalty area, and was relieved when Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez proved to be less sharp at shooting than dispossessing opponents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/manchester-city-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City and Kevin De Bruyne roll on with Bournemouth thumping</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Six minutes later the visitors did take an unexpected lead, and Barry led the posse of Everton players moaning about it. In fairness he probably had a point, \u00c1lvaro Negredo\u2019s goal should not have stood. Replays showed the Boro striker headed Maarten Stekelenburg\u2019s arm rather than the ball as the pair tried to claim George Friend\u2019s cross from the left touchline, thus preventing the goalkeeper making a clean catch. Lee Mason did not have the benefit of replays, however, and awarded the goal, presumably on the grounds that Negredo only attacked the ball and did not appear to have committed any obvious foul.</p> <p>One imagines Barry was making the point a little too forcibly that in such situations goalkeepers are normally given the benefit of the doubt. In a way it was refreshing to find a referee unwilling to treat goalkeepers as a protected species, and possibly true that Negredo also deserved the benefit of the doubt, though had the referee had the opportunity to watch a replay he would have been forced to change his mind.</p> <p>If the occasion was turning a little sour Barry lost no time in making amends. A mere three minutes after going behind Everton were level, and it was Barry at the far post who provided the equaliser. V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s punched ineffectively at a Kevin Mirallas corner, succeeding only in pushing the ball against Negredo, from whom it fell to Barry to tuck away with a neat finish, though once again there was an element of controversy. Vald\u00e9s might have dealt with the cross better had not Ashley Williams impeded the goalkeeper by going for the ball with a raised boot.</p> <p>Ross Barkley and Yannick Bolasie both went close for the home side once the scores were level before Everton hit two goals in quick succession to turn round 3-1 in front, a half-time scoreline that little in the previous 45 minutes had suggested. S\u00e9amus Coleman scored the first, accepting a short pass from Romelu Lukaku and coolly rounding Daniel Ayala in the Boro area to make his shooting angle easier, then in the final second of added time Lukaku himself added another. At least the striker claimed the goal, in reality it appeared he had merely stretched out a leg to Bolasie\u2019s cross and made negligible contact. Bolasie had just as strong a claim to the goal, though Lukaku could claim with some justification that it was his action that had diverted the attention of the goalkeeper. Barry\u2019s day become even more eventful with a booking at the end of the first half, after an altercation with Ram\u00edrez.</p> <p>Boro became the second north-east team in a week to be floored by Everton\u2019s ability to score bursts of goals, and the second half was basically a story of a team full of confidence passing the ball at will around a defence more interested in damage limitation. Barkley was conspicuous in most home attacks after his dressing down at Sunderland, clearly focused on correcting the impression that he gives the ball away too cheaply.</p> <p>There were occasions, in fact, when Barkley might have done better to release the ball a little earlier, though one determined run into the box after an hour brought a good save from Vald\u00e9s at the foot of his left hand post.</p> <p>\u201cToday was the Ross Barkley we like to see,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a young player any more, he needs to take responsibility. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/ross-barkley-must-raise-game-everton-ronald-koeman\" title=\"\">I was honest in what I said about him</a>, but players are not stupid, they know when they have not played well.\u201d</p> <p>Barkley would have liked a goal to mark his rehabilitation, yet though always in control, Everton seemed to lose their attacking focus once Lukaku was withdrawn. Enner Valencia made his debut, without managing to decorate it with any contribution of note.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost our concentration at the end of the first half but apart from that Everton had to play well to beat us,\u201d Aitor Karanka said. \u201cThey are a good side, better than us. I think many teams night have lost that game by five or six goals to one.\u201d</p>",

By her own admission, she only took up the sport on a casual basis after having a go at it at a junior camp in 2012. She was only 12. Stretton could not have imagined what she would be doing four years later. After all, not many teenagers celebrate completing their GCSEs by winning Paralympic gold in Rio.</p> <p>Stretton, who uses a wheelchair after being born with cerebral palsy, began the morning by beating another team-mate, Vicky Jenkins, in the semi-final to set up the gold medal match.</p> <p>While Jenkins was disappointed at being denied a place in the final, she played her part in a productive outing for ParalympicsGB\u2019s archers. When she hit the target with her final arrow in her bronze match against South Korean\u2019s Kim Ok-Geum, the 39-year-old\u2019s 125-124 win sealed Britain\u2019s first clean sweep of medals in any sport since they dominated the B7/8 lawn bowls in 1996.</p> <p>Frith, who won silver in the W1 individual event and gold in the team event in last year\u2019s world championships, was no pushover. She was making her Paralympic debut as well. Previously involved in swimming, Frith was bitten by the archery bug when she saw a training session at her local club after a swim in the pool.</p> <p>She quickly demonstrated a knack for it and won individual and mixed team titles at the European Championships earlier this year. Frith, who has multiple sclerosis, could be justifiably confident of ruining Stretton\u2019s big day. Instead, however, it was the youngster who gained revenge for her defeat to Frith in the final of the European Championships, showing nervelessness beyond her years to win 137-124. The healthy margin of victory was proof of Stretton\u2019s class and the fear for her rivals is that she will continue to improve.</p> <p>In the Olympic Stadium, meanwhile, another 16-year-old claimed her third medal in Rio. Maria Lyle won bronze in the T35 200m, having already taken silver and bronze in the 4x100m relay and 100m respectively.</p> <p>China\u2019s Zhou Xia set a world record of 28.22sec on her way to winning her second gold to add to the 100m title, while Australia\u2019s Isis Holt took silver in 28.79. Lyle, a five-times European champion, finished in 29.35.</p> <p>\u201cI liked doing the lap of honour because I didn\u2019t do it in the 100m,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cIt was a season\u2019s best, which I am chuffed about. It\u2019s brilliant to have won three medals at my first Paralympic Games. I couldn\u2019t compete with the Chinese girl so I just needed to do my best.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>While other party leaders might mark the end of their tenure with a stiff drink or a short break, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\">Nigel Farage</a> celebrated his final conference as Ukip leader by taking a late-night skinny-dip during a thunderstorm. </p> <p>Arron Banks, the founder of Leave.EU and a friend of Farage, said they both went for a naked swim in the sea off Bournemouth after a drinking session on the eve of the conference. Farage\u2019s press advisor Andy Wigmore also joined them.</p> <p>The millionaire businessman told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Any Questions on Friday night that Farage would not make another comeback as Ukip leader, after he famously resigned and then changed his mind following the general election in 2015. </p> <p>\u201cI can tell you he\u2019s not coming back,\u201d Banks said. \u201cI can tell you he\u2019s demob-happy because we had dinner last night and we had a few drinks and it was late at night and we went skinny-dipping off Bournemouth pier. So, if ever a man was out to leave British politics, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>Fellow guest Angela Eagle, Labour\u2019s former shadow business secretary, appeared taken aback. \u201cEww, what a terrible image,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there should be a law against it.\u201d</p> <p>The show\u2019s presenter, Jonathan Dimbleby, also appeared surprised by the revelation. He said: \u201cCan we just record for posterity that you, Arron Banks, and Nigel Farage last night went skinny-dipping off Bournemouth pier. Is that what you said?\u201d <br></p> <p>Banks replied: \u201cWell, Nigel actually said to me, \u2018Let\u2019s go for a paddle\u2019. I said, \u2018Come on, man up, let\u2019s just go for a swim. Strip down\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Farage has said it \u201cwasn\u2019t skinny-dipping\u201d because he still had his underpants on. It had seemed an \u201camazingly good idea\u201d to go for the midnight splash, he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was absolutely wonderful. I\u2019m not saying we should recommend people chuck themselves into the sea all around the place, but I can assure you it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve done such a thing and I intend to do it again.\u201d</p> <p>Wigmore also spoke about the incident and said the trio sat and drank whisky after their dip. He told the Mirror: \u201cWe thought he should do a Reggie Perrin and disappear off with only a pile of clothes on the beach and take a picture because we were obviously slightly merry.</p> <p>\u201cWe ended up piling in, clothes piled on to the beach, into the water which was bloody freezing. Then the lightning started and the rain started. We couldn\u2019t get out because it\u2019s much safer in the water. So we swam up and down the beach for half an hour in a thunderstorm. It was great fun.\u201d</p> <p>Viewers were aghast after hearing about his skinny-dipping antics, with some taking to Twitter to chide the BBC for putting the image in their heads:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MaimunaB/status/776871705239314436\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m suing the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC\">@BBC</a> for the emotional trauma of hearing about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage\">@Nigel_Farage</a> going skinny dipping <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCAnyQuestions\">@BBCAnyQuestions</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcaq?src=hash\">#bbcaq</a></p>&mdash; Maimuna Bappa (@MaimunaB) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaimunaB/status/776871705239314436\">September 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/katierosemary12/status/777034528158343169\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Why is there a whole item on this?!? \ud83d\ude27</p>&mdash; Katie Faulkner (@katierosemary12) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katierosemary12/status/777034528158343169\">September 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/_hanimustafa/status/776860278789111808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thank you to the BBC for putting the ghastly image Arron Banks and Nigel Fargae skinny dipping at the Bournemouth seaside \ud83d\ude2e <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcaq?src=hash\">#bbcaq</a></p>&mdash; Hani Mustafa (@_hanimustafa) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_hanimustafa/status/776860278789111808\">September 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Farage has long claimed to be a man of the people and has often been seen holding press conferences in pubs with a pint in his hand.

  "<p>A terminally ill child has become the first minor to be helped to die since Belgium voted to allow <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/13/belgium-law-extends-euthanasia-children-all-ages\">voluntary euthanasia for children</a> in 2014. </p> <p>The head of Belgium\u2019s federal euthanasia commission, Wim Distelmans, gave no details other than to say it was an exceptional case of a child with a terminal illness that a local doctor had reported last week. </p> <p>\u201cFortunately there are very few children who are considered, but that does not mean we should refuse them the right to a dignified death,\u201d Distelmans told a Belgian newspaper.</p> <p>Belgium legalised euthanasia in 2002 and two years ago amended the rules to become the first country in the world to permit doctors to help terminally ill minors of any age to die. Children of any age are allowed to choose to end their suffering, as long as they are able to make rational decisions and are in the final stages of an incurable disease.</p> <p>The amendment, which was passed after much debate \u2013 notably over the meaning of a required \u201ccapacity of discernment\u201d \u2013 offers the possibility of euthanasia to children \u201cin a hopeless medical situation of constant and unbearable suffering that cannot be eased and which will cause death in the short term\u201d.</p> <p>Any request for euthanasia must be made by the minor, be studied by a team of doctors and an independent psychiatrist or psychologist, and have parental consent. In the Netherlands the practice is allowed for children aged at least 12.</p> <p>Between 2003 and 2013, the number of patients being euthanised in Belgium rose nearly eight-fold to 8,752 , according to the national euthanasia control committee\u2019s records.</p>",

You see what happens, Alaves, when you beat Barcelona in the Nou Camp? Somebody else pays for it, that\u2019s what happens.

But this is different; this is almost certain death by MSN.

The Swans did it with 20 after losing McVeigh to a calf injury and Rohan a knee ailment that looked pretty nasty. </p> <p>That opened the door to Adelaide, who worked their way back into this contest in the third quarter, with four goals to two. But Sydney shut down any hope swiftly in the final term.</p> <p>Adelaide will lament how long it took to get into the game, all-too-regular skill errors taken advantage of by the hosts in the early stages. </p> <p>As the game went on, it was the big names: Kennedy (42 touches), Haneberry (31), Heeney (32), Franklin (four goals) - all outstanding. Then the work of the small forwards Papley (four goals) and McGlynn (three). All told, they overwhelmed the visitors. <br></p> <p>So after threatening for so long this season, Adelaide\u2019s campaign is over at least a week earlier than what they would have considered satisfactory.

One in a row, if you don\u2019t mind!</p> <p>Yes, last week the Wallabies broke a six-game losing streak to beat the Springboks in Brisbane, and you could feel the Wallabies\u2019 exhalation of relief on your skin like a sea breeze on a sweltering day.</p> <p>But what does it tell us, that win? That the Wallabies have finished bottoming out and are on the way back up? Or does it mean the Springboks are in an even worse state thus putting an asterisk the size of an obelisk against the result? Former All Blacks coach Graham Henry would, unsurprisingly, go with the latter. He was quoted this morning saying the current Wallabies are \u201cwoeful\u201d and the \u201cthe worst [Wallabies team] I have ever seen\u201d.</p> <p>Indeed, that such a woeful team got a result against the Springboks makes him worry about the state of the game in the once mighty Southern Hemisphere (outside of New Zealand, of course). Then again, the Wallabies\u2019 woefulness has also caused some to reassess the impressiveness of England\u2019s 3-0 sweep of the Aussies in June.</p> <p>While the All Blacks claimed the Rugby Championship with a thumping win against the Springboks in Christchurch tonight, the Wallabies will play their last home Test of the season when they face the Pumas of Argentina in Perth tonight. Captain Stephen Moore has said the Wallabies will try to shake off the anxiety his team have been wearing like a death shroud (I\u2019m paraphrasing with gay abandon) and give the Aussie supporters something else to cheer about before they leave these shores and cross the River Styx (I\u2019m completely off-grid now).</p> <p>For any sweetly deluded Wallabies fans banking on two in a row bear in mind that Argentina, who last played Australia in the World Cup semi-final (which seems like a lifetime ago), are not here in order to play the Wallabies into form. Aside from their 57-22 loss to New Zealand last week (for 50 minutes Argentina held their own) the Pumas have performed reasonably well, splitting games against the Springboks: a 26-24 home win in Salta and a 30-23 away loss in Mbombela.</p> <p>Going on all that, there seems to be little between Australia, South Africa and Argentina at the moment (with New Zealand so far ahead of them all that the dust cloud they created in zooming past them has had time to dissipate). </p> <p>In short, tonight\u2019s game, you would think, will be close. Let\u2019s just hope it crackles and pops in such a way we can forgot for a moment the limp state of Australian rugby.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 6pm (local \u2014 8pm AEST)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57dcd185e4b0a8cdc6238898\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-17T05:17:18.779Z\">6.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Paul Connolly will be in the chair shortly, but until then check out this little tacker in action:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/15/young-rugby-player-in-beast-mode-dominates-tournament-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/537ty\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2721864\"            data-video-name=\"Young rugby player in 'beast mode' dominates tournament \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP|Jukin Media|\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57db04c0e4b067ad30088216\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/15/160915youngrugbyplayer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/15/160915youngrugbyplayer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/15/160915youngrugbyplayer_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/15/young-rugby-player-in-beast-mode-dominates-tournament-video\">Young rugby player in \u2018beast mode\u2019 dominates tournament \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>I imagine it\u2019s the kind of performance Michael Cheika will be hoping for from debutant prop Tom Robertson.</p> </div>   </div>",

In a surprise paper sent to EU leaders on the morning of the summit, the central European quartet also mounted a robust defence of free movement of labour, with an implicit critique of \u201cintra-EU protectionism\u201d. The move follows debates in France on foreign workers undercutting locals and the Brexit vote centred on immigration.</p> <p>These countries will be staunch defenders of the principle of free movement of people in any talks with the UK.

  "<p>Let bygones be bygones? Not if Elizabeth Warren has anything to say about it.</p> <p> This past week marked the eighth anniversary of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers \u2013 and the near collapse of the entire US financial system. And Warren, the crusading Democratic senator from Massachusetts, still hopes to bring some of the individuals responsible for the debacle to justice.</p> <p> When the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) wrapped up its work investigating the causes of the cataclysm, it referred nine individuals to the justice department, noting commission members believed they had identified serious violations of securities laws or other offenses. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/why-not-imprison-bankers-google\">Why don\u2019t bankers go to jail?

Even then, when the Securities and Exchange Commission fined former Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd for misleading investors about the degree to which the mortgage funding entity was at risk of collapsing due its exposure to risky mortgages, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/08/24/sec-fannie-mae-settlement/\">it was Fannie Mae itself that wrote the $100,000 check on Mudd\u2019s behalf</a>, to a special US Treasury account that accepts \u201cgifts\u201d.</p> <p> Thanks to the National Archives, we know the identities of the other individuals the FCIC panel referred to the DoJ to be considered for criminal charges. Among the most notable figures is Robert Rubin, the former treasury secretary who oversaw Wall Street\u2019s deregulation and has held top jobs at two of the biggest beneficiaries of that move, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. </p> <p>Rubin, the FCIC members suggested, may have been responsible \u2013 together with fellow top Citigroup management \u2013 for keeping the value of the mortgage securities that were stuck on the bank\u2019s balance sheet and for which they couldn\u2019t find buyers, inflated. That meant they could hide the extent to which Citi was exposed to subprime mortgages, declaring at one point it was 76% lower than the actual levels. That may rise to the level of fraud. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dd9b5d7165dd8d54612b2eb248ee18de9a4d281\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dd9b5d7165dd8d54612b2eb248ee18de9a4d281/0_117_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former treasury secretary Robert Rubin in 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former treasury secretary Robert Rubin in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Cedeno/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another name on the list is that of Charles Prince, Citi\u2019s CEO, who achieved fame/infamy for his comment that \u201cas long as the music is playing, you\u2019ve got to get up and dance\u201d. At the FCIC hearings, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/money/chuck-prince-quote-citi-dancing-crisis-worsened-haunts-panel-inquiry-article-1.165694\">he tried to argue</a> that no individual bank had the power to stop the madness that led up to the financial crisis: as long as his competitors kept making more reckless loans, he had no choice but to follow suit \u2013 and keep dancing. </p> <p>The problem is that whining that \u201cwell, Joey was doing it, too, and he made me do it\u201d is the kind of excuse that goes out of fashion by the time you\u2019re a teenager. It\u2019s inappropriate in a middle-schooler, much less a middle-aged man. </p> <p>And yet, as Elizabeth Warren points out, the DoJ has been sitting on a list of middle-aged bankers for several years now. It\u2019s unclear to what extent any wrongdoing can still be prosecuted, given that the statute of limitations will apply to many of these cases. </p> <p>But at the very least, the DoJ can explain why they failed to act, as she has requested.</p> <p>True, financial crimes can be tough to prosecute: the issues are complex and lend themselves to finger-pointing, with everyone pointing to someone else as the culprit. </p> <p>And some of the trials that have taken place haven\u2019t had results that would necessarily have encouraged the DoJ. Most recently, several the traders accused of being involved in rigging the key Libor interest rate, affecting the cost of trillions of dollars of loans, mortgages and other financial deals, and who were known by names like \u201cLord Libor\u201d and \u201cBig Nose\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jan/29/serious-office-back-in-the-dock-after-libor-acquittals\">were acquitted</a> in trials. A <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubs-ag-banking-weil-idUSKBN0IN26820141104\">Swiss private banker</a> was acquitted of helping his US clients duck taxes in a Miami trial. </p> <p>In one of a handful of cases directly linked to the financial crisis itself, the managers of a Bear Stearns hedge fund that collapsed in 2007 after investing in subprime mortgage securities were accused of securities fraud. It was supposed to be an easy win for prosecutors in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/business/11bear.html?_r=0\">jurors acquitted the two men in late 2009</a>. In fact, one of the only major courtroom victories came in 2013, when \u201cthe fabulous Fab\u201d, aka former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre, was <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/former-goldman-trader-tourre-says-he-will-not-appeal/\">found liable by a federal jury</a> for defrauding investors in a mortgage deal that made hedge fund managers who took the other side of the deal a lot of money \u2013 but cost the investors millions. </p> <p>But this was a civil, not a criminal case, and Tourre had to pay monetary damages, not spend any time in jail. Goldman Sachs, too, forked over $550m to settle related charges, neither admitting nor denying any wrongdoing in the matter, a phrase calculated to drive Warren and all of Wall Street\u2019s other critics around the bend. No one has gone to jail.</p> <p>Perhaps this would matter a little less \u2013 a little, a very little \u2013 if Wall Street\u2019s arrogance had been dimmed by the events of 2008. Or if it the Libor trading scandal hadn\u2019t flared up, or if JP Morgan Chase hadn\u2019t experienced the <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/19/investing/jpmorgan-london-whale-fine/\">London Whale derivative trading losses</a>, the latter ultimately costing the bank $6bn. In neither case has anyone been marched off to jail.

  "<p>One recent Saturday morning, a friend who was staying with me for the weekend looked frightened as he walked into my living room minutes after waking up. As he sat down in a chair, he told me about the nightmare he\u2019d just had: he was walking through Chicago and somebody shot him, for no reason.<br></p> <p>No reason, perhaps, but it\u2019s not an irrational fear for a young black man, as we both are. This year has been one of the city\u2019s deadliest in decades, with seemingly unending gun violence that already has taken over 500 lives (already outpacing last year\u2019s 481) and only continues to climb as the city has surpassed <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-chicago-violence-shootings-3000-20160912-story.html\">3,000 shootings just this year </a>\u2013 a 47% increase compared to this time last year.</p> <p>In all my years in Chicago, I\u2019ve only heard gunshots while crime reporting on the south or west sides of the city, never in the neighborhoods where I have lived, which are all on the north side and are considered \u201cwhite\u201d neighborhoods. Due to the south side having <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/\">a long history of redlining and housing discrimination</a>, the city has become one of the most segregated places in the US \u2013 and thus the violence has been largely isolated.</p> <p>With this in mind, I reassured my friend by telling him shootings don\u2019t happen here: that didn\u2019t happen here. By weekend\u2019s end, he safely went back home to Indiana.</p> <p>The following Monday, a south side Chicago police officer found himself grieving the death of his son, Arshell Dennis III, after he was shot dead before returning to college in New York this fall. </p> <p>Eight other victims were killed that weekend in addition to the 54 non-fatal shootings, including a six-year-old girl slain while playing on the sidewalk in a South Side neighborhood. All victims were black.</p> <p>Later that week, I saw that <a href=\"https://pics.onsizzle.com/austin-belmont-cra-gin-crime-mayhem-9-people-3295726.png\">a meme had emerged</a> on Facebook contrasting yet another violent weekend with another pressing matter miles away, on the other side of town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2141d0b6d543b2467a31710cc002565e72cb3d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2141d0b6d543b2467a31710cc002565e72cb3d2/0_0_500_610/410.png\" alt=\"austin-belmont-cra-gin-crime-mayhem-9-people-3295726\" width=\"410\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Over the past year, residents of the upscale north side neighborhood of Gold Coast, an area close to where I live, have been<a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150701/gold-coast/mariano-park-suitors-pitch-feisty-gold-coast-crowd\"> divided and even protesting</a> over the question of which business would get the franchise for a historic cafe in a the popular Mariano Park. </p> <p>After months of community meetings, a local coffee shop won the bid and opened for business in time for this summer. But the locals were far from happy: they began complaining to local media that the gelato vendor that the cafe brought with them, Black Dog, <a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160815/gold-coast/gold-coast-gelato-wars-some-residents-say-deserve-better-dessert\">was not good enough</a>. Residents began collecting signatures for a petition to replace the vendor. It was an impressive effort of community activism.</p> <p>As these two news stories unfolded through social media that week, I allowed myself a rueful smile. Not because any of it was actually funny, but at the sad absurdity of a city where two worlds can co-exist yet never intersect, and where the quality of gelato in park cafe can be as pressing a concern as the constant toll of gun death among black people.</p> <p>Local police and even the mayor continually point to gangs as the cause, but a number of activists and community members argue that blaming it on gangs doesn\u2019t speak to larger issues at play: segregation, poverty and lack of social mobility.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you remove resources, economic opportunities, don\u2019t invest in education, create a difficult route to obtain quality housing, remove black leadership by mass incarceration, it creates a formula for disaster,\u201d said activist William Calloway, who worked to releasing the infamous <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-laquan-mcdonald-police-dashboard-short-video-premiumvideo.html\">Laquan McDonald dashboard camera footage</a>.</p> <p>The same community has to fight the incredible closure of <a href=\"http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/repurposing-cps-schools-closure-vacant/Content?oid=23462075\">over 50 public schools</a>, has to fight for <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/chicago-mental-health-protests_n_1591449.html\">mental health clinics to be re-opened</a>, and has to fight for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/08/obama-library-university-chicago-trauma-center-protests\">Level 1 trauma center</a> instead of a presidential library (the south side has been without one for decades). To make matters worse, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-youth-unemployment-urban-league-0126-biz-20160124-story.html\">half of young black men</a> in Chicago are out of a job. </p> <p>Activists constantly argue its the disappearance of resources that needs emergency response in order to curb violence. But instead, the city rolls out programs such as the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/undeclared-war-chicago-grapples-with-historic-gun-violence/\">\u201cstrategic subject list\u201d</a>, a predictive tactic to identify those who will be repeated offenders connected to gun violence. </p> <p>When looking at maps of the shootings, one can overlay them with maps of census tract data on ethnicity and economic status and see a direct correlation: white areas don\u2019t see as many shootings, while black and Latino areas see <a href=\"http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2012/07/26/concentrated-poverty-and-homicide-in-chicago\">the majority of them and are also poorer</a>. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The poverty [we face], divestment, over-policing, police terror exist outside the experiences of the city\u2019s  privileged</p> <footer> <cite>Aislinn Sol</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Aislinn Sol, a leader of the local Black Lives Matter movement, told me \u201cthe extreme poverty [we face], divestment, over-policing, police terror exist outside the experiences of the city\u2019s wealthy, privileged and white constituents,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is an issue of extreme privilege to not be bothered by the rampant violence that is a direct result of disinvestment in our communities.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the north side, I\u2019ve seen first hand how little people think about the gun crisis unfolding at their doorstep. When they watch the evening news, the tragedy that is everyday life in black and brown parts of the city seems like it is happening in a far-off land. It\u2019s <em>there</em>, not <em>here</em>.</p> <p>In many ways, I benefit from this privilege even as a black person, because I am able to live <em>here</em>, in a \u201cwhite\u201d neighborhood. But I\u2019ve also had drunken north-siders tell me and my friends to \u201cgo back to your side of town\u201d. Once, I even encountered a group of white men in baseball jerseys who yelled \u201cObama nigger-monkey\u201d at me. </p> <p>All I was doing was walking to the bakery.</p> <p>Another time, I hosted a brunch for a group of black gay men. My white neighbors decided they didn\u2019t like seeing \u201cporch monkeys\u201d on my deck and lit their grill underneath it. As smoke from the fire began to billow up, they shouted racist and homophobic epithets. Later that week, these same neighbors told another resident that the \u201ccolored boys\u201d were ruining their community.</p> <p>Yes, there were also friends and sympathetic neighbors who, hearing about the incident, reached out immediately. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that happened here,\u201d they said, again and again. But of course it would happen here. This is how the neighborhood policing of segregation works, and why the solution for violence across town isn\u2019t to just move: because there will always be a hurdle for people of color to obtain the same privileges as the ones white people enjoy, no matter where we live.</p> <p>As long as the north side can remain unbothered by gun violence, people on my side of town will continue to nonchalantly go on about their lives. They\u2019ll carry on worrying about gelato, not black lives. Those just aren\u2019t sweet enough. </p>",

The next president must stand with all people oppressed in our hemisphere.\u201d At past rallies, Trump has often been prone to suggesting, if elected, Clinton would turn the United States into Venezuela.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38469b2902e60780b405cf181687b77f7a34b7ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38469b2902e60780b405cf181687b77f7a34b7ad/0_0_3500_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump with his \u2018Les Deplorables\u2019 banner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump with his \u2018Les Deplorables\u2019 banner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mostly, however, Trump\u2019s speech relied on the familiar themes of attacking Clinton\u2019s \u201clies and corruption\u201d; supporting the nation\u2019s veterans and rebuilding the \u201cdepleted\u201d military; repealing Obamacare and \u201cmaking deals\u201d that would create jobs in \u201cunbelievable numbers\u201d, saying \u201cAmerican hands will rebuild this nation\u201d.</p> <p>Yet despite the enthusiastic reception, and poll numbers giving Trump his <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html\">first lead in Florida since early August</a>, Trump has work to do in Miami-Dade, the only one of Florida\u2019s 67 counties the Republican nominee failed to win in the party\u2019s March primary.

He sat down briefly with Haitian-American leaders at a community center while a handful of protestors carrying a \u201cLittle Haiti says no to Trump\u2019s racism and hate\u201d placard waited outside.</p> <p>Later, during Trump\u2019s early-evening speech at Miami\u2019s James L Knight Center, Trump blamed Democrat policies for failures in inner cities and promised to \u201cbring back jobs\u201d, pitching directly to traditionally Democratic-leaning black voters.</p> <p>\u201cDemocrats have run these inner-cities for half a century \u2026 and all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime and failing schools,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.

  "<p>As thousands <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/sep/16/new-york-fashion-week-numbers\">of people</a> flocked to New York this past week for New York Fashion Week, the great cycle began again. Clothes worn by the models will make their way from the runway to fashion desks and designer stores and then to people\u2019s closets. Some of the most expensive pieces will make it to consignment stores offering bargain hunters the chance to snap up high-end clothing at affordable prices.</p> <p>Consignment stores that let fashionistas trade their clothes for cash have been with us for decades but now there\u2019s a growing appetite for secondhand clothes stores specializing in high-end labels. Everyone seems to benefit. The rich get to offload last season\u2019s looks and the rest of us get to shop the closets of the in-crowd and the 1%.</p> <p>Department stores have experienced a drop in sales and stores like <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/22/sears-kmart-stores-close-where/\">Sears</a>, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/27/gap-closing/\">Gap</a>, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/11/investing/macys-closes-100-stores/\">Macy\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/29/in-big-shakeup-kate-spade-to-close-saturday-stores.html\">Kate Spade</a> have all announced that they were shuttering shops across the country but resale shops, on the other hand, enjoyed an increase in sales in 2015. </p> <p>The resale industry \u2013 including not-for-profit stores like thrift shops \u2013 grew at about 7% a year in 2014 and 2015, <a href=\"http://www.narts.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3286\">according to the National Association of Resale Professionals (Narts).</a> It also saw an increase in inventory with more people looking to make money off of their clothes, <a href=\"http://www.narts.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3290\">according to Narts</a>.</p> <p>Consignment stores are winning because they have a smart business model, said Tammy Fluhr-Gates, whose family founded and still owns <a href=\"http://www.michaelsconsignment.com/\">Michael\u2019s</a> on Madison Avenue in New York. Michael\u2019s opened in 1954 and was among the first consignment stores in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f1029305fadf9d26aab6c924de2e916af8a2f000\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1029305fadf9d26aab6c924de2e916af8a2f000/0_0_8773_2672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michaels panaroma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"305\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside a <a href=\"http://www.michaelsconsignment.com\">Michael\u2019s store</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Michael's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much overhead because we don\u2019t own the merchandise. We don\u2019t have to project six months out for what the trend will be and can change on a dime,\u201d Fluhr-Gates explained. Consignment stores can adjust prices according to whatever is happening that day \u2013 whether there are more people buying or selling. \u201cThere are few businesses where everyone feels like they are winning.\u201d</p> <p>Consignors are winning because they are able to monetize a piece of clothing they no longer need or want. Shoppers win because they get a piece of high-end clothing at a discount. The consignment store wins by \u201cbringing them together\u201d.</p> <p>On average, Americans selling their clothes get from <a href=\"http://www.narts.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3286\">40% to 60%</a> of the selling price. The rest goes to the store.</p> <p>About 80% of clothes taken in by Michael\u2019s are sold within the first 30 days, said Fluhr-Gates. \u201cWe price to sell,\u201d she said, adding that consignors should think of clothes as real estate. If you overprice your house, you run the risk of it sitting on the market for too long. \u201cThe same kind of phenomenon can happen in the consignment store.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth Murphy, who along with her husband Ben Malik Karambiri owns three high-end consignment stores called Eleven \u2013 one in Manhattan and two in Brooklyn \u2013 loves the hustle of consigning.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always something new every day whether it\u2019s the consignor being crazy or irate and fighting with us about what she wants for price point or someone coming in and buying $3,000 worth of old Givenchy T-shirts because they collect them,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFRpPWuAmr3/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Just in @elevencboutique.  70 5th Ave BK ny 11217  #lv #louisvuitton 718-399-7767 For shipping email info@elevenconsignment.com</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Eleven Consignment Boutique (@elevencboutique) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-05-11T17:40:40+00:00\">May 11, 2016 at 10:40am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Haggling over prices does not faze Murphy \u2013 there is a specific formula to pricing items at a consignment shop.</p> <p>\u201cAnything that\u2019s not Chanel or Herm\u00e8s immediately depreciates by half the minute you walk out of the store. You bought a Prada dress for $500 from Prada on Fifth Avenue. You walk out the store, it is now worth $250. If the tags are on it, you have never worn it, it\u2019s never been photographed, you\u2019ve never washed it, I am going to keep it at $250. After it sells, you can have a half of that. That\u2019s a 50-50 split. That\u2019s consignment. We are glorified eBay essentially with the different percentage,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it has been washed, loved, abused, you were photographed in it, it has been worn 10 times or it is a mass-produced item, I cut the price in half again so now that $500 dress is at $125. That\u2019s my price point. That\u2019s how I decided prices.\u201d</p> <p>There is a reason why items from Chanel and Herm\u00e8s sell for more: they are unique and the collections are limited.</p> <p>\u201cI tell people the clothes don\u2019t have the best retail value because they are so mass produced. I mean Prada is in 30 states in the United States and 75 countries. This is glorified Zara at that point,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cWhen something becomes mass produced, it loses its value just like any antique or a car. Mass production kills value.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5d0605277e37621b860c57dba766619ff36717b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5d0605277e37621b860c57dba766619ff36717b/0_21_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cA bag will fit everybody.

For one, there was a rise in websites like eBay that enabled people to sell their possessions. Then came the recession. As many Americans found themselves without a raise for years or taking lower-paid jobs to make ends meet, making money off clothes one already owned, as well as buying slightly used clothes at a discount, became more and more appealing.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen everything. We have seen a young girl who got a handbag for Christmas \u2013 she wore it, loved it, abused it \u2013 and now wants to sell it and make some rent money. We have seen a woman from Connecticut sell us four Birkin bags from the back of her car in a parking lot because she is getting a divorce and has to make money. She is selling them under the fly from her husband,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cNine times out of 10, [consignors are] someone who just needs straight money.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QK8mJJJvaes?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Anyone doubting the widespread acceptance and popularity of shopping for used clothes need look no further than Macklemore\u2019s 2013 hit Thrift Shop. The song sat on top of Billboard\u2019s top 100 list for weeks. <a href=\"http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/macklemore-s-thrift-shop-tops-billboard-s-100-hot-rap-songs-of-the-last-25-years-news.9686.html\">It was subsequently deemed</a> \u201cthe most successful track in the 25 years of Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart\u201d.</p> <p>The $20 bill burning a hole in Macklemore\u2019s pocket, however, would do him no good at any of the high-end consignment stores in New York, where price tags can range from a few hundred dollars to a couple of thousand.</p> <p>Despite the prices, the market has gotten slightly younger over the years, said Greg Selig, owner of Encounters. Encounters was the first high-end consignment store to open in the US in 1954. Selig\u2019s mother was a salesperson there before she and her husband bought the store in 1981.</p> <p>\u201cI would say it\u2019s a young girl just out of college, she wants her first job, she wants her first fancy handbag. It\u2019s the woman between 22 and 40 \u2013 they want to keep up with the Joneses. They want to look good. They are practical shoppers. It\u2019s people who are trendsetters. It\u2019s people who go: I can\u2019t go to Macy\u2019s. I can\u2019t go to Bloomingdale\u2019s. I can\u2019t wear the same thing my friend does. I have to wear something super unique. I want to stand out,\u201d Murphy agreed.</p> <p>While the buyers might have gotten younger, consignors remain slightly older.</p> <p>\u201cThe younger audience is not going to be spending $1,200 on a [new] bag in terms of an accessible income. The customer base has gotten younger but in terms of the consignment base \u2013 the people selling the goods \u2013 there\u2019s only so young you can get in terms of who has accessible income\u201d to buy the items often seen on the runway, Selig explained.</p> <p>Fluhr-Gates recalled once telling another reporter that the most expensive item sold at Michael\u2019s was an $18,000 handbag. Who would buy that? Someone rich, she said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who are purchasing from us have the ability to walk down to Herm\u00e8s and buy it from Herm\u00e8s directly, but they understand the value of consignment because they can get it for a few thousand dollars less, which is not chump change,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, because they recognize that recycling has a benefit and that value can also reside in the thrill of the hunt. There is also a psychological aspect to shopping consignment. And you never know what you are going to find.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Imagine you have a sudden burning desire to read<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/30/david-copperfield-dickens-100-best-novels\"><em> David Copperfield</em></a>, Charles Dickens\u2019s favourite of all his novels. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jan/14/project.gutenberg\">Project Gutenberg</a>, you could read it for nothing online but, correctly reasoning that it would be tedious to scroll through 600 pages on a screen, you go to a bookshop. There you find that <em>David Copperfield</em> is available as an Everyman Classic hardback, a Penguin Classic paperback, an Oxford University Press paperback and a Vintage Classic paperback, all designed in pleasing formats, heftily branded and with paintings or artful imagery on their covers, along with introductory essays by university professors, a chronology of Dickens\u2019s life and a scholarly trove of explanatory notes.</p> <p>Which do you choose? Why that one? Because it has the most beautiful cover? Because it looks more \u201ccollectable\u201d for your library shelf at home? Because the colour scheme matches the decor of your living room? Because the introduction is by Professor John Sutherland, say, rather than Norman Carpet from Nowheresville? Think carefully before you choose, because British publishers are putting lots of money and energy into guessing what the new generation of classics buyers wants. This year, the four major contenders \u2013 Penguin, OUP, Everyman and Vintage \u2013 are experimenting with radical new looks, designs and branding strategies, in the hope of snaring their long-term loyalty.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot at stake. From Aristotle to Zola, the classics market is huge. According to Tom Tivnan of the Bookseller magazine, annual sales of classic texts currently stand at \u00a325m, an increase of 10% since 2010. There\u2019s been a noticeable upswing in the number of publishers doing the classics, whether offering cheap editions (like Wordsworth Classics, \u00a31.99 each) or super-deluxe editions on quality paper stock (like the Pushkin, Alma, Persephone and Fitzcarraldo houses). It\u2019s as though British publishing has suddenly realised that anyone can flog a work that\u2019s out of copyright \u2013 usually 70 years after the author\u2019s death \u2013 and they don\u2019t have to pay royalties. This year, publishers have been ghoulishly marking the anniversaries of authors who died in 1946, especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/hgwells\">HG Wells</a> (August 13) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/dec/29/guys-and-dolls-musical-lady-luck-america-damon-runyon-frank-loesser\">Damon Runyon</a> (December 10). And classics publishers can make a lot from TV or film adaptations: the bestselling classic this year is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/war-and-peace-episode-by-episode\"><em>War and Peace</em></a>, with 54,000 copies sold by 10 publishing houses, compared with 12,000 last year. Many classics also see a gratifying spike in sales if they appear on the reading lists of GCSE, A-level or BA syllabuses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14cdb56db2a1654940c53064f574b3c42a595c58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14cdb56db2a1654940c53064f574b3c42a595c58/0_50_4186_2513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BBC War and Peace\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TV adaptations<em> </em>can casuse a massive spike in sales of classic books \u2026 James Norton and Lily James in the BBC\u2019s<em> War and Peace</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Laurie Sparham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The competition between houses is, consequently, intense, and many bold initiatives of marketing and packaging are being tried this year. Most startling is Penguin Classics\u2019 launch of the new-look <a href=\"http://www.pocketpenguins.com/\">20 Penguin Pocket Classics</a>. The books\u2019 main feature is stripped back simplicity: no oil painting on the cover, no artwork or imagery, no introductory essay. The blurb for each book is a single sentence. The jackets are coded in single colours according to the author\u2019s nationality, as the first Penguin Classics were in 1947: blue for French (here represented by Zola\u2019s <em>The Beast Within</em>), red for Russian (Tolstoy\u2019s<em> The Cossacks</em>) and so forth. It\u2019s a stark, functional, slightly garish look, a complete break from the \u201cclassic\u201d Penguin Classic that\u2019s been standard since 1963 \u2013 black-spined and richly designed, with, on the cover, a full-colour reproduction of a painting that bears some relation to the contents.</p> <p>The idea evolved from the wildly successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/24/penguin-little-black-classics-review\">Little Black Classics</a> brought out last year by Penguin publishing director Simon Winder: small format, monochrome booklets of 50 to 100 pages, costing 80p or \u00a31, containing gobbets of poetry, essays, short stories and extracts of prose \u201ccurated\u201d from Kipling, Dante, Browning, Darwin and Wilde. To everyone\u2019s amazement, they sold 3m copies worldwide. The UK bestseller was<em> The Communist Manifesto</em> (can it have contributed to the rise of Jeremy Corbyn?) followed by Nietzsche\u2019s <em>Aphorisms of Love and Hate</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Penguin Classics edition of Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s <em>Complete Poems</em>, of which we sell a few hundred a year,\u201d says Winder. \u201cBut by choosing some of the poems, and packaging them for 80p, liberated from the large format, we sold 30,000 copies. An enormous audience for curated literature has suddenly been conjured up out of nothing.\u201d</p> <p>He asked art director Jim Stoddart to apply the same stripped-back treatment to 20 books from the Classics list. Ten more were published in August. The old-style Classics will still be available. But will the new design eventually be rolled out across the whole range? \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that we have to make books for different kinds of reader,\u201d said Stoddart. \u201cSome people are intimidated by covers with oil paintings. These are more friendly towards that kind of reader. To treat the books as dry academic pieces of literature is just wrong.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2e7e2f489beae1f8dbce559da20b2c19368d070\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2e7e2f489beae1f8dbce559da20b2c19368d070/0_145_5747_3450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Penguin Classics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the earliest books to be published by Penguin Classics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Penguin is using the considerable power of its brand name as the main marketing thrust. But a major change in the new format is the loss of critical bells and whistles \u2013 the \u201capparatus\u201d considered vital for the student buyer.</p> <p>\u201cThe student market is very important to us because we\u2019re part of a university press,\u201d says Luciana O\u2019Flaherty of OUP World\u2019s Classics. \u201cIt\u2019s the core of what we do, which is why we have Introductions and Notes. After that, we have to have an attractive package, to look good on bookshelves. We hope that, if we get the readers when they\u2019re students, they\u2019ll collect us for ever. And some general readers will still want the critical apparatus that we provide. I think some mid-20th century books are hard to read without it.\u201d</p> <p>The World\u2019s Classics imprint was created by a publisher called Grant Richards in 1901, to bring dramatic and classical literature to general readers in pocket sized hardbacks. OUP bought the list in 1905, opened their account with the King James Bible and targeted self-improving Edwardians: \u201cCheaply, and in little shelf space,\u201d ran the publisher\u2019s assurance, \u201cthe general reader can build up a library of those books which, having become a part of himself, he wishes now to make a part of his home.\u201d</p> <p>They were immediately popular. World\u2019s Classics paperbacks, with their distinctive red and white livery, started life in 1983. \u201cI think it was because of the increase in people going to university, and their need for texts,\u201d says Julie Gough from OUP marketing. \u201cUniversity libraries used to buy OUP hardbacks, but fewer were doing so, and students wanted to buy their own books.\u201d After two relaunches, the World\u2019s Classics lists now runs to 790 titles in handsome matt covers, featuring cunningly cropped artworks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jackets are like sweet papers, and it\u2019s difficult to sell sweets without a wrapper</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This autumn, though, they\u2019re offering something new: a range of hardbacks offering \u201cunique content\u201d \u2013 a collection of an author\u2019s works that hasn\u2019t been presented this way before, or a new translation of a classic. Their design is flamboyantly simple: no dust jacket but a cloth binding, a cream background on which title and author are printed vertically with a single tiny image on the top. <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/ukhe/product/gothic-tales-9780198734291?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\"><em>Gothic Tales</em> by Arthur Conan Doyle</a> features a descending crow, Homer\u2019s <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/ukhe/product/the-odyssey-9780199669103?q=odyssey&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=gb\"><em>Odyssey</em></a> shows an image of Odysseus dwarfed by the cyclops Polyphemus, <em>Poems of the First World War</em> offers a soldier\u2019s helmet. They look fantastic \u2013 but who are they for? \u201cWe\u2019re working a lot with the production team to make them look very collectible and tactile, to appeal to the gift market,\u201d says Gough.</p> <p>In 1906, a year after OUP World\u2019s Classics appeared, a master bookbinder called Joseph Dent founded Everyman\u2019s Library, kicking off with Boswell\u2019s <em>Life of Samuel Johnson</em> in two volumes. The son of a Darlington housepainter, Dent had educated himself through reading, and was determined to publish handsome editions of the world\u2019s classic books at a shilling a pop. Though opportunistic publishers in the 1900s could bring out individual reprints of Ovid and Virgil in translation, Dent offered a multi-classic, build-your-own library in a William Morris-inspired livery that twined fruits and flowers over the title pages and endpapers.</p> <p>From the 1920s to the 1940s, everyone bought their personal libraries of Herodotus, Chaucer, Shakespeare and Milton in flat-spined Everyman hardbacks. A paperback list was started in 1960 to rival Penguin and OUP, but in 1991 the company was sold and Everyman\u2019s Library restarted as a \u201chardback permanent library of record\u201d (as John Updike called it) under David Campbell, an old-school craftsman publisher. Using the French publisher Gallimard\u2019s design model from 1912, he used sewn-cloth bindings, acid-free paper, silk ribbons and cream <em>collection blanche</em> jackets with black and red typography, for a look that\u2019s timelessly elegant and had no truck with photographs, cover art or other such abominations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"317719264d079f2fc76f4352db32fa8e725428c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/317719264d079f2fc76f4352db32fa8e725428c5/0_0_1522_2098/725.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage Classics Jane Austen Emma.\" width=\"725\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new Vintage Classics design for Jane Austen\u2019s <em>Emma.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until he changed his mind. \u201cMy children pointed out that I might be missing a trick by not having cover art like everyone else,\u201d says Campbell, who this year celebrates 25 years in the business and has just seen his 27 millionth book printed in Germany. \u201cWe tried film tie-in covers, but it was a disaster. We had letters from all over the world saying, \u2018We want a proper Everyman cover, not some frightful picture of a film star.\u2019 So we stopped that. But I think a bit of variety does no harm. Jackets are like sweet papers, and it\u2019s difficult to sell sweets without a wrapper.\u201d</p> <p>Of Everyman\u2019s 650 titles, their Contemporary Classics series features cover photographs of authors, while their 850-page <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/classics//catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307267504\"><em>Annals and Histories by Tacitus </em></a>is garishly frontaged by Hubert Robert\u2019s painting <a href=\"http://www.muma-lehavre.fr/en/collections/artworks-in-context/15th-18th-century/robert-fire-rome\"><em>The Burning of Rome</em></a>. But Campbell\u2019s main concession to the classics packaging war is in curating: his newest innovation has been the launch of <a href=\"http://www.everymanslibrary.co.uk/pocket-classics-collections.aspx\">Everyman\u2019s Pocket Classics</a>, gatherings of short stories \u2013 <em>Bedtime Stories</em>,<em> Cat Stories</em>, <em>Christmas Stories</em>, <em>Paris Stories</em> \u2013 garnered from collections already published by Everyman. All the books have been given a distinctive spine of pastel stripes, seemingly inspired by the acid greens and pale pinks of Sobranie Cocktail cigarettes. \u201cIt\u2019s really very simple,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cBeautifully designed things sell better than badly designed ones.\u201d</p> <p>At Vintage Classics, they\u2019re not plugging simplicity or stripped down design. Nor are they trying to attract students with academic paraphernalia. Vintage are unlike their rivals in extending the word \u201cclassic\u201d to mean literary works by living writers (Amis, Barnes, McEwan, Rushdie). \u201cIt\u2019s like a promise for the future that these books are here to stay,\u201d says senior editor Frances McMillan. Their classics are instantly identifiable by their red spines, while their Introductions are by non-academic authors (such as Howard Jacobson on <em>Catch-22</em>) or cultural figures (Cerys Matthews on <em>Cider with Rosie</em>).</p> <p>Their design template has long ignored the oil painting cover in favour of clever imagery. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the desirability of books and what they say about you,\u201d says art director<a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/in-conversation/interviews/2016/jan/26/julian-barnes-and-suzanne-dean/\"> Suzanne Dean</a>. \u201cAs with your clothes, your room and your pictures, the books on your shelves are reflections of yourself, your taste.\u201d</p> <p>The newest designs for Vintage Classics bear out this philosophy: they deal in designs that might be seen on wallpaper, fabrics, rugs and mugs.

  "<p>Barack Obama is expected to make a final decision next month on possible cuts to the US nuclear arsenal, in an attempt to consolidate his legacy as a disarmer before leaving office.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/west-failing-deliver-nuclear-deal-promises-iran-vice-president-ali-akbar-salehi\">West failing to deliver nuclear-deal promises, says Iran vice president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Options on the table include reducing the number of deployed strategic warheads, slimming down the reserve stockpile, cutting military stores of fissile material available for making new warheads, and putting off some modernisation plans, including the a controversial air force programme for developing an air-launched cruise missile. </p> <p>The president is due to consult his principal national security officials in October on which, if any, of the options are still feasible in the time left before he leaves office.</p> <p>Some more radical options, like changing the US nuclear posture to rule out first use of nuclear arms in a conflict and taking some of the nation\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missiles off hair-trigger alert, have faced such strong opposition from allies abroad and the Pentagon that they are no longer being seriously considered. </p> <p>\u201cWe have paid a lot of attention throughout the administration,\u201d an administration official said, pointing to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2015/feb/05/in-the-us-russian-relationship-something-nuclear-that-works\">New Start Treaty</a> with Russia in 2010, changes to US nuclear posture the same year that ruled out strikes on non-nuclear states, work on improving the security of nuclear stockpiles around the world, and last year\u2019s agreement limiting the scope of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/west-failing-deliver-nuclear-deal-promises-iran-vice-president-ali-akbar-salehi\">Iran\u2019s nuclear programme</a>. </p> <p>Unable to persuade the Senate to reconsider ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the White House has backed a United Nations security council resolution, due to be passed on Thursday, that reaffirms member states\u2019 commitment not to conduct explosive nuclear testing. The administration official said there might be more steps to come before Obama leaves office in January.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a whole lot of other steps the administration is looking at, and right now it is an open book as to what will be decided,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Nuclear disarmament was one of the signature ambitions of Obama\u2019s first months in office. In a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-barack-obama-prague-delivered\">speech in Prague in April 2009</a>, he pledged US commitment \u201cto seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons\u201d. However, he approaches the end of his eight years in office having made <a href=\"https://fas.org/blogs/security/2016/05/hiroshima-stockpile/\">fewer reductions</a> to the US arsenal than any president since the end of the cold war.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He has good a record on the nuclear issue but it probably falls short of his own hopes for progress</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Einhorn, former state adviser</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, part of the price of persuading the Senate to accept the New Start Treaty was agreeing to a modernisation programme of air, land and sea delivery systems, as well as warheads, that is expected to bring the cost of the US deterrent to $1tn over 30 years. </p> <p>Robert Einhorn, the state department\u2019s special adviser on non-proliferation and disarmament from 2009-13, argues that Obama did the best he could in difficult circumstances. </p> <p>\u201cHe has good a record on the nuclear issue but it probably falls short of his own hopes for progress,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/robert-einhorn/\">Einhorn</a>, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe was operating in an environment that was not at all conducive. Unfortunately the whole Prague agenda has become so politicised there is little room for manoeuvre and you have an international climate that is not terribly conducive.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe US has been prepared to reduce our deployed stockpile a third below New Start. Russia has said it has zero interest.\u201d</p> <p>Disarmament advocates like <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/about/dkimball\">Daryl Kimball</a>, executive director of the Arms Control Association, say unfavourable circumstances at home and abroad are only a partial excuse. </p> <p>\u201cObama has missed multiple opportunities to realise lasting change in nuclear weapons policy,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cHe has adjusted but not transformed the issue. Part of that is a failure of leadership and imagination. He now has a disappointing legacy.\u201d</p> <p> However, Kimball said it was not too late to improve that legacy, even in the last months of the Obama presidency.</p> <p>The most far-reaching option still under active consideration is a one-third cut to the US deployed strategic arsenal, from the 1,550 warheads agreed with Moscow in the New Start Treaty to just over 1,000. Obama offered to make the reduction in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/19/remarks-president-obama-brandenburg-gate-berlin-germany\">2013 speech in Berlin</a>, on condition Russia did the same. But Vladimir Putin has shown little interest in disarmament, instead emphasising his country\u2019s nuclear might.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What Obama could and should do now is act on our own determination on what it is that we need</p> <footer> <cite>Daryl Kimball, Arms Control Association</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Berlin offer was based on a US assessment that it could reduce its nuclear missile arsenal by a third and still \u201cmaintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent\u201d. On the basis of that assessment, disarmers inside and outside the administration have argued that Washington should make the cut unilaterally for cost-saving reasons and to make a more convincing argument to non-weapons states that the US is sticking to its side of the bargain in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. </p> <p>\u201cWhat Obama could and should do now is act on our own determination on what it is that we need, and that we\u2019re not going to tie our budget decisions and arsenal to Russia\u2019s decisions,\u201d Kimball said, pointing out that both presidents Bush made unilateral reductions to US nuclear force levels without being blocked by Congress. However, the current Obama proposal is strongly opposed by the Department of Defense, which is concerned it would send a message of weakness to Moscow. </p> <p>\u201cThere would have been a small chance of that before, but what happened in Crimea and the Donbass wiped that off the table,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/steven-pifer/\">Steven Pifer</a>, a former senior state department official deeply involved in past relations with Moscow and arms control. </p> <p>More politically palatable options on the table are a reduction to the \u201chedge\u201d stockpile of <a href=\"https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/\">more than 2,500 reserve</a> warheads and military stores of hundreds of tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU) held for the production of future warheads. Both are widely considered being surplus to requirements.</p> <p>In a 2013 Nuclear Employment Strategy document, it was decided that the warheads held in reserve as a hedge against technical failures in deployed weapons could also serve as a hedge against geopolitical surprises, rather than having two separate reserves. However, the consequent cut to the stockpile has not yet been made.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a chance they will announce a reduction of the hedge,\u201d said <a href=\"https://fas.org/expert/hans-kristensen/\">Hans Kristensen</a>, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. \u201cBut they would in any case not cut the whole hedge, perhaps about 50% of it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/faculty-staff/zia-mian/\">Zia Mian</a>, from the programme on science and global security at Princeton University, said fissile material stocks could also be cut. They are now believed to constitute 243 tons of HEU and 38 tons of plutonium.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf say, a typical US warhead has 25kg of HEU and 4kg of plutnium, then if the US were to reduce to 1,000 operational warheads (as Obama says they can) and say 1,000 reserve warheads, it would need only 50 tons of HEU and eight tons of plutonium for its nuclear arsenal and the rest could be declared excess,\u201d Mian said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/13/us-nuclear-bombers-fly-over-korean-peninsula-in-joint-exercises-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52z8v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2714283\"            data-video-name=\"US nuclear bombers fly over Korean peninsula in joint exercises \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d7b3a6e4b08465d45001da\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/13/160913SouthKoreaBombers1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/13/160913SouthKoreaBombers1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/13/160913SouthKoreaBombers1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/13/us-nuclear-bombers-fly-over-korean-peninsula-in-joint-exercises-video\">US nuclear bombers fly over Korean peninsula in joint exercises</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A further option known to be under consideration would be delaying some of the ambitious nuclear modernisation programmes that are still in their very early stages. A planned air force fleet of nuclear-capable B-21 stealth bombers <a href=\"http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=2299\">is priced at $80bn</a>, while proposed nuclear long-range stand-off cruise missiles are estimated to cost $30bn. </p> <p>Critics have said it is unclear how such weapons <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/USNuclearModernization\">will be funded</a> when the major expenditure is due in the 2020s, and that each makes the other redundant. The cruise missiles have been described as potentially destabilising because they can be launched without warning and are impossible to distinguish from their conventional counterparts. </p> <p>\u201cIf you now have the B-21 coming online able to penetrate enemy defences, why do you need a cruise missile, and if the B-21 is not going to penetrate, why is it being developed? The military is asking for things it may not need,\u201d Pifer said. </p> <p>\u201cI would like to see them cancel the cruise missile. It would be a useful change, but I just can\u2019t see them doing it in the last few months of the administration.\u201d </p> <p>Even staunch arms control advocates such as <a href=\"http://www.ploughshares.org/about-us/staff-board/joseph-cirincione\">Joseph Cirincione</a> of the Ploughshares Fund said the administration may have left it too late to make meaningful changes.</p> <p>\u201cThey took their eye off the ball,\u201d Cirincione said. \u201cIf last year they wanted to do some of these things, it would have been easier. Now it\u2019s not outside elements that are the only problem, but the politics during the presidential election. I would be surprised if they did anything controversial.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>A footballer\u2019s career does not end when he retires. The reputation of a player can change after the event because of anything from evolution to nostalgia. Some players have their achievements diminished by the next generation; others age beautifully. For the Brazilian Ronaldo, who turns 40 on Sunday, this is particularly acute. A number of forwards, from Thierry Henry to Lionel Messi, have achieved greatness \u2013 and in some cases surpassed him \u2013 by paying homage to his style of play; another has changed how we respond to his name. The need to distinguish the two Ronaldos has led to some unflattering comments. In 2013, when considering the merits of both, Sir Alex Ferguson absent-mindedly spoke for many in both his judgment and description. \u201cIf I compare Cristiano with the fat one, the old one, Cristiano is better.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/09/golden-goals-niall-quinn-and-kevin-phillips-for-sunderland-v-chelsea-1999\">Golden Goals: Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips for Sunderland v Chelsea (1999) | Rob Smyth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fat one.

Even before Cristiano, there were two Ronaldos: the one that returned after long-term injury in 2002 was a great goalscorer, but the 1990s version was a great everything.</p> <p>The knee injuries suffered at Internazionale took away the explosiveness that made him possibly the greatest young footballer of all time, a futuristic fusion of speed, strength and skill. That is not to belittle Ronaldo\u2019s achievements in the second half of his career, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jul/01/worldcupfootball2002.sport\" title=\"\">he scored eight goals in a single World Cup</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/apr/24/championsleague.sport\" title=\"\">became the first Ronaldo to receive a standing ovation at Old Trafford</a>, but it is the memory of the early years that puts mist in the eyes of grown men.</p> <p>By the time he suffered his first career-threatening injury in 1999, Ronaldo was 23 and had already scored more than 200 goals for Cruzeiro, PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona, Inter and Brazil. His solitary season at Barcelona went straight into folklore: he scored 47 in 49 games, many of them outrageous solo goals. That total looks relatively tame since the bar was raised by the other Ronaldo and Messi, but at the time it was almost unprecedented. In quantitative terms, you need to judge Ronaldo by the standards of 1996, not 2016. Qualitatively, he stands up to the fiercest contemporary scrutiny. Old football can look relatively slow and clumsy, evolution being what it is, yet Ronaldo\u2019s speed is awesome even to modern eyes.

His famous hat-trick against Valencia in 1996 included two remarkable goals in which he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LccDJzidnLY\" title=\"\">bulldozed through the tiniest gap between defenders</a>. \u201cHe\u2019s not a man,\u201d said the former Real Madrid striker Jorge Valdano. \u201cHe\u2019s a herd.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/01/brazil-olympic-football-gold-decadent-culture-reformed-tite\">Brazil\u2019s Olympic football gold is a step forward but decadent culture must be reformed | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That Barcelona team is seen as one of the great coaching seminars, with Pep Guardiola, Luis Enrique and Laurent Blanc on the pitch and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho on the bench.

His love of dribbling was such that in the majority of his one-on-ones he ran straight past the goalkeeper as if he was just another defender. Other times he would make a fool of the keeper: in the 1998 Uefa Cup final, he used <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4dD5ZZd9tA#t=1m50s\" title=\"\">sleight of hip to put Lazio\u2019s Luca Marchegiani on his backside</a> without touching the ball.</p> <p>At times Ronaldo was so unstoppable that you could have allowed all 11 players to use their hands and he would still have scored. \u201cWhen he stripped, he looked like a boxer,\u201d said Robson. \u201cHe had wonderful biceps and shoulders with terrific definition.\u201d That speed and strength made him football\u2019s Jonah Lomu \u2013 but with the best of David Campese as well. He was very much a head-up dribbler. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a player able to show such precise control at such high speed,\u201d said Marcel Desailly. \u201cWatching him was like watching a character in a video game.\u201d In many ways he was the first PlayStation footballer.

Nesta watched the match repeatedly on video, trying to work out what he had done wrong, until he finally had his Eureka moment: there was nothing anyone could have done. \u201cRonaldo,\u201d he said, \u201cwas simply unstoppable.\u201d</p> <p>Some defenders, particularly in Serie A, would try to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SSIRW753B4&amp;index=12&amp;list=PLbysmzHW5AHbEbCdkTuka-4T9yCidaf1r#t=5m30s\" title=\"\">stop him by foul means or fouler</a>. But for the most part Ronaldo left a great generation of centre-backs at their wits\u2019 end, their brains melting with the demands of concentrating against him for 90 minutes. Gary Neville, who played in the centre of defence against Brazil during Le Tournoi in 1997, recalled Ronaldo and Rom\u00e1rio laughing their heads off at a joke while play was going on at the other end and England\u2019s defenders were gulping oxygen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c079cb7c7cc0332fa2372d9a3065880aa799923e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c079cb7c7cc0332fa2372d9a3065880aa799923e/0_95_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronaldo hoists the World Cup aloft in 2002.

They were drawing 0-0 against Deportivo in a match they had to win to retain a realistic chance of winning the title. Ronaldo went on one last charge but was knocked over 35 yards from goal. He stayed on the floor for a second or two, watching the play; then, when a Deportivo player fractionally miscontrolled the ball, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MciT2RyjMcc\" title=\"\">he sprang to his feet, surged through the defence and scored</a>. One moment he was on his back 35 yards from goal; three touches and four seconds later he was celebrating. It was a perfect summary of his year in Catalonia. \u201cHe\u2019s the most spectacular player I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Luis Enrique, who played with him at the Camp Nou and is now Barcelona\u2019s manager. \u201cHe did things I\u2019d never seen before.

Ronaldo is easily the best of the past 30 years, possibly ever. The other Ronaldo and Messi were brilliant teenagers but had nothing like the same impact at that age. Only Pel\u00e9, Diego Maradona and George Best can really compare. In 1997, aged 21, Ronaldo became the youngest winner of the Ballon d\u2019Or, a record he still holds. He received 38 votes for first place that year; nobody else got more than two. He also broke the world transfer record twice before his 21st birthday; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BsSPoVTRsQ&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLbysmzHW5AHbEbCdkTuka-4T9yCidaf1r\" title=\"\">Maradona is the only other player to break it twice at any age</a>. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for injury I think he would be talked about on the same level as Pel\u00e9 and Maradona,\u201d said the Juventus and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. \u201cHe had all the skills needed to be the best ever. He was like an alien because of what he could do on the pitch.\u201d That is not an isolated view. Robson said: \u201cHad he managed to stay free of injury, he had every chance of becoming the best footballer ever.\u201d</p> <p>Most blame those knee injuries for the fact he peaked so early, though others think it was more down to lifestyle. Either way, the romantic \u201cwhat if\u201d has enhanced his legend in some ways. We get to have our cake and not eat it; to wonder wistfully how good it might have tasted.</p> <p>There are players who have achieved more but nobody has yet replicated Ronaldo\u2019s blend of skill, strength and astonishing speed. He brought the visceral thrill of the 100 metres to the football field. Every time he was involved in an attack it was like a starter pistol went off: on your marks, get set, goal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6789f411be151be3e7168d12f91a1e34577fe84e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6789f411be151be3e7168d12f91a1e34577fe84e/0_181_3585_2151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronaldo on a charity visit to Beijing earlier this year.

  "<p>People are already calling it the fashion moment of 2016.<strong> </strong>In <a href=\"http://www.galerieslafayette.com/\">Galeries Lafayette</a>, an upmarket department store in Paris, cult label <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vetements\">Vetements</a>, purveyor of elevated streetwear, is staging its latest rule-breaking collection. The brand is opening staid old couture fashion week with a show featuring genuinely unexpected collaborations with various other fashion labels \u2013 waist-high <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/manolo-blahnik\">Manolo Blahnik</a> boots, rejuvenated Juicy Couture tracksuits \u2013 and models with a haute level of scowl. But it is when stylist <a href=\"http://lottavolkova.com/\">Lotta Volkova</a> strides past on the catwalk, modelling a floral white and blue Vetements dress, with a dismissive hand holding the corner of a white clutch bag, that the front row\u2019s iPhones are raised in unison. Because that\u2019s the picture. Lotta Volkova modelling the Vetements dress that self-consciously references the Vetements look. In an industry that constantly seeks to label things \u201ccool\u201d, Lotta Volkova has just been crowned as the coolest woman in the world.</p> <p>Volkova is arguably fashion\u2019s most in-demand creative. She is stylist and muse for the Vetements collective, the Paris-based group of designers currently subverting the barriers between streetwear and high fashion. She consults for fashion house <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a> \u2013 on the casting and catwalk shows \u2013 where Demna Gvasalia is creative director. She also works with her friend, the menswear designer, <a href=\"http://gosharubchinskiy.com/\">Gosha Rubchinskiy</a> and a raft of other labels. She somehow squeezes in editorial shoots with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/jan/06/juergen-teller-photography-in-pictures\">Juergen Teller</a> and DJs at her friends\u2019 fanzine launches.

From her Instagram feed</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lotta Volkova Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few days before her Vetements fashion moment, I\u2019m sat in a cool-but-you-have-to-know-it\u2019s-cool-to-realise-it\u2019s-cool cafe in the 10th arrondissement of Paris, not far from the Gare du Nord, asking Volkova how she, as a 32-year-old woman, feels about appearing as a model on the catwalk. Since starting work with Vetements, Volkova has walked in every show alongside kids cast from Instagram and regular models with an edge. Between swigs of Perrier and sips of black coffee, she laughs fast and loud before snapping into her brusque-sounding answering mode.</p> <p>\u201cIt came about really spontaneously and out of the blue. When we were prepping for the first show, we did not have enough models, so Demna was like, \u2018Oh, you are gonna model\u2019 and I was like, \u2018OK fine.\u2019 Of course I was flattered. But for me it was like a friendly gesture. \u2018Try this black turtleneck and sweatpants, and I just want to see you in it\u2019 and I put in on and he was like, \u2018Oh yeah, this is the opening look.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Nawwwww....\u2019\u201d Her speech is peppered with a Baltic-accented vocal fry that is too compelling not to mention.</p> <p>\u201cSpontaneous\u201d and \u201cout of the blue\u201d are phrases that Volkova returns to regularly. Those and the fact that she and her gang are \u201cjust doing what we laaaav\u201d. Volkova\u2019s rise to the pinnacle of high fashion was neither exponential nor intentional, but not wholly surprising either. Born in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/18/vladivostok-new-super-casinos-rejuvenate-the-city\">Vladivostok</a>, Russia, in 1984, Lotta was exposed to rebellion early on. Her father had jumped on a train from Siberia when he was 16 to captain a ship. Her mother, a professor of physics at medical school, instilled in Lotta the idea of doing things her own way: \u201cFor her that was a rebellion against communism, against this pre-packaged life.\u201d It is her mother, too, that she has to thank for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ledzeppelin\">Led Zeppelin</a>-inspired name (she\u2019s named after the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0utAHY3xo4\">Whole Lotta Love)</a>. \u201cShe liked the whole post-punk, early 80s, alt-rock era, so I grew up sucking in all those references.\u201d It was also her mother who fuelled her love of fashion, taking 12-year-old Lotta on shopping trips to London and Tokyo. \u201cI had Prada shoes and Dior by Galliano jumpers, she was wearing Galliano herself. She is tiny and has really big boobs and is blonde, but then she pretty much looks like me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfbc8f988ee4c02a0af0c969a0caa1d06dec809c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfbc8f988ee4c02a0af0c969a0caa1d06dec809c/0_0_3104_4637/669.jpg\" alt=\"Lotta Volkova wearing Vetements.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fashion moment of 2016: Volkova in the Vetements SS/17 show in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giannoni/WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sociopolitical landscape of the early 90s also had a powerful impact on Volkova\u2019s taste; apparently high fashion in 2016 owes quite a debt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/10/eurotrash-is-back-brexit-special-we-have-a-guy-who-paints-portraits-with-his-penis\">Antoine de Caunes and his 90s TV show Eurotrash</a>. After 1991 the cultural influences from Europe and America flooded into eastern Europe: \u201cSuddenly you had these crazy things on television and people started talking about fashion and art,\u201d Volkova recalls. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a Russian character trait \u2013 we look for something new and we are quick learners in a way.\u201d That, coupled with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/22/the-best-oscars-dresses-ever\">Marjan Pejoski\u2019s swan dress for Bj\u00f6rk at the 2001 Oscars ceremony</a>, indelibly formed Volkova\u2019s left-field taste. \u201cFor me fashion was about expressing how different you are, you know?\u201d</p> <p>As with all stylists, Volkova\u2019s taste is her currency, and hers is particularly esoteric. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lottavolkova/?hl=en\">Her Instagram account</a> forms a visual stream of consciousness which for those in her aesthetic network makes complete sense. Not everybody will understand quite how a picture of a wolf with a glass of red wine on its back chimes with raw 4am post-DJ stint snaps and Soviet era tracksuit bottoms. But that\u2019s the point. Her taste relies on a balance of street and haute. Grunge for a generation of \u201clikers\u201d. So specific and individual is her look that the phrase \u201cThat\u2019s a bit Lotta\u201d has, in fashion terms, now become synonymous with anything unexpectedly cool with just a hint of a scowl.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The phrase 'That\u2019s a bit Lotta' has become synonymous with anything unexpectedly cool with just a hint of a scowl</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When we meet, Volkova is looking \u201cvery Lotta\u201d. She is wearing a blue Vetements pinstripe shirt, jeans by <a href=\"http://www.john-lawrence-sullivan.com/\">John Lawrence Sullivan</a>, a label she consults for, lace-up Vans with white socks which betray her skate kid credentials, a diagonal neon green Shellac manicure from a no-frills salon, her trademark severe parted short hair and large steel-framed glasses. It\u2019s a strange cocktail of Wall Street and backstreet, coupled with her extraordinary face, blank yet engaging, and her gangly frame; Volkova is not someone who blends in. Does she know she is physically intimidating? \u201cI think a lot of people would describe me as extremely direct! It\u2019s quite a Russian thing that you come across as quite stern and a bit cold, but once you get to know me I am quite a warm person.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8e2a069f609c7b56c38bcf2e025ac24501c0995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8e2a069f609c7b56c38bcf2e025ac24501c0995/0_17_2065_3017/684.jpg\" alt=\"Lotta Volkova on the catwalk in a Vetements autumn/winter 2016 show at Paris Fashion Week.\" width=\"684\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volkova in the Vetements AW/16 show in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 17, encouraged by her mother, Volkova arrived in London to complete a three-month course in art and design at Central St Martins. Was she nervous? \u201cNo. I was excited\u2026 My whole childhood and teenage years I was just bored, waiting to grow up and live life by myself.\u201d Unsurprisingly Volkova didn\u2019t return to Russia when the course finished, instead submerging herself in London life, partying at electroclash nights such as Nag Nag Nag and Trash. By 2004 Volkova had started her own brand (which of course \u201ccame about really naturally\u201d), dressing herself and her friends for that scene. The label \u201cLotta Skeletrics\u201d riffed heavily on DIY punk heritage and featured T-shirts overloaded with studs and sandpaper-distressed jeans. In classic Volkova hi-low style, these clothes were worn with experimental makeup, but also with beautiful Prada shoes.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 2008, when she moved to Paris, that Volkova\u2019s styling career started to crystalise. She met Gosha Rubchinskiy, the Comme des Gar\u00e7ons-backed Russian designer who is also a crucial part of the Paris/Russia style nexus. Rubchinskiy is also part of the Vetements family \u2013 his catwalk turn in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/19/dhl-t-shirt-vetements-fashion-paris-catwalk\">Vetements DHL T-shirt</a> on the AW/15 catwalk was broadly hailed as the fashion moment of last year. \u201cWe became friends instantly. We were both born in 1984 and I think that makes a big difference. We have the same references and are interested in the same subcultures.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91862fd50b82c20af3648f8c68947d1a348603cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91862fd50b82c20af3648f8c68947d1a348603cf/0_0_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lotta Volkova on Instagram\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lotta Volkova on Instagram</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lotta Volkova Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three years ago Volkova met her main co-conspirator Demna Gvasalia, who currently designs both Vetements and Balenciaga. \u201cWe were introduced by a mutual friend and he asked me to check out a look-book shoot and I was like, \u2018Wow, the clothes are really beautiful, really well made and really interesting\u2019 but I really didn\u2019t like Demna\u2019s styling. I told him and he said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you do it yourself then?\u2019\u201d Volkova has since morphed into stylist, consultant, muse and, crucially, proto-customer for the designer. \u201cFor Demna it\u2019s important to consider a real woman in his clothes. I am a woman and a customer.\u201d</p> <p>Volkova, Gvasalia and Rubchinskiy are a gang united by their backgrounds and style references growing up in the former Soviet bloc. They combine street labels and a left-field fashion approach which owes much to Maison Martin Margiela, where Gvasalia once worked. And it is the crew\u2019s take on beauty that is wielding the most influence on fashion right now. \u201cOf course conventionally beautiful things are beautiful but everyone finds them beautiful and I find that boring. I want to be inspired by things that not everyone knows.\u201d</p> <p>This translates into high fashion in unexpected ways \u2013 from an anorak on the Balenciaga catwalk presented in the way an atelier would have shown a fur coat in the past \u2013 to office chairs, rather than gilt opera seats, for the front row. \u201cThe chairs were comfy!\u201d Volkova tries to convince me.</p> <p>But she is right. This outlook cuts to the heart of the prevailing mood in fashion. \u201cActually practicality is quite important to us. For everything, in a way. That mentality; things have to be functional.\u201d Granted Volkova\u2019s look isn\u2019t practical in the way most people would understand the term. Vetements\u2019 hooded tops and steroid-level Balenciaga anoraks are not practical in the hiking sense nor comfortable in the TV dinner sense. There is a level of nuance and caveat; a disparity that Volkova almost manages to vocalise. \u201cI know I am saying it\u2019s all about practicality but I hate to be comfortable in a way. I\u2019m good at putting on heels and doing a look. I\u2019m actually shit at really dressing down.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The 1981 Emmy awards opened with a horrifyingly cheesy musical number called One Big Happy Family sung by the casts of 16 shows, including <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075488/\">CHiPs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070992/\">Happy Days </a>and <a href=\"http://www.tv.com/shows/the-love-boat/\">The Love Boat</a>.

While most Emmy awards telecasts are as instantly forgettable as that opening number, the showing by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jan/12/50-best-tv-dramas-31-40\">Hill Street Blues </a>that night helped reshape television history. </p> <p> Right from the swirling, chaotic opening scene of its pilot, Hill Street Blues was a show apart. \u201cMichael Kozoll and I just didn\u2019t want to do a typical cop show,\u201d recalls co-creator <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004766/\">Steven Bochco</a>. </p> <p> Producer and director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387706/\">Gregory Hoblit </a>credits Bochco with assembling gifted iconoclasts such as director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0125111/\">Robert Butler</a>, whose dizzying use of handheld cameras was as startling to audiences in 1981 as Bochco\u2019s and Kozoll\u2019s overlapping dialogue, flawed protagonists, serialized story arcs and gritty realism mixed with dark humor.</p> <p> \u201cI was astounded by the quality at our first screening,\u201d recalls Joe Spano, who played junior officer <a href=\"http://www.hillstreetblues.net/cast/cast.html\">Henry Goldblume</a>. \u201cSteven led audiences to these places that recognized the complexities of life.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Onc3-qaqnbc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Onc3-qaqnbc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Lucy Bates, played by <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/betty-thomas-monologue/n9132\">Betty Thomas</a>, proved a groundbreaking role for a female police officer and the show also created then-rare three-dimensional roles for black actors. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Taurean_Blacque.aspx\">Taurean Blacque</a> and I were given things to do \u2013 we were positive characters, not just window dressing,\u201d says Michael Warren (Bobby Hill). Both Hill and Blacque\u2019s Neil Washington were depicted as more honest, industrious and wholesome than their white partners.</p> <p> \u201cThe writing was absolutely wonderful,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0797725/\">James B Sikking</a> (bullish Swat team leader Howard Hunter). \u201cWe couldn\u2019t wait for the next script.\u201d</p> <p> The cast had an undeniable chemistry, adds Charles Haid (the hotheaded cop <a href=\"http://www.hillstreetblues.net/cast/cast.html\">Andy Renko</a>), which he credits to Bochco. \u201cHe was very much the leader and had certain spirit,\u201d Haid says. \u201cAnd there was an eccentricity within our coterie \u2013 we were a pile of mutts, with our own opinions and eccentricities that created a synergy. I was proud to be one of the mutts.\u201d</p> <p> The critics raved but viewers were notably absent. \u201cWe were too good to succeed,\u201d says Bruce Weitz (undercover cop <a href=\"http://www.writeups.org/michael-belker-biter-hill-street-blues/\">Mick Belker</a>). \u201cThe show required people\u2019s attention and the last thing TV audiences wanted to do back then was pay attention.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cEvery show didn\u2019t end with a nice bow on it because that\u2019s how life is,\u201d says Blacque. To help viewers keep track of the juggling storylines, Bochco and Hoblit chose Blacque to say \u201cPreviously on Hill Street Blues\u201d over clips of the previous week\u2019s show (\u201cthey liked my melodic voice,\u201d Blacque says), something countless series have copied since. </p> <p> The ratings were \u201cjust abysmal\u201d, Bochco recalls. Network executives frantically switched the show\u2019s time-slot, which made matters worse. \u201cThe 11 people who were loyally watching us could barely find us.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crZZ1HW2oPU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/crZZ1HW2oPU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Thomas says the crew started wearing black armbands, certain the show\u2019s demise was imminent. And Warren says, \u201cmy most vivid memory is <a href=\"http://parade.com/287265/nancyberk/showbiz-analysis-with-charles-haid/\">Charlie Haid</a> sitting in roll call drawing a cartoon of a rocket ship that said HSB on the side \u2013 it launched and then came all the way back down.\u201d (Haid adds, with a laugh, \u201cthe rocket was crashing down on Mike\u2019s house and his poor little children.\u201d)</p> <p> Sikking recalls everybody scrambling to call their agents to line up their next gig \u2013 he was calm because he was heading for London to do theater. The actors say their cause was aided by the fact that what audience did tune in was educated and upscale \u2013 and attracted high-end advertisers. \u201cIt was the first time I heard the word demographics,\u201d Sikking says. </p> <p> But Hoblit says what really saved the show was that the rest of NBC\u2019s lineup couldn\u2019t get arrested either: \u201cWe were dumb lucky that NBC was doing so poorly and had nothing to replace us with.\u201d </p> <p> NBC executives Fred Silverman and Brandon Tartikoff loved Hill Street Blues and before Silverman lost his job he renewed the show, albeit for a half-season order. It was the lowest-rated scripted series ever to be brought back. In Bochco\u2019s new memoir, <a href=\"https://www.ket.org/episode/BLBK%20%20001622/\">Truth is a Total Defense</a>, he says Silverman even wrote him a note declaring, \u201cHill Street Blues is going to sweep the Emmys and go on to become a big hit.\u201d</p> <p> Still, everyone was shocked when 21 Emmy nominations poured in, including eight for acting, three for directing and two for writing. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it, it was almost silly,\u201d Sikking says.</p> <p> Thomas says her first reaction to being nominated for best supporting actress was \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with people?\u201d but adds that \u201con a personal level it meant a lot because my dad was dying of cancer so he was very happy at the thought I might have a career.\u201d</p> <p> Suddenly, Bochco says, \u201cour phones were ringing off the hook\u201d with interview requests. Still, he doubted the show would win anything. \u201cNobody was watching us because our show was so startlingly different and the voting pool, like with the Oscars, was mostly older people.\u201d</p> <p> He was wrong. That night, America heard that Mike Post theme eight times, including during the award for outstanding actor (<a href=\"http://markdeutsch39.blogspot.com/2012/06/whatever-happened-to-daniel-j-travanti.html\">Daniel J Travanti</a>), outstanding actress (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iyXjT9LHg0\">Barbara Babcock</a>), outstanding supporting actor (<a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-05-12/features/8702050132_1_ray-calletano-grace-gardner-michael-conrad\">Michael Conrad</a>), outstanding writing, outstanding directing and outstanding drama. \u201cEvery time they said, \u2018And the winner is\u2019, it was Hill Street Blues,\u201d Blacque says. </p> <p> Every time, TV viewers could hear and see a boisterous band of \u201cmutts\u201d on their feet cheering. \u201cWe just went through the roof,\u201d Blacque says. </p> <p> \u201cWe went nuts and were very rude,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cWe felt like it was our party.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53ICH3yms-Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/53ICH3yms-Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Spano says they were the antithesis of the <a href=\"http://www.vincelombardi.com/\">Vince Lombardi </a>quote about getting to the end zone and acting like you\u2019ve been there before. \u201cIt was my first rodeo,\u201d he says. \u201cI was extremely gauche but we were not being show-offy, we were just so surprised and pleased. We were childish in the best way.\u201d</p> <p> Haid says the crowd started to turn on them a bit and Bochco says, \u201cthe producer of the Emmys barked at me about their unruliness.\u201d (In his memoir, Bochco also recounts accidentally stabbing himself in the thigh with his trophy, drawing blood.)</p> <p> Weitz adds, \u201cSomeone said to me, \u2018Do you have to be that vocal every time\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes, why would we hold it in?\u2019\u201d </p> <p> The next day it was back to work but Weitz felt the eight trophies (one of which was snuck into the background of a scene), \u201censured our future\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cWe went in that Monday with such a sense of pride,\u201d Warren says. \u201cWe were the little engine that could. We felt the awards were an indication we were right about what we were trying to do. Now maybe America would tune in.\u201d </p> <p> Bochco wasn\u2019t as confident that the Emmys would have such an impact until the season premiere the next month. </p> <p> \u201cOur numbers did change dramatically,\u201d Thomas says. </p> <p> Hill Street began winning its time slot and even briefly cracked the top 10 in ratings. Although it never ultimately finished a season even in the top 20, it gained enough stature and enough of an audience, Bochco says, that \u201cwe were being universally lauded as a game changer and that\u2019s pretty heady stuff\u201d.</p> <p> Ed Marinaro (officer <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/31627/8-television-characters-who-were-supposed-die-%E2%80%A6-didn%E2%80%99t\">Joe Coffey</a>) says they were \u201chaving a great time on the show but it was hard to process what was happening \u2013 you couldn\u2019t appreciate then what our legacy would be. But we did change the way people watched television.\u201d</p> <p> Suddenly, television was populated by dramas such as <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2012/10/12/st-elsewhere-reunion-snow-globe\">St Elsewhere</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jun/11/cagney-and-lacey-box-set\">Cagney and Lacey</a>, which may not have happened had Hill Street been canceled. \u201cWe changed the landscape irrevocably,\u201d Hoblit recalls. \u201cI look at it as a miracle now.\u201d</p> <p> Hill Street won four consecutive outstanding drama awards, along with numerous other acting, writing and directing trophies. (\u201cWe made history the next year with all five outstanding supporting actor nominations,\u201d Blacque adds.)</p> <p> Guest appearances gave a boost to actors including Tim Robbins, Forest Whitaker, Danny Glover and Dan Hedaya. </p> <p>And, of course, the cast and creative team benefited enormously. The show\u2019s writers went on to create <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/10/miami-vice-box-set\">Miami Vice</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/law-order?nbc=1\">Law &amp; Order </a>and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/twin-peaks\"> Twin Peaks</a> \u2013 shows with seemingly little in common. \u201cThe show had so many different kinds of influence but the freedom to experiment was the same for all of us,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/david-milch-made-100m-gambled-866184\">David Milch</a>, who joined the series in the third season and later co-created NYPD Blue and created Deadwood. \u201cThe experience of Hill Street taught us what it meant to grab your balls and jump.\u201d</p> <p> The veracity and complexity Hill Street brought to TV dramas can be seen in shows ranging from The Wire to The Americans. But the original can still hold its own. Blacque says he still watches Hill Street Blues in reruns. \u201cWe were really good,\u201d he says, and adds with a laugh, \u201cand we were really young.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Presidential campaigns drain away life in many ways. When Bernie Sanders finally returned home to Vermont this summer, after 15 months flying the country in search of the Democratic nomination, a long-abandoned family car had to be jump-started by his wife, Jane. The general election trail is longer still, and it is not just batteries that are running flat.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-obama-birth-certificate-clinton\">Trump admits Obama was born in US \u2013 but falsely pins conspiracy on Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Faster than ever, the miles and fatigue are accumulating. When Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">fell ill last Sunday</a>, at a memorial for 9/11 victims in New York, she was on day 518 of an almost non-stop campaign. Despite all predictions of a \u201ccoronation\u201d, that campaign has segued seamlessly from a tougher-than-expected primary fight against Sanders to a battle against Donald Trump that she calls \u201cthe most consequential vote of our lifetimes\u201d.</p> <p>Although Clinton, a former globe-trotting secretary of state, claims a four-day rest has cured the allergy-induced pneumonia which caused her legs to buckle, she remains on a 10-day course of the antibiotic Levaquin and faces more than 5,000 miles of travel and debate prep in the next week alone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances,\u201d Clinton confided to students on Thursday, as campaign aides watched nervously from the sidelines of a rally in North Carolina. \u201cBut with just two months to go until election day? Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.\u201d</p> <p>One challenge is that many more states are in play than usual. In 1960, Richard Nixon was deemed foolish for promising to visit all 50. Since then, candidates have tended to concentrate on a handful of genuinely competitive battlegrounds \u2013 with just brief fundraising forays to rich coastal donors to interrupt an otherwise intense focus on Middle America\u2019s swing voters.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s appeal to blue-collar Democrats (and rejection by more educated Republicans) has added places like Michigan and Arizona to the list that may determine who gets to sit in the Oval Office. Opinion polls suggest the national race is on a knife-edge.</p> <p>The vast distances of a politically-fractured US are exacerbated by a desire among both candidates to head home to New York each night, to sleep in their own beds wherever possible. Though Clinton has a house in Washington DC, she prefers to point her Boeing 737 toward the leafy suburb of Chappaqua, then return to nearby Westchester airport each morning.</p> <p>Even Trump, whose Boeing 757-200 is configured for just 43 passengers and has a silk-lined master bedroom to go with his gold taps, favours leaving \u201cTrump Force One\u201d at Teterboro airport in New Jersey and sleeping in his Manhattan tower.</p> <p>Neither campaign jet can match the logistical polish provided to the victor. The president\u2019s fleet of planes and helicopters provides a near frictionless ability to stroll from the Resolute desk and be in the air, surrounded by an array of modern communications, within minutes. Aboard Air Force One, there is a Zen-like calm that feels very different to the chaos of a campaign plane.</p> <p>While Trump occasionally shows off by buzzing crowds with his helicopter, the reality of daily commuting for both candidates is a cumbersome secret service convoy shuttling them from private airport terminals to college gymnasiums and conference arenas, a nauseating blur of identikit rallies.</p> <p>One handicap they do increasingly share with the commander-in-chief is the almost constant presence of cameras. Faced with criticism about hiding from the press, both candidates recently agreed to let journalists travel on their planes.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s enlarged jet was quickly littered with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-campaign-plane.html?_r=0\">banana peels, monogramed cocktail napkins and power cords</a>; Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/donald-trump-campaign-ohio-fair-plane-media\">white leather chairs and polished woodwork were marred</a> by the sight of reporters shuttling back and forth to a separate cabin, because they could not sit on the floor during take-off.</p> <p>This is the real reason why both candidates add to grueling itineraries by flying back to the east coast most nights. Even though, or perhaps because, they are surrounded by dozens of burly secret service agents at all times, there is a little privacy on the trail.</p> <p>Hotel floors tend to be block-booked, but that only increases the difficulty of avoiding awkward encounters with staff. Though Clinton hid her pneumonia from all but the closest of confidants, a slew of others inside the bubble later revealed that they too had been hit by an epidemic of exhaustion-related viruses.</p> <p>Explaining her reluctance to allow a \u201cprotective pool\u201d \u2013 reporters who follow candidates and presidents wherever they go \u2013 Clinton told aides she wanted to preserve the ability to \u201cgo out for ice cream in the middle of the night\u201d without scrambling the press vans.</p> <p>Yet spontaneity is an undoubted casualty of life already. \u201cLike a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare. I sweat the details,\u201d Clinton said on Thursday. \u201cFrom now until 8 November, everywhere I go, I\u2019m going to talk about my ideas for our country\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/clinton-taco-truck-delicious-donald-trump-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53ahx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2724004\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton: 'A taco truck on every corner sounds delicious' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dc017ce4b0df02df202e3f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916clintontaco_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572819&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572819&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/clinton-taco-truck-delicious-donald-trump-video\">Hillary Clinton: \u2018A taco truck on every corner sounds delicious\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A vast army of \u201cadvance\u201d staff is expected to co-ordinate every detail of candidates\u2019 public appearances, in case something goes wrong in an election so tight.

Only a shift in attitude, harsher penalties and better enforcement will improve matters,\u201d he said.</p> <p>RAC research based on a survey of 1,714 UK motorists and published earlier this week shows that illegal mobile phone use is on the rise. Thirty-one percent of motorists admitted to using a handheld phone behind the wheel, compared with just 8% in 2014.</p> <p>The proportion of drivers who confessed to sending a message or posting on social media rose from 7% to 19% over the same period, and 14% owned up to taking photographs or videos with their phone while driving.</p> <p>The RAC believes a 27% fall in the number of full-time officers dedicated to roads policing in England and Wales, excluding London, between 2010 and 2015 has left drivers with no fear that they will be caught for offences that are not detected by automatic cameras.</p>",

Meetings between these clubs tend to produce thrills, drama, and enough talking points to keep chins wagging as furiously as Diego Costa\u2019s finger. From a lesson for \u201cwee cocky southern buggers\u201d to a ghost goal and a historic slip, something extraordinary always seems to happen when these two get together and if you don\u2019t believe us, then check out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/29/chelsea-liverpool-field-notes-rivalry\">this wonderful little guide by Scott Murray</a>. It\u2019ll be a surprise if two stylish teams packed with (and managed by) characters straight out of vaudeville do not add to that rich history today. And Chelsea will go top of the league if they win. Liverpool also have serious title ambitions. This match is both teams\u2019 biggest test of the season so far.</p> <p> Liverpool have already scored four goals at Arsenal this season, should have scored four at Tottenham and could score four at Chelsea. They attack in rapid bursts that can bedazzle even the best defenders, a description that sometimes applies to David Luiz. The Brazilian is expected to make his second Chelsea debut tonight in the absence of John Terry, and Liverpool will be sure to try to rattle him bearing in mind that two years in Paris have not made him any less prone to sudden lapses of reason: in his last match for PSG, just last month, he conceded a penalty by performing a WWE move on a Monaco forward. There\u2019s no telling how he\u2019ll react to Sadio Man\u00e9 &amp; Co rushing him.</p> <p> But there\u2019s more than a suspicion of vulnerability to Liverpool\u2019s defence, too, and no better man than Costa to find out whether Joel Matip is really as cool as he has appeared in his first few outings in England. What is more, you can be sure that the shrewd tactician Antonio Conte will have devised a ploy for exploiting uncertainty in Liverpool\u2019s left-back area. Such as getting Willian or Eden Hazard to attack it: yeah, it doesn\u2019t necessarily take anything complicated to get behind this Liverpool defence. Meanwhile in midfield, a zone that Liverpool tend to treat like those yellow boxes on English roads \u2013 somewhere to travel through without dawdling \u2013 much will depend on the extent to which N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 can disrupt Liverpool\u2019s flow and give Chelsea a platform. In short, there\u2019s intrigue all over the pitch in a match that will teach us a lot about each of these teams. We\u2019ll bring you the full lineups as soon as they\u2019re available: in the meantime, best stock up on popcorn and suds. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T17:29:42.151Z\">at 6.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57dbbf52e4b067ad300884f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T09:47:40.018Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Teams:</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Chelsea</strong>: Courtois; Ivanovic, Cahill, David Luiz, Azpilicueta; Kant\u00e9; Willian, Oscar, Matic, Hazard; Costa.</p> <p><em><strong>Subs</strong>: Begovic, Aina, Marcos Alonso, Fabregas, Pedro, Moses, Batshuayi</em></p> <p><strong>Liverpool</strong>: Mignolet; Clyne, Matip, Lovren, Milner; Henderson, Wijnaldum, Lallana; Coutinho, Man\u00e9, Sturridge</p> <p><em><strong> Subs</strong>: Karius, Lucas, Stewart, Origi, Moreno, Grujic, Ejaria</em></p> <p><strong>Referee</strong>: M Atkinson</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T18:41:16.745Z\">at 7.41pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>In the last hour our small team has received two phone calls from tenants desperate for help. One is a young mother of two children exasperated because she has been without any hot water for three weeks and the second is a tenant with water pouring into the bedroom every time it rains. In both cases their landlords refuse to do anything about it - and this is far from an exception.</p> <p>As an environmental health officer, I work for a district council to uphold the health and safety of tenants in both private and social housing. Every day, frustrated and angry renters rely on us to step in and help. The demand for our help has increased substantially, but we face continual cuts. We have to make hard decisions about who to visit, because we simply don\u2019t have enough people. And it\u2019s worse from October and March, when the colder weather leads to a significant rise in complaints of cold, damp and mould.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/sep/03/council-housing-benefits-landlord-dwp-rent\">I want to help you get the right benefits, but your landlord is taking up all my time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My team should be growing to meet this demand, not shrinking. The shortage of social housing means many families with young children now have no choice but to rent privately. In the past 10 years the private rented sector has grown by 120% in my area \u2013 and one in three of these properties carry potential health risks. Poor maintenance is a common problem, leading to accidents, while cold and damp can both cause and worsen circulatory and respiratory conditions. I worry about how many young children will develop preventable, life-long respiratory conditions such as asthma this winter, which will prove costly to the NHS over their lifetime.</p> <p>Many new landlords seem shocked when inspectors like me have the audacity to ask them to spend money making the property safe. There are now many such new landlords in the private rented sector who have been tempted by the \u201ceasy\u201d money to be made, but who have little or no knowledge or understanding of their legal responsibilities. </p> <p>As funding cuts bite further, more landlords will recognise the chance to get away with doing less than the bare minimum. Only this week two landlords admitted that they knew what they needed to do to their properties, but were waiting to be told by us to make improvements. Officers like me are increasingly frustrated at not being able to help the people who need it most. </p> <p>Most of the tenants calling on our help live in solid brick houses that in our area are cheaper to rent but expensive to heat. I inspected a terrace property the other day where the tenant was putting a crippling \u00a3300 on their electric meter every month as well as falling well behind on their rent. <br></p> <p>Worse still, we know that many tenants who have the audacity to complain to the council will instantly be given their notice by the landlord and told to leave, whether the complaint is justified or not. </p> <p>Changes in the law have been made, but it is unlikely to encourage tenants to call us. The fear of the consequences will remain for a long time to come. Just one recent example was the tenant who had asked us for support to get improvements and as a result found his possessions out on the street. <br></p> <p>You might well ask why we don\u2019t prosecute more landlords who break the law, but prosecutions consume considerable resources that just don\u2019t exist. And even when our prosecutions are successful, often they only result in very small fines. We have prosecuted landlords and will continue to do so, but the risk of being caught and levels of fines are not the deterrent that they should be.<br></p> <p>With all the cuts and staff shortages, I just hope there are enough of us left to help when you or your family need us most.</p> <p><em>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/series/public-servant-my-letter-to-the-public\">series</a> aims to give a voice to the staff behind the public services that are hit by mounting cuts and rising demand, and so often denigrated by the press, politicians and public.

  "<p>Halfway through my interview with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, Laura Alvarez, his wife, turns up with a pot of homemade blackberry and apple jam for one of his assistants. \u201cIt\u2019s from the allotment,\u201d Corbyn says proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a balance in life. I know my office gets quite irritated because I read lots of other things. I think you have to have an understanding of other things in life, not just the immediacy of politics.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re in a cafe in London\u2019s Finsbury Park, a short walk from Corbyn\u2019s home and in the constituency he has represented for 23 years. His voice is quiet, deep and even, a baritone with limited range. It\u2019s amazing he\u2019s not hoarse. In the past week, he has held two rallies in London and one in Essex, before a short tour of Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee).</p> <p>He arrives 20 minutes late, having just been at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/nottinghillcarnival\">Notting Hill carnival</a> children\u2019s day. I ask what he\u2019s reading now. \u201cA history of Iceland. I didn\u2019t know much about Iceland,\u201d he concedes, but after a public interview he did with the novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-okri\">Ben Okri</a> this summer, he was handed a great stack of tomes and has been going through them. \u201cIt\u2019s an old book about the lores of Iceland, and its development on Danish-based Christianity, and the levels of slavery and indebtedness of small farmers in Iceland. I\u2019ve only got 100 pages in, so we\u2019re around the late 18th century.\u201d</p> <p>Politicians usually confect answers about their cultural input to suggest some untapped creativity, or a hip alter ego. Often the plan unravels. In 2006 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/24/uk.arts\">Gordon Brown said he loved the Arctic Monkeys</a>, only to prove incapable of naming a single song. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/18/popandrock.politicsandthearts\">David Cameron claimed the Jam\u2019s Eton Rifles was his favourite song</a>, only to have Paul Weller retort, \u201cWhich part of it didn\u2019t he get? It wasn\u2019t intended as a fucking jolly drinking song for the cadet corps.\u201d</p> <p>But, for better or worse, Corbyn isn\u2019t like other politicians. He might have said he was reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elena-ferrante\">Elena Ferrante</a>\u2019s novels, to suggest he was in touch with his feminine side, or a book of world war two poetry to connect with older voters (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> has an enormous 105-point lead in favourability among the UK\u2019s eldest voters). Instead, Corbyn just tells you what he\u2019s actually reading. If it sounds weird or boring or both, so be it. He couldn\u2019t be less calculated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Communication is everything. Could we do things differently? Probably. It\u2019s something I want to develop</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given the performative element to modern political leadership, this does, of course, present a potential liability. Asked if he would use nuclear weapons, Corbyn has said simply: \u201cNo.\u201d (He might have said: \u201cThe whole point is that if you have them you\u2019ll never use them, but I think the money would be better spent elsewhere.\u201d) Asked before the referendum how passionate he was about the EU on a scale of one to 10, he said, \u201cSeven, seven and a half.\u201d (He might have said: \u201cMy passion for staying in is a 10. But there are things we can and should improve.\u201d) The problem, his critics say, isn\u2019t just that he won\u2019t play the game; it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t even know the rules.</p> <p>For many of his supporters, this is part of the appeal. They are fed up with the game. For them, his ability to speak his mind unselfconsciously, to be guided by conviction rather than pollsters and spin doctors, gives him an air of authenticity they feel has been lost. Last month I watched Corbyn address a packed auditorium in Chelmsford. \u201cI love acting,\u201d he told the crowd, to laughter and applause. \u201cThat\u2019s why I go to the theatre, because I really enjoy drama. But when I\u2019m in parliament I want to see political representation on behalf of ordinary people, not drama.\u201d</p> <p>Over a cup of tea a few days later, I ask if he entirely rejects the notion that there are certain ways a leader has to perform. \u201cI don\u2019t reject it outright. I\u2019m trying to remould it, because communication is everything. If you can\u2019t communicate your views, you\u2019re not getting anywhere. Could we do things differently? Probably. It\u2019s something I want to develop.\u201d</p> <p>But he is confident when connecting with voters on a personal level. As we walk through his constituency, he chats to a kebab shop owner he knows by name. A few minutes later, he is confronted by a young man on the street.</p> <p>\u201cYo! Corbyn, man. Why you pull us out the EU?\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn stops. \u201cI didn\u2019t, actually. I wanted to stay in and reform it. I think there were some problems with it, but I wanted to stay in and fix them.\u201d</p> <p>A little further on, another man approaches. He\u2019s a musician and remembers a time when Corbyn advocated for his band. The area is gentrifying and space is tight; Corbyn helped negotiate with a local landlord to make a room available for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71d1e1b38e6effc332ac2a0c05c7c893b08e959a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d1e1b38e6effc332ac2a0c05c7c893b08e959a/0_84_1647_988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn with Angela Eagle and Andy Burnham in the House of Commons in February\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Angela Eagle and Andy Burnham in the House of Commons in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pixel8000</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The public is something Corbyn clearly feels a part of, not a place he goes for votes and events. \u201cI\u2019m very keen on not spending all my time in Westminster,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are any number of meetings you can endlessly have, so I have quite a tough rule that, from Thursday onwards, I\u2019m around the country. And at least one full day a week, I\u2019m here in the constituency. I\u2019ve observed many Labour MPs and leaders over the years who, without really thinking about it, become cut off. You are offered all sorts of opportunities to be separate from the rest of the population, and it can all be very enticing and quite nice. But in reality, it can be very dangerous, because you can be completely removed from the people who put you there in the first place. It\u2019s not an easy balance.\u201d</p> <p>He has found the shift in pace and profile over the past year a challenge. \u201cYou suddenly realise you\u2019re under scrutiny the whole time. You find yourself being cautious about random conversations on the street, because you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going.\u201d Pointing to Alvarez, he says: \u201cWe were in Fort William, having two days off, eating chips in a restaurant, and suddenly it appears in the Sunday Times.\u201d What was the story? \u201cThat I was having chips in a restaurant in Fort William!\u201d He laughs. \u201cAs though I was not somehow doing my job properly.\u201d</p> <p>But this is still the part of the job Corbyn does well, meeting supporters and constituents: he has an easy, unaffected manner that escapes many politicians. Of all the gaffes there have been and will, no doubt, continue to be, Corbyn seems unlikely to ensnare himself in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-transcript\">Gillian Duffy \u201cbigoted woman\u201d</a> moment. He does retail politics well: one person, one conversation, one handshake. The bigger issue is whether he can do wholesale.</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5950a1857e99e5c0fcbd7d4920a95a352ebfc497\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5950a1857e99e5c0fcbd7d4920a95a352ebfc497/188_348_3849_4410/873.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"873\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clearly Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s appeal goes beyond Finsbury Park. Over the past couple of months, I have attended three leadership campaign meetings. This year\u2019s events have been bigger than the last. There were a thousand at the Hilton in Brighton, with a further 500 outside whom Corbyn addressed in the drizzle; a capacity crowd of around 500 in Chelmsford civic theatre, a town that has had a Tory MP since 1950; a similar number in the Caird Hall complex in Dundee, where Labour has been eclipsed by the SNP.</p> <p>Meetings aren\u2019t movements. Nor are they necessarily indicators of potential electoral success. But they are not nothing, either. Across the western world, membership of political parties, interest in politics in general and voter turnout in particular are in decline. So when a man rejected by almost all his parliamentary colleagues, leading a party that last year suffered its second election defeat in a row, is packing out venues across the country, it\u2019s noteworthy.</p> <p>These big meetings are where Corbyn draws much of his political energy. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unprecedented,\u201d he tells me when we meet in London. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened in my lifetime and I\u2019ve been in the Labour party since I was 16. And they are not all Labour supporters. In Cornwall, we did a headcount and only half were, but they came \u2013 so there is an appeal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The PLP don\u2019t want Corbyn to succeed. I was loyal through Brown and Blair. Why can\u2019t they be loyal through this?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These are campaign rallies only in the loosest sense of the word. From the stage, people are asked to join the phone bank; some come wearing Corbyn T-shirts. But in the rallies I went to, the Labour leader never once asked for anyone\u2019s vote. Of more than a dozen speakers, only one, in Dundee \u2013 who gave a laundry list as to why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith\">Owen Smith</a> was unsuitable to lead a progressive movement \u2013 raised the subject of Corbyn\u2019s challenger. Nobody I interviewed in the audience mentioned Smith, either. It wasn\u2019t that they were studiously refusing to talk about him; he just wasn\u2019t on their radar.</p> <p>At least one speaker will point out, more in sorrow than in anger, that they had a meeting just like this last year to elect Corbyn; now they have to do it again. His supporters tell me how disappointed they are that the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) cannot accept the decision, and complain about the way the media has treated him. \u201cThe PLP don\u2019t want him to succeed,\u201d says Anne Pissaridou, a Labour member all her life and until recently a local councillor in Brighton; she lost her seat to the Tories by a couple of hundred votes last year. \u201cI stuck it out through Brown and Blair, and was loyal. I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t be loyal through this.\u201d</p> <p>Each rally has its own flavour. In Brighton, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/labour-suspends-brighton-branch-amid-accusations-of-improper-ballot\">the local party was suspended</a> in July over allegations of abusive behaviour and an improper ballot (those at the rally insist the only thing irregular about the ballot was that so many people turned up, they couldn\u2019t fit them all into the venue), they dwell on democracy; in Chelmsford, the audience cheer a demand for a better rural bus service; in Dundee, a speaker warns of the perils of nationalism north and south of the border.</p> <p>But while Corbyn\u2019s speech varies slightly, his role is always the same. He is introduced to a standing ovation. Dressed in slacks, tieless shirt and sandals I assumed were Clarks, but Alvarez tells me are from Mexico, Corbyn has the beard of a professor and the pate of a friar. Bookish and ascetic, aesthetically and stylistically he owes more to Labour\u2019s methodist wing than to its union origins.</p> <p>Oratory is not Corbyn\u2019s strong suit; he employs not a single metaphor. His voice rises and falls to its own logic, but its cadence seems to bear little relation to what he is saying. He often emphasises the word <em>is</em>, as though the verb <em>to be</em> is his point: \u201cHousing <em>is</em> the most important issue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14b52105844cb0bfc7f1264f76c465ae612716e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14b52105844cb0bfc7f1264f76c465ae612716e9/0_135_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn supporters at a leadership rally in London in August\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters at a leadership rally in London in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By this stage in the campaign, he has spoken at more than 30 rallies, giving more or less the same speech. You\u2019d think he\u2019d have it down by now, but he fluffs his lines a few times every night. There are awkward moments where the crowd aren\u2019t sure if he\u2019s finished his point, or is about to move on, and will either clap in the wrong place or watch him end his point in silence. Still, when he finishes there is another standing ovation. People have not come to be entertained; they have come to be reassured that the language of public ownership, redistribution, of caring and support, has not been retired from the public sphere: to have a basic sense of decency reflected back to them through their politics.</p> <p>His supporters have been derided as \u201cCorbynistas\u201d, conjuring the image of pamphleteers and paper-sellers, ideologues and didacts \u2013 unbiddable devotees to Jude the Apostle, the patron saint of lost causes. But while there is a hard core of fanatics on social media, one struggles to find an archetypal \u201cCorbynista\u201d at any of these rallies. The people I spoke to were far more varied and less easy to caricature. There was the self-employed craftswoman who voted for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham\">Andy Burnham</a> in the last leadership election; Pissaridou, who voted for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/yvette-cooper\">Yvette Cooper</a> (\u201cI was torn, but I regretted it. I think he has the policies we\u2019ve wanted for a long time\u201d); and Simon, the Dundee brewer who backed the SNP at the last general election. \u201cIf Corbyn had been leader, I would have voted Labour,\u201d he says. \u201cI still don\u2019t think Labour stands a chance in Scotland at the moment. But they could do eventually, with someone like him.\u201d Others in Dundee felt that the lure of the SNP would soon fade.</p> <p>Some, like James Ellis, a former Green member in Brighton, joined Labour after the general election in 2015. \u201cLabour was opening up,\u201d he says, \u201cand I needed to be in it, so I was really happy when Jeremy decided to stand.\u201d Others, like Bruce Whitehead, a former journalist and freelance musician from Edinburgh, joined Labour from the small hard left party <a href=\"http://leftunity.org/\">Left Unity</a>, the day after Corbyn won the leadership. (The day after I spoke to him, Whitehead received a message from the Labour party that he would be purged, citing social media insisting he is still a member of Left Unity; he is appealing.)</p> <p>Everyone has their own wishlist of what they want Corbyn to do with his mandate. \u201cI\u2019d like him to articulate a simple, concise vision that will attract people who aren\u2019t political nerds like me,\u201d Pissaridou says. \u201cHe needs to speak to those 52% of people who voted for Brexit,\u201d Ellis says. Emerging from Corbyn\u2019s rally in Dundee, Danny McDonald was disappointed that he hadn\u2019t given a clearer idea of how he\u2019d fund his policies.</p> <p>The rallies may be big, but ideologically they are tame. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> was running for the Democratic nomination in the US, he railed against billionaires, bankers and corporations. Corbyn talks about renationalising the railways, building more houses and reaching out to people with mental health problems. There is no talk of neoliberal globalisation, quoting of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antonio-Gramsci\">Gramsci</a>, or appeals for intersectional thinking. In Dundee, a band sang the Internationale and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwbzxemJZIc\">There Is Power In A Union</a>, and socialism was mentioned several times. That was as radical as it got. In Chelmsford, Anna Wallbank, a primary school teacher, told me: \u201cIf someone better came along, I\u2019d vote for them.\u201d</p> <p>***</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People said: \u2018You must make plans for when you win.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Don\u2019t talk about it.\u2019 I thought it was tempting fate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Jeremy Corbyn decided to stand as leader in summer 2015, he didn\u2019t think he would win. Indeed, the fear was that his defeat would reveal just how small the left in the party really was. Older leftwing candidates such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell\">John McDonnell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-abbott\">Diane Abbott</a> had already stood, while younger MPs were considered too inexperienced. He was an accidental candidate.</p> <p>\u201cEverything sort of took off,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was straight into hustings. Like, the next day. And that week I was on the road travelling. We didn\u2019t have a campaign. We didn\u2019t have an organisation. We didn\u2019t have any money. All we had was my credit card. That lasted about a week. Then we started raising money. We got a loan from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite\">Unite</a>. John McDonnell took over as chair of the campaign. Then we started appointing people and getting a campaign together. Time for reflection was very limited because from the moment I was nominated I was on a train.\u201d</p> <p>More unions came on board. The rallies got bigger. The polling numbers soared. What had been unthinkable became first possible, then likely and finally inevitable. But for all the energy and endorsements, one of the last people to realise Corbyn might win was Corbyn himself. \u201cI was still not convinced by the end of August. I would go into the office and they would say: \u2018Look, Jeremy, you have to make plans for when you win.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019m not even going there. Please don\u2019t talk about it.\u2019 I thought it was tempting fate.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone who thinks the year that followed has been about the failings and foibles of one man simply hasn\u2019t been paying attention. Corbyn emerged from a volatile and fractured political moment, both nationally and globally, a moment accentuated by the financial crisis. In Britain, scandals over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">phone hacking</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/mps-expenses\">MPs\u2019 expenses</a> and Operation Yewtree and its consequences have left many disaffected with both the political and media establishments. Meanwhile, there is a generation that has known only austerity and war, and has a future of debt and work insecurity to look forward to. Throughout the western world, mainstream parties on left and right have lost influence as they drift to the centre, leaving space at the margins for more populist challengers.</p> <p>\u201cI feel the world as stranger to me than I ever felt before,\u201d said the renowned academic, Stuart Hall in 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s when everyone is operating in so many of the same parameters that the only debate you can have is a sort of Swiftian debate - you know, shall we eat the children now or later?\u201d</p> <p>Few people foresaw Corbyn\u2019s victory. Nobody could have guessed that a range of disparate movements around war, feminism, education, inequality would converge on the Labour party. Nobody could have guessed that this would be the moment when New Labour would lose not only its ideological appeal, but plausible advocates to carry its project forward. Nobody could have guessed that one of the least charismatic, most diffident figures of the British left would emerge as the standard-bearer for a new kind of politics, at 66. His ascendancy did not prompt a crisis in the Labour party; it illustrated it.</p> <p>Since establishments do not, by definition, radicalise themselves, Corbyn needed a plan to make his leadership work. It soon became clear he didn\u2019t have one. And since insurrectionaries don\u2019t easily give up the power they have acquired, his opponents needed a plan to remove him. It has taken the best part of a year to become clear they didn\u2019t have one, either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7be0333cb6bb954037da6724491ad9624790733\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7be0333cb6bb954037da6724491ad9624790733/0_10_2082_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn with David Cameron at the state opening of parliament in May 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With David Cameron at the state opening of parliament in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, for the last year Corbyn has been a political pi\u00f1ata, whacked mercilessly from all sides. Mauled by the press, maligned by his own MPs, ridiculed by the government, he has lurched from crisis to crisis and challenge to challenge, with coup threats and mass resignations alongside accusations of bullying, antisemitism and sexism.</p> <p>Corbyn insists he will do everything in his power to ensure a climate of intimidation and exclusion does not dominate. \u201cI don\u2019t do abuse, I don\u2019t do bullying and I won\u2019t tolerate it from anyone associated with my teams, supporters or anyone else,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to say to everyone in the Labour party that this is a safe place to be. I don\u2019t accept any kind of abuse or intimidation, misogyny, homophobia, racism, antisemitism or Islamophobia, and we are taking action against it as a party.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Corbyn\u2019s team feel he is being held to a different standard, pointing to how little interest the press shows in exposing racism within Tory party ranks, for example.</p> <p>But the anticipated debacle prompted by Corbyn\u2019s leadership has yet to materialise. Labour has won all four of the byelections held since he was elected, upping its share of the vote in three and dipping by just 0.3% in the other. In mayoral elections, Labour has won Bristol and London, key cities it had previously lost; in local elections, it has outpolled the Tories and retained control of key bellwether towns such as Nuneaton and Stevenage. In a poll taken shortly before the EU referendum, Labour was even with the Tories.</p> <p>But the PLP\u2019s vote of no confidence and subsequent leadership challenge, just as the Tories dusted themselves off and elected a new prime minister, have had an impact. In the most recent YouGov poll, Labour are 14 points behind. A poll last month put the new prime minister\u2019s net favourability rating at +33.6 and Corbyn\u2019s at -30.7. Given the pollsters\u2019 failure to predict the last election, his own election and Brexit, Corbyn can be forgiven for not putting too much store by such figures. Nonetheless, he has a steep hill to climb.</p> <p>Not all of the parliamentary party was rooting for him to fail. Some members, while sceptical, were prepared to try to make it work. Many criticise not his policies but his leadership style. In a <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/labour-mp-any-other-job-jeremy-corbyn-would-have-faced-industrial-tribunal\">New Statesman article</a> last month, Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah claimed Corbyn had appointed her shadow minister for culture and the digital economy, then given half the job to Thangam Debbonaire, MP for Bristol West, without telling either of them \u2013 only to then give that portion back to Onwurah without telling Debbonaire. \u201cNo one knew what he wanted us to do,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf this had been any of my previous employers in the public and private sectors, Jeremy might well have found himself before an industrial tribunal.\u201d (Asked for comment, a Corbyn spokesperson responded: \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to have discussions about the delineation of these roles, but at no point was anybody sacked or singled out.\u201d)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/heidi-alexander\">Heidi Alexander</a>, former shadow minister for health, has written that she was \u201cexcited\u201d to be given that job and tried her best: \u201cA leader who had been willing to engage, support, take difficult decisions and able to build a team might have made it work. But we didn\u2019t have one, and in Jeremy Corbyn, as much as it pains me to say it, we never will.\u201d Alexander said she was repeatedly undermined by John McDonnell. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t good enough for the leader to routinely defer to his shadow chancellor when confronted with a difficult decision \u2013 a shadow chancellor who on three separate occasions undermined my efforts to agree collective positions on health matters.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Theresa May's education bill restricts access. Now she wants to repeal our human rights act. We have to be campaigning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But when I raise Alexander\u2019s complaints, Corbyn seems genuinely baffled. \u201cI was particularly surprised at Heidi\u2019s saying that, because Heidi and I had many discussions over the handling of the junior doctors\u2019 dispute, for example, and general health policy,\u201d he says. But you get the sense that the criticism doesn\u2019t come completely from left field. \u201cDid I defer to John McDonnell? John McDonnell is pretty clear in his views and setting them forward. I have an approach that is probably more [one] of listening and less declamatory. She took that as not showing leadership. I try to summarise conversations at the end of them and move on from there. And I hope Heidi will recognise that it\u2019s a style she might be misreading.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the infighting, Corbyn believes he has managed to shift the national conversation. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate what\u2019s happened in the past year,\u201d he says. \u201cI was elected in a very surprising set of circumstances, and we challenged fundamentally the economic agenda. Now [our] anti-austerity agenda is almost the norm. Everybody says, well, now you have to invest in the economy rather than cut. There\u2019s been a fundamental change and we will continue in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>How does he plan to do that? \u201cWe\u2019ll reach out and try to be as precise and campaigning as we can in policy areas,\u201d he says. \u201cTake housing policy. Building council housing, providing starter mortgages and regulating the private rented sector: that is something that has a lot of resonance beyond Labour voters. I will also be emphasising the contradictions in Theresa May, who stands on the steps of Downing Street like St Francis of Assisi, and then produces a higher education bill that further restricts access. Now she is proposing a British bill of rights which will repeal our human rights act.\u201d</p> <p>It is an interesting paradox that pugnacious politics should come in the form of such an unassertive man. When it comes to delivering memorable zingers against the Tories, Corbyn just doesn\u2019t have it in him. The issue isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t think quickly on his feet: it\u2019s that, even if he did, he wouldn\u2019t \u2013 he just thinks it\u2019s unhelpful.</p> <p>Does he plan to do prime minister\u2019s questions any differently if he wins? \u201cI find the traditional way of doing it completely off-putting. On one level, it can be quite funny. But it\u2019s remote from everybody\u2019s lives.\u201d Does he think his idea of crowdsourcing questions works? \u201cIt gets a very bad press from the Westminster media corps. Quite a lot of the parliamentary Labour party don\u2019t like it. But people I meet around the country quite frankly do like it. They say, you\u2019ve actually changed it in a good way. It makes more sense to us. So I\u2019ll develop it and work on it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a personally combative person,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have strong political views. I obviously do. But it\u2019s not my approach, which most people find frustrating. My supporters say, \u2018You should be tougher. You should sock it to \u2019em. Get heavy.\u2019 It\u2019s not my style. I have a point of view. I try to listen a lot, and to be a representative of those who don\u2019t feel represented.\u201d</p> <p>This frustrates some of his core supporters, too. A publisher friend told me about a boozy London dinner party with a group of leftwing stalwarts, including an academic, campaign organiser and film director. They went around the table giving Corbyn marks out of 10 for his performance so far. The lowest was two; the highest seven; the mean was around three. The only thing they were agreed on was that they would all vote for him again. Having laboured so long for a left insurgency within Labour, they didn\u2019t want to hand the reins back to the Blairites. They would like to see Corbyn translate the energy and optimism of his rallies into something more effective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"573d96ba76fc6cbb632e0f89a4c0c61540af1abb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/573d96ba76fc6cbb632e0f89a4c0c61540af1abb/164_101_3838_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn with Shami Chakrabarti in June 2016, at the launch of her report into antisemitism in Labour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Shami Chakrabarti in June, at the launch of her report into antisemitism in Labour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ideological divisions in the party may be deep, Corbyn says, but that should not preclude cooperation on a range of issues. \u201cRead the diaries of certain Labour cabinet ministers: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labourconference.labour\">Castle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/06/uk.iraq1\">Crossman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/22/tony-benn-peter-wilby-reads-diaries\">Benn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/07/politics-biography-chris-mullin\">Chris Mullin</a> and many others. All kinds of people manage to work together.

So it can be done. But it\u2019s also a question of how you take things forward. If we can be seen to be successfully attacking the Tories, as we did on academisation, then I think we will make a great deal of progress.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn has proposed investing \u00a3500bn in infrastructure and manufacturing, backed by a publicly owned national investment bank and regional banks. He wants to build at least half a million council houses, to introduce rent controls and a charter of private tenants\u2019 rights.</p> <p>What would he do differently if he had his year again? \u201cI would be better prepared for the media onslaught. I knew it was going to be difficult. But even I was surprised at the levels of refusal to engage, or to try to understand what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d</p> <p>If Corbyn is re-elected next week, as seems likely, the key question is: what will change? The PLP is the same; the media is the same; the party is the same. One would hope that his detractors have a more sophisticated plan than they did last year, in which they will engage with the meaning of Corbyn\u2019s victory, if not with him. But one would also hope that he has devised a way to get from where he is \u2013 popular in the party, unpopular in the country at large, unworkable in parliament \u2013 to where he wants to be.</p> <p>Corbyn says he plans to take the lead on issues such as housing and education, with policies he thinks most of the party can rally around. But if he leads, will the party follow? \u201cI\u2019ll be saying, in a kindly way, \u2018There is an awful lot we can campaign on together. If we do that, we\u2019re going to be effective. If we don\u2019t do that, we won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But will that be enough? \u201cIf Labour party members and supporters re-elect me, that will be a second mandate in a year. Respect for the mandate is about respect for democracy itself.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds as if he plans to appeal to MPs\u2019 better nature, even if he may have exhausted their goodwill. \u201cI\u2019m sure they all have better natures,\u201d Corbyn says, with an impish smile. \u201cI\u2019ll rely on the best natures that can come out. A lot of people say lots of things in the heat of the moment. But of course I\u2019ve made mistakes, and of course we need to do better. We certainly can\u2019t carry on as we did.</p> <p>\u201cI will put it to them that I\u2019ve got a mandate, if I\u2019m elected. I\u2019ll put it to them that the mandate is about the policies I\u2019m trying to put forward. Not every dot and comma and crossed T, or whatever. But it is the general direction of the economy and policy. And I\u2019ll invite them to work with us. Whether they\u2019re going to love me at the end of it?

  "<p>At 11.41am on Friday, Herman Mashaba, the new mayor of Johannesburg, sent an email to all the top officials of South Africa\u2019s sprawling, chaotic commercial capital.</p> <p>The tycoon, who took office in the city of 5 million people less than a month ago, ordered more visible policing, a clean-up campaign, repairs to roads and a dedicated civil servant to liaise with private property developers.</p> <p>\u201cIn the next few days, not weeks, you will see some big improvements in the city,\u201d the new mayor told the Guardian 20 minutes later during an interview in his downtown office.</p> <p>Such measures are hardly controversial. But Mashaba, a political novice who recently published a semi-autobiographical book called Capitalist Crusader and inveighed against a \u201cculture of dependency\u201d in South Africa, has much more ambitious plans. He wants to see a transformation of Johannesburg, and the country too, in line with his own unapologetically rightwing principles.</p> <p>\u201cI am against government trying to solve everything,\u201d Mashaba, 57, said. \u201cSociety deserves less government \u2026 As a democrat and a libertarian, I believe in freedom for everyone \u2026 I want human beings not to depend on government \u2026 As long as we don\u2019t adopt freedom policies we are not going to succeed. For any country to create wealth, you need individual freedom.\u201d</p> <p>The change of control in Johannesburg dealt a humiliating blow to the African National Congress, the celebrated anti-apartheid party once led by Nelson Mandela, which still holds power at national level. </p> <p>The Democratic Alliance (DA), which Mashaba joined two years ago, won or retained power in a string of major cities and in Johannesburg won 38% of the vote. With the support of the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters, it was enough to oust the ANC from city hall for the first time in the post-apartheid era. In its place came the DA, which has run Cape Town for a decade and has been branded a white, elitist movement by opponents, with politicians like Mashaba accused of being sellouts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/anc-elections-south-africa-democracy-zuma\">South Africa has broken the post-colonial narrative.

They have to be.

And angry purists on the left seem to hate people who think slightly differently more than they hate the other side.</p> <p>Third, and rather less obviously, the formal parties of the left \u2013 Labour, Lib Dems and Greens \u2013 have long since become bored by economics, forgetting that any winning platform must include a challenging recipe for creating prosperity.</p> <p>There never was a period in recent history when a better way of doing this was needed more, given that we are subservient to an economy devoted to funnelling money upwards to billionaires, from where it patently fails to trickle down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Angry purists on the left seem to hate people who think slightly differently more than they hate the other side</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet the left has abandoned this agenda to the right, concentrating instead \u2013 and rather patronisingly \u2013 on welfare. Another matter entirely.</p> <p>We might address one or possibly two of these barriers before the next general election, which we have to assume will take place in 2020, but the chances of tackling all three seem pretty remote.</p> <p>But don\u2019t let\u2019s give up.

We can also use our political institutions to make things happen.</p> <p>That sounds obvious, but it isn\u2019t. All too often the opportunities to reach out across party lines, to cooperate to change the law in parliament and beyond, get stymied because of obscure and irritating rivalries between opposition parties \u2013 and because their priorities and strategies are different.</p> <p>Yet the government has only a slim majority. Imagine if we could agree across party lines to use parliament for shared objectives.</p> <p>We might not be able to have an impact on the big, symbolic policy areas \u2013 shifting the NHS or changing fiscal priorities \u2013 but we could do something.</p> <p>If we wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/25/dont-privatise-rbs-break-it-up-into-local-banks-urges-nef-thinktank\" title=\"\">break up Royal Bank of Scotland into local lending institutions</a>, we could hammer out a cross-party strategy to achieve that. If we wanted all public service contracts to be in the public domain, ending commercial confidentiality for public services, we could do that too.</p> <p>It might sound unexciting. It might stretch parliamentary conventions. There will be squabbles about who can claim the credit. But if we can achieve things together \u2013 then and only then can we be united enough to be a bit more ambitious.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s been a difficult time for BBC programming: The Voice went to ITV, the salvage-yard version of Top Gear was poorly received and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/13/the-great-british-bake-off-disaster-why-the-bbc-got-burned\" title=\"\">The Great British Bake Off has been lost to Channel 4</a>. The BBC appears to have retained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/14/i-love-the-great-british-bake-off-not-mel-sue\" title=\"\">GBBO presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins</a>, but the format and the bunting went to the highest bidder. The success of the transplant is by no means certain.</p> <p>The loss of GBBO raises questions about the corporation\u2019s ability to retain and exploit its greatest successes in the long term, but there is a more pressing issue: how does the BBC replace its most popular programme, while hanging on to some portion of the Bake Off\u2019s devoted audience? Here are just few suggestions for reheating the format:</p> <h2><strong>Bakers\u2019 Dozen</strong></h2> <p>Mel and Sue return with a new series pitting 13 bakers against one another in what is definitely not a&#xa0;tent, but more of an inflatable shed, known as Great Cakes Headquarters (GCHQ). In each programme, bakers will face three challenges: the Trial of Self-knowledge, the Artisanal Struggle and the Overblown, Failed Masterpiece. The main difference between this programme and any other unnamed televised baking competition is that in this one, if you cut yourself, you\u2019re out. Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry are still on hand to judge proceedings, although for complex legal reasons they must stay suspended overhead in a tethered hot-air balloon.</p> <h2><strong>Masterchef: The Amateurs, Who Bake</strong></h2> <p>This very slight twist on the time-honoured Masterchef formula starts off with 12 amateur cooks from around the nation who are prepared to take baking to the next level. Gregg Wallace and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/05/nadiya-hussain-i-like-to-think-im-the-exciting-parent-but-i-know-im-not\" title=\"\">former Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain</a> provide the good cop/bad cop judging, while Mel and Sue remain in the kitchen to actively sabotage contestants\u2019 efforts \u2013 adding unwanted ingredients, swapping recipe pages, turning off ovens, etc. Baking does not get tougher than this; certainly not on Channel 4.</p> <h2><strong>Top Bake</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Contestants will be whisking around the world in more ways than one in this flashy, over-the-top baking competition. Would-be champion bakers travel to the Andes to experience making cakes at high altitude (less baking powder, hotter oven, or else), make hash brownies in a country where marijuana is legal, and take turns trying to produce the perfect baked alaska in Alaska. Top Bake also features reviews of new cookery equipment and a regular celebrity segment called Star With a Reasonably Edible Victoria Sponge.</p> <h2><strong>The Eurovision Baking Contest</strong></h2> <p>This format makes generous use of footage from the various European Great British Bake Off spinoffs currently on air, including Italy\u2019s popular Dolci al Forno (Sweets in the Oven) and Romania\u2019s Coc Bine Sau Devin Divor\u021bat (Bake Well or Become Divorced). In the grand final, six contestants from across the continent will compete to become Europe\u2019s most proficient baker, winning a year\u2019s residency at a top London patisserie (pending changes to free-movement legislation).</p> <h2><strong>Bakers Island</strong></h2> <p>Imagine being marooned on a remote desert island without electricity, food, shelter or a reliable source of drinking water. Now imagine having to produce two dozen perfect petit fours for Mel and Sue, who are sailing over for tea on Tuesday. That leaves barely enough time to whittle a rolling pin. Ray Mears drops by to show the survivors how to work with marzipan during a monsoon.</p>",

The latest polls have the AfD as the fifth strongest party in the state parliament, behind four others with a broadly pro-refugee stance \u2013 a reminder, perhaps, that fears of rising rents still register higher than fears of terrorism in Berlin.</p> <p>On closer inspection, the Christian Democrats\u2019 crisis in the city looks like a reflection of the party\u2019s struggles nationally rather than the failure to engage with attitudes on interior security at a local level.</p> <p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall authorities in the German capital have had to work with tighter restrictions on state surveillance than have affected other big cities internationally. While almost 15,000 CCTV cameras are installed at rail stations and on public transport, data privacy regulations stop the police from installing, in public spaces, cameras that transmit images in real time.</p> <p>The city\u2019s police union argues that such restrictions put its officers at a disadvantage compared with those in regions such as Bavaria, where they can set up mobile CCTV units. \u201cAt the moment, we are short of qualified staff and state-of-the-art kit, which means we are always one step behind the criminals\u201d, said Bodo Pfalzgraf, the union chief.</p> <p>In June, Henkel, then still the Berlin senate\u2019s interior minister, had tried to change local law to allow CCTV surveillance of crime hotspots such as Alexanderplatz and Kottbusser Tor in Kreuzberg. But the proposal failed partly because of a last-minute intervention by the Pirate party, which entered the state parliament in 2011 on a data protection agenda.</p> <p>The defeat left Henkel\u2019s conservatives with an issue to campaign on, but little evidence that they were up to the task of changing Berlin\u2019s cultural consensus around surveillance when they were in power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5db02337836671f1eb4d29a2fed2943346abbb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5db02337836671f1eb4d29a2fed2943346abbb5/54_0_3044_4471/681.jpg\" alt=\"A man claiming to be a Syrian refugee holds up a sign that reads: \u2018I love Mrs Merkel, thank you for your help\u2019 at a CDU campaign rally in Berlin.\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man claiming to be a Syrian refugee holds up a sign that reads: \u2018I love Mrs Merkel, thank you for your help\u2019 at a CDU campaign rally in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>At the time of writing, Britain is in a heatwave. While welcome for many, it\u2019s wholly inconvenient for me, because I am now officially in autumn for work, and meant to be writing about heavy foundations, warming scents and thick, unctuous creams to soothe wind-chapped faces. Instead, I\u2019m thinking only of products that will dry down the stickiness or stay put beyond noon.</p> <p>Enter Smashbox\u2019s superlative new <a href=\"http://www.smashbox.co.uk/product/6187/42939/Whats-New/STUDIO-SKIN-24-HOUR-CONCEALER/New/index.tmpl\"><strong>Studio Skin 24-Hour Concealer</strong></a> (\u00a320), a full-coverage liquid cover-up for all skin tones except very pale (\u201clight\u201d, while a perfect match for me, won\u2019t be light enough for some Brits). I don\u2019t recall ever using a mainstream concealer that delivered so well on longevity; I even slept in it during testing, and it was pristine upon waking some 22 hours after application (as&#xa0;was my pillowcase). My only word of caution is that your \u201cplaytime\u201d (ie, the period you have in which to blend the product before it sets) is limited \u2013 faff too long, and it streaks and blotches, but a swift application, area by area, is flawless.</p> <p>It\u2019s a good job Studio Skin remains so entrenched when, in summer, I\u2019m prone to using a cooling facial spritz liberally. My perennial favourites are <a href=\"http://uk.lizearle.com/cleanse-tone-moisturise/instant-boost-skin-tonic.html\"><strong>Liz Earle Instant Boost Tonic</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.lookfantastic.com/caudalie-grape-water-75ml/10623029.html\"><strong>Caudalie Grape Water</strong></a> (both \u00a36), because both smell so lovely as to be instantly cheering and reviving, and come in small, fridge door- and handbag-friendly containers, delivering fine mist that doesn\u2019t mess with underlying makeup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/20/beauty-new-products-for-dehydrated-skin\">Beauty: new products for dehydrated skin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that there\u2019s any danger of my mascara running, because I\u2019m wedded to tubing formulations such as Clinique\u2019s (especially <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Clinique/Makeup/Mascaras/\"><strong>Full Lash to Flutter</strong></a>, \u00a320 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/13/beauty-best-new-mascaras-sali-hughes\">see 13 August column</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/NYX-Cosmetics-Doll-Eye-Mascara/dp/B000WZ17ZU/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_1_a_it\"><strong>NYX Doll Eye Long Lash</strong></a> (\u00a37.34). For base, I&#xa0;essentially surrender to the elements and forego foundation (life\u2019s too short to feel that gross), and instead reach for <a href=\"http://www.feelunique.com/p/Giorgio-Armani-Luminessence-CC-Cream-30ml\"><strong>Giorgio Armani Luminessence SPF35</strong></a> (\u00a335), a glorious CC cream with good staying powder and visible glow.

  "<p>Marta Aksdal-Jansen lives in a flat in a beautiful 19th-century building five minutes\u2019 walk from London\u2019s Victoria station and a short stroll from the river Thames and the Houses of Parliament.</p> <p>She has a courtyard just outside, there\u2019s a \u201cwonderful\u201d on-site handyman who can help if anything needs to be fixed, and a personal trainer comes every Monday to put the building\u2019s residents through their paces. There are also monthly visits from a hairdresser and a chiropodist. Tate Britain is just down the road, and if you fancy catching a movie, the Curzon Victoria, voted London\u2019s best new cinema by Time Out, is three or four minutes\u2019 walk away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/gallery/2016/sep/19/almshouses-social-housing-with-history-in-pictures\">Almshouses:  social housing with history \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this isn\u2019t some exclusive millionaires\u2019 mansion block populated by wealthy individuals paying vast sums for the privilege of living in such a fantastic location; and Aksdal-Jansen isn\u2019t a millionaire \u2013 far from it. Yet her weekly rent of \u00a3167 is less than half the amount that someone would typically pay on the open market for a very basic one-bed flat in that part of Westminster. And that figure includes the cost of heating and water.</p> <p>So how did she manage to bag herself such an amazingly well-situated, and cheap, place to live? The answer is that she is one of the 35,000 or so people in the UK who live in an almshouse \u2013 and many may be surprised to learn that there is not always a huge waiting list to obtain one.</p> <p>Almshouses can trace their history back to the 10th century, when Athelstan, the grandson of Alfred the Great, was on the throne, but they are not just a relic of the past. They continue to play a crucial role in providing accommodation for those judged to be \u201cin need\u201d, and with an ageing population are arguably more relevant now than ever.</p> <p>Almshouses are a type of sheltered housing for those who are able to live independently and where the residents pay a \u201cweekly maintenance contribution\u201d similar to rent but different in law, and usually less than the market rate \u2013 sometimes it is as little as \u00a335 a week.</p> <p>In previous centuries you might have had to be old, decrepit and one step away from the poorhouse to be eligible to live in one. It was not unusual for the benefactor who originally set them up to insist they be reserved for particular categories of people such as \u201c<a href=\"http://wcac.org.uk/almshouses/ms.htm\">decayed tradesmen\u2019s widows of this parish</a>\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thecharterhouse.org/brothers-of-the-charterhouse/\">those ruined by shipwreck or other calamity</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05ff3e3c22a4fb611308b56bbf316b4c51a033b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05ff3e3c22a4fb611308b56bbf316b4c51a033b3/529_689_4613_2767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marta Aksdal-Jansen rents a flat from the Westminster Almshouses Foundation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marta Aksdal-Jansen rents a flat from the Westminster Almshouses Foundation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things have moved on a lot since then, but there will still often be a minimum age requirement, and you will usually need to live in the area or have a strong local connection, and be of \u201climited financial means\u201d. While most residents are 60-plus, a number of schemes cater for younger people.</p> <p>Some almshouse charities have just a couple of cottages, while others have 1,000 or more properties. \u201cThey are a significant provider of social housing in the UK,\u201d says Julian Marczak, deputy director of the <a href=\"http://www.almshouses.org\">Almshouse Association</a>, which represents more than 1,600 almshouse charities. \u201cIn rural areas, almshouses are often the only provider of accommodation for those in need.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/jul/22/government-five-year-vision-social-housing\">\u200bWhat is the government\u2019s five-year vision for social housing?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Aksdal-Jansen\u2019s home is part of the <a href=\"http://www.westminsteralmshouses.com\">Westminster Almshouses Foundation</a> in central London, which has 40 self-contained flats on one site not far from Victoria station. Each has a sitting room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, and some have a small garden or balcony.</p> <p>The charity says those wishing to apply for a flat have to be over 60 and live in Westminster; have to be able to look after themselves independently at the time they arrive; and have to have less than \u00a3100,000 in cash or assets.</p> <p>Residents are charged the maintenance contribution of \u00a3167 a week, which includes the cost of heating and water (electricity is offered at a subsidised rate, and there\u2019s free Wi-Fi). The median rent for a one-bed flat in the SW1P postcode area is \u00a3390 a week.</p> <p>Cristina O\u2019Halloran, clerk to the trustees, says: \u201cThere is a big demand [for the flats]. At the moment we have a couple of vacancies, but have some applicants lined up for them.\u201d</p> <p>The current residents are a mixture. \u201cWe have people who have come from local housing estates where perhaps they raised a family. Probably the common factor is that they don\u2019t have families to call on \u2013 there\u2019s no one in the area, or they have lost touch with their family,\u201d O\u2019Halloran adds.</p> <p>Around a third of the charity\u2019s residents are on full housing benefit so don\u2019t have to pay anything towards their rent, and another third are self-funding the full cost of their accommodation. The remainder are funded by a mixture of the two.</p> <p>Aksdal-Jansen, 74, who came to the UK from Norway when she was 21, admits that \u201cbefore I came here, I had no idea [almshouses] even existed\u201d. Divorced and with two adult sons, she has lived in one of the flats for about 11 years and says: \u201cI just love living here \u2013 we\u2019re sort of like a little community.\u201d</p> <p>When she was married she had lived in Marylebone, which is within the City of Westminster, for 20 years or more, so she made contact with the Westminster Almshouses Foundation, and it agreed to allocate her a flat, \u201cwhich was very lucky for me\u201d.</p> <h2>The modern approach</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17198bec06029dec3645f0ec71be9b8b0f43917c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17198bec06029dec3645f0ec71be9b8b0f43917c/485_3_1717_1030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s impression of the new Walthamstow almshouses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist\u2019s impression of the new Walthamstow almshouses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pollard Thomas Edwards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many almshouses occupy listed buildings, some of which date back hundreds of year; they were traditionally built in a row or around three sides of a courtyard or garden. However, there is a new breed of 21st-century almshouse, as exemplified by the very modern-looking four-storey development of 20 one-bed apartments being built in Walthamstow, north-east London. And it is largely thanks to the generosity of a schoolmaster who died of the plague more than 400 years ago that this project was able to go ahead.</p> <p>Each apartment in the building will include a double bedroom with en suite bathroom, fitted kitchen and large living room. Two of the ground floor flats will be fully wheelchair accessible and there will be a guest suite for visitors or carers, a garden room, a communal laundry, therapy room and spa bathroom.</p> <p>This will be the <a href=\"http://wcac.org.uk/\">Walthamstow and Chingford Almshouse Charity</a>\u2019s fifth building, and Liz Abbott, clerk to the directors, says that while the trustees could have opted for a traditional almshouse design, a decision was made to go for something contemporary, with big windows and lots of light.</p> <p>The charity dates back to the 16th century with the founding of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Monoux\">George Monoux</a> Almshouses in 1527, and the new flats are a far cry from those original 13 rooms, which measured 13ft by 17ft, for the elderly poor of the parish.</p> <p>The new building is due to be handed over to the charity on 19 June 2017, almost 490 years to the day since Sir George Monoux took possession of the land where the original building still stands. The charity will work with Waltham Forest council to choose the first residents, who will need to be over 55 and of \u201climited financial means\u201d, and to have lived in Walthamstow or Chingford for at least a year, or in the past for at least five consecutive years. Four of the organisation\u2019s 42 (62 from next June) almshouses have to be used to house widows.</p> <p>The weekly maintenance contribution looks set to be around \u00a3181 a week, or \u00a3784 a month, which Abbott says compares with an open market rent of about \u00a31,200 to \u00a31,300 a month for a one-bed flat. \u201cOf course, we provide an awful lot for that, including warden support.\u201d The scheme\u2019s architect, Patrick Devlin, a partner at London-based Pollard Thomas Edwards, says one of the key aims when building for older people is to try to encourage sociability because \u201cisolation is the single biggest problem\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Entry points</strong></h2> <p><strong>Who\u2019s eligible?</strong> <br>Each charity will have its own rules on things such as how old, and how financially constrained, you have to be in order to be eligible.</p> <p>The weekly maintenance contribution residents pay can also vary hugely depending on the location and type of property. Someone will probably pay more for a well-maintained flat in central London than for a small cottage in a poor state of repair. In some cases the cost of living is subsidised through the charity\u2019s endowment, and sometimes \u201crent\u201d will also include some of the bills \u2013 for example, heating and water.</p> <p><strong>Not just for older people<br> </strong>\u201cIncreasingly we\u2019re seeing examples of almshouses providing accommodation for younger people,\u201d says Julian Marczak of the Almshouse Association. For example, the <a href=\"http://girtontowncharity.co.uk\">Girton Town Charity</a> in Girton, just outside Cambridge, has 14 almshouses, including some three-bedroom homes. It says these are intended for local families, \u201cto help them save and move on to the housing ladder\u201d, as well as active retirees.</p> <p>In Harefield, a village in the London borough of Hillingdon, there are 14 family homes that were built in 2007 and are let at affordable rents, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.harefieldcharities.co.uk/charities.html#burbery\">Solomon Burbery</a> who, in his 1697 will, left a small farm with some land to provide an income for his two sisters for their lifetimes, and then for the poor of Harefield in perpetuity.</p> <p><strong>Finding out about vacancies</strong> <br>Many charities publish their vacancies on the <a href=\"http://www.almshouses.org/\">Almshouse Association</a> website; this week there were more than 20 listings. Alternatively, contact the association by phone, letter or email. Charities will often place adverts in local newspapers or libraries.

  "<h2>I don\u2019t want to compete with friends for the few jobs left in disability support</h2> <p><strong>I work in higher education disability and dyslexia support, a sector that is undergoing a huge change due to government policy and cuts. I have been on a zero-hours contract for 10 years.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>Work has always been insecure and I have also taken a series of part-time and temporary contracts, plus freelancing, in order to make enough money to live on. I\u2019ve also recently put myself through a distance learning course and gained a teaching qualification so that I am fully qualified and equipped to seek out work in the sector.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>I have tried out other kinds of jobs in student support, but this area of work is the one I love.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>Recently, jobs have come up that are guaranteed, part-time hours contracts, but they are like gold dust.&#xa0; The academic support community is tightknit and I am good friends with a lot of the people going for the same jobs as myself. We all know each other and the nature of our jobs is supportive and non-competitive, as we are helping students overcome barriers to their learning and assisting them in developing the skills they need.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>I am finding competing against colleagues and friends very difficult. I didn\u2019t get through the last interview process for one of these posts, which has knocked my belief in my ability.&#xa0; I am having a bit of a crisis of confidence as I want my friends and colleagues to do well, but at the same time I know that I need to shine. It\u2019s making me more worried and more nervous about my applications and interviews.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>Am I being too soft? How do I try to get over this?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Your concern is understandable and in many ways admirable, but to allow it to affect your behaviour would be misguided and unnecessary, and would help no one. Just remember what it is that you and your friends and colleagues are committed to doing: you all derive your job satisfaction from helping those students who most need help, who, through no fault of their own, have a disability. With experienced and expert support they can learn to overcome these unjust barriers and develop the skills they need in order to live happy and self-sufficient lives. They deserve the best, most talented and dedicated of&#xa0;teachers.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that you and your friends will be interviewed for the same jobs. This is the inevitable consequence of a selection process that is designed to take on those most capable of helping these disadvantaged students. So it\u2019s in those students\u2019 interests that all those applying for such roles do not see themselves as competing with each other, but rather as showing that they meet the highest professional standards.</p> <p>I very much doubt that you would expect a good friend and colleague to be deliberately hesitant in interview for fear of being preferred to you, and no one will expect that of you.</p> <p>Just keep reminding yourself that the most important people here are the students. You would be wrong to deny them your skills. You need to do your very best at interviews, not to do down your friends but to serve the students.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Don\u2019t think of it as a competition. You are offering yourself as a candidate and the selection panel makes the decision. If you get selected then your colleagues will be happy for you, just as you would be for them. If you don\u2019t apply, and your colleagues also don\u2019t apply, then the people you are helping will lose out \u2013 and that isn\u2019t what you want. <strong>Theoldun</strong></p> <p>\u2022 You imply that you have the same skills and experience as your colleagues, that you are a homogenous group. This is your error and the reason you feel as you do. In reality, every one of you has your own strengths, weaknesses, approach and experience. The key is to bring out and honestly represent who you are as a professional \u2013 your passions and areas of expertise. The panel may or may not be looking for what you offer. They may prefer those of one of your \u201ccompetitors\u201d. This doesn\u2019t mean you are inferior to them. It just means they were looking for something different.</p> <p>In this way, you can see which elements of the process you can control, and those you can\u2019t. A better metaphor would be a jigsaw, where recruiters are trying to find the piece that fits. All you and your colleagues can do is represent yourself the best you can. <strong>room32 </strong></p> <h2>I was put off a degree due to the debt involved \u2013 but how do I find creative work?</h2> <p><strong>I am probably in the same sinking ship of despair as many other young people, but I honestly can\u2019t find much help for my situation. I am a well-travelled and curious 24-year-old, but I cannot find a job where I feel I belong.</strong></p> <p><strong>I wanted to study at university, but the thought of throwing my mortarboard in the air in delight, when in fact I&#xa0;had \u00a350,000 of debt, was enough to put me off.

I have so much to give when I am really passionate in my work. But I am not sure which way to turn, as I have no experience working in the creative industries, and no degree.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Even a good degree wouldn\u2019t necessarily guarantee you a job in the creative industries. But before others can accept your self-assessment of having creative ability, they will quite understandably look for evidence. Although you say that your main creative focus is photography and all aspects of design, I\u2019m not clear from your letter just how much actual, physical work you have to show for it.</p> <p>You will greatly increase your chances of landing the sort of job you desire if you have an immaculate and intriguing portfolio of work. If no such portfolio exists, set about compiling one&#xa0;immediately. It should have an online presence and ideally be modular, so you&#xa0;can easily adapt it to be relevant to different sectors: retail, travel, architecture and so on. You should then actively target companies within&#xa0;these sectors. Your varied work experiences from around the world, carefully selected for each application, could also prove valuable.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s unclear if you want to work \u201cin the&#xa0;industry\u201d or to actually be creative. The latter needs no degree \u2013 go out and practise photography, put your best work online, practise designing stuff, come up with ideas, share them online, see if you have friends who work in places where your ideas could become reality. Or get a non-creative job in a place where creative jobs happen. Show&#xa0;interest, share ideas and see if those are good enough to get you shifting across jobs. <strong>whood</strong></p> <p>\u2022 If student loans worry you that much, study architecture in Germany.

  "<p>I was researching the autumn collection, looking for the boyish side of the story that best embodies the <a href=\"https://www.chloe.com/gb\">Chlo\u00e9</a> attitude. I looked at motocross and the more I looked, this one woman\u2019s face kept coming up, in photographs that looked as if they were from the 1970s. That was Anne-France Dautheville. I looked deeper into her story and found out she was a Frenchwoman who decided to go solo on a bike through the Middle East, South America and Australia. She wasn\u2019t the first one to do it but she was the first one to write about it \u2013 in the books <a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/Une-demoiselle-sur-une-moto/dp/B003UAKY9Y\">Une Demoiselle sur une Moto</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/jai-suivi-vent-Anne-France-Dautheville/dp/2080650149/ref=la_B001K79YAE_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470047362&amp;sr=1-2\">Et J\u2019ai Suivi le Vent</a>. She came from an aristocratic background and worked as a copywriter in a Parisian advertising agency and as a journalist, funding her trips through her writing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08d017e2229a5fca48da4ba0d4577449e98ded7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08d017e2229a5fca48da4ba0d4577449e98ded7f/0_188_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clare Waight Keller, creative director at Chlo\u00e9\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clare Waight Keller, creative director at Chlo\u00e9</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We found out that Anne-France lived an hour from Paris and we went for lunch with her. Afterwards she brought out four or five boxes of slides and it became clear from those that she was such a Chlo\u00e9 woman. She reminded me of [Chlo\u00e9 founder] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/sep/28/gaby-aghion\">Gaby Aghion</a> \u2013 feisty, with inner strength. She had things made for her \u2013 the leather safari jacket, very much like the one in the show, and the leather salopettes \u2013 but also took along beautiful dresses, high heels and kohl eyeliner. She said to me: \u201cEven on a trip for 12,000 miles, I am a Parisienne.\u201d</p> <p>I was hugely inspired, especially by what she took on trips. I found her only five or six weeks before the show but she chimed with what I was working on because, although Chlo\u00e9 is very dreamy, Gaby was very spontaneous, a go-getter. And Anne-France had that in spades. She always wore a scarf and biker boots unless she was out to dinner. I used that for the show, and tried to capture her attitude, too \u2013 in the makeup, for example, all the models had kohl under their eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56c141eb203d9bedaa730d49158aee43598d70c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56c141eb203d9bedaa730d49158aee43598d70c0/0_0_1822_1238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne-France Dautheville in the leather salopettes she had custom made for her trip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne-France Dautheville in the leather salopettes she had custom-made for her trip.

There\u2019s an innocence to that time in the 1970s, and there are joyful moments \u2013 photographs of her sitting with Afghan children with the bike next to her. She said no one from France really went to that part of the world then; they might go as far as Turkey or Morocco, but not Afghanistan, Pakistan or Iran. Her parents were mortified by her trip. She said she could have been a copywriter and had a nice life but she wanted to go on an adventure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec9f7e39b1006995ff82b52f3319eb1c2645859e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec9f7e39b1006995ff82b52f3319eb1c2645859e/0_249_4778_2868/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models wearing clothes inspired by Anne-France Dautheville backstage at the Chlo\u00e9 A/W 16 show at Paris fashion week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models wearing clothes inspired by Anne-France Dautheville backstage at the Chlo\u00e9 A/W 16 show in Paris.

She is very poetic and loves mythology and the thoughts behind words. I love the way she speaks, which she does as fluently in English as in French. She knits her own sweaters, is very slender and chic, and still wears her kohl eyeliner \u2013 she doesn\u2019t leave the house without it. She was still biking until two years ago when she had an accident. She says people in her village think she is crazy.</p> <p>More often than not I have a very broad story in mind when designing a collection. Having a muse galvanises it and makes decisions very easy because you are essentially making a wardrobe for someone. You design on a character \u2013 so she would wear a blouse with leather pants because she wouldn\u2019t have many clothes with her. Everything referenced back to her travel wardrobe. In a way that\u2019s not too dissimilar to how we dress today: we might get attached to something and wear it over and over again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ef9582b3faf66027f4ea1e8ebfd640d950bdda1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ef9582b3faf66027f4ea1e8ebfd640d950bdda1/0_150_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chloe show, AW/16, Paris fashion week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chloe show, AW/16, Paris fashion week.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Swan Gallet/WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pieces in the collection all have a very boyish fit and they\u2019re quite iconic, not overly designed. The way I design at Chlo\u00e9 is about the boyish and the ultra-feminine, and the tension between the two. I love to play with that and I am always looking for muses that fit that bill because it is so interesting making a collection when I find one.</p> <p>Anne-France had no clue who we were when we first contacted her. But she was thrilled when she found out that we were basing a whole collection on her; she said it was like angels coming into her life, allowing her to remember a wonderful time in her career. She couldn\u2019t come to the show because she was promoting a new novel, but I have spent so much time with her and every time, more and more stories come out. She could definitely have another collection in her.</p>",

This was not because Gard hadn\u2019t been warned that using a phone while driving was dangerous and illegal. He had been convicted of the offence at least six times before, the most recent just weeks before the crash when he had persuaded a magistrate not to take away his driving licence, promising to lock his phone in the boot from then on.</p> <p>Here was a man who thought he knew better than the fools who reckon that you need hands, eyes and attention to hurtle a heavy, potentially fatal object through space. According to Darrell Martin, Gard had nine seconds in which to see his brother and act accordingly, nine seconds that he chose to spend sharing the trivial minutiae of his own day, thereby robbing another man of his life.

Much of this is blamed on cuts in traffic policing. But if fewer people are getting caught, the sensible thing would be to beef up the consequences when they are.</p> <p>Currently, it\u2019s only a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/using-mobile-phones-when-driving-the-law\" title=\"\">\u00a3100 fine and three points for a first offence</a>, and \u201cgetting caught\u201d on multiple occasions didn\u2019t stop Gard. How can you get it through to people that rather than getting caught, ploughing into another human is the thing they should be afraid of? How do you get it through to people that they are risking their own and others\u2019 lives?</p> <p>In the past the answer has been massive public awareness campaigns, painstakingly spelling out the dangers as shockingly as public decency allows, again and again and again. Campaigners are pinning their hopes on the idea that a similar blitz on mobile phone use would work.</p> <p>Yet these tactics have limitations. People still endlessly complain about speed cameras and speed bumps, because simply warning people that speeding is hellishly dangerous isn\u2019t enough. People still declare that they know their own alcohol limits better than any breathalyser does, or that smoking skunk actually helps them to drive better. The psychology of driving is itself, I\u2019m sure, part of the problem.</p> <p>I don\u2019t drive myself \u2013 too useless \u2013 so I really notice the driving mentality. The massive increase in physical power that getting behind the wheel confers seems similarly to boost egos. People feel impregnable in their cars, more in control, oblivious to the fact that these are machines that deliver injury and death every day. Sometimes people feel intensely that their car is a totally private space, a tiny peripatetic kingdom over which they rule.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People feel impregnable in cars, more in control, oblivious to the fact that these machines deliver injury and death</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Being a driver makes people feel free. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so easy, behind the wheel, to persuade yourself that the rules don\u2019t apply to you. Other drivers empathise with that. The hapless magistrate who was persuaded to let Gard continue driving \u2013 it\u2019s likely he too believed that taking away the right to drive was taking away liberty. The liberties this man took at the wheel? Somehow, they weren\u2019t seen as important signals that Gard wasn\u2019t free but instead was out of control.</p> <p>My dad, a rightwing libertarian by instinct, was furious when it was made illegal to drive without a seatbelt, and furious that so much cash was being spent on telling him what to do with his own life in his own car. In the US, of course, such fury is much more widespread, which is why airbag technology had to be invented along with bossy cars which remind you that somebody hasn\u2019t been good. My dad, who wasn\u2019t a big drinker and wasn\u2019t into speeding, was much less annoyed about the campaigns telling people not to do that stuff. In fact, he rather approved.</p> <p>That\u2019s the odd thing about public awareness campaigns. They often preach to the converted. People who already accept that it\u2019s dangerous to drive and use a phone will listen.

  "<p>Pie is joy guaranteed: the very definition of a simple pleasure. Pie \u2013 apple, with ice-cream \u2013 is what got <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Road\">Sal Paradise</a> clean across America and what makes a Thanksgiving spread to be thankful for. A half-time pie gets most Aston Villa fans through a painful match. And meat pies with tomato sauce are defining components not just of New Zealand and Aussie rugby fandom, but of basic national identity.</p> <p>As with anything so fundamental, variations on the traditional way of doing things do not go down well. To wit, the <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/64629\">5,687 people who signed a petition last year</a> calling for anyone making a crustless pie to face criminal sanctions. But variations there are, from hand-raised hot-water crust specials to delicate puff-pastry pithiviers, lattice-topped fruit stews and Greek spanakopitas: the pie is about as old as eating itself. It\u2019s the proto-dish, a self-contained meal \u2013 as satisfyingly portable as pizza, but so much more hearty. And it should be hearty \u2013 a thin pie is either a misnomer for a tart or a baked disappointment. Frugality is not what you\u2019re going for here. And it isn\u2019t, judging by your efforts: you\u2019ve done justice to the width and breadth of everything a pie can be. Smiles all round.</p> <h2>The winning recipe: Garden pot pie</h2> <p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/Bryony%20Bowie\"><em>Bryony Bowie</em></a>\u2019s old-fashioned treat was exactly what you want from a savoury pie: so savoury, in fact, that you don\u2019t even realise it\u2019s meatless. Rich but not heavy, filling but not dense; a meal for every day.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4-6</strong><br>1 onion, roughly chopped<br>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br>2 sticks celery, chopped<br>1 large leek, washed and chopped<br>2 carrots, peeled and chopped<br>2 potatoes (about 350g), peeled and roughly diced<br>A knob of butter <br>2 tsp dried thyme<br>50g plain flour<br>500ml vegetable stock<br>300ml single cream<br>1 tsp french mustard<br>1 bay leaf<br>\u00bd tsp grated nutmeg<br>400g tin of butterbeans, drained<br>50g curly kale, tough stems removed<br>10 fresh sage leaves, roughly chopped<br>320g pack ready-rolled puff pastry<br>1 egg, beaten</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Gently fry the onion, garlic, celery, leek, carrots and potatoes in a large pan with a knob of butter. Cook for 15 minutes, or until the veg is soft. Add the thyme and flour. Stir to coat and cook for a further 2 minutes.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Stir in the stock, cream, mustard, bay leaf, nutmeg and butter beans. Bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer for 15 minutes, or until reduced. About 3-5 minutes before the end, add the kale and sage, and season to taste. Turn off the heat and allow to cool slightly before transferring to your pie dish.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Set the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Grease the rim of your filled pie dish, then cut a thin strip of pastry, about 2cm wide, and press it on to the edge. Brush with cold water and cover with the rest of the pastry. Trim away the excess, then crimp the edges. Cut two slits into the middle and brush with beaten egg. You can use the leftover pastry to make shapes: just remember to glaze these with egg, too.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Bake for 45 minutes, until the pastry is puffed up and golden. Serve with steamed green veg and salad.</p> <h2><strong>Homity pie</strong></h2> <p>I took one bite of <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/clairetweet\"><em>ClaireTweet</em></a>\u2019s pie, and it took every bit of willpower I had not to polish the whole thing off. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0a398aa0946f309ab3702aa5bdbf47a7781a00a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0a398aa0946f309ab3702aa5bdbf47a7781a00a/0_0_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Homity pie\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Just don\u2019t make it if you\u2019re on a diet,\u2019 says Claire Tweet.

So I made it with the leftover cheeses I had in mine (an eye\u2011wateringly sharp Greek goat\u2019s milk, some feta and a hunk of comte).

Grease a 23cm round cake tin with melted butter. Line the cake tin with one filo sheet, letting the edges overhang.

The sides of the cake tin should be evenly covered by the overhanging edges of the filo sheets.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Fill the pastry-lined tin with the cheese mixture, drizzle the honey over the cheese, then fold the overhanging pastry loosely over the top, brushing butter over the top after each layer of pastry has been folded in.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Bake in the oven for 35 minutes, or until the filling has set and the pastry has become golden.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Remove from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes before cutting into wedges.

Turn the thighs over and add the bay leaf, onions, carrots and celery. Add the boiling water, season, cover, bring to a boil once again, then simmer on a low heat until the chicken is cooked through \u2013 about 20-25 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and let it cool. Remove and discard the skin and bones, shred it into bite-size pieces and set aside. It should come up to about 300-350g of chicken.

Arrange the almonds over the bottom and the sides, spaced apart. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough until it is 3-4mm thick and almost double the size of the dishes. Fit the dough into the dishes, pressing it gently into the almonds you\u2019ve already put at the bottom. Trim the dough around the edges of the dishes, but leave enough overhanging to cover the rice completely. Put the filling into the pastry and gently pull the edges of the dough over the filling. Brush the top with some butter, cover with some foil or a baking sheet, then bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until golden.

Set aside to cool.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Blanch the sliced celeriac in lightly salted boiling water for 2-3 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to about 5\u20136mm thick. You will need to cut out 2 circles, one bigger than the other. I used plates to cut around. The pastry base had a diameter of 25cm and the pastry top was 29cm. Make the top at least 3cm larger so it covers the topping.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Lay the smaller pastry circle on a lined baking tray and prick several times with a fork.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Lay out some of the celeriac slices over the smaller circle. Make sure that you don\u2019t go all the way to the edge; leave a margin of at least 2cm (as this will form your pie edge). Add a little of the onion and garlic. Sprinkle over a few fresh thyme leaves and the crumbled blue cheese. Season with black pepper.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Repeat the layers. Depending on how big your pastry base is, you may only get two complete layers in, or perhaps three.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Brush the pastry margin with a little of the beaten egg.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Lay the larger pastry circle over the top (trying to keep it centred). Press down on the edges with your fingers to seal the filling in. I cut out a tiny circle in the top, to allow steam to escape, but gently rested the cut-out pastry circle on its hole (as the pastry will expand when cooking).</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Brush with the beaten egg and set aside in the fridge for 20 minutes before baking. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown.</p> <h2><strong>Mojito key lime pie</strong></h2> <p>That settles it: <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/ColonialCravings\"><em>ColonialCravings</em></a> is a master with booze in the kitchen.

  "<p>For almost 18 months, up until April,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stella-grey\" title=\"I wrote\"> I wrote a column in Family</a> about my midlife online dating disasters, an experience that ended in triumph when I found Edward on a website as I was deleting myself from it. Now we live together, I\u2019ve been thinking about how different cohabiting is the second time round. Edward and I had been in long marriages before living alone, and shacking up has presented unforeseen hazards and lessons. Here are 13 things I have learned.</p> <p>1 Shopping, cooking, entertainments and housework are subjects full of unexpected traps. Ordinary things you\u2019ve done with someone else for 20 years (and then in a self-determining way for another two) are abruptly sources of controversy. Suddenly there\u2019s a man on the next sofa cushion who is, in a word, alien. He can\u2019t miss an episode of Robot Wars, doesn\u2019t like Almod\u00f3var and finds televised motor racing relaxing. These aren\u2019t bad things in themselves \u2013 taste is taste \u2013 but they have to be acclimatised to. This alien in your bed, this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbEBErvW-Uc\" title=\"Mork\">Mork</a>: he\u2019s the man who buys the cheap pizzas, not really seeing the difference; he\u2019s revealed as a natural Frugal, while you\u2019re a natural Lavish. When you\u2019re away he buys a pouch of filled pasta, eats half and keeps the rest for the following day. He suggests that the cooked soggy broccoli he put in the fridge in a bowl be \u201cused up\u201d in the mac cheese.</p> <p>2 Unexpectedly, kitchens can be flashpoints. You come into a midlife shack-up with ingrained domestic habits. I overstock the dry goods cupboard, perhaps subconsciously convinced that Armageddon will come without warning. Having nine kinds of pasta and every spice known to botany makes me feel safe. Edward limits himself to heavy sighs when he opens the doors and there\u2019s a cous-cous avalanche. He doesn\u2019t get that the shelves in the fridge are hierarchical. Cream goes on the top shelf with the cheese, right? It never goes on the bottom shelf with the meat, ever. I have declared there is no cream and he\u2019s gone and produced it from behind some pork loins and I have been bulgy eyed with critique. He doesn\u2019t rinse and squeeze the sponge when he\u2019s mopped the worktop and this insignificant thing has brought us the closest we\u2019ve come to a blazing row. The thing they never tell you about living with someone is that the worst arguments you\u2019ll ever have (barring bankruptcy, adultery, pranged cars and other such trivia) will start with a kitchen sponge.</p> <p>3 Learn how the other operates when you disagree. We\u2019re starting to take account of that, which is a skill it has taken me all my life to learn. I used to rush in, during my marriage, and escalate and make generalised accusations and self-sabotage. I\u2019m getting better at taking a breath and listening. A recent incident ended with me saying calmly, \u201cYou\u2019re getting on my nerves,\u201d and him saying, \u201cSometimes you get on mine,\u201d and me saying, \u201cSometimes I\u2019m bloody annoying when I\u2019m right,\u201d and him saying, \u201cSometimes, yes, you are, but not often. Hardly ever.\u201d</p> <p>We kissed and that was that. This talk-down technique has worked in both directions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sex-wise, you need to find your real pattern, which might not tally with the one you had when you were dating</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>4 Resist the urge to be Veruca (or Vernon) Salt about getting things your own way, but be prepared for some saltiness: when two busy traffic streams converge, there\u2019s always an adjustment period. Sometimes the other person will secretly be grateful that you\u2019re a control freak because they don\u2019t want the job of rummaging through every antique pair of curtains on eBay looking for The One. They\u2019ve had enough of looking for The One. It\u2019s vital for both of you to sharpen your awareness of when taking the initiative is necessary and wanted. And when it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>5 Tolerance is hugely important. I\u2019ve become almost cool about Edward\u2019s need to watch golf on TV. He is tolerant of my need to research everything to the nth, including holiday locations (he favours a lucky dip approach). While investigating the possibility of buying a teeny European bolthole for our old age, I announced that I\u2019d found a great village by a Spanish lake, but then discounted it because the lake was a reservoir and I once had a dream in which big sucky pipes under the surface of one sucked me right in and away, and Edward sat nodding sagely before saying, \u201cNo reservoirs, then. Noted.\u201d</p> <p>Mutual resilience about the other\u2019s quirks is a key signifier of contentment, and contentment is the state to aim for. Contentment\u2019s relaxed and everyday and sustainable. Happiness is often too uppy a state to last and the inevitable downy can easily be misinterpreted as a catastrophe, whereas contentment ambles along in the inter-zonal.</p> <p>6 Sex-wise, you need to find your real pattern, which might not tally with the one you had when you were dating. For us, there are a) periods of intense activity \u2013 OK, not usually that intense \u2013 interspersed with b), sibling snuggling-up like the babes in the wood. Occasionally one of us is in A mode while the other is definitely in B. This happened the other night. \u201cWhy are you jiggling?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s that fidgetiness mean?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m frisky. It means I\u2019m frisky.\u201d \u201cOh God, no. Go to sleep. I\u2019m so tired.\u201d He started rubbing the small of my back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cYou there. You try to whisk my PJ trousers off and I\u2019ll thump you in the Adam\u2019s apple.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s lucky for me that he thinks I\u2019m funny, and that he can make me howl with laughter. Nothing is as underrated by the young as the necessity of that.</p> <p>7 Incompatible circadian rhythms might unexpectedly be a thing. Edward is a lark and I used to be a night owl but, like nuns in a convent whose menstrual cycles get into sync, I\u2019m gravitating into lark mode and have started to see a midnight bedtime as daringly late. We\u2019re often ensconced with books and the teapot by 10pm, like picture book pre-digital-age midlifers, like Raymond Briggs\u2019 Jim and Hilda. \u201cI\u2019m glad I have you,\u201d I say sometimes, when we\u2019ve kissed our goodnights. I mean it most fervently.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We confess our failings to one another and find them amusing. An inability to admit them is even funnier</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>8 If you are ready to embrace the cardigan, be sure not to move in with a snowboarder. Our holidays are growing steadily more middle aged; we\u2019re probably only a biscuit\u2019s width from coach trips to Germany so as to cruise along the Rhine. With only ourselves to please, we can hit the Neolithic trail and dawdle round magnificent gardens, where Latin plant names have been noted on phones.</p> <p>9 Little ways of showing your love are a big deal. Edward was hugely supportive of my writing the book, even though it\u2019s about the lead-up to him and then him specifically. He doesn\u2019t want to read it but says he hopes others find it useful; it hasn\u2019t much to do with who we are now. He smiles and shrugs, when he says so, and the love and trust really move me.</p> <p>He\u2019ll say \u201cYou look nice,\u201d if I make an effort, but he doesn\u2019t care if there\u2019s makeup or not, or what I weigh; he has no ghoulish notions about a woman being an asset on his arm. He\u2019s getting wrinkly and greyer and his jawline isn\u2019t what it was when we met and nor is mine and he doesn\u2019t give a shit. He\u2019s unselfconsciously self-accepting and that is inspiring.</p> <p>10 You should be able to relax completely and be yourself. We socialise a little bit, keep a sketchy track of culture, but essentially we\u2019re home bodies. We hole up with hot chocolate and books and blankets and music and box sets and big socks. He falls asleep with a Robert Harris clutched to his chest and I feel a surge of fondness. We\u2019ve been known to draw down the blinds on a Sunday morning and watch a thriller and eat ginger sponge pudding, though that\u2019s about as transgressive as it gets.</p> <p>11 At some point while shacked up, the M word may arise. Marriage. Is it worth doing again, when really there\u2019s no need? We\u2019re good as we are. I have occasional hankerings, I admit, for \u201cI do\u201d (and how it would make my mother less anxious) and an incredible dress and rose petals thrown at my head. And for our coming old age. I never want to be in a situation in which he\u2019s in hospital with a stroke and I am not next of kin, for some outmoded reason. Or vice versa.</p> <p>12 There ought to be a mutual plan for the next chapter. That\u2019s part of the second chance romance: using the newness and freshness to have new and fresh ideas. We have an optimistic view of our 60s. Sixty is still some way off but it\u2019s on the horizon, and if the span of life is marked off into quarters, 60-80 is probably going to be the final segment. As Jeff Bridges said recently, he thinks of retirement as re-tyrement, having new tyres fitted to life and going off in a new direction. It\u2019s a weak pun but I know what he means. How you see your final quarter unfolding is a key point of compatibility, one you mightn\u2019t have thought about when you were gaily (or not so gaily) wading through available matches on CloseToDespair.com.</p> <p>13 It\u2019s important to trust enough to be saved from aspects of yourself. I have obsessive and perfectionist tendencies, so three trips to paint stockists and 11 matchpots daubed on to squares of lining paper were needed to decide on the sitting room walls. A trip to a garden centre to get two pots to flank our door turned into four visits and nine pots, and six clematis plants and four geraniums and three rose bushes, and if Edward hadn\u2019t pleaded for a cease-fire the war on the garden would never have ended. I was happy to admit to this. We confess our failings to one another and find them amusing. An inability to admit to them is even funnier, and that\u2019s pretty key. Once the wall colours were agreed upon we spent a happy week with paint rollers, singing along to the radio, and it was a bit like being 28 again. The idea that we\u2019re at the beginning, that things are fresh, unspoiled, rich with possibility \u2013 what better feeling could there be in your 50s than that?</p> <h2>Read our extract from Stella Grey\u2019s book, The Heartfix<br></h2> <p>When I told my mum I was abandoning online dating and going out to find men in the city, she clapped her hands in rejoicing. She thought there was a qualitative difference, as if finding a man online would be like finding one on sale at Aldi. Real-world men were bound to be better quality, she thought. Generally, I spared her the sad litany of failures to instigate chat in bookshops and delicatessens and with men in parks, letting my dog meet their dog. I didn\u2019t even know if I wanted to go back to that kind of happenstance. Online dating at its best sends you to meet-ups fully informed. I\u2019d grown accustomed to the data sets. I\u2019d grown used to self-descriptions, the likes and dislikes, the bucket lists and the all-round self-revealing that goes on in a properly filled-out profile page. Little is known about a stranger who asks you out while your terriers say hello to one another beside a shrubbery after five minutes of dog chat. You can\u2019t really subject them to the standard questions. You can\u2019t go barging in to their private lives, gung ho. So, are you married? Oh \u2013 single, really, that\u2019s interesting, and what are you hoping for, from a relationship, something long term? When you\u2019re used to the online way of doing things, accidental first meetings offer so little of people upfront, as facts. When you meet online it isn\u2019t usually going to take until the third date to discover that someone is a Scientologist or a conspiracy theorist, or that he has nine children.</p> <p>I\u2019d already tried singles-oriented real-world socialising, and I could only attempt it a second time if I pretended the first time hadn\u2019t happened. I\u2019d done the joining-societies thing; I\u2019d become a gallery friend and had been to public lectures. Nothing doing. How can a conversation start in those circumstances that isn\u2019t embarrassing or obvious?</p> <p>I\u2019d already humiliated myself in wine shops, rushing in, sidling up to nice-looking men and talking to them about vins de pays. They\u2019d bought their wine and gone home.</p> <p>I\u2019d tried to initiate chat with men who stopped off in the railway station food hall at six o\u2019clock, as they stood in front of the Meals for One section. I\u2019d done this in an early phase, post-separation, when my mental health wasn\u2019t the best. In my head I was someone else. I was 28 again. I could see her, the slender, striking, dark-haired girl, in the falsely reflecting mirror behind my eyes. At 28, I was flirted with on an ongoing basis, by men older and younger.</p> <p>At 28 you don\u2019t see yourself at 50, thickened in the waist and loosening around the throat. It doesn\u2019t occur to you that those same men who ogled you at the office, back then, would run a mile if they met you now, even though they\u2019re all older than you.</p> <p><em>The Heartfix by Stella Grey is published by Harper Collins, \u00a312.99.

  "<p>James is 6ft 5in tall, an imposing 45-year-old man with a successful career. He is a father of two young children and a popular, talented sportsman who excels at rugby and golf. If you got to know him well, you might discover a few quirks. He doesn\u2019t permit any black in his house. There won\u2019t ever be a leather sofa in his living room. He will never stock up on Jaffa Cakes for his kitchen cupboard. And he won\u2019t allow his four-year-old son to have a bunk bed.</p> <p>His partner, Emily, discovered the reason when she found him curled in a ball by their spare bed, a sweating \u201cgibbering wreck\u201d after they argued one day six years ago: \u201cI can still see him there, cowering, a big man, trying to get under the bed. He was like a little boy, whimpering, not lucid, as if he was in a flashback. I managed to get him on to the bed and held him, which normally he doesn\u2019t let me do. That was a pivotal moment, seeing what was going on in his head.\u201d</p> <p>In the first year of their relationship, James hinted that he\u2019d had a horrible time at school. Emily wasn\u2019t given the whole story at once but, gradually, the secret that he\u2019d kept close for more than 30 years came out: the physical and sexual abuse he\u2019d suffered when he was nine years old.</p> <p>In 1980, James\u2019s parents, a businessman and a teacher, decided that their eldest son would benefit from a private education at a boarding school in Suffolk. St George\u2019s was an impressive-looking former stately home with a sweeping drive. On his first night, he and other homesick boys were hauled out of their metal bunk-beds by two prefects. Wearing slippers, a dressing gown and starchy new pyjamas, James was led along corridors until he came to a black door beneath a winding staircase. They could hear&#xa0;crying.</p> <p>Inside was a long leather sofa, a big desk on which lay a cane and a contraption that resembled an oversized table-tennis bat and two men: Derek Slade, the headmaster, and Gerard Singer, the head of languages. James does not like to call them by their names. For him, it dignifies them. \u201cI built up such a resilience to them. I\u2019d prefer \u2018him\u2019 to be \u2018it\u2019,\u201d he says.</p> <p>James was ordered to turn around and drop his trousers. Then he was whacked with \u201csix of the best\u201d. After a few weeks and more beatings \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re punished for crying, you\u2019re punished for not having your shoes polished, it was all very regimented\u201d \u2013 James was summoned again to the room with the black door. There, waiting, were the same two teachers.</p> <p>\u201cI knocked on the black door and walked into the room and Slade was behind his desk. My normal thing was to go and adopt my position and drop my trousers, and I stood there waiting. I didn\u2019t take much notice but his trousers were round his ankles. I was waiting for the cane and he came over and thrust his penis into me and that was the first time he raped me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My relationships haven\u2019t been intimate or cuddly. I look at other couples and it tortures me that I\u2019m unable to do that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>James uses such unequivocal language now because, in the witness box of Ipswich crown court, where Singer finally stood trial earlier this summer, James was told by the judge that he had to speak more plainly. \u201cSeveral times, the judge said, \u2018You have to say what he is doing.\u2019 In court, you have to be graphic and say \u2018penis\u2019 and \u2018penis inside you\u2019 and \u2018semen\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>That was a shock to James: he hadn\u2019t been warned in advance by the Crown Prosecution Service, for whom he was a key witness.</p> <p>After the abuse, James was sent back to his dorm. \u201cAs you walk out of the door, there was a table with Jaffa Cakes. They said, \u2018Take three Jaffa Cakes\u2019. When you\u2019re away from home and the school meals are absolutely awful, a Jaffa Cake was like Willy Wonka\u2019s Golden Ticket.\u201d</p> <p>James was raped between 25 and 30 times by both teachers in a year, before they abruptly left the school without explanation. \u201cYou go home at Christmas just a broken child. I just can\u2019t get excited by Christmas now. All these things have triggers in later life.\u201d</p> <p>After they fell in love, Emily became used to James\u2019s reluctance to be tactile. Their first house had a galley kitchen. \u201cYou just can\u2019t share that space. It\u2019s like a forcefield around him. He will flinch if I go to touch him,\u201d she says. \u201cJames is not in any way violent or physically abusive. I\u2019ve never feared that he would be to any of us, but there is a swirling vortex of negative energy around him. It comes into the room with him and it\u2019s bigger than him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy relationships haven\u2019t been intimate or cuddly, I don\u2019t do all that,\u201d says James. \u201cHolding hands, touching someone\u2019s shoulder at a party, which is normal in normal relationships, is not normal for me. I look at other couples and it tortures me that I\u2019m not able to do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt also tortures me to see the closeness between other couples,\u201d adds Emily. \u201cI desperately want it too. Living like this is very lonely.\u201d</p> <p>Around the time Emily came to understand his past, James discovered several old schoolmates on Facebook discussing the arrest of their former headmaster, Derek Slade. \u201cI was really struggling with life. I was near Ipswich, where the trial was, and went into the public gallery. I saw this shrivelled old man with a big Santa Claus beard in the dock. I looked at him and he looked at me. It put the fear of God into me. I just got up and walked out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63ec5a619e78d806d37ab69bad907edc0e5cc694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63ec5a619e78d806d37ab69bad907edc0e5cc694/0_0_5574_3344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giving evidence in court was harrowing for James but afterwards, \u2018the weight went from my shoulders,\u2019 he says.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giving evidence in court was harrowing for James but afterwards, \u2018the weight went from my shoulders,\u2019 he says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Posed by model/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Slade\u2019s conviction \u2013 jailed for 21 years \u2013 \u201ctriggered something\u201d in James, and he resolved to do something about his second abuser, Gerard Singer.</p> <p>He went to the police and spent hours giving evidence and undergoing medical examinations (doctors\u2019 evidence formed part of the prosecution against Singer). Although Emily knew about his childhood trauma, James was still reluctant to share the progress of his case, which took six years to come to trial. He was upset when a new police liaison officer casually asked him what his case was about (she hadn\u2019t bothered to check) and when he was told there wasn\u2019t time to visit the court before the trial to familiarise himself with the surroundings. \u201cI felt I was always chasing the police,\u201d he says. \u201cI was expecting a bit more support. Since the trial, I\u2019ve heard nothing from them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuite often things would be terrible between us and only afterwards it would transpire that something had happened with the police or the court case,\u201d says Emily. \u201cI\u2019ve tried many times to ask him about his experiences. On the one hand, I have to be sensitive and not pry. On the other, I\u2019ve been pushed away quite venomously so many times, I\u2019m reluctant to put myself there. He keeps himself this closed book. I\u2019m a very open person but in order to preserve my own sanity I\u2019ve had to emotionally turn away.\u201d</p> <p>In this way, the abuse \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop when it stopped 35 years ago\u201d, says Emily. \u201cThe evil is still within our family because it has its impact on him and his behaviour and we\u2019re living with that every day.\u201d</p> <p>James, she says, is \u201cquite reluctant\u201d to seek help. At first, they tried couples counselling but Emily says it didn\u2019t really work. She believes he needs specialist counselling. \u201cIt takes him a long time to build up trust in the counsellor,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Giving evidence against his abuser in court was \u201cthe most harrowing thing I\u2019ve had to do in my life,\u201d says James. \u201cIt could go two ways. You could be believed or you could be back in there for contempt of court.\u201d</p> <p>On the day he was called to give evidence, their four-year-old son, Billy, could tell he was upset.</p> <p>James and Emily told him that Daddy had to sort out some problems at work. Billy disappeared and then returned. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you Daddy. I\u2019ve got Captain Barnacles. He\u2019s there to protect you.\u201d</p> <p>James put Captain Barnacles \u2013 the leader of the Octonauts cartoon \u2013 in his pocket when he stood in the witness box. \u201cWhen it was getting harrowing, I pulled him out and just broke down. I said to the jury, \u2018I\u2019ve got a four-year-old boy and a 10-month-old girl who are in this big world and I\u2019m going to do my damnedest to protect them.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve suffered torment. When a child comes to you, stop and listen. We can never eradicate evil but we can listen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For all his turmoil in court \u2013 particularly when he was cross-examined by Singer\u2019s defence barrister \u2013 \u201cthe weight went from my shoulders\u201d after he gave evidence. Most importantly, James \u2013 and eight other abused former pupils who gave evidence \u2013 was believed. Singer was found guilty of all 27 counts of abuse. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison and a further eight on licence.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve suffered torment of a great magnitude. The physical side of things is never going to heal,\u201d says James. \u201cWhen a child comes to you, stop and listen. We can never eradicate evil but we can always listen.\u201d</p> <p>After the trial, they went on holiday and Emily caught a \u201cglimpse\u201d of a happier future for their family. \u201cJames was open and communicative and perceptive and he understood how we could have a normal conversation about things and the life going on around him. I\u2019d been living with this block of stone for four years and now he was starting to show some emotion. You don\u2019t want to see someone hurting but it\u2019s preferable to them blocking it out and taking it out on everyone around them.\u201d</p> <p>However, \u201cThat kind of closed again,\u201d says Emily. \u201cI never expected everything to be instantly better. We had this amazing breakthrough. It was impossible for that to last because it can\u2019t be that easy [to get over abuse].\u201d</p> <p>Emily worries about the impact of a \u201ctoxic atmosphere\u201d on their children. \u201cI want the home to be a place of sanctuary for the children, not stress. This is the point at which things have to start moving forward or else he is never going to change. He needs to see what he has to lose. Do you want that terrible thing that happened in the past to ruin your future? Don\u2019t let those people ruin any more of your life.\u201d</p> <p>What of his parents, who sent him to the school in the first place?</p> <p>Ten years ago, when James\u2019s parents bailed him out of a serious debt, his mother asked him what was wrong and he finally told her about the abuse. He says he and his father don\u2019t have a very close bond but doesn\u2019t blame his parents for sending him away and shows me an email from his father, expressing his love, support and admiration for his son. \u201cThey did what they thought was best. I still love them, they are my parents. I\u2019m letting them heal, as they are me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>James is hopeful. \u201cEmily says all the lines have gone out of my face. She\u2019s never seen that part of me and I\u2019ve never seen that part of me. I want to put all of this dark stuff in a box. But the lid is ajar and you let a bit out and hopefully that box will gradually become empty.\u201d</p> <p><em>Names have been changed</em></p>",
  "<p>Everyone knows that Snow White \u2013 paragon of purity, beauty, youth \u2013 is hunted down by her wicked stepmother. Or is she? In the first 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tale, it is not her stepmother who orders the huntsman to cut out the girl\u2019s lungs and liver to eat, but her own mother.</p> <p>That small but crucial twist has now been resurrected. Forget Disney; a new rock-opera-cum-cabaret by La Boite Theatre Company, Opera Queensland, and Brisbane Festival dives into a far more grown-up, gory version of the fairytale. With the dwarves and the prince jettisoned in favour of competitive mother-daughter relations, this production hones in on the rabid jealousy that can arise between those bound by blood.</p> <p>The Queen (Italian opera singer Silvia Colloca) is a raven-haired autocrat in love with her own reflection. She dances the tango with the slick, servile Mirror (Kanen Breen), whose camp, catty remarks are enhanced by his black suit, bleached hair, and sparkling ruby lipstick. The Queen rules by looks: female power, for her, is bound up with being a bombshell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2016/jan/31/snow-white-and-the-seven-lines-has-disney-got-a-princess-problem\">Snow White and the seven lines: has Disney got a princess problem?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, one day, 15-year-old Snow White secretly tries on her mother\u2019s clothes. She kicks off her ugly black school loafers and gingerly slips one foot at a time into red stilettos. Over her white smock she wraps a regal gown. Encouraged by the crooning Mirror, Snow White preens and pouts. When it dawns on the Queen that her sexual prowess is about to be usurped, she orders her daughter killed. (In the Brothers Grimm version she literally desires to consume her daughter by eating her innards.)</p> <p>La Boite\u2019s Snow White is just one of a number of revivals at this year\u2019s Brisbane Festival. Together they paint a complex picture of the fairytale popularised by the Brothers Grimm in the early 19th century.</p> <p>This Sunday will see a <a href=\"http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/whats-on/snow-white-1916\">rare screening of the 1916 silent film Snow White</a>, enhanced with live music from concert pianist Mauro Colombis. Walt Disney watched this fantasy caper as a boy. It inspired him to make his animated masterpiece Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (<a href=\"http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/whats-on/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs-1937\">also showing on Sunday at Goma</a>) in 1937, replete with singing little people, cute woodland animals, and a handsome, if utterly insipid, prince. Years later he proclaimed it to be the \u201cperfect story\u201d.</p> <p>But if Disney delivered a sanitised, sugary take on a tale that has its roots in a brutal, violent Europe, the French Snow White by Ballet Preljocaj, which <a href=\"http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/whats-on/snow-white-ballet-preljocaj\">finished its run last week</a>, is more faithful to the darker tones of the original (the festival states this production is not recommended for children). With costumes designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, the wicked queen is a bondage dominatrix surrounded by prowling cats. Her punishment, as in Brothers Grimm, is a dance to the death in hot iron shoes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"816f42640d36da0f6fe41a92099c2f23ab328406\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/816f42640d36da0f6fe41a92099c2f23ab328406/0_800_3200_4000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Emilie Lalande as Snow White in Snow White - Ballet Preljocaj at QPAC at the 2016 Brisbane Festival\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emilie Lalande in Snow White by Ballet Preljocaj at 2016 Brisbane Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Liberties, however, are taken with Snow White. In the Grimm tale she is named \u201cLittle Snow White\u201d to emphasise her childish innocence. Upon her collapse from the poison apple, she is encased in a glass coffin; it is there, when she is little more than a lifeless porcelain doll, where the prince first sees and claims her. \u201cLet me have the coffin,\u201d he says to the mourning dwarfs. \u201cI will give you anything you want for it.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, Ballet Preljocaj provides Snow White with more agency. Danced by Emilie Lalande, she is not a comatose object to be possessed and traded by men, but a flirtatious tease, awake and aware (for the most part at least; after the queen shoves the apple down her throat, she becomes lifeless, her limbs animated by the devastated prince). While the rest of the dancers\u2019 movements are staccato, hers are languid and fluid, brimming with eroticism.</p> <p>In her 1971 book Transformations Pulitzer prize-winning poet Anne Sexton dubbed Snow White a \u201cdumb bunny\u201d: in the original tale, after all, she is tricked not once but three times by the wicked queen. La Boite\u2019s Snow White (played by the perfectly pitched Stephanie Pickett) is also a bunny but more of the Playboy variety.</p> <p>Like her mother \u2013 who convinces the horny, hunky Huntsman (Michael Tuahine) to kill her daughter by seducing him \u2013 Snow White quickly learns that sex is power. When the Huntsman is sent to execute her, she shows him what he\u2019s missing. This Snow White is no wilting violet or chirpy domestic busybody as in Disney\u2019s take. Nor is she like Kristen Stewart\u2019s \u201cwarrior princess\u201d, who took up arms to reclaim her kingdom in the 2012 film Snow White and the Huntsman. This Snow White is really only interested in saving herself.</p> <p>In The New Yorker, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/snow-white-beauty-is-power\">folklore scholar Maria Tatar writes</a> that early renditions of Snow White are \u201ca reflection on children\u2019s fears about the cruelty of stepmothers, at a time when mortality rates for child-bearing women were exceptionally high.\u201d That may be true. The Brothers Grimm revised their earliest version, changing the murderous mother to a murderous stepmother in the 1819 edition, possibly to lessen the impact and implications of the former.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/04/from-snow-white-to-cinderella-story-fairytales-film\">From Snow White to Cinderella, the story of fairytales on film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Playing with the taboo idea of an evil mother is more interesting today, when stepmothers have less control over children and it is more usual to have separated parents. So, too, is combating the overbearing prescription that motherhood should and must be sacrificial. Driving the Queen is fear: fear of ageing; fear of being rendered invisible; fear of competition, not to mention revolt against societal norms that dictate that the only legitimate feeling about offspring is unconditional love.</p> <p>All good fairytales expose societal anxieties. Remove the attempted filicide and La Boite\u2019s Snow White could be a more familiar story: one of a precocious teenager who rebels against her mother\u2019s hold to test the limits of her own sexuality; and of a mother who, watching her daughter grow up, suddenly feels the loss of her own allure.</p> <p><em>Snow White is on at La Boite \u2013 Roundhouse Theatre until 24 September. </em><em>Guardian Australia was a guest of Brisbane festival</em></p>",

Others prefer to separate the narrative and context and simply prefer to revel in the spectacle of it all \u2013 the elation, disappointment, crowds, blood, sweat and tears that come with a world-class event. Whatever your inclinations, we can all agree it has been a ruddy good Games. </p> <p><strong>Tonight, </strong>keep an eye out for<strong> </strong>Hannah Cockroft<strong> </strong>and GB team-mates Mel Nicholls and Kare Adenegan as they go for a gold-silver-bronze clean sweep in the T34 800m final in the Olympic Stadium. In the pool, we\u2019ve got a host of swimming finals to get your juices flowing as well as wheelchair fencing, basketball and tennis, where GB\u2019s Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid face each other in the singles final. The pair won silver earlier this week together, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/gb-alfie-hewett-gordon-reid-silver-wheelchair-doubles\">in the men\u2019s wheelchair doubles</a>.
