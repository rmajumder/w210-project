  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull supports a change in the law to allow same-sex couples to marry. But he does not believe in marriage equality.<br></p> <p>In the public debate these two concepts have been treated as the same but they are not. Let me explain, using Turnbull\u2019s own speech when he introduced legislation to set up the same-sex marriage plebiscite on Wednesday.</p> <p>Turnbull said: \u201cMy view and that of my wife, Lucy, is that the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry.\u201d That is a simple restatement of what Australians will be asked if the 11 February plebiscite goes ahead and the prime minister confirmed he would vote \u201cyes\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/16/malcolm-turnbull-willing-to-negotiate-on-marriage-equality-plebiscite\">Malcolm Turnbull willing to negotiate on marriage equality plebiscite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull went on: \u201cThe real reason, I think, many people oppose the plebiscite is because they believe that, if there were to be a free vote in the parliament, same-sex marriage would be supported, and so they do not want to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/marriage-equality-plebiscite-bill-appears-doomed-as-shorten-moves-to-block-it\">run the risk of the Australian people giving them the wrong answer</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFor our part, we put our faith in the Australian people and we know that their answer, whether it is yes or no, will be the right answer, because it is theirs.\u201d</p> <p>And here\u2019s where the distinction emerges. If Turnbull really believes that if the Australian people vote \u201cno\u201d that they have not got the wrong answer then he does not believe that the law as it stands \u2013 restricting marriage to a man and a woman \u2013 infringes the principle of equality. </p> <p>Someone who really believed in marriage equality, that marriage between two people regardless of sex is a right, would believe that were the Australian people to vote no in the plebiscite they would have got it wrong.<br></p> <p>In the US this is how same-sex marriage was legalised nationwide. In June 2015 the supreme court required all states to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples because to refuse to do so would violate the 14th amendment, which promises equality before the law. Australia has no such rights protection, which is why the law must be changed through a change to the Marriage Act.<br></p> <p>There is a word for believing that majorities are never wrong: majoritarianism. It\u2019s known as the tyranny of the majority because it allows the many to override the rights of the few. Majoritarianism is a particularly frightening thing in the context of LGBTI rights because there are so many more people that identify as heterosexual than lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex.</p> <p>Turnbull also said that he and Lucy: \u201cDo not believe that if same-sex couples are allowed to have their union recognised as marriage that will undermine our relationship of long standing.\u201d </p> <p>If you extend what Turnbull said in the case of his and Lucy\u2019s marriage to marriage generally \u2013 that gay marriage does not diminish other marriages \u2013 you start to see the problem of holding the plebiscite. Heterosexual people may refuse the right of others to marry, despite the fact gay marriage does not diminish heterosexual marriage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/qantas-ceo-alan-joyce-opposes-unnecessary-marriage-equality-plebiscite\">Qantas CEO Alan Joyce opposes 'unnecessary' marriage equality plebiscite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull has now told us that, if the plebiscite returned a no vote, he would accept the will of the voters. Interesting that he didn\u2019t do so after the Republic referendum, when he said the then prime minister, John Howard, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lg_laNhf_M\">had broken the nation\u2019s heart</a>. In that case, he stood for the principle that Australia should have an Australian head of state \u2013 in this case he does not stand for the principle of equality but rather majoritarianism.</p> <p>Arguably, parliament deciding the issue would be majoritarian as well because it\u2019s still up for a majority vote, just this time of our representatives. Maybe so. But parliamentarians have a responsibility to govern for all and are therefore more likely to consider whether same-sex marriage is so great a good for the group it affects (the dignity and equality it confers on LGBTI people) that it justifies some upset from those who feel it detracts from their own (heterosexual) marriage.</p> <p>So let\u2019s call a spade a spade. Turnbull wants same-sex couples to be able to marry but he does not believe they have a right to. If he believed they had a right to, he would not have said the Australian people <em>cannot</em> get this important decision wrong.</p>",

  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison got a nice first-year anniversary present this week when Australia recorded its best unemployment rate for three years. Oddly however, they both ignored the news and preferred to talk about the deal they made with Liberal party room on superannuation.</p> <p>When the ABS announced that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 5.6%, the lowest since July 2013 \u2013 that is at any time during the Abbott/Turnbull period of government \u2013 you would have expected the boasting to have been long and loud.</p> <p>And yet there was mostly silence.</p> <p>The employment minister Michaelia Cash gave a brief press conference, and during Senate question time after questions from her own side on superannuation, defence, innovation and science she was asked about the figures \u2013 not exactly it a high priority. </p> <p>Anyone who tuned into the House of Representatives question time, however, would have found nothing to enlighten them on the current state of the labour market. The prime minister was even given a nice broad question about the government\u2019s \u201ccommitment to deliver economic security for Australians\u201d. </p> <p>In his response, the closest he came to talking of the figures was to note that \u201cjobs are growing\u201d. </p> <p>That at least was closer than the treasurer came to mentioning the good figures. All Morrison wanted to talk about was the changes to the superannuation system. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/australias-unemployment-rate-reaches-lowest-level-in-three-years\">Australia's unemployment rate reaches lowest level in three years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The closest anyone came to talking about the actual situation of jobs was Christopher Pyne <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F9de5f081-9ccf-4f72-a05a-02462c1f3a0c%2F0114%22\">who told parliament</a> that \u201cwe created over 200,000 jobs in the last 12 months\u201d (it was actually 191,000 in trend terms or 180,000 in seasonally adjusted, so not quite 200,000 let alone \u201cover\u201d). </p> <p>In both houses the big issue was the changes to superannuation. </p> <p>The lack of attention on actual unemployment highlights the triumph of the \u201cbudget is the economy\u201d argument, where anything that reduces the budget deficit is considered an inherent good. </p> <p>It also highlights that despite the impressive overall unemployment rate, the employment situation is not that good.</p> <p>Malcolm Turnbull suggested that \u201cjobs are growing\u201d, but mostly it is part-time jobs that are growing and even overall job growth is slowing dramatically.</p> <p>Last year in the first eight months 191,000 jobs were created; this year it is just 83,900. The situation for full-time work is particularly bad \u2013 there are now 21,000 fewer full-time jobs than there were in December. </p> <p>And August also saw a record set for the level of underemployed workers. </p> <p>So it is no surprise really that the government was happy to focus on superannuation reforms which reduce the budget deficit. </p> <p>And what was the upshot of these reforms? </p> <p>The prime minister noted that 96% of people would be better off or unaffected. Among of those who will \u201cbenefit\u201d are low-income earners who will profit from the government replacing the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing/Low-income-super-contribution/\">low income super contribution</a>,\u201d which is worth up to $500 a year with the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Super/Introducing-a-Low-Income-Superannuation-Tax-Offset/\">low income superannuation tax offset</a>,\u201d which is worth up to ... err ... $500 a year.</p> <p>And just how adversely affected the remaining 4% will be is up for debate. </p> <p>The high-income-earner-friendly Australian Financial Review headlined an article on the policy with \u201cWealthy are the winners in Coalition\u2019s superannuation deal\u201d. It also led another article explaining what the \u201cchanges mean for you\u201d by noting that \u201cwealthy savers were granted a last chance to stash up to $540,000 from after-tax earnings before the end of the financial year\u201d.</p> <p>So you would be right in wondering just how big a hair cut the very wealthy will be having. </p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that the savings to the budget are estimated to be roughly $3bn over the next four years. That sounds big until you realise Treasury estimates the amount of revenue foregone through superannuation tax concessions is around $140bn over that same period. </p> <p>And the changes to the policy \u2013 which among other things saw a backflip on the proposal to impose a $500,000 lifetime limit on post-tax contributions \u2013 was not arrived at though some great bipartisan negotiation. The negotiation was all within the Liberal party room and effectively involved giving the disgruntled and very emboldened rightwing of the party room what it wanted. </p> <p>The ALP will pass the changes \u2013 there is no reason not to \u2013 and there will be many a story about backflips or good deal-making, and others about how the government is at least making steps to improve the budget, and how important and good that is. </p> <p>The government for the most part will welcome such stories \u2013 for they will spin the narrative as best they can. And better those stories than focussing on how for the employment situation looks a lots less buoyant than it was 12 months ago when Turnbull took office.</p>",

It is and has been a really tricky situation,\u201d Mohammed said.</p> <p>He added that negotiations under Jonathan did not start until a year after the 276 girls were captured from a school in Chibok, north-east Nigeria, making it more difficult for Buhari. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very testy matter because these divisions in Boko Haram are constantly shifting. But we inherited this situation and we are concentrating on rescuing the girls.\u201d</p> <p>Buhari\u2019s government was thought to be attempting to rescue the girls.

Over the phone, Sinclair and Blichfeld say that they\u2019ve been answering the same question a lot of late, one that possibly vocalises their own chief preoccupation of the past year \u2013 is High Maintenance going to be different now that it\u2019s on HBO?</p> <p>Sinclair, who writes, directs and plays \u201cthe guy\u201d, says that the challenge was to maintain the tightness that made the web series so irresistible and addictive. \u201cOur primary duty this year as we experienced it was to maintain that intimacy,\u201d he says, \u201cand sometimes it felt like it was an uphill battle.\u201d Blichfeld agrees, saying that they succeeded in keeping it intimate within the bigger production by choosing \u201cto remain the sole creatives on this show\u201d.</p> <p>They kept the cast small and continued to shoot in tiny apartments around New York in spite of the 50-man crew, the chief difference now being that everyone was getting paid and that they could hire a second apartment for the spillover. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning as film-makers and we\u2019re always trying to stretch ourselves to see how we can tell stories in even more interesting ways,\u201d Sinclair says, stressing that it\u2019s not all about looking back however.</p> <p>New York\u2019s apartments in all their odd sizes, shapes and locations continue to be obsessed over in the new series, with objects and decorations acting as visual aids to enrich the story and character development. In the new episodes a cereal bowl left on the coffee table until nightfall warns of approaching tears and the home gym equipment brandished in the living room spells a particular type of trouble. Sinclair and Blichfeld have spoken about writing scripts based on the spaces they had at their disposal, and in spite of no longer having budget restrictions, High Maintenance benefits from this approach they haven\u2019t been able to shake off. Each new episode has the thrill of a one-night stand, offering a momentary insight into a stranger\u2019s mind and personality through the interior of their home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6baf282be2619dd4e6f9db49bbb163b3cf045d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6baf282be2619dd4e6f9db49bbb163b3cf045d0/0_173_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A-holes?

Helene Yorke and Max Jenkins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Russell/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If restrictions proved to be the mother of invention, what is their creative approach now? \u201cWe still have restrictions, believe it or not, because the expectation is different,\u201d Blichfeld says, \u201cbecause we\u2019re not following a core cast of characters we can just keep building on. It\u2019s almost like every episode is a mini movie, a short film, a little pilot. It\u2019s still a challenge to come up with that multiple worlds for that 30-minute block.\u201d </p> <p>Previously these multiple worlds were inspired by a friend\u2019s quirk or an actor\u2019s personality, with Blichfeld and Sinclair often suiting the form and writing to the artist they were working with. (The writing that was so informed by restrictions last year won Sinclair and Blichfeld a prestigious Writer\u2019s Guild award for the episode entitled Rachel.) HBO the canvas is wider and blanker, and Sinclair says that the previous episodes put them under pressure too. \u201cWe\u2019ll think of an idea but now we have 19 episodes filled with some version of that idea that we may be recycling or we might not be recycling, so there\u2019s all the constraints of what we\u2019ve already done before on top of all these new ideas.\u201d Then he rallies, \u201cBut we are going to surprise you every episode and give you wallop.\u201d</p> <p>High Maintenance\u2019s portrayal of Brooklyn bohemia manages to eschew any irritation or offence that the much maligned and too often badly portrayed subject might cause. Blichfeld seems to think that \u201cnot everyone would agree with that\u201d but says that they try to never \u201cplay the judgment of things out\u201d. In spite of depicting characters like vegetarians who don\u2019t want to kill a mouse in their house or an engaged couple who become urban \u2018preppers\u2019, each episode subverts and defies expectations, removing it from any possible stereotype. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to be observational or presentational and not trying to play a message,\u201d Blichfeld says. \u201cWe\u2019re not making fun of people.\u201d They don\u2019t draw any eye-rolls according to Sinclair, because like someone on Twitter said to him during the week, \u201cHigh Maintenance shows people at their best and their worst\u2019 and maybe that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get at.\u201d</p> <p>The new episodes have built upon the earlier ones seamlessly, as though the only discernable difference between HBO and Vimeo were the money and the size of the crew. Sinclair and Blichfeld say they were given complete creative control. In the new six episodes there\u2019s more interconnective tissue between the stories and character development and backstory play a bigger role, like in the case of Max from the web series (known to previous HM fans as the guy saved as \u201cAsshole\u201d in \u2018the guy\u2019s\u2019 phone after he steals a bag of weed). There\u2019s a good mixture of returning favourites (Dan Stevens and Hannibal Buress are back) new arrivals, such as the surprising four-legged protagonist of the third episode, and things seem to have sexed up across the boards perhaps to fill that 11pm slot. \u201cThe guy\u201d may also have a new bike.</p> <p>High Maintenance remains a hit of pure unadulterated joy, its deft characterizations and presentational comedy retaining the same surefootedness it had when it inhabited the purer space of a web series. It\u2019s move to HBO will not harm it or lose it its cult following. Bigger and just as bold, Sinclair and Blichfeld have succeeded in retaining the poignancy and gentleness that counters the sharp observational humour throughout.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately we\u2019re about people and pot is a way into people,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cAnd we like pot.\u201d</p>",

He and Stein, however, fell well short of the 15% national polling average required to participate. </p> <p>Johnson immediately accused the CPD of attempting to \u201csilence the candidate preferred by \u2026 millions of Americans\u201d.</p> <p>To take part in the debates candidates must achieve ballot access in enough states to win an electoral majority and have averaged more than 15% in five selected opinion polls. The CPD\u2019s polling averages were Hillary Clinton (43%), Donald Trump (40.4%), Gary Johnson (8.4%) and Jill Stein (3.2%).</p> <p>Clinton and Trump will therefore be the only candidates to take part in the first debate, at Hofstra University on 26 September. </p> <p>Johnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, will not take part in the vice-presidential debate, which will be contested by Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Mike Pence at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia on 4 October.</p> <p>Johnson and Stein could still qualify to appear in the second and third presidential debates, on 9 October at Washington University in St Louis and on 19 October at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. The CPD said the 15% standard would be reapplied closer to those dates.<br></p> <p>Johnson has said it will be \u201cgame over\u201d for his campaign if he does not make the presidential debates, two more of which follow the opener at Hofstra. He has been <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">averaging around 8%</a> in national polling, but believes the debates could help him reach a much wider audience.<br></p> <p>In a statement released on Friday, he said: \u201cThe CPD may scoff at a ticket that enjoys \u2018only\u2019 9% or 10% in their hand-selected polls, but even 9% represents 13 million voters, more than the total population of Ohio and most other states. </p> <p>\u201cYet, the Republicans and Democrats are choosing to silence the candidate preferred by those millions of Americans.\u201d<br></p> <p>Johnson has been critical of the debate selection process, arguing that the criteria for candidates to make the stage is skewed in favor of Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>\u201cI would say I am surprised that the CPD has chosen to exclude me from the first debate,\u201d he said on Friday, \u201cbut I\u2019m not. After all, the commission is a private organization created 30 years ago by the Republican and Democratic parties for the clear purpose of taking control of the only nationally televised presidential debates voters will see. </p> <p>\u201cAt the time of its creation, the leaders of those two parties made no effort to hide the fact that they didn\u2019t want any third-party intrusions into their shows.\u201d</p> <p>In September 2015 Johnson and Stein <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/29/libertarian-and-green-parties-sue-commission-presi/\">filed a lawsuit</a> against the CPD, arguing that candidates be included if they are on the ballot in enough states to have a chance of securing 270 electoral college votes and are eligible to serve.

  "<p>Donald Trump on Friday named one of the nation\u2019s top anti-abortion activists to his campaign coalition, in the clearest signal yet that the presidential candidate has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/17/restricting-abortion-republican-controlled-congress\">fully embraced Republicans\u2019 typically harsh stance against abortion</a>.</p> <p>Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B Anthony List, a group that works to elect Republican, anti-abortion women, will chair the loose coalition of conservative, anti-abortion rights leaders who are working to elect the Republican nominee. Trump\u2019s campaign also announced that he would commit to a law banning public funding of abortion.</p> <p>The appointment is a sharp about-face for both Dannenfelser, formerly one of Trump\u2019s most vocal critics, and the Republican presidential nominee. Although he has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">espoused harsh anti-abortion positions</a>, Trump has nevertheless spent much of the campaign out of step with the anti-abortion establishment \u2013 praising Planned Parenthood and, conversely, calling for the punishment of women who have abortions illegally. </p> <p>In response, anti-abortion groups have sometimes accused Trump of being ignorant of their positions. </p> <p>On Friday, Dannenfelser signaled that her group considered Trump\u2019s policies to be wholly in line with the anti-abortion movement\u2019s priorities. Trump \u201cdoubled down [on his] commitments to the pro-life movement\u201d, Dannenfelser said. \u201cThe contrast could not be clearer between the two tickets, and I am proud to serve as national chairwoman for Donald Trump\u2019s pro-life coalition.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement is a further sign that Trump has succeeded in wooing social conservatives who once viewed the Manhattan real estate magnate with suspicion and chimes with his choice of Mike Pence, governor of Indiana, as his running mate. The former congressman is credited with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/mike-pence-republicans-defund-planned-parenthood-abortion\">drawing up the blueprint for the Republican party\u2019s crusade against Planned Parenthood</a>. </p> <p>Trump has only recently claimed to oppose abortion. In 1999, in his last public statement on abortion before he flirted with a presidential run, Trump proclaimed himself to be \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d. He first declared he was \u201cpro-life\u201d in 2011 at an annual conservative confab.</p> <p>During the Republican primaries, Dannenfelser was one of the loudest voices to oppose Trump, calling on Iowa caucus-goers in a January <a href=\"https://www.sba-list.org/home/pro-life-women-sound-the-alarmdonald-trump-is-unacceptable\">letter</a> to \u201csupport anyone but Donald Trump\u201d. \u201cWe are disgusted by Mr Trump\u2019s treatment of individuals, women, in particular,\u201d the letter read. \u201cTrump \u2026 has through the years made disparaging public comments to and about many women.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92a130ab512f8f7cd51153936612a3b4f12195dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92a130ab512f8f7cd51153936612a3b4f12195dd/0_71_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reproductive rights groups immediately condemned Marjorie Dannenfelser\u2019s addition to Trump\u2019s campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reproductive rights groups immediately condemned Marjorie Dannenfelser\u2019s addition to Trump\u2019s campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her comments came as Trump repeatedly equivocated on abortion rights and one of the anti-abortion movement\u2019s most cherished goals, the federal defunding of Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>A little more than a year ago, Trump said he could not commit to defunding Planned Parenthood without weighing whether the group was \u201cgood for women\u201d.

In April, he further angered anti-abortion groups by saying he believed abortion should remain legal. \u201cThe laws are set,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we have to leave it that way.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/mike-pence-republicans-defund-planned-parenthood-abortion\">How Mike Pence wrote the Republican Planned Parenthood attack playbook</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His campaign in both cases quickly sought to undercut his comments, claiming the candidate believed in punishment only for abortion providers and saying Trump would appoint anti-abortion nominees to the supreme court.</p> <p>In Friday\u2019s announcement, Trump committed for the first time to signing the Hyde amendment into law. The amendment is an annual budget rider that prohibits federal Medicaid funding from paying for abortion services. Making the amendment law is the strictest position Trump has staked out on abortion funding, although it is not surprising.

  "<p>A Davis Cup semi-final that began in nervous anticipation ended with heightened anxiety for Great Britain, who enter the second day 2-0 down and looking to a beaten, exhausted Andy Murray to rescue the cause in the doubles alongside his brother, Jamie, the day after their grandfather\u2019s funeral.</p> <p>When Kyle Edmund, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/17/davis-cup-great-britain-serbia-tennis\" title=\"\">the hero of the Belgrade quarter-final victory</a> over Serbia in the absence of the world No2, failed to tame Guido Pella on Friday evening, the British bench and the rest of the stadium was littered with battered spirits.

The Scot struck 35 of them, nine more than his previous best at the US Open in 2005, and it appeared as if he were striving for the most direct route to the finish line near the end of a long, successful but tough summer, as his first-serve success dipped to a disappointing 52%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/16/andy-murray-davis-cup-juan-martin-del-potro-tennis-match-report\" title=\"\">If, after losing the longest match of his 11-year career</a>, Murray can summon up two more momentous efforts this weekend to go with the many others he has conjured over the years for himself and the team, he will deserve the freedom of every city in the country \u2013 and not just his native Scotland.</p> <p>Great Britain\u2019s captain, Leon Smith, surely has to gamble on the oversized heart of the nation\u2019s best player, and then ask him to go one mile further in the reverse singles on Sunday. Smith said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of good days. But I guess at some point, especially where we are in the world group, playing against great teams, some days will be like that.

I will check in with him when we get back.\u201d There is no logical alternative. Murray has carried the team for years; if asked, he will find it difficult to decline, but before the Edmund result, he was unsure.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said in a press conference notable for the shortness of his answers. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see how I am when I wake up. I will probably make a decision then. If I recover OK, I\u2019ll be the favourite to win on Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>The tennis is not all he had to deal with. The brothers\u2019 paternal grandfather, Gordon, died last week, and Jamie missed Friday\u2019s matches to attend the funeral. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard,\u201d admitted Andy, who spent time with that side of the family earlier in the week, \u201cbut I always planned on playing.\u201d</p> <p>Murray, born just five miles from the arena on the other side of Glasgow 29 years ago, wanted a win over Del Potro as much as he did when he beat the Argentinian for the sixth time in eight contests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/no-respite-for-drained-andy-murray-after-claiming-historic-olympic-tennis-gold\" title=\"\">to win his second Olympic gold medal in Rio</a> only a month ago. However, there was no denying the big man, who won 6-4, 5-7, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 in five hours and seven minutes, exactly an hour longer than their Brazilian epic. \u201cIt\u2019s very fine margins,\u201d Murray said.</p> <p>\u201cThat happens in tennis, happens in sport some times. It could have gone either way. He just played a little bit better in the fifth set.\u201d</p> <p>It was high-grade attrition from the first game, which took Murray nine minutes to win, to the final thrusts and blocks and screams of delight and anguish of the fifth set. The 8,000 present in a setting that might have been constructed for the very purpose of generating hostile decibels received the winner with the sort of respect normally reserved for one of their own \u2013 especially this one of their own.</p> <p>The adopted hero of the day, though, was Del Potro, who left as much on court as did the vanquished Murray. There is something immensely likeable about Del Potro, who has a face like a boy and a forehand that might have been forged in hell.

They should not have ordered the terrified youth into the water and \u201ccould and should\u201d have rescued him as he floundered. Though cleared of manslaughter by a court martial, they bear moral responsibility for his death. But they do not bear it alone.</p> <p>Soldiers were expected to control the looting \u2013 but never told how, still less trained to do so. As the occupying power in south-east Iraq, Britain was responsible for maintaining law and order. The Chilcot inquiry disclosed that the joint intelligence committee and defence intelligence staff had warned of the danger of mass lawlessness; and that Tony Blair and the Ministry of Defence recognised the seriousness of the risk. Yet the chief of the defence staff issued no instructions, even when pressed on the issue twice by the chief of joint operations.</p> <p>As the scale of the problem became clear, overwhelmed troops in Basra were actively instructed not to use arrest as the standard response, a soldier told the hearing \u2013 but they received only limited guidance on alternatives. Platoons developed ad hoc methods of dealing with offenders. That they included pushing looters into water was no secret, as witnesses made clear.</p> <p>Ahmed\u2019s death is traceable to the original sin: the secrecy and lack of planning in the run-up to the invasion, laid bare by the Chilcot report. The consequences were entirely predictable. British troops died because they were ill-equipped and ill-prepared and Iraqi lives were even cheaper, being barely noticed. Sir John Chilcot found that more time was spent deciding which department should have responsibility for calculating Iraqi civilian deaths than finding out the actual number.</p> <p>The MoD has finally said sorry for the teenager\u2019s death and has promised to use Sir&#xa0;George\u2019s findings to ensure such cases do not occur again. We should not count on that. These hearings have happened only because the families of victims and their lawyers fought hard and persistently for proper investigation. There is a long and inglorious history of abuses by British troops being first denied, then dismissed as the work of a few bad apples, and finally, much later and after sustained pressure, acknowledged as far broader problems and, perhaps, apologised for. Often the truth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/kenyan-94-testifies-killings-british-soldiers-munyaka-mau-mau\" title=\"\">emerges after decades</a>.</p> <p>By these standards, the current inquiries are timely. But 13 years is still too long to wait for a detailed accounting of your child\u2019s death, and Ahmed\u2019s family should not have to wait any longer for a fuller explanation of the forces behind it. Sir George has already said he is likely to investigate what happened at a policy level and in high command. Everything possible should be done to encourage and facilitate that, not only for families like Ahmed\u2019s, but also because it is the only way to prevent such abuses in the future.</p>",

May\u2019s reforms also narrowed any home secretary\u2019s discretion to intervene in such highly charged cases.</p> <p>Love\u2019s home was initially raided by National Crime Agency officers in October 2013. Asked why it had not prosecuted Love in the UK under the Computer Misuse Act, the National Crime Agency confirmed that it had never sent a full file of evidence on Love to the Crown Prosecution Service.</p> <p>Sarah Harrison, director of the Courage Foundation, which runs Love\u2019s defence fund and support campaign, said: \u201cThis is a very disappointing ruling, not just for Lauri and his family but for everyone who was angry about what happened to Gary McKinnon. <br></p> <p>\u201cClear assurances were given that legal changes would prevent the McKinnon situation from happening again and frankly, if the forum bar can\u2019t help Lauri Love, it\u2019s very difficult to understand how it could ever help anyone. This is not what the public was led to believe at the time and it\u2019s not something we should stand for.\u201d</p> <p>Bella Sankey, director of policy for Liberty, said: \u201cWhere unlawful activity is alleged to have taken place in the UK, those suspected should be tried on UK soil \u2013 especially in cases of vulnerable people like Lauri Love.</p> <p>\u201cGary McKinnon\u2019s case rightly led to a change in the law which aimed to stop extraditions in cases like this. If that new law cannot be interpreted in a way which does that, the law needs changing again.\u201d</p> <p>Among the US agencies and firms Love is alleged to have targeted in his cyber-attacks are the US Federal Reserve, US army, US Department of Defense, Missile Defense Agency, Nasa, army corps of engineers, Department of Health and Human Services, US Sentencing Commission, FBI regional computer forensics laboratory, Deltek Inc, Department of Energy and Forte Interactive Inc.</p> <p>Love, who describes himself as a political activist, is accused of stealing personal information and disseminating it online, causing, according to Tempia\u2019s judgment, \u201cmillions of dollars worth of damage\u201d. He has denied exaggerating the severity of his medical condition.</p> <p>One positive point from the judgment is that the issue of Love\u2019s health was acknowledged. The court found that he is at high and severe risk of suicide because of his serious conditions.</p>",
  "<p>All political parties contain contradictions, but few are as confused about their purpose as Ukip. The party was founded in opposition&#xa0;to European integration and evolved into a less coherent nationalistic protest movement. On that journey, hostility towards \u201cBrussels\u201d has served as a sanitising agent, lending mainstream propriety to an organisation in which anxiety about a loss of identity sometimes merges with outright racism. The adhesive quality of Euroscepticism is weaker now that Britain has a prime minister committed to Brexit. It&#xa0;is&#xa0;far from clear that Diane James, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live\" title=\"\">Ukip\u2019s new leader</a>, is capable of restoring the insurgent energy that gave the party such momentum in the pre-referendum years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/ukip-elects-diane-james-as-new-party-leader\">Ukip elects Diane James as new party leader</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ms James <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/diane-james-profile-crumbling-ukip-safe-pair-of-hands\" title=\"\">ran a cautious campaign</a>, eschewing policy and avoiding debate. In presentational terms she was the slickest candidate; she appealed to members who want a more professional organisation. Nigel Farage shared but never achieved that objective, partly because of his narcissistic character and partly because of the nature of the movement he had built. Beyond the European question, there is a tension in Ukip between an ambition to be respectable and a wilful embrace of maverick identity that rejects \u201cestablishment\u201d notions of respectability. This problem was encapsulated in Mr Farage\u2019s problematic relationship with parliament, denouncing it as a den of corruption while desperately trying to win a seat there. The Faragist platform resonated widely enough to give Ukip <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/09/margate-ukip-greens-electoral-reform-farage\" title=\"\">a double-digit share</a> of the national vote without ever electing him an MP.</p> <p>That is a technical obstacle of the Westminster voting system, but it expresses also Mr Farage\u2019s failure to reassure mainstream voters that his claims to abhor racism were sincere. Ukip\u2019s only MP, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/10/ukip-wins-clacton-first-parliamentary-seat-douglas-carswell\" title=\"\">Douglas Carswell</a>, first won his seat when badged as a Tory, and he espouses an internationalist libertarianism that can share a tent with Ukip\u2019s anti-immigration, nativist tendency only if both sides agree to pretend they are compatible. That pretence is breaking down. Mr Carswell would look more at home rejoining the Conservatives. He is not alone. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/nigel-farage-aide-says-ukip-supporters-have-flocked-to-tories\" title=\"\">Alexandra Phillips</a>, Ukip\u2019s former head of media, told the Guardian today that she has joined the Tories and claimed that tens of thousands of Ukip members had done the same. Mrs May\u2019s commitment to Brexit, grammar schools and immigration control appear to have made her party once again a&#xa0;natural home for those who defected to Ukip in horror at David Cameron\u2019s dalliances with more liberal conservatism.</p> <p>Even before the Brexit vote, Mr Farage said that his party had reached the limits of growth available by recruiting disgruntled Tories. He envisaged future advances being made in Labour seats in the Midlands, the north of England and Wales. Many Labour MPs, witnessing the receptivity of their core voters to anti-EU messages during the referendum campaign, fear a challenge from Ukip could trigger a collapse of their heartland support. Ms James inherits an organisational shambles where the leading figures hate one another. Her first move was to stop the party\u2019s leader in Wales, the ex-Tory MP Neil Hamilton, from addressing conference. She has the notional support of Mr Farage, but only after his first-choice candidate, immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/31/ukip-leadership-favourite-steven-woolfe-legal-action-excluded\" title=\"\">excluded from the ballot</a> on technical grounds that supporters believe were trumped up and motivated by factional spite. The outgoing leader may not relinquish the limelight to which he has become so obviously addicted.</p> <p>Anyone who judges Ukip\u2019s influence in British politics to have been pernicious \u2013 laundering xenophobia with the ideological detergent of Euroscepticism \u2013 may enjoy seeing it consumed by factional bickering. But institutional malaise must not be confused with abeyance of the force Ukip represented. Brexit cannot satisfy many of those who voted to leave the EU because EU membership was not the root of their dissatisfaction. The drivers of Faragism \u2013 economic insecurity and disorientation connected to the pace of globalisation \u2013 will remain. The capacity of Mrs May\u2019s government to address them while bogged down in complex European negotiations, will be limited. A period of Ukip disarray still creates an opportunity for the Tories and Labour to reconnect with disillusioned supporters who have been lending protest votes to Ukip. That will not be easy, but the moment must be seized quickly. It may not last long.</p>",
  "<p>When Donald Trump went to Flint, Michigan, on Wednesday in his first visit to the city since lead was detected in the water in 2014, he began, inappropriately enough, with a joke.</p> <p>\u201cIt used to be cars were made in Flint, and you couldn\u2019t drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can\u2019t drink the water in Flint,\u201d Trump said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/donald-trump-flint-visit-water-plant-tour\">Flint residents bristle at Donald Trump's visit to beleaguered city</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his appearance at a Methodist church Wednesday, Trump added that the lead poisoning \u201cwould have never happened if I were president\u201d. On the contrary: under a president Trump, what happened in Flint could happen everywhere. It would be the inevitable outcome of what is quite possibly the only Trump policy we can be sure of: radical deregulation.</p> <p>Look at what happened in Flint in the 1980s: when nearly all of General Motors\u2019 plants in the city were either deemed to be noncompliant or flagged for potential noncompliance with EPA regulations, GM started closing its plants rather than face increasing labor and cleanup costs, according to <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/26/11117022/flint-michigan-water-crisis-lead-pollution-history\">an investigation</a> into the source of the Flint water contamination by the Verge. (Industry is not to blame for the whole water-poisoning debacle, but neither is it innocent.)<br></p> <p>Local officials were more worried about saving money than protecting the safety of Flint residents. But they didn\u2019t poison the water to begin with \u2013 a whole structural array of forces did, including Trump\u2019s beloved private sector dumping untreated waste.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the best check on the kind of gross state and local government mismanagement that we saw in Michigan is the EPA. The problem in Flint was not what the EPA did; it\u2019s what it didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s that the EPA was by an order of magnitude far too weak and inactive.<br></p> <p>As Joel Beauvais, head of the agency\u2019s water office put it in <a href=\"http://www.clickondetroit.com/live/watch-live-house-oversight-committee-holds-hearing-on-flint-water-crisis\">his testimony</a> before the House Oversight Committee earlier this year, the EPA urged local authorities to address the lack of corrosion control in Flint\u2019s water, \u201cBut (the EPA) encountered resistance.\u201d</p> <p>If Trump had his way, the agency would be <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-says-hed-eliminate-department-of-environment-protection/article/2584908\">gutted</a> entirely. And that gets to the heart of what\u2019s so terrifying about a potential Trump presidency.</p> <p>Set aside the outlandish racism \u2013 the calls to build a wall on the border and seize oil in the Middle East \u2013 and his campaign is still in essence a Mitt Romney-esque embrace of right-wing deregulation.</p> <p>He\u2019s not trying to hide that fact. After leaving Flint, he turned around the very next day to condemn the EPA\u2019s Clean Water Rule in a speech in New York Thursday, and earlier this year, Trump lackey Chris Christie discussed Trump\u2019s desire to fire federal workers at the EPA and other regulatory agencies, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/trump-hopes-to-purge-civil-service-of-democrats.html\">replacing them with CEOs</a>.</p> <p>As New York magazine <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/trump-hopes-to-purge-civil-service-of-democrats.html\">noted at the time</a>, \u201cIn Trump\u2019s America, progressives won\u2019t have to worry about former banking executives regulating their old colleagues \u2014 active CEOs will be doing that for their current ones.\u201d (You might replace \u201cprogressives\u201d with any old human worried about being poisoned.)</p> <p>Perhaps Christie\u2019s own abysmal record on clean water is worth mentioning as well. He recently vetoed a bill aimed at protecting children from lead poisoning in a cost-cutting measure that protects his budget, uncannily similar to the cardinal sin of local officials in Flint. Under Christie\u2019s administration, environmental inspections and enforcements have been slashed by at least 60%, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2016/02/flint_can_happen_in_nj_with_christie_siding_with_water_polluters_opinion.html\">according to</a> the New Jersey Star-Ledger. </p> <p>But let\u2019s keep the focus on Trump. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin\">the John Doe papers</a> leaked in the Guardian this week, Trump donated to the third-party group of a special prosecutor accused of coordinating with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\u2019s recall campaign along with, guess who? The head of a lead paint company facing millions in lawsuits from poisoned residents.</p> <p>Walker would later sign off on legislation granting effective immunity to the lead paint industry (the law was later <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/election-matters/report-scott-walker-wisconsin-club-for-growth-received-support-from/article_b805be8e-b7f7-5b07-a7a6-682e1f4847f8.html\">blocked</a> by a federal court). And though Trump was not directly involved with that issue, he was broadly on their side of the political battle, donating $15,000 to the group at the center of the investigation. As in Flint, the population most affected was poor children.</p> <p>Defunding federal regulatory agencies like the EPA is simply easier to do as the country\u2019s chief executive than anything else Trump is proposing \u2013 Congress is <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/245137-house-panel-approves-3017b-bill-to-cut-epa-funds-block-climate\">already halfway there</a>. The upshot is the most tangible policy behind the plan to make America Great Again at this point is to let America\u2019s kids be poisoned, again. The proof is looking at us in Flint.</p>",

Until he died a lot of them did not know he refused to fight in the Vietnam War and was squeezed out of boxing for more than three years in the prime of his career because of it. Hearing of how he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/commentisfree/2016/jun/05/muhammad-ali-gary-younge-tribute\" title=\"\">stood up to racial oppression</a> opened their eyes. \u201cMany of them have started to ask, how will I be judged years from now?\u201d Neal said.</p> <p>Things were different in the years after Ali first spoke about race. Black athletes were emboldened to protest in those days and often did. The former NBA star Marques Johnson, who now Milwaukee Bucks games on television, remembers that his college coach at UCLA, John Wooden, had the team stay in the locker room for the national anthem because he knew most of the players would not stand for the song.</p> <p>\u201cWe were aware of [the anthem author] Francis Scott Key being a racist,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe knew about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/04/star-spangled-banner-national-anthem-british-origins\" title=\"\">the missing third stanza</a> that criticises the slaves who joined the British Army so they could be free. I think we were aware of all of that.\u201d</p> <p>But something happened in the following years. The players who were moved to protest also saw how wealthy NBA stars were becoming. They noticed how Julius Erving, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/apr/20/ussport.news1\" title=\"\">better known as Dr J</a>, was celebrated for his clean-cut, corporate image and they wanted to be more like him. Their zeal for protest waned. Speaking out became a sin. Once, in the early 1980s, Johnson had become so tired of hearing the media complain that the NBA was losing popularity because it did not have enough white stars, he bought a Halloween mask of a white man that he was going to wear during warm-ups before a game. Eventually he lost his nerve. He worried that it would affect his contract negotiations.</p> <p>Now he wonders if the current athletes have become so wealthy they feel empowered to speak out: Kaepernick, he notes, is well into a contract that guarantees him $60m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee54d1d696c81db54521ae59d91906cc38ca1eaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee54d1d696c81db54521ae59d91906cc38ca1eaf/0_88_2997_1798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muhammad Ali punches Ken Norton in the face\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many of Kaepernick\u2019s critics extolled the virtues of Muhammad Ali in the wake of the boxer\u2019s death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anonymous/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen you have that kind of financial clout behind you those are some pretty good chips to fall back on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a part of that is the more financially comfortable you are means you have the means to take a stand and address some social ills.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/09/protests-national-anthems-sporting-events-colin-kaepernick\">Protests call into question need to play national anthems at sporting events | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s most alarming is that many of the same voices who extolled Ali on his death in June are Kaepernick\u2019s most strident critics.

  "<p>Donald Trump on Friday attempted to resolve an issue that is thought to have caused him significant damage with minority voters by admitting that Barack Obama was born in the US after years of promoting false claims that the US president was born in Kenya. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-movement-election-live\">Trump finally admits Obama was born in the US \u2013 campaign live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Republican presidential candidate continued to falsely claim that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy theory. </p> <p>Speaking in the presidential ballroom of his new luxury hotel in Washington, Trump boasted about his new establishment, trotted out over a half-dozen generals to fawn over him and then almost casually remarked that he now thinks the president was born in the US, before walking swiftly away in what bore more resemblance to a dog and pony show than a campaign event.</p> <p>Trump finally said the words \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period\u201d after <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/05/05/fact-check-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-birther-movement-obama/83968036/\">falsely blaming</a> Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign for starting the rumor, an accusation that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/06/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-that-hillary-clinton-started-the-birther-movement/?tid=a_inl\">the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker called</a> \u201cridiculous\u201d.</p> <p>Although Trump\u2019s campaign released a statement on the topic last night, the Republican nominee had never publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the US.</p> <p>Trump had long fanned the flames of this conspiracy theory, known as \u201cbirtherism\u201d.

After five years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory into the mainstream, it was appalling to watch Trump appoint himself the judge of whether the President of the United States is American.</p> <p>\u201cThis sickening display shows more than ever why Donald Trump is totally unfit be president.\u201d</p> <p>When asked about Trump\u2019s views on his birthplace earlier in the day, Obama told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m shocked that a question like that has come up at a time when we have so many other things to do.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not that shocked actually.

My hope would be the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>US lawmakers have voiced hopes that the ailing Everglades will start to recover after the Senate overwhelmingly approved a nearly $2bn measure to combat the toxic algae blooms that have devastated Florida\u2019s waterways.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Missions/Environmental/Ecosystem-Restoration/Central-Everglades-Planning-Project/\">Central Everglades Planning Project</a>, touted by proponents as landmark legislation, passed the Senate on Thursday as part of a broader $10bn water resources bill by a vote of 95-3. The series of engineering projects are designed to collect water around Lake Okeechobee and channel it south to nourish the Everglades wetlands, America\u2019s largest tropical wilderness, rather than have it run off into the ocean.</p> <p>Housing and agricultural development has transformed the Everglades region and its natural water flow in recent years. Diverted water, often laced with nutrients from fertilizer, has recently caused toxic algal blooms in Florida waterways and beaches. The Everglades, deprived of this natural flow, is also threatened by sea level rise and invasive species. </p> <p>Florida lawmakers who were instrumental in pushing for the Everglades restoration hailed Thursday\u2019s development as a major obstacle overcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ba7ea83653d50658d6d7ff6552abba4ca15b11d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba7ea83653d50658d6d7ff6552abba4ca15b11d/0_0_1321_2247/588.jpg\" alt=\"florida everglades\" width=\"588\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map of Florida Everglades.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Everglades Planning Project</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a huge victory,\u201d said Florida senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat. \u201cThis project will enable us to take a significant step forward in restoring the natural water flow to a water-starved Everglades national park.\u201d</p> <p>Marco Rubio, Florida\u2019s other senator, said the project was \u201cthe single largest thing that\u2019s gotten done\u201d on the issue.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been tied up in this long-term morass, and it doesn\u2019t solve every problem, but it\u2019s the single biggest Everglades restoration project that Congress has finally made progress on,\u201d the former Republican presidential candidate told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cYou can start to see where we\u2019ll be in a decade or less, and it\u2019s a much better place than the Everglades and its surrounding communities are today.\u201d</p> <p>Nelson and Rubio were early co-sponsors of legislation to advance the Central Everglades Planning Project and have routinely emphasized the urgency of the issue. Rubio also persuaded Jim Inhofe, the chairman of the environment and public works committee that crafted the overall water bill, to back the project and reverse his longstanding opposition to Everglades restoration.</p> <p>Inhofe, a Republican senator from Oklahoma who in 2000 was the lone senator to vote against Everglades funding, explained his change of heart in an <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article100711007.html\">op-ed for the Miami Herald</a> that also cited the degradation caused by algae blooms.</p> <p>More than half of the original Everglades has been destroyed to make way for industry and urban development. Thousands of acres of wetlands have been drained, with more than 1,400 miles of canals snaking through the area in order to divert water.</p> <p>Some environmentalists have welcomed the plan as long overdue assistance for the Everglades. But others have criticized the planning project for not including any restoration of lost habitat.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be more clean water for the Everglades but not nearly enough as most of it will still be discharged into the ocean,\u201d said Matthew Schwartz, executive director of the South Florida Wildlands Association.</p> <p>\u201cWith those billions of dollars they should be buying key pieces of agricultural land in order to bring back natural wetlands. That is what true Everglades restoration would be. Rather than just pushing dirt around we need the wetlands back to clean the water.</p> <p>\u201cWe are turning one of the world\u2019s great wetlands into a development. People come here to look at herons and manatees, not reservoirs and housing. You can\u2019t do much once the land has become a Target shopping center, but agricultural land can be converted back.\u201d </p> <p>But Rubio said the sugar industry, as well as other smaller businesses, have been unfairly targeted by green activists.</p> <p>\u201cThey want to turn these communities into ghost towns, and they want to take these people out of business, all for something that isn\u2019t going to in the end solve the problem,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The House of Representatives is expected to take up its own version of the water bill, which similarly includes a $1.95bn authorization toward the Central Everglades, as early as next week. Bill Shuster, a Republican representative from Pennsylvania who chairs the relevant committee in the House, said he was optimistic Congress would send final legislation to Barack Obama\u2019s desk by the end of the year.</p> <p>Backers of the planning project acknowledged the work was only just beginning. But they praised this week\u2019s step as the first major increment toward long-term restoration.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that the Central Everglades Planning Project may be to date the single biggest step we have taken toward Everglades restoration,\u201d said Shannon Estenoz, director of Everglades Restoration for the US Department of Interior.</p> <p>At a time when Congress has become near synonymous with gridlock, Estenoz praised the rare show of bipartisanship that enabled Everglades supporters to cross this hurdle. </p> <p>\u201cThe Florida delegation have been staunch supporters of the Everglades and so they get a lot of credit, particularly the south Florida delegation and both of our senators,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the heart of restoring the River of Grass.\u201d</p>",

On the one hand, I could picture black families coming here and reveling, rightfully, in our contribution to the United States. The museum will help black adults and children feel celebrated in a society that disregards us, and such respite is necessary. It was truly joyous being with adult black journalists from around the country as giddy as kids going to Disneyland. </p> <p>And yet, the museum supports a fiction. What good to African Americans, I have to wonder, is a museum dedicated to us, when we are getting shot in the street daily? When we\u2019re routinely being slaughtered by police? When we die on average<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/28/not-white-thing-suicide-african-americans\"> years younger than our white counterparts</a>? When we have <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/02/why-some-americans-are-more-equal-than-others.html\">1/12th the wealth </a>of white people, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/02/05/465748249/african-americans-face-uncertain-reality-despite-low-unemployment-rate\">twice as much unemployment</a>? </p> <p>I worry that the museum is playing into a central trap of respectability politics: that if we just present ourselves in right way \u2013 on the National Mall! with a modernist building! \u2013 black lives will be seen as worthy. This would be a tenuous fiction at the best of times, but especially while a black man has had the most high-profile seat at the table of respectability politics of them all: the American presidency, which has done little for altering disparities in black health or wealth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85a8b4e084dfb58a25ad9ed9f43f75855297d7cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a8b4e084dfb58a25ad9ed9f43f75855297d7cc/0_108_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The taking the stage section of the exhibition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The taking the stage section of the exhibition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This museum might have meant more, say, during the Reagan 80s of my youth, <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=40708\">when Martin Luther King Day</a> was inaugurated. Then, the fiction that a veneer of respectability could help black people would held more weight; my father, who hated Reagan, would have loved this museum and seen it as a chess move to get white people to take black people seriously. But when Obama formally opens the museum next week, he will do so as the first black president who is also leaving office with black people still suffering disproportionately. Black people have been protesting in the streets, football players have been kneeling and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/08/beyonce-black-panthers-homage-black-lives-matter-super-bowl-50\">even Beyonc\u00e9 has been wearing Panthers garb</a>, because we have seen that symbols of progress mean little in protecting us.</p> <p>That jig is up. If the Oval Office can\u2019t help our cause, can a museum? </p> <p>Or is this too big a goal to lay at the feet of the NMAAHC? <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.si.edu/About/People\">David Skorton</a>, the Smithsonian\u2019s secretary, said \u201cpeople appear to change, especially young people\u201d when they\u2019re in a museum. But the older I get, the less interested I am in racism as representation, or in terms of how people appear to change; I increasingly understand racism in terms of power relations. </p> <p>I was happy to see a great racial mix of creative people working at the museum as architects and curators. But as I walked around, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that as they scurried to get the museum ready for opening day, all the construction workers I saw were men, and most (not all) were white. At the same time, every single security worker I saw (male and female) was black, just like at most places. And in the cafeteria, every person serving food was black and brown, while the chefs and managers overseeing them were all white \u2013 something that felt especially uncomfortable as the food stations, like the slavery exhibits, were divided into southern and northern regions. When white tourists go to the cafeteria, they will be as likely to be served food by a black face as they would have a half-century ago. </p> <p>Is it asking too much to want a museum about African Americans to undo racial job patterns and upend power relations? Perhaps. But a museum like this is also bolstering a national American identity, so it has high ambitions which deserve to be scrutinized. It opens its doors when the Black Lives Matter movement has made football players, protesters and commentators like myself question everything about celebrating US nationalism. And so I am left with as many questions about the NMAAHC as I have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/barack-obama-speeches-correspondents-dinner-flint-howard\">about the Obama presidency</a> or the American experiment.</p>",

Serums, as defined by the beauty industry, are concentrated skincare products designed to target a specific skin issue, be that ageing, acne or dullness. You apply them after cleansing and before moisturizing and the idea is that their tiny little molecules penetrate deep into your skin to deliver a strong hit of \u201cactive ingredients\u201d. Ingredients depend on the problem being targeted but common components include Vitamin C (to increase collagen), hyaluronic acid (for moisture) and niacinamide (improves skin elasticity).</p> <p>Serums tend to be pricier than other skin care options. <a href=\"http://www.drsebagh.com/\">Dr Sebagh</a>\u2019s signature serum costs $830 for 30ml \u2013 which works out to about $138 a teaspoon. Sephora has options from $5 to $590. As well as being potent and pricey, serums tend to be full of sketchy science. Indeed, detractors might say they are the purest distillation of beauty industry BS: a cocktail of vague claims in pretty packaging. </p> <p>For every detractor, however, there\u2019s a consumer who will swear to you that a serum changed their skin and transformed their life, it really did! Earlier this week the Benchmarking Company, a US beauty consumer research firm, polled 2,400 female beauty consumers and found that 85% of them used a facial serum. Of these women 70% said that they feel their facial serum is somewhat effective at addressing her facial skincare concerns, and 22% say their serum is extremely effective. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An increasing number of dermatologists have their own skincare line or another vested interest in shifting product</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many dermatologists would back up these effectiveness claims. Dan Dhunna, for example, one of the UK\u2019s leading cosmetic doctors, touts serums as being a \u201ccritical part of 21st-century skincare\u201d. But it\u2019s hard to know just how objective medical professionals really are; an increasing number of dermatologists have their own skincare line or some other sort of vested interest in shifting product. </p> <p>Back in 1998, before serums really took off, Dr Ernst Epstein wrote a letter to the <a href=\"http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=188966\">Journal of the American Medical Association Dermatology</a> titled Are We Consultants or Peddlers? Epstein wrote: \u201cThere is a price paid by the dermatologist who sell cosmetics \u2026 It is our integrity \u2026 Our patients are deluged with ads proclaiming the special qualities of \u2026 magic rejuvenators of aging skin. Scientifically, this is all nonsense; we know that while some of the \u2018cosmeceuticals\u2019 may temporarily plump up the skin a bit more than others, the differences are trivial and temporary.\u201d</p> <p>Timothy Caulfield, a health law and policy professor, said there is a broader \u201cbeauty industry efficacy bias\u201d. Caulfield cites the rollout of the new Glossier line as a great example of it, \u201cEveryone\u2019s lined up on the side of wanting it to work.\u201d First there are the clinicians: it\u2019s in their interest that it works. \u201cAnd then you have the patients and the public who desperately want it to work. And then you have that whole beauty media infrastructure and bloggers who have an interest in having an exciting story to tell and maybe have advertisers who are selling the products. All of those interests are aligned to telling a story of effectiveness.\u201d</p> <p> Indeed, if you look at the coverage of Glossier\u2019s serums, it\u2019s glowing.</p> <ul> <li>Glossier\u2019s New Serums Are Basically Magic Potions to Transform Your Skin wrote <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.glamour.com/lipstick\">Glamour</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> <li>I Test-Drove Glossier\u2019s New Super Serums and This Is Why I\u2019m Freaking Out [Prayer hand emoji] said <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a22600/glossier-super-serums/\">Marie Claire</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/183939-how-to-use-glossiers-the-supers-serums-for-a-balanced-skincare-routine-photos\">Bustle said</a>: \u201cTheir [sic.] pretty much super heroes for the skin.

Hope is good! You know what\u2019s a real downer, particularly for advertisers? Articles that say: \u201ca new product has launched in an already super-saturated market. It is probably 99% nonsense but, hey, the bottles will look great in your bathroom, make you hate your life a little less for a few minutes and rack up some likes on Insta.\u201d</p> <p> While serums may make claims of clinically proven effectiveness the bottom line is that none of these studies really stand up to scrutiny. As Caulfield explains, the \u201cstudies are often small, they use a very particular kind of compound, and the endpoints are often quite subjective\u201d. But perhaps this doesn\u2019t really matter. </p> <p>Perhaps the idea that we can keep our inevitable march to the grave at bay with some nice cream is worth the money. As Caulfield observed \u201cmany women and, increasingly, men, use these products even though they know they don\u2019t work. There\u2019s almost a ritualistic aspect, that it makes you feel better about yourself, that you\u2019re doing what you can\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Our bay tree is one of the best buys we\u2019ve ever made. Bays grow happily in a pot or in the ground and, once they take to their new home, have to be regularly pruned to keep them under control, which has obvious benefits for the cook of the house. Even so, bay has a very underrated scent. Sure, it\u2019s the solid stalwart of the stock pot, but beyond that it tends to get overlooked. Not in our house, though, because bay is delicious in all kinds of dishes, from poached pears (or plums or damsons, as in today\u2019s second recipe) to simple creams and savoury rubs. I also regularly blitz a handful of bay leaves with other herbs and salt, and smear the result over a joint of meat or fish, or tuck it into the cavities.</p> <p>Our plum tree is another source of regular pleasure and every year around this time, we are awash with its fruit. Being at the front of the house, our tree also provides passers-by with free treats.</p> <h2><strong>Balsamic-baked new potatoes with taleggio cheese and bay</strong></h2> <p>This is a brilliantly satisfying dinner in its own right, but if you need something more, serve alongside roast pork or a Barnsley chop. Serves four as a main course, more as a side.</p> <p><strong>1 large white onion, peeled and halved </strong><br><strong>1kg new potatoes</strong><br><strong>Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br><strong>4 tbsp balsamic vinegar</strong><br><strong>5 bay leaves (fresh, ideally)</strong><br><strong>150g taleggio, sliced</strong><br><strong>100g rocket leaves</strong><br><strong>A few sprigs fresh thyme, picked</strong><br><strong>20g finely shaved parmesan</strong><br><strong>1 lemon, juiced</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Cut the onion into thick pieces across the halves; leave the potatoes whole or, if they are on the large side, cut them into bite-sized pieces. Toss the potatoes and onion in half a teaspoon of flaky sea salt (less if using fine sea salt), lay them in an oven tray and roast for 30-40 minutes, until golden and tender.</p> <p>Tip the cooked veg into an oven dish and pour the vinegar over the top. Toss to coat, then tuck in the bay leaves and cover with the slices of taleggio. Season with a touch more salt and lots of pepper, and bake for 10 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and golden.</p> <p>Meanwhile, put the rocket, thyme leaves and parmesan in a bowl, dress with the lemon juice and oil, season generously and toss gently. Serve with the hot, cheesy potatoes.</p> <h2><strong>Damson (or plum) trifle</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82200da577e6334ee0b5062737294440486c70a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82200da577e6334ee0b5062737294440486c70a6/0_51_1881_1128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 damson (or plum) trifle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 damson (or plum) trifle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Grease and line a 33cm x 23cm roll tin with baking paper.</p> <p>First, make the sponge. In a large bowl, whisk the sugar and eggs until light and frothy, then sift in the flour and gently fold in to combine. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 10-12 minutes, until lightly golden, bouncy and a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool.</p> <p>Halve and stone the damsons or plums, then put in a wide pan with the sugar, spices, lemon rind and a splash of water. Cook on a high heat for a minute or two, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the fruit is very tender.</p> <p>While the fruit is cooking, make the custard. Heat the cream, vodka (if using) and vanilla pod until just below boiling point. Remove the vanilla pod, split it lengthways and scrape the seeds into the cream mix; leave to cool and infuse. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and sugar until thick and pale, then whisk in the cream mix. Tip back into the pan, and stir for 10-15 minutes over a medium heat, until the custard thickens and coats the back of a spoon.</p> <p>Now build the trifle. Put the sponge in the base of a transparent, two-litre bowl, pressing it firmly into the base. Spoon over the vodka and some of the cooking juices from the fruit, then spoon the damsons over the sponge, making sure they go right to the edges of the bowl (make sure there are no errant stones). Top the fruit with the custard.</p> <p>Whip the cream to soft peaks and spoon in large dollops on top of the custard. Sprinkle with the crushed pecans, toasted almonds, biscotti and a little extra plum syrup (if you want to gild the lily, grate over 20g of very dark chocolate, too).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/26/borlotti-bean-salad-wild-black-bream-recipes-thomasina-miers\">The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 borlotti bean salad and wild black bream recipes</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>And for the rest of the week\u2026</strong></h2> <p>The taleggio bake can very easily be turned into a richer, meatier dish. Dice the cheese into 1cm cubes, then mix with a chopped onion, a crushed clove of garlic and some lardons, then sprinkle over the potatoes before baking. If, like me, you\u2019re looking to use up excess plums or damsons, turn them into a ripple ice-cream. Just double the quantities in the trifle custard, then stir-freeze or churn in an ice-cream machine; pur\u00e9e the fruit and, as the custard thickens, pour it in bit by bit and stir so it ripples through the ice. Bay leaves make a delicious ice-cream, too: infuse them in the cream with the vanilla pod, or poach with the plums (add a vanilla pod or essence for a more classic flavouring). If you have a glut of plums, turn them into jam; vanilla and star anise is just one excellent pairing.</p>",

It\u2019s such an arresting image, taken by New York photographer Joni Sternbach, and is in contention for the 2016 Taylor Wessing prize. Sternbach uses processes used in 19th century early photography to give images a strangely disorientating look. Two other photographers are shortlisted: Kovi Konowiecki for his series on Orthodox Jews around the world; and Claudio Rasano for a student in his school uniform.

Counter-terrorism detectives are hunting for the 24-year-old, but believe he may have crossed the border into Syria to join Isis.</p> <p>Syeedy and Kadir, from Rochdale and Oldham respectively, developed a hatred of Uddin last summer after discovering he practised a form of Islamic healing called taweez<em>, </em>the court was told.</p> <p>Uddin moved to Rochdale 15 years ago from Bangladesh. The former imam was well known in the area for his use of healing amulets to ward off ill health and protect people from evil spirits.</p> <p>Uddin\u2019s friends warned that the killing had left an open wound in Rochdale\u2019s Muslim community, as his family paid tribute to a \u201cgreatly respected man, a caring and loving soul\u201d.</p> <p>Uddin\u2019s relatives said they had been \u201cleft empty\u201d by his murder in a statement released by police.</p> <p>\u201cWe came to court to seek answers from Mohammed Hassan Syeedy. He has shown no remorse or sympathy towards Jalal or his family, as indicative of his attitude and demeanour throughout the last four weeks,\u201d the family said.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough Jalal was a Muslim who peacefully practised his faith, he had a love and respect for all religions, cultures and creeds, and the fact that he was murdered by someone inspired by Isil shows the true nature and barbarity of this organisation and those who serve it.\u201d</p> <p>In a victim impact statement read to court, one of Uddin\u2019s seven children, Sala al-Arif, said his father told him two days before he died that he planned later this year to return to Bangladesh for the first time in 15 years to see his wife, children and grandchildren.</p> <p>Instead, he said, his relatives have been left with an \u201ceverlasting void\u201d. Al-Arif said that when he visited his father\u2019s body in the mortuary he was \u201cdenied the most basic human right\u201d to kiss his father\u2019s face because of the horrific injuries he had suffered.</p> <p>Describing his father as a \u201cdevout pacifist who showed nothing but love to anyone he came across,\u201d Al-Arif said Uddin\u2019s relatives had been left without answers as to why he was targeted: \u201cI cannot begin to understand why anyone would want to murder him. This is the ultimate question for me and my family: why was my father murdered?\u201d<br></p> <p>Jurors were told that Syeedy and Kadir, who were not known to the police, believed Uddin\u2019s use of<em> </em>taweez was black magic and that he deserved to be killed.</p> <p>Uddin, known as the Qari Saab by his followers for his deep understanding of the Qur\u2019an, was mocked as a magician by Syeedy and his friends, who nicknamed him Voldemort after the evil wizard in the Harry Potter books.<br></p> <p>Six months before the murder, Syeedy and his friends destroyed Uddin\u2019s notes and books on taweez after stealing them from their mosque. They then started monitoring Uddin\u2019s whereabouts, taking covert pictures of him in the street, as they plotted to have the community leader deported by immigration services.</p> <p>But that plan was abandoned after a photograph emerged of Uddin with the Rochdale MP, Simon Danczuk, outside the Jalalia mosque in December last year. One of Syeedy\u2019s friends shared the photograph and commented: \u201cOh crap ... voldermort nvr gna b busted by immigration now.\u201d</p> <p>When detectives arrested Syeedy five days after the murder, they found gruesome footage on his phone of Uddin dying, along with reams of Isis propaganda.<br></p> <p>Jurors were shown photographs of Syeedy holding an Isis-style flag outside the Jalalia mosque. In another image, he wore a stabproof vest outside the mosque.</p> <p>Other photographs showed Syeedy and two people holding a jihadi flag over a road sign in Rochdale that had been altered to read: \u201cWar zone.\u201d </p> <p>Detectives also found a black, Isis-style baseball cap, arm patches and a flag in Syeedy\u2019s home, where he lived with his mother, younger sister and younger brother.</p> <p>Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, told the court that Syeedy had been drawn in by Isis propaganda surrounding the Syrian war over a period of three years.</p> <p>In 2013, he travelled to Syria on a medical aid convoy at around the same time that Alan Henning, the murdered Salford taxi driver, went on a similar \u201cRochdale to Syria\u201d trip, the trial heard.</p> <p>Syeedy told the court he was friendly with Henning and was \u201cdisgusted\u201d when he heard that the 47-year-old had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/04/alan-henning-failed-by-british-government-brother-in-law\">beheaded by an Isis militant</a> who was revealed last year to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/the-tall-quiet-kid-who-became-a-monster\">Londoner Mohammed Emwazi</a>.</p> <p>Det Ch Supt Tony Mole, head of the north-west counterterrorism unit, said: \u201cThis has been a long and delicate investigation, with detectives working meticulously to establish exactly what happened to Jalal and I want to thank them for their work.</p> <p>\u201cI would also like to thank the local community for the patience and support they have shown us. Their assistance and understanding has been vital and they have been a credit to Rochdale.</p> <p>\u201cI hope the outcome here today will bring some closure to Jalal\u2019s family and help them continue to rebuild their lives following their tragic loss.\u201d</p> <p>One of Uddin\u2019s friends, Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation charity, urged the Rochdale community to come together or \u201cwe may see such tragedies again\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is beyond doubt that these young minds are being brainwashed and groomed online, they have no engagement or involvement with any of the mosques and these institutions are failing young Muslims.</p> <p>Giving evidence, Syeedy denied knowing anything about Uddin\u2019s murder, but admitted he was with Kadir before and after the attack.</p> <p>He said he never suspected that his friend, whom he knew was an Isis sympathiser, had killed Uddin, even though the former imam was found dead moments after Kadir left the playground.</p> <p>Syeedy, an electrical engineering student who dropped out of university, denied being an Isis supporter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/alleged-killer-imam-court-islamic-state-rochdale\">described the group\u2019s actions</a> as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d. </p> <p>He told jurors he did not agree with Uddin\u2019s use of taweez<em> </em>because it was dangerous to meddle with the supernatural world, but that it was up to God to deliver the punishment. \u201cThis is my country, I abide by the laws,\u201d he told the jury.</p>",

Whoever succeeded Nigel Farage was likely to plunge Ukip into charisma deficit but, on the basis of that speech, Diane James seems remarkably bland. To her credit, though, she acknowledged quite openly that she was not a colourful character. \u201cI am not Nigel-like, I am not even Nigel-lite,\u201d she said. You certainly can\u2019t argue with that.</p> <p>Still, dull and sensible is not always a bad thing in politics and, although James did not say anything particularly specific in her speech, she did give some indication as to what sort of leader she will be. She stressed the importance of Ukip having a credible manifesto and she said the party should be offering \u201cpragmatic\u201d solutions to the country\u2019s problems. That means the era of bonkers ideas like<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/04/15/ukip-2015-manifesto_n_7068920.html\"> compulsory uniforms for taxi drivers </a>is definitely over. By Ukip standards it was a remarkably moderate speech. The only line that slightly jarred was her claim that Ukip was the \u201copposition party in waiting\u201d (a touch of David Steel telling the Liberals to go back to their constituencies and \u201cprepare for government\u201d?) But she compensated for that with a reasonably good line about the Conservatives and \u201cmagpie May\u201d stealing Ukip policies.</p> <p>But that only raised the question that Alexander Phillips (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live?page=with:block-57dbb0f0e4b067ad3008849c#block-57dbb0f0e4b067ad3008849c\"> 9.51am)</a> and others have been asking: if Theresa May is adopting Ukip policies, then what is the role for Ukip? Like Farage earlier, James said Ukip would be insisting that Brexit does actually materialise, but she sounded far less suspicious on this front than Farage did and her demands (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live?page=with:block-57dbebcce4b0e813b694da80#block-57dbebcce4b0e813b694da80\">1.57pm) </a>sounded much the same as Liam Fox and David Davis\u2019s. In fact, about the only thing she said that would have sounded out of place in a speech at the Conservative party conference was her attack on first-past-the-post.</p> <p>And that\u2019s why Labour will be pleased by the speech. Ukip lead by a working-class leader with a northern accent committed to blue collar issues would have been a huge threat to Jeremy Corbyn. A party led by someone who sounds like a Tory is much less of a worry.</p> <p>But in one respect, at least, James\u2019s election should make Labour feel uncomfortable. The Tories are on their second female leader, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the DUP all have female leaders, the Greens have one too, but the only parties yet to get in on the act are the UK\u2019s two biggest \u201cprogressive\u201d ones, Labour and the Lib Dems.

(See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live?page=with:block-57dac330e4b0e813b694d5b0#block-57dac330e4b0e813b694d5b0\"> 9.18am.) </a>It is very rare to see a politician stand down having succeeded so completely in his own terms and, if this speech was triumphalist, then that was understandable. But in fact it was more reflective than smug, and Farage was very interesting as he reminisced on how Ukip had emerged from nothing, and how PR (for the European elections) was absolutely crucial to the party\u2019s success. Whether electoral reformers will regard that as good or bad for their case is another matter.</p> <p>Otherwise, by Farage\u2019s standards, it was relatively low key. Apart from taking a swipe at Neil Hamilton, he avoided the temptation to engage in internal party score-settling. (Perhaps he got that out of his system<a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/farage-on-carswell-i-dont-know-why-he-joined-10579532\"> with Sky.) </a>Instead he gave us some clues as to what he will be doing next: supporting leave movements in other EU countries, and building up a profile in the US. He repeated his claim that Ukip has a huge opportunity to take votes from Labour. And, interestingly, he set three tests for Brexit. Two of those may well be achieved by 2020: British passports (preferably old-style blue, hard-cover, inconveniently-sized ones, he implied) and withdrawal from the single market. But the chances of Britain having exclusive access to fishing waters up to 200 miles off the coast are slight because EU countries almost certainly would not accept this, and the threat of retaliatory measures would make it not worth the risk (<a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7669\">see this House of Commons briefing paper)</a>.

The party is at once libertarian and authoritarian. It preaches individual freedom but contains admirers of Vladimir Putin. It wants to privatise the National Health Service, apart from when it does not. It has flirted with both a tax on luxury goods and deep tax cuts for the richest. It hems and haws on gay marriage, halal food and the burkini. It is vague about what sort of immigrants Britain should let in, and in what numbers. Even on the EU it is utterly divided: some (like Mr Carswell) want Britain outside the union to become a European Singapore, while others (like Aaron Banks, the forthright businessman who bankrolled the party\u2019s pro-Brexit efforts) want something more like a return to the 1950s.</p> <p>All parties, and especially populist ones, contain a range of views. Yet they tend to congregate around certain stretches of the political spectrum. Founded in pursuit of Brexit alone, UKIP has no such common ground. On sprawling, defining themes like the vocation of the state, the meaning of nationhood, the interaction of public and private spheres, and the roles of pluralism, globalisation and citizenship in modern societies it has no continuity and is irredeemably at odds with itself. That inhibits it from establishing and sticking to the sort of long-term strategy it needs to become and remain more professional.</p> <p>This points to a grim cycle. The last time Mr Farage resigned, UKIP tumbled. For 11 ignominious months Lord Pearson, a languidly aristocratic former Tory, trashed his party\u2019s prospects: in a television interview shortly before the 2010 election he appeared not even to have read its 14-page manifesto. All of which may now repeat itself. \u201cOne quite plausible possibility is we end up with a re-run of the Lord Pearson experience: a year or two of messy and incoherent leadership under a figure not cut out for the big leagues, then Farage comes back,\u201d suggests Robert Ford, a UKIP expert at Manchester University. The fact is that UKIP\u2019s weaknesses point to Mr Farage\u2019s weird genius. Besides the quest for Brexit, his unique schtick was all the party had. Now, again, it may be its only salvation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57daccf8e4b067ad3008811c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T09:00:54.697Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nigel Farage on Ukip's NEC</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier I quoted what<strong> Nigel Farage</strong> had to say about Ukip\u2019s national executive committee.

It is called the National Executive Committee. Many of its current crop are among the lowest grade of people I have ever met. To them, being a member of the governing body of Britain\u2019s third-largest political party is the equivalent of scaling Everest.</p> <p>People with no qualification in business or politics make the ultimate decisions of whom should be our candidate at a by-election. Or whether the former disgraced Tory MP Neil Hamilton should be given a route back to public life via being elected as an Assembly Member in Wales. It may sound odd to many but I have been a moderniser in Ukip. I have been fought at every step of the way by total amateurs who come to London once a month with sandwiches in their rucksacks, to attend NEC meetings that normally last seven hours.</p> <p>The new Leader of Ukip should bypass the vanity of such people and make big decisions about Ukip\u2019s future via direct polling of the membership. Yes of course, it brings risk but in a way we get back to the Brexit referendum result. Do you trust the political class or the people? Ukip must trust its members.

Its supporters would claim that it is the most successful party in the history of British politics. Its detractors would claim that it is one of the most shambolic and useless. Both descriptions are reasonably accurate.</p> <p>Ukip has only won one national election (the European elections in 2014) and it only has one MP, but if you judge a party by whether it has achieved its key objective, then Ukip\u2019s record is hard to fault. Just over 20 years after it was founded, it got exactly what it wanted: a referendum on EU membership, and a vote to leave. No other party can make this boast. There is an argument to be had about quite how important a part Ukip played in the EU referendum campaign itself. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/douglas-carswell-im-having-far-too-much-fun-lo-leave-ukip\">(Douglas Carswell, Ukip\u2019s only MP, told the Guardian at the weekend that leave only won because Vote Leave ignored the approach favoured by Ukip\u2019s leader Nigel Farage.)</a> But Ukip was decisive in ensuring that the referendum was held in the first place. David Cameron has a hearty dislike for Farage and Ukip, and he conceded a referendum because he was under pressure to do so from Tory MPs, but those Tories had leverage because the Ukip started soaring after the 2010 general election and Cameron concluded that, without offering a referendum, the Conservative party could not win in 2015 (and/or he could not survive as leader).<br></p> <p>But, organisationally, Ukip is also a total disaster. In fact, it is so riven with hate and feuding that it makes Labour relatively harmonious.

  "<p>When I tell people that I am in charge of documentary films at the Guardian, it can cause some confusion: it is normally only broadcasters who have documentary departments. </p> <p>This week the Guardian is reaffirming its commitment to documentary with the launch of our new documentary strand. We\u2019ll be releasing monthly films on our website, each lasting about 20 minutes. Online, even five minutes is considered a challenging length for viewers, but we believe there is an audience for these longer, more considered films. </p> <p>News organisations with their roots in print can often approach documentaries as if they are extended news articles. We\u2019re trying to do more than that with these documentaries, which tell complex stories from around the world. They\u2019re not intended to replace text articles or news videos, we just recognise that these stories are best suited to film, where a short scene can tell you as much as thousands of words. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/sep/16/gun-nation-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-americas-gun-culture-video\">Gun nation: a journey to the heart of America's gun culture \u2013 video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first of these documentaries is called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/sep/16/gun-nation-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-americas-gun-culture-video\">Gun Nation</a>. It\u2019s a film about guns in America, and we wanted to get beyond the typical polemic focused on only victims and anti-gun campaigners. Instead, director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zed-nelson\">Zed Nelson</a> captured unguarded interviews with the Americans who use guns every day, as well as one affected by disaster. It starts from a place of an outsider\u2019s bewilderment and asks gun-lovers \u201cDon\u2019t you want a solution too?\u201d</p> <p>As with other Guardian documentaries, Gun Nation is made by an independent film-maker and production company. I receive pitches from all over the world; it\u2019s part of my job to spend time travelling, meeting independent voices. It\u2019s important we don\u2019t just commission the loudest voices, so that sometimes means working with emerging talent and helping them develop their ideas. </p> <p>The Guardian is part of a small movement of print organisations including the New York Times, the New Yorker, the Economist and Der Spiegel that are serious about making documentary and other video content. I admire what these other organisations are doing, but I want the Guardian to offer stories that feel different and really tell you something new.</p> <p>How do we do that? I hope by commissioning film-makers who have spent long periods in communities that are difficult for us to reach and are dedicated to following theese stories from start to end. Working <a href=\"http://www.documentary.org/feature/how-bertha-foundation-has-transformed-global-nonfiction-media-landscape-0\">with Bertha Foundation</a>, a social justice organisation, we want to give a platform to voices that don\u2019t get heard enough and for stories outside the news cycle, which means minimising voiceover and letting characters speak for themselves.</p> <p>Getting a film to screen is a long process. Gun Nation was in planning for a year, shooting lasted for six weeks, and the edit took more than three months. All that to make a documentary of just under 30 minutes. Zed and our editor, Noah, started the edit with hours and hours of footage. As well as the 12 characters featured in the film, we had talked to another 10 from across the country, including survivors of gun violence. </p> <p>Sifting and logging this material so we can work out the structure of the film takes weeks \u2013 it is in the process of trimming, refining and rearranging that the documentary really gets made. The background to Gun Nation was <a href=\"http://www.zednelson.com/?GunNationTheBook\">Zed\u2019s photo project</a> of the same name made at the turn of the millennium and, in our documentary, Zed pays a return visit to the subjects of his portraits. We hoped to balance this with a wider story of America in crisis. </p> <p>I come from a background in the documentary industry, and I am all too aware of how few documentaries reach a broad audience. Some make it to Netflix, Amazon or iTunes, some are screened on the BBC\u2019s Storyville, some find other ways to reach viewers. Unless you go to film festivals or you live in a big city, trust the algorithms or already know what you\u2019re looking for, you can miss many of the great ones.</p> <p>This is frustrating for film-makers, who spend years developing, shooting and editing these films. They want to reach as big an audience as possible but, among the massive diversity of films online, documentaries have to fight for attention and can struggle. We\u2019re trying to do something about that.</p> <p>I probably get pitched more than a thousand documentaries a year. Nearly all of them sound as if they would tell important or entertaining stories, but I can make only a fraction of them. We\u2019ve got documentaries coming from Peru, Hong Kong, Sudan, Italy, Australia and more besides. Some are worrying, some are uplifting, some you won\u2019t know how to feel about, but they\u2019re all united by being stories that could be neglected if we didn\u2019t cover them in depth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04d8d15485a30bea8327009a846a059813ce8698\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04d8d15485a30bea8327009a846a059813ce8698/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside gun shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gun Nation features unguarded interviews with Americans who use guns every day</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zed Nelson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It feels important that the Guardian commits itself to these stories, because documentaries can pull attention to big issues and stories in a way other formats can\u2019t. </p> <p>A one-off documentary such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jul/26/blackfish-video-review\">Blackfish</a>, or a series like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/07/making-a-murderer-the-netflix-documentary-beating-tv-drama-at-its-own-game\">Netflix\u2019s Making a Murderer</a> shows that documentaries can prompt change and provoke debate on a huge scale. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/14/act-of-killing-review\">The Act of Killing</a>, for instance, brought the Indonesian genocide of the 1960s to an international audience who would otherwise remained ignorant, and did it while breaking the boundaries of what a documentary could look like. </p> <p>I love documentary in its ever-evolving shapes, and I think I\u2019m not the only one. Online audiences, particularly younger ones, are watching documentaries that stimulate political thought and action. And the ethos of the documentary industry has a lot in common with the principles of the Guardian \u2013 a commitment to truth, a commitment to rigorous research, a commitment to independence. <br></p> <p>I hope you enjoy our new documentaries as they are lunched on the website in the next year. And I hope also that you will suggest the stories, people and places we should look to for our next commissions.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this week, Jeremy Corbyn pledged to set up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/jeremy-corbyn-plans-academies-to-train-labour-activists\">Labour organising academies</a> aimed at teaching supporters new skills that will help transform their communities. The initiative is partly a result of the radical changes Labour has undergone since Corbyn\u2019s election a year ago, but it is also an attempt to rebut the widely held view that he is unelectable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/jeremy-corbyn-plans-academies-to-train-labour-activists\">Jeremy Corbyn plans academies to train Labour activists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Agree or disagree with that, one inarguable fact is that the party has swollen its ranks hugely. So how can these new members be utilised? Trained properly, these members can have an impact well beyond the party\u2019s electoral chances, empowering communities and changing lives. But this will work only if the activist academy follows the correct principles to build effective campaigns.</p> <h2>1. Be inclusive </h2> <p>Whether we\u2019re talking policy training at Corbyn\u2019s academies or a local event about community policing, diversity is at the heart of all healthy civil society movements. In order to be relevant you have to make space for everyone. From experience, the most sustainable and effective movements are also those built on trust and friendship: a tedious meeting won\u2019t tempt me away from the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off\">GBBO</a> episode on a cold and windy night. But a lively discussion, followed by a pint with close friends, might. That human element cannot be underestimated.</p> <h2>2. Keep your eyes on the prize</h2> <p>The biggest failings in civil society organisations stem from an inability to answer the most basic questions and articulate a clear end-goal. That requires some strategic analysis, which should also form part of any training. What does success look like? How does that success manifest itself? What actions are required to get there, by whom and when? Participation in discussions that shape a theory of change, and a good understanding of priorities, should be central to any activist academy.</p> <h2>3. Not everyone needs to do everything </h2> <p>One of the challenges that Corbyn has faced is to engage the groundswell of support in the most effective way. Phone banks may be busting at the seams, but there are other new members who could bring different skills. Activist academies should help supporters identify what their strengths and weaknesses are, what they want to do and where they can be most effective. It should include a skills audit and a streaming process that places activists in appropriate schools. Some people will be excellent candidates for disseminating learning across the wider movement; others will be experienced community activists who can lead on door-knocking; others will be better placed to project manage, organise events, fundraise or analyse data. Helping activists to thrive is key to sustained success.</p> <h2>4. Be open to new ideas </h2> <p>The world is changing, and activists need to keep up. There are of course many seasoned veterans from whom we can, and must, learn, but if you always do what you always did, you\u2019ll always get what you always got. And that stagnation is the antithesis of social change. You have to constantly and honestly assess and evaluate whether what you\u2019re doing is still the most effective way of reaching your end goal. Any campaign should incorporate opportunities for frank but kind conversations about successes and failures, and lessons that can be learnt. That also means helping activists build bridges across generations, and finding a way to balance micro and macro issues, especially in a broad church such as the Labour party.</p> <h2>5. Be authentic </h2> <p>This is genuinely important, but frankly I would have included it simply as an excuse for to remind everyone of David Cameron\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/apr/25/brain-fade-aston-villa-fan-david-cameron-confuses-his-team-for-west-ham-video\">Aston Villa gaffe</a>. It\u2019s OK not to know everything about everything. And if you don\u2019t know the basics, leave well alone.</p> <h2>6. Communications </h2> <p>Whether you\u2019re speaking to the media or knocking on doors, the basics are the same. For Corbyn\u2019s Labour party, communication has been \u2026 challenging. Sometimes this has been for reasons beyond their control \u2013 in-built bias in the rightwing media for example. But the basics must be adhered to. Communication is as much about listening as speaking. Once you\u2019ve listened, feedback and act. Let people know \u201cwe\u2019ve heard you say x, and are now doing y\u201d. It takes time to build rapport on doorsteps, so don\u2019t rush. Be open and polite, succinct and relatable. Don\u2019t overcomplicate things: all people will remember are three key points, and even those will be best recalled if you can illustrate them with stories and concrete, relevant examples. And on doorsteps, cut your losses if you\u2019re clearly on a losing streak.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s social media. No doubt Corbyn\u2019s team will go to great pains to educate supporters about sensitivities around social media, particularly when it comes to allegations of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/22/corbyn-eagle-abuse-labour-mps-cameron-honours-politics-live\">bullying</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/18/labour-antisemitism-jews-jeremy-corbyn\">antisemitism</a>. Regardless of their accuracy, these have been damaging and counter-productive. Those who genuinely support any cause should be cautious and disciplined in their communications. If in doubt, leave it out.</p> <h2>7. Deal with people\u2019s actual issues </h2> <p>Finally, it\u2019s so important that national campaigns and long-standing organisations tap into issues that affect people\u2019s lives. A good campaign is driven by those issues, rather than a desire to sell a particular party. For Labour, this is an opportunity to actually improve people\u2019s lives \u2013 ultimately, to look good you have to do good. The core aim of the activist academies should be to serve communities and improve people\u2019s lives, through empowering members and supporters. With a bit of luck, the indirect consequence will be an increase in votes. Because helping people learn how they can influence the world around them is core to any genuinely democratic system. If done right, this initiative is one that should be universally celebrated, regardless of our voting habits.</p>",
  "<p>We were a <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/congress-of-racial-equality\" title=\"\">Congress of Racial Equality</a> student group (we called ourselves Core) \u2013 Bernie Sanders was our president \u2013 and we&nbsp;were occupying the offices of George Beadle, the university\u2019s president. I\u2019m sitting on the floor, on his left, in a pale sweater with a black bob. We were protesting against the segregation of some of the university\u2019s private housing in Chicago. We stayed for several days, sleeping on the floor, until it changed its policy. Which it did.</p> <p>These were early days in the civil rights movement, and this was one of the first college sit-ins. We were amazingly well-behaved. I was studying history, and read Aristotle to while away the hours. During the day, I baked and sold brownies at the student union for the Turn Toward Peace organisation, which was raising money to send buses to Washington for a rally. When I found time for my schoolwork, who knows.</p> <p>I grew up in New York, a \u201cred diaper baby\u201d, so-called because my parents were lefties. I picked Chicago because it had a politically active student body and was intellectual, too. Bernie was a year above me. We moved in different circles; my friends and I were politically to his left. If you\u2019d told me he would run for president one day, I\u2019d have said, \u201cOh yeah, right!\u201d He was a swell guy, a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn, but he wasn\u2019t terribly charismatic. One of his strengths, though, was his ability to work with a wide group of people, even those he didn\u2019t agree with.</p> <p>There was controversy earlier this year as to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/11/stop-sending-around-this-photo-of-bernie-sanders/?utm_term=.6579db245fd9\" title=\"\">whether this is Bernie Sanders addressing the floor or another student leader, Bruce Rappaport</a>. This photo featured in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyee_sxJpXc\" title=\"\">Bernie\u2019s campaign video for his Democratic nomination</a>, even though a year earlier four Chicago alumni had <a href=\"http://time.com/4108379/bernie-sanders-photo-civil-rights/\" title=\"\">come forward to say it wasn\u2019t him</a>. The photographer, Danny Lyon \u2013 himself a big name in the civil rights&nbsp;movement \u2013 later confirmed it was Bernie, even if his campaign team says they\u2019re \u201cnot 100% sure\u201d. But Rappaport\u2019s former wife is sure it\u2019s Rappaport. I think it suits Bernie\u2019s detractors to try to undercut his civil rights credentials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/26/spencer-tunick-naked-art-newcastle-photograph\">\u2018I kept my eyes firmly above the chin\u2019: Peter Stanford poses nude for artist Spencer Tunick, 17 July 2005</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I first saw this image on Facebook earlier this year, and thought, \u201cThat sure looks like me.\u201d I sent it to several friends and they all said, \u201cOf course it\u2019s you \u2013 you haven\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d</p> <p>After this, I stayed active in the peace movement.

  "<p>Barack Obama\u2019s announcement that the United States proposes to admit 110,000 refugees over the course of the next year has elicited a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/14/outgoing-obama-plans-to-increase-refugees-by-twenty-nine-percent-next-year/\">furious</a> reaction from some Republican leaders. This was predictable. A spirit of xenophobia has once again taken hold in the United States, as has happened on several previous occasions in American history.</p> <p>As early as 1798, just a few years after the establishment of the Republic, Congress adopted a Naturalization law that was intended to keep out radicals who could promote sedition. The main targets were the French, who might spread the \u201cJacobin\u201d ideology of the French Revolution. In the 19th century, a focus of exclusion was the Chinese who were explicitly kept out under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. That law was not repealed until 1943, when it became embarrassing because China was an ally of the United States in the war against Japan. In the early part of the 20th century, a number of measures were adopted to limit the admission of southern Europeans, such as the Italians, ostensibly because they were thought to be more likely to spread the anarchist ideology than fairer-skinned immigrants from northern Europe. And so things have gone.</p> <p>Today, of course, the main focus of those denouncing Obama\u2019s proposal is Syrian refugees. Up to now, the United States has admitted a few more than 10,000. So far, at least, their resettlement in the United States has seemed to go very well, though Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, has tried to keep them out of his state.</p> <p>Additional refugees from Syria would constitute a minority of those that Obama proposes to admit over the next year. The number projected for all countries in the Middle East and South Asia is 40,000. Yet in this election year, in which the Republican nominee for president swept aside his opponents for the nomination by saying he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and he would bar all Muslims from entering the United States, has made xenophobia look like a winning political strategy.</p> <p>As should be apparent, a wealthy country of 320 million people can easily absorb 110,000 refugees. In the year that ends 30 September, America\u2019s goal has been 85,000 refugees. The increase is modest given the scale of the global refugee crisis. It compares poorly to neighboring Canada, with a population just over ten percent of the United States. </p> <p>In the brief period between 15 November 2015 and 29 February 2016, Canada admitted 25,000 Syrian refugees, as well as many refugees from other countries. As Canada\u2019s highly popular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not have political opponents trying to win office by exploiting xenophobia, the absorption of the Syrian refugees has been accepted not only approvingly but enthusiastically by the great majority of Canadians. A large number of the refugees have been sponsored by Canadian church groups, parent-teacher associations and other non-governmental organizations that have paid the initial costs of resettlement, and helped the refugees to find homes, learn English, get jobs and get their children into schools. </p> <p>Canada carefully screens refugees accepted for resettlement. So does the United States. Typically, the American screening program for refugees lasts more than a year. That is possible when an orderly program is established. It is one of the reasons that a refugee program such as that conducted by Canada, and the one under which the United States admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees in the past year, tends to succeed. </p> <p>I don\u2019t think Americans are inherently more xenophobic than their Canadian neighbors. In such matters, as in much else, political opportunism plays a big role. It seems to bring out the worst in many people, including those denouncing the president\u2019s modest proposal.</p>",

This is because the company has provisions set aside for litigation costs at \u20ac5.5bn. However, the ADI values will be a focus now for the bank.

But you don\u2019t actually do these things, do you? Instead, you check Facebook. You read football blogs. You distractedly shovel peanuts into the vicinity of your mouth while watching videos of excruciating public marriage proposals or skateboard accidents on YouTube.</p> <p>All of which highlights a frustrating irony about rest and recuperation. Why should you take a proper, wholesome break? Because you\u2019re tired. And why do you fail to do so? Because you\u2019re tired. Making yourself take restorative action requires what\u2019s known as self-regulation \u2013 and self-regulation, plenty of research suggests, is at its lowest when you\u2019re exhausted.

Not surprisingly, the study concluded that bedtime procrastination is associated with sleep deprivation, which means you\u2019re even less likely to have the energy to haul yourself to bed the following night.</p> <p>Is there any way out of the trap? Intriguingly, Jarrett points to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26375961\">research suggesting it\u2019s best to start taking breaks early in the day</a>, before you feel you need to: these apparently pay more dividends in terms of replenishment. Also, focus first on getting outside, not only because nature and fresh air are good for you, but because there\u2019ll be fewer screens there to distract you. (You don\u2019t need self-regulation when the temptation is absent.) Finally, don\u2019t be shocked if it doesn\u2019t feel good at first: when you\u2019re all keyed up on cognitive tasks, stopping can be more painful than continuing. Yes, you need a break. But don\u2019t expect to want one.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>British soldiers who forced a 15-year-old Iraqi boy into a canal and watched him drown after the 2003 invasion of the country have been condemned by a judge heading an inquiry into the incident.</p> <p>Ahmed Jabbar Kareem Ali was one of a number of Iraqi civilians who were forced into canals and rivers as British troops struggled to contain widespread looting that was triggered by the collapse of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime.</p> <p>Sir George Newman, who is conducting a <a href=\"http://www.iraq-judicial-investigations.org/index.aspx\">series of inquest-style hearings</a> into Iraqi civilian deaths, said in a <a href=\"http://www.iraq-judicial-investigations.org/linkedfiles/reports/iraqfatalitiesinvestigationsreportintothedeathofahmedjabbarkareemali(web-optimisedpdf).pdf\">report</a> into the death of Ali published on Friday that he was now likely to investigate why the practice spread, and examine the response of the military high command.</p> <p>Sir John Chilcot\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/the-report/\">report</a> into the Iraq war disclosed that Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, who was then chief of the defence staff, issued no instructions on how to deal with an outbreak of lawlessness, despite the joint intelligence committee and the Defence Intelligence Staff warning that it was likely, and despite Tony Blair and the Ministry of Defence recognising the seriousness of the risk.</p> <p>Ali and three other youths were detained while looting in Basra, forced into the back of a Warrior armoured fighting vehicle and driven five miles to the Shatt al-Basra canal, where they were forced into the water.</p> <p>Newman said that all four youths \u201cmust have been terrified\u201d and that Ali was \u201caggressively manhandled and assaulted\u201d by the soldiers.</p> <p>\u201cHis death ensued because he was forced by the soldiers to enter the canal, where, in the presence of the soldiers, he was seen to be in difficulty, and to go under the water,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The judge was scathing about the soldiers\u2019 \u201cmanifest failure\u201d to take any action to save the drowning boy\u2019s life. \u201cNotwithstanding the unlawful treatment involved in getting him into the water, his death could have been avoided because he could and should have been rescued after it became clear that he was floundering.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a clumsy, ill-directed and bullying piece of conduct, engaged in without consideration of the risk of harm to which it could give rise.\u201d</p> <p>Four soldiers serving with the Irish and Coldstream Guards were subsequently charged with manslaughter but cleared at courts martial in 2006.</p> <p>During his inquiry, Newman heard evidence from one of the soldiers, anonymised as SO18, that he could see Ali panicking as he began to slip under the water, but he then obeyed a command to get back into the Warrior. Another, giving evidence as SO16, said he had been getting undressed to get into the water to rescue Ali, when he heard the order. \u201cWe got back into the vehicle and that was that.\u201d</p> <p>An MoD spokesman said: \u201cThis was a grave incident for which we are extremely sorry. We are committed to investigating allegations of wrongdoing by UK forces and will use Sir George\u2019s findings to learn lessons to help ensure nothing like this happens again.\u201d</p> <p>After the invasion, British troops had moved quickly from fighting for control of Basra and the surrounding region to attempting to deal with looters.

It is perhaps less obvious from another car, yet still if a vehicle is weaving unpredictably as it makes its way down a motorway the explanation, more often than not, turns out to be the driver using a phone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/20/drivers-mobile-phones-150-pounds-fines\">Crackdown on drivers using mobile phones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using a handheld phone while driving is, without any stretch of the imagination, dangerous. However there are such grave difficulties in securing a conviction for dangerous or even careless driving, especially in the absence of a collision, that the small proportion of offenders caught and prosecuted will be given a fixed penalty notice conferring three penalty points and a fine of \u00a3100.</p> <p>Late last year David Cameron\u2019s government consulted on increasing the fixed penalties for mobile phone use to \u00a3150 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/20/drivers-mobile-phones-150-pounds-fines\" title=\"\">three to four penalty points</a>, and the Department for Transport is still considering the responses to the consultation. The proposed points increase implies that you may only get away with being caught doing it three rather than four times within three years before reaching 12 points and thereby rendering yourself eligible for a driving ban.</p> <p>Criminologists, though, tell us that an increased likelihood of being punished is more effective a deterrent than a remote chance of a slightly larger penalty. Furthermore, most offending motorists know that they are running a small risk of very serious trouble. They demonstrate this knowledge by the regularity with which they attempt to delete their texts after they have run some innocent victim down. Fortunately, they are usually thwarted because a continuing record remains on analysis of the phone and of the service provider\u2019s records.</p> <p>This is an offence that needs to be taken a great deal more seriously. With sickening regularity reports emerge of lives being cut short or changed for ever as another road user, often a vulnerable one such as a cyclist or pedestrian, is run down by a driver who is using a phone. In the absence of a crash, a motorist will in practice only be sanctioned if seen by a police officer. This is of itself, given the diminished number of police officers patrolling our roads, an unlikely eventuality. Even then all is not lost.</p> <p>I once accompanied a member of the Metropolitan Police Cycle Task Force for a morning and watched in bemusement as he let off the driver of a heavy tipper truck chatting on his handheld phone as he drove down Fulham Road with \u201cwords of advice\u201d.

Mr Martin was riding a time trial, so Gard should have been aware of a stream of cyclists spaced approximately a minute apart for a stationary spectator (or about 20 seconds relative to Gard). However he had been texting and drove into Lee Martin. Gard, it transpired, was a habitual mobile phone user behind the wheel. He had been caught eight times, for which he received five penalty notices or summonses to court. The last court appearance before the fatal collision was only six weeks earlier. He was on that occasion clearly concerned about possible disqualification. He contested the charge but was convicted following trial. He then successfully pleaded that \u201cexceptional hardship\u201d would result if he was disqualified and the court permitted him to keep his licence.</p> <p>There is a thriving industry of lawyers who unashamedly advertise their services as the best prospect of keeping a licence after multiple offending.

  "<p>I have never been shy of a&#xa0;challenge. I practise as a priest, but in my spare time I have climbed Mount Everest, sailed around the world and trekked to the North Pole.</p> <p>I first knew I wanted to fly around the world in a hot-air balloon in the early 90s, when the race between Bertrand Piccard, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/10/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-interview\">Richard Branson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fossett\">Steve Fossett</a> began. Finally, in 2002, Steve Fossett <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/02/4\">managed to fly solo</a> after six attempts. I wanted to be the first to do it on the first attempt.</p> <p>For the last two years I trained extensively, spending 150 hours in balloons. This summer, aged 64, I&#xa0;was in Northam, Western Australia, waiting for a weather window. I chose to fly east: across Australia, over the Pacific, South America, the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.</p> <p>With my ground team, I spent 24 hours preparing the balloon, fuel and capsule. It took us 10 hours to spread it out across the airfield, connect all the parts and fill it with 10,000 cubic metres of helium.</p> <p>Thousands of people had gathered to witness the launch on 12 July and, at 7.33am, I took off. It was perfectly executed, with a smooth and steady ascent. I was wildly excited but had some doubts \u2013 I was venturing into the unknown. I couldn\u2019t guarantee I\u2019d see my friends and family again.</p> <p>My living area inside the gondola was a capsule, a carbon fibre box 2m x 1.8m. It was designed to float if I&#xa0;landed in water, but having sailed around the world four times I&#xa0;knew I&#xa0;wouldn\u2019t be able to survive the harshness of the Southern Ocean in it. I&#xa0;didn\u2019t stop watching the weather, communicating with my land team and changing altitude to optimise the speed and direction. As I passed New Zealand and entered the space above the Pacific, I felt an incredible sense of relief, because there is less air traffic over the sea.</p> <p>Above 5,000 metres you need an oxygen mask to survive. On my fifth day, I was flying over the Pacific at 8,500 metres when I noticed the safety valve on my oxygen cylinder was faulty and I was losing oxygen. It was terrifying. I managed to save myself from suffocating by climbing on to the roof of the gondola and adjusting the pressure in the cylinder to stop the oxygen escaping.</p> <p>I was on standby 24 hours a day, freezing cold, sleep deprived and lonely, but I never questioned why I&#xa0;was doing this. It is such a unique experience to see our beautiful planet from the gondola: it gave me a sense of how small it is. Being on constant watch eliminated the sense of time. It was an 11-day state of wakefulness, with half-hour naps here and there. Even when sleeping, part of my brain was still listening and sensing the situation. I had to constantly stay alert to control the flight, altitude, my&#xa0;oxygen flow, and to look out for cumulonimbus clouds, because they are a sign of atmospheric instability. I&#xa0;had to hold a spoon between two fingers to keep myself awake: if I&#xa0;dozed off, it would fall and clang against the floor, waking me up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/26/experience-bitten-by-rabid-bat\">Experience: I was bitten by a rabid bat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Temperatures reached -50C. Over the Atlantic, the gondola was covered in a thin layer of frost. Flying at 9,000m at 200km an hour, I&#xa0;climbed out to chip the ice off the burners for an hour until they restarted.</p> <p>Nine days in, I was caught in a&#xa0;thunderstorm over the Indian Ocean for three hours. To avoid the lightning, I had to fly at 10,500m, a&#xa0;very dangerous height. I thought I&#xa0;was going to die. It was both physically and emotionally draining. Luckily, I&#xa0;managed to spot a narrow gap between the belt of huge clouds and find a calmer course.</p> <p>Seeing the coast of Australia again on my 11th day was a huge relief. I&#xa0;knew my journey was nearly over. It was to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/russian-priest-in-hot-air-balloon-flies-round-the-world-in-record-time\">a new world record</a>. I could see my team celebrating below as I&#xa0;flew over. After a bumpy landing, my hatch was opened and I saw the faces of my friends and family. It hit me when I was finally able to stand on the ground and hug my sons Oscar and Nikolay. Flying for 11 days solo, thousands of metres above the ground, and then all of a sudden seeing familiar faces was a relief beyond words. This challenge really pushed me to my limits, but it hasn\u2019t put me off.

So why didn\u2019t his marriage of smell and picture messaging excite more interest? </p> <p>From a technical point of view, smell is simply harder to mass communicate than sounds and pictures. \u201cThere are two main technological obstacles to making smell transmissible by digital means,\u201d explains biophysicist and author of Perfumes: The A-Z guide, Dr Luca Turin. </p> <p>\u201cFirst, there are no odor \u2018primaries\u2019 like RGB or CMYK. That means you cannot obtain the full gamut of doors from mixing a few. Second, it has, for mysterious reasons, proved impossible to stimulate the olfactory epithelium directly by any means tried so far. This means that it is currently impossible to elicit a sensation of smell without there being an actual chemical in the inhaled air.\u201d</p> <p>But as well as these significant scientific barriers, scent occupies an uneasy position in our modern culture.</p> <h2>The hankering for \u2018artisanall\u2019 scent</h2> <p>Scent is big business in 2016. <a href=\"http://www.perfumerflavorist.com/fragrance/trends/Forward-Thinking-Fragrance-Frenzy-382254811.html\">An estimated</a> 2,400 new fragrances will launch this year, and amongt these are a growing number that position themselves as artisanal scents \u2013 emphasising the connection with physical materials rather than abstract nouns.

Why?</p> <p>\u201cIf you have craft beer, and clothes being made by hand in a small boutique, you\u2019ll also have perfumes that have that artisanal feel to them,\u201d explains Dr Morgaine Gaye, a food futurologist and one of the curators of this year\u2019s FutureFest in London. \u201cHowever the irony is \u2026 these perfumes are artificially made. They\u2019re molecules constructed by chemistry as opposed to real molecules from nature.

In terms of digital culture, however, the desire for something with the whiff of craftsmanship is arguably a counterpoint to a life increasingly lived online. </p> <p>While projects like the oPhone long to bring olfactory experiences into digital communication, perfumes that emphasise their (albeit illusory) connection to natural scents move in the opposite direction, scratching an itch technology can\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cThe more we\u2019re plugged into the virtual world, the more we deeply appreciate the contrast \u2013 moments in our human experience,\u201d says designer and olfactory artist Mindy Yang. \u201cIntuitively, we realize that we are starved of certain sensations. With the rise of digital culture, society has, perhaps subliminally, become more interested in the missing sense \u2013 what we smell.\u201d</p> <p>This interest in scent isn\u2019t only happening within the worlds of perfume and fashion. Over the past few years a number of cultural projects have set out to focus on the power of sensory experiences, from the use of a <a href=\"http://www.hrp.org.uk/exhibition-archive/the-glorious-georges/the-glorious-georges/the-glorious-georges-at-hampton-court-palace/#gs.TeQJStI\">smell map</a> at Hampton Court Palace for \u201can olfactory tour of the smells of a royal palace\u201d, to the Tate Sensorium, which in 2015 let users experience visual art alongside smells, tastes and sounds. Artists such as<a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/artist/victoria-adam\"> Victoria Adams</a>,<a href=\"http://www.bgprojects.com/projects-1/\"> Brian Goeltzenleuchter</a> and<a href=\"http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2011/03/07/smelling-the-books/\"> Rachel Morrison</a>, to name a few, all position scent as a core part of their practice, pulling on ideas of personal memory, tactility and the power of scent to evoke feelings of desire.</p> <h2>We are defenceless to smell</h2> <p>There is commercial interest in leveraging this power. Yang is exploiting this to creates scents specifically designed for individual brands. \u201cSimilar to lighting and sound design, I compose invisible frequencies that sets the tone in the physical space,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere is no guard against a fragrance as an emotional trigger so long as one is not anosmic [unable to discern smell]! Done right, olfactive marketing is an incredibly powerful tool.\u201d</p> <p>The olfactory system in our brain has a close relationship with the limbic system, which is strongly involved in a person\u2019s emotional life. This gives scent the power to affect our emotions in a way that is much more direct than visual and auditory stimuli. While we may have developed certain barriers to the predictable tropes and rhythms of poster and radio adverts, the effect of smell is much harder to block. You can understand why companies want to tap into it.</p> <p>\u201cYou can not look, and you can not listen, but you can\u2019t <em>not</em> breathe,\u201d says Gaye. \u201cSo you can\u2019t <em>not</em> smell. So you don\u2019t have a choice. The brands that are doing it more cleverly are the ones where you don\u2019t know it is happening. You never question it. Nescaf\u00e9, with the glass jars with plastic lids and foil, have been embedding the smell of Nescaf\u00e9 in the labels for decades, so you smell it off the shelf. You smell it as a brand, but you don\u2019t know you\u2019re smelling it.\u201d</p> <p>Gaye also tells me about a tactic used by the London toyshop Hamleys, which pumps out the smell of pi\u00f1a colada \u201cbecause it makes the parents linger longer\u201d. Techniques like these are hard to control, however, with sensory effects being so unpredictable \u2013 depending on everything from specific cultural associations to the day\u2019s weather. But that isn\u2019t stopping brands trying to stoke involuntary emotional responses to their products, though.</p> <p>Department stores and coffee jars aren\u2019t the first to connect scent to involuntary feeling. The seductive control of the senses has been dabbed on the wrists of churches, brothels and hospitals throughout history \u2013 to ease us, to soothe us, to excite us. \u201cOdors have a power of persuasion stronger than that of words, appearances, emotions, or will,\u201d writes the German author Patrick S\u00fcskind in his 1985 novel, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer. \u201cThe persuasive power of an odor cannot be fended off, it enters into us like breath into our lungs, it fills us up, imbues us totally. There is no remedy for it.\u201d </p> <p>Whether it\u2019s devices likes the oPhone trying to introduce scent into digital messaging, or olfactory brand strategists that want to leverage our limbic systems, organisations are growingly aware of our culture\u2019s desire for sensory experiences. In a time of virtual reality and scentless social networks, it\u2019s perhaps no wonder that we as a culture have such a desire for something that instinctively feels real and authentic \u2013 even if it was made in a lab. </p>",

The opening bounce is scheduled for 7.50pm EST.</p> <p>As is always the case in semi-final week the narrative is overwhelmingly optimistic about the two elimination final winners, while doom and gloom follows the qualifying final losers. That means the praises of the Western Bulldogs have been sung from the rafters, and talk of Hawthorn\u2019s dynasty crumbling to dust have grown louder.</p> <p>If we allow reason to intervene briefly, Hawks fans needn\u2019t be so concerned. They\u2019re unbeaten in their last eight against the Dogs, and only five teams have gone out in straight sets since the current finals system was introduced in 2000. </p> <p>The Bulldogs are easy for the neutral to get behind though, from the obstacles they\u2019ve overcome this season, through their long wait for a flag, to their blue collar inner-west credentials. They\u2019re more than just a plucky stooge too. In Marcus Bontempelli they boast the recently announced captain of the AFL\u2019s under-22 representative side, and around him there are some the finest young inside midfielders in the competition. The question remains, can they impose themselves on the scoreboard sufficiently to threaten a club as well practiced in such scenarios as the experienced Hawks? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af93c8a174b3a5033d734cefcfbfb1895837e8f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af93c8a174b3a5033d734cefcfbfb1895837e8f1/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This will never stop being amusing; a \u2018No dogs allowed on the oval\u2019 sign at the Whitten Oval.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This will never stop being amusing; a \u2018No dogs allowed on the oval\u2019 sign at the Whitten Oval.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Postles/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57db7b59e4b0e813b694d864\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T04:56:29.567Z\">5.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jonathan will be with you shortly but in the meantime, check out his preview of this weekend\u2019s round of AFL semi-finals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/16/inside-50-bulldogs-look-to-defy-the-odds-as-sydney-face-a-crow-attack\">Inside 50: Bulldogs look to defy the odds as Sydney face a Crow attack | JP Howcroft</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>Flash flooding, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/16/torrential-rain-travel-chaos-england-floods\">struck a swathe of southern and eastern England</a> on Friday, is a greater threat to homes, roads and railways than river or coastal flooding. Yet it was completely excluded from the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/08/flooding-uk-government-plans-for-more-extreme-rainfall\">National Flood Resilience Review, published last week</a>.</p> <p>Worse, the risk of flash flooding is rising, as climate change leads to more intense, more frequent rainstorms: the Met Office has shown that <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2013/2012-weather-statistics\">extremely wet days have become more common</a>. On Friday, half a month\u2019s rain was dumped in one day.</p> <p>The problem is the overloading of Britain\u2019s antiquated drainage and sewer networks, compounded by the continued concreting over of land for development. The surface water can neither be absorbed or quickly drained away, leading to flash floods.</p> <p>Ministers cannot say they were not warned. Flash flooding was the principal cause of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_United_Kingdom_floods\">most damaging floods in UK history</a>, which in 2007 caused over \u00a33bn of damage, caused 13 deaths and was classified by the Environment Agency (EA) as a \u201cnational disaster\u201d.</p> <p>In 2013, <a href=\"http://watermaps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiyby.aspx?topic=ufmfsw#x=357683&amp;y=355134&amp;scale=2\">new maps</a> from the EA showed 3m properties were at risk from flash flooding in England, compared to 2m from river and coastal flooding. Most insurance claims made each year for flood damage are because of flash floods and there are at least 20,000 sewer overflows a year in the UK.</p> <p>Risks to transport have also been identified: <a href=\"http://www.networkrail.co.uk/publications/weather-and-climate-change-resilience/\">Network Rail is monitoring 200 \u201chigh risk\u201d earthworks</a> \u2013 embankments and cuttings vulnerable to washing away. In April the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/10/57-tube-stations-high-risk-flooding-london-underground-report?CMP=share_btn_tw\">57 tube stations are at high risk of flash flooding</a>, including Manor House which flooded on Friday. The London Underground report said it was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before serious flooding strikes.</p> <p>After the 2007 disaster, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/25/flooding.weather2\">Pitt review</a> led to new laws in 2010 to implement the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_drainage_system\">sustainable drainage systems</a>, which provide safe areas for water to pond. But the provisions were never implemented and instead a voluntary system asking developers to follow these practices was put in place.</p> <p>But it has not worked: the government\u2019s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), found that just 15% of planning applications in areas of flood risk incorporate sustainable drainage measures and in 2015 the CCC <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-further-measures-needed-to-promote-sustainable-drainage-in-new-development/\">warned ministers their plans were inadequate</a>. However, in May, the government successfully <a href=\"http://www.hortweek.com/suds-loses-housing-planning-bill-passed-law/landscape/article/1394920\">opposed a plan to make sustainable drainage compulsory</a>, and to make developers increase the capacity of drains to which new homes are connected.</p> <p>\u201cThe National Flood Resilience Review team was told it was a mistake to exclude surface water flooding from consideration on the basis that the last two major flood events had been river flooding,\u201d said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics.</p> <p>\u201cWe know our major cities, including London, are vulnerable to surface water problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the UK remains at risk because the government refuses to confront the problem. The main problem is the inadequacy of the drainage system, which even nine years after the 2007 floods are still not up to the task.\u201d</p> <p>The EA maps shows that one home in particular is at risk of flash flooding: No 10 Downing Street. Perhaps this might spur prime minister Theresa May to finally take meaningful action.</p>",
  "<p>I am late with my contribution to the revitalised grammar school debate, but I\u2019ll continue as I have a relatively unusual perspective for a broadsheet columnist \u2013 in the 70s I went to a working-class grammar. Some of the children there were middle class, but most were from my background \u2013 a few violent skinheads, quite a lot of indifferent yobs, and a small number of bright, ambitious kids. I suppose I was one of them, although I tried to hide my intelligence. \u201cYou swallow a dictionary, or something?\u201d was the customary aggressive challenge to my&#xa0;loquacity.</p> <p>Grammar school did help me into social mobility, but not in the way you might expect. I got two poor A-levels, and did not attend university until 10 years after I left school. But I did get something out of my grammar school, a diluted version of what children who go to private school also get \u2013 a sense that I was capable, even special.</p> <p>I developed the feeling that I was part of a group of which there were certain hopes and expectations. This has been a powerful force in my life. I may have come from a household where no books lined the shelves, where we read the Daily Express and listened to Radio 2, but my school helped me believe I could move beyond these parameters. This had nothing to do with academic ability and everything to do with confidence.</p> <p>Things have changed. Social mobility rates have stagnated or dropped. Grammar schools are unfashionable and I fully understand why \u2013 the implication that you are a failure at the age of 11 is a bitter pill to swallow.</p> <p>However, what isn\u2019t usually mentioned is the other side of the coin \u2013 the positive effect of being told you are (potentially) some kind of success. Something, on the whole, a working-class child, however talented, at even a good comprehensive can find hard to believe despite the mass of egalitarian propaganda to the contrary.</p> <p>If grammar schools are merely colonised by the middle classes looking for a cheap alternative to the even more unfair option of private schools, then there is no point in bringing them back. Also, if they are determined by a crude, culture-laden 11-plus style \u201cintelligence\u201d test, then they are also useless.</p> <p>But given that a large number of working-class children simply don\u2019t have a chance anyway, some kind of leg up might be worthwhile. If grammar schools were established in primarily poor and disadvantaged areas and based on potential rather than ability, they might be the least worst option. My 14-year-old daughter was admitted to her (state) school on a music scholarship not on the grounds of any tutoring \u2013 she had hardly held an instrument \u2013 but because she had perfect pitch.</p> <p>I am not, at heart, an egalitarian, because I believe that while class and environment plays a big part in development, people have different abilities and aptitudes inborn. These aptitudes, however, are unfairly masked by money and power. Grammar schools established largely in working-class areas might make a difference. Yes \u2013 it means that some children might end up feeling bad about themselves at a tender age. Then again, as I know only too well, working-class life is full of shit of one kind or another and selection is just another kind of shit they might have no choice but to put up with. If they are anything like the kids I grew up with, they will be tough and resilient if nothing else.</p> <p>At least then a substantial few will have a real chance of escape \u2013 rather then simply being universally offered the empty rhetoric of future success, which is all they get now. If the price you pay is a certain amount of bad feeling \u2013 possibly temporary \u2013 among a lot of other working-class kids, perhaps it\u2019s a price worth paying.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/timlottwriter\" title=\"\"><em>@timlottwriter</em></a></p>",
  "<p>I\u2019ve been a regular reader for more than 50 years. I was born in Smethwick, a Black Country town that is dominated by council houses. It\u2019s an industrial town, a Labour heartland, and was known nationally for metal goods and the prominent Labour politician <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Gordon_Walker\" title=\"\">PC Gordon Walker</a>. Smethwick saw an influx of west African and Asian immigrants. Many people know it for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/britains-most-racist-election-smethwick-50-years-on\" title=\"\">the notorious 1964 Tory slogan</a>: \u201cIf you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.\u201d</p> <p>At Holly Lodge grammar school, I read the Times, the only quality paper pushed by sixth-form masters. I&#xa0;remember vividly the difficulty I had in reading it. There were so many words outside my vocabulary. After that I read more widely, finding the Manchester Guardian and becoming hooked on Letter from America by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/31/pressandpublishing.broadcasting\" title=\"\">Alistair Cooke</a>. I owe more to the Guardian than most of my degree courses. Although a poor geography undergraduate, I can now appreciate that in the 1950s the subject made little or no reference to the politics that influenced economic and social issues.</p> <p>From my position as a former secondary school teacher, college of education lecturer and independent inspector, I can now appreciate the value of reading the Guardian and the Observer on a regular basis. My&#xa0;favourite writers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee\" title=\"\">Polly Toynbee</a> (by some distance my number one), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/willhutton\" title=\"\">Will&#xa0;Hutton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamkeegan\" title=\"\">William Keegan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewrawnsley\" title=\"\">Andrew Rawnsley</a>.</p> <p>Coming from a working-class background, Smethwickian heritage and&#xa0;a commitment to social justice, I&#xa0;feel strongly that everyone should read a quality newspaper to form a viewpoint based on reasoned argument and evidence.</p> <p>The Brexit disaster illustrated the contempt of many for \u201cexpert\u201d and professional arguments on both sides, self-interest being dominant in many cases. For me, the most interesting and informed comments come from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\">readers\u2019 letters</a>, which so often add relevant information on major issues of the day, such as the NHS and education, thus providing current evidence that supports the thrust of most major articles and ensures greater objectivity.</p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 If you would like to be interviewed in this space, send a brief note to </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:good.to.meet.you@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>good.to.meet.you@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Nigel Farage has said he plans to stay in frontline politics after stepping down as Ukip leader, even though his former deputy urged him not to try to \u201cback-seat drive\u201d the party.</p> <p>Speaking just before the announcement of Ukip\u2019s new leader on Friday, Farage told the party\u2019s annual conference he would \u201cadvise\u201d his successor and continue to lead Ukip\u2019s rightwing alliance in the European parliament.</p> <p>\u201cI hope to be engaged in political life without leading a political party,\u201d Farage told a packed hall in Bournemouth, adding that he planned to travel to other EU nations this autumn to \u201ctry and help independence and democracy movements\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be freer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be less constrained. From now on I\u2019m really going to speak my mind.\u201d<br></p> <p>His speech came immediately after the outgoing deputy leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-nuttall\">Paul Nuttall</a>, urged his former boss to let the new leader govern alone and end the factionalism that has gripped the party. \u201cUkip has not been a happy camp for over a year,\u201d said Nuttall, who had been tipped to run for the leadership, but is instead stepping down from Ukip\u2019s front rank.</p> <p>Splits had \u201ccreated a cancer in the heart of the party and led to its leading lights using Ukip as a football\u201d, he said. \u201cAt the present moment the party resembles a jigsaw that has been emptied on to the floor. The new leader must put it back together.\u201d</p> <p>He explicitly told Farage to stay away. \u201cToday is a breakwater in the history of this party,\u201d Nuttall said. \u201cIt is a changing of the guard. Both Nigel and I are standing down from the stage. And standing down must mean standing down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eda5915c4dfc38f92d5d76d6774687b5ff61d59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eda5915c4dfc38f92d5d76d6774687b5ff61d59/0_160_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Nuttall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Nuttall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe new leader will not benefit in any shape or form if any of us attempt to back-seat drive. They must be their own person. They must stamp their own mark and they must take control of every lever of the party.\u201d</p> <p>However, the scale of the welcome for Farage showed the hold he still has over Ukip. Speaking to repeated cheers and ovations, Farage began by hailing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">the EU referendum</a> result, while warning that Theresa May\u2019s government might not fully implement Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cThere is going to be a great political battle ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cMy concern would be this: with Labour in the mess that it\u2019s in \u2026 and the Conservatives perhaps heading towards 2020 in a very comfortable and a very easy position, the temptation on the prime minister will be to go for a soft Brexit, as opposed to a hard Brexit.

I think, folks, I\u2019ve done my bit.\u201d But then he added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up politics completely. As I say, I\u2019m going to support the new leader.

  "<h2><strong>Day 1</strong></h2> <p><strong>Morning<br></strong>Start with a tour of the city\u2019s most historic district, the St. Lawrence neighbourhood. Local historian/man-about-town <a href=\"http://www.brucebelltours.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bruce Bell</a> will show you interesting views of the <a href=\"http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">St. Lawrence Market</a> (proclaimed best in the world by National Geographic) \u2013 and the historic town jail. The market is filled with everything from water buffalo sliders to smoked teriyaki salmon and fresh raspberries as deep and red as the Maple Leaf flag.</p> <p>Stop in the market for a class Canadian lunch: a peameal bacon sandwich at <a href=\"http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/vendors/vendor_detail/56\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carousel Bakery</a>. For about \u00a34 (C$7), you\u2019ll get thick, juicy slices of bacon that are really more like cured ham. Other options at the market include tasty veal or chicken sandwiches drenched in tomato sauce (and saut\u00e9ed onions, peppers and mushrooms) at <a href=\"http://www.unomustachio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uno Mustachio</a>. Want something more formal? The highly rated <a href=\"http://www.biagioristorante.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Biagio</a> is nearby.</p> <p><strong>Afternoon<br></strong>From the market, head east on the Queen streetcar to The Beaches neighbourhood. Toronto has a series of fine beaches along Lake Ontario, with boardwalks and bike trails that march for miles alongside shady parks. There\u2019s decent swimming in summer, as well as stand-up paddle boarding and beach volleyball played by athletic, youthful locals. If that\u2019s your thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5ae21d6d4d98b18ed50e399d98c46e2089f9801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5ae21d6d4d98b18ed50e399d98c46e2089f9801/0_190_5100_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Take a walk along the boardwalks looping around Lake Ontario and check out the beach volleyball action.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take a walk along the boardwalks looping around Lake Ontario and check out the beach volleyball action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Education Images/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Evening<br></strong>Stop in at the Distillery District for a local lager or ale at <a href=\"http://millstreetbrewery.com/toronto-brew-pub/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mill Street Brew Pub</a>. There are indoor and outdoor seating areas with great views of the restored industrial sheen of this historic district, once part of the Gooderham and Worts distilling empire. If you\u2019re not a drinker, settle in for a fabulous coffee at <a href=\"http://www.balzacs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balzac\u2019s</a> (open \u2019til 8pm) \u2013 grab a spot on the second-floor balcony for great views of the crowds below. Shops in the area include <a href=\"https://www.corktowndesigns.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Corktown Designs</a> (nice jewellery) and <a href=\"https://www.fluevog.com/stores/toronto-queen-st/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Fluevog</a> for shoes, and there are several cool galleries. For food, <a href=\"http://www.elcatrin.ca/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">El Catrin</a> restaurant has a terrific patio or the super-colourful mural indoors is an equally impressive backdrop. Try the guacamole, which they make at your table, or the pork tacos.</p> <h2><strong>Day 2</strong></h2> <p><strong>Morning<br></strong>Try breakfast at <a href=\"http://www.overeasyrestaurants.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Over Easy</a>, a nice cafe with just the right ambience on Yonge Street. If you want something lighter (and with fancier coffee), head instead to <a href=\"http://dineencoffee.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dineen</a>, just a few blocks north.</p> <p>To really appreciate Toronto, you need to visit one of the city parks when the weather is nice. People from all over the world congregate at open barbecues and play games or loll in the shade as the smoke from their lunch rises higher in the air. <a href=\"http://www.trinitybellwoods.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trinity Bellwoods Park</a> is a trendy spot in the West End, while Riverdale Park has a free farm kids will love. A trip to the <a href=\"http://www.torontoisland.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toronto Islands</a> also allows you the park experience <em>plus</em> a short ferry ride (but come early to avoid crowds). Alternatively, check out quiet waterways by canoe, or admire the refurbished homes on Ward\u2019s Island. There\u2019s a legal nude beach at Hanlan\u2019s Point too, near where former baseball legend Babe Ruth hit his first professional home run.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc0e3a0c07d3cf6803ddce3708beb2874f5f0921\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc0e3a0c07d3cf6803ddce3708beb2874f5f0921/0_418_4644_2786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stop for a fancy coffee at Dineen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stop for a fancy coffee at Dineen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Afternoon<br></strong>Some visitors hit the heights at the <a href=\"http://www.cntower.ca/intro.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CN Tower</a> (the highest observation area is 447 meters high) when they first get here. I think it\u2019s best to enjoy the view after you\u2019ve seen a bit and know what you\u2019re looking at. You can try the <a href=\"http://www.edgewalkcntower.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edge Walk</a> and suspend yourself from the roof via a cable if you like, or just enjoy the scenery from inside like a normal person.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.kensington-market.ca/Default.asp?id=home&amp;l=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kensington Market</a> is one of the city\u2019s other iconic sights. It\u2019s been an area dominated by Jewish, Portuguese and Chinese immigrants (and others) over the years. Nowadays it\u2019s a mixture of all of the above, along with hipster joints, Caribbean spots and Central/South American shops and restaurants. They close the streets to traffic on Sundays and the area becomes a parade of people from around the globe. Stop at <a href=\"https://eatrastapasta.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rasta Pasta</a> for great jerk chicken and rice (C$5 for a sizeable portion), or try <a href=\"http://www.amadeusdining.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amadeu</a>\u2019s for a taste of Portugal.</p> <p><strong>Evening<br></strong>A drink on the <a href=\"http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/canada/toronto/dining/deq\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ritz-Carlton</a> terrace is in order. It\u2019s in a quiet spot backing on to a small park, and they have some lovely Cuban-style drinks on the menu. Not far away is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/61494/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Wheat Sheaf</a>, billed as Toronto\u2019s oldest tavern. And up on Dundas Street West, <a href=\"http://rhumcorner.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rhum Corner</a> has exceptional rum drinks and a Caribbean-meets-the-big-city feel.</p> <p>Finish up with dinner on Ossington Avenue, the city\u2019s \u201chippest\u201d street. <a href=\"http://boraliato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boralia</a> makes meals based on recipes from Canada that date back as far as 1605, including mussels cooked over smoking pine needles (allegedly a recipe that explorer Samuel Champlain used in 1605).

  "<p>To boost Donald Trump\u2019s prospects of becoming president, the National Rifle Association is poised to pour more than $15m into ads in several battleground states to defeat Hillary Clinton, the most vocal pro-gun-control presidential candidate in years, according to an NRA board member.</p> <p>The NRA has already plowed almost $6.5m into TV spots in several key states bashing Clinton and one NRA board member told the Guardian that the pro-gun goliath will spend \u201cmultiples\u201d of that figure by election day on the presidential contest.</p> <p>Next week, the NRA is slated to launch another seven-figure round of TV ads in Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Last month, the NRA made a $3m ad buy in these states that branded Clinton as a \u201chypocrite\u201d for accepting secret service protection, while calling for more gun control, which the ad charged \u201cwould leave you defenseless\u201d. An earlier NRA ad buy attacked Clinton on Benghazi.</p> <p>In 2012, the NRA spent $15m in the hope of making Barack Obama a one-term president, and this year\u2019s spending to defeat Clinton is expected to surpass that sum, according to the board member and another NRA source. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/gun-control-activists-dc-rally-nra-congress\">Gun control activists at DC rally pledge to vote NRA supporters out of Congress</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The five million-member NRA\u2019s embrace of Trump, who once backed more gun control measures, has been spurred in part by its intense fear of a Clinton presidency. </p> <p> Democrats running for president have traditionally shown \u201ctrepidation\u201d about calling for more gun control, notes Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. But this year, Schlapp told the Guardian, \u201cthe NRA and gun enthusiasts are faced with the specter of a Democrat running for the White House embracing additional gun control\u201d.</p> <p>The NRA disdains Clinton\u2019s advocacy of moderate gun control measures \u2013including expanding background checks on gun purchases and reinstating a ban on assault weapons to curb mass shootings \u2013 but is fearful that she would nominate supreme court justices who do not concur with the NRA\u2019s staunch opposition to new gun controls.</p> <p>\u201cThis race is probably more about the supreme court than anything else from the NRA\u2019s perspective,\u201d said the NRA board member. </p> <p>The supreme court stakes are high: the vacancy created by the death of conservative Antonin Scalia is likely to remain open until the next president takes office. And the NRA is especially concerned that a more liberal court might overturn an earlier supreme court decision, known as Heller, which established an individual\u2019s right to keep a handgun in the house for self-defense.</p> <p>Significantly, the NRA\u2019s endorsement of Trump in May at its annual convention came earlier than usual: Mitt Romney and John McCain had to wait until October in 2012 and 2008 to get the NRA\u2019s blessing.</p> <p>The NRA\u2019s commitment to Trump was underscored when Chris Cox, the NRA\u2019s top lobbyist gave a primetime speech at the GOP convention this summer, a first for the increasingly GOP-oriented pro-gun lobbying behemoth. A senior GOP operative noted that historically the NRA \u201ctries to stay assiduously non-partisan. The dynamics of speaking at a convention are a little dicey.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/15/donald-trump-nra-guns-terrorism-watch-lists\">Trump to meet with NRA over barring guns for those on terrorism watch lists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NRA\u2019s big campaign blitz has been partly fueled by an aggressive fundraising operation which in recent years has targeted mega-donors. In 2014, for instance, the NRA received $4.9m from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the financial hub of the conservative advocacy network backed by the billionaire Koch brothers. The NRA is hoping to pull in another seven-figure grant this year, say two NRA sources, although nothing has come in yet and the Koch network itself is not focusing on the presidential race and Trump has been sharply criticized by Charles Koch.</p> <p>The NRA\u2019s entree to the Koch world stems in part from bonds that the gun group\u2019s top officials have forged. One donor who goes to the twice-a-year policy and fundraising retreats hosted by the Koch network, told the Guardian that the NRA\u2019s top executive, Wayne LaPierre, has attended them on a couple of occasions, affording him a chance to pitch and schmooze with big network donors such as investor Foster Friess.</p> <p>Another key big-money link involves the hedge fund tycoon Robert Mercer, who has given a pro-Trump Super Pac at least $2m, and is also a lifetime NRA member and a Koch network donor. This year Cambridge Analytica, a voter data firm in which Mercer is a key investor, has worked with the Herald Group, a DC-based consulting firm, to implement the NRA\u2019s \u201cTrigger the Vote\u201d drive to register new voters and get them to the polls. i360, a big voter data firm that is closely tied to the Koch donor network, has also been involved in the Trigger the Vote campaign. </p> <p>The pro-Trump blitz comes despite the real estate mogul\u2019s earlier backing for a ban on assault weapons and longer waiting periods for background checks with gun purchases, ideas that the NRA has rejected. But Trump\u2019s high-decibel anti-gun-control rhetoric this year seems to have ingratiated him with the NRA brass, and coupled with the strong pro-gun records of Trump\u2019s two sons, proved instrumental in winning the NRA\u2019s backing.</p> <p>Trump and the NRA parted ways briefly earlier this year, when Trump responded to the Orlando massacre by suggesting that if the nightclub where it took place had allowed its guests to bring in arms, then the killings could have been averted. The NRA quickly shot back to distance itself from Trump: speaking to an ABC news show, the group\u2019s top lobbyist, Cox, said that Trump\u2019s calls for arming people in clubs \u201cdefies common sense. It also defies the law.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cSo here we are. My name was Eileen Dunlop.

Her flight is made possible by a seductive redhead, an act of retribution, a serious crime and a gun: not surprisingly, the book has been tagged as \u201cnoir\u201d and a \u201cpsychological thriller\u201d.</p> <p>Add its hint of unreliable narration, and <em>Eileen</em> might appear to be jostling to enter Gillian Flynn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/20/gillian-flynn-gone-girl-review\"><em>Gone Girl</em></a> territory. Hollywood mogul <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/scott-rudin\">Scott Rudin</a> has bought the film rights, and the screenwriter hired for the project is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/erin-cressida-wilson\">Erin Cressida Wilson</a>, who has just adapted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/paula-hawkins\">Paula Hawkins\u2019s</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/08/the-girl-on-the-train-paula-hawkins-review-novel\"><em>The Girl on the Train</em></a>.</p> <p>Yet Moshfegh, 35, is not usually a writer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfredhitchcock\">Hitchcock</a>ian page-turners. For some years she has been touted as a \u201ccrucial\u201d new voice in American literature. Her prizewinning novella <em>McGlue</em> (2014) is literary and experimental, and her short stories have been published in such distinguished magazines as the Paris Review and the New Yorker. The coming together of a hip young \u201cwriter\u2019s writer\u201d with genre fiction has contributed to the buzz that has surrounded <em>Eileen</em> since its appearance in the US in 2015. More significant is that this intense, singular novel \u2013 both playful and fierce \u2013 is not exactly what it seems.</p> <p>I meet Moshfegh at her home in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, the day after she has learned of the Man Booker shortlisting. \u201cI\u2019d had a hard day,\u201d she says, \u201cand I\u2019d woken up at three in the morning in a state of panic, so went outside to smoke a cigarette \u2013 and I don\u2019t smoke very much. When I came back in, I found the email from my agent. And I just wrote back: \u2018Holy shit.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn't want to keep my head down and wait 30 years to be discovered \u2026 so I thought I\u2019m going to do something bold</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet Moshfegh (the second syllable rhymes with leg) wasn\u2019t wholly surprised. She is candid about <em>Eileen</em> being a deliberate exercise in playing with the format of commercial fiction to get the attention of a big publisher. <em>McGlue</em> and her early short stories might have won awards, but they didn\u2019t pay much, and she \u201cwanted to write a novel to start a career where I could live off publishing books. That was my prime motivation for writing <em>Eileen</em>. I thought, fine: I\u2019ll play this game. And I still feel like I\u2019m playing it.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t want to \u201ckeep her head down\u201d and \u201cwait 30 years to be discovered \u2026 so I thought I\u2019m going to do something bold. Because there are all these morons making millions of dollars, so why not me? I\u2019m smart and talented and motivated and disciplined and \u2026 talented: did I say that already?\u201d, she laughs. \u201cI said: fuck it. Which was also: fuck them. I was pretty hostile. I thought: I\u2019ll show you how easy this is.\u201d</p> <p>So Moshfegh \u201cwent out and bought a book called <em>The 90-Day Novel</em>, by Alan Watt. It\u2019s ridiculous, claiming that anybody can write a great book, and quickly too. And I thought if <em>I</em> were to do this, what would happen, would my head explode? So I followed it for 60 days \u2013 it was so <em>boring</em>. But it ended up as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/jul/12/oulipo-freeing-literature-tightening-rules\">Oulipian</a> thing, struggling with a limitation, and it was actually interesting to conform to the rules. So \u2026 it started out as a fuck-you joke, also I\u2019m broke, also I want to be famous. It was that kind of a gesture.\u201d Moshfegh pauses and frets \u2013 though she laughs again \u2013 that \u201cthe Booker people will be disgusted\u201d with her revealing the origins of <em>Eileen</em> in such terms.</p> <p>But of course \u201cthis was only the beginning \u2026 then it turned into a work of its own\u201d. In Moshfegh\u2019s hands, an off-the-peg novel structure was warped and elevated into something unique. For a start, the narrator, an elderly Eileen looking back to 1964, plays fictional games. And while the book has fun with suspense and noir cliche \u2013 Rebecca, the redhead, is more an idea than a fully developed presence \u2013 it is full of astounding and funny sentences that only Moshfegh could have written. Most importantly, the central character is an unforgettable and distinctively dark creation.</p> <p>Eileen as a 24-year-old is miserable, full of anger and self-loathing. She wakes up next to her vomit after a heavy night\u2019s drinking. She hates her alcoholic father and wishes him dead. Though obsessed by her plainness, she wears her dead mother\u2019s frumpy clothes. She touches herself and smells her fingers. She hasn\u2019t yet dared to have sex, but stalks her fantasy man and believes her first time \u201cwould be by force\u201d. Her house is filthy and she eats terrible food, when she eats at all. Addicted to laxatives, she tells of her basement toilet purging: \u201ctorrential, oceanic, as though all of my insides had melted and were now gushing out \u2026 Those were the good times.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/eileen-by-ottessa-moshfegh-review-bell-jar\">Eileen by Ottessa Moshfegh review \u2013 an odd double of Plath's Bell Jar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This isn\u2019t unfamiliar ground for Moshfegh. The wonderful <em>McGlue</em> is written as the internal monologue of a self-harming sailor, accused of murder, who can\u2019t keep food down and who has nearly drunk himself to death. And the stories in <em>Homesick for Another World</em>, her collection to be published in January, are, she says, \u201cmy first attempt to impress on people how weird it has been for me to feel alive. And I do that by using these puppets who are struggling with their absurd miseries.\u201d Moshfegh told Vice magazine: \u201cMy writing lets people scrape up against their own depravity, but at the same time it\u2019s very refined \u2026 It\u2019s like seeing Kate Moss take a shit.\u201d</p> <p>The vast majority of critics have embraced <em>Eileen</em>, but one used the words \u201cqueasy\u201d and \u201cgratuitous\u201d. When I ask Moshfegh about the reception of the novel, she rails against those who \u201cwant to know in this juicy way why I have written such an unlikable character. I just want to say: \u2018How dare you?\u2019\u201d We live in a world in which mass murderers are re-elected, she says, yet it\u2019s an unlikable female character that is found to be offensive: it\u2019s \u201csexist and idiotic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAt the same time, I get it,\u201d she continues. \u201cEileen is a character that makes people uncomfortable. She is not going to, you know, cheer you up. But might it not be liberating to hear the thoughts of someone who is completely ignored by society?\u201d Those readers or reviewers who focus on Eileen\u2019s unlikability, she believes, \u201cprobably felt ashamed\u201d when reading the book, and are unable to confront their own more debased impulses.</p> <p>Moshfegh has said before that \u201cmost people who pick up a book labelled \u2018thriller\u2019 or \u2018mystery\u2019 may not be expecting to confront troubling ideas about women in society \u2026 I couldn\u2019t be like, Here\u2019s my <em>freak</em> book \u2026 So I\u2019ve disguised the ugly truth in a kind of spiffy noir package.\u201d The \u201cgreat irony\u201d is that, to her, \u201cEileen is not perverse. I think she\u2019s totally normal \u2026 I haven\u2019t written a freak character; I\u2019ve written an honest character.\u201d</p> <p>When I mention the importance of drink in <em>Eileen</em> and her other work, Moshfegh tells me she \u201cdrank alcoholically\u201d for five years from the age of 17 or 18, \u201cand then spent eight years in AA thinking deeply about alcoholism \u2026 One of the first things you hear when you go to AA is that it\u2019s not a cult, but it <em>is</em> a cult. I was indoctrinated, I was hard core.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve had eating issues since adolescence and there\u2019s nothing in my work that I haven\u2019t thoroughly researched privately</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And the problematic relationship between food and the body that features in her writing? \u201cI\u2019ve had eating issues since adolescence, and while I don\u2019t enjoy speaking about this publicly, I can say that there\u2019s nothing in my work that I haven\u2019t thoroughly researched privately.\u201d As for Eileen\u2019s body obsession, she has said it\u2019s hardly surprising, even inevitable: we \u201clive in a culture of objectification \u2026 women are judged by appearance first. This is why I\u2019m not putting my photo on my book jacket.\u201d</p> <p>The bleakness of Eileen\u2019s life is prolonged and taken to such a level it\u2019s almost black comedy. In conversation, Moshfegh is funny about the trials of existence, and her short stories have been acclaimed for their comic timing. \u201cI used to be much funnier in person,\u201d she deadpans. \u201cI used to be hysterically funny. There was a period in my 20s when I was a crack-up.\u201d But she insists that even if Eileen\u2019s misery and self-hatred might \u201cbegin to seem absurd \u2026 that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not real\u201d.</p> <p>People are constantly being \u201cabused, enslaved\u201d, she has said. It happens all around us, every day, but \u201cwe\u2019ve become numb, so we do nothing\u201d. <em>Eileen</em>, which revolves around a juvenile prison, and the particular motivation for a patricide, is shaped by this anger. Then again, Moshfegh says she is \u201ccompletely fatigued and sick\u201d of having to talk about the novel as an \u201cobject containing \u2018issues\u2019\u201d. For her it was an experiment, and a year on from its publication, she\u2019s very \u201chappy for it\u201d, but it is only one project among many.</p> <p>***</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I could unplug my internet completely I would \u2026 I value my brain \u2026 In the long term I want my writing to be important</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moshfegh has described herself as \u201ca lurker on the edge of society \u2026 looking at the world\u201d and thinking: \u201cwhat a weird show\u201d. She was born in Boston to a Croatian mother and an Iranian father, both professional musicians. Her mother\u2019s parents joined partisan armies to fight the Nazis; her paternal grandfather \u201cowned half of Tehran\u201d before the family was forced to leave, with all assets seized, in the Iranian revolution of 1978-9. Her family was culturally rich but financially poor within an affluent Bostonian neighbourhood: Moshfegh was ashamed of their rusting car, but read the complete works of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/24/hermann-hesse-steppenwolf-review\">Hermann Hesse</a> at an alarmingly young age, and was playing four instruments by the time she was seven.</p> <p>\u201cMy family\u2019s values seemed very different from the values of the world I was living in,\u201d she recalls. As a child, she always felt removed: \u201cI had this epiphany when I was five, sitting on the carpet in kindergarten listening to Mrs Balfour trying to teach us how to read the clock. It dawned on me that time was passing and we were all going to be dead \u2013 what\u2019s the point? So I had that realisation, and then people were telling me to put my crayons away. And to get in line, and to smile. And I thought this was total bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>Her sense of alienation is expressed with humour, but is genuine and profound. \u201cI felt like I was living in hell for most of my childhood and adolescence and my 20s,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a brief period in my early 30s when I felt life was OK, and now it feels like hell again. The shape the hell took is precisely what my work is about.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/28/ottessa-moshfegh-eileen-noir-novel-musical-family-school-interview\">Ottessa Moshfegh: I didn\u2019t set out to write Eileen as a noir novel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moshfegh gave up music when \u201cthe discipline and intensity\u201d it required was channelled into her writing. After her college years in New York \u2013 \u201chumiliating\u201d \u2013 she \u201clived a life\u201d in her 20s: \u201cI got jobs, fell in love, moved to China for two years, fell out of love, got other jobs.\u201d She dates the beginning of her writing \u201ccareer\u201d to her MFA course at Brown University, during which, in 2010-2011, she wrote <em>McGlue</em>: \u201cLooking back I\u2019m astonished that I wrote it, I think it\u2019s an astonishing book.\u201d</p> <p>Writing the hallucinatory novella \u2013 which is both a celebration of rhythm and language, and a historical gay love story with exotic locations \u2013 \u201calmost felt like an exorcism\u201d. Before it was published, she had already begun the series of stories to be included in <em>Homesick for Another World</em>, which led to recognition, awards and fellowships.</p> <p>The first story in the collection, \u201cBettering Myself\u201d, is told in the voice of a damaged, alcoholic high-school teacher, who meets up with her former husband. According to Moshfegh, it \u201cis not so far from a true story. I\u2019m not the character. But \u2026 it came from very close to home.\u201d As did the fairytale-like final story, \u201cA Better Place\u201d, which concerns a young girl who, as the author describes it, \u201cfeels as though she\u2019s been lied to and \u2026 doesn\u2019t want to live in a world \u2026 at the mercy of others\u201d. The stories in between are highly varied and hugely entertaining, but most originate from a position of hostility or a difficult personal experience. Many of them skewer egomaniacal men and privileged people unaware of their bigotry.</p> <p>Even as her renown has increased, Moshfegh has expressed discomfort with becoming a literary personality. If the literary world was a high school, she told Vanity Fair, \u201cI would be sitting with the goths, looking at everyone, being, like, <em>Whatever</em>.\u201d She has given up Twitter and Facebook \u2013 \u201ctacky\u201d for a known author \u2013 and tells me \u201cif I could unplug my internet completely I would \u2026 I value my brain\u201d. But she is driven and ambitious \u2013 what matters is the work, especially the new novel she is deep into, set in the New York art world in 2000, in which a woman hibernates for a year: \u201cIn the long term,\u201d she says, \u201cI want my writing to be something important.\u201d</p> <p>There may be aspects of promoting her novel that she finds wearying, but \u2013 she smiles \u2013 she \u201cdoesn\u2019t mind being inconvenienced by the Booker\u201d, and has kept October free in her schedule in case. (If an American writer won it, she thinks, the media in the US would care more about the prize.) So what if, in some circles, <em>Eileen</em> gets bracketed with the bestselling thrillers by Flynn and Hawkins? \u201cTrying to protect its reputation as a postmodern work of art would not only be arrogant, but pointless.\u201d Besides, she retains a deep connection with her memorable and controversial central character, whom she grew to understand completely. Eileen \u201cis a living person\u201d, she says. \u201cAnd I have a feeling she\u2019s angry with me for talking behind her back.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Eileen</em> by Ottessa Moshfegh is published by Vintage.

So hunt like you are searching for Pok\u00e9mon and sniff out your flavour of \u2018freaks\u2019 in every corner, whether it\u2019s signing up to the Fencing Society, or galvanising everyone in your halls to start watching a Scrubs boxset. You never know, you might end up being best mates with that person who keeps leaving their pubes in the shower. <br><em>Gemma presents The Surgery on BBC Radio 1, Wednesdays, 9pm.

The trend of athleisure shows no sign of letting up and has even gone into its second iteration: splicing up bits of a smart look with a posh jogging bottom or a high-end-look hoodie with some sensible pants. There\u2019s also a market for retro tracksuits (think: Ray Liotta in Goodfellas) paired with, say, some reissued Gazelles. Just don\u2019t let anyone tell you you look like Loadsamoney. </p> <h2><strong>HOW TO MAKE THE PERFECT HANGOVER MEAL</strong></h2> <p><strong>By </strong><strong>Yotam</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Ottolenghi</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>chef</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bed5d8da9b6e50f736b777e3d4375decc4cde5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bed5d8da9b6e50f736b777e3d4375decc4cde5f/0_304_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mmm.

Braised, if possible, in a tomato sauce. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/19/yotam-ottolenghi-breakfast-recipe-shakshuka\">Shakshuka is the ultimate for mopping up sore heads</a>. Make a big batch of the sauce in advance: diced red pepper and onions in a pan for a long slow cook with a couple of cans of tomatoes, some ground cumin, a pinch of cayenne or some chopped red chilli \u2013 and then you are all set to go. Add the sauce to your pan, make however many wells you want for the eggs (four or five works well for two people) and use a fork to whirl the white of the egg through the sauce. Braise on a low heat with the pan covered until the whites are just set and the yolk still has a wobble. Serve as it is, with some crusty white bread. You can also tailor the sauce on the day with whatever you have around: the salt from some chunks of fried bacon are sometimes a must. Chopped parsley or coriander also adds requisite green if your body is crying out for it. </p> <h2><strong>HOW TO KNOW WHETHER TO DROP OUT</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Laura</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Snapes, writer</strong></p> <p>University is not always the time of your life \u2013 and that\u2019s OK. Lowered expectations are generally a decent survival technique, though it\u2019s vital to recognise when everyday crapness becomes untenable: a disappointing course, crushing mental health or hunger for life beyond nursing off Wetherspoons\u2019 midweek drinks deals at 9am lectures. Your parents will freak when you quit, but tell them that companies are increasingly dropping degree requirements for job applicants. And, besides, you can always go back as a mature student (when it\u2019ll be so expensive, you\u2019ll make better choices anyway). </p> <h2><strong>HOW TO</strong><strong> START A REVOLUTION </strong></h2> <p><strong>By Owen Jones, writer</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eef61a217346313a5e93b946653fa945c5d09546\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eef61a217346313a5e93b946653fa945c5d09546/0_499_1370_821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Lindsay as Citizen Smith hi000580493.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"41a41294656f0d81385ad563d2181c42bf5e14df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a41294656f0d81385ad563d2181c42bf5e14df/309_145_2392_1434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Jones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starting a revolution is both an excellent hangover cure and a convenient distraction from the library. It doesn\u2019t mean spending the afternoon shelling the Palace of Westminster. But joining a living wage campaign for university cleaners, getting involved in a single-issue group on, say, tax justice or racism, or signing up to a political party (cough, except the Tories or Ukip, cough) \u2013 these can all help create a peaceful revolution to change society. A skilfully crafted placard \u2013 featuring such classics as \u201cI wish my boyfriend was as dirty as your policies\u201d or \u201cWhat do we want? Things to be better! When do we want it? Within a reasonable timeframe!\u201d \u2013 is a must.

And check that the society doesn\u2019t already exist. Try to grab people\u2019s attention. At Freshers\u2019 Fair, we have costumes, swords and walk around campus \u201chassling\u201d people.

In 2006 we did a show at the Edinburgh Fringe which one critic described as \u201cnot as bad as I\u2019d expected\u201d. This led me to take up stand-up comedy, which is now my job. Here are five tips on getting started as a student.</p> <p><strong>1. </strong>Audition \u2013 if there is a group, then great! Go along to auditions. If you don\u2019t get in, go again. Refuse to take a hint. <br><strong>2. </strong>If there isn\u2019t a group, set one up. My friends started a night at a local pub, which is where I did my first standup gig. So if you hate my comedy it\u2019s their fault.<br><strong>3. </strong>Experiment. Feel free to be terrible. Due to the vast quantities of alcohol students consume, no one will remember.<br><strong>4. </strong>Get yourself to the fringe. It\u2019s the best place to learn. <br><strong>5. </strong>DO IT. <strong><br></strong><em>Nish Kumar\u2019s Actions Speak Louder Than Words, Unless You Shout The Words Real Loud tour starts 1 Oct</em></p> <h2><strong>HOW TO WIN A BATTLE OF THE BANDS</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Tarek and Pete from Spring King</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"867a8e5afa330c7bc036113747d75ea83bf36893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/867a8e5afa330c7bc036113747d75ea83bf36893/0_49_4414_2649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spring King\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spring King</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Isaac/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Always bribe the judges with alcohol.

Keep puns to a minimum and keep your clothes on. Finish on an Oasis song.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>By Theo from Wolf Alice</strong></p> <p>Solely rely on your bands look. In our Instagram reliant age, your \u201cswag\u201d is elementary. Skechers are a great starting point as they\u2019re a timeless shoe. Some spray on skinnies are another \u201cindie essential\u201dessential. Yellow or red are my legging of choice. Your torso should always be adorned by either a draping faux retro shirt and or band t-shirt (doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t listen to the band you\u2019re representing). Finish the look with a classique Jack Sparrow fedora. This will signify you as a musical era crossing vagabond. If you follow these effective and concise style tips you will be snapped up by every indie A&amp;R for at least a three-month contract. </p> <h2><strong>HOW TO GET ON WITH THE NEIGHBOURS</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Tom Rosenthal, comedian</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f526c24a39d1fe111da81b30fa569c52a7ba0ab3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f526c24a39d1fe111da81b30fa569c52a7ba0ab3/0_163_2263_1356/1000.jpg\" alt=\"G\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cbc2e0bd7ef9803742988d702af9a0c39893c74e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbc2e0bd7ef9803742988d702af9a0c39893c74e/0_188_3280_1967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Rosenthal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Rosenthal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Idil Sukan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Make sure to turn up any music or television you are listening to so your neighbours can enjoy it, too.

Be as niche as you want to be and think small. Work on getting an amazing poster rather than a finding a DJ who can mix. If you make something that is true to you then like-minded people will naturally find it.

Don\u2019t rely on dating apps<br></strong>Tinder, Happn, Grindr: all great ways to avoid your dissertation, sure, but don\u2019t forget The Real World. You\u2019ve only got a few years to make the most of uni, so save the apps for later. Think of campus as one giant Tinder!</p> <p><strong>2. Do date someone who cooks <br></strong>\u2026because date night may be the best meal you get all week. And don\u2019t forget to demonstrate your own value. Throw parties. Decorate your communal space with vibrant colours (and if you take that to mean dyeing your pubic hair lavender, so be it). Basically, be a person that people want to be around, and you\u2019ll never want for admirers.</p> <p><strong>3. Do be aware of proximity<br></strong>If you live in a shared house, it\u2019s best not to fall for the person in the room directly beneath yours. If things go wrong between you, you\u2019ll have to spend the next few terms playing Adele to drown out the sound of them having sex with better-looking people. No one wants a year of Adele on full blast. See also: don\u2019t date your housemate\u2019s exes. Seriously, what are you, a masochist?</p> <p><strong>4. Do be careful sharing photos on phone apps<br></strong>There isn\u2019t a Snapchat filter on Earth that\u2019ll make you feel better when your private parts end up the subject of a WhatsApp group discussion with the bellends from media studies. You may not care that much now, but spare a thought for future you. Spoiler: Future you is not impressed.</p> <p><strong>5. Don\u2019t settle down too quickly<br></strong>Love is lovely, but don\u2019t stress about meeting The One. If you\u2019re ever going to have a wild phase, this is it. Uni is for experimenting and having fun and finding yourself, sometimes in other people\u2019s beds. Just try not to get a disease?

There seem to be a few things at work: gastric irritation; the effects of the acetaldehyde (the main breakdown product of alcohol), which is extremely toxic; tiredness. Perhaps least understood is how much alcohol is lovely and soothing for your brain \u2013 like it\u2019s having a soak in a nice hot bath with candles and rose petals. Because it\u2019s relaxing in the booze, your brain seems to make a lot less of the chemicals that it usually makes to help soothe itself. This is a problem, because when the alcohol goes away, it\u2019s like you\u2019re suddenly taken out of a hot bath and plunged into a freezing lake of sewage. There\u2019s none of those nice calming neurotransmitters around. They\u2019re taking a break. All the sweaty, anxious, paranoid, palpitations, dry mouth dry eyes stuff \u2013 that\u2019s probably all happening in your brain. It\u2019s not dehydration. Unless you did a lot of dancing. So by all means have a pint of squash and take some painkillers, but what you really need for your jangled brain is pleasure. Sex, food, TV, or ideally a combination of all three. Ideally in large quantities. <strong><br></strong><em>The Doctor Who Gave Up Drugs\u2019 Fronted by Chris van Tulleken airs Thursday, 9pm BBC1</em></p> <h2><strong>HOW TO </strong><strong>WRITE THE PERFECT PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE FRIDGE NOTE</strong></h2> <p><strong>By a selection of top UK standups</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62a32fe1524955464f44c6bc60fe24559ca00d4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62a32fe1524955464f44c6bc60fe24559ca00d4a/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"fridge note\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blank TO DO post-it note on a red fridge door<br>http://www.primarypicture.com/iStock/IS_Fridge.jpg</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mrPliskin/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Elis James<br></strong>Hey!!!

This was neatly exemplified by Imelda Marcos\u2019 commitment to buying shoes, as the poor starved to death moments away from the presidential palace. In contrast, Duterte has painted himself as a man of the people over the course of a staggering seven terms as mayor of , Davao City, his home town.</p> <p>First appointed after Ferdinand Marcos\u2019s administration was toppled by the people power revolution in 1986, Duterte\u2019s tough but fair leadership has been credited for Davao\u2019s plummeting crime rates.

In contrast, Duterte was not only swift to deliver aid to Tacloban, one of the worst-hit areas but personally visited the devastation, giving a tearful speech criticising local government\u2019s inertia.</p> <p>Similarly, days after his now infamous \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx8MG5z5PPAhUIIsAKHU65CKoQFggkMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2016%2Fsep%2F06%2Fson-of-a-whore-was-not-meant-to-be-personal-duterte-tells-obama&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRJdKz0TW-x5wRo_rAnM-DziQqzA&amp;sig2=DXMnux7sEHPbWO0Hphv5gw\">son of a whore</a>\u201d comment to President Barack Obama, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/deadly-blast-philippines-night-market-davao\">a bomb blast in Davao City killed 15</a>. Within hours of the attack, photos of Duterte at the scene talking to victims were circulating on social media, again praising him for being on the ground. As indisputably dangerous as Duterte is, he is a foul-mouthed, cracking-jokes-about-shooting-people breath of fresh air the Philippines has never experienced before.</p> <p>Duterte\u2019s mass execution of the low hanging fruit in the Philippines drug trade will serve only to highlight how drugs have filled the vacuum created by successive governments.

  "<p>Following the UK\u2019s decision to exit the European Union, more people than ever are wondering if the grass is a little greener elsewhere in Europe, or perhaps even further afield. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/hold-off-applying-for-passport-ireland-tells-britons\">surge in applications for Irish</a> and other EU passports suggests many Britons are keen to carry on enjoying unfettered access to work opportunities within Europe.</p> <p>With so many varied and interesting countries to choose from, deciding where to pack up and move to can be hard. Thanks to open data on what it is like to live in different cities, some of the guesswork has already been done. After combining a range of publicly available datasets, for example, it turns out the UK rates as pretty average when it comes to good work-life balance and the amount of money a typical worker loses as a result of traffic congestion. It will come as no surprise to discover that compared with the rest of the world, London is one of the most expensive places to study.</p> <p>These insights are made possible by analytics companies combining datasets and adding a human element to typically economic figures. Through this they can gain insight into what it is actually like to work in different cities.</p> <p>For budding tech leaders, a useful case study comes from Bobbi Brant, a researcher at <a href=\"http://www.expertmarket.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ExpertMarket.com</a>. She decided to see if the assumption that Silicon Valley is the only tech hub to head for stands up to scrutiny. She combined each major tech hub\u2019s reputation for launching startups, the level of finance raised, salary levels and time taken to launch a company, information available from startup researchers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.compass.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Compass</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The World Bank\u2019s</a> open data service. She then cross-referenced lifestyle data from living index <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Numbeo</a> for the cost of living, rent levels, holiday entitlement and commute times. With the four economic and four personal datasets given even weighting, it was a surprise to find that San Francisco was not the number one tech hub in the world. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.expertmarket.com/focus/research/top-tech-hubs\" rel=\"nofollow\">That honour fell to Berlin</a>.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of reports into tech hubs are based on economic data but that\u2019s of more use to investors than young people starting out on a career,\u201d she points out. \u201cIt\u2019s no good looking to work in the hub with most investment if you can\u2019t afford to live there or the work-life balance is wrong for you. So, when you add data on affordability and lifestyle, Berlin comes out top with Silicon Valley in fourth spot. London\u2019s way down the table at 16th because of the high cost of living.\u201d</p> <h2>Better balance</h2> <p>Similar recent studies from ExpertMarket.com have also named the city where workers can expect the best work-life balance and parents will lose the least sleep fretting about paying university fees. For each study the site\u2019s content manager, Jessica Laporte, started with open data on average earnings from Swiss bank UBS. For the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blog.expertmarket.co.uk/work-life-balance\" rel=\"nofollow\">education project</a> they were correlated with average university fees and college rankings from researchers at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2016\" rel=\"nofollow\">QS</a>. For the work-life balance <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blog.expertmarket.co.uk/work-life-balance\" rel=\"nofollow\">project</a>, the amount of holiday people take was combined with average earnings figures. In both studies, France won.</p> <p>\u201cParis is obviously the place to work and study because the French work more than a thousand hours fewer than Hong Kong, which provided the worst work-life balance,\u201d Brant says.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is 17th out of 70 countries and so not nearly as bad as some people who feel overworked might suspect. France is also the most affordable country, where fees apply, for parents to fund their children through university, with the Scandinavian countries all in good positions just behind it.\u201d</p> <h2>Stuck in traffic</h2> <p>Combining extra datasets gives an extra understanding around commute times, or rather the implications behind congestion. Josh Frisby, content manager at vehicle tracking company Global Positioning Specialists, combined average salaries around the world with data on commuting distance at Numbeo alongside congestion levels published by TomTom. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gps.com.au/earnings-lost-to-congestion-around-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">result</a> was a table for the cities where workers driving to the office waste the most amount of time, in terms of wages lost to traffic jams. Mexico City was way out ahead as the worst but, surprisingly, British and American cities did not perform as badly as Frisby had expected.</p> <p>\u201cIn Mexico City the average person could earn nearly 10% more if they weren\u2019t stuck in traffic jams,\u201d says Frisby. \u201cWe were really surprised that Los Angeles and New York only came out 19th and 26th respectively and that London is only the 16th worst city for the cost of traffic jams. It was also surprising to see that Manchester was just behind the capital in 20th place, meaning people lose more money in Manchester driving to work in heavy traffic than they do in cities you would presume would be much worse, such as New York, San Francisco, Paris and Singapore.\u201d</p> <h2>Apac cost of living</h2> <p>Anyone considering moving further afield, as far as Australia or the wider Asia Pacific area, might want to check out a new, free online service which compares the cost of living in eight of the region\u2019s major cities. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://webapps.qlik.com/costofliving-apac/index.html#/\" rel=\"nofollow\">comparison website</a> has been launched by data analyst company Qlik. Senior solution architect Stephen Street explains the service uses a combination of data services, such as Numbeo and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PropertyGuru</a> to enable a like-for-like comparison between the region\u2019s top business destinations.</p> <p>\u201cWe want the service to be truly useful to anyone comparing Apac cities,\u201d Street says. \u201cSo we have a general, average comparison, where Tokyo is the most expensive city and Mumbai is far and away the cheapest. However, we also allow people to tailor the data to their lifestyle. You can compare the cost of living for someone who likes to eat out and drink, or perhaps buy designer clothes. Then Singapore and Sydney become more expensive to live in than Tokyo. As you change the settings the table changes so you can match your lifestyle to the city that appeals the most.\u201d</p> <p>Before the era of open data, comparing what it is like to live and work in different cities was largely a case of testimonials from locals and expats. However, now, anyone wondering if they could have a better standard of living abroad can find out online from a combination of data sources. Ironically, the open data projects may well persuade many that the UK is not such a bad place after all. </p> <p>However, for those who are determined to have it all \u2013 low-cost education, low congestion and a good work-life balance \u2013 it may well be time to dust off the French phrasebook and head for the Eurostar.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>I received the most precious gift I could have ever hoped for when Theresa May announced that my son Gary McKinnon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-not-extradited-may\" title=\"\">would not be extradited</a> to the US for alleged computer hacking. Our absolute joy and sense of relief felt by this decision cannot be overestimated.</p> <p>When our then home secretary had the courage to use the Human Rights Act to protect Gary and to simultaneously announce the introduction of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/06/home-secretary-overhauls-extradition-laws\" title=\"\">new rules</a>, so that anyone physically in the UK when their alleged crime occurred could now ostensibly be tried here. However, much of the decision-making in this regard has unfortunately been left in the hands of the CPS and judges, who tend to approve extradition to the US regardless of a proposed inhumane sentence or lack of evidence.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/sep/16/lauri-love-uk-court-us-extradition-hacker-accused\" title=\"\">extradition decision</a> today on Lauri Love, a 31-year-old with Asperger\u2019s syndrome accused by the US of hacking, was the first real test case of May\u2019s new system, established with the intention of providing protection from unnecessary extradition. It fell at the first hurdle. Judge Nina Tempia ruled that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/sep/16/computer-activist-lauri-love-loses-appeal-against-us-extradition\" title=\"\">Lauri will be extradited</a>.</p> <p>This protection is much needed, as the Human Rights Act, which does often come into play to prevent deportation to home countries, is rarely ever used by our courts to prevent extradition to the US, even in cases of highly vulnerable British citizens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/sep/16/lauri-love-uk-court-us-extradition-hacker-accused\">UK court to decide on extradition of 'hacker' Lauri Love</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The decision on Gary, who also has Asperger\u2019s, was a momentous one, and the introduction of the safeguards gave us all hope that other vulnerable computer geeks living in the UK would in the future be much more likely to stand trial in Britain.</p> <p>No American has been extradited for a crime that took place when they were physically on American soil. In those cases they are automatically tried in their own country, as we hoped British citizens would now be.</p> <p>So what\u2019s gone wrong? Once again we are seeing the sight of a vulnerable man facing the threat of extradition and an obscene 99-year prison sentence, as his life hangs in the balance. There is no doubt that for Lauri Love\u2019s parents, even the threat of losing their son is a living hell.</p> <p>Gary\u2019s dad died after May\u2019s decision and there is no doubt of the strain our 10-year fight put on him. Fortunately he lived to see his son walk free and for that we are hugely grateful. Lauri\u2019s dad is a prison chaplain. He has a heart condition and a huge toll is being taken on his health, as it is on Lauri\u2019s. Lauri\u2019s mum is a teacher who works with prisoners \u2013 it is ironic that people who have devoted their lives to helping others are now in this terrifying position.</p> <p>When I was at my lowest ebb good people out there instinctively knew I needed help, and help me they did. We came together to create a force of good to save Gary, and against all the odds we did just that. I\u2019ve always believed that good exists in even the darkest of corners and just knowing that it can win against the most powerful odds is a heartening thing.</p> <p>Although Gary is now safe, Lauri is not and he and his family desperately need help. It may be a naive dream but it would be the most wonderful thing if the American prosecutors and our government could find it in their hearts to give Lauri and his family closure by dropping or blocking the extradition request and ruling that the CPS should try Lauri in the UK if he has a case to answer.</p> <p>Simple acts of compassion and kindness are what bring people and nations together, of that there is no doubt. For British people to see that we are given the same rights as our American cousins would be something to behold and would show the vulnerable that they matter. Asking to be tried by your own peers is surely a reasonable request.</p> <p>A young American computer genius, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/07/aaron-swartz-suicide-internets-own-boy\" title=\"\">Aaron Swartz</a>, was driven to a state of mental torment and sadly took his own life when facing a lengthy prison sentence. Prosecutors in the US, Aaron\u2019s own country, would not allow him to plea bargain, and the increasing mental torment became too much for Aaron to bear. Our world badly needs some fairytale endings, rather than the unnecessary risk of the suicide of our geeks, our vulnerable, our geniuses who are after all, our future</p> <p>When Gary was under threat he was permanently nervous and said that he\u2019d forgotten what happiness felt like, but fortunately humanity shone on him and saved his life. Seeing him smile for the first time in years was truly something to behold.</p> <p>The support through difficult times means so much to someone whose life is in limbo. The good that exists in our world and the power of the people in it can and does achieve miracles. Please help Lauri to achieve that miracle and to remain in the UK, close to his family. Every letter sent, comment made and article written, every tweet tweeted, phone call made, and demo attended helps to keep the spirit alive and contributes to hope that his freedom is on the horizon.</p> <p>Lauri has not been convicted of any crime and extradition is a cruel punishment of man with Asperger\u2019s who is after all, innocent until proven guilty, hopefully by a jury of his peers.</p> <p>We burned our witches. Don\u2019t crucify our geeks.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article was updated on Friday 16 September at 7.30pm, following the verdict</em></p>",

Covering global stories, the series will focus on films that address contemporary issues and raise awareness of both people and movements making a difference in the world.<br></p> <p>Led by Charlie Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s head of documentaries in collaboration with Rebecca Lichtenfeld of the Bertha Foundation, the standalone section will feature a high quality video player which spans the full width of the screen on mobile, tablet and desktop, offering audiences a beautifully designed, cinematic viewing experience. The Guardian\u2019s in-house team will work closely with independent filmmakers from all across the world with embedded access to, and deep knowledge of, the communities in which they are filming to produce an eclectic mix of thought-provoking films covering a diverse range of topics such as sport, migration and protest.<br></p> <p>The first film launched in the section, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/sep/16/gun-nation-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-americas-gun-culture-video\">Gun Nation</a>, follows photojournalist Zed Nelson as he revisits the gun owners and people affected by guns he photographed for his book of the same name 18 years ago.

  "<p>The European Union is in a critical situation, Angela Merkel has said, as she arrived in Bratislava for a special summit \u2013 without the UK \u2013 that hopes to set a new course for a project battered by Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to show with our actions that we can get better,\u201d the German chancellor said. The bloc had to improve \u201cin the domain of security, internal and external security, the fight against terrorism, the cooperation in the field of defence\u201d, as well as defence and jobs, she added. </p> <p>Donald Tusk, the European council president who chairs EU leaders\u2019 summits, hopes to cool tempers in Slovakia after Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister called for Hungary to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/expel-hungary-from-eu-for-hostility-to-refugees-says-luxembourg\">thrown out of the EU</a> for allegedly treating asylum seekers \u201cworse than wild animals\u201d. Hungary counterattacked with stinging criticism of the grand duchy\u2019s record in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale\">helping big corporations avoid tax</a>.</p> <p>On the eve of the summit, Tusk called on EU leaders to take a \u201cbrutally honest\u201d look at the bloc\u2019s problems, declaring: \u201cWe must not let this crisis go to waste.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t come to Bratislava to comfort each other or even worse to deny the real challenges we face in this particular moment in the history of our community after the vote in the UK,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t start our discussion ... with this kind of blissful conviction that nothing is wrong, that everything was and is OK,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have to assure ... our citizens that we have learned the lesson from Brexit and we are able to bring back stability and a sense of security and effective protection.\u201d</p> <p>The Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, who is hosting the summit, said the leaders \u201call want to show unity\u201d but warned that it would not be easy.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Brexit and the risks connected with Brexit, it is absolutely necessary to me to be very honest,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Tusk hopes to focus on areas that the 27 leaders can agree on: border security, counter-terrorism and moves to \u201cbring back control of globalisation\u201d. Officials are playing down expectations of results from the meeting at Bratislava castle, in the capital of Slovakia, one of the four Visegr\u00e1d countries along with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. <br></p> <p>The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, promised that the Visegr\u00e1d group would present a plan to tackle the EU\u2019s problems, which he said would \u201cbe an important moment in the life of these four countries\u201d.</p> <p>In a radio interview released on Friday morning, Orb\u00e1n also said he expected migration pressure to increase in the Balkans again, once the weather worsens and sea routes to Italy become more difficult.</p> <p>Officials close to Tusk hope for small but symbolic breakthroughs, most notably an agreement to send an extra 200 border guards and 50 vehicles to the EU\u2019s external frontier in Bulgaria by next month.</p> <p>Agreeing on stronger border defences may prove easier than sharing the cost of protecting refugees, which is likely to continue to strain unity. Visegr\u00e1d group members are fiercely opposed to the EU executive\u2019s attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/03/eu-refugee-crisis-closed-door-countries-pay-solidarity-contributions\">fine them for not accepting refugees</a> in their countries. Hungary has flatly refused to take in refugees under an EU quota scheme, while many other countries are falling short.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n has called a referendum for 2 October on the EU relocation plan, under which the country would accept 1,294 asylum seekers.</p> <p>Before the vote, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, appeared to offer an olive branch to his opponents. In his annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/juncker-european-unity-brexit-vote-eu\">state of the union address,</a> he said solidarity \u201cmust come from the heart\u201d and could not be forced. One EU source said it was too early to say what this meant for the policy, describing it as \u201ca semi step back by the commission that might be a useful way out\u201d. Another EU official said the dispute was \u201ca cancer we have to cure\u201d.</p> <p>In the citadel that towers over the Danube, Tusk will brief leaders on his recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/donald-tusk-theresa-may-article-50-brexit-negotiations-eu\">meeting with the British prime minister</a>, Theresa May, although officials say there is little to report. The EU refuses to negotiate with the UK until the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/government-awaits-first-legal-opposition-to-brexit-in-high-court\">government triggers article 50</a>, a position that is likely to be reaffirmed at the summit. EU leaders are also likely to repeat the mantra that Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/brussels-eu-summit-leaders-push-quick-divorce-cameron-germany-brexit\">must accept freedom of movement</a> in order to gain access to the single market.<br></p> <p>In a recent letter to EU leaders, Tusk said it would be \u201ca fatal error\u201d to assume that the UK vote was a specifically British issue, describing it as \u201ca desperate attempt to answer the questions that millions of Europeans ask themselves daily\u201d about security, cultural heritage and way of life.<br></p> <p>This view is found across EU institutions. \u201cBrexit is a symptom of broader issues,\u201d one EU diplomat said. \u201cIt is not as such the decisive factor, it is a wakeup call.\u201d</p> <p>Many Brussels insiders see little chance of repairing the bloc while France and Germany are preoccupied with elections in 2017. </p>",

He and his friends also sexually abused her on numerous occasions. The disorder imprisoned Alice; she couldn\u2019t answer the phone or go to the shops on her own. \u201cI would get triggered by something and I\u2019d shake or shiver,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The MDMA just pulls things out of you. There were times when I just sat up and started talking</p> <footer> <cite>Alice, clinical trial patient</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the years, she tried talking therapy, somatic therapy, and <a href=\"http://www.emdr.com/what-is-emdr/\">eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing</a> (EMDR), in which a therapist moves his or her fingers left and right in front of a patient\u2019s face as they recount their trauma (the eye movements seem to dampen the memories). Nothing worked.</p> <p>Then, two and a half years ago, Alice enrolled in a clinical trial for a treatment combining psychotherapy with MDMA, near her home town of Erie, Colorado. She took 125mg of the drug, the same dose a clubber might take recreationally, three times over the course of 12 weeks. Her \u201ctrips\u201d were accompanied by eight-hour therapy sessions. \u201cI sat on a comfy couch and my therapist gave me a pill in a little handmade ceramic cup,\u201d she says. \u201cIt had a ritualistic feel to it. I was terrified the first time.\u201d Having taken the capsule, Alice was given an eye mask and headphones, and lay back listening to drum music until the drug, which she\u2019d never taken before, kicked in.</p> <p>\u201cThe MDMA just pulls things out of you,\u201d she says now. \u201cIt supports you. You can start looking at all your experiences and how they are affecting you. There were times when I just sat up and started talking. Or I\u2019d cry. Or there were moments of re-enactment. Physically, I felt like my whole body was vibrating for a while.\u201d</p> <p>During the session, her psychiatrist guided the conversation according to goals she had set with Alice beforehand. \u201cI had the first few minutes of peace I\u2019ve had in years,\u201d Alice says, though the sessions weren\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cSome parts were wonderful and others were kind of hellacious. I was super-sad and couldn\u2019t stop crying. It was not just an automatic love drug. But I was always able to come back to feeling good.\u201d</p> <p>Alice\u2019s recovery was astonishing. The gold-standard assessment tool for this kind of trauma is the clinician-administered PTSD scale, or Caps, which uses a lengthy questionnaire to determine the severity of a patient\u2019s symptoms (sample question: have there been times when you felt emotionally numb or had trouble experiencing feelings like love or happiness?). Any score over 60 is \u201csevere\u201d. Alice\u2019s score went from 106 to two. It\u2019s now at zero. In other words, her PTSD is gone.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Alice is one of 136 patients who have undergone MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in trials run by the not-for-profit <a href=\"http://www.maps.org/\">Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</a> (Maps), based in Santa Cruz, California. Maps was founded in 1986 by <a href=\"http://www.maps.org/about/board\">Rick Doblin</a>, then a trainee therapist, and now an effervescent 62-year-old who has dedicated his life to studying the medical uses of psychedelic drugs, including psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and marijuana. \u201cIt\u2019s taken 30 years to get to this point,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always known MDMA would work, but it\u2019s been really gratifying to see such tremendous results.\u201d He has studies nearing completion in Vancouver, Colorado, South Carolina and Israel, with plans for more in Australia.</p> <p>Doblin and his colleagues want to make the drug a prescription medicine. It is currently listed as a Schedule 1 substance by the US <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/index.shtml\">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA) and a Class A drug by the Home Office in the UK, along with heroin, cocaine and LSD. So far, the Maps studies have been relatively small, but the results are encouraging. One South Carolina study involved 20 patients, mostly victims of sexual abuse, who had suffered from PTSD for more than 19 years. It was a placebo-controlled study, so all patients were given the same therapy, but only some were given the MDMA; 83% of those given the MDMA no longer met the criteria for PTSD following treatment, compared with 25% of those who were not given the drug. Best of all? The results have held for several years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e4cdc76bc26f2b323820b3df7ed0df6d2504c23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e4cdc76bc26f2b323820b3df7ed0df6d2504c23/0_279_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Doblin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rick Doblin, founder of Maps, has spent 30 years studying the medical uses of psychedelic drugs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gretchen Ertl</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the real test will be next year\u2019s phase three trials, the final stage of validation required if MDMA-assisted therapy is to be legalised. (Around 50% of all medical treatments fail at this stage.) A phase three trial requires bigger groups, at least 230 people, around the world. Once two trials are completed, and provided the results still look positive, the data can be submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/\">FDA</a>) and the <a href=\"http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/\">European Medicines Agency</a> for approval. In theory, MDMA could be legalised for therapeutic use by 2021.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>MDMA is not a silver bullet: treatment is heavily reliant on the accompanying therapy, and there is a lot of therapy: three monthly sessions with the drug, lasting eight hours each, punctuated by nine weekly 90-minute sessions without it.</p> <p>International guidelines recommend the first line of treatment for PTSD should be EMDR or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/08/cognitive-behavioural-therapy\">cognitive behavioural therapy</a>; but it can be very hard to treat. \u201cPerhaps 50% of people will have resistance,\u201d says Jonathan Bisson, professor in psychiatry at Cardiff University. \u201cWe need new treatments.\u201d</p> <p>Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications are already big business for pharmaceutical companies. According to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18588361\">a 2008 US Veterans Association study</a>, about 80% of veterans diagnosed with PTSD are given psychiatric drugs. But <a href=\"http://time.com/3982440/ptsd-veterans/\">a 2015 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association</a> found that about two-thirds of veterans still meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis after treatment.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the US military continues to spend huge sums on drugs and disability payments. The Veterans Association says that, of the nearly 1.5 million former soldiers receiving compensation, 870,000 have PTSD, and their treatment costs the government as much as $17bn (\u00a312.7bn) a year. (In the UK, the Ministry of Defence pays \u00a3875m ($1.16bn) a year to those bereaved or injured through service; this figure covers mental and physical disability.) Doblin argues that if even a small portion of those funds were allocated to MDMA-assisted therapy, significant savings could be made. \u201cTo make MDMA into a medicine will cost around $30m,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it works, it could save hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars a year.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>MDMA use under medical supervision is a world away from someone necking a load of pills at a rave</p> <footer> <cite>Harry Shapiro, DrugWise</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If the FDA approves the drug, the DEA will have to decide whether to declassify it to Schedule 2, alongside morphine, opium and codeine \u2013 drugs that have a high potential for abuse but can be used under supervision. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/17/pennsylvania-legalizes-medical-marijuana\">medical marijuana has been legalised in many US states</a>. If MDMA were to follow the same pattern, it wouldn\u2019t be long before any entrepreneurial drug user could cry trauma to gain access to a steady stream of highly potent ecstasy. But Doblin stresses this won\u2019t happen. \u201cThese drugs are fundamentally different: marijuana is the treatment itself; we\u2019re talking about MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.\u201d</p> <p>These different approaches reflect the level of risk associated with the drugs. No one dies from a marijuana overdose; <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsrelatedtodrugpoisoninginenglandandwales/2015-09-03\">50 people died after taking MDMA in the UK in 2014</a> alone. There is no figure for MDMA-related deaths in the US, but there has been <a href=\"http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-ecstasy-teens.html\">a sharp rise in hospitalisations</a>, from around 4,500 people aged under 21 in 2005 to more than 10,000 in 2011, the latest data available.</p> <p>Used recreationally, MDMA is not without risk. \u201cIt mucks about with the body\u2019s thermostat and pushes up the body temperature, which can lead to organ failure and be fatal,\u201d explains Harry Shapiro, director of the UK charity DrugWise. \u201cBut its use under medical supervision is a world away from someone necking a load of pills at a rave.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>When James \u201cCJ\u201d Hardin, now 36, came back to the US from his tour of Iraq in 2006, he knew something was wrong. He was having nightmares and difficulty sleeping; loud sounds, crowds of people and flashes of light would send him into a state of anxiety. \u201cI\u2019d get tunnel vision and become hypervigilant, pulse racing and breath shallow.\u201d</p> <p>There were no flashbacks while he was awake, but he had nightmares about combat almost every night. He self-medicated with alcohol, combined with prescription sleeping pills and antidepressants. The Veterans Association offered CJ group therapy, but he found it a \u201cdick measuring contest\u201d, where participants engaged in one-upmanship over the atrocities they had experienced. When the sleeping pills became less effective, he also took the sedating antihistamine Benadryl, and drank rum until he passed out.</p> <p>After leaving the military in July 2010, CJ moved to North Carolina. \u201cI isolated myself and continued my bad habits, staying at home, drinking and smoking marijuana all day. Then I\u2019d wake up, eat and do it all again.\u201d A chance meeting with a Maps researcher led him to sign up for one of its studies \u2013 this one led by psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer and his wife Annie, a nurse, from their home and clinic in Charleston, South Carolina. The couple, now in their 60s, trained with the Czech psychedelic therapy pioneer <a href=\"http://www.stanislavgrof.com\">Stanislav Grof</a>, and have been working with MDMA since 2000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"091a33c50f508cebd7a60040a8c06bdcfa79ce7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/091a33c50f508cebd7a60040a8c06bdcfa79ce7c/137_142_822_493/500.jpg\" alt=\"James \u201cCJ\u201d Hardin\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James \u2018CJ\u2019 Hardin was having nightmares and difficulty sleeping after his tour of Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James \u201cCJ\u201d Hardin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By that time, CJ was having frequent suicidal thoughts: \u201cI\u2019d resigned myself to believing my life wasn\u2019t going to change.\u201d But during his first session, once the drug had taken effect, he started to open up about his trauma. \u201cAll of a sudden I knew I was safe. I realised I\u2019d been treating my life like I was in Iraq the whole time, when I\u2019m not. I am back in the US. That left me immediately.\u201d</p> <p>He was able to talk about his fears of mortar attacks, and how he felt in a constant state of peril, as if he might die at any moment. \u201cI felt like there was no light at the end of the tunnel. After that first session, the light clicked on. It wasn\u2019t right in front of me, but it was there. I had hope.\u201d The MDMA alone wouldn\u2019t have worked, he says; it was the catalyst that made the therapy work. \u201cIt disarmed me, opened my mind and allowed me to feel at peace and safe as I talked about the things I did. After years thinking you\u2019re a horrible person and not safe, it\u2019s the biggest vacation.\u201d</p> <p>Like Alice, CJ had three sessions. And, like Alice, his Caps score plummeted: from 87 to just seven, falling to three the following year.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/18/topstories3.drugsandalcohol\">MDMA (full name 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) was first synthesised in 1912</a> by the German pharmaceutical company Merck, which had been looking for a substance to stop bleeding. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that its potential was explored more fully, when a California chemist called Alexander Shulgin started to experiment with cooking up psychoactive drugs. He made a batch of MDMA and started testing it on himself. In 1976, following a 120mg dose, he wrote, \u201cI feel absolutely clean inside, and there is nothing but pure euphoria. I have never felt so great or believed this to be possible \u2026 I am overcome by the profundity of the experience.\u201d</p> <p>Shulgin introduced the drug to California psychotherapist Leo Zeff, who had previously developed LSD therapies. Zeff was so impressed by MDMA, describing it as \u201cpenicillin for the soul\u201d, that he came out of retirement to introduce the drug to therapists across America and Europe. But just as its therapeutic potential was being explored, it started to make its way into the rave scene; in 1985, it was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/us/us-will-ban-ecstasy-a-hallucinogenic-drug.html\">banned by the DEA</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMDMA is highly volatile in one person but not the next,\u201d says DEA spokesman Melvin Patterson. \u201cYou and I could both take it, and I would have no reaction and your organs would start to shut down. There were tons of raves happening, and a lot of people being rushed to hospital and packed in ice to get their temperature back to normal. It was rare that people overdosed or died, but it did happen, and at such a frequency that we had to step in.\u201d</p> <p>The Mithoefers began researching MDMA-assisted therapy in 2000. \u201cIt seemed to make particular sense for PTSD,\u201d Michael says. \u201cMost of the treatments that have been effective involve revisiting the trauma in a therapeutic setting, but a lot of people are unwilling or unable because they get overwhelmed by anxiety. MDMA decreases fear and defensiveness, while increasing trust and empathy.\u201d He worked with Doblin to develop a plan for a clinical study, approved by the FDA in 2001.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df58137450757890b8b6478538e78bb0cfb720d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df58137450757890b8b6478538e78bb0cfb720d6/0_159_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer and his wife Annie, a nurse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer and his wife Annie, a nurse, have been researching MDMA-assisted therapy for a decade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hunter McRae</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far, all the Maps trials have used doses of MDMA from a 31-year-old batch with 99.8% purity made in a lab at Purdue University, Indiana. But for phase three trials, the drug needs something called <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-manufacturing-practice-and-good-distribution-practice\">good manufacturing practice</a> certification: Maps has to be able to show that, if MDMA were legalised, it could be produced on an industrial level at the same quality. This is where <a href=\"http://www.shasun.com\">the pharmaceutical company Shasun</a> comes in.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Shasun\u2019s factory is in the Northumberland village of Dudley, located a few miles south of Cramlington, a small town with the highest life expectancy in the UK. It is not a secret facility: taxi drivers know the plant without being given the address, which is on a main road opposite a row of red-brick semis and shops. But they may be surprised to learn that, inside, chemists are synthesising MDMA, perfectly legally.</p> <p>Security is high. Visitors must first report to the lodge inside the gates and in front of the red-and-white barrier, the kind more often seen at military bases. Mobile phones must be surrendered, along with laptops, pagers, cameras and electronic car key fobs. The confiscation has less to do with secrecy than with the fact that the equipment could ignite and cause an explosion \u2013 a huge safety risk on a site processing volatile chemicals.</p> <p>Shasun has been given a licence from the Home Office to manufacture Schedule 1 substances. About 20 of the company\u2019s 325 UK staff are involved in the production of 1kg of MDMA \u2013 worth close to \u00a3300,000 ($398,000). After that, it will be shipped to licensed distributors<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>in the US and Europe.</p> <p>British CEO Kevin Cook met Doblin two years ago in Boston, after being introduced by someone Cook describes as \u201ca friend in big pharma\u201d. He came away from the meeting reassured that Doblin knew what he was doing, and was doing it for a good cause; Shasun was prepared to jump through all the regulatory hoops to keep everyone on board.</p> <p>Getting the Home Office licence was not easy. The firm has had to comply with a very long list of health and safety regulations, and security procedures. The drugs they make, and their key ingredients, are now stored in an alarmed vault to which just a handful of staff have access, their movements monitored by CCTV. \u201cWe can handle products here where there is a high risk of diversion \u2013 products that can be used for recreational as well as medical benefit,\u201d says Cook, who has worked for Shasun for 27 years. Shasun\u2019s business development manager, Mike Hopkins, jumps in to stress: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\">Breaking Bad</a> here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"345a2845d4d30e04cc54e5f13ece2bc0ab2c0c8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/345a2845d4d30e04cc54e5f13ece2bc0ab2c0c8d/0_90_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Cook, CEO of the British company manufacturing MDMA for medical use\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Cook, CEO of the British company manufacturing MDMA for medical use. \u2018We\u2019re not Breaking Bad here.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The MDMA lab is in Shasun\u2019s development centre, a prefab in a corner of the site. A rabbit hops around on the grass outside. \u201cOh, he\u2019s fine, don\u2019t mind him,\u201d Cook says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any chemicals out here he needs to worry about.\u201d To access the building, visitors must wear white lab coats and protective goggles. Making the MDMA is much like following a recipe \u2013 one that was acquired from a German firm and emailed to Shasun\u2019s chemists as an attachment. \u201cAdd X of this, stir to Y, heat to Z. It\u2019s like cooking, but to get a really good-quality end product, you have to experiment a lot,\u201d Cook explains. Robert Smith, a chemist with a degree from Cambridge and a PhD from Manchester, demonstrates the equipment his small team uses to synthesise the drug. Unlicensed manufacturers would face many years in jail, but making MDMA does not give Smith any kind of illicit thrill. \u201cWe just treat it like any other project.\u201d He shrugs.</p> <p>Recruiting a team was not difficult, Hopkins says; no one cited ethical concerns. \u201cWe always try to inspire our teams to understand what they are making and why. In this case, they are working for a non-profit trying to help people with severe PTSD. They find that sort of thing very motivating.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>After fundraising, Maps\u2019 second biggest challenge is training therapists, who must undergo the same treatment as their patients, to understand how it works. In November last year, Ben Sessa, a British psychiatrist based in Bristol, travelled to South Carolina for a 10-day stay with the Mithoefers, during which he underwent his own MDMA-assisted therapy session. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any psychological trauma,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a lovely upbringing, stable family. But it\u2019s really important to learn this mental state in order to guide my patients through it.\u201d</p> <p>On the day of his session, all of it captured on video, Sessa takes his first dose of MDMA just before 11am, washed down with a swig of Gatorade. It\u2019s a double blind study, so he doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a placebo. He hopes it isn\u2019t. (\u201cI chose the red pill and not the blue pill,\u201d he says, referencing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE7PKRjrid4\">The Matrix</a>.) Dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, Sessa reclines on a bed with Michael in a chair facing him, to his right, and Annie to his left. Propped into a seated position by a fortress of pillows and a large red and gold cushion, he has a blood pressure monitor wrapped around his left arm while the Mithoefers\u2019 small white dog, Flynn, snuggles next to his leg.</p> <p>The conversation is led by Sessa, with occasional prompts from the Mithoefers. Music plays in the background, starting with a gentle piano piece and building to higher tempo as the drug kicks in. The Mithoefers tell him to lie back, close his eyes and \u201cgo inside\u201d. Annie regularly checks in on him, offering sips of juice, extra blankets and words of encouragement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not a panacea. We need a cautious, methodological approach with sound scientific evidence</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Sessa, psychiatrist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Around two hours into the session, Sessa takes a supplementary dose. Even though he\u2019s in a darkened room, he asks for his red-rimmed sunglasses. \u201cThat second dose really hit the spot, man,\u201d he tells the Mithoefers. He breathes heavily and purposefully, nodding his head to the music with his eyes closed, his lower jaw shifting subtly from left to right. Clearly, he did not take the placebo.</p> <p>Sessa had taken MDMA in a rave context in the past but tells me: \u201cThis was very different from taking ecstasy recreationally. Imagine taking all that external energy that keeps you pumping all night on the dance floor and turning it inwards.\u201d</p> <p>Much of his session is spent lying down with an eye mask and headphones on; at times he hums and moans or reaches out to hold one of the Mithoefers\u2019 hands. \u201cI felt very safe and secure, but when I went to the toilet in the harsh light and stood looking at myself in the mirror, that\u2019s when it felt like raving. I was completely fucked. I wanted to rush back into the bed and get under the covers and go back inside.\u201d</p> <p>At other times, he is encouraged to sit up and talk \u2013 about personal issues, psychotherapy, his constant need to be busy. \u201cLife\u2019s too short,\u201d he tells the Mithoefers. \u201cAll these trinkets we adorn ourselves with are meaningless. It\u2019s time that\u2019s the only gift. So I don\u2019t like to waste time.\u201d</p> <p>By around 4pm, the effects of the drug are wearing off, though Sessa says he experienced no comedown. He thinks ravers\u2019 comedowns are mostly hangovers. \u201cMost people who take ecstasy will go to the pub, drink three pints, then go to a club and stay up until five, take coke, drink more wine and beer, then get some soup and sleep on Sunday. Of course they feel bad on Monday!\u201d</p> <p>Three days later, Sessa had a second session. It was the same setup, but this time without the drug. \u201cIt was incredibly cathartic,\u201d he says. \u201cI was in floods of tears at times and talking about all sorts of issues. It was as if the MDMA had unlocked them three days earlier. It\u2019s not just the drug sessions themselves where the work takes place \u2013 the real work is how the material that\u2019s unlocked is then processed in the non-drug sessions.\u201d</p> <p>Sessa, who has worked with many children and adolescents battling trauma and addictions, believes MDMA could be an incredibly powerful tool for his patients. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any medicines that allow patients and their therapists to approach trauma. Antidepressants only treat the symptoms, so this could be a very important step forward.\u201d</p> <p>Trauma is incredibly hard to treat, he says. \u201cYou sit in a room with a stranger and ask them to tell you about their child abuse and expect them to do it. They don\u2019t. They can\u2019t. So their mental health problem becomes a chronic disorder.

This is not a panacea. We need a cautious, methodological approach with sound scientific evidence.\u201d</p> <p>Sessa has brought what he\u2019s learned back to the UK, where he is hoping to start two Maps-funded MDMA studies in 2017; for now, he says, he\u2019s in a \u201cfragile period of getting ethical approval\u201d.</p> <p>One of these studies is in Cardiff and will involve giving patients either MDMA or a placebo and putting them in an MRI scanner, where they will be subjected to a narrative script of their trauma to see what happens in their brain. The second study, in Bristol, will treat patients with alcohol dependency, post-detox. \u201cWe\u2019ll put them through a course of MDMA psychotherapy and look at the rates of recovery. The link between trauma and addiction is unambiguous,\u201d Sessa says.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>In anticipation of the drug\u2019s legalisation, Maps has set up a benefit corporation, a socially responsible company that, unlike Maps, is allowed to manage prescription sales of a medicine. All profits from the MDMA developed by Shasun will be funnelled back into Maps\u2019 research. The patent for MDMA has long expired but, thanks to a law signed by Ronald Reagan in 1984, no other pharmaceutical company would be able to use Maps\u2019 research data for five years after the drug is approved.</p> <p>Big pharma probably wouldn\u2019t be interested anyway, Doblin says, because the therapy involves so few doses of MDMA. \u201cMost pharmaceutical companies want to make a drug people take on a daily basis, that treats symptoms, not the problem, so when you stop taking it, the problem comes back. It\u2019s a money-making formula. We are the opposite of that: you take the drug a few times, hopefully it cures you and you go on your way.\u201d</p> <p>For Alice and CJ, legalisation can\u2019t come soon enough. Alice says the biggest change since treatment has been her relationship with her husband and two young children. \u201cIt allowed me to connect \u2013 I could step into now, instead of living back then.\u201d For the first time, she was able to hug her husband, whom she married 11 years ago, when she was 21, and to undress in front of him. \u201cI could hold on to my children\u2019s hands and snuggle them without feeling gross.\u201d She is now working as an optician and training to become a psychotherapist herself.</p> <p>For CJ, the treatment led to a \u201c100% turnaround\u201d in his life. Like Alice, he no longer has therapy or takes medication for his mental health. He has given up drinking and found a job with an aviation company. He married his long-term girlfriend at the end of August. He still thinks about his time in the army, but now remembers the good things, the people he bonded with. He wishes other people could experience the benefits: \u201cIt feels as though there\u2019s a cure for cancer that I know of \u2013 and it\u2019s not being used.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Alice is a pseudonym.

  "<p>It came about by accident, one day. It was a Sunday afternoon and I\u2019d planned on doing a roast chicken and roasting some butternut squash too \u2013 a quintessentially Australian thing from my childhood. Everything was ready to put in the oven, but when I went to do so, it stopped working. So I browned the chicken with onions in a cast iron pot, then threw in the squash with some sage and tomatoes from the garden, and let it roast on the stove top. I finished it off with some creme fraiche. My kids couldn\u2019t get over how good it was. \u201cOh my god, Mom, this is the best thing you\u2019ve ever cooked,\u201d they said. And they still really love it.</p> <p>They\u2019re both living in the US at the moment \u2013 Evie in New York and Holly in LA \u2013 and this is the dish they want whenever they\u2019re home. I have dishes like this I always ask my Mom to cook when I go back to Australia \u2013 they\u2019re so comforting; they make you feel warm inside. And I know my girls feel the same with this dish. I am <em>so</em> looking forward to Christmas, when they\u2019ll both be home at the same time.</p> <p>One thing I feel really proud of is seeing my daughters both so completely at ease in the kitchen. They take pleasure in food; they\u2019re interested in it. A friend recently gave me a very old book from the 1920s or 1930s about dessert \u2013 no recipes, just paragraphs \u2013 from a time when women really did cook all the time. Nowadays, people often don\u2019t seem to have confidence. Throughout my life, I\u2019ve met so many women who have a really complicated relationship with the kitchen, who feel like they can\u2019t cook. So, seeing my kids being so relaxed in the kitchen feels good.</p> <p>The other day, Holly called me to talk about a dinner she was planning as a welcome-back present for her boyfriend. Their friends often come over and they all end up cooking together. They\u2019re 18-19, and very health-conscious; they love <a href=\"http://deliciouslyella.com/\">Deliciously Ella</a>. And I think it\u2019s so lovely that they\u2019re interested. It\u2019s like how Jamie Oliver got his generation cooking.</p> <p>Most days I eat at the restaurant, but when I\u2019m home alone, I just have toast and a boiled egg. But I do find that cooking at home for people gives me pleasure. A lot of my friends live really close and we often cook together. People often ask me: \u201cHow do I cook a restaurant meal at home?\u201d I always think: \u201cWhy the hell would you want to?\u201d Cooking simply with family and friends is so much more convivial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c75938bd04faa42a681887c059da485d04da4916\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c75938bd04faa42a681887c059da485d04da4916/0_85_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pot-roasted chicken with butternut squash and sage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My daughters, Evie and Holly, are both living in the US at the moment,\u2019 says Gyngell. \u2018This is the dish they want whenever they\u2019re home.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Pot-roasted chicken with butternut squash and sage</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br>1 lemon, halved<br>2 fresh bay leaves (dried is fine too)<br>A small bunch of fresh sage<br>1 whole chicken, cavity rinsed out with water, drained and excess fat around neck trimmed off.<br>2 tbsp olive oil<br>1 red onion, peeled and cut into chunks<br>5 garlic cloves, peeled but left whole<br>1.2kg butternut squash, peeled and cut into large chunks<br>1 large parsnip, peeled and cut into large chunks<br>2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes<br>2 tbsp creme fraiche</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Put half the lemon, 1 bay leaf and half the bunch of sage inside the cavity of the chicken.

  "<p>The first duty of a Roman Catholic cardinal, when elected pope, is to choose the name by which he wants to be known. Among the 266 holders of the papacy to date, the current incumbent is the first to take Francis, a flash of re-baptismal originality in a line of succession in which the Johns reach 23, there have been a dozen men called Pius and 13 took the name Innocent.</p> <p>This autumn, though, Pope Francis will co-exist with Pope Innocent XIV, the title eventually taken by the winner among the cardinals competing for the throne of St Peter in Robert Harris\u2019s thriller, <em>Conclave</em>, and Pius XIII, the identity selected by Jude Law as the first American pontiff in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/03/the-young-pope-review-jude-laws-sleek-pontiff-shines-in-sorrentinos-twin-peaks\"><em>The Young Pope</em></a>, a TV drama that starts its UK run on Sky Atlantic next month.</p> <p>In fiction, there has already been an Innocent XIV, in <em>The Fourth K</em>, a 1990 novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/mario-puzo\">Mario Puzo</a>, and a previous Pius XIII, in <em>The Shoes of the Fisherman</em>, the 1963 novel by Morris West that can be seen as the rock on which all modern pontifical fictions are based, although the genre of fake papacies has a long tradition: Christopher Marlowe gives the real Pope Adrian IV a schismatic rival, Pope Bruno, in his late 16th century tragedy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/marlowe\"><em>Doctor Faustus</em></a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba92f60b6c1d7af53407689cb8e5409020d9d61d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba92f60b6c1d7af53407689cb8e5409020d9d61d/306_420_4769_2861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Ryan Doctor Faustus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Ryan as Mephistophilis in the RSC\u2019s <em>Doctor Faustus.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Maybanks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marlowe\u2019s warring Catholic leaders were intended to amuse audiences in Protestant England, and it is suspicion of the papacy \u2013 as foreign, strange, potentially treacherous \u2013 that has made it such a profitable subject for fiction. One of the oddest and most enduring Vatican novels was written directly as revenge on the church. Rejected as a candidate for the priesthood, the English author Frederick Rolfe wrote, under the pseudonym \u201cBaron Corvo\u201d, a novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/02/100-best-novels-hadrian-seventh-frederick-rolfe\"><em>Hadrian the Seventh </em></a>(1904), in which a failed priest is later made pope by a repentant Vatican. In 1967, it was adapted by Peter Luke into a successful play, with Alec McCowen as the surprise leader of the faithful.</p> <p>Whereas Marlowe and Rolfe were personally motivated to take on the pope, most writers in the genre are attracted by the external drama. Head of the only church that is also a nation state, the pope fascinates because of a doubly unusual lifestyle. He is denied sex, one of the most powerful human desires. Harris\u2019s <em>Conclave</em> and West\u2019s <em>The Clowns of God</em> (1980) both turn, as did <em>Holy Father</em>, a play I wrote for BBC Radio 4 last year, on ways in which the ecclesiastical rules of sexuality might be tested without sin. However, those priests who become cardinals are tantalised by the prospect of another Darwinian driving motivation \u2013 power \u2013 at a level perhaps only matched by the American presidency.</p> <p>As a result, ecclesiastical politics clearly have a resonance beyond religion. Vatican fictions tend to have the same main plotline: a contest between reforming and orthodox candidates. This reflects the narrative of most actual papal elections \u2013 these stories tend to be a serious exploration of what is supposed to be a famously apocryphal question: is the pope a Catholic? \u2013 but such testing for heresy is also common in political parties, such as, at the moment, Labour in the UK and the Republicans in the US.</p> <p>It feels logical that Harris should have turned to the papacy after having written thrillers about a Blairite prime minister in <em>The Ghost</em> and the politics of ancient Rome in his Cicero trilogy. The incense-filled rooms of a conclave (the name by which the heavily sequestered papal election assembly is known) have an obvious parallel with the smoke-filled rooms of the traditional political procedural. And, as in presidential and prime ministerial fictions, a key decision for papal narratives is whether the made-up characters should be seen in succession to real-life figures.</p> <p>In an author\u2019s note to <em>Conclave</em>, Harris insists that the man whose death kicks off his plot \u201cis not the current pope\u201d. This disclaimer is probably necessary because the late pontiff is revealed to have made some eccentric decisions but, as Harris\u2019s \u201clate Holy Father\u201d shares most of the biography of Pope Francis and has also made identical speeches, it is in practice impossible not to impose his face on the character. Even more baldly, Piers Paul Read\u2019s thriller <em>The Death of a Pope</em> (2009) superimposes the crisis of a fictional priest on a documentary account of the death of John Paul II and the election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as Benedict XVI.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07326109007b6daebbc3e63a7ec84c86802834f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07326109007b6daebbc3e63a7ec84c86802834f2/2112_111_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Harris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Harris\u2019s forthcoming book, <em>Conclave,</em> focuses on the election of a new pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Contrastingly, Morris West, the Australian novelist who is commonly considered the pope of the Vatican thriller, created an elaborate alternative progression. Pope Kiril I in <em>The Shoes of the Fisherman</em> is succeeded by Gregory XVII in <em>The Clowns of God</em>, who gives way to Leo XIV in <em>Lazarus</em> (1990).</p> <p>West\u2019s novels have an astonishing record of prophecy. <em>The Shoes of the Fisherman</em> was published on the day that John XXIII died, and imagined an eastern European anti-Soviet cardinal ending the long line of Italian popes, which duly happened in 1978, when Cardinal Wotyla of Krak\u00f3w became John Paul II. The unlikely plot of <em>The Clowns of God</em> (1981), in which a pope resigns because he can no longer face the burdens of office, was validated in February 2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/11/pope-benedict-xvi-resigns-age\">the retirement of Benedict XVI</a>. In West\u2019s final conclave novel, <em>Eminence</em> (1998), the leading candidate to become pope, a Latin American radical called Cardinal Luca Rossini, now reads as a spooky preview of the Argentinian Jorge Mario Bergoglio becoming Pope Francis.</p> <p>Whether or not Bergoglio knew it, fiction had got to his papal name before he did: a cardinal takes it at the end of the conclave imagined in <em>The Vicar of Christ</em> (1979) by the American writer, Walter F Murphy. Most novelists, though, extend one of the existing nominal lists, with some more popular than others.</p> <p>The year before West annointed a Gregory XVII, another one had appeared in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthonyburgess\">Anthony Burgess</a>\u2019s <em>Earthly Powers</em> (1980). The book\u2019s gay, atheist narrator, Kenneth Toomey, is the brother in law of Carlo Campanati, an Italian cleric who rose to become Gregory XVII, and has become a candidate for sainthood after a miracle that Toomey witnessed.</p> <p>In Burgess\u2019s alternative version of the 20th century, Cardinal Campanati takes the post-1958 papacy occupied in reality by John XXIII. There has in fact been no 24th John \u2013 as the former Cardinal Roncalli of Venice was identified as the most reforming pope of modern times, direct identification by a successor would have risked a schism in the Vatican \u2013 although two have appeared in very contrasting works of fantasy fiction.</p> <p>In Kingsley Amis\u2019s <em>The Alteration</em> (1976), the Reformation has not happened and England remains a Roman Catholic country, obedient to the religious rule from Rome of a Yorkshire-born pontiff, who seems to be a caricature of Harold Wilson, British prime minister at the time Amis was writing. The John XXIV of the <a href=\"http://leftbehind.com/\">Left Behind</a> series \u2013 16 books by the Christian evangelists Tim LaHaye and Jerry B Jenkins \u2013 was also contentiously presented. Having become too close to Protestantism, he is taken by God and replaced by the more orthodox Peter II, a designation that no real occupant of the post has ever been arrogant enough to adopt.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\">Graham Greene</a>\u2019s late short story, \u201cThe Last Word\u201d, published in 1988, the line of Johns reaches XXIX, although also stops there, with the last pontiff having become a prisoner of an anti-Christian government. As Greene\u2019s new world order in some way resembles the global caliphate envisaged by Islamic State, a notable political novelist had once again spotted a future trend. West, Dan Brown, Read and now Harris all have plot lines that turn on a perceived Islamist terrorist threat to the office of the papacy.</p> <p>One reason that the role has attracted so many thriller writers is that it is attended by many persistent conspiracy theories. The so-called \u201cSiri thesis\u201d alleges that Cardinal Giuseppe Siri of Genoa was elected pope in 1958, but that, as a conservative, his accession was blocked by liberals who replaced him with John XXIII.</p> <p>Hardcore conspiracists, known as sedevacantists (roughly translating as empty throners) have refused to recognise any of the last six popes, whom they regard as invalid. The fact that Siri himself always denied the claims was explained away, as these things often are, by his being in fear of his life. A more benign version of the thesis \u2013 that Siri might have changed his own mind \u2013 can be glimpsed, in comedic form, behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/19/nanni-moretti-pope-film-habemus-papam\"><em>Habemus Papam</em></a><em> </em>(<em>We Have a Pope </em>in the UK), the 2011 film by Nanni Moretti, in which a pontiff goes on the run post-election to avoid taking up office.</p> <p>Better known matters of Vatican contention are the allegation that John Paul I, who died suddenly after only 33 days in office in 1978, was murdered; repeated scandals involving the Vatican Bank, which has been accused of corruption including money laundering; and the belief that a secret document in a Vatican safe (known as \u201cThe Third Secret of F\u00e1tima\u201d), supposedly revealed by a vision of the Virgin Mary to Portuguese children in 1917, contains an apocalyptic secret such as the date of the end of the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"113055e281f8c7195f004d65785ef2231f811cd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/113055e281f8c7195f004d65785ef2231f811cd6/0_0_2696_1617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angels Demons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willing to kill \u2026 Armin Mueller-Stahl and Ewan McGregor in the 2009 film of Dan Brown\u2019s <em>Angels &amp; Demons</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although John Paul II released the text of the \u201cthird secret\u201d \u2013 which turned out to be a sub-Nostradamus allegory that can be made to represent either the destruction or triumph of Catholicism \u2013 true disbelievers continue to insist that the Vatican publication was a fake in place of a true prophecy considered too terrifying to publicise.</p> <p>Shadows from these various controversies can be spotted in most pontifical fiction. The F\u00e1tima-related belief that Catholicism is withholding terrible information underlies Brown\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/15/angels-and-demons\"><em>Angels and Demons</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/the-da-vinci-code\"><em>The Da Vinci Code</em></a>, both of which have popes willing to kill to hide the true story of Christianity. Suspicions about the death of John Paul I mean that deaths and elections of fictional pontiffs are almost always suspicious. Even Burgess, though not operating in the mystery genre, contrives a sudden death during the conclave described in <em>Earthly Powers</em>. These presentations of the devious ease with which the Vatican dissembles also clearly serve as a metaphor for the Catholic church\u2019s unwillingness to address the scandals of priestly paedophilia.</p> <p>Despite papal fiction being such a crowded church, Harris, in <em>Conclave</em>, contrives a twist involving the number of cardinal-electors that seems to me completely new, showing that the genre still has possibilities. Some people claim that the Third Secret of F\u00e1tima warns that the current pope is the last but, if so, the line should continue in fiction.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/conclave.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Conclave</a></em> is published on 22 September; <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-young-pope\">The Young Pope</a></em> starts on Sky Atlantic on 27 October; <em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/theatre/event-detail.asp?id=19605\">Doctor Faustus</a></em> is at the Barbican, London EC2, until 1 October.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 September 2016.

Turnbull really threw his all into the role of \u201cAustralia\u2019s most inept prime minister\u201d by trying his best to match Abbott\u2019s Newspoll net satisfaction ratings. He also wasted a lot of political capital by introducing legislation to run Abbott\u2019s plebiscite on same-sex marriage \u2013 the very process that Turnbull had decried just 13 months ago. </p> <p>The part of Turnbull was played by Bill Shorten. Not only did Shorten announce Coalition government policy but he also took a Dixer in question time and junked the last two days of parliament so he could meet the Canadian prime minister. </p> <p>(By the way, I think I speak for a large portion of Australia \u2013 men and women alike \u2013 when I say I understand Shorten\u2019s decision. Given a choice of looking across the chamber at the Coalition frontbench, or across the table at Justin Trudeau, I know where I\u2019d rather be.)</p> <p>The part of the responsible and grown-up treasurer of Australia was played by Scott Morrison. He negotiated in good faith with the opposition to pass the omnibus savings legislation. He also resolved the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/superannuation-backflip-on-500000-cap-wins-over-coalition-conservatives\">superannuation debate</a> that had been paralysing his government. I don\u2019t know where the Coalition found this guy, but he\u2019s a vast improvement on their usual treasurer. </p> <p>And the part of Shorten was played by Tanya Plibersek. In Shorten\u2019s absence she led the opposition in question time in what I judged to be an admirable effort. </p> <p>For a brief moment it looked like Peter Dutton would be playing the part of the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz (you know, he\u2019d discover that he really did have a heart all along). An ambiguous interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/peter-dutton-open-to-refugees-on-nauru-being-resettled-in-new-zealand\">Dutton gave on al-Jazeera</a> led to speculation on Thursday afternoon that the Australian government was about to announce that refugees on Manus Island and Nauru could go to New Zealand. For the first time ever, news editors across the nation said: \u201cWe really must listen to Peter Dutton\u2019s speech at 5pm today.\u201d </p> <p>Turned out Peter seems to still be travelling on the yellow brick road, most likely lost somewhere in the haunted forest. At least he, unlike the asylum seekers, has a hope of getting to Oz one day. </p> <p>Finally, Pauline Hanson played the part of that person who says: \u201cSome of my best friends are Aboriginal.\u201d</p> <p>Sure, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\">can still divide a nation</a> with her rhetoric (this time about Muslims) and fact-free analysis (this time about China). But 20 years after excoriating Indigenous Australians for their freeloading-off-the-taxpayer lifestyles, Hanson didn\u2019t mention Indigenous people once in her inaugural speech. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/16/stranger-things-in-parliament-this-week-with-varying-doses-of-reality\">Stranger Things in parliament this week, with varying doses of reality | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hanson went even farther and embraced \u2013 literally hugged \u2013 Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, a Yanyuwa woman who spoke in her inaugural speech unflinchingly about the disadvantages Aboriginal people face and the need for constitutional recognition. </p> <p>Who\u2019s to say that in 20 years time Hanson won\u2019t be hugging Senator Jihad Dib as she carries on attacking the menace of west Africans or whichever wave of new migrants next rolls her into parliament.</p> <p>Maybe Bewitched got it right: you can change the cast, but the characters stay the same.</p> <p>PS: If I\u2019m right about the Seinfeldian theory, I sincerely hope Turnbull hasn\u2019t seen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi68hPMinAI\">The Contest</a>.

  "<p>One of the premises of How to Be a Person in the World is that we\u2019re all in this big, stinking mess together. If you are alive, you probably, at some point in your life, felt a wreck, aimless, suffered an important loss, thought yourself an impostor, or worried that others have more friends, more fun, more of their shit together \u2013 or all of the above. You might be an overthinker. Indeed, if you\u2019ve ever wondered what the hell is the point of anything in this crumbling world, you might find solace in Heather Havrilesky\u2019s book.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/ask-polly-advice-column-heather-havrilesky\">Ask Polly's Heather Havrilesky: 'I feel connected to the people who write to me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How to Be a Person in the World is made up of a selection of letters, some from Havrilesky\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/tags/ask-polly/\">Ask Polly</a> column, which she currently writes for New York Magazine\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/\">The Cut</a> (and previously for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theawl.com/\">the Awl</a>). Ask Polly tackles readers\u2019 questions on anxieties about the modern world and its technologies but also issues ranging from grief to sexual assault. Its key message being: the way you\u2019re feeling is OK.</p> <p>This caught me by surprise. I hadn\u2019t ever paid much attention to advice columns, other than flirting with Cheryl Strayed\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://therumpus.net/sections/blogs/dear-sugar/\">Dear Sugar</a> articles in the Rumpus \u2013 but somehow the prescriptive tone, even if offered without judgment and and being funny and clever, never seemed<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>quite right. It would be inspiring for a bit, and then it would always get supremely annoying.</p> <p>And then I discovered Heather Havrilesky. She is not only an excellent writer and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/amy-cuddys-presence-and-shonda-rhimess-year-of-yes.html\">cultural critic</a>, but the best possible agony aunt for people who don\u2019t care for agony aunts. She combines a fierce optimism about humans and their ability to take control of their own lives with a messiness and hilarious grumpiness that does feel like you\u2019re talking to a great, moody, mildly aggressive friend. And she has an exceptional ability to hit the nail on the head and fundamentally understand people, regardless of whether she\u2019s tackling commitment issues, friendship conflicts, creative block or how to live with an STD. She gets it. </p> <p>Here is the thunderous end of her answer to a 25-year-old who is lost in a sea of self-doubt and demotivation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Life is not about knowing. Life is about feeling your way through the dark. If you say, \u2018This should be lighter by now,\u2019 you\u2019re shutting yourself off from your own happiness. So let there be darkness. Get down on your knees, and crawl to the dark. Crawl and say to yourself, \u2018Holy GOD, it\u2019s dark, but just look at me crawl! I can crawl like a <em>motherfucker</em>.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>Havrilesky is not always that intense \u2013 she can be ridiculously funny as well. The way she puts down a man who is convinced that having an affair is the right thing to do for his marriage (he\u2019s put together a list of supporting evidence!) is worth the cover price alone. Her use of pop culture references to add to her points can also be hilarious \u2013 see her fantastic <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theawl.com/ask-polly-how-do-i-find-true-love-and-stop-dating-half-assed-men-aab05734e83c#.2n7rgrqii\">stretching of a Kanye West metaphor</a> \u201cbeyond the breaking point\u201d or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/05/ask-polly-why-do-i-always-want-unavailable-men.html\">this piece</a> using the Hemsworth brothers as the embodiment of unavailable men fantasies.</p> <p>My favourite thing about Ask Polly is that it is fantastic proof of how the internet can bring people together in an honest, true way.<strong> </strong>Havrilesky has been writing advice on the internet since the early dotcom days. In paper form, the writing is addictive. Even if the format is perfect for bite-sized reading, I \u2013 and everyone I know who has read it \u2013 devoured pretty much in one go. </p> <p>So, if you ever feel like everyone else has it all figured out, pick up this book. Hell, do it even if you\u2019re entirely together and well-adjusted. It might surprise you.</p> <p>As the writer herself said in a recent interview with the <a href=\"http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/episode-39-ask-polly/\">Call Your Girlfriend podcast</a>, she doesn\u2019t see herself as someone especially qualified to be in the business \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/books/review/heather-havrilesky-ask-polly-how-to-be-a-person-in-the-world.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=1\">burgeoning literary genre</a> \u2013 of delivering epiphanies to people with life crises. She has had her share of bad times. But Ask Polly stands out against other self-help writing because, as Havrilesky herself says: \u201cI\u2019m very against seeming like I know special things.\u201d Her aim, as opposed to the big-problem approach of Strayed\u2019s or Oprah\u2019s heavenly touch, is more to \u201clead by bad example. I\u2019m at the halfway point \u2013 you want to get up to where I am and hopefully surpass me.\u201d</p>",

Pulses and beans etc are a really inexpensive way to get protein. Nuts and seeds on the other hand can be quite pricey. Remember that the world's poorest people are on the whole pretty close to being vegan most of the time. However, there is also a cultural veganism that can look and sound elitist. That is a perception vegans should counter, in the hope of making this choice more widely acceptable.</p> <p>On the issue of soya, paradoxically, if you want to eat less of it, you should eat soya. The reason is that the great majority of soya is fed to livestock, in order to produce milk, eggs and meat. And that production process is highly inefficient by comparison to eating it yourself. If you eat it directly, you can choose soya products that are grown without rainforest destruction and other such impacts.

Britain was just coming out of empire. But I\u2019m also able to live the life that I live now.\u201d It has by any lights been fulfilling: a military career, leadership of the Lib Dems, on to the House of Lords, smattered with the memoirs and books that he writes, he says, \u201cin the corners of my life, on trains, waiting for planes\u201d.</p> <p>His latest, Game of Spies, is the true story of a fascinating wartime triad: a spy, a traitor and a disarmingly human member of the Gestapo. It is an insistent and sometimes mesmerising read, tugging at your attention when you put it down, based on an extraordinary cache of documents sent to him by a reader of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/23/paddy-ashdown-spoils-afternoon-prime-minister\">a previous book of his, A Brilliant Little Operation</a>. However, despite this proposed subject matter, most exchanges either begin or end \u2013 or both \u2013 with Brexit, an event about which he felt, \u201clike everybody else, bereft; a sense of personal bereavement. I knew this was coming, a month before. You entertain hopes at the last moment, it\u2019s always a shock. But we drove back to London over Salisbury Plain, it was one of those lovely June mornings.

So return his thoughts, to the fact that he is \u201cvery, very, very frightened about where we are.

He still sounds incredibly military, and says that it informs his writing. \u201cHave I been involved in the business of intelligence, one way or another? Yes. Have I been in the special forces? Yes. Have I been in politics? Yes. That gives you certain insights, much as a woman\u201d \u2013 a look of discomfort crosses his face, which I must admit I enjoy \u2013 \u201cbecause she\u2019s a woman, could write a piece, and know what a woman\u2019s view of these events would be. I don\u2019t say men can\u2019t do it, but you\u2019re better equipped.\u201d Cheers, dude.</p> <p>However, he insists that the military is the least interesting thing about his past. \u201cIt\u2019s the bit where people love to pigeonhole me \u2013 \u2018He was in the Royal Marines and the special services.\u2019 Let me ask you this one question: did you know that I\u2019m the only member of parliament elected from the unemployed register?

Five years later, he was leader of the Lib Dems. He is not without pride, but he\u2019s generally proud about the right things.</p> <p>That said, he has a bit of a blindspot about the Lib Dems, against whom he will not hear a word. Nick Clegg is \u201ca vastly underappreciated figure in British politics\u201d, he says, although doesn\u2019t deny calling him <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/nick-clegg-did-not-cater-tories-brazen-ruthlessness\">\u201cfat, pale and unhealthy\u201d, as Clegg recalled in his recent memoirs</a>. \u201cYeah, absolutely. He was the person at the front of the campaign. We get on very well together, I like him very much, but I wasn\u2019t about to not tell him something that I felt he ought to know.\u201d He thinks the Lib Dem \u201cresurgence is happening, take a look at the byelection results\u201d and that the party will, long-term, see a \u201cdividend\u201d from having been in the coalition: \u201cWe will have a reputation for being able to bear the burdens of government, I never expected that in the short run.\u201d And finally \u2013 this is the bit that makes me boggle: \u201cI think history will judge it [2010 to 2015] one of the best periods of government we\u2019ve had in my lifetime, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see another as good for some considerable time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7efab327649947c3e762bd53fe748704deffe178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7efab327649947c3e762bd53fe748704deffe178/0_0_4256_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Charles Kennedy, centre, and Nick Clegg in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Charles Kennedy, centre, and Nick Clegg in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seriously? \u201cI think it did a number of things that were really important.\u201d Like what? \u201cFirst of all, it restrained the Tories; secondly, it helped the country through a very, very difficult passage by providing a majority government who took some sensible decisions.\u201d Like what? \u201cThirdly, it was serious about its environmental targets. Most people say that the green deal did a huge amount. Speak to environmentalists.\u201d (I did so at the time, as luck would have it: the deal started off with some ambition, but ended up as a programme of market-driven loans \u2013 at 7%, not even that cheap \u2013 for people to insulate their homes.

I don\u2019t want to bore on, but in the interests of a pre-post-truth politics, I feel bound to point out that this was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/18/green-deal-green-disaster\">one of the limpest, most pathetic policies in the history of government.</a>)</p> <p>\u201cFourthly, did we do everything to close the gap between the rich and the poor? No, but we did some very important things, such as the pupil premium. It was good, sensible, solid government. It didn\u2019t do all the things I would have wanted, but I\u2019m very clear that it was the right thing to do for the country.\u201d His loyalty to the party is absolutely unswerving, but he will, finally, admit: \u201cDo I want to see them recover? Yes. Will I help them recover? Yes. Do I see signs of recovery? Yes. But that isn\u2019t going to be in time to help the people I want to help.\u201d</p> <p>This is the thinking behind <a href=\"http://www.moreunited.uk\">More United, a joint venture with others broadly of his mind</a> such as Martha Lane Fox \u2013 which attempts to connect people to politics by some route other than a party. \u201cIt has 35,000 members in five weeks, which is not bad, half the size of the Lib Dems.\u201d It has five very broad principles \u2013 fair markets, rebooted democracy, a green economy, openness and tolerance, pro-immigration \u2013 and its members campaign, with money and by any other means they can think of, to give support to the candidate they think best embodies the ideas. It\u2019s neutral in a party political sense, anyone can join, has <a href=\"https://www.crowdpac.co.uk\">a lot in common with Steve Hilton\u2019s Crowdpac</a> and relies ultimately on open primaries, in which non-affiliated voters can choose a candidate.</p> <p>There are politicians who remain profoundly opposed to this idea, most of them in the Labour party, and whose furthest concession to a possible progressive alliance is that the Greens, the Lib Dems and Labour might cut some electoral deals between constituencies. \u201cBeen there, done that,\u201d says Ashdown. \u201cIt turns friends into enemies, it exhausts and uses up vast amounts of political capital. And by the way, politicians aren\u2019t even believed. If the centre-left says, \u2018Do this\u2019, the people will say, \u2018Fuck off\u2019.\u201d He thinks, and he\u2019s by no means alone in this, that political parties have come unshackled from the movements that gave them legitimacy and energy. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a public that doesn\u2019t feel represented by the political parties, they will react. So they either take over, Trump or Corbyn, a political party, move in and occupy it. Or they form their own political parties, Ukip is an example, Marine Le Pen, the Greens in a way.\u201d</p> <p>The question he\u2019s trying to answer now is: \u201cWhy do movements always have to be for horrible things?\u201d and, on the heels of that, how to organise those on the left \u2013 environmentalists, liberals, \u201csensible Labour\u201d, in his winning phrase. \u201cIn the past, if you wanted to get the left together you had to accept the single dominant polarity, which was Labour. Especially with Blair, it meant doing that kind of deal, top-down by the way. Now the left is so fractured, so broken, so diverse, so pluralist. How do you assemble the pieces to make an effective centre-left political force possible?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63f7f9a869cde095e07f4408baec5cda550f3481\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63f7f9a869cde095e07f4408baec5cda550f3481/0_0_3687_2489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"By the Bell suspension bridge in Glasgow in 1995.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">By the Bell suspension bridge in Glasgow in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although he had never entertained the idea of retiring, it seems as though he did think his days in the political fray were over.

I didn\u2019t expect to find myself doing anything interesting.\u201d His sadness over the result is tinged, like all great regrets, with self-criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s not generally known, but about four weeks before the referendum debate, I was so worried that we were going to lose, I went to see John Major, I went to see Gordon Brown, I went to see George Robertson. Major was really impressive and Gordon did his Gordon best, but that wasn\u2019t the issue. The strategy was wrong. I said: \u2018Listen, the only way that we\u2019re going to win this is if the heavyweights get together and tell them that they\u2019re going to lose. Each of us played our individual parts, but we didn\u2019t get together to turn the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>It is perhaps in this glimpse of his sense of failure that you recognise his great success. Disappointment cannot wither him \u2013 not his party\u2019s first bite of government turning sour, not its minuscule remains, not the end of British internationalism, not the slog of rebuilding tolerance and generosity as political ideals, not the fact that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/oct/21/uk.politicalnews\">his foes on social media still call him Paddy Pantsdown</a>.

  "<p>One morning when he was 12, Samuel Blaise decided to skip school with his best friend Cyril. Both boys hitched a ride across the French countryside, back to their small Normandy town. By noon, they were home unsupervised. \u201cLet\u2019s have a drink,\u201d Cyril suggested. \u201cWe can try the whiskey, the one my father likes.\u201d</p> <p>They had a nip, and then another. \u201cIt tasted horrible,\u201d Blaise recalls. \u201cBut something clicked. I suddenly felt relaxed and at peace. We polished it off and spent the afternoon lying down on the tiled floor. It felt like I was sleeping in cotton wool. I had discovered my drug.\u201d</p> <p>Soon Blaise started drinking on his own every night, raiding his parents\u2019 cabinet for potent liqueurs. To avoid being found out, he would mix a \u201ccoffin\u201d \u2013 a slug of every other bottle he could find mixed in a tall glass. He would sip it quietly while the rest of the family slept upstairs.</p> <p>Blaise, who is now 46 and an entrepreneur in Paris, says that for decades, only booze could ease his \u201cpathological anxiety\u201d. In his late 30s, at the height of his addiction, he would down between one and two liters of strong beer, followed by a bottle of wine and servings of vodka or whiskey. Sometimes he would wake up in the street or in hospital after a blackout.</p> <p>Finally, a doctor confronted him with enough force that Blaise believed him: he was a handful of years from death. Blaise tried AA, multiple medications, and three-week detox programs. Nothing worked. He and his partner \u2013 they have two children together \u2013 knew something drastic needed to be done. So on Christmas Day 2011, Blaise sat down at his computer and started typing, looking for help. </p> <p>Then, after scrolling through pages and pages, he found his holy grail: a medication called Baclofen.</p> <h2>The doctor who played guinea pig</h2> <p>Olivier Ameisen, a noted French cardiologist, also knew a thing or two about alcohol.</p> <p>Ameisen was, from the outside, a wildly successful man. He had a private practice in Manhattan, had been awarded the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur for his work and, to top it all, was a brilliant pianist. But the physician was also helplessly addicted to alcohol and regularly hospitalized after binges. Like Blaise, every single treatment had failed him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3059c4369b4e15f2840309fc5d272468ea8cd28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3059c4369b4e15f2840309fc5d272468ea8cd28/0_0_843_843/500.jpg\" alt=\"cans\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>His situation was desperate, but a thought kept nagging him. After reading a New York Times article describing how Baclofen eased the muscle spams of a cocaine addict, he developed a hunch that the drug \u2013 a relaxant typically used to treat patients with multiple sclerosis \u2013 might help him.</p> <p>With nothing left to lose, he decided to turn himself into a guinea pig, reasoning that it was \u201cmore dignified to die during my own clinical experiment than it was to die of alcoholism\u201d. In 2004, he started taking small, and then increasing doses of the drug. He was astonished when, a few weeks in, his cravings disappeared. He simply had no desire for a glass of wine any more.</p> <p>The Last Glass, the account of his miraculous recovery, came out 2008. Its publication turned him into something of an evangelist for Baclofen.</p> <p>With more than five million \u201cproblematic drinkers\u201d in France (120 people die from alcohol-related diseases every day), it was only a matter of time before addicts found themselves frantically banging on their primary care doctors\u2019 doors to get their hands on the treatment.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t that straightforward. The drug had to be prescribed off label (that is, not for its original medical use), which health authorities frowned at. To make matters worse, most doctors had never heard of it, and those who had were wary to recommend a treatment that could have severe side-effects, including severe insomnia, drowsiness, depression, heightened anxiety and mood changes.</p> <h2>\u2018I didn\u2019t care about secondary effects, I just wanted to be free from the booze\u2019</h2> <p>Blaise, too, had come to believe Baclofen was his last chance after reading online testimonials. In a frenzy, he contacted doctors in Canada, Lyon and Paris in the hope of finding someone willing to prescribe him the drug. He finally found Bernard Granger, a psychiatrist and addiction expert turned true believer in the treatment\u2019s efficacy. At the end of his tether, Blaise left a desperate message on his phone. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cI would do anything to get help.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later, the two met and talked about the treatment, potential side-effects and titration (the process of gradually adjusting the doses until optimal results are reached). Blaise signed a waiver absolving Granger of any wrongdoing in the event of his own death.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I suddenly understood my addiction was over. I\u2019ve been cured of my alcoholism ever since</p> <footer> <cite>Samuel Blaise</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 7 January 2011, full of hope, he swallowed his first pills.</p> <p>Blaise was, by his own account, not the perfect patient. Two weeks in, he was taking 340mg per day, way above the recommended dose (the French health safety agency allows for a maximum of 300mg, while most doctors in the UK prescribe less than 100mg). </p> <p>At this stage, Blaise recalls, \u201cI didn\u2019t care about secondary effects, I just wanted to be free from booze.\u201d He knew that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193236/\">studies</a> had shown very high doses are often necessary to produce a state of complete indifference to alcohol. He also knew there was a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3540966/\">significant relationship</a> between the amount of alcohol consumed before treatment and the maximal dose needed by patients to obtain results. </p> <p>In a 2008 French <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3540966/\">study</a>, 88% of patients reported \u201cat least one undesirable side-effect that could possibly be attributable to Baclofen\u201d, some so unbearable that patients had to stop treatment.</p> <p>As it turned out, the side-effects experienced by Blaise were brutal. He developed both psychotic and manic behaviors, couldn\u2019t sleep, had night sweats, muscle spasms, and his sense of taste and hearing changed. He found himself talking to God and thought he understood the world\u2019s great mysteries (in his delusion, he says, \u201cI was sure I had finally cracked the number pi in its entirety.\u201d) Granger promptly put him on antipsychotics, which induced a deep depression. He switched to antidepressants, which finally stabilized him.</p> <p>On 17 January, still drinking, Blaise got arrested for disorderly conduct and cocaine possession. He also had dozens of Baclofen pills on him, which police officers mistook for illicit drugs. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe a word I said,\u201d he said, still amused by the incident. \u201cThey were laughing hard when I begged them for the pills. I was kept in jail for 33 hours.\u201d</p> <p>But two weeks later, while walking the streets at 4am, he felt a sense of physical liberation come crashing over him. \u201cIt lasted for a few seconds. And I suddenly understood my addiction was over. I\u2019ve been cured of my alcoholism ever since.\u201d</p> <p>For the entirety of 2012, he stayed stone-cold sober. Nowadays, he says, he will \u201cdrink a glass of good wine or two when I have people over. But I can\u2019t drink more than that. I just don\u2019t crave it any more.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Clinical trials are in: Baclofen (kind of) works</h2> <p>In the years that followed Ameisen\u2019s discovery, medical authorities in France were put under enormous pressure to allow doctors to temporarily prescribe Baclofen for alcoholism while clinical studies were still under way. Associations of former addicts (which Blaise is now heavily involved in) lobbied hard, but it remained a tough sell \u2013 until now.</p> <p>One of their greatest victories came last week, when a study involving a significant number of patients partially confirmed its efficacy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.recherchecliniquepariscentre.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/bacloville_resume-proto_v1.1_accepte-cpp_20120423_SPT.pdf\">Bacloville</a>, the first study led by Philippe Jaury at the Paris Descartes University, administered high doses (the average was 160mg/day) to 320 volunteers aged 18-65 for a year while still allowing them to drink. A total of 56.8% of patients either became abstinent or significantly decreased their consumption to normal levels. The same results were observed in only 36.5% of patients who were given placebos.</p> <p>A second study, led by Michel Reynaud at the Paul Brousse hospital, had less impressive results. It tracked consumption in 320 patients who had already been abstinent for 20 weeks and ingested an average of 153 mg/day. Of those taking Baclofen 11.9% remained alcohol-free, while 10.5% of those on placebo did.</p> <p>Anne Lingford-Hughes, professor of addiction biology at Imperial College in London, attended the conference where the results were released. She thinks more data is needed to be truly conclusive on the Bacloville study but so far clinical trials, she says, support the idea that the more severely dependent on alcohol you are, the more likely you are to get benefits from Baclofen. </p> <p>But, she adds, there\u2019s a lot of concern in medical communities when it comes to giving it to people who drink heavily because of the drug/alcohol interaction, as well as potential overdoses. None of her colleagues in the UK, she says, would prescribe as high a dosage as is currently prescribed in France. </p> <h2>Not one drop: the problem with total abstinence</h2> <p>The success rate as reported by the Bacloville study is staggering \u2013 much higher than rehab centers or even spontaneous rates of recovery (a quarter of people addicted to alcohol eventually recover on their own, while many rehab rates <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-rehab-work/\">do not even reach that number</a>). </p> <p>But Dr Jaury, who led the study, says that the idea of such a cure prompted a swift reaction from those with a vested interested in seeing it fail.</p> <p>According to him, the backlash from the detox industry was swift and ferocious. There was also pushback from some members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), which he says promotes a culture of total abstinence. Jaury thinks it\u2019s a shame: \u201cI\u2019ve had patients who were in AA but still secretly took substitution drugs such as methadone or Subutex. They kept it a secret, out of shame and because they don\u2019t want to be excluded from the group.\u201d</p> <p>Blaise, who still takes Baclofen six years on, agrees and calls the abstinence model \u201cidiotic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor AA,\u201d he says, \u201cthe illness is incurable. So I would now have to go to a meeting and say \u2018hello, my name is Samuel and I am an alcoholic\u2019. But I am a former alcoholic, not an abstinent one.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec0b28b8441c7bd7b26c302e782bd1149ef728e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec0b28b8441c7bd7b26c302e782bd1149ef728e0/0_0_843_843/500.jpg\" alt=\"pill\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>He adds: \u201cThey function like a church. Their fourth step commands members to submit to a higher being, but suddenly, scientists arrive with a medication and rationally explain that a biological issue can be fixed. Suddenly, you don\u2019t need abstinence, you don\u2019t need a higher being. The very basis of the church comes crashing with it.\u201d</p> <p>Blaise says that while he greatly respects members, he has heard a sentiment akin to \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve to be cured\u201d from the AA crowd. This makes sense, he says, because to be in a constant state of craving is unthinkably hard. \u201cYou need to be at war with yourself to remain sober, minute after minute, day after day. AA people spend years, or even decades before they finally reach a state of indifference towards booze, whereas those of us who take Baclofen have to fight a mere few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, Blaise says some members believe people like him have merely replaced one drug with another. (When contacted directly, the French chapter of AA says it remains completely neutral on the subject \u2013 the organisation \u201chas a rule to never issue an opinion on topics outside our movement\u201d.)</p> <p>But what about those who can keep their lives together but drink a bit too much? </p> <p>Sylvie Imbert, a 59-year-old retired computer engineer who founded the French Baclofen Association, didn\u2019t hit rock bottom as Blaise did. Instead, as she was nearing 50, she simply became uncomfortable with the amount she was drinking. </p> <p>In 2009, she took matters in her own hands and made the two-hour trip from Toulouse to Spain, where Baclofen is sold over the counter. She began taking the drug without medical supervision, and promised herself she would stop should the side-effects prove too much (a process she doesn\u2019t recommend). When she reached 120mg a day, her cravings vanished. </p> <p>She now spends her time spreading the word and counseling people on her website\u2019s forum. \u201cWe have up to 2,000 visits a day,\u201d she says. A growing number of her readers are interested in Baclofen for other addictive behaviors, bulimia and gambling among them (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17647277\">a small 2007 trial</a> on seven patients showed that Baclofen reduced binge eating frequency).</p> <h2>Caution before zeal? The novelist who lost her mind to it</h2> <p>Sylvie Imbert and Samuel Blaise both had happy endings to their story. For others, Baclofen was devastating.</p> <p>In 2008, a British PR executive called Anna Sargent bought Baclofen online to finally stop drinking. She suffered severe side-effects and panic attacks when she stopped taking it, and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/10170103/PR-executive-killed-herself-after-taking-drug-she-found-online-to-treat-alcoholism-inquest-told.html\">killed herself</a> soon afterwards. Her parents blamed the drug, and said at the time that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t face more of these terrible effects of feeling anxious and suicidal\u201d. </p> <p>The story of Alix de Saint-Andr\u00e9, a renowned Parisian novelist, is another case in point. </p> <p>When Saint-Andr\u00e9 read about Baclofen, she decided to try the drug \u201cas an adventure\u201d in order to give up smoking. At the time she was chain-smoking three packs a day and had tried to quit many times without success.</p> <p>Under close supervision (a physician friend of hers who admired Ameisen\u2019s work agreed to give her a prescription), she holed herself in her country home during Christmas break to start the process, always making sure to stay within the recommended dosage. </p> <p>This was 2008, and while the protocol was relatively new, Saint-Andr\u00e9 was comforted by Ameisen\u2019s assurance that Baclofen\u2019s side-effects were \u201cas harmful as drinking a glass of water\u201d.</p> <p>Soon, however, she stopped sleeping and lost her appetite (she also started to write, and was delighted by her sudden rush of inspiration). A few days later, things took a turn for the worse. She had hallucinations, paced her bedroom endlessly, and found herself talking to saints and dead scholars.</p> <p>A friend of hers quickly became alarmed and forced her to check into a psychiatric hospital, where she stayed for four hellish weeks. In her memoir <a href=\"http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Blanche/L-angoisse-de-la-page-folle\">L\u2019Angoisse De La Page Folle</a>, Saint-Andr\u00e9 details how her full recovery would take a whole year, and included weekly sessions with a psychiatrist as well as anti-psychotics and anti-depressants.</p> <p>Her experience left her skeptical of a drug so many called \u201clife saving\u201d. As she researched what had happened to her, she found another case of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17047139\">Baclofen-induced psychosis</a> in medical literature, which spurred her to alert the media about it (they took little notice, she says). Saint-Andr\u00e9 worries that cases <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26264491\">similar to hers</a> are ignored by overenthusiastic doctors \u2013 and the thought of patients self-medicating with no professional supervision mortifies her.</p> <p>French doctors, she says, are quick to fight back with a utilitarian reasoning: if Baclofen can help half of the 120 people a day who die from alcohol-related diseases while only a tiny percentage experience severe side-effects, there\u2019s no question it should be used. \u201cI\u2019ve had doctors keen to remind me that some people died when the first vaccines were being tested on them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>After the publication of her book, Saint-Andr\u00e9 says she was contacted by readers with similar stories. One man told her about how his wife had been prescribed Baclofen by a dermatologist to, of all things, lose weight. </p> <p>Three weeks in, she started to suffer from paranoid delusions. Shortly thereafter, she threw herself out of a window.</p> <h2>Repeat it like a mantra: in addiction, no size fits all</h2> <p>As addiction experts are keen to remind us, there isn\u2019t \u201cone size fits all\u201d treatment to cure patients \u2013 something of a truism within the addiction field.</p> <p>Marc Lewis, a neuroscientist and former addict who wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Addicted-Brain-Neuroscientist-Examines/dp/1610392337\">Memoirs of an Addicted Brain</a>, is keen to highlight that a variety of different approaches can be therapeutic. \u201cThe therapy has to fit the person, not the substance [they\u2019re taking].\u201d</p> <p>But first, he says, physicians have to be trained to identify if a treatment is working, and most importantly trained to understand addiction (Lewis is keen to refer to addiction as a \u201ccognitive habit\u201d, as opposed to a chronic disease. A habit can learned, and therefore can be unlearned.)</p> <p>Medication might have saved people like Ameisen, but for others, AA, talking therapy, mindfulness, exercise and rehab treatment (or a combination) might work. \u201cPeople recover in very different ways,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cA lot of patients don\u2019t respond to medication. There\u2019s a lot of people with serious sex addiction, eating addiction, serious compulsive gambling problems \u2026 and medication can\u2019t do anything for them.\u201d</p> <p>Whether Baclofen will eventually become a staple for addictions other than alcoholism remains unclear. But armed with the clinical trial results published this September, the pharmaceutical company Ethypharm has already announced its intention to push for a full licensing of the drug specifically to treat alcoholism as soon as the full results of the Bacloville study are published.</p> <p>The race for a cure doesn\u2019t stop there. In the US, the pharmaceutical company Indivior has <a href=\"http://www.indivior.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Outlook-Addiction-Indivior_web.pdf\">licensed Placarbil</a>, a variant of the Baclofen molecule with more efficient pharmaceutical proprieties and improved absorption rates. Trials are under way, and results are expected at the end of the year. </p> <p>If the findings are encouraging, a similar controversy to the one currently unfolding in France will be sure to hit the US with some force.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Flint</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201cThe audience was fantastic but she was so nervous. She was like a nervous mess, and so I figured something \u2013 I figured something was up, really.\u201d \u2013 </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9-Hc295dJ4\">15 September, to Fox and Friends</a><br></p> <p>There is no evidence that the Rev Faith Green Timmons planned to interrupt Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Flint, Michigan, in which he veered off the city\u2019s water crisis and into criticism of Hillary Clinton.

  "<p>Landlords hand over as much as a fifth of their rent to letting agencies to look after a property, while tenants have to fork out a further \u00a3300 each. So should landlords be ditching the pricey high-street letting agents in favour of a raft of new online alternatives that promise to slash such costs and even axe fees to tenants altogether?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.noagent.co.uk/\">No Agent</a> is the latest firm to launch, claiming it will save a typical landlord \u00a31,600 in the first year, and leave tenants \u00a3337 better off. It joins a number of other online players such as <a href=\"https://www.upad.co.uk/\">Upad</a>, <a href=\"http://easyproperty.com\">easyProperty</a>, <a href=\"http://www.purplebricks.com/\">Purplebricks</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rentify.com\">Rentify</a>.</p> <p>The charges made by conventional letting agents can be breathtaking. For example, London and south-east agency <a href=\"https://www.foxtons.co.uk/help/fees/\">Foxtons</a> charges landlords 13.2% of the annual rent for finding a tenant, rising to 20.4% if the landlord also wants the agency to manage the property. Then there is a \u00a3420 admin fee, \u00a3165 to check-in a tenant, \u00a3150 for gas and electricity safety certificates (each), plus 12% of the value of any works above \u00a31,000 that need to be done on the property.</p> <p>Those are the charges that are levied on landlords. Foxtons then charges tenants a separate fee of \u00a3420 per property and \u00a3165 to organise a tenant check-out at the end of the tenancy. For someone letting a property at \u00a31,000 a month, fully managed by the agency, it means Foxtons will pick up around \u00a33,000 in fees in the first year alone.</p> <p>Letting agency fees vary markedly around England \u2013 and in Scotland fees to tenants are banned. According to David Cox, managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, there are three levels of fees.</p> <p>The basic is just to find a tenant, handle the vetting and contracts. Typically it\u2019s around 6%-10% of the first year\u2019s rent, or, for a flat, a pre-agreed fee. The second level is to find a tenant and handle the monthly rent collection, usually 8%-12% of the rent. Finally, the full service of tenant finding, collection and management, including repairs, can be as high as 20% of the rent.</p> <p>Cox says the vast majority of landlords prefer to deal with a conventional high street letting agent, likening them to British Airways versus a no-frills airline. \u201cThe landlord is charged one fee and everything is included. The online agents often have what looks like a cheap basic fee, but then they bill you for everything else, such as viewings.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d0d29f76ac178ada7e96e95cb046efea5e09e0b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0d29f76ac178ada7e96e95cb046efea5e09e0b6/0_2_553_1224/452.jpg\" alt=\"rental table\" width=\"452\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>New regulations \u2013 such as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents/who-to-check\">right to rent</a>\u201d immigration checks \u2013 are also encouraging landlords to use traditional agents to ensure they are complying with the law, he says.</p> <p>But the online agents argue they can do everything a traditional agent does, but at a fraction of the cost. Crucially, they are able to advertise on Rightmove and Zoopla, where nine out of 10 prospective tenants now find a property. Charges start at around \u00a3100 for advertising on the major property portals, to around \u00a3500-\u00a3600 a year for a full property management service, although a menu of charges is not unusual.</p> <p>For example, No Agent charges a flat fee of \u00a339 a month in London or \u00a329 outside for management. There\u2019s an additional \u00a390 to handle viewings for the first 30 days, \u00a390 for photography, \u00a365 for floor plans and \u00a390 for safety certificates. Tenants are not asked for a penny.</p> <p>Calum Brannan, the 27-year-old founder of No Agent, says: \u201cThe lettings agency market has been overpriced for way too long. For example, we don\u2019t charge for credit checks, but then Experian is almost giving them away. It gives you an idea of the huge mark-ups that traditional letting agents are making.\u201d</p> <p>But can a landlord really trust an online agent to handle the very human issues of finding tenants and dealing with issues as they arise, such as broken washing machines, or damp building up in the corner of a room?</p> <p>No Agent says it has a 24-hour call centre for tenants and landlords to ring, with a network of property professionals in every part of the UK who will handle issues as they arise. When it comes to arranging viewings, it promises that someone can be at the landlord\u2019s property the next day to show a prospective tenant around. Equally, it says, landlords are free to handle viewings themselves.Upad is the largest online letting agency, handling around 1,250 lettings a month. It charges \u00a3118.80 for its most basic service, which is getting the landlord\u2019s property advertised on Rightmove and Zoopla, through to \u00a3598.80 for its full management service, although it won\u2019t handle initial viewings.</p> <p>Founder James Davis says the key advantage of an online letting agent is that it lets landlords do the bits they want to do, while leaving the agency to pick up the rest. He says that 80% of landlords \u201cself-manage to some degree, and most want to meet the tenants face to face before letting\u201d. He adds that 90% of tenants say they would rather see the landlord at a viewing than the agent. \u201cOur model is less about cutting costs and more about offering a fuller service. We are probably the most expensive of the online agents, but we do a lot more hand-holding for landlords than the others.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Obama administration has agreed to pay \u20ac1m (\u00a3850,000) to the family of an Italian aid worker who was killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan in 2015.</p> <p>It is the first known and documented payment of its kind made by the US government to the family of a drone-strike victim killed outside a declared warzone. </p> <p>Giovanni Lo Porto, 37, was being held hostage by al-Qaida at the time of his death and his family had been led to believe a month before the strike that he was close to being released.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/23/giovanni-lo-porto-killed-us-drone-strike-incredibly-loyal-friend\">Giovanni Lo Porto, killed in US drone strike, was \u2018incredibly loyal\u2019 friend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year, the US president, Barack Obama, acknowledged that Lo Porto and an American named Warren Weinstein, 73, had accidentally been killed in a secret counter-terrorism mission and expressed his regret for the deaths.</p> <p>The payment was confirmed by the US embassy in Rome and Lo Porto\u2019s brother, Daniele. Details of the agreement were first reported by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the US embassy in Rome said the government had confirmed at the time the deaths were announced that it would be providing a condolence payment to both families. </p> <p>\u201cWe did that knowing that no dollar figure would ever bring back their loved ones and, out of respect for the families, we are not sharing any details of those payments,\u201d they said.</p> <p>It is not clear whether the Weinstein family has also received a payment. </p> <p>Experts say it is already understood that the US offers condolence payments to the families of civilian casualties of airstrikes in Afghanistan and Iraq, but that the Lo Porto agreement stands out because he was killed in Pakistan and because documents show the US was directly involved in the payment. </p> <p>In Yemen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/02/yemen-faisal-bin-ali-jaber-no-apology-drone-strike\">Faisal bin Ali Jaber</a>, whose nephew and brother-in-law were killed in a 2012 drone strike, received a cash payment of $100,000 from a Yemeni official, and no acknowledgement or apology from the US. </p> <p>The agreement between the US government and the Lo Porto family was signed on 8 July, according to documents obtained by La Repubblica that were shared with the Guardian. The payment \u2013 \u20ac1,185,000 in total \u2013 was considered a \u201cdonation in the memory of Giovanni Lo Porto\u201d.<br></p> <p>The agreement was signed by a diplomat named Garrett Stephen Wayne, in his role as financial management centre director of the US embassy in Rome. The agreement clarified that Lo Porto was killed in Pakistan. The White House acknowledged at the time of the announcement that he was killed in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The payment was made to Lo Porto\u2019s mother, Giusy, who lives in Palermo, and his father, Vito.</p> <p>The agreement includes this stipulation: \u201cThis does not imply the consent by the United States of America to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Italian courts in disputes, if any, directly or indirectly connected with this instrument. Nothing in this instrument implies a waiver to sovereign or personal immunity.\u201d</p> <p>Jack Serle, an expert on the drone programme and journalist at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, said it was the first time he had heard of such a payment that had demonstrably come from the US Treasury. </p> <p>\u201cIt has been a common tool in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is not accepting responsibility, but is used to try to soothe the anger, essentially saying sorry for the event and for what happened, while also not accepting responsibility,\u201d Serle said.</p> <p>People who study the issue said it was far from clear whether the development signified a shift in policy in favour of the families of victims.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of impact this will have on all the other people who think they may have claims because nominally those strikes remain unavowed,\u201d Serle said.</p> <p>Jennifer Gibson, from the human rights group Reprieve, said payments were not a substitute for genuine transparency.</p> <p>\u201cI think at this point there is no indication that this goes beyond the compensation of a western hostage killed in a drone strike,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThe Lo Porto and Weinstein families are the only families that have been acknowledged and apologised to by the administration. Thus far there hasn\u2019t been a single Pakistani or Yemeni family that has received the same acknowledgment.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, Lo Porto\u2019s mother expressed her sorrow about his death: \u201cI will not see my son at home with his smile. They took my precious son and they also killed me. Now all that remains for me is to wait until the last day of my life for divine, not earthly, justice.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/23/statement-president-deaths-warren-weinstein-and-giovanni-lo-porto\">The White House acknowledged the US killed Lo Porto and Weinstein</a> last April, four months after the drone strike in January against an al-Qaida compound.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has acknowledged that Barack Obama was born in the United States, though the Republican candidate himself refused to say where he believed the US president\u2019s birthplace was.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-campaign-statement\">emailed statement </a>from senior communications adviser Jason Miller late on Thursday night, the campaign stated: \u201cMr Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States.\u201d</p> <p>It followed an interview with the Washington Post published on Thursday in which the Republican nominee, who has fanned false rumours the US\u2019s first black president was not born in the country, said he would not answer <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-defiant-as-polls-rise-wont-say-obama-was-born-in-united-states/2016/09/15/48913162-7b61-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html\">when asked if he believed Obama was born in Hawaii</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer that question at the right time. I just don\u2019t want to answer it yet,\u201d he said. Trump also brushed off a recent statement from his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway that Trump \u201cnow believed\u201d Obama was born in the US by saying: \u201cIt\u2019s OK.

Inarguably, Donald J Trump is a closer.\u201d </p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/232572505238433794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweeted </a>in 2012 that the birth certificate may been \u201ca fraud\u201d and <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/time-donald-trump-talked-birtherism/story?id=41927366\">continued to raise questions</a> about its veracity long afterwards. The false allegations that Obama was born in Kenya were widely considered to be a racist dogwhistle.</p> <p>Obama was born in Honolulu on 4 August 1961.</p> <p>In a 2014 interview, Trump\u2019s oldest son Donald Jr, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-jr-in-2014-praised-his-dads-moral-conviction-on-obama?utm_term=.ohLMe1Dxy#.tc8qA2orM\">praised</a> the New York real estate developer\u2019s birtherism as a sign of his father\u2019s integrity. \u201cDon\u2019t we want politicians to have strong opinions about things that aren\u2019t swayed by public opinion,\u201d asked the younger Trump.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Clinton was quick to cite Trump\u2019s initial refusal to back away from birtherism as evidence that the Republican nominee was fanning the flames of racial division.</p> <p>Addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute at its annual gala in Washington on Thursday evening, Clinton condemned Trump for continuing to push conspiracy theories surrounding Obama\u2019s birthplace.</p> <p>\u201cHe still wouldn\u2019t say Hawaii. He still wouldn\u2019t say America,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said.</p> <p>\u201cThis man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\u201d</p> <p>In her remarks before the gathering of prominent Hispanic leaders, Clinton reiterated her support for comprehensive immigration reform while decrying Trump\u2019s rhetoric against immigrants and Muslims alike.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no innuendo or dog whistles any more,\u201d Clinton said of the Republican nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s all right out there in the open now.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day Trump reiterated his economic vision, pledging to voters that he would \u201clower your taxes beyond any number you thought possible\u201d at a rally in New Hampshire.<br></p> <p>The promise came just hours after Trump unveiled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-jobs-vision-25-million-economic-policy\">the latest iteration</a> of his fiscal policy at the New York Economic Club in a speech where he said he outlined the ambitious goal of creating 25 million jobs over the next 10 years. The Republican nominee promised to drastically slash taxes with savings coming from reducing federal bureaucrats whom his campaign has derided with phrases like \u201cthe FDA Food Police\u201d. Trump pledged that the result would increase economic growth from 2% to 3.5% and \u201cturn America into a magnet for new jobs\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s remarks came after her four-day absence due to pneumonia. Before the Washington event, she first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">returned to the campaign trail</a> with a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. Taking stage to James Brown\u2019s I Feel Good, the former secretary of state said she took sick days to \u201creflect\u201d. </p> <p>Clinton told the crowd: \u201cBeing on the trail does not encourage reflection. It\u2019s important to sit with your thoughts every now and again and this helped me to reflect on what this campaign is all about.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton, who has been reluctant to take questions from reporters on the campaign trail, later held a brief press conference after her speech where she dodged repeated questions about when she told running mate Tim Kaine about her diagnosis. </p> <p>The subject of health was relevant for both candidates as an interview of Trump with television personality Dr Mehmet Oz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report\">aired on Thursday.</a> There, Trump brandished a doctor\u2019s letter and insisted that, although he could lose a few pounds, he was in peak health. In December, Trump\u2019s doctor, Harold Bornstein previously published a letter that said Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d. The Republican nominee is a septuagenarian fond of fast food who doesn\u2019t exercise. </p> <p>The Republican nominee also continued his hostility towards reporters. Trump bragged at his New Hampshire speech that his travelling press pool wasn\u2019t able to attend, which he called \u201creally good news\u201d and proclaimed to a cheering crowd: \u201cI love it.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day, he called for the New York Times to fire their respected national political correspondent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmartnyt?lang=en\">Jonathan Martin</a> while also railing against CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, a debate moderator, because Cooper was \u201cvery biased\u201d and worked for \u201cthe Clinton News Network\u201d.</p> <p>Donald Jr joined in on the act when he told a Philadelphia radio station that \u201cthe media has been [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] number one surrogate in this\u201d. The Trump son added \u201cwithout the media, this wouldn\u2019t even be a contest, but the media has built her up. They\u2019ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy [sic], on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing. If Republicans were doing that, they\u2019d be warming up the gas chamber right now.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign quickly bashed Donald Jr\u2019s comments as \u201cinsensitive, divisive, and reckless\u201d. In a statement, the campaign added \u201cthe bottom line is this \u2013 offensive references to the Holocaust are never acceptable, especially from a presidential campaign\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists have just <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/06/1605782113.abstract\">published a startling analysis</a> of commonly used words in 4298 languages (62% of all those spoken). They wanted to find out if there were associations between particular sounds and meanings that couldn\u2019t be put down to the fact that the languages were related, are used close to one another, or to chance. </p> <p>As it turned out, they detected strong correlations between sounds and meanings that were independent of genetic relationship, borrowing or coincidence. For example, words for \u201csmall\u201d often contained high front vowels (roughly, \u201cee\u201d as in \u201cpeak\u201d or \u201csee\u201d); words for \u201cround\u201d and \u201cred\u201d were linked to \u201cr\u201d sounds; words for \u201cstar\u201d to \u201cz\u201d and words for \u201cfull\u201d to bilabial consonants (\u201cp\u201d and \u201cb\u201d). Associations were found for body parts: \u201ctongue\u201d was correlated with \u201cl\u201d and \u201cnose\u201d with \u201cn\u201d. Remember, these similarities were found in languages as distant from one another as English and Tagalog, Yoruba and Mandarin.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Breasts' are associated with 'm', and 'this might be due to the mouth configuration of suckling babies'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why does this matter? One of the first things a student of linguistics learns is that the relationship between the signifier (the sound of a word) and the signified (the concept it represents) is <a href=\"http://personal.bgsu.edu/~dcallen/saussure.html\">arbitrary</a>. We use the word \u201ctree\u201d to signify a plant with a trunk and leaves, but there\u2019s nothing particularly tree-like about the combination \u201ct-r-e-e\u201d. If a law was passed saying we had to call it \u201cfrave\u201d instead, that word would gradually become normal, just like \u201cki\u201d is for Japanese speakers and \u201cumthi\u201d for Xhosa.<br></p> <p>This is part of what gives human language its immense productive power. New words can be coined and they don\u2019t have to be tied in any way to the concept they represent. Just the convention linking that sound and the concept in people\u2019s minds is enough. </p> <p>There are some exceptions: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia\">onomatopoeic</a> words like \u201csmash\u201d or \u201cjudder\u201d have physical qualities which do slightly resemble the things they describe. But the idea that this \u201csound symbolism\u201d extends much further than a few childish curiosities has long been dismissed by most linguists.</p> <p>Damian Blasi and his colleagues focussed on 30 fundamental concepts \u2013 none of which represent loud or distinctive noises, often fertile ground for onomatopoeia. These came from the famous \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list\">Swadesh list</a>\u201d of 100 basic words, and included \u201cbite\u201d, \u201cdrink\u201d, \u201cear\u201d, \u201cleaf\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201ctooth\u201d, \u201cskin\u201d, \u201cone\u201d and \u201cstone\u201d. Incredibly, as well as positive links, they uncovered sets of sounds these words seem to \u201cavoid\u201d \u2013 ones that appear much less often than you would expect if it were down to chance. \u201cWater\u201d (strangely enough for English speakers) seems to avoid the \u201ct\u201d sound. Words for \u201ctooth\u201d avoid \u201cb\u201d and \u201cm\u201d. The \u201ca\u201d \u201ch\u201d and \u201cr\u201d sounds are found less commonly in words for \u201cbreasts\u201d. </p> <p>The study builds on earlier research which hinted at non-arbitrary relationships between sound and meaning. For example, people have been able to successfully <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/223394\">pair up words</a> that have opposite meanings in languages they don\u2019t know. One study showed that English speakers could make better-than-chance <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12361/abstract\">guesses</a> at the concreteness of unfamiliar foreign words \u2013 that\u2019s to say, whether a word might mean something like \u201ccar\u201d versus something like \u201chappiness\u201d. Intimations, if you like, of a universal language of sound. </p> <p>That leaves us with the question: why? In the 19th century, the founder of modern linguistics, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-de-Saussure\">Ferdinand de Saussure</a>, made arbitrariness the central plank of his theory of language. His insights are still pretty powerful. But as the science developed, it seemed to become more and more divorced from the world in which language is used, and the bodies and minds that use it. This trend culminated with ideas about a genetically encoded \u201clanguage module\u201d in the brain, possessed of a language-specific set of rules that determine not just the structure of English, but of Swedish, Burmese, Kazakh, Czech, you name it. </p> <p>Those schools of thought are identified with theorists such as Stephen Pinker and Noam Chomsky. Others believe that language isn\u2019t necessarily hived off, that its structures are determined by an interplay of forces that include general principles of cognition, logical relationships (like cause and effect) and shared environment. </p> <p>Blasi et al, for their part, say that the explanation must lie in \u201cfactors common to our species\u201d, which leaves things fairly open. They point out the association of \u201cnose\u201d with nasal sounds and \u201ctongue\u201d with \u201cl\u201d sounds \u2013 saying that a link between body parts and the sounds they make has been noted before. \u201cBreasts\u201d are associated with \u201cm\u201d and \u201cthis might be due to the mouth configuration of suckling babies or to the sounds babies produce\u201d. </p> <p>So far, so not particularly mysterious \u2013 although the embedding into actual language of these properties is extraordinary if you think about it. But what about \u201cleaf\u201d, \u201cstar\u201d, \u201cround\u201d, \u201cred\u201d \u201cwater\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d? There are clearly some missing pieces of the jigsaw.

  "<p>Neither Super Bowls, nor frivolous NFL prediction games are won in September. Veteran participants in our Pick Six contest will know that one strong week can easily melt away into a midseason mess of analysis paralysis and unjustifiable faith in Chip Kelly. But there is a certain special kind of glory that comes with calling all six games correctly on the opening weekend. And it is only made better by knowing that nobody else achieved the same. </p> <p>So step forward, <strong>stephentheaardvark</strong>, take a bow and give the little people a wave. And then get back to scouring the stat sheets for the games listed below. You have a lead to maintain. </p> <p><strong>Kansas City Chiefs @ Houston Texans (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</strong></p> <p>Will this be catharsis or just another catastrophe for Houston? The Texans\u2019 2015 season ended with a 30-0 home playoff defeat to Kansas City, and few of the fans in attendance back then could have hoped to see the Chiefs return to NRG Stadium so soon. But Houston\u2019s offense has been transformed by the additions of Brock Osweiler, Lamar Miller and the rookie wideout Will Fuller, whilst Kansas City\u2019s defensive backfield has lost Sean Smith, Tyvon Branch and Husain Abdullah. The Chiefs struggled to contain San Diego in week one before Keenan Allen went down injured. Have they regressed, or are they simply slow starters? <strong>Texans to win</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/13/rookie-quarterbacks-struggles-nfl-history\">Like the fullback position before it, is the quarterback bust going out of style?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Cincinnati Bengals @ Pittsburgh Steelers (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</strong></p> <p>Division rivals or not, both Cincinnati and Pittsburgh might do well to put less focus on winning this game and more on simply surviving it. Last season, Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict almost single-handedly extinguished the Steelers\u2019 Super Bowl hopes by injuring each of Le\u2019Veon Bell, Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger. And yet, Pittsburgh were still able to squeeze past Cincinnati in the playoffs after Andy Dalton\u2019s season had been ended by a fractured thumb suffered during these teams\u2019 second regular-season meeting. Burfict will miss this game through suspension, as will Bell, but the match-up I\u2019m most interested in is the one between the latter player\u2019s replacement \u2013 DeAngelo Williams \u2013 and a Bengals defense that was gouged for 5.1 yards per carry last week by the Jets. <strong>Steelers to win</strong></p> <p><strong>Dallas Cowboys @ Washington (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59df10801ce05891e678f051cb374038ad6bfc60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59df10801ce05891e678f051cb374038ad6bfc60/0_215_3376_2025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ezekiel Elliott scored his first NFL touchdown in week one\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ezekiel Elliott scored his first NFL touchdown in week one.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Jenkins/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington\u2019s run to an NFC East title in 2015 was founded on an impressive 6-2 record at home. If Jay Gruden hopes to steer his team back to the playoffs, then he can ill-afford to start this season with consecutive defeats at FedEx Field. The coach needs to make better decisions than he did against Pittsburgh, punting on fourth-and-one from the Steelers\u2019 40-yard line on the game\u2019s opening drive, only to later go for the first down \u2013 and fail \u2013 on fourth-and-six from a similar position. Most of all, though, Gruden needs to get his team\u2019s run defense fixed, or else this could easily become a break-out game for Ezekiel Elliott, ably assisted by former Washington man Alfred Morris. <strong>Cowboys to win</strong></p> <p><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars @ San Diego Chargers (Sunday 4.25pm ET/9.25pm BST)</strong></p> <p>Can the Chargers rebound from Keenan Allen\u2019s injury? The speed with which the wind dropped from their sails after he went down against the Chiefs was startling. With Allen on the field, San Diego racked up 16 first downs and three touchdowns in less than one half of football. Without him, it sputtered to nine first downs and a pair of field goals the rest of the way. The Chargers\u2019 coaching staff has at least had a week of practice to rearrange their receiving corps and seek to cover for his absence. But Jacksonville\u2019s upgraded secondary held Aaron Rodgers to under 200 yards passing last weekend. <strong>Jaguars to win</strong></p> <p><strong>Green Bay Packers @ Minnesota Vikings (Sunday 8.30pm ET/Monday 1.30am BST)</strong></p> <p>Will it be Sam Bradford behind center for the Vikings in their first regular season game at US Bank Stadium? Sunday will mark his 14th day with the team, hardly sufficient for a quarterback to learn every nuance of a new playbook, but Minnesota did not pay such a steep price just to have him sit on the bench this year. Besides, it was the Vikings\u2019 defense that carried them to victory in against Tennessee, just as it had on the road in Green Bay in week 17 of last season. Both Bradford and Shaun Hill are more than capable of matching the 99 yards that Teddy Bridgewater threw for that day. But can the defense rise to the occasion once again against opponents who have regained Jordy Nelson in the interim? <strong>Packers to win</strong></p> <p><strong>Philadelphia Eagles @ Chicago Bears (Monday 8.35pm ET/Tuesday 1.35 am BST)</strong></p> <p>All aboard the Carson Wentz bandwagon? Philadelphia\u2019s rookie quarterback sparkled on his NFL debut, leading the Eagles 75 yards down the field for a score on their very first possession and setting the tone for a 29-10 win over Cleveland. In the week since, Wentz\u2019s jersey has become the top seller on the NFL\u2019s website, and <a href=\"http://www.csnphilly.com/the700level/president-obama-gives-carson-wentz-shoutout-philly\">he even got a name-check from the president</a>. And look, it would be easy to bundle the Bears in with the Browns as another Bad Team just waiting to be rolled over. But this is a road game, in prime time, against a defense that has more talent than it showed in week one. And Jay Cutler, flawed though he is, can still put up points in tandem with Alshon Jeffery. <strong>Bears to win</strong></p>",
  "<p><sup>\u201c</sup>He\u2019s trying to wrest back control of the agenda,\u201d said my editor, on hearing the announcement that David Cornwell, aka John le Carr\u00e9, was writing a&#xa0;memoir, only days before the publication of my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/25/john-le-carre-biography-adam-sisman-review\" title=\"\"><em>John le Carr\u00e9: The Biography</em></a><em>. </em>Several people have suggested to me that to bring out such a memoir \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/08/the-pigeon-tunnel-john-le-carre-review-memoir-autobiography\" title=\"\"><em>The Pigeon Tunnel</em></a>, published last week \u2013 within 12 months of the publication of my book is an \u201cunhelpful\u201d act on his part \u2013 even, perhaps, an unfriendly one.</p> <p>A degree of disgruntlement on his part would not be surprising. Though my biography was written with my subject\u2019s cooperation, it would be disingenuous to pretend that there was no strain between us during the four years I spent writing his life. I don\u2019t think that I should have been doing my job properly if there hadn\u2019t been: I saw it as my job to uncover the truth, however painful that might be. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much more of this I can stand,\u201d David said to me after one session. I can only imagine how hard it&#xa0;was for him to have a comparative stranger explore every room of his life, from attic to basement, to expose his mistakes and quarrels, and to probe his&#xa0;sore spots. \u201cI think our continuing relationship is an achievement in itself,\u201d David wrote to me in 2014. So it is only right that I should acknowledge his generosity, his tolerance and his continuing sense of humour. There were some tense moments during those four years, but there were also a&#xa0;lot of laughs. \u201cI know it\u2019s supposed to&#xa0;be warts and all,\u201d he said to me at one point, \u201cbut so far as I can gather, it\u2019s going to be all warts and no all.\u201d</p> <p>Of course there was a bit of needle too. At one stage he outlined the plot of&#xa0;a new novel he was planning. \u201cIt\u2019s about an elderly spy in retirement,\u201d he told me, \u201cwho is visited by a younger man investigating his past.\u201d I began to catch his drift. \u201cIs the younger man unsubtle, repeatedly missing the point and going off at a tangent?\u201d I asked. \u201cDoes he have unfortunate table manners? Perhaps even a disfigurement?\u201d David smiled: \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p> <p>So I was pleased to receive a gracious letter from him on the day my biography was published, and further pleased to receive an inscribed copy of his memoir a few days before it appeared in the shops. This book has a&#xa0;long history: he had been toying with the idea of writing some kind of memoir for more than half a century, in fact as long as he has been writing novels, and&#xa0;had made at least two previous attempts at it, in 1979 and again in 2001. In retrospect, I wonder whether my book might have been the catalyst that enabled him to finally write his.</p> <p><em>The Pigeon Tunnel </em>is subtitled \u201cStories from a Life\u201d. Its introduction contains a passing reference to my book: \u201cA recently published account of my life offers thumbnail versions of one or two of the stories, so it naturally pleases me to reclaim them as my own, tell them in my own voice, and invest them as best I can with my own feelings.\u201d</p> <p>There is an element of pulling rank in this statement: these are my stories, he is saying, and I can tell them best. And since he is an excellent raconteur, he tells them very well.</p> <p>It is worth observing that the same story may receive different treatment in a biography and a memoir. Memoir is what you can remember: biography aspires to objective truth. In his introduction, David describes these as \u201ctrue stories told from memory \u2013 to which you are entitled to ask, what is truth and what is memory? \u2026 But please be assured: Nowhere have I consciously falsified an event or a story. Disguised where necessary, yes. Falsified, emphatically not. And where my memory is shaky, I have taken care to say so.\u201d He makes no claim to factual accuracy. \u201cFor the creative writer,\u201d he says, \u201cfact is raw material, not his taskmaster but his instrument, and his job is to make it sing. Real truth lies, if anywhere, not in facts, but in nuance.\u201d</p> <p>This reads well enough, but what does it mean in practice? While at work&#xa0;on my biography I found myself repeatedly questioning the veracity of what I was being told. Let me give you an example. In his book David provides a charming account of a visit to Paris at the age of only 16, dispatched by his father to recover money from the Panamanian ambassador, a grey-haired count. \u201cThe door to the elegant house is opened by the most desirable woman I had ever seen,\u201d he writes, and he describes how she comes on to the innocent schoolboy throughout the remainder of the evening, squeezing his hand, caressing his leg and nibbling his ear as they sip daiquiris, discuss business and dine in a favourite Russian restaurant. Back at the house the count announces that they are ready for bed, and the countess indicates that David should join them. The schoolboy stumbles through his excuses and flees.</p> <p>As told in <em>The Pigeon Tunnel</em>, this is&#xa0;a&#xa0;delightful story of innocence and naughtiness. My difficulty with it is that he has given an account of this visit before, with none of this nuance. In that version there was no suggestion of seduction: the countess was dismissed in a single phrase, and David was accompanied throughout by his older brother. So which are we to believe?</p> <p>Maybe I am being a bore. \u201cI fear that&#xa0;my role will be to spoil a fund of amusing anecdotes,\u201d I joked to David soon after we first met. These are his stories, and if he lent me a few of them for a while, he is entitled to reclaim them. It is, after all, his life.</p>",
  "<p>Junior doctors are used to managing crisis situations. Lifesaving treatments, long hours, dealing with dying patients, and coping with poor resources are all situations they would expect to wrestle with during their training. These young men and women want to cure the world \u2013 this is ingrained in their excellent and rigorous training, which might take anything up to 15 years.</p> <p>So why is this important? You don\u2019t have to live on Mars to know that the British Medical Association (BMA) \u2013 specifically, the junior doctors\u2019 arm of it \u2013 and the government, namely health secretary Jeremy Hunt, are at odds. </p> <p>It has become increasingly clear that Hunt has won the battle. Negotiations with the BMA have not just stalled, they have broken down because they failed to deliver the contract junior doctors felt was right for them and safe for patient care. </p> <p>Hunt has a different view \u2013 not only does he think it is safe for patients, but he believes that it doesn\u2019t discriminate against female doctors (over 60% of doctors are women), it offers a good work-life balance, and crucially it will deliver a seven-day service. His case is enhanced by the fact that junior doctors\u2019 leaders endorsed the contract before consulting committee members. To some this is a matter of pay and conditions, while to others (not just within the BMA) it is a broader issue involving the current state of the NHS.</p> <p>So is all well in the Hunt camp? Probably, insofar as the imposition of the contract is concerned. On the other hand, the BMA came to a rather desperate juncture. Its highest body, the council, backed the junior doctors\u2019 committee\u2019s demand to run an unprecedented series of five-day strikes. There was frustration, anger and even desperation at the inability of the government to see their viewpoint, fuelled no doubt by Hunt\u2019s reappointment as health secretary. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/aug/26/jeremy-hunt-can-not-bully-his-plans-for-a-seven-day-nhs-through\">Jeremy Hunt cannot bully his seven-day NHS plans through</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the cold light of day, the BMA realised that it would fall foul of the very reasons it was against the contract imposition \u2013 it had given trusts very little time to put together a contingency plan to safely cover the five days of the September strikes. It risked harm to patients, the very issue its 170,000 members feel is sacrosanct. The General Medical Council waded in, as did some of the medical royal colleges, ensuring the divisions in the senior medical fraternity were played out in the public and the media. A rapid climbdown by the BMA was inevitable, leading to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/junior-doctors-suspend-planned-five-day-strike-in-september\">announcement that the September five-day strikes were off</a>, further playing into Hunt\u2019s hands.</p> <p>To his credit, Hunt has not been gloating in this victory. He has adopted a dignified approach, welcoming the decision by the BMA but remaining steadfastly rooted in his conviction that the contract imposition would remain regardless. Last week, at Expo 2016 in Manchester he was very cordial, courteous and in consolatory mood. He expressed his wish to move forward.</p> <p>Even BMA stalwarts might reluctantly agree that he is winning the battle. The imposition will proceed, without any further changes, unless he softens his approach. </p> <p>However, Hunt should have no illusions. This is a hollow victory. Juniors are now a disaffected, angry, disillusioned and frustrated lot. These are the consultants and GPs of tomorrow, the very doctors the government needs to fulfil its plans for a round-the-clock, stellar NHS. Many feel that their professionalism and dreams have been thwarted by the government, and those who are really hacked off have emigrated. </p> <p>The dispute is being played out against a background of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/10/hospitals-on-brink-of-collapse-say-health-chiefs\">an escalating funding crisis</a>, trusts being unable to meet increasing demand and a warning that the health service will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/12/nhs-facing-pockets-of-meltdown-this-winter\">experience \u201cpockets of meltdown\u201d this winter</a>. We could go on.</p> <p>In the face of such adversity, the NHS is hardly able to deliver a five-day service, let alone the seven-day NHS Hunt dreams about. He has wrongly aligned his aspirations for a seven-day service to delivering the junior doctors\u2019 contract. The BMA has repeatedly asked him to define his vision to enable a constructive dialogue on what is evidence-based, and what is achievable. What is clear is that both the BMA and Hunt require a highly motivated, energetic and engaged medical workforce to deliver the high-quality care needed to manage complex illnesses and meet rising demand. </p> <p>The government is responsible for creating the conditions for safe working of our juniors and for providing and delivering safe services. Hunt must work hard to win the hearts and minds of junior doctors to achieve the ultimate goal of providing safe, high-quality services seven days a week. Theresa May should conduct her own appraisal of the state of the NHS and the problems it faces, and make her priority settling this dispute and finding more money for the health service.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>When Nigel Farage set up Ukip it was to campaign for an EU referendum. I asked him at the time what he would do if he got one. He said he would try to win it. And what would he do if he won, or if he lost? Either way, he said, his job would be done. He would go down to the pub. Farage has been as good as his word.</p> <p>Ukip was no more than Farage\u2019s vehicle. It was not really a party but a lobby group for a single issue, that of securing a popular vote on whether or not to stay in the EU. It has achieved that aim.</p> <p>Ukip\u2019s purpose is fulfilled. The leader who gave it direction and distinctive personality has departed for the promised pub. The party should disband. Its work is done.</p> <p>The Ukip conference commenced with the assumed pretence that it is a \u201cproper party\u201d. Yet it is already displaying the symptoms of purposelessness that comes when any association has departed from its reason for existing.</p> <p>It is like Nato in Afghanistan. The party\u2019s leadership campaign is riven with faction. The candidates, pygmies alongside Farage, appear universally unappealing and ill at ease with each other. Mass defection seems likely to occur. Stopping that will be the chief task of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/16/ukip-conference-nigel-farages-last-speech-as-leader-politics-live\" title=\"\">the new leader, Diane James.</a></p> <p>To survive, a modern party requires not just a cause. It needs to be able to distribute the rewards of patronage and power to its members. It needs the smell of power, not just of influence. Ukip never was able to build up a group of MPs, as have the Liberal Democrats even in their worst hours. It has a presence, but no hold, in local government. There is no core group of loyalists to hold it together.</p> <p>The prevailing narrative is that Ukip is still needed to hold the May government to the Brexit cause. But the government has shown not the slightest intention of retreating from Brexit, however hard progress may be in that direction. The job of guarding Brexit has been taken on by a more substantial body, both in parliament and in the country: that of the overwhelming majority of the Tory party.</p> <p>Ukip has lost that capacity to dictate policy. The electorate stole it away and handed the task to the Tories.</p> <p>May is clearly determined to leave no room to critics on her right wing. She has been adamant throughout the Brexit debate that she will meet the central Ukip demand, of regaining control of Britain\u2019s borders and bringing a limit to mass immigration. If she fails, it will not be for want of trying.</p> <p>In addition, she has astonished even her own supporters by seizing Ukip\u2019s most eccentric policy, a return to the 1950s <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2016/09/full-text-theresa-mays-speech-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">and a separatist secondary education system</a>. To want to divide Britain\u2019s teenage population \u2013 one-third, two-thirds \u2013 on lines of \u201cability\u201d and religion and, de facto, on income and social class is a move so retrogressive that Ukip should disband in May\u2019s honour on this cause alone. The bulk of Ukip\u2019s support over the past five years has come from people indistinguishable from the present prime minister.</p> <p>Ukip came into being in the steps of the short-lived <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum_Party\" title=\"\">Referendum party</a>. It has always occupied the vague, single-issue role on the party\u2019s right that the Greens have occupied on Labour\u2019s left.</p> <p>The party\u2019s fate is now to descend into the grimy fringes of British politics. Farage often spoke of the nightmarish members he had attracted, even as he succeeded in scuppering the old British National party.</p> <p>As moderate Ukippers return to the Tory fold, the party will be left with its least attractive faction, the racists and xenophobes who were so often Farage\u2019s curse: men and women whose sole common cause seemed to be a collective unpleasantness, and hatred for some perceived foe.</p> <p>Last June the British people rebelled, peacefully but emphatically, against what it saw as the ruling class. It was a gesture of democratic defiance: to some, an act of mob rule; to others, a great democratic uprising. The nation is still reeling. That the rebellion pumped adrenalin into Ukip\u2019s veins is understandable. It scored a remarkable triumph. But its job is done. It should respect those who gave it victory, and go.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/nigel-farage-aide-says-ukip-supporters-have-flocked-to-tories\">Nigel Farage aide defects to Tories claiming a mass exodus from Ukip</a> </p> </aside>",

This is due to the fact that a very small proportion of their habitat will be potentially disturbed for a limited period of time.\u201d</p> <p>He said they had not referred the matter to the federal Department of the Environment and Energy because \u201cthe festival is not likely to have a significant environmental impact\u201d.</p> <p>He said there was strong evidence the animal\u2019s range in the NT was similar to what it was \u201cat the time of European settlement\u201d.</p>",

And it has gone into meltdown every time it has lost office.</p> <p>Lurches to the anti-capitalist left undermine its credibility and are then overcompensated for by lurches to the authoritarian right, leaving festering political wounds.</p> <p>Contrast this with the Liberal supremacy of the 19th century, which locked the Tories out of government for decades and fundamentally reformed the United Kingdom.</p> <p>When you add to its unreliable temperament the fact that Labour is a product of the industrial revolution, religious nonconformism and empire, it is hard to escape the conclusion that it really is out of place in 21st-century Britain, irreparably split between its socialist and trade unionist identities at a time when fewer and fewer people identify with either.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour always forgets how highly the British value competence and coherence in their political leaders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But I would go further and argue that Labour\u2019s continued existence is now actually frustrating the cause of progressive politics, in England especially.</p> <p>In its endless ideological wars, Labour always forgets how highly the British value competence and coherence in their political leaders. If presented with a disciplined Tory option, well to their right, and a leftwing shambles closer to their views, it seems many Brits will vote Tory. So we keep ending up with unrepresentatively rightwing governments. And by refusing to countenance electoral reform, Labour keeps the Tories in business as the default governing party in Britain.</p> <p>Somehow we have to break this pattern. Austerity and neoliberalism aren\u2019t working for Britain, or for continental Europe. But it is critical that we overcome the association in many voters\u2019 minds between smart fiscal interventionism and socialist recklessness.</p> <p>On the other hand, more central government control of the economy is unlikely to be the right idea for the information economy. But the thought of the Labour party embracing, for example, social entrepreneurialism, the circular economy or the digital revolution (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/19/john-mcdonnell-labour-technology-tax-economy-of-future\" title=\"\">\u201csocialism with an iPad\u201d</a>) is somewhat risible.</p> <p>Labour is now a party of flag-wavers, just as wedded to statism as ever: well meaning and socially engaged, for sure, but not problem-solvers. And I fear that by conflating \u201cKeynesianism\u201d with <em>Ch\u00e1vismo</em>, Corbyn\u2019s Labour is now undermining those of us seeking a hearing for left liberalism among a sceptical electorate.</p> <p>To be fair to them, though, you can see where the Corbynites are coming from. Labour professes to be a socialist party, and last year it elected a socialist leader. There is something going wrong when this can trigger such a violent reaction from its MPs. The left is very fond of pointing out contradictions. It should look in the mirror.</p> <p>So, rather than seek to undermine a leader with an anti-capitalist mandate, I decided that I would leave Labour and join the Liberal Democrats. On civil liberties and foreign policy especially, I never fitted in on the Labour right either. So there was nowhere left for a pretty uncomplicated social liberal such as myself to go.</p> <p>For sure, the task ahead for the Lib Dems is massive. But for mistakes over tuition fees to sink the political tradition of Mill, Gladstone, Lloyd George, Beveridge, Keynes, Grimond, Jenkins and Kennedy would be disastrous. And the fundamentals are with us. Young people are increasingly liberal, traditional class identifications are breaking down, and (under any leader) Labour is going to find it fantastically difficult to win a majority of seats in England.</p> <p>So electoral reform will probably be in its interests too <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/region/48.stm\" title=\"\">(remember, fewer than 1m votes separated the Labour and Lib Dem vote-share in England in 2010)</a>. With a more proportional electoral system in place, perhaps we will finally see that long-awaited realignment of the left at the same time, as we see the UK move towards federalism or break-up. But I am not going to wait around for that. British liberals need to be confident and coherent right now \u2013 not hide behind socialism. And I feel proud to be a signed-up member of the rehabilitation effort.</p>",

It will only improve with time and they will find things easier when Granit Xhaka is restored to the starting line-up. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger rested the Swiss international for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">the win over Southampton</a> and the trip to Paris, only bringing him off the bench with 19 minutes to play in the latter, and while it is a sensible move not to overexert a newcomer to the Premier League (perhaps Wenger has learned a thing or two about overplaying midfielders) he will presumably be restored to the team at Hull City. Xhaka was excellent in the away games at Leicester and Watford, and the thought occurs that it is exactly games like these \u2013 Premier League away matches where Arsenal have sometimes struggled for stability \u2013 where he will be needed the most. On paper there will be tougher assignments despite Hull\u2019s respectable start to the campaign, but if Xhaka can steer Arsenal quietly through this one he will have again done exactly what he was bought for. <strong>NA</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/ray-parlour-arsenal-wembley-tottenham-hard-lessons\">Ray Parlour: \u2018Arsenal got a few Champions League lessons at Wembley\u2019</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/13/same-old-arsenal-but-arsene-wengers-team-in-transition-earn-a-useful-point\">Barney Ronay: Same old Arsenal, but team earn useful point in Paris</a></li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-strikeforce-sadio-mane\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp: improving Liverpool\u2019s strikeforce was almost impossible</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3) Spurs to feel at home again with Sunderland visiting</h2> <p>Tottenham did a very good job of Spursifying Wembley on Wednesday night, plastering their livery on every available surface in the vicinity of the national stadium and hanging cockerel-bearing banners from every lamppost in the borough, but the fact remains that it wasn\u2019t <em>their</em> borough, and in the end <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/tottenham-hotspur-monaco-champions-league-group-e-match-report\">it was Monaco who took ownership</a> of the only part of town that actually mattered.

But it turns out that perhaps the biggest impact made by Pep Guardiola has been on his players\u2019 workload \u2013 last season Manchester City weren\u2019t even in the Premier League\u2019s top 10 hardest-working sides, ranked by the average distance covered by their players each game. This year they\u2019re at No2, just behind Liverpool (Bournemouth, last season\u2019s No2, are eighth). Kevin de Bruyne is City\u2019s top athlete, having covered 46km in his four matches so far (that put him sixth overall, with Burnley\u2019s George Boyd the overall leader on 49.6km). With his side playing more passes per match and enjoying more possession than any other, in the top three for total shots and pass accuracy and leading the league on goals scored and, of course, points won, perhaps Guardiola is aiming not just at victory but at total, across-the-board statistical domination. <strong>SB</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-fans-stop-champions-league-booing\">Pep Guardiola urges fans to stop Champions League booing</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/12/leicester-city-bournemouth-chase-udinese-midfielder-jakob-jankto\">Bournemouth and Leicester lead chase for Udinese\u2019s Jankto</a></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"623a5af2dffc12ad22cc7087da3b57851f1d2022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/623a5af2dffc12ad22cc7087da3b57851f1d2022/0_79_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola has had an immediate impact on his players as Manchester City manager.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola has had an immediate impact on his players as Manchester City manager.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) A familiar feeling for Manchester United fans<br></h2> <p>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s words after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/feyenoord-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report\">the dull Europa League defeat at Feyenoord</a> may have reminded you of someone. \u201cWe were just in control of the game and waiting for the possibility to win or not to win,\u201d he said of Manchester United\u2019s performance, adding that they were \u201cplaying at half-pace\u201d. United supporters have certainly become used to away reverses in Europe of late but Mourinho could more specifically have been describing any number of the games overseen during Louis van Gaal\u2019s tenure: control, but little in the way of dynamism or intent. It was a reminder that Mourinho\u2019s ideas will take time to translate themselves into action and suggested, too, that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/wayne-rooney-out-manchester-united-squad-feyenoord-europa-league\">absent Wayne Rooney</a> has not been the only encumbrance to United\u2019s attacking style. </p> <p>Paul Pogba is supposed to liven things up in the long run but Thursday saw his second sluggish performance of the week and United\u2019s other players cannot afford to wait for him to ignite. The predictable questions about his deployment have already been raised \u2013 the Manchester derby certainly passed Pogba by, to put it kindly, when he was paired deep with Marouane Fellaini \u2013 and looking through United\u2019s squad it is difficult to see a blend that you instinctively feel will click. They will win plenty of games under Mourinho but plenty of old habits have to be undone and no one should be too surprised if more bitter medicine is in store yet. A high-octane display at Watford, pointless at home so far, would be timely.<strong> NA</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/jose-mourinho-unhappy-offside-feyenoord-goal-manchester-united\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho says team deserved more after defeat to Feyenoord</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/sep/13/david-squires-on-the-manchester-derby-city-united\">David Squires on ... the Manchester derby</a></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Football Weekly Extra\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/283034279&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe> <figcaption>Football Weekly Extra: Leicester batter Brugge and Celtic collapse in Barcelona</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Barkley\u2019s place in danger at in-form Everton<br></h2> <p>Those who watched Everton\u2019s game at Sunderland on Monday on Sky would have witnessed a particularly punishing moment of pundit-humbling. Jamie Carragher and Phil Neville spent much of the build-up to the game eulogising the ability of Ross Barkley, who proceeded to play poorly for 45 minutes before being substituted at half-time. Barkley may have been left out of Sam Allardyce\u2019s England squad but he had played all but six minutes of Everton\u2019s three previous league games this season, and started all but two of their top-flight matches last season (coincidentally he was also substituted at half-time the last time they visited Sunderland, last May). Now his place in the Everton team is in genuine peril, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/ross-barkley-must-raise-game-everton-ronald-koeman\">with Koeman publicly criticising his performance</a> both at the Stadium of Light and again in Thursday\u2019s press conference looking forward to the game against Middlesbrough. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/player/card/competition/attack/415799/8/100\"> <div data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"player-card player-card--football\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div class=\"player-card__image-container\"> <img class=\"player-card__image\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://sport.guim.co.uk/football/player-images/100/415799.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Ross Barkley\"> </div> <div class=\"player-card__player\"> <div class=\"player-card__position\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Midfielder</div> <div class=\"player-card__name\" itemprop=\"name\">Ross Barkley</div> </div> <dl class=\"player-card__stats\"> <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Appearances</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">4</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Goals</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">1</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">10</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots on target</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">40%</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Offsides</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">2</dd> </dl> </div> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was a reason to change him, he lost many balls,\u201d Koeman said on the latter occasion. \u201cWe showed [him] the clips, and there is no escape.\u201d Of his chances of starting this match, he said only that \u201che needs to improve, but we will see at the weekend\u201d.

  "<p>Confronting photos of the bruised and swollen body of the Chinese actor Xu Ting widely circulated after her death have been used to highlight the dangers of using traditional Chinese therapies over conventional medicine for treating cancer.</p> <p>In July Xu, 25, announced on the Chinese social media website Weibo she had lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system that best responds to chemotherapy as a first-line treatment. </p> <p>However, Xu said the high cost of chemotherapy in China and her fears about side effects and pain meant she had decided to treat her cancer with a mix of Chinese therapies instead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/27/anti-pollution-tech-china-air-purifiers-dirty-air\">China's anti-pollution tech is going premium, but it can't make dirty air go away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo matter how long I live, I want to enjoy every day happily,\u201d she wrote, adding that she did not want to \u201clet chemotherapy torment me to the point where there\u2019s no beauty and talent left\u201d. The actress appeared on television in the series Dad Home and acted in the comedy Lost In Macau.</p> <p>Later in July, Xu posted photos to Weibo of the aftermath of some of the alternative treatments she had undergone, including acupuncture and cupping, which involves placing a flammable substance into a cup, typically a cotton bud, and setting it on fire. As the fire goes out, the cup is placed upside down on the skin, usually the back, creating a vacuum and leaving welts on the body. </p> <p>Some users begged her to seek chemotherapy. One user wrote on her Weibo page: \u201cYou need to rely on modern medicine to save yourself.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9911069561102121\">American Cancer Society guide</a> to complementary and alternative therapies warns of the risk of burns from cupping and states that \u201cavailable scientific evidence does not support claims that cupping has any health benefits\u201d.</p> <p>Along with cupping, used by the swimmer Michael Phelps, Xu also turned to gua sha, a treatment that involves scraping the skin with a tool, and which is practised by the actor Gwyneth Paltrow. It left Xu with red marks and bruising down her neck.</p> <p>\u201cFrankly, traditional Chinese medicine is also painful,\u201d Xu wrote as a caption underneath one of the images of the treatment she posted to her blog. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637152\">a study</a> published in the journal Complementary Therapies in Medicine, gua sha users in Hong Kong tended to use it mostly to treat respiratory and pain problems.</p> <p>In August, Xu\u2019s sister encouraged her to undergo chemotherapy as she became more unwell. Xu died on 7 September, shortly after starting chemotherapy. </p> <p>Her death has sparked a debate in the Chinese media about the use and effectiveness of Chinese therapies. On the Chinese news website <a href=\"http://health.people.com.cn/n1/2016/0914/c398004-28715926.html\">people.cn</a>, the head of the traditional Chinese medicine department at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing, Dr Feng Li, <a href=\"http://health.people.com.cn/n1/2016/0914/c398004-28715926.html\">wrote that</a> Chinese therapies should not be blamed for Xu\u2019s death.</p> <p>He wrote that \u201cwhile western approaches like radiology, chemotherapy, and surgery are effective in shrinking the tumour\u201d, Chinese therapies were \u201ceffective in reducing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and pain that comes with western treatment\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cMoreover, after the tumour is under control, traditional Chinese medicine helps to repair the immune system, accelerate the body\u2019s recovery and minimise the chance of the tumour returning.\u201d </p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003746/\">2014 review</a> of complementary and alternative medicine for cancer pain found alternative treatments, including Chinese treatments, had \u201clow or moderate\u201d evidence for alleviating cancer pain.</p> <p>But a peer-reviewed paper published in the journal Cancer and Oncology Pain described the barriers some people faced obtaining conventional medical treatment.

Two decades ago we\u2019d all witnessed the damage words by this same public figure sought to do to people, to whole communities, to a nation.

But the uncomfortable fact is that Pauline Hanson does have power; she was elected into the parliament, not through preferences but in her own right.</p> <p>Senator Hanson has received unprecedented levels of coverage of her racist views, even as a paid commentator by network news. To suggest she could just be allowed to preach hate and fade into the background is ludicrous. And to suggest the Greens elevated the coverage of her second maiden speech is similarly so. The coverage would have been those hateful words beamed into living rooms and personal devices across the globe but with no strong counter message that this is not Australia.</p> <p>The 45th Parliament risks being the most divisive parliament in Australia\u2019s history but it doesn\u2019t have to be.

But the UK Anti-Doping Agency on Thursday admitted that the hackers had gained access to the private medical records of 53 British athletes when it used a phishing email to break illegally into Wada\u2019s anti-doping administration and management system (Adams).</p> <p>Ukad\u2019s chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, said she was \u201cincredibly concerned and disappointed\u201d by the invasion of privacy, adding that she found it \u201cincredibly distressing\u201d. A Ukad spokesperson confirmed those affected were either on TUEs when they competed at the Rio Olympics or had previously been granted them.</p> <p>The BOA admitted it was \u201cconcerned\u201d at the development but stressed it had full confidence in its athletes. A BOA spokesperson said: \u201cWe are naturally concerned that private and personal data has been accessed and are working closely with UK Anti-Doping and our sports and to clarify the facts of this matter on behalf of all Team GB athletes. We remain confident of our athlete community and their commitment to clean sport.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/chris-froome-defends-use-tues-wada-hacking-leaks\" title=\"\">Froome and Wiggins had defended their use of TUEs</a>, with Froome saying he had \u201cno issues\u201d with the leaks, pointing out he has spoken publicly about being granted them before. The 31-year-old told the Scotsman newspaper this summer that he had used TUEs twice during his career, in 2013 and 2014.</p> <p>He said in a statement: \u201cI\u2019ve openly discussed my TUEs with the media and have no issues with the leak which confirms my statements. In nine years as a professional I\u2019ve twice required a TUE for exacerbated asthma; the last time was in 2014.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Wiggins, meanwhile, was also dismissive of the leak saying: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new here. Everyone knows Brad suffers from asthma, his medical treatment is British Cycling and International Cycling Union approved and like all Team GB athletes he follows Wada regulations to the letter. The leak of these records is an attempt to undermine the credibility of Wada and that\u2019s something for them to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>A British Cycling spokesman followed suit, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our strong anti-doping culture at British Cycling. As the national governing body for the sport in Britain and a supporter of the Wada code, we condemn the publication of any individual\u2019s medical information without their permission.\u201d</p> <p>The golfer Charley Hull, the rower Sam Townsend and the rugby union player Heather Fisher were also included in the second batch of athletes whose details were made public on Wednesday night by Fancy Bears.

Swart specifically highlighted the use of cortisone out of competition, especially in cycling to lose weight without losing power, as well as thyroid medication use by runners to control appetite \u2013 both of which remain legal despite their apparent benefits.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that cyclists are using corticosteroids in training,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are also used for treating injuries but I don\u2019t think it would be an overwhelming burden if the door was closed on abusing corticosteroids for performance by extending the requirement of TUEs to out of competition.</p> <p>\u201cThyroid hormone is also not on the prohibited list but it maybe used to reduce weight and control appetite.

  "<p>Ann Patchett\u2019s seventh novel begins in the early 1960s, at Beverly and Fix Keating\u2019s christening party for their daughter Franny. An unexpected guest turns up, with a large bottle of gin in lieu of an invitation. Bert Cousins is a lawyer in the Los Angeles district attorney\u2019s office; Fix Keating is a local cop. They barely know each other, but Bert wants an excuse to escape a home with three small children and a pregnant wife. With the help of Bert\u2019s gin, everyone gets drunk and many lives are changed. Handsome Bert kisses beautiful Beverly, sparking an affair that splits and reconfigures their families. Eventually Bert and Beverly leave their spouses, marry and move to Virginia, where their six children come together each summer.</p> <p><em>Commonwealth</em> crosscuts between the lives of the Keating and Cousins families over the next five decades, as tragedy strikes and life unfolds. In her 20s, Franny Keating begins a relationship with the renowned novelist Leon Posen, a much older man in desperate need of inspiration for a new book. The stories she tells him of her childhood sow the seeds for his bestselling comeback, also entitled \u201cCommonwealth\u201d. The impact of that novel, and the secrets it reveals, spin the threads Patchett uses to stitch together the stories of 10 people: the six Keating-Cousins children and their four parents.</p> <p>All of this will make <em>Commonwealth</em> sound like a domestic novel, and it is \u2013 one of the finest in recent memory, which is reason enough to admire it. But the word \u201ccommonwealth\u201d also flies like a flag over this book, suggesting a broader field of vision. The story primarily shifts between California, the state that most symbolises the American dream, and Virginia, one of America\u2019s four designated \u201ccommonwealth\u201d states. America\u2019s various founding narratives often invoke the idea of commonwealth; in Virginia, the word is used to suggest the state\u2019s autonomous and original national role, its prehistory as the earliest colony. Virginia was the home of both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, and thus also the birthplace of the declaration of independence; it is as symbolic as Massachusetts (by no coincidence another commonwealth). But America itself is also a commonwealth: a republic in which everyone has a collective interest, and an equal voice. So \u201ccommonwealth\u201d is a loaded, even paradoxical term in the United States, one that might variously denote sharing prosperity, mutual greed or serving the greater good; unity with the body politic or autonomy from it. Independence or collectivity: the great question America never answers.</p> <p>Although it is uneasily united, often divisive and rancorous, the newly formed Keating-Cousins family never reduces to mere national allegory, however. Part of Patchett\u2019s design is to curve every type, bend every cliche, adulterate every formula. (One of her slyest turns is to plant a gun in the novel in bold defiance of Chekhov\u2019s famous axiom, insinuating that a \u201ccommonwealth\u201d might appear to hinge on guns and actually be about something else entirely.) The youngest of the six children, Albie Cousins, appears early on to be emerging as a familiar version of a fictional troubled teen, who nearly burned down the high school as a teenager, and whose adult life is shrouded in the kind of dubious mystery that seems always to veil adults in novels who are estranged from their families. For much of the story the other characters don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to him, but they\u2019re sure it isn\u2019t good. Patchett tempts the reader into concluding that Albie was born bad, and this will be the tale of a child sociopath, a novel asking whether evil is intractable.</p> <p>But she is up to something far more subtle, startling and painful than that. There is nothing inevitable or fated here, unless it is that actions have consequences, most of which are unintended. A person might seem \u201cunbearable\u201d, but then the narrating mind suggests, \u201cmaybe that\u2019s the real problem\u201d, that a person who seems unbearable may rather be \u201cemblematic of what can never be overcome\u201d. When the whole tragic power of her story hits the reader, about two-thirds of the way through, the effect is physically breathtaking. Patchett sucker-punches you, but leaves you feeling you had it coming \u2013 whether for underestimating her, or her characters, or humanity, is hard to say.</p> <p>In particular, <em>Commonwealth</em> is one of the most discerning novels about siblings I can recall. One pair of stepsiblings share an equivocal bond: \u201cIn that sense the two of them had been a team, albeit a team neither one of them wanted to be on.\u201d Sisters Franny and Caroline fought all the way through childhood, with real bitterness. In a more conventional story, that rancour would follow them, and they would end distant, estranged adults. In <em>Commonwealth</em>, they grow out of it, finding a deep bond in their shared past, a common understanding of their complicated family that no one else grasps. When their father\u2019s second wife criticises a choice they made, Caroline reassures her sister that even if it makes no sense to other people, she knows they did the right thing. A grateful Franny asks: \u201cWhat do the only children do?\u201d to which Caroline responds: \u201cWe\u2019ll never have to know.\u201d</p> <p>The novel is alive with provocative insights that sum up entire relationships: \u201cHis daughter from his first marriage always needed money because she needed so much more than money but money was the easiest way for her to express those needs.\u201d That sentence perfectly sums up her technique: it begins with a disagreeable type and ends with wise and generous sympathy for a human being. There are no lazy shortcuts. The neighbourhood in Los Angeles where the story begins, for example, has not, as one might have predicted, taken a downturn in recent years: \u201cIn truth, the story didn\u2019t turn out to be such a bad one,\u201d the narrator observes of the neighbourhood; by implication, the same applies to Patchett\u2019s entire tale. No one in it is worthless.</p> <p>The commonwealth of this novel is family, it is nation, it is history shared and history lost. Late in the novel, Franny and Caroline travel with their father to see Teresa Cousins, Bert\u2019s first wife. Former cop Fix Keating, expert in the streets of LA, directs them through a back route to their old neighbourhood, Torrance. \u201cAll the stories go with you, Franny thought, closing her eyes.

  "<p>Screaming sirens, overcrowding, traffic; life in the city isn\u2019t always relaxing.</p> <p>These stressors aren\u2019t simply inconvenient or irritating, though; research has suggested that urban living has a significant impact on mental health. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gwern.net/docs/nature/2010-peen.pdf\">One meta-analysis</a> found that those living in cities were 21% more likely to experience an anxiety disorder \u2013 mood disorders were even higher, at 39%. People who grew up in a city are twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as those who grew up in the countryside, with a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16150958\">2005 study</a> suggesting this link may even be causal. </p> <p>Urban stressors appear to have a biological impact, too. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jun/22/city-living-afffects-brain\">2011 study</a> from the Central Institute of Mental Health at the University of Heidelberg found that city living was associated with greater stress responses in both the amygdala and the cingulate cortex \u2013 areas linked to emotional regulation, depression and anxiety. This increased activation, the research team said, could have a \u201clasting effect\u201d, both on the brain\u2019s development and its ongoing susceptibility to mental illness.</p> <p>The studies are part of a wider field of environmental psychology that seeks to understand how individuals interact with their environments, and how those environments can affect our social lives, relationships and even our mental health. </p> <p>The issue is hotly debated. For example, it\u2019s often believed that open plan offices promote pro-social working and avoid the drab monotony of cubicle working, but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2014/sep/29/open-plan-office-health-productivity\">other studies</a> claim that it can instead be bad for productivity and wellbeing. </p> <p>Co-housing is often promoted as a way of encouraging community spirit. Many people who live in these communities \u2013 usually private bedrooms with communal kitchens or social areas and shared maintenance responsibility \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/21/how-to-create-happy-communities-through-co-housing\">have reported increased happiness</a> and connection with other residents. But <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ala-apa.org/newsletter/2006/10/17/the-good-and-the-bad-of-cohousing/\">other studies</a> have stressed that tenants can lose their sense of individualism and privacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5db65daa3618f840eae8c828c798a6bfa599dd0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5db65daa3618f840eae8c828c798a6bfa599dd0b/0_85_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lilac Grove in Leeds co-housing project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lilac Grove in Leeds, a co-housing project built on the site of a former school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Layla McCay, director of the Centre for Urban Design and Mental Health, says these debates are complex and dependent on a number of nuanced factors. The think tank was set up to encourage more rigorous evaluation on the way we design our cities, and what impact it can have on mental wellbeing. She isolates several elements that she believes have a positive influence: access to nature or green spaces, the design of public spaces that facilitate physical activity and encourage social interaction, and living and working in spaces that feel safe. </p> <p>But what about particular kinds of buildings? Brutalist structures like the Barbican estate in London are not always considered to be so positive for mental health, with many condemning brutalism\u2019s <a href=\"https://theawl.com/the-ugly-beauty-of-brutalism-41ae4f80a683\">depressing aesthetic</a>. Yet despite some calling it <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3126946.stm\">London\u2019s \u201cugliest building\u201d</a>, the Barbican is a perfect example of the positive attributes outlined by McCay. Full of greenery, lakes and balconies, the estate also gives pedestrians priority over cars and features mini town squares where residents can socialise, work and relax.</p> <p>The estate is well lit and designed with good sight lines, meaning residents feel safe \u2013 a huge factor in their mental wellbeing. But this can be a difficult line to tread. Though well-lit areas are generally considered to reduce stress by increasing feelings of safety, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/may/19/darkness-luxury-britains-council-estates-lighting-cctv\">it has been argued</a> that darkness is a luxury not afforded to those living in council housing. If you live in an estate where bright lights shine in your window, you may lose sleep or feel exposed and surveilled; darkness, on the other hand, can be more subtly landscaped to provide a sense of value, safety and beauty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c43b5293936e5931b7500215edc15343de411d34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c43b5293936e5931b7500215edc15343de411d34/0_144_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abandoned shops in north Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It has been suggested that abandoned shops can make people more anxious.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if a so-called ugly building can still be positive for mental health, what role does beauty and aesthetic have to play? Despite beauty being a subjective term, <a href=\"http://www.urbandesignmentalhealth.com/journal1-beautifulplacesandwellbeing.html\">recent research has found</a> that \u201cinhabitants of more scenic environments report better health\u201d, but again this often comes back to the presence of nature. Indeed, neglected environments can contribute to mental ill-health \u2013 dilapidated neighbourhoods and abandoned shops or houses can make us feel unsafe, with run-down environments <a href=\"http://www.sprawlwatch.org/health.pdf\">found</a> to contribute to anxiety and persistent low mood.</p> <p>Though high-rise housing was initially commended for its views, larger rooms, sense of \u201curban privacy\u201d and efficient use of concrete, it was later suggested that the designs gave rise to various social and mental ills: increased crime, suicide rates and behavioural problems. High-floor dwellers were most at risk when it came to the negative impacts of such living environments because they were apparently most likely to isolate themselves. Such buildings were roundly condemned by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jgballard\">JG Ballard</a>, who felt that the \u201crapid turnover of acquaintances, the lack of involvement with others, and the total self-sufficiency of lives\u201d he saw in high-rises would allow \u201cthe psychotics\u201d to take over. </p> <p>Though Ballard\u2019s doom-laden vision of high-rise living may seem compelling \u2013 especially considering the anti-social reputation of such estates \u2013 more recent research suggests that the buildings are not as intrinsically flawed as we might first imagine. Rather, the social ills found in such environments may be more closely related to poor maintenance than anything innate. Reports have <a href=\"http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/461-480/tandi476.html\">found</a> that \u201crisky\u201d facilities such as broken lights and windows, litter, graffiti and non-functioning CCTV may have more to do with increased crime rates \u2013 and anxiety-inducing fear of crime \u2013 than the physical environment itself. So mental ill-health may increase once the physical environment has deteriorated. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907a7faa78b06f31dad8fbe0aa578273713ebac1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907a7faa78b06f31dad8fbe0aa578273713ebac1/0_94_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Costanera Center shopping mall, Santiago de Chile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If shopping malls are well maintained and safe, they could have a positive impact on mental health.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felipe Trueba/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">Southwark\u2019s Heygate Estate</a> had a reputation for crime, despite crime rates that were <a href=\"http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateCrimeStats.pdf\">half the average for the borough</a>. Southwark council\u2019s director of regeneration <a href=\"https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=urban-regional-planning;6d774927.00\">claimed in 1999</a> that \u201csocial housing generates people on low incomes coming in, which generates poor school performances, and middle class people stay away\u201d. With attitudes like this, is it any surprise that tenants felt isolated and abandoned?</p> <p>Shopping centres also appear to refute the physical determinism of much environmental psychology. Often considered to be vast, unhealthy behemoths designed to disorient and dazzle us into spending money we don\u2019t have, shopping malls could, in fact, be beneficial to individual and societal wellbeing. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301595098_The_restorative_potential_of_shopping_malls\">One team of researchers</a> argues shopping centres may possess \u201cmentally restorative qualities\u201d that could rival even natural settings. Again it suggests that healthy factors \u2013 greenery, a focus on safety, good maintenance, a sense of openness \u2013 could significantly reduce stress, no matter how buildings themselves are designed or interpreted.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t always the case; privatised public spaces like shopping malls often limit activity and use design to control behaviour. Though these spaces may feel and seem as if they are public, they are privately owned, meaning that our rights and behaviours are constricted and controlled. This in turn can contribute to a sense of anxiety.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6bd9943077b7f80302d7c334b448c2a1053885eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bd9943077b7f80302d7c334b448c2a1053885eb/0_150_2000_3804/526.jpg\" alt=\"Sky City in Changsha\" width=\"526\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Would living \u2018Sky City\u2019 in Changsha feel claustrophobic?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Feature China/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What about buildings that claim to be cities in themselves? In China, the proposed development of a \u201cSky City\u201d \u2013 which was supposed to combine natural green spaces with homes, hotels, offices, shops, schools and a hospital in one building \u2013<strong> </strong>was an attempt to create a living environment that both encourages tenant wellbeing as well as improving sustainability and providing efficient use of space. Gensler\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/23/inside-shanghai-tower-china-tallest-building-green-skyscrapers\">Shanghai Tower</a>, which is set to open to the public soon, has incorporated restaurants, shops, homes, offices and even parks inside a consciously pro-social spiral glass shell. Visiting a park two floors down from your flat might sound convenient, but can it really replace the health benefits of a stroll in a natural green space? Going to school in the same building you live in could save time, but it also sounds like a limiting, claustrophobic and homogenous experience.</p> <p>In terms of workspaces, McCay describes Coca Cola\u2019s new Tokyo headquarters, designed by Japanese architectural firm JMA, as an impressive example of design that combines good architecture with mindfully positive environmental features. The company has established bike parking so that employees cycle rather than drive to work, the building is full of natural light, and co-working spaces have replaced traditional cube-style office working spaces. </p> <p>Ongoing debates aside, physical environment can only determine so much. Biological and social factors are still major drivers of mental ill-health, whether clinical or not. </p> <p>\u201cGenetics, early experiences, family relationships and social settings can\u2019t be addressed through urban design,\u201d McCay explains. \u201cBut urban design can and should play a role, just as it does for physical disorders, which have equally complex causes.\u201d</p> <p>Increasingly, buildings and public spaces are being designed \u2013 or at the very least, critically analysed \u2013 with mental wellbeing in mind. A small number of collectives and centres have been established to examine the ways urban spaces intersect with mental health, and architects and policymakers are slowly becoming more mindful of the ways their projects impact on the health and happiness of city-dwellers. </p> <p>With anti-stigma campaigns and increased media visibility bringing mental health to the forefront of the cultural landscape, there\u2019s a clear case for policymakers to take it into consideration when designing public spaces. But experts believe guidelines for healthy urban environments are currently failing to take this growing awareness into consideration. Alan Penn, dean of the Bartlett faculty of the built environment at University College London, believes that policymakers and architects are not dealing with mental health sufficiently because \u201cunderstanding of these issues is not yet mainstream\u201d in the architectural community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/08/where-world-most-stressful-city-urban-life-depression-anxiety\">Where is the world's most stressful city?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McCay is optimistic, and believes that opportunities to improve mental health will become \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, and \u201can expected component of the value of any design for buildings and public spaces\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDesigning spaces to promote good mental health \u2013 and to support people with mental health problems \u2013 is an integral part of building a sustainable city,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cGood mental health can improve our enjoyment of life, our coping skills and relationships, our educational achievement, employment, housing and economic potential, help reduce physical health problems, ease the demand for healthcare and social care, build social capital, decrease suicides; and help people to live together in a positive, productive, cost-effective and ultimately happy way.

So striving for the healthiest city crown is still an ongoing process in Copenhagen, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/05/where-world-most-cycle-friendly-city-amsterdam-copenhagen\">50% of city-centre trips</a> are already made by bike, 96% of citizens are able to walk to parks or beaches in less than 15 minutes, and <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.dk/20160524/copenhagen-touts-organic-food-revolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">88% of all public institutions</a> are dishing up organic food.</p> <p>This continued effort is not simply the responsibility of the city\u2019s public health officials, but is shared across the whole municipal administration. </p> <p>Monica Keaney and Esben Aslund-Lanth\u00e9n, research analysts at thinktank <a href=\"http://sustainia.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sustainia</a>, say badly planned urban landscapes are polluted, tend to discourage physical activity and promote unhealthy food consumption.

But the mayor can\u2019t do it alone - partnerships are vital.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn order for health to really work, you have to make partnerships with civil society, private workplaces and individuals\u201d, explains Thomsen. \u201cBut we also have to think health policy into other parts of the municipality.\u201d One example is the way the mayor\u2019s office is working with the technical and environmental administration responsible for the city\u2019s leading cycling infrastructure. The two teams are working together to make riding a bike the easy option, not just the healthy one, through widening paths and promoting active transport.<br></p> <p>The same can be said for the education administration, with whom Thomsen is working to bring sexual and mental health courses and other youth-focused initiatives into schools, to embed a healthy lifestyle balance into school life, rather than making it an additional responsibility for educators. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/sep/02/app-oslo-children-traffic-road-safety\">The app that gives Oslo's children a direct say over their own road safety</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But one of the most important partnerships for the Copenhagen municipality is with its citizens. \u201cIn order to get equal opportunities, you have to treat people differently\u201d, says Thomsen. \u201cInvolvement at an individual level is very important\u201d.<br></p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.kk.dk/sites/default/files/edoc/0e147196-7f69-4b1d-88d8-3c22a49b677c/ccb83816-ce5f-44f7-a825-1324f9e18b6f/Attachments/14223678-16474820-1.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">2015 research from the University of Copenhagen</a> (pdf), citizens with a non-Danish background are at higher risk of developing lifestyle diseases such as diabetes.

Across the city, 16 different courses are led in mosques, women\u2019s centres and recreation halls, with themes chosen by the leaders, based on how relevant they are to their own community. The topics range from puberty and sexual health, to slimming tips and how to stay healthy during Ramadan.<br></p> <p>A similar peer-to-peer project for the male population is also underway, seeking to build bridges between citizens and the municipality, as men are typically less likely to use the city\u2019s health services. But rather than mosques and recreation centres, the <a href=\"http://sundhed.kk.dk/artikel/m%C3%A6nd-i-k%C3%B8benhavn\" rel=\"nofollow\">men in Copenhagen</a> initiative reaches out to people in pubs, on the streets and in job centres, with a goal to promote a healthier lifestyle for 200 men through social activities, cooking classes and sports events.<br></p> <p>Previously, Copenhagen\u2019s policies have focused primarily on physical health \u2013 the idea that healthy eating and regular exercise will solve your problems. But in the latest strategy, equal weight is being given to mental health.

Yes I feel more exposed, more of a target, but I also have links with activists and groups outside Uganda that I can call if someone threatens me. </p> <p>I have suffered harassment throughout my life, including from my in-laws from my first marriage.

FAAARK!

He recites poetry. He studs his words with declarations of wonder. \u201cWow! Isn\u2019t that fantastic?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an exuberant performance, and one Olsen has been running all week. His latest exhibition, a 70-year retrospective of his distinguished painting career, opened at the National Gallery of Victoria on Friday. </p> <p>It is the largest exhibition of his career and features pottery and journals as well as a collection of his best-known works, the oldest painted in 1952 and the latest completed just two months ago.</p> <p>When curator David Hurlston opens the exhibition for a preview on Wednesday, Olsen, palette in hand, is putting the final touches on a mural at the entrance. He feigns shock when the photographers rush toward him and then poses happily for the camera, explaining his steps. \u201cI want to know how the landscape writes itself,\u201d he says, before adopting a singsong voice. \u201cThere\u2019s marvellous pictures that have been done, foreground, middle distance, background, tralalalala ...

He rose to prominence in the Sydney art scene of the 1960s and remains a product of that era: optimistic, irreverent and slightly problematic \u2013 particularly when reckoning with Australia\u2019s colonial past.</p> <p>The first hint of this in his media appearances this week came on Tuesday night when, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/john-olsen's-world/7839548\">in conversation with Radio National\u2019s Phillip Adams</a>, he spoke about the vibrancy he felt upon returning to Sydney in 1960 after years spent working in post-civil war Spain.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the you beaut country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a country that has never had a civil war, and war has not been known in Australia.\u201d</p> <p>Australians, he said, were \u201ca new people in a very old country\u201d with a continent \u201clargely undiscovered\u201d.</p> <p>Adams later objected: the frontier wars, between colonialists and Indigenous peoples, ran long and bloody. Australia has too many places named Slaughterhouse Creek to be considered untouched by war.</p> <p>But public recognition of that conflict is fairly recent. Peaceful settlement was the established truth until the 1992 Mabo decision, in which the high court found Australia had never been Terra nullius, and that paths trodden by white explorers such as Burke and Wills had been trudged thousands of times before.</p> <p>Olsen is fascinated by exploration, by crossing the frontier. To be an artist, he says, \u201cis to be an explorer.\u201d </p> <p>It is what drove him to paint landscapes in the Australian outback, in the Kimberley, far-north Queensland, and of course the famous series on Lake Eyre. He is rightly applauded as the first mainstream artist to paint those scenes, but to talk in those terms today  has a feeling of cultural erasure. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fc0b7c0e5a406f91e8d4297dadaea65adc82adcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc0b7c0e5a406f91e8d4297dadaea65adc82adcf/0_0_2769_3000/923.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Eyre (1975) by John Olsen\" width=\"923\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Can you believe that this huge salt lake has never been painted before?\u2019: Lake Eyre (1975) by John Olsen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Olsen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLake Eyre, now this is one of the extraordinary things that can happen in Australian art \u2013 can you believe that this huge salt lake has never been painted before?\u201d Olsen says, shortly before delivering his impression of a foul-mouthed crow. \u201cI mean just the sheer privilege to say this is marvellous.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Australians, he tells the delighted crowd, are saucer-dwellers, living on the edges of the great continent and ignoring all the interesting bits in the middle. Lake Eyre \u2013 a vast salt-pan 15m below sea-level in the South Australian outback that stands empty and inhospitable for years at a time, until the continent gets enough rain to make the rivers run backwards and fill it up \u2013 is the very middle of the middle.</p> <p>\u201cEmptiness is as full as fullness,\u201d Olsen says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the richness of emptiness which for some reason was known as the dead heart. FAAARRK! That\u2019s a lie! That\u2019s not true! It\u2019s teeming with life. And this kind of thing is an exciting thing. To be an Australian artist is to be an explorer.\u201d</p> <p>There is a wandering quality to Olsen\u2019s landscapes, which he says are intended to take the viewer on a journey. The landscape is written, he says, rather than painted. He is scathing of traditional landscape works, saying Australia should be viewed from the air and in the dry, when everything is a yellow-brown that seems dull and lifeless to the European eye.</p> <p>It\u2019s an obvious parallel to some Indigenous art, in which the landscape is painted from above and used to tell a story, a dreaming.</p> <p>Olsen says the similarity was the result of a convergence rather than direct influence.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t influenced by Aboriginal art \u2026 one can like, but not be influenced,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s not to be forgotten that Aboriginal art is totemic or else journeys to the dreamtime. Now, we can\u2019t possibly get near that and neither should we because it\u2019s impossible to have that same kind of feeling of the land.\u201d</p> <p>His artworks were different, he says, because he did not claim the same connection to the land, and because they were informed by \u201ca western understanding of art\u201d.</p> <p>There was no Indigenous art in museums when Olsen was a student in Sydney in the late 1940s, but he and his friends admired it, when they could find it.<br></p> <p>\u201cPicasso thought the best art that had come out of Australia was Aboriginal art,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it is \u2013 it\u2019s very, very good \u2013 but there are absences in it that needed to be sort of discovered. Like, for example, in Aboriginal art there is no light.\u201d</p> <p>Light in Australian art, he says, came from the Heidelberg School, the late 19th century Australian impressionist movement.</p> <p>Olsen studied art at the Datillo Rubbo Art School in the late 1940s and then the Julian Ashton School in Sydney in the early 1950s. It was a traditional training that included the traditional art student\u2019s right of passage: protesting against the tastes of the establishment. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e7cf53cf17d5b8709a156e949ce5fca583ff967\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e7cf53cf17d5b8709a156e949ce5fca583ff967/0_0_3000_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Olsen\u2019s 2005 Archibald Prize-winning painting, Self Portrait: Janus Faced\" width=\"1000\" height=\"911\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Olsen\u2019s 2005 Archibald Prize-winning painting, Self Portrait: Janus Faced</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Olsen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his case, the target was the board of trustees for the Art Gallery of New South Wales, which he and his peers felt had made the dull choice of William Dargie as winner of the Archibald prize too many times.

  "<p>Uber is in the middle of a bruising battle for dominance in east Africa\u2019s largest economy: Kenya. The ride-hailing company started operating in the cities of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and Thika last year.<br></p> <p>It has already outlasted the online cab operator Easy Taxi, which opted out of the Kenyan market in May this year following a decision by one of its backers, Goldman Sachs, to direct all its investments towards the more profitable Uber.</p> <p>However, Uber now has a new domestic rival: Safaricom. It\u2019s one of Kenya\u2019s largest companies, 40% owned by Vodafone, with $380m (\u00a3265m) profits in 2015. Its own taxi-hailing brand <a href=\"http://little.co.ke/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Little Cab</a>, developed in partnership with Kenyan software company <a href=\"http://www.craftsilicon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Craft Silicon</a>, launched in July with a pricing system significantly cheaper than Uber. </p> <p>In response, Uber slashed its taxi fare prices by 35% in August. For the drivers, Little Cab currently takes a 15% commission off the taxi fare, while Uber takes 25% commission.</p> <p>For Kenyans, the battle for dominance brings the prospect of cheaper, easier to organise and more reliable transport by taxi, but it is unclear whether it will solve its capital Nairobi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/events/ke/en/ted-outthink-urban.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">costly congestion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/10/no-escape-nairobi-air-pollution-sparks-africa-health-warning\">\u201cmind-boggling\u201d</a> air pollution.</p> <p>Rather than encouraging more car use, Uber has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/22/uber-grab-malaysia-kuala-lumpur-congestion-crisis-car-sharing\">argued in the past</a> that it doesn\u2019t compete with public transport. It says many people use ride-hailing companies to travel from a bus or train station. It has also argued that they drive down car ownership by making the taxi system cheap and convenient. </p> <h2>Ride-hailing growth</h2> <p>Nairobi takes pride in calling itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/kenya-silicon-savannah-digital-technology\">Africa\u2019s Silicon Valley</a>. Numerous tech startups and a high smartphone use and internet penetration rate have led to the growth of a thriving IT sector.<br></p> <p>More than 30 million people in Kenya now have mobile phones, with just <a href=\"http://www.ca.go.ke/index.php/what-we-do/94-news/285-kenya-s-mobile-penetration-hits-80-per-cent\" rel=\"nofollow\">under 15 million</a> having access to mobile data/internet. It is this growth, in part, that has attracted numerous internet companies to set up shop in the country, including Uber and now Little Cab.</p> <p>The competition between ride-hailing companies has been welcomed by consumer bodies and residents in Nairobi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d32a7bd13b6cc8d3d2dfb36f8ecb42f19e336b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d32a7bd13b6cc8d3d2dfb36f8ecb42f19e336b3/0_397_5136_3083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Congestion in Nairobi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nairobi loses $600,000 a day in lost economic growth as a result of congestion on the roads, according to <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/events/ke/en/ted-outthink-urban.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">IBM Research</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCompetition is good for the consumer. Already we have seen price cuts and the two companies will be forced to be innovative to maintain their grip,\u201d says Stephen Mutoro, the chief executive of the country\u2019s largest consumer rights body, Consumers Federation of Kenya. \u201cBetter days lie ahead for the commuter.\u201d</p> <p>Magdalene Anyango, an advertising executive in Nairobi, says the arrival of both companies has helped cut her travel costs and made them more transparent. \u201cFirst, whenever I hail a taxi I know exactly how far they are from my location. I know what I will be charged and I can get one at any time,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>Kenya\u2019s transport sector is generally characterised by chaos. Charges for cab rides are unpredictable and can depend on weather, traffic or the general mood of the provider.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no way of telling what your cab guy would charge you. One day you\u2019d pay $15, the next day you\u2019d pay $30 over the same distance just because you needed to catch a flight at 3am,\u201d says Anyango. \u201cAlso, it eliminates employee fraud. An employer can\u2019t use an Uber or Little and falsify the claims. We get an e-invoice whenever any of our employees use the service.\u201d</p> <p>Other taxi operators in Nairobi have been less welcoming to Uber and Little Cab. In March this year, an Uber taxi was burned in Nairobi. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/22/uber-grab-malaysia-kuala-lumpur-congestion-crisis-car-sharing\">Will Uber and Grab help or hinder Malaysia's congestion crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo date, there are places we cannot go to although the police have assured us of our safety,\u201d says John Nganga, a driver on the Little Cab platform. \u201cThere will always be people fighting to control their turf.\u201d </p> <h2>Support from taxi drivers</h2> <p>In spite of these dangers, the workload for Nganga has gone up so significantly that he is considering upgrading his car. Both companies help new and existing drivers access credit to either buy their first car or get a bigger one.</p> <p>Not all traditional taxi operators are worried about Uber and Little Cab, despite the loss of custom. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people come into the city every day,\u201d said Peter Kimani, a taxi driver for the last 35 years. \u201cThey just look across the road, spot a taxi and ask for your services. We will continue to exist for them.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThose services may be cheaper but the difference is the customer experience. I can even carry you on credit if you are a regular,\u201d added Kimani. \u201cThey always think about money and targets. They are like robots.\u201d</p> <p>However, Nganga believes it is only a matter of time before those drivers not using the two ride-hailing platforms cross over.</p> <p>\u201cBeing on these services not only gives you an opportunity to earn a living, but network as well. I carry people from much more diverse backgrounds than I previously did,\u201d Nganga says. \u201cExposing me to opportunities not necessarily related to my taxi business.\u201d </p> <p>Even older, more sceptical taxi drivers have been willing to adapt. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t understand how this would work. Everything on the phone? Some of us have been in the business since the late 80s. This seemed a bit too much,\u201d says new Uber driver David Kamanja. The 67-year-old has been operating his taxi from the same spot, outside Nairobi\u2019s Hilton Hotel for decades. </p> <p>Uber and Little Cab may not have cut congestion or air pollution, but city officials in Nairobi remain supportive. \u201cAlthough these options have not solved all our transport woes, we recognise the fact that they continue to make things better for our residents,\u201d said Mohammed Abdulahhi, responsible for transport and infrastructure at the County Government of Nairobi.</p> <p>\u201cIn this case, these services have provided a cheaper and more reliable option for travellers. This way, the city becomes even more attractive to travellers and investors.\u201d </p> <p></p>",

  "<p>Derryn Hinch is unlikely to remember this, but way back in the 1980s I had a long, long lunch with him and several other journalists. I was editor of a television guide in Melbourne and he was the \u201cKing\u201d of talkback radio station 3AW. </p> <p>My memory of the lunch was that good wine flowed for hours, and so did the opinions of Hinch. He talked, a lot. He argued and held forth. He had a journalist\u2019s love of anecdote to prove a point and a radio presenter\u2019s self regard. I don\u2019t say that nastily. He was smart company, a big personality intensely interested in current events, who could puff himself up, but just as easily make a joke at his own expense.</p> <p>Watching Hinch\u2019s maiden speech to the Australian Senate this week, you couldn\u2019t help but witness his irrepressible personality, and wonder whether the 72-year-old Bearded One might turn out to be a good representative after all, in the sense of being candid, principled, sceptical of spin and tremendously energetic (when not nodding off). </p> <p>The crossbenchers who hold the balance of power in the Senate have their quixotic obsessions. Some like Pauline Hanson have ugly views on race and religion. Libertarian David Leyonhjelm is driven by ideology. Hinch says he\u2019s apolitical \u2013 a conservative on law and order but all-but a socialist on hospitals and medicine. He says he\u2019s going to listen and learn before making up his mind on legislation. Who knows? He just might end up an improbable voice of reason.</p> <p>Except for one thing: his sex offender crusade, and his determination to yell \u201cshame! shame!\u2019 as he names offenders in parliament. All perfect for a tabloid tub thumper, but not for a politician who aims to be more than a headline grabber.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/senate-reform-did-not-cause-pauline-hanson-to-return-heres-why\">Senate reform did not cause the return of Pauline Hanson. Here's why</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hinch has been a big figure in Melbourne my whole life, his career a roller coaster of highs and lows, loves and dramas, all revolving around Hinch. All have been played out in public to the point where many people, many times, have rolled their eyes and wondered when he\u2019ll disappear at last.</p> <p>That he has turned up as a senator five years after a donated liver saved his life is astonishing. He says he is \u201cgob smacked\u201d to be a senator after more than half a century working as a journalist, a job where you can criticise politicians as much as you like without having the responsibility of making decisions yourself. </p> <p>By his own admission, he\u2019s been sacked 16 times. He\u2019s been married five times, twice to Oscar-nominated actor Jacki Weaver. He\u2019s been rich and he\u2019s been poor. He\u2019s been convicted of contempt of court and related offences multiples times over his \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d sex offenders, and he\u2019s been jailed twice, the last time for 50 days in 2014. The Human Headline is, let\u2019s say, a character, and there\u2019s room for characters in politics.</p> <p>Listening to Hinch\u2019s debut was like tuning in to one of his radio editorials, but instead of lasting for a few minutes it went on for 47, surely heaven for Hinch. His speech skidded from topic to topic, from having met every prime minister since Robert Menzies, to covering the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, to opposing compulsory voting, to free speech, to dying with dignity, to paedophiles travelling to Asia, to ridiculing calls to ban Muslim immigration, to supporting same sex marriage. </p> <p>It was dizzying and entertaining, with Hinch full of confidence, his voice booming, his enthusiasm palpable. \u201cI will try to be an unpolitical politician, a commonsense politician,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not be politically correct. That is why I say from the outset that I have hopes, high hopes, of achieving good things.\u201d</p> <p>And yet Hinch couldn\u2019t help himself. His speech exposed the difference between a larger-than-life media commentator paid a lot of money to have provocative opinions, and a credible politician who does boring things like setting emotion aside to weigh up evidence and competing values. If he\u2019s going to be more than another Senate oddball known for grabbing media attention but little else, he\u2019ll get the difference. </p> <p>Hinch has been snubbing his nose at court-ordered suppression orders on identifying sex offenders for decades and he is a campaigner for a public national register for offenders. There is no doubt he feels passionately about this issue and no doubt he has considerable public support. And he has courage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/17/derryn-hinch-arrested-for-failing-to-pay-100000-fine\">preferring to go to jail in 2014</a> for breaching a suppression order rather than pay a large fine. Now that he has parliamentary privilege, there\u2019s no stopping him, and he named several convicted paedophiles, and vowed to name more.</p> <p>At least three of the people he named are subject to suppression orders in Victoria. Two of them he named at a rally in 2008, leading to five months\u2019 home detention for contempt of court (he would have gone to jail had he not been very ill at the time). How arrogant of him to name these men again just to make a point, knowing that if he did so outside parliament, he would have again broken the law. </p> <p>\u201cIt has been speculated that I will use parliamentary privilege to name names under the protection of what is derided as \u2018coward\u2019s castle\u2019, and I will,\u201d he said in his speech. \u201cBut it will be a court of last resort. I will not be a \u2018cowboy\u2019. But, if it is necessary to protect a child\u2019s wellbeing, then, damn right, I will name the human vermin.\u201d </p> <p>There was nothing \u201clast resort\u201d about his parliamentary stunt. It was a stunt. Even his arguments begin to wobble under scrutiny. His idea for a register is based on a US scheme that would allow the public access to a site that would include an offender\u2019s name, photograph, current address and criminal history. Hinch says the public has a \u201cright to know\u201d such information.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/26/derryn-hinchs-first-move-in-senate-will-be-to-oppose-ridiculous-media-rules\">Derryn Hinch's first move in Senate will be to oppose 'ridiculous' media rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Victoria\u2019s police commissioner Graham Ashton told 3AW this week that he understood the sentiment around such calls but the expert advice he had received was that there was <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/no-evidence-to-back-naming-sex-offenders/news-story/142907b8b16d0cd0997cc2018367e051 \">no evidence that it improved public safety</a>. He\u2019s right. <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-1899-7_17#page-1\">Study</a> after <a href=\"http:// https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/09/11/no-easy-answers/sex-offender-laws-us\">study</a> has shown that public registers have no impact on recidivism and do little to prevent sexual violence. The risk of vigilantes harassing offenders who have served their sentences is obvious. The prospects for offenders to get a job and rehabilitate would plummet.</p> <p>We already have sex offender registers in Australia, mostly for child abusers, but they can be accessed only by the police, not the public. Hinch says they are a PR joke, but the problems with them are not the ones he identifies. Ashton said that, in Victoria, there were now 6,000 people on the register, which requires a person to report to police and to provide up-to date-information including address, phone number, email, employment, social media use, interstate travel and even tattoos.</p> <p>The intent of the register was worthwhile \u2013 to protect the public and to help police investigate heinous crimes against children. Ashton said the problem was that there were so many people on it, it was impossible for the police to monitor it properly. That\u2019s the issue. There are far too many people on the register who pose little or no risk to the public and for whom constant monitoring is a waste of time and money.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.lawreform.vic.gov.au/content/sex-offenders-registration-final-report-html-version\">Victorian Law Reform Commission report</a> a few years ago said that if we keep going the way we are, there will be 10,000 people on the register by 2020, and that\u2019s just in Victoria (other states have similar schemes). </p> <p>These are the unintended consequences of politicians being pressured by people like Hinch and the law and order crowd who lazily demonise judges and magistrates for being \u201csoft\u201d on crime. Criminal barrister and vice president of Liberty Victoria Michael Stanton supports the register, but says it has become unwieldy and unworkable.</p> <p>Hinch\u2019s insistence that judges have far too much discretion about who they put on the register is wrong \u2013 there is no discretion in the vast majority of cases, one exception being where it is a child who has committed the offence. The commission recommended that to make the system work to actually protect the public, the government needed to \u201cstrengthen the scheme by sharpening its focus\u201d. In other words, give the judiciary some discretion and limit it to those who pose a continuing risk to children. </p> <p>One example the commission gave of someone who should not be on the register was a 19-year-old soldier who had consensual sex with two teenage girls which would not have been illegal but for their age. The judge had no alternative but to put the man on the register for life, even though she said he posed \u201cno risk to the sexual safety of the community\u201d. One consequence of being on the register is that a working-with-children check would mean he could never hold down a job that involves children. He could never even volunteer to coach a children\u2019s sporting team \u2013 for the rest of his life. </p> <p>The register is far from the only check on sex offenders. Victoria, like other states, has laws under which offenders who have finished their sentence but who pose a serious risk to the community can be subject to significant supervision, including restricting where they can live, continuing detention if necessary, preventing them from going anywhere near schools and other places where children gather, and wearing ankle bracelets to keep track of their whereabouts.</p> <p>As a journalist, I am sceptical of the large number of suppression orders issued in Australia, and will always argue that they should be kept to a minimum, with an open court system essential in a democracy. No doubt there are cases where suppression orders have been wrongly issued, yet in most cases they are put in place to protect the victim\u2019s identity. </p> <p>Hinch likes to portray a sex offender as a monster living across the road, but it\u2019s not true. Most children are molested by family members or someone known to them. In some cases, a suppression order is issued before an offender is released to give them a chance at rehabilitation, to get a job, find somewhere to live, and get on with a lawful life. In many cases, they are issued temporarily so an accused person can get a fair trial, a fundamental tenet of our justice system.</p> <p>In 2013, Hinch was found to have breached suppression orders by alluding to Bayley\u2019s extensive criminal record before he had pleaded guilty to the murder of ABC employee Jill Meagher. He revealed on his website that Bayley was on parole and on bail for other matters. It was messy \u2013 other journalists breached the order inadvertently, too \u2013 and there is a real question about the usefulness of suppression orders in an internet age when Bayley\u2019s crimes were all over the web.</p> <p>And yet, as horrific as Bayley\u2019s crime were, he was entitled to a fair trial without a jury being prejudiced by knowing his previous crimes. As it happened he pleaded guilty and the suppression orders were later lifted. Hinch was charged with breaching a suppression order regarding Bayley\u2019s record, refused to pay a fine and went to jail for 50 days, declaring himself a scapegoat and a whipping boy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/12/derryn-hinch-uses-parliamentary-privilege-to-name-sex-offenders-in-maiden-speech\">Derryn Hinch uses parliamentary privilege to name sex offenders in maiden speech</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why? Bayley posed no threat to anyone at this point \u2013 he was in custody. Hinch wasn\u2019t protecting anyone by outlining Bayley\u2019s previous offences. In our system, even the worst criminals are entitled to a fair trial \u2013 without that, none of us are. These are principles Hinch dismisses as somehow tiresome and irrelevant.</p> <p>Let\u2019s take one more example. In his 2004 memoir, The Fall and Rise of Derryn Hinch: How I Hit the Wall and Didn\u2019t Bleed, Hinch recounted that he had sex with a \u201cstupendously beautiful\u201d model he met at a boozy party in 1979. Hinch was then in his 30s and says he thought the woman was in her mid 20s. But she told him over dinner that she was a girl of 15. Hinch called it a \u201cdreadful mistake\u201d and said he never saw her again.</p> <p>A few years ago, <a href=\"http://www.humanheadline.com.au/hinch-says/friday-thoughts-01-nov\">he claimed the woman had contacted him</a> and told him she was actually 17 at the time, so above the age of consent. But let\u2019s say she was 15 as Hinch believed for many years. Under current law, Hinch could have been charged with a serious crime. It would be up to him to prove that he had reasonable grounds to believe she was older. If he failed to do so, he could have gone to jail, and would certainly have been put on the sex offenders register. </p> <p>If Hinch had his public register, his photograph, address and crime \u2013 with no mention of the circumstances \u2013 would have been available for any member of the public to see. His marvellous career would have been over. Trying to find another job would have been hard \u2013 he could never work around children. He couldn\u2019t be a teacher, a tram driver, or even volunteer to coach a kids\u2019 footy team.</p> <p>Would that have been fair? Should we have labelled Hinch \u201cvermin\u201d and exposed his address so that parents could keep their children away from him? As simply as Hinch would like to portray these issues, they are not always easy. There are competing interests and principles. There are complexities and different paths to achieve what we want \u2013 a safer community. </p> <p>Hinch will get away with shaming sex offenders in parliament because he can\u2019t be held in contempt of court if he does so. But it would still be contemptible. For a person of considerable integrity, who could do good in his twilight career, it would be beneath him. </p> <p><em>This article was amended on 16 September 2016 to reflect the fact that Derryn Hinch did not reveal the nature of Adrian Bayley\u2019s previous crimes, but rather revealed that he had a criminal history</em></p>",
  "<p>Brooklyn rapper Bobby Shmurda has accused the New York legal system of being prejudiced in his first interview since he took a seven-year plea deal earlier this month after being arrested on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/30/bobby-shmurda-pleads-not-guilty-guns-drugs-conspiracy-charges\">guns, drugs and conspiracy charges</a> in December 2014.</p> <p>Speaking to the <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/music/2016/09/bobby-shmurda-interview-rowdy-rebel\">hip-hop magazine and website Complex</a>, Shmurda \u2013 whose real name is Ackquille Pollard \u2013 accused the judge who oversaw his case as seeing him as a \u201cblack thug\u201d and said the case would have played out differently if he had made bail.
